3,A minor disappointment,"The underground gangstas have been waiting for this to drop since ""Otherside of the Law"" dropped. Those in the know, know that ""Otherside"" was an instant classic that only served to drive home the fact that the mainstream isnt interested in quality music. Ive had metal heads giving up accolades upon hearing this solid success. So that bieng said I waited impatiently for ""Silence"" to pop. There is definetly alot missing here. Devin is one of em, and DMG has a few songs on this album that are also on his solo album. To top it all off production is very lackluster. Its listenable but no real replay value. Kapone is the only real shining star here, and its just not enough. I wish I could say better, Much respekt Lil J & the whole entire Rap-A-Lot Mafia. Atleast they keep it original and so so gangsta!!"
3,Clear Reclosable Zipper Bags,The bags were fine. One thing that the bags needed was a white strip for writing down the contents. I would order more of them if they had the white strip.
1,plays at most less than 180 songs,"There are only two reasons for having an expansion slot, one is to be able to quickly and easily change the songs you can access, the other is to be able to listen to more songs at a time. This player doesn't support that second feature because there is a limit to the number of songs it can access at a time. Using only songs that I tested, and verified would play with the device, I found that it was impossible to to have the player display over 180 songs, This is a serious unforgivalbe deficiency in the product. I found that this problem persists even if all of the songs are in the flash memory, and not on the expansion card. This deficiency in not mentioned ANYWHERE in the documentation."
1,Make a different choice,Spend your money on a product that will work. My Rave-MP did not perform well.
1,short lived,"The good news the battery lasts for a long time, the bad news the battery lasted longer then the unit. The unit died within 3 weeks."
5,Best Ever!!,"These are really good. I bought 2 boxes just yesterday and I just opened the 2nd box ""/. Yes they are that good. :)"
3,"Tastes great, but Medium Quality","These are wheat thins, with some flavor added. The Flavor is very salty, and you can definitely taste the MSG that they added as a cheap way to spike the flavor. As far as i remember, you can't really taste the basil at all."
2,Very strong taste and has MSG,"I am disappointed since regular wheat thins don't have MSG, but this variety does. I need to stay away from MSG, since I get migraines.I am sure Nabisco can find a way to make a flavorful cracker without MSG.These crackers have a very strong taste, and I found that the taste stayed in my mouth for a long time.I prefer the original, unflavored wheat things."
1,Not much here,"I found precious little here. You might think that with the glowing reviews from famous people that this would be a useful book, but in fact the reviews aren't wrong - if you're a senator or a TV personality you'll find this book useful.The rest of us can give it a miss.Valenti may be a great speaker, but in terms of a book for everyone he offers little. You should remember your speech pretty much word for word. You should think of the cadence of how you'll deliver it. There really isn't much more, apart from long reminiscences about famous speeches and speakers. The book has a strange almost Victorian tone.To misquote one of the reviews - this is a dispensible resource. Spend your money on one of the books that teaches you a lot."
1,From Pre-PowerPoint Days!,Jack Valenti is definitely from the pre-PowerPoint days! I find it hard to believe that President Kennedy and other famous politicians and actors were as nervous before speaking or performing on TV as Mr. Valenti makes them out to be.
3,Kinda Like The Montauk Project,Michael Biehn is always classic. I bought this movie because I remember seeing it late one night and it was an amazing movie that had some resemblance to The Montauk Project (which isn't a movie to my knowledge yet). Montauk of course I know about from Al Bielek and Preston Nichols. I found the movie to be intriguing for its time. It's a worthy watch. It makes you wonder what our memories are. Biehn's character has false memories that were implanted in his head after being part of a supersoldier program. It's a worthy watch and a worthy purchase. I just wish it was on DVD.
5,review by mike.,"i have liked michael bien for a long time ever since the termaninator. this by far is my favorite film because it has tracey scoggins, michael bien, and patsy kensit. i think people would like this movie with these actors in it."
3,OLD SKOOL,NOT A BAD DVD THE ACTION IS VERY GOOD BUT THE STORY LEAVES A LIL BIT 2B DISIRED BUT BILLY BLANKS DOES A GOOD JOB AS A BAD GUY AND MICHAEL BIENH IS A GOOD LEAD
4,Elegant vocalist,"With her beautiful voice that varied from breezy to husky, Rita Coolidge was one of the unique voices of the seventies and eighties. This excellent compilation includes all of her greatest hits and some superb album tracks like her exquisite version of Leonard Cohen's Bird On A Wire.Her biggest songs are all here: the romantic We're All Alone, the inspirational (Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher And Higher, plus I'll Be Your Baby Tonight, I Don't Want To Talk About It, All Time High and her moving version of The Bee Gees' classic song Words. As a ballad singer, she added a depth of feeling to sometimes mundane lyrics, lifting the songs above the ordinary.Her covers of songs like Wishin' and Hopin' and Sweet Inspiration are elegant and accomplished. It's a pity that some great album tracks, for example Whisky Whisky from a now deleted album, have not been included. Nevertheless, this is a satisfying showcase of a splendid singer that is sadly missed."
4,Where's My Crew?,"No doubt this collection of Rita Coolidge hits is well worth the price. BUT why is it that MY CREW does not appear on any other CD than Lady's Not For Sale? MY CREW is the first song I heard by Rita and remains my most favorite. It was the 'B' side of FEVER and considered a 2-sided hit per Billboard data. The song speaks of committment, comradry, teamwork, etc., and perhaps a touch of constructive dependency in all walks of life."
5,beautiful story line,"like the movie. It is very beautiful, touching, sad, romantic, you name it all.love scenes: five starsactors: five starsstoryline: five stars"
4,"Tea: Yes, please, and I'll probably have another cup shortly","Overall, a very enjoyable movie, both story wise and visually.This is not a 'quickie' movie, get in get out. This story really paints the entire and complete picture of young girl's life and her first sexual encounter and is set back in time in Saigon. I enjoyed the characters and was surprised to find the leading man, more gentler than I would have expected (he's not a guy you'd find in a biker bar).There were some slow parts, for me, but I understand the desire to tell the whole story. I thought the mix of narration and actually being present in that moment very interesting. They also did a nice job with the sex scenes, though on some I wish they had moved the camera closer to the action or at least gave more hints of it.The ending was very good. You felt for both of the lovers and their journey of self discovery and growth.Too bad they didn't make a series..."
3,An autobiographical tale of lost loves that forever haunt,"This film had the potential to be like 1988's Cinema Paradiso but turned into an over-the-top excercise in too much steam on film. Nonetheless, the story behind the film is based on the life of Margaret Duras, and the explosion of emotion that resulted in a long ago love. Watching this film just might have you determined to never marry anyone other than your true love. And perhaps to not set yourself up for tragedy with one who is wholly inappropriate. Luckily she got to leave the country (Vietnam for France) and the continent (Asia to Europe) after losing him forever."
4,Bonnie,"Another movie I was wandering about. Movie is narrated in English, so it can be distracting when watching it."
4,A real tear jerker,It's about a girl who becomes a hooker to a wealthy oriental man. She uses the money to better enrich both her family and herself from poverty. However she dosen't count on both of them falling in love. The ending is beatufully done and you will certainly find yourself crying at the end.
4,Just beautiful,"I too have kept this movie in the back of my mind for some time. It truly is a love story. It shows that not all love is tied in pretty bows and survives time and space, but shows us that while love is alive it should be experienced and then cherished for all time."
5,delicious,"This is one of the most delicious movies about sex and coming of age in a long time. Tony Leung is the sexiest human being ever to wear a white linen suit. Duras' novel is faithfully and pain-stakingly honored by the screen play.Send me down the Mekong river in a fedora and braids, please."
3,Love the story line,I read all the other reviews online about this movie and I must say after viewing the movie I was very disappointed. I love the storyline but the expression of deep passion which could only be felt in the sex scene was always shown in darkness. This kind of deep passion could only be captured by the intimate scenes which was sort of hidden from the viewer.
3,I saw this awhile ago when on vhs,"Ths movie is a tab bit harder than soft porn. There are real looking sex scenes. As a matter of fact, the man and minor girl spent most of their time having sex in the movie.Her family was giving her a hard time, she wanted to get away, plus she had no friends in school, somewhat an outcast. She met this wealthy, predatorial Asian man who saw in her from the beginning, a convenient sex slave.He used her for sex, she used him for money to help her and her family out. It's an ok movie but an explicit label should be put on it. You will not want your children looking at this."
3,just aight 4 me,"I wanted to go see this right after watching ""Lolita"" which I picked up from Dominique Swain and Jeremy Irons in it. It's just shows a basic where this love story goes behind a French teenager to a Chinese/Japanese persona I'll say. This is was very shocking to me when I notice alot of drama, alot of chaos, alot of sex, alot of everything, y'khahmean. This is a good one to keep even tho I love it since ""Lolita"". This movie is so real and it's been rated the best where people called this ""erotic"", ""tasteful"", ""sexy"", ""controversial"", ""chilling"", ""underrated"", ""real hardcore"", you name it.And checkout the book by Marguerite Dumas also rightafter u get done w/ the film."
2,Disturbingly 'Romantic',"'The Lover', starring Jane March, has excellent direction and cinematography, and the acting is very smooth. Its true-to-time and place imagery is also quite captivating. However, the 'innocence lost' ethos goes overboard, with one-too-many sex scenes between an underage girl and an older French Indo-Chinaman. Adapting this story to film creates this inherent problem- how do you keep the story engaging without making it look like 'illegal' (read- 'child') soft porn. There's one scene in particular where the girl is essentially raped, and, the way the film progresses thenceforth, it is as if we are supposed to accept this offensive assault as an acceptable part of their relationship.I think people give this film 5 stars because they get swept away with the romantic reverie, while overlooking the reprehensible pedophilic realities."
3,'bad' scene in this title,"Disturbingly 'Romantic', December 30, 2002Reviewer: rattemause (see more about me) from Laos. There's one scene in particular where the girl is essentially raped, and, the way the film progresses thenceforth, it is as if we are supposed to accept this offensive assault as an acceptable part of their relationship.I personally agree with rattlesnakes that this part of the scene not only presents raping but also shows that women are treated as cheaps like been treated as a horker or so called prostitutes. I feel that this is an objectional scene which I think should be carefully reviewed for some rights to women. I think there is no respect to women in this part of the scene. Beside this scene, I think the rest are normal between couples. What I feel about this movie overall is o.k."
2,Annuad..No,"What can I say about The Lover! nothing much really..It is disappointing to say the least, especially if you expect a cinematic masterpiece follow up to The Name of the Rose. It is the story of an impossible relationship between a french young girl,and a chinese man in indochina, based on a story by Marguarite Duras. The first problem with the film is the casting of Jane March, who really does not have the sensuality and erotisicm of the french heroine she is playing..The performance is just dull.as for the hot intimate scenes, and the big question that arose at the time..did they do it or were they acting? to that I say, who cares really!!!a huge disappointment from a director that gave us Chariots of Fire, The Bear and of course The Name of the Rose."
3,IMPROPRIETY,"A coming of age tale set in 1929 Vietnam, when Vietnam was a French colony, based on the novel of the same name by Marguerite Duras. A young teenage girl (Jane March) begins a love affair with a much older wealthy Chinese man. The book is good but not really cinematic material. The film is highly sexual, mostly between March and this man having sex and a few scenes of her dysfunctional and economically challenged family. I have only ever seen Jane March in highly sexed roles, so I have no idea if she has any talent. This film shows her at barely 18 herself. For more views of her in this kind of role, see Color of Night with Bruce Willis."
4,A facet of what it is to be human~,"This film is far from mere ""porn"" [as erroneously noted by another reviewer]. It is an exploration of the connection between mind and body, which we are shown cannot really ever be separated; even if we'd often LIKE to separate them.The carefully-schooled Caucasian female protagonist flouts contemporary [early 20th century] prejudices by embarking on an affair with a young, wealthy and handsome Chinese man for the purposes of helping her impoverished family out financially, not because she really has any deep feeling for him. But is the affair really just lust and greed...? This film embodies the old axiom, ""you don't know what you have till it's gone.""It is an extremely beautiful film and the images stay with you for a long time afterward. Highly recommended."
4,The Lover,First this should have an NC-17 rating at the minimum. Adult content and nudity throughout the movie. Beyond this I would say it is a period movie set in the 1930's. The story is not new in the sense it's an inter=racial couple having an affair. Good scenery shots. Just something to add to my collection as I am a big Jane March fan.
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"The love scenes were good and worth it, but the plot was severely lacking. Nothing happened. The two lovers simply met, had sex, then parted again. The lack of commitment for both of the characters made the story kind of unbelievable and very hard to relate to. I would recommend the movie if you're just interested in the love scenes, but if you're expecting a well-thought out movie, it's doesn't measure up."
2,Let's call it what it is,"My last blurb for this video didn't show up, so let's try again.It's just classy soft-core, and borderline child porn at that. (Any redeeming quality you can point to is strictly technical and available in many movies of the same sort shown late at night on Cinemax or Showtime.) I give it two stars instead of one because if that's what you're looking for, you'll be pleased."
1,"Don't be fooled by its pretention to ""Art""","This movie is beautifully photographed and well acted and based on a short novel people love. So is it Art? No. It's soft-core faux kiddie porn. The girl is barely a woman -- her thin frame and flat chest turn the nude love scenes between her and a mature man into scenarios of child statutory rape.... If you disagree, consider it without the sexuality. Not much left, is there? (And don't say the sex is necessary. Why wasn't it necessary in American films for the first fifty years?)"
4,Still playing,"I bought this game a long time ago and i still play it today. great game, soundtrack is awesome, takes awhile to unlock all the planes but its possible"
4,GREAT AND SERIOUS FUN,"If you like AC5, this game challenge everything you did before. More dogfight than ever. And that traitor called Pixy, to beat him will frustrate you more than once. A real duel. However this game is a little short. I highly recommend it."
4,Best Ace Combat,"A must purchase for all aviation game freaks. Great graphics, great fun. The only reason I gave the game 4 stars because of difficulty and some minor plot confusion but other than that add this game to your cart-its a blast."
3,Disappointing Ace Combat game,"I am a huge fan of Ace Combat. I like this game, but I would wait until the price dropped to $20. It isn't worth losing sleep over if you don't have it yet. I waited with great anticipation thinking ""how will NAMCO surpass Ace 05""? Well, they didn't. I finished the game the first time on Hard Level in 3 hours 15 mins. I hope they do better with the next one. The bar is set at Ace05..."
2,The new gear wrench blows,"I lost my 9/16 reversable Grear Wrench and ordered this one from Amozon. The new wrench does not have the lip on it, and alows the fastner to pass thru it. If I wanted this I would have ordered the regular Gear Wrench that you flip over. 2nd... the person I ordered it from was not in Texas (my state) but the Item was, so I had to pay tax on it."
1,Pre electric shave lotion,Very expensive and no better that the commercal product I purchased at the local drug store. Very few products on the market. This particular one is over priced and much overrated!
1,Didn't Love It,"I felt let down by this book. The author is enthralled by his own genitals and men who change their genitals. Good comic material. Unfortunately, this book reads more like a long plane ride with a lecherous fop sitting to your right than a funny or biting adventure. There's not much to love about this one."
2,ok,"it was ok but not that good. it was trying to hard to be funny so it wasn't very funny like dave eggers or nick hornby or those guys who are more ""real' writers instead of this ames character who is more of a ""P.R."" kind of a guy. i got this book used because it's not in the bookstores anymore which is weird because it's pretty new so i guess that means it wasn't popular but i can sort of see why. he'd be better and more fun to read if he didn't try and make you feel so sorry for him. i do feel sorry for him which is why i gave him two stars instead of one."
5,The Man with the Chipper Zipper,"Reading ""What's Not to Love"" is like travelling with Walter Middy to a sex shop or getting to know the secret life of Woody Allen. Jonathan's amazing talent for relating things with understated humor and matter-of-fact delivery that most people would be embarrassed to admit they've thought about is the unity in this wildly funny book. How many guys actually talk about their fears of getting gas when making love to a woman for the first time? There's nothing less romantic than a little flatulence. And who could relate with such humor things like colonics, penile warts, or cataloging the most curvaceous waitresses while on holiday? Not a book for prudes or those who think the spiritual is at war with physical, this is an endearing ride through quite personal, brilliantly related sexual insecurity. I could call Jonathan the man with the chipper zipper. Don't miss out on this extraordinary tail. :)"
5,"Not for your mother, but....","Are you uncomfortable with stories about sex, farts, poops, or foreign objects in your food? If so, then you ought to relax and learn to laugh about life. That is what this book brings to the table: bold, uncensored, honesty about many aspects of life that we are often too timid to talk about or even think about for very long. Remember the thoughts you had when you were 14 years old? The time you saw something you shouldn't have, but your mind took off into fantasy? Jonathan Ames tells his (or his alter ego's) tales of embarrassment, insecurity, bizarre fantasy, and strange experiences. Not only is this book full of oddities, it is extremely funny. Read the book. Then go check out Jonathan Ames in person. His readings are events not to be missed. Perhaps he'll even arm wrestle you for a free book."
4,mildly perverted young readers unite,"I liked it. Through a string of what were once newpaper columns, we see what must be a coming-of-age story. It was a quicky fairly painless read (except for the parts that hit too close to home.) It's nice to read something so honest about living alone, dating and trying to find your place in the world."
3,useful but not broad enough,"The subject of topology lends itself to many different kinds of experimentation for undergraduate students. But this book spends a disproportionate amount of space on the Mobius strip and related non-orientability issues when it could deal with more knot theory and homotopy theory than it does, and it could introduce finite topologies and Morse theory which abound in self-exploration."
5,Part of a whole was fabulous,Part of a Whole was a great book of poetry! This book made me want to write poetry or at least express my feelings in written expression! I would buy any books written by Mr. Brown!
5,Great Poetry,"Jamie Brown has a way with poetry, if you want to read some romantic poetry this in the collection for you."
5,Stone Temple Pilots make a dent in rock history,"This is their first commercial single they've released, but for a good cause as all sales will go to the relief fund.STP first played ""Revolution"" for a tv special originally as a Beatles, John Lennon tribute, but was delayed after Sept. 11th. Shortly after, the concert became ""Come Together, A World Trade Center tribute"" and STP emerged the bright shining glory of the night. It's not suprising since this veteran underdog Rock band has surfaced in spurts from good times to bad times with breakthrough music and artistry.This single and studio version of the beatles cover, ""Revolution"", is classic Stone Temple Pilots mixed with the Beatles classic rocker. Bringing modern rock into the classic rock ingredients. Recommend for anyone new or old."
4,Good and Good for You,"This is a nice little single, especially for the price. A great song by a great band covered by a newer good band. Plus, all the proceeds for to charity. What else could you want?"
3,Mildly entertaining,"This game kept me busy on idle afternoons as a teenager, but you can only drive around virtual streets in virtual cities so many times before you get bored. I'd expect to get about two to three months of entertainment out of these games, but that's not bad for the price. Of course, they are quite dated now."
4,word up! brinka!,"me and my friends listened to this CD on our way to a st patrick's day party a couple years ago and it has haunted our minds since that day.the best songs are the ones that go: ""i want my sega sega. who's got my sega sega?"" and ""i want to dance dance dance to get to the chance chance chance to romance romance romance to get in your pants pants pants. word up! brinka!"" the songs are just infectious and they will not ever leave your mind. once you hear them, they will be in your mind for years and years. i love this cd and there is no way you won't no matter who much you try"
3,essential only for the faith no more virgin,"yeh this album contains all the classic faith no more tunes, and if you like this, you'll probably learn to love the less user friendly tracks. I like the length for the album, as best ofs tend to be a little too long, but this doesn't mean they had to miss out caffiene OR everything's ruined. As the Worm Turns would have been nice as well since it was a live favourite, and the last tune they ever played. Another draw back which always gets me is that; once you listen to this album too much, when you finally hear album of the year, you wonder why they put Stripsearch as the 2nd track!!Brillaint if you're a first time Faith No More fan, but it's useless to me now"
4,Unlike Any Other,"This album hints at the wondrous, amazing possibility of this band. Yes, hits but there's so much more. Lots of great ones here, for sure. Enjoy!"
4,For beginners.,"Not so much a best of ,moreso a best known of.Features all the main tracks off all the albums.All the ""Hits"" are here.If you are a fan you probably own all these tracks,if not its the perfect INtro."
3,Better At One Disc,"I want to give this a five star review, as a FNM collection should deserve, but it falls short for a couple of reasons. For one, it includes only the commercial singles and none of the great album tracks that made this band so engaging (i.e, ""Be Aggressive"", ""Zombie Eaters"", ""Kng For A Day"", etc.). But don't get me wrong, the singles themselves are all winners. The bigger problem with WHO CARES A LOT? is the horrible second disk. Save ""I Won't Forget You"" these selections are unlistenable and definetly best left in the vault. This second disc would have best been used for said album tracks or perhaps some of the band's cool B-side material. Again, not a worhless collection, just poorly selected."
4,"Lots of hits, but missing a few things","""Who Cares A Lot"" takes the very best of FNM's US singles, but ignores UK hits such as ""Ricochet,"" ""Be Aggressive,"" and ""Anne's Song."" The bonus disc provides FNM fans with a good reason to buy this compilation. ""The World Is Yours"" and ""This Guy's In Love With You"" show the diversity of FNM's style. The lack of liner notes concerning origins of bonus material may irritate fans, but this album is perfect for a FNM novice."
5,Ah!!! A Magestic Drive... I mean CD,"This ""Greatest Hits"" CD is a ""Greatest Hit"". Who Cares A Lot? proves that Faith No More isn't just about ""Epic"". The second CD provides long-time fans with rare tracks, like ""The World Is Yours"", and Burt Bacharach song ""This Guys In love With You"". The CD has it all. In conclusion, this CD kicks corporal corpulence madly!"
2,unreal,This book did nothing for me and after the third member of an Amish family went against his own priciples I finally put the book down.The main character Alan was the only person true to his own nature of being jaded and cynical. Alan was beginning to experience a subtle transformation that was believable and held my interest. But the ease in which Susan set aside her own value system to be at Alan's beck and call was uncharacteristic of someone raised in an Amish community.
4,Time To Go Back,"I really liked this book. I am not a huge science fiction fan, but I read this for a Children's Lit. class and really enjoyed it. It contained a mixture of factual history and time travel. I became really interested in whether or not Sarah would change the history of her life or not, and I liked the fact that it was set in WWII and was told from England. It gave a different perspective of the war than those that deal with it from the American perspective."
5,Karl Denver is my new god,"A good friend turned me on to Karl by playing Lonesome Traveller and I was hooked. Karl Denver's sound is an incredible synthesis of early 60's styles. Hell, just listen to Lonesome Traveller back to back with If I had My Way. Buy the album and prepared to be amazed. The only possible issue you will have is that you might start trolling ebay to buy vintage Karl vinyl: this compilation is not enough! In fact I now judge my musical friends by their Karl reactions. The only negative thing I can say about this compilation is that having now listened to many of the records, I think the song selection was a bit safe, without some of his weirder more wonderful stuff.Unbelievable that this guy is Scottish. You have to wonder what would have happened if he got to stick around Nashville and didn't have to skip the country to avoid being deported.Amazon is doing itself a disservice by not allowing previews on this one."
1,Only one song,Having had two Karl Denver LPs I had hopes for this disc to supplement my raritys. Only Wimoweh was worth while. The other songs left me wondering why I bought this CD.
5,This is your chance to get to know the Great Ralph Stanley,"As a result of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", Ralph Stanley is finally reaching reknown beyond bluegrass fans. Hard core bluegrass fans have known for decades that Ralph Stanley is the premier male mountain singer....this collection will let everyone else know that Stanely is a great singer...period! This collection is a mini-retrospective of Stanley's solo work during the seventies. I'm sorry I missed these songs when they were originally issued because this is bone-chilling, hair-raising mountain singing. Every cut on this CD is a gem; the standout being ""Old Richmond Prison,"" a paen to regret, loneliness and isolation that'll convert you for sure."
4,Scary Good,"It was only a matter of time before greater America woke up to Bluegrass music, the big-beat music with no drums that's been in our backyard for generations.Ralph Stanley sings songs of sorrow and he means it; I think the scary feeling many listeners talk about comes from Stanley hitting home, a deadeye bullseye on some archetypical fears.Great fiddle playing, too."
3,Ralph Stanley's Man of Constant Sorrow,I thought I was getting the ones who recorded the song and sang it in the movie. I am not satisfied with this CD at all. Listened to it once and that was enough. Wish I could exchange it.
4,got a short time to stay here and a long time to be gone,"The (over)production here is a bit slick -- the giddy fiddle and animatronic banjo combo make me a little queasy on some of the songs. Stanley vibrates his nasal septum like a sax reed. If your scrotum needs tightening, this will do it."
4,Real kids making real food,"These recipes were just what children like, but seemed healthy too. The recipes were easy to understand and I loved the glossary explaining cooking terms."
3,My opinion of God's Leading Ladies,The album was ok. I personally didn't care for it and was quite upset about that because I loved some of the artists on there and I especially like a lot of music or albums T.D. Jakes produces. It was just OK.
4,No Big Mystery,CSI is great. One of the hottest shows on TV what else could be expected of the game. Audio and voice effects are outstanding.
3,CSI/CSI MIami/CSI Dark Motives Triple Pack,"This product is more or less what I expected. Being a 3 for 1 though, it lacked the quality of a single game. The first problem I came across was that the Dark Motives game and CSI Miami games had the wrong labels on the CD. Then, the worst problem was that while playing the Dark Motives, all the information was in French and after unsuccessfully trying to fix the problem, had to play the whole game in French. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone, unless you are bilingual."
2,All three CSI games in the package,All programs have many bugs and even the patches do not seem to fix them. Must follow specific steps vice using hunch to gather evidence to solve the cases. I could not get CSI #1 last case - I had all the evidence but the program did not agree. If smoother game play then it would be a great game. Another downside was that the CSI Miami game was on the CSI Dark Motives CD and visa versa! But with all this said I am a fan and will probably get CSI 3 & 4.
4,Found what I was looking for,I looked for this item in every store in my area and noone carried it. Found it on Amazon for a great price! Item was received in original package and unopened.
2,Game Problems,The first 5 games in the first set (CSI Investigation)were loads of fun and I had absolutely NO problems. In Dark Motives I cannot play the first game for all the glitches and double taping. I am very disappointed in this one. I went to CSI web site and found (patches) but it did no good.Any suggestions?
4,fastrax refill rolls,"these bags work great for the purpose,but sometimes they are hard to open.Overall I will be buying them again."
5,Great Product!,"Easiest to use of all the doggie poop bags, it's both sturdy, capacious enough for leavings from our 90 pound behemoth and biodegradable. Much better in every way than the more readily available 'Bags on Board'."
2,works,Works well with the Firstrax barrel/holder. It is longer/taller that the other brand. So it does not fit the other holder. But it works for whats needed.
4,center pull bags,"excellent value; a bit hard to separate one bag from the other and one side from the other; still, they work and are strong enough"
1,Got a dog and a nasty landlord?,"I checked all over for bags to clean up after Buddy the wonder dog. He is a service canine and a woderfull dog that daily gives his life to assist me. When I had a home and could keep it up, he could see me need to bend over to pick up after him and was so smart, he would go back to the end of the property in the woods to go, to save my pain. I have arthritis of the spine.I wish I was that intelligent and considerate.Now going to dog walking parks and renting, I must be considerate and have found these bags very reasonable and do the job fine.Whats not to like, the world is good and Buddy, nicknamed Hollywood, cause he is a star that just loves everyone. When we drive through town, everyone says, HI BUDDY, and nothing for me LOLOLOLOL. he does deserve the hello's ten times over and these bags help all off us be good people to others and are cost effective."
4,Great bags.,"These are good convenient bags that pull from middle, not roll from end. Hard to find. More expensive than I would like."
5,Great Poop pick up bags,"These are great bags! I use them in my top load bag holder, and they work GREAT, and no mater how messy nothing gets on your hands!"
3,Mildly Entertaining...,"I am a huge fan of (almost) anything Dragon, and so when I came across this book I knew I would have to read it. The plot is simple and the human characters moderately interesting, although I don't feel either rates the title of ""epic fantasy.""The one saving grace of the story that will cause me to continue reading the series is the tiny glimpse of the history and culture of the Dragons the author gives. Hopefully in the remaining two books, the (rather dull) world of the humans will take a backseat and the world of the Dragons will be explored in depth and detail."
2,"Age inappropriate for pre-teens & ""tweens""","I've bought many of the Weis/Hickman Dragonlance books for my son over the past couple of years. He has been greatly delighted in the writing, so I bought him the Dragonvald Trilogy. He, of course, read them immediately before I could get to them. When I finally got to Mistress of Dragons, I was extremely unhappy with the in depth lesbianism, crude references to heterosexualism and the graphic description of a violent rape. I felt these depictions were not suitable for pre-teens or ""tweens"" and I was greatly upset that nowhere was there any indication that these topics were included so responsible parents would be able to make an informed choice as to whether or not to allow their children to read such a story."
2,Mistress of Disappointment,"Being a fan of Weiss and Hickman, I looked forward to this independent writing with much enthusiasm. What I learned from reading this book is how important Tracy Hickman's contributions have been to past books; particularly in character developement and also the ease with which I was brought into the tale.The first chapters of Mistress of Dragons brought immediate reminders of an earlier book by Marion Zimmer Bradley. They are so similar I was experiencing flashbacks of that tale while trying to read through this one. I also wondered why the love scene between Edward and Melisande received no description, yet the description of the very violent rape was quite detailed. It seemed out of place in this story.I will pass on the sequel to this tale."
3,Basic sword and sorcery affair,"i'm not going to say that this one was bad, but it certainly wasn't all that impressive. although the thought of the dragon ruling and empire and hiding from other dragons is interesting and there is a great mix of magic religion and science there is so little characterisation and the thing moves so fast that you can't really get to know anybody anyway.so while the premise is a good one, this is not a book i would buy, not even in paper back. read it in the book store or get it from the library.so not impressedsilver"
1,Big Zero here,"Not sure what the lesbian relationship was supposed to add to this otherwise lackluster book, but it didn't work. Lacked the swashbuckling, cliffhanging appeal of Weis's other books, like she was tired and just trying to pull something together. I was sorely disappointed and wasted my money on this one!"
1,"Shallow, Simplistic, and Stupid","I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, they were quickly dashed. I don't know why Weis didn't team up with Hickman as is her wont. But, the lack of a second author dooms the effort. The book has an interesting premise, but is filled with inconsistencies, triteness, and plain ol' stupidity. If Hickman had been around, they could have bounced the material off each other and corrected most of the bad writing before it hit the shelves. As it is, it's practically un-stomachable. I put the book away about half way through it as not being worth the effort. But, I later picked it up and finished it in the hope it would get better. It didn't. It got worse. I was practically gagging by the end. Stay away from this book and its series."
1,Pass on it.....Weak Read.,This is by far the worst of all her books. Did she have to meet a book obligation deadline or something with her publisher? The storyline was not strong and the characters were weakly developed.
3,Below Average,"Being a fan of Margeret Weis, I was really looking forward to this book. I had just read Tracy Hickman's first Bronze Canticle book, and while I found it to be just ok, at least there were some original elements within it. I can not say the same for this book. There is nothing new or unique in this novel. The writing is not what I would expect from her, and the characters are not interesting. The main male lead seemed okay enough as we are introduced to a loving wife and dutiful son, but he grows unlikeable as he lusts after another woman. It is also unrealistic that a king would go off alone with a total stranger on a quest. The man female lead is a very bland priestess. The lesbian angle is interesting, though she seems to forget that she is gay for one chapter in order to advance a plot point. All in all, this is not a good Margares Weis book."
2,ERM! where exactly is the toy! They would make better ornaments!,"it's too little stuff for the money you pay. And dolls can't play instruments, that toy should be sold for $5! it looks cool though. They would make better ornaments!"
1,WHAT !! 1 STAR IS THE LOWEST I CAN GO !!!,god that toys sucks!!! I don't now why I bought it looks cool but it sucks !! it's impossible to make your dolls use the instrument arghh!! ANYWAY the point is that theres no point in buying this toy!!!
5,SOUND OF LIGHT-STEVEN CRAVIS,"Delightful melodies, charming and catchy. You'll be humming them over and over again in your head. This album makes me smile. It is childlike in its simplicity yet clever twists and turns keep your from being bored. The listener feels like they are gently gliding in the air over hills and dales as the melodies rise and fall. As a pianist, his technique is good but rather straight forward - could feel more sensitive but a wonderful addition to any instrumental collection. Highly recommend!"
3,I agree with secondnature review... could use editing.,"I have read many RV travel books. This book has good subject matter, however, I find it strays again and again to the ""isn't the wonder of the computer world amazing"" theme. When published, this may have had more impact, but now the ""wonder"" is old news. I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the last."
3,Good book but in need of an editor,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. It was great to see how they dealt with what could have been considered a tragedy and turned it into a good thing. I do think she could have benefited from an editor --her thoughts were not always well organized and she tends to stray away from her subject and wander into disconnected thoughts."
4,Very Stimulating and Technical,"When you start to read the book, Simon gently immerses you into the VST world. Describes very useful short cuts using the keyboard (and also a few tips that aren't easily found in other reference materials). The project work takes you through the initial recording right through to mastering using an awful lot of the VST functionality. If you're like me and can't afford the usual electronic hardware that goes into the home studio, the VST FX and mastering techniques that Simon uses will show you that, with the right computer system, you can be very creative with what is available.All in all, a well laid out book, which I keep constantly by the side of the monitor (just in case)."
3,"Cubase 3.5 that is, not 4 . . .","You will not recognize the screenshots in the book if you are using VST 4, it is first for PC then for Mac (unfortunate), Mac commands are lsited in parentheses, and screen shots/dialog boxes usually don't give the Mac command.Don't buy this if you are really interested in Score (as I am), it is suprememly lacking in this regard and you will feel ripped. It would have been nice to see features such as how to copy from arrangement to arrangement without losing your staff settings, and how to manage your score displays more efficiently.I would like to see an edition for 4.x with heavy on the score please, Simon has created a lot of hype, and the VST pdf manual works almost as well. He does a favor with his reviews of audio, but always slanted toward PC's, good for PC users."
4,Is it so...,"If you're after a good and FAST guide to Steinbergs Cubase VST, I think you will find this book REALLY attractive. Millward wrote this book, when he was into Cubase development, and along the way, his important notes came to be a whole book! This is the one and only book for the real Cubase user, I really mean it! /Felix King"
5,The Age of Empires is Here!,"All I can say is WWWOOOWWW!!! The campain is GREAT, the scenario creater is COOL, and the whole thing is just PERFECT! I love all the strategy and creating so many new scenarios to play with my cousin. The graphics are perfect, state of the art, and one of the best unit lists I have ever seen! You see, I love strategy games and could play them all day. Out of all, Age of Empires II is one of my #1 choices to play! I 10,000,000% say you should get this game. I also give a 10 out of 10 stars to the makers. Outstanding!!!"
4,Great classic!,I still think the Age of Empires series was one of the best. Warcraft pretty much started this genre of games but every other company were just copycats of it and Age of Empires made the best copycat up until Dawn of War 1. AoE 2 is nostalgic gaming in the genre now but it was one of the best while it lasted.
5,oldies are the goodies,its strange....rise of nations improved on everything from this game and u can make the timeframe not go pass medieval age(to stay in the ages of this game)....but even though it improved eveyrthing...it just doesnt hold a candel to this game
1,Gold edition??????????,"Aren't gold editions supposed to have both the age of kings and the expansion kit for a cheaper price? Just got my game, and when installing, the game complains that without Age of Kings installed that the conquerors expansion kit cannot install. I called Microsoft support and told them that I am installing a gold edition, and they said that gold editions only include the expansion kit for double the price. Never mind that both this Amazon and Microsoft site says that the gold edition includes both. Thank you Bill Gates. I guess he is trying to recoup some of the losses at the stock market....I wan't my money back. Don't buy anything microsoft."
3,Nice but not that much fun,"My Title tells it all. I think it was well done,but it really couldn't hold my interest. I'm not sure why I lost interest but it just didn't have a compelling reason to go on."
5,IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!,"This game is MUCH better than civilization 3!!! It features close up action, about 100 war units, and new cheats!"
5,You will never grow out of this game...,"I started playing age of empires 7 yrs ago...then moved on to AOE 2 when it came out around 4-5 yrs ago...also bought the expansion shortly after it came out too.This game combines strategic planning and battleship...there are so many variables so you won't get bored playing this, especially if you play on the internet against other people. The graphic is pretty good too, considering it came out years ago. Just a few days ago AOE 3 has came out, it has even better graphic but with smaller number of civ available, plus there aren't many people playing it online yet. I still think AOE 2 is the best game, it's not too complex but not to simple and never same."
5,Age of Empires 2 is cool,"My husband and kids love this game. They would play it for four or five hours a day if I would let them. They have hooked three computers together and play it whenever they get a chance. They have Age of Empires 1, and they think this one is way cooler. I'm impressed that they can connect the scenarios to their history lessons and learn some geography along the way, too."
4,Much better than the first.,"A remake of a classic strategy and war game. It improves on many of the features the original AOS has such as unit queing (sp?) and waypoints. Definitely enjoyable. However, some civilizations are seriously overpowered... play around and enjoy yourself, but you can get slaughtered in multiplayer. Download the balance patch as soon as you are able."
5,One of my favorite movie ever,"I was so glad to find this movie on Amazon! I have seen it a long time ago. It still produce the same effect on me. The story is so beautiful - it is about a leson (of life) that a wild animal can teach to a man. But all the team (the director, the actors etc.) did a great job - I have nothing to comment on the negative side."
5,SIMPLY A WONDERFUL MOVIE!,"I knew nothing about bears when I watched this movie, and now I want to know everything.The stars of the film are animals first, then two humans. I have never seen such amazingly skillful work with animals as in this film. And the two male actors play their roles perfectly.The main star of the film is a cub (Youk), 5 months old. Be prepared to lose your heart and be continually amazed, educated and entertained.I'm so lucky I came across a review of this film while surfing Amazon.com. I had never heard of it, but the reviews convinced me to purchase the DVD.One of the greatest film experiences of my life!"
3,The Bear,I know this is a great film but I cannot watch in on my DVD in Australia. I thought that US/Aus would be compatible and it isn't. Unfortunately you need to open the package to try to watch it and by opening the package I now can't return it! This was a complete bummer.
1,Amazon reviewers really let me down,"This is PG movie so I checked the reviews before I took my three kids to see it as part of the kids summer movie deal at the local Ultrastar. Seemed fine, a great movie.THIS IS NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS.I'm sure this movie has it's techincal marvels and pure nature but I've just had to remove three very upset crying children from the cinema,(ages 4, 6 and 9. )This may have a PG rating but there is far to much in the way of blood and gore and death in the first thirty minutes to upset even a 37 year old mother. Mother bear killed in rock slide, hunters shooting, blood splattering, horses stamping on people. This kind of movie has a time and a place and a kids movie it is not."
1,"You're joking, right?","Can you say anthropomorphization? I would have loved to hear a director's commentary on the DVD that went something like this: ""When they first approached me about directing this film, I thought 'What the heck do I know about bears? Okay, I'll do it!'"" This is the silliest, most insulting movie I've seen in a long time, and I watch a lot of movies. The only redeeming factors in this film were the scenery and the inherent beauty of the wildlife."
1,Hands Down The Most Boring Movie Ever Created.,"How this movie is getting a total rating of 5 stars based on all the reviews is beyond belief.Everything about this movie is terrible.It is boring and has no real meaning to it.This is hands down the most boring movie ever made.If you are looking for good movies,watch anything with Adam Sandler,anything with Jim Carrey(except for the Grinch and The Majestic),and anything with Chris Farley(except for that movie he did with Matthew Perry).Watch any of those because the Bear is the most boring movie ever created.I Hope this review helped.Peace Out."
1,A rip off.,"Finally sat down to watch the bear. I noticed the DVD looked spotty. This was sold to me as ""used, good as new"" Good as new isn't even close. The DVD started to play, then stopped, then skipped to another spot, played for a little bit, then it was like watching photgraphs the way it jumped around, then it froze. This is what the vendor calles GOOD AS NEW???? PUH-LEEZE. And it is not our player. I rent DVD's from Red Box and they play just fine. Would NEVER order from this vendor again. I want my money back."
5,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILM IN THE WORLD,"THIS IS AN OLD AND TIMELESS STORY - VERY LITTLE DIALOGUE, BUT INCREDIBLE VISUAL EFFECTS AND EXCELLENT ACTORS!! I BELIEVE IT WAS REFORMATTED FOR CD AND IT HAS RETAINED ALL OF ITS ORIGINAL BEAUTY."
3,Nice movie,"Nice movie, glad I saw it but probably won't watch again.Was in good shape for a ""used"" product. Received it quickly too."
5,the bear,"I loved this movie so much that I bought several and sent them to youth centers. The scenery is spectacular, great fun and drama"
5,"The life of the ""North American King of Beasts""",The Bear is a great movie for the entire family. My two young children throughly enjoyed watching the big bear taking care of the baby bear. The best scene in the movie is the last scene where the big bear comes to the aid of the baby bear facing a cougar.
1,Not a children's movie.,"Way to sexual and too many suggestions for a children's movie. We felt like we were watching animal pornography. Shame on entertainment. We expected a cute little bear story. Living on a farm and breeding dogs, we know what animals do...but to have such a focus on this...plus the illustration of hallucinogen use was shameful. And, we wonder why children and young people do what they do today."
1,This is not a film - it's just animal rights propoganda.,"It was with great enthusiasm that I rented this film, expecting a grand tale of nature & the habits of bears...only to be shocked and disappointed at the blatant animal rights propoganda that it spews out. From the obviously skewed image of the hunters as ruthless pigs, to the most shocking: actual dubbing of human infant voices and whimpering on a cub bear, as if the bear were a human baby. Made without regard for the true lives of bears and to put out an anti-hunting message. For undeniable proof of such, it was made with support from The Human Society of the United States, a terrorist animal rights group with an official sounding name to fool you, but in truth it has no connection to any government agency at all.All true conservationists, avoid buying this movie, as you are simply funneling money into the anti-hunters hands. I wish I could give it a negative 5 stars."
1,NON! NON! NON! NON! NON!,"This should have never even been published ""full-screen"" on a DVD for god's sake! Where's the non-fake, real ""full-screen"" widescreen version? The primitive morons, this has been plaguing so many movies that they released that even came out in VHS wideseen after the lame DVD release!Best movie ever that doesn't have a widescreen DVD of it at this late date for stupid region ONE!DEATH TO MOVIE REGIONS!"
3,"Worthwhile, beautiful, and sometimes a bit silly - and criminal not to be widescreen","I remember this fondly, though I also remember it feeling silly and manipulative in parts.Great wildlife photography, and great bear `performances', but there's also a very Disney(the bad side) element mixed in; the anthropomorphic attempts to capture what the bear`thinks' and feels. It makes a beautiful semi-documentary approach to a real story suddenlyfeel fairly tale like in a distracting way.I also have to dock this a star for being full screen. The strongest element of the filmwas the wonderful photography. Eliminating a huge chunk of that image is crazy."
3,beautiful cinematography,"I remember when this movie came out how moved I was by the wonder of nature expressed in it. When we were looking for nature movies for our children, i thought of this one. Unfortunately, I seem to have forgotten about the hunters tracking the bears, the fact that there is a major conflict about every 10 minutes, and the buckets o' blood. This is fairly heavy-handed in its condemnation of hunters and its praise of nature, but if you can get past the ""man is bad"" sermon, this is worth watching. Just make sure you aren't trying to watch it with small children!"
4,Great deal!,"A bit cheaper than buying from Dave Ramsey's site directly. Wish it was real leather for thes price, but you can't have everything. :)"
3,Okay because of the quality of envelopes,"For the price, we expected more.Pros:Does the jobCons:Expensive to buy printed on cardstockWouldn't have bought it again, but was good to get in the swing of things Dave's way.."
3,Budget,"Good product, daughter wants one, just wish it had a larger capacity I have a lot of bills to budget."
1,Leather - you have to be kidding me,That is the cheapest leather I have ever seen. Also what is with some of the pages being upside down! I bought this for my wife as a companion to the book. She is pretty disappointed.
2,gift for daughter,I gave this envelope system to my daughter for Christmas as a method for her to manage money more effectively. She has not started to use it yet but I am hopeful it will be valuable in the future.
3,Bulky but helpfull.,"I got mine free with another deal where I got Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover Book.There are 6 envelopes attached to the book itself. There are another 4 that are loose. It comes with a pen, a note pad, a clear plastic sleeve for coins, 5 slots for debit cards and a place for your check book.I like how it forces you to organize yourself. I keep my checkbook and cash in it. However, it's very bulky. I don't actually carry it around with me, I don't like the idea of carrying that much cash around. I just take out what I need each day. It would probably work best for someone who carries a purse or briefcase.It's a nice thing to have, but I probably would not have purchased it on it's own. You could probably build your own by getting an organizer from any place that sells school supplies."
4,Convenient,"I was a little disappointed to find that it is not leather bound as Amazon claims; it is vinyl bound. What do you expect for $14 though. It is arranged conveniently, and allows easy carrying of the envelope system.All in all, it is a nice product. I recommend buying it."
2,Disappointed in envelopes themselves,"I really like Dave Ramsey. I have been using the envelopes for 9 months now and they are very helpful and keep us on track. However, the envelopes themselves are made of rather cheap paper that has torn at the flap every time. I have gone through two sets of these very quickly and I'm about to get into my third. If someone wants to use the envelopes to write money amounts on, then they will like the paper and the register-like columns on the front and back of the envelopes. However, if you are like me and you don't do this-- the envelopes fall apart! It would be more helpful to have a tyvec envelope system, and that would keep the bulk at about the same level.Thank you."
3,Dave Ramsey's Envelope System,"I found this item very helpful with my budget, although it is too large for a man to just tuck away in his pocket, so if your a man get used to carrying it. It has a great system to log your purchases to keep you true to your budget, although how does one put new envelopes into the binder when the old ones have ripped or had all the log space used up?"
2,Not what I expected,"I found this system to be mostly useless. It doesn't have a good retention system for the envelopes (just a pocket which is difficult to access) and the envelopes are not much better quality than a regular mailing envelope. I guess I expected this ""system"" to be well thought out and of a higher quality. It is, in my opinion, poorly designed and constructed. I used it for a couple of weeks and it is now occupies a spot in the local landfill. Waste of money as far as I am concerned."
3,Envelope system,This is a wonderful addition to Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover. I used this for awhile and found it helpful. For some one who needs a preplanned or prepared program this is great. I found it similar to the regular envelope system I had used in the past.
1,Don't spend the money,"I'm a fan of Dave Ramsey, but was disappointed in this item.It should have been included as a ""freebie"" with the purchase of one of his books. The envelope/checkbook holder appears to be vinyl, pretty cheap looking. There are not enough envelopes and the coin case is too small and such a thin material it's a waste.You can do the same set up with your existing checkbook and some plain envelopes. Save your money."
5,Slightly bulkier than standard envelope system.,"I bought this system to replace the standard system that we have worn out. After two years of barely fitting the envelopes that we needed to fit in the old one, and having to use a rubber band to keep it closed, we decided that the deal on Amazon for this one was worth it.-The deluxe executive version obviously holds more stuff, and comes with a notepad and pen. (along with all the stuff the standard version has).-The tri-fold arrangement makes it easier to keep all the loose envelopes we have in place.-The closure strap could use some velcro, or a snap, but it has a good enough friction fit for now.-I like the black finish. The flat brown color of the standard version was getting kind of drab feeling.-Last, the only real problem I have with this one is that it is too wide to fit in my back pocket. I found that when shopping, or doing errands, putting this in my back pocket (like the other one) would have been a nice hands free helper."
3,A huge help - ok quality,Im glad I bought this off amazon vs. Dave Ramsey's website since its quite a bit cheaper on here. I love that this wallet has helped me keep my spending and budget under control. I don't like the way it fastens close. It's not very secure and this concerns me due to the fact it's stuffed with cash. I also wish the envelopes were sturdier vs. the paper they are made of. After 2 months my envelope is already ripping. It is bulky but I can deal with that since it holds my checkbook and cards nicely. The pros of how this wallet has improved my financial life outweighs the cons of its construction.
4,Handy & Helpful,"It's not leather, but who cares? It looks nice, feels good and keeps me from overspending. I pay much more attention to how I allocate my money and have saved well over what I spent for the product in the few weeks I've had it. It's such a simple concept, but I feel like I've regained significant financial control already.Cons: Envelopes are spiral bound, so really can't be replaced adequately. I suppose new ones will just have to be loosely placed in this wallet. Also, the envelopes tear very easily. I have to keep taping the edges.Overall, I like it and am glad I bought it."
3,Helps with organization,"I am very pleased with the envelope system. It has made me aware of the amount of money that we as a family spend. It also is very beneficial in helping us stay on budget for the month. I recommend it. The reason for the three stars is that it is bulky and the check book dooes not fit snugly, other than that it is fine."
5,Great for those just getting started,This product is excellent for those of us in need of serious financial evaluation. It makes it easy and organized for those of us just getting started.
5,The Best Thing Wim has done!,"If you like Wim Mertens' ensemble work, you will LOVE this 3-CD set... it's simply the best work he has ever done. While the single disk ""Integer Valor"" is really a ""highlights"" album, the ""Integrale"" set is the complete thing. Complex, melodic, always interesting. Outstanding."
5,"Interesting, diverse and thouroughly enjoyable!",I have always thought that Mr. Watt is one of the best bassists around and this album solidified my judgement. It's amazing that he could write so many songs all on the same topic and have them all turn out so well. I am fully satisfied with this release and am awaiting his next project. (P.S. can't help but think that the picture of Mike inside resembles an older Captain Kirk)
5,Brilliant,"This album is simply amazing. It took me a few listens, but once I got into the story and understood the piece I couldn't stop listening to it. The amazing guitar work of Nels Cline really enhances this album as well. An excellent effort!"
2,Not really getting it.,"I picked this up because Nels Cline plays on it. The first listen probably won't lead to a second.It really is not that interesting,at all."
5,info about this rare gem!,"A US rock band led by Collins himself on guitar, the Allen Collins Band additionally comprised Jimmy Dougherty (vocals), Randall Hall (guitar), Barry Harwood (guitar), Billy Powell (b. 3 June 1952; keyboards), Leon Wilkeson (b. 2 April 1952; bass) and Derek Hess (drums). Powell and Wilkeson were both formerly members of Lynyrd Skynyrd. After the air crash in October 1977 that killed several members of that band they separated until deciding to work together again in 1983. Playing a strong selection of `southern boogie' material similar in style to that patented by the duo's parent band, they added brass accompaniment for their 1983 MCA Records release, Here There And Back. However, their debut album proved to be their sole recording."
1,untitled,This video was not as funny as I thought it would be. It had some moments but was not a good purchase.
5,OUT LOUD FUNNY...,HE IS SO FUNNY....I WENT TO SEE HIM IN PERSON AND FROM THAT NIGHT I WANTED ALL HIS DVDS....YOU CAN LOOK AT THEM OVER AND OVER AND ITS STILL FUNNY......
4,Mickey Gilley ....Again,Mickey Gilley is a true legend and will take his place anongst the stars such as Jerry Lee Lewis and other great country music stars this album has yet to get old .....it only gets better ...when all the dust settles ...Mickey Gilley will still be standing
4,Creative variations on basic patterns,"This book consists of 4 basic top patterns (inset, drop, raglan and kimono sleeves), pants and skirt patterns,and a couple of hats. The tops, which interest me the most, are boxy, with deep armholes. There are 24 collar variations, with instructions for ways to vary the styles. Some have complete instructions, others are suggestions. They show how to draft the patterns, but you can also buy the basic patterns full size from the publisher. I like big shirts, and attractive, interesting shirt patterns are very hard to come by. Definitely worth checking out!"
1,Stay away from this book!,"As a private tutor specializing in standardized testing, I am always looking for new material. In my 14 years of tutoring, I have never been disappointed enough to write a review - that is until now! This book is awful! It is riddled with mistakes and questions that are not even on the writing portion of the new SAT (or old SAT 2 writing test). Do yourself a favor and avoid this book."
1,Wrong Size!,"These exhaust end caps do not fit the advertised Vance & Hines systems (Longshots / Bigshots), as the diameter of these caps is larger. I now have a pair of very expensive paper weights!!"
1,Old Yucky spices,I had to throw away every spice that I purchased from this company. They were all old and horrible and some contained bugs.
3,A rather funny story,"It was the first time I read a play by Shakesperare. It was quite interesting to read it in this version, because you could compare the old English with the modern English. I have to say that the old English version was very difficult to understand and I was glad to have the modern English version beside.The book was sometimes funny to read, because the servants of the house do so many foolish pranks. The clown Feste made me laugh.The main plot is about Count Orsino's unreplied love to the rich lady Olivia. Viola, who thinks she has lost her twin brother on a ship, is disguised as a man and serves the count. She has to convince Viola of Orsino's love. But what else could happen than a mess? Viola falls in love with Orsino, and Olivia falls in love with Viola... After some funny troubles, Viola's brother comes back and Viola can show her love to Orsino, and Olivia comes together with Sebastian.I think it's a good story about love."
3,A story for breakfast,"I recommend this book to everybody who is in a mood to read an amusing, interesting and touching story. A very special aspect of course is Shakespeare's English, which is made intelligible with help of modern English. The story itself is played by all kinds of characters. It does not matter if you don't like one person, because there are still a lot of other characters with totally different characters."
4,Wonderful confusions,"Somehow it was difficult to understand, especially the jokes. And without the jokes the value of the play is lost. But still i think it is wonderfully funny comedy, and it was very interesting to read also the old Shakespeare English from time to time, even if we did not really understand it all the time.I liked the wonderful confusions among the main characters. And how full of life the characters are,so human. And it is amazing that a woman plays the main charactre in that 15th century!I would recommend it to everybody, because it is interesting, funny and humourus. It is also a good play for a class because you can easily replay parts of the play, which is somehow very funny."
3,A Fair Read,If you're looking for an easy read this book should work. I was a bit disappointed as I was expecting more vivid after life encounters and these seem to be rather strange.
2,Sold me a used product instead of new. Did not send original box or any documentation.,I think the title says it all. The seller sent me a used product without any original packaging or instructions.
4,Luther can't make/sing a bad song!,"Although I purchased this cd for ""I won't let you do this to me"", and was disappointed that only four new songs were on it, as usual the entire cd is awesome. Each song weaves you into the artist's lyrical romantic story and touches your soul."
4,Good Collection,"""When You Call on Me/Baby that's when I come Running the Cut that R.Kelly wrote&Produced on Luther is Nice.some of the other tracks are cool ""Best things in life' with Janet Jackson.I wouldn't put this Set up against His 80's Greatest Hits set but it has some really good stuff to peep&also Luther still has that Voice that Moves you.A Good Set that is tight."
3,"Great story, bad price","This is a wonderful story to read to your kids at night. The pictures are wonderful, though better in color. However, it seems like a lot just to get pictures. Get the free book instead."
5,perfect for wedding couple,I searched all over internet for these and this was the best deal for them. They are perfect for a wedding.
5,I'm Filling The Itch,This Song Rocks It Makes You Wanna Dance........ And U Can't Help To Sing It's Catchy Lyrics.1. The Itch2. Graduation (Friends Forever) (It's The Original Version No Talking)
4,"way to go, Jim!","We have seen Jim Caruso in person many times-not often enough, but this cd is great to fill in the blank times. We have one in each car. Fresh, fun and Caruso- love it!"
5,Get Ready to Be Delighted,"How many people do you know who are TRULY funny? And who can SING like a dream? Put on this CD and you will be entertained from start to finish! My husband and I listened to it for the first time in our car as we were driving in horrible rush hour traffic -- time sped by, even if WE didn't: we were laughing and listening, and we couldn't wait to hear what was coming next: we knew we'd be surprised and delighted. It is rare to feel a performer so in control of their material and their audience - but Caruso is one of those guys. Turn this CD on and sit back and get ready to have fun.--Amanda Green"
1,This Caruso can't really sing,"OK, he's no Enrico Caruso, or anywhere close. I realize this CD is a recording of his live show, so maybe you had to be there to really enjoy it. Just listening to the CD, I found him annoying, tiresome and trying too hard to be ''hip.'' For a musical-comedy CD, Caruso's not very musical or very comical."
1,Pictured product not shipped,"The picture clearly shows an inline dripper, what was actually sent was an online dripper, the difference being that only one side is barbed and cannot be used to string a line with 1/4"" dripper tube. Buyer beware! I took the 2 packages I received to my local hardware store and fortunately they sell the same brand and I was able to exchange them for the ones pictured."
2,too hard to get on and off,"having bad shoulders and arms, this is too difficult to get the velcro closures off."
2,Too expensive for a single weight,"Though this item was exactly what I was looking for (the same that I used in Physical Therapy), the high price of $7.99 + $7.90 shipping was too much for just a single weight. I wrongly assumed I was purchasing a pair."
2,Made with cheap synthetic plastic; save shipping costs and buy local.,The product I purchased was made of inferior quality synthetic plastic material which can easily be punctured and the sand would spill all over. Save your money on shipping costs (almost as much returning it as it would to buy it) and shop your local store.
4,Very Handy Reference,This book was a great reference of where to go and where not to go. We were able to plan our whole trip using the book and had a great time. Unfortunately some of the places mentioned for dinner are still closed due to the last hurricane that really did some damage there. If you are traveling make sure you check the websites or with your hotel when you get there before you take a drive out!
4,Hell's not all THAT bad !,"Very helpful guide on our recent visit, but THREE warnings that Hell is not worth the trip? It wasn't THAT bad, at least it's FREE, compared with $50 or $75 for the Turtle Farm."
3,GREAT FOR GETTING PUMPED UP!!!! A SUMMER CLASSIC!,"THIS IS A GREAT CD AND IS GREAT FOR WORKOUT AND FOR WARMING UP TO PLAY YOUR OWN VOLLEYBALL MATCH. GREAT SOUND, GOOD QUALITY, CLASSIC MOTIVATIONAL CD."
1,Nerven & Schlaftee,Not able to review product. Product was ordered by me to be delivered to an address other than mine as a gift.
5,"Welcome Back, Harold...It's Been A While!","What a great idea! The books you love from your childhood are here, in DVD format for you to share with your child (or classroom). We use these in our home as pre-bedtime videos on occasion. Our favorite is the ""Harold"" DVD. You could look these titles up on your own for a full video listing, but I thought I'd help out and make your life a little bit easier. Included titles are as follows:""Harold and the Purple Crayon"": Harold and the Purple Crayon, A Picture for Harold's Room, Harold's Fairy Tale, The Mysterious Tadpole, Drummer Hoff, Smile for Auntie""Corduroy"": Corduroy, Yo! Yes?, Here Comes the Cat, The Rainbabies""The Snowy Day"": The Snowy Day, Whistle for Willie, Peter's Chair, Pet Show!, A Letter to Amy, The Trip, Apt. 3 (Also included in this DVD is ""Getting to Know Ezra Jack Keats"")Hope this helps! Sound quality and story flow is great. My 2-year-old just loves these!"
1,More lame music...,"This si lame anynomus swing. You can't dance to it cause it has no tempo and it is boring, it will put you to sleep, but I'd rather take a sleeping pill anyday that hear this. A cd that should naver have been released, and can't this band play in key? A horrible cd."
4,solutions found elsewhere...carrying on the conversation,"I quote another reviewer when I found myself thinking along the same lines about the book: ""The book is part of a useful discussion, but the context and knowledge to engage in it does not seem to be present at this time. Unfortunate.""I think Scott has identified the issue, though fails to really have anything constructive to say about solutions? To continue this useful discussion of how to effectively put 'metis' into the state is the issue it seems to me. On these lines, I would recommend reading Scott's book followed by _Toward a Bioregional State_ (2005) as the latter may humbly provide some useful tools of constitutional engineering ""to bring the metis back in,"" to coin a phrase, as a means of checking against the undue governmentality from a distance that is intentionally without local input--as Scott's examples so well describe are connected with forms of social and environmental degradation."
3,"Okay Cushion, better if you're a tall person, not for petites","I just received this cushio yesterday. It's decent material, the lumbar part is adjustable via two ""velcro"" stickys pads. Basically you pull out the part and stick it elsewhere on the cushion where it fits you best. I would say that the contour of the cushion didn't fit my back no matter where i put the lumbar pad (including removing it completely). It feels a little odd, and it didn't increase or decrease the my sitting comfort label. I think this is mainly because I am a petite at 5 feet 1 inch...my back is of course not as ""tall"" as the average american adult. The overall shape/contour of the cushio just didn't feel right on my back."
2,Lumbar Support Sort-of,"Nice idea for all of us office workers, but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support. Furthermore, the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support. I am looking for something else."
3,A painful tale of desparation in Russia.,Vladimir Zhirinovsky tells a chilling tale of life in Russia. The book begins with his painful and anti-social childhood. Vladimir overcame his past and began his carreer in politics. The book discusses this three-time presidential candidate's plans for the Post-Soviet nation of Russia. There is only one drawback to this book: it seems as though something was lost in translation. Th sentences are somewhat choppy and the vocabulary is poorly chosen.
5,Great,"This is a good comeback, from the release of ""Victory"", this is another solid relase. They brought back the collabs with Twista, which always makes for good music when those 2 get together and make music. With songs like ""Sex Appeal"", ""Diamenz"" and ""Touchdown"", this cd is bangin. If you're Do or Die fan you must get this for you collection, or if you're a rap fan pic this up, you'll like it."
2,Not As Good As TheFirst By Far,"I have to say that I am very disappointed with the 2nd album from Jump5. It sounds like their voices were all computerized...in every song!! The only good song is the first one, ""All I Can Do."" Also you get 3 remixes of songs that are really stupid. They don't even have proper remix names. It's just 'remix'. they vcouldn't record 3 extra songs for the album...i was somewhat disappointed. Perhaps one day you'll see my copy on ebay...you never know..."
1,They are OLDIES!,"They are soo over! They think they are still pop stars,YEAH RIGHT!Most songs suck and they have REALLY BAD MUSIC VIDEOS!If the boys were out and the girls then got a choreographer, they may just have another chance(the girls)(...)"
1,Misleading,"The write-up finally indicates the PL50 turntable is included. Earlier it was the PL120. However, the technical description still includes the PL120 information. The PL50 does not have an S shaped arm, anti-skid, or balance control. It also does not operate at 78 rpm. Don't order this from the description. You will be very disappointed. Amazon doesn't help much either. They are more concerned about protecting themselves than fixing the problem."
1,the worst piece of crap ever,This movie is the biggest headache known to man kind. It is a bunch of people who hate themselves sitting around yelling at each with no real horror moments. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!!!!!!
3,Weird.,"I'm not exactly sure what to think about this cd. This album being my first time to ever hear Autechre's music, I was kind of disappointed.I've never met a Nothing Records artist/band that i didn't love, until now. This stuff is PRETTY good, just nothing fantastic that you'd expect from this label. A lot of it is just looped electronics with a very annoying treble basskick sample that kind of hurts your ears...The highlight track of this album is definitely ""Blifil"", as it's a lot more interesting (and more danceable) than the rest of the cd... fast-paced electronic coolness with freaky samples.Over-all this isn't bad music, but it really isn't going to be one of my favorite cd's... hopefully their next release will have a bit more to it."
3,good,"but not essential. Odds are you'll only want this if you're a die hard AE fan. The 4 tracks, while good, lack the fine tuning and production that the studio albums have. Of course this is because its a live recording. Great for what it is, but lacks the OOMFH the albums have."
1,TWO DEAD HP SDRAM MEMORY,"I purchased two USED ((HP 373029-051 1GB PC3200 400MHZ ECC DDR SDRAM DIMM GENUINE HP MEMORY))and installed them on my HP desktop and both were rejected due to short/dead and then tried with couple other PCS and reveived the same results.I did not return the items because postage cost compare to item cost.Usually when I do purchase an item online and results like this being disappointed, low rate will be given to main and sub seller."
4,Not bad. It's ok.,"Good material. My Kodak DC3200 does not fit on it very well, but I can put some extra batteries and additional compact flash cards every well on it. If you think to use it on filmed cameras, extra films won't fit on the little bag that it has."
3,NOT for a DSLR,"I got this as part of a kit with aNikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lensand it seemed fine. Then I decided to add aNikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Camerasto my kit.The camera fits nicely in the bag with the 70-300mm, but there's nowhere to put a second lens. I ended up using the Velcro dividers to cover the camera in the bottom of the bag and put my 18-55mm on top. It just kind of rolls around the bag now. :(Not a bad bag for somebody with a P&S; camera or even a small camcorder, but definitely not for somebody who wants to tote around a couple extra lenses and other misc stuff."
5,"THIS MOVIE WASN'T WASTING MY TIME, IT WAS COOLIN'","If you have not seen this movie your missing out. Vanilla Ice is da man and everybody should know it. The movie is extremely funny and will keep you laughing the whole way through. I have rented this movie so many times from the same video store because it is so hard to find. Right now I am trying to find a copy of it,but I'm not going to pay $93 for it. If you get the chance to watch it I would highly recommend it. Even if you don't like Vanilla Ice or the movie, it will have you dying laughing and wanting to watch it again. WORD TO UR MUTHA! I'M OUT!"
5,1990's art at its best,"Incredible. Cool As Ice is an experience, one filled with wonderful art and sound. This film is awesome. It is a lens that peers into a very unique part of American history. There is nothing here for Vanilla Ice to be embarressed about. This film has been reborn, becoming something far greater and more powerful than it was intended to be."
3,"Cheesy, but fun","Vanilla Ice is not that bad an actor, considering he isn't an actor. I think he was great with his love scenes, more believable than Eminem in 8 Mile, and I love 8 Mile. This movie's plot was dumb. If Rob wasn't in this movie, I know I wouldn't have watched it."
2,Not Happy!,"I received my movie with in days of ordering so I was happy about that. Unfortunetely, half the movie does not work. I can see a finger print on the disk from when it was burned. I did not save the receipt (my fault) so I can't return it."
5,I like this movie but...,"why does everyone that reviews this movie think he is a rap star? The movie was funny and stupid. I enjoyed it, but face it people, you can't rap!"
5,"We are all heros and all zeros, at once and always","We mock that which we do not understand. Nearly 15 years have passed since this seminal 1991 work exploring post-Cold War realpolitik was released to almost universal critical acclaim, though it fared poorly outside of art-house theaters in the most cosmpolitan of Europe's capital cities. While the binary, us-or-them thinking of the protagnoist, the nearly Shakespearean Mr. Ice, was probably lost on larger audiences, those of us struggling with the fall of the Berlin Wall and our own divided loyalities sympathized with the film's attractive heroine and her existential dilemma: Drop the zero? Get with the hero? Which is which, and whom is whom?One other comment: While the out-of-print VHS version of this film is perfectly adequate for the casual viewer, I'd highly recommend the superior transfer of the Bratslavian-import DVD, which includes among its bonus features a lengthy roundtable discussion of the film by Henry Kissinger, James Baker and N.W.A."
1,An example of everything that went wrong in america,"Possibly the worst film ever staring rap ""artist"". Bannal in all aspect, espacilly ices acting. All the writing is terriable as well is the films musical score and visual style. Avoid it please."
5,Yo! VIP Lets kick it!,Drop those zeros and get with the hero! Vanilla Ice is the best in the universe!
3,Cool as Ice: Vanilla Ice Strikes Back,"Seriously though...Vanilla Ice has the acting skills of a piece of driftwood.Oh man, this movie is terrible. It's so terrible that I found myself cracking up the majority of the time. It's so mind-numbingly bad that I actually kinda liked watching it. But I just couldn't bring myself to give this crapfest a four or five star rating, no matter how many times I laughed at it. It's basically Vanilla Ice trying to be a neon-clad James Dean with fantastic pickup lines such as, ""Drop that zero and get with a hero."" Do I really need to say anything about that one? Didn't think so.My favorite scene of the movie would probably be the one where he magically jumps his motorcycle over a fence without a ramp. Who needs physics? Not Ice.So if you're bored (and preferably drunk and/or high), pop this cheesefest in your old VCR."
1,One Star Is Like a Compliment to THIS,"Some people describe Vanilla Ice as a rapper who can't act. Although it's true, he is an absolutely horrible actor, I think of him more as a rapper who can't rap. Vanilla Ice has NO TALENT. I can't believe how many good reviews this is getting! And ""Drop that zero, get with the hero?"" That line is a joke. Bottom line, U Can't Watch This (Courtesy of MC Hammer, the OTHER untalented one-hit-wonder). If you want a good film that's sole purpose is to exploit the success of a musician, watch ""Hard Day's Night,"" or ""Help!"""
1,SO BAD IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHITEZPLOITATION,This flick was worse than BODYROCK.Lorenzo Lamas' breakdance flick
5,An incredible motion picture...,"What can I say about Cool As Ice that hasnt already been said?Probably nothing. Still. I recently received a foriegn DVD release of the film and was THRILLED.From the action (Ice makes a jump on his bike so bad-a$$ that it makes a horse freak out!) to the dialogue (""Well, I'll see you.."" ""Yer seein' me NOW.""), this is a WONDERFUL motion picture.See, I believe in a thing called a Happy Accident. Movies that are SO INCREDIBLY BAD that they actually end up being wonderful.There are TONS of bad movies, but very few Happy Accidents. Road House was one. Showgirls was another. Wild Things was the most recent.But Cool as Ice? BEST. HAPPY. ACCIDENT. EVER.What made it so great was that you could tell it wasnt MEANT to be bad. Someone actually thought they were writing a good movie!!!All in all... if you can find an old video store that has this? Rent it. If you have ANY type of sense of humor, you will NOT regret it."
5,92.99 isnt enough $$ for vanilla's performance.,"I remember seing this movie in the movie theatres on opening weekend back in 1991. I walked out of the theatres with a new perception of life. I was truly a changed man. Vanilla's award winning dialogue and evil kenevil bike riding was commended throughout my family. I immediately told my mother that I must have this movie as my christmas present that year. My mom must have forgotten and so did I. I just purchased the movie on amazon.com for 92.99 and thought that I might buy 4 or 5 more for this christmas as presents. But dont be fooled, this movie must have cost atleast $10 million to make, so 92.99 is a VERY considerable price.....Yup yup...."
5,I bought two copies!,"And $200 later, I'm still a richer man for having done it! Frankly, I was only prepared to spend $75 for one copy of this epochal document, but since that ""Down By Law"" jacket never turned up on eBay like I hoped, I had a little extra left in my savings to spend. Now in case my main copy of ""Cool As Ice"" ever wears out or is stolen, I have an extra! Yup yup, this is undoubtedly sweet! Thank you, Amazon!"
4,International-Style Ballrooom Dancing,"This is a pretty good book for anyone who's currently taking lessons in International-style dancing. It goes through all 10 dances used in International Rhythm and Smooth competition. The author presents about 12 or more variations in each dance. There are foot diagrams for about half the variations. He details the footwork (written), contrary body movement, timing, sway and amount of turn. All of the photos are of competitors at a dance event so they're not helpful if you're trying to learn how any figure looks. I don't think it's a book to buy if you're starting to learn how to dance but if you're already taking lessons, it's a good book to reinforce what you're learning. American-style is not covered at all."
4,A very good reference,"This text is a very good reference for International style dancing. It is very complete and conforms fairly well to the syllabus. As stated by other reviewers, if you're a beginner its probably too much, but if you have a good teacher nearby to help explain some of the ambiguities you can learn a lot on your own from it. Definitely not a book that you can just pick up and start dancing, it requires some intellectual effort to digest, but once you've done that you'll have a clear and systematic conceptualization and schema for dancing that few teachers can impart. My only major complaint: an excess of glossy pictures from dancing competitions. This book is really most helpful for the standard dances (which is OK with me since that's my style, not latin.)"
4,Good price for a dance book,"One of the better books on dancing and descriptions of figures.Assumes you know something about dancing and has many hint and reminders for the experenced dancer.Now if they would just re-publish Henry Jacques masterpiece,instructors and dancers would really benefit with a dance book."
2,Only for the VERY EXPERIENCED dancer,"I've been ballroom dancing for quite a while, and I bought this book in order to learn some more dance steps over and beyond the basics. I found the descriptions and diagrams IMPOSSIBLE to understand, and the steps I could figure out ended up being out of place among the steps that I usually dance. I think this book is only good if you're a dance teacher who is used to reading steps in a certain format and can translate them into motion. If you're a beginner, this book will do you NO GOOD!"
4,The Rich Get Richer,MODERN BALLROOM DANCING has been valuable to me in improving my skills in those dances with which I was already familiar. The usefulness seemed to have been in direct proportion to what I knew before reading the book. It has not been very helpful in learning new dances.The text includes several dazzling photos of competitive dancers in action.
3,Ballroom Dancing Steps You Need,Modern Ballroom Dancing: All the Steps You Need to Get You Dancing is an accurate title for a great little book. A dancer who studies and practices what this offers will indeed be dancing soon. It is good for steps but needs follow up with a coach for body positioning to help make the dancing more comfortable.
5,Brilliant,"If you know Shawn Lane's work, this is a must own recording. If you are new, this is a great sampler of Shawn's style and passion. ""The Way it has to be"" is a song I can listen to again and again and never get tired of. It's just beautiful. We were blessed to have such a wonderful musician on this Earth, even if for such a short time."
5,Very Good,A must have for all game soundtrack collectors. (Does not have Mad World on the CD though...)
4,"4.5... Propulsive, kinetic...","and extremely heavy on atmosphere. There are identifiable themes but they are more often than not subsumed by atmospheric washes and zings. An extremely well engineered, mixed and mastered album. I was also very surprised by the minimal use of electronic percussive elements used, the composers/engineers appearing to opt for sampling acoustic elements and treating them to provide the percussive tones. Very reminiscent of the tenser moments in Goldsmith's ""Aliens"" or even Silverstri's ""Predator"" soundtrack. If A GoW movie ever gets made I'd like to see Riepl get the nod as composer, and maybe he could concentrate on a few more identifiably heroic sounding themes (as no doubt he would be required to do so as films are entirely different beasts than games)."
4,"good, but missing major track!!","The music is great, but i could get past the gaping hole in this sound track! where is the cole train rap from the credits of the game??? i enjoy listening to the soundtrack, but for not having that one song, i will dock it a whole star. if that song is not that important to you, consider this a 5 star review. but be warned: i bought this cd knowing that track wasnt on it, but the feeling that it should have been has grown on me to the point where i feel the album is incomplete."
2,No good without the game,"I'm honestly a bit conflicted when rating this soundtrack. On the one hand, it goes really well with the action in the game, and in fact adds to the experience 3 fold while playing. On the other hand, while I do think that the music was done well, I don't think its worth listening to at your leisure. This is a straight action packed, shoot-em-up type game with very little pause in between. As such, there is a lot of action based music on here. As a matter a fact, probably all but 2 or 3 tracks are like that. While this is not exactly a bad thing, for those who are like myself, who prefer a little more variety in a score, this can get very tired very quickly. I just happened to have a friend who has it so i burned a copy for myself, and boy I'm glad I didn't pay for this cuz I'd have been mad. Then again, this is just my opinion. I'm not denouncing the music in general, I just wouldn't wanna hear it outside the game."
4,Works as advertised,Not much to say other than it works the way it is supposed to. Fairly simple product that works the way it is supposed to.
2,I was disappointed,"If I had seen this in a bookstore, I would have passed it up. The book is flimsy and the bear is very small. The diaper pants for the bear are very tiny and difficult to put on, so my little boy doesn't really get any benefit from them. I don't care for the format of having parent notes on the same page as the story. In all, very disappointing."
3,Cute Book and Doll,"I bought this book for my 2 1/2 yr. old daughter. The book does explain to the child the process of learning pottying; however, the book explains that boys stand up to urinate and girls sit down. I thought that was too much information at this point in time. My daughter never plays with the doll."
1,German scholarship at its worst,"Beginning with a rejection that the Bible is inspired, this extremely liberal view proposes ""Higher Criticism"" be exalted above ancient texts. The arrogance of this position is astonishing!"
1,Worst RAID Card Ever,"This is the WORST RAID card I have ever purchased. It drops drives left and right. Adaptec has a firmware update, but you have to completely rebuild the arrays to install it! This card is VERY unreliable. I waited on hold, never speaking to a single soul, for over an hour at Adaptec's support line. I finally just gave up.I'm not sure what has happened to Adaptec, but it isn't good in my opinion."
3,Good book.,"This book was pretty good. I enjoyed reading the Pepper books. It is a bit hard to follow in some places, but otherwise it's ok."
5,Impressive debut album,"""A beginning"" is the impressive debut effort by composer and pianist rada. The artist obviously has a strong classical background, as the pieces on this album show a complexity of melody and counterpoint that should satisfy even harsh critics of new age music; ""la tempesta"" in particular has a strong and beautiful classical air. However, the music on this album also possesses the great strengths of the new age genre: pleasing melodies that are gentle yet also strong enough to leave you humming them long after the album is done. The album is primarily piano solo; on the few occasions strings or other instrumentation are added in, it is not intrusive but rather enhances the music. There is not a single piece I didn't like on this album, but if forced to choose, I'd say my favorites were ""snowfall"" (a delightful and catchy waltz); ""far away places"" (another waltz, this time with a slightly sad air); and ""a country lullaby."""
3,Decent collection - could have been better,"About half of these tracks are good. As for the other half, they could have chosen a lot better selections on the CD. I listen to JB&B on a regular basis. They have done better material than the 'bad half' of this CD. I still don't regret buying it."
1,Product would not work with mt PC,I installed it on a PC I have had for 4 years which does not have usb 2.0 on the mobo. Once I installed it several devices previously working malfunctioned. I reinstalled several times and always the same problems. Uninstalled and all went back to normal so I sent it back for a refund. My advise is get a name brand and pay the extra cash for dependability.
1,Didn't work,I tried to replace a USB 1 port with this. It wasnt' picked up by XP so I installed the driver sent with it. It just kept locking up my machine so I reinstalled the USB 1 and just live with the speed. A wast of 20 bucks. First product I've gotten through Amazon that was worth less. Still love Amazon.
3,No Windows 7 Support Yet,"Just purchased this card for my new Windows 7 desktop, but discovered they have no Windows 7 drivers. Tech support was very nice about it, but couldn't promise when drivers would be available. They said certainly more than 1 month from today (26 Jan 2010). So, no choice but to return the card. Gave them 3 stars for good tech support response. Not really sure how the card would have performed."
5,Great PCI Card!,"Arrived on time, and it looked pretty good to me. Easy to install, just popped it into an empty PCI slot in my desktop PC. Windows automatically recognized it after I rebooted, I didn't even need to use the CD it was packaged with. It dramatically upped the speeds of my USB transfers from my previous USB 1.1. I would definitely recommend it!"
1,Not Funny,"There are manny clean and dirty black comics. Unfortunately, none of them were here.I'm funnier than all of them. See my Google Blog: mrmitch06/ I couldn't play Amazon. So I was beat. They were taking up room. So I sent them to my brother im Oregon. I hope he enjoys them. As as educator I give them a D. Save your $. Do not rent or buy this. Viewers should be paid to endure it."
1,ANGRY,I still have not received this item! I order this DVD a month ago as a Christmas gift...so I am sure you know I am very dissatisfied!!
5,Don't like modern music? You haven't heard THIS!,"Everyone arguing that recent modern music took a wrong track with Schonberg and his followers needs to hear what happens when serialism goes to Italy, via Dallapiccola. I call him the 12-tone Puccini. What a vibrant, passionate, accessible composer who at the same time never sacrifices or panders.z Why isn't this wonderful opera on all the world's stages? The opening line of the mother is indelible, the choral interludes stunning, the ""fratello"" motif both musically haunting and politically charged. The Songs of the Imprisoned is an amazingly beautiful choral work and utilizes the Dies Irae in a most moving fashion. Great instrumental sounds from an unusual instrumentation. Check out his Sappho Fragments also. The conducting and playing are superb, and the engineering is fine."
1,Wrong CD,I ordered Lilat Time Franz Lehar but the people who sent this CD album conived to sell me an unwated Cd The Lilac Time in stead of the one that I asked and paid for..I lodged an e-mail complaint with Amazon some weeks ago but it appears they never look at their e-mail complaints.The CD The Lilac Time to my mind is a useless bit of musical trash.I give it no stars but the site will not let me do this. Also no stars for Amazon
3,nice,"This is cute but like the other cinderella items in the line, it is made VERY cheaply. The plastic is just begging to be snapped. I wish they would have put holes in the tray where everything is supposed to be placed. When my 4 year old tries to wheel her tea set around everything falls on its side and ""spills"" she gets very upset over this."
2,"Broken wheel, limited fun","My two year old received this (well the Beauty and the Beast version) tea cart for Christmas last year. By New Year's, one of the wheels had fallen off, and could not be repaired. The saving aspect is that the tea cart top detaches for use as a tray, so we are able to get some use out of the toy even though the cart itself broke quickly."
5,Stylish Messenger Bag...,"The Gold color makes this bag looks great! It is better then the blue and red color. I take it with my Ideapad Y550(15.4 inchscreen) everywhere. It is very easy to put the power cord in one side water bottle pocket and put the remote mouse, digital camera charger and my 34G USB Drive in the other side water bottle pocket."
4,"Nice bag, easy to organize","I like this. It's attractive and has great pockets and setup for organizing. It's not 5 stars because the handle on top is placed oddly where it's not comfortable to use. Not the product's fault, but I'd love it if it was just a little smaller. I bought it for airtravel and it will be a little tough to fit under the seat for take-off and landing. A few inches smaller and it could still hold everything and be just a little more convenient for what I wanted."
3,Disappointed,Cart operated good but the wheels are too small causing it to stop in grass or even a small amount of dirt.
3,NOT A BAD BUY,"After a 2 month waiting period, my son is able to enjoy the go-cart. its a pretty neat toy for kids, What i dislike is the braking pad wheres out to fast and its to low to the ground, my son gets mad when the braking mechansim hits the floor. but besides that it was an easy installation and my son loves it..."
4,really pleased with it.,"This goes pretty fast, so keep an eye on your youngsters driving it. But it is heavy and sturdy. Have charged it a few times, no problems there. I weigh 165 lbs and it drives me around pretty good as well."
1,What a waste of money,I took a loss on this one. I bought two for both of my sons for Christmas and the both stopped working in less than six months. The factory warranty is no good. They are both sitting in my garage collecting dust. Do not but without purchasing additional warranty.
2,broken in one week?!?! :(,"Though my nine year old was thrilled when this item showed up 4 days ahead of schedule (guess it helps to live near a distribution center), he is now extremely disappointed in the fact that he has had the go-kart for less than a week and the chain has already broken on it...and that you can not find a replacement chain or parts ANYWHERE local?!? He did not ride the kart excessively, nor was he rough on it at all. Simply was driving down the cul de sac and it quite moving....find out the chain has come off, and the master link is missing. We have been to numerous places looking for a chain piece this size to fix it, but to no avail. Next step is to contact RAZOR and hope that they can get us what we need.VERY DISAPPOINTED>"
2,Problems with the Razor go kart,"I ordered this for my 13 year old for Christmas last year. He didn't even get to ride it until the spring. two months after being able to ride it the throttle broke. because razor only has a 90 warranty they gave me hassle sending the part. not even 2 months after that the chain broke. I had to replace that twice. Now the go cart won't go more than maybe 2 mph. So, out of less than 12 months my son has been able to enjoy this extremely expensive gift, a total of maybe 4 months in between fixes. I would not recommend buying a razor product. So far we own 3, and 2 of those 3 razors have lasted less than 12 months!!!"
4,Perfect Gift!,"I bought this gift for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it, and it was so simple to put together! They are right when they say 95% put together from the box! She's able to get up our hilly street and driveway with no problem. It has some great speed. I even took it for a ride, although I'm over the recommend weight limit and it went up a hill just fine! I would certainly recommend this product!"
5,Great toy for the kids,"I bought this item 4 weeks ago for my 11 year old, and he loves it, all his friends ride it ranging from 80lbs to 125lbs and they get good speed out of it. rated at 12 mph and it seems to do that. I rode it 210lbs, and it's slower but still no problem.it looks really small when you get it out of the box, but once you put your feet on the front rail, it's not that small. Its very low to the ground, so you have to have the flag on. but you can't turn it over, so much safer than the ATV's. i bought a second one for our 6 year old last week, and it works great again."
5,Razor Ground Force Rules !,"This is a great toy kart for kids ! We found a vacant parking garage and my son can drive as long as he wants. It's last about one hour per charge , but, he usually tires out before that.The kart is good for training kids for future gas kart racing. Is fast enough for them to experience the fun of speed, but not too fast that they can get hurt badly. There seemd to be two types out there though. One is belt driven one is chain. I'm not sure but I think the chain driven one is better. The belt one may have been breaking too many belts so they went to a chian setup...Not sure though, the reason for the two types."
2,Razor Ground Force Electric Go-Kart,"I am sad to say that I am not very happy with this item. It is built well and looks nice, but it will not hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. My son was so happy to get the go-cart on Christmas morning...only to be disappointed every time he tries to take it for a ride. We have the razor pocket rocket for our older son and it is wonderful. The charge lasts a few hours - a much better buy!!!"
3,"My kids love it, but minor problems","We bought 2 for our boys. They love them, but we've had some minor problems. They both occurred within 1 to 2 days after using them. The first was a battery that does not seem to be holding its charge. He would ride it for 5 min. and the gokart would slow down and need to be recharged. The second problem was with the other gokart. On the second day, the chain (which drives the belt), broke and fell off. The company Razor was really good about sending a replacement battery and chain, however it took about 3 weeks to receive the chain which means my son was without his gokart during this time! Hopefully this is the end to our problems."
4,Go Kart-ing,"I got this for my son last Christmas. He's really enjoyed it. It goes up hills just fine and isn't so fast that it's scary. He's 7, 5 feet tall and 100 lbs and it works well for him. This does work best of flat paved land. Great ride on toy for the child thats now too big for the classic peg perego type plastic battery ride on cars/motorcycles. We've had no problems with this item."
1,Waste of $$$$$$!,"We bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas. He rode it Christmas morning and we left town that day for NY. He rode it when we returned on the 31st. Rode it up the curb of our driveway and the chain broke! Now i have to pay to have it fixed!!! Not designed very well, there is no cover over chain and it is low to ground."
4,Lot's of Fun!,I ordered this for my 9 year old for Christmas. It came mostly put together and was easy to set up. My son has had so much fun the past few days riding this. The downside is that it takes 12 hours to fully charge the battery.
2,No longer working after 4 Months,Disappointed ..My 7 yr old rode it on the sidewalk only. then suddenly stopped working. We think maybe a fuse or something. Have no idea about these things. Just in our gargage taking up space..
4,Bad turning radius,My boys (ages 7 and 9)love this go-kart. We have had it about a month and they ride it all the time. My only complaint is the turning radius. They can barely turn around in the road. Most of the time they have to get off and manually pick the front end of the go-kart up and move it.
3,Kids electric go cart,"Worked fine for a while. Issues with steering wheel attachment, steering components, and now its quit working completely. I don't know if its the battery, charger, power switch or what."
1,disappointed,"We were so disappointed with this product. The first order was received very timely, however it was inoperable, thanks to a broken module when it arrived. Quickly replaced, only to be a disppointement on grass and surges of power on concrete. Overall.....a flop."
2,Quit after 4 weeks,Bought Kart for 8yr old daughter. She loves it. Its fun to ride however it quit after 4 weeks. It appears the Electronic Control Module has failed. Its not the circuit breaker.
4,fun but a few design issues,"My son loves this cart which he's had since yesterday. I guess that is what's important. So far it looks sturdy, which it should be for the $$$ price. The brakes are good, the ride seems stable, and the top speed is probably around 10 mph carrying a 10 year old. However, a few design issues are immediately apparent:1) The wheels are tiny, perhaps 4.5 inches in diameter. So the ride is quite rough on our paver driveway. Would be much better on pavement.2) The car is extremely low and would be impossible for a car to see from certain angles or at dusk. The safety flag is short and dark colored and really doesn't improve things. We changed the flag to a much longer orange one and put forward and backwards lights on my son's helmet to help visibility.3) The turn radius is gigantic. He can barely make a U turn in our wide driveway. My minivan has a better turn radius. This would not work in a backyard patio area.Other than that, so far so good. The red color is pretty!"
4,Kids Love It - Worth the Money,"My son got this for his 8th birthday, and he loves it! Assembly was a snap, since almost everything was already put together. The manual (as others have said) is a joke - they've changed the design of the cart since the manual was written, and the updates aren't in the printout (or on the web site). There's conflicting info about how to charge the cart too - but I figure it should just be treated like any other rechargeable battery. You'll need a large smooth paved area for this cart - it doesn't work too well on uneven or rough pavement, and though it can go through packed gravel, I don't think it's a good idea. So far it's been quite durable, keeps a charge for a reasonable amount of play - we feel it was a good purchase and well worth the money."
4,Great go-kart for young children,"We puchased this Go-Kart about 2 1/2 years ago and our daughter still uses it today. She was 7 when we got it for her. It is fast enough but not to fast that she can not handle it. Her friends all want to ride it when they come over to play. We did have to replace the batteries about 1 year after we purchased it, but I think you have to expect that with any battery powered item like this. It will only work on hard surfaces because of the small tire size, so we have also purchased the electric 4 wheeler that is great for in the yard. You just have to remember to plug them in after each use so the batteries last longer."
3,Fun for a short time,"We noticed when we got this gokart that the tires were not in very good alignment. There was no way to align the tires. The tires don't have a lot of tread on them and now they are really worn after just a few months. Now our Razor gokart won't turn at all when my son rides it. Even though he's turning the steering wheel, it continues to go straight. It's not able to make corners at all and sits in our garage after just a couple of months of play.The charger has been fine for us. No problems with the battery. They recalled all the older models of this gokart, but seemed to have gotten all the bugs fixed when we bought ours in May 2005. We ran the battery down and charged it each time we used it. The tires though keep us from using it. Proper alignment and replacements would probably make it a favorite toy again.It was a great toy for a little while."
3,NOT USUABLE IN THE YARD,"I bought this for my grandson to ride in the yard, I would never allow him in the streets with a motorized vehicle. Surprise, it does not run on grass, must have a hard surface. This was not stated in the product info.It says meant for controlled environment not for the street. My driveway is not big enough for him to turn in although it is a double drive, the kart has poor turning ability. So I am disappointed. If any one has solutions to help it run in the grass let me know!!!"
4,great christmas gift,got this for my then 8 year old for christmas. she loves it and uses it often. its not too fast so its pretty safe. i believe it goes up to 12mph
5,Razor go kart great product,"Bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. Easy assembly and it had a factory charge in the battery so he was able to drive it first thing on Christmas morning. My 4 year old is now driving it, very easy and safe to drive. Also I am impressed with the long battery life and the high quality of the frame. Great gift, highly recommend buying this go kart."
2,GO GO RAZOR,"I bought this for my son and he enjoys it greatly, unfortunately, it stopped working after 6 months and I don't know where to send it to get it fixed. It doesn't take it's charge anymore so I am wondering if I need to get a new motor after 6 months for his go kart. This was great when it worked, but it didn't work for long."
1,Poor quality kart!,Please do not waste your money on any Razor items. The batteries will not work for long [...].
2,"Not as good as described, so DISAPPOINTED!!!","I just got it yesterday, the right side of seat is broken after I opened the package, the seat belt is broken too after 3 minutes drive, my 7-year-old got injured badly. (It is really fast, more than 15 mph depends on driver weight) I wrote to Amazon, Customer Service ordered another one for, but he didn't let me know, they were forcing me to buy another one... It's ridiculous!!! Amazon made me so disappointed by poor customer service! and Amazon doesn't want to take any responsibility.The product seems sturdy, since it goes really fast, so the driver must wear seat belt when driving, but the included seat belt has very poor quality, not worth the money AT ALL!.."
1,Groundforce Disaster - lousy customer service,"I buy the Groundforce Electric Go Kart and less than 1 hour out of the box the rear axle breaks!! Unbelievable. So I call customer service. They request I fax in my UPC/proof of purchase and they will send me a new axle. Instead, they (somebody named Phil) send me two rear wheels. I call again, talk to another service rep., re-fax my documentation and after a week-and you're not going to believe this-they send me an electrical kit for for one of their scooters. So I call again. This time they are not receiving any audio on their customer service lines so I'm shouting into the phone (three times I tried) and they hang up on me after 10 seconds or so...each time! Avoid these guys like the plague. They are the worst company I have ever done or at least tried to do business with...they do not deserve your business."
1,Birthday disappointment,"We purchased it for my son's birthday and charged the battery the night before his birthday so that he would be able to race on his big day. However, he was only able to use it for literally FOUR minutes before it would slow to a snail's pace. I called the Razor company to see what could be done and they thought it was the battery pack which is on backorder (other's must have this issue?!?) and it wouldn't be in stock for about 2-3 WEEKS. It was a dud of a gift. I hope that it goes well once we receive the new battery. I also hear that the tires wear REALLY fast."
2,Fun while it lasted,"I got this go kart for my son last Christmas. He loved it and used it every chance he could. After about 6 months the electronic controller broke, then it needed new batteries and the brake wore out. It's really fun when it works but needs a lot of repairs."
1,Another Bummer,I purchased this and the mini chopper bike for my boys for Christmas 2004. The chopper bike never worked right and the company gave me the run around. The go kart ran longer by months but the battery never stayed charged for more than 30 minutes. The belts have broken numerous times. My son would rather ride his power wheels than the mess with the go kart. Now it does not run at all. My 3 year old sits on it and pretends she is going somewhere. WHAT A WASTE ON MONEY AND A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT. To make matters worse the company does not stand behind thier product and continue to sell the hunks of JUNK!!!!
4,"Great ride, but tires wear out fast.","My son loves this thing, but with such a low ground clearance the chain drive catches on the bumps sometimes. The tires lasted about a month with him driving it almost every day.I did add a switch to it so it now has reverse. Pretty easy, but tough to get an open space inside the engine cover to mount it.Now I am on the look out for new tires. Hopefully I can get real inflatible tires. Has anyone seen any?"
4,Great item,This was a great buy we live in a court so this was a wonderful gift for my 4 year old son he rides around in circles and loves to play with it. Not to mention all of the neighbors come out to play. The only thing i didnt like about this item was the fact that the brakes are on the steering wheel which makes it difficult to brake for my son. He has learned a way around it because if you let go of the gas trigger it will slow down pretty good not a complete stop so my son has learned to gauge the amount of room he will need before the car will stop completely. I really in all like this go kart better then the power wheels because you dont have to take the battery out to charge the car.
1,"Fun, but small and easily scraped (And now broken)","I saw all these reviews about how this isn't for kids that are young. My son is 6 and rides this thing with no problem, its actually a little small for him. His legs are all cramped up. Makes me wonder if the other people here have very small children, or possibly I'm raising a giant. The brake is getting scraped up and bent all the time since it sits close to the ground, its a pain to bend back and fix. The entire bottom of the cart is scraped up, but it doesn't seem to affect the drivability.The battery life on this thing is amazing. My son drove this almost two miles on a single charge. Lots of fun, adults don't fit well on it though.So, here's an edit: Its now broken and refuses to move. Kinda sucks, I guess we'll see how the warranty works."
3,Go-Kart,I bought this for my son for x-mas Dec.09. We have snow in Wisconsin so he haven't had a chance to ride it yet. It looks cool!!!
3,Was Ok.,"I got my GoKart in 2 Days and it came fine. After about a week or two the brakes broke and wouldn't work at all. We called razor, and for my opionion they had the worst service. I recommend this but if something breaks. Razor won't have that great of service that you would think"
4,kids enjoy,The kids enjoy it a lot.Don't go in the rain. It's fast.My son got one in july for his birthday and the chain brokein dec.Other then that we like it.The kids all want to ride it.
4,Nice cart,It's fast for ages 8 to about 12. It seems a little small but the kids love it. It's well constructed. Only dislike is the turning radius is a bit large.
5,Great buddy movie and western!,"Robert Redford and Paul Newman are quite the combo in this film, highly recommended for anyone who likes westerns with a good dose of witty writing and a buddy story at the heart of it all."
5,Great Movie,"This is my second favorite movie. It's funny, yet touching and it really makes you fall in love with Butch and Sundance and you find yourself rooting for the two-bit outlaws. this movie is very well done. I've read books about the duo and have done a report on them and I'd say the movie is pretty accurate but still great!"
3,Butch and Sundance,"This was an ok movie. It was not up to the hype I heard about it. I was a little disappointed, I don't think it was worth the rental price. The best part of the movie was Ted Cassidy."
3,What happened to George Roy Hill on the commentary track?,"This is a beautifully designed DVD of one of the best movies of all time, with many interesting bonus materials, most of all the contemporary documentary. The 1994 interviews are enlightening, but the film would have been worth of an updated, retrospective documentary. The title's biggest fraud though is ""commentary by George Roy Hill"". He can be heard about three or for times on the audio track, and all statements are taken from the documentary. Robert Crawford does a nice job, but when he has to explain to us, what he thinks, Hill was thinking during a particular scene, one wonders. Conrad Hall goes from interesting to the usual trappings of documenting your work: ""Isn't this nice lighting?"". All in all, a good buy of a great movie, with some wasted opportunities. But there's always the 35th anniversary edition, let's hope all the key players will still be around."
2,They Broke My Heart,"I loved this movie from the first day my dad made me sit down and watch an ""old movie."" What they've done to the sound quality here is an absolute atrocity. MONO sound??? Let's get real. The least they could have done is upped it to Stereo so that I wouldn't have to listen to it through the center speaker the whole time."
2,Overrated,"Wasn't this a big Hollywood production? Couldn't they afford to film on location? The sets of ""Bolivia"" look like they were filmed on location in rural California with local Mexicans as extras. If anyone has ever been to Bolivia (or even opened an encyclopedia), they know that Bolivians look, speak, and dress nothing like Mexicans. Watching this ""classic"", I couldn't help but be floored by the incredibly poor job they did in the closing sets of the film. Any historic value the film might have had went down the toilet for me during those last scenes. If you are primarily interested in movies for their popcorn entertainment value, don't dispair, as you probably won't even notice this flaw. For me, it really ruined any value the film might have otherwise had. Its like casting Keanu Reeves as Hamlet, and somehow he pulls it off, but at the end ""Bill"" comes out then he an Hamlet embrace and say ""Excellent!"". Oh never mind."
2,totally overrated,"despite the fact that i love paul newman, this movie is pretty awful. some decent cinematography and good moments with newman can't make up for the fact that redford can't act and the script is hollow. not much happens and we go on a journey to nowhere. not recommended. highly overpraised"
2,What's All the Fuss About?,"I watched this ""classic"" after hearing that it was such a good movie. Where's the beef? I fell asleep half way through it, then forced myself to watch it.Yes Redford and Newman are attractive, and in other movies they are superb actors, but this movie just did not move me."
2,Great movie - terrible restoration!,"This disc ranks right up there with one of the worst Blu-ray transfers I own (along with the first Stargate release). It is a shame, as this is a really great and fun movie. It is one of the first westerns I recall that really interspersed humor with drama in an effective way. I thought it tried to be a bit too much or to have something for everyone (the bicycle scene went on a little long for my taste, for example). Audio is fine but the failure to produce a really outstanding video transfer (as was done with Patton recently) will disappoint the many fans of this movie who were eagerly awaiting this release."
5,A Classic!,"This is one of the classic films of my lifetime. I wore out my video, and had to update it to DVD."
3,mostly entertaining despite anachronistic music,"This is a mostly entertaining look at a couple of bank-robbing buddies and the female teacher they both love. The cast members and locations are good and the story is interesting enough.I just didn't care for the goofy soundtrack which is somewhat anachronistic, and I am not sure what happened to Etta at the end.Also, the lengthy montage in the middle that is supposed to tell us of the trio's journey across the country and then to Bolivia seems out of place and odd."
4,Rain please go away,"If you are a Robert Redford fan this movie is by far his best. It's not Paul Newman's best work, but he is good. Katherine Ross is one of the sexiest actresses of the time. This movie starts fast and never stops. Also Jeff Corey keeps it real."
5,The West at its Best,"Among all Western movies,old or new,this ranks among the best.It is a classic:funny,sad and beautiful.And what beutiful phtographie of Utah landscape!"
4,Golden Oldie,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has meant a lot to the western film genre. It's spawned the Speghetti Western films, started the 'buddy-film' movement, and ditched the tradtional western music for a more contemporary one.BC&SK; is really the OG of the buddy films. Loosely based on historical facts, this is a tale of two friends out agianst the world. With the duo of then-superstar Paul Newman and up and coming sensation Robert Redford, the acting is superb. The writing is very good; just funny enough to be above a sitcom, but not so much that it's a comedy.A great deal of detail is brough, I love the sepia tone montage, desperado shoot-outs and the variety of settigns. While BC&SK; did break major ground, it stays simple and is face value with it's message. The perfect movie to just relax with."
5,Well worth the price!,"Great movie. I think some of the best work by Newman and Redford. Captures some innocent moments that shows that even dangerous outlaws have a heart. Good soundtrack too. I may be somewhat biased, this was one of the first movies I ever got to see at a movie theatre."
3,"Disappointing, lazy Blu-Ray transfer","Such a shame that such a near-perfect movie is given such poor attention in the area of remastering. The Blu-Ray version is unbelievably grainy, and even the most SIMPLE touch-ups were left alone. For example, with many old films you'll often see a little thread or fiber on the corner of the camera lens; an antiquated, distracting imperfection, which could be EASILY buffed out with modern editing technology (literally, a 6th grader could remove it in seconds). But, wouldn't you know it, FOX was too lazy to do anything to it. Definitely wait for a ""remaster."" I bought this film on Blu-Ray when it was at $[...], and I wouldn't even say this version was worth that amount. Now that Amazon moved the price up to [...], don't even think about wasting your money on this excuse for a high definition transfer."
5,Great Blue-ray redo,"I was impressed with the remake of this blu-ray movie. I enjoyed, so much, the original, and the remake is vivid and yet not overdone. Great job, and blu-ray is awesome. Delightful movie"
5,One of the Best Westerns Ever Made,"Should have won best picture for 1969. How MIDNIGHT COWBOY got it, I'll never know."
4,Classic Western and crowd-pleaser,"Butch and Sundance (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) are two affable outlaws who bear no malice toward anyone although they make their living by robbing trains and banks. They enjoy their freedom and their easy-going camaraderie until they make the mistake of stealing from the wrong man, a powerful millionaire who sets a skilled, relentless group of hired killers on their trail. From then on, death is always in the background, implacable and ever-present. They may escape for a time, but the end is unavoidable./Newman and Redford have great chemistry. Their timing and the way they play off each other is the main delight of this film. This movie helped redefine the modern Western and issued in a slew of buddy pictures. Watch it to see two Hollywood legends at their finest in a hugely entertaining film."
2,narrow screen,I hate the narrow screen it takes away from the movie. The movie is great as far as the acting and the story goes all these wide screen movies should be made in HD so they fill the screen and add to the Quality of the picture.
2,dissapointed,Disapointing storyline and thought there would be better acting from these two great pros. The female part is laughable. Would can this dvd.
1,THEY SENT WRONG COUNTRY DUHHHHH,"BAD, THE THE THE THE THE THE THET HET HRTE KITE DUHHH FFFH HI OH HO GO GEE GEE GEEEE"
3,Entertaining but not a great film,"It seems to me that this film wants to please all ways it can use. Is it a comedy or is it not? There is no feeling of old west, because the main persons are very modern. I don't understand the meaning of ""Raindrops"" -ballad in between. It makes everything even more unreal. Actors are good and it is very well done, but I have no feelings for it. I do not care criminals as heroes which makes it impossible to identify. Randoph Scott westerns beat this any day!"
2,Perhaps I missed something,"This is considered a ""classic"" but I was disappointed as it seemed to me that it was lacking in dialogue and substance. The theme song, ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,"" appeared misplaced and irrelevant."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed. The CD was loose in the case and scratched when I rec'd it. Also, it appeared to have been reshrink-wrapped and not ""new condition"" as advertized. It was meant to be given as a Christmas gift, however, I would have been embarrased to give it to the recipient in this condition."
2,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid [Blu-ray],"If you like this movie as your memory it is probably fine, otherwise it is a predictable, poorly staged old movie. Robert Redford is not a good actor after all, just good looking. Blu Ray is OK."
4,Butch and Sundance Kid,"This Movie is a good movie, it really opened my eyes to really understand how the outlaws did things. Two very good actors."
3,Great scenery but not timeless,"This is one of those odd films that was pretty great at its release but failed to weather the test of time. It's about two bandits (and a gal), who travel the west, and ultimately to Bolivia, robbing banks. Their big thing is to not kill anyone.It's a bit of a love story and, for me, that was the superior facet of the movie.If you saw this film when it was released, and re-watch it now, it's a bit of a disappointment. The director relied heavily upon cliche-type material and that is the chief failing of the work.I will comment that the cinematography is just excellent, which makes the movie still somewhat enjoyable to watch. But it's not at all a film that most western fans will savour."
1,dvd butch cassidy & the sundance kid,poor quality -stopped half way through movie - could not advanceButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Widescreen Special Edition)
4,Get it if you can,"To find a book that was written in 1994 and having only one other review on Amazon.com is, indeed, a surprise. Particularly since it was a well-received novel. I’ll not stoop to repeat what my fellow reviewer (June 17 1999) has said, since he sums up well the strengths of Shadow Hunter, and you’ve plenty of time to read just two reviews!Will Baker broke the mould with this book – a mixture of political comment and science fiction. His images are deep and lasting, though at times his narrative and introversion is a little too long and tortuous. Nevertheless, Shadow Hunter is a great read for those who like something out of the ordinary. It’s well worthy of four stars which, unfortunately, is more than can be said for the sequel, ‘Star Beast’. If you can get hold of a copy of Shadow Hunter, you should do so before it completely disappears. You’ll find it well worth the effort."
4,Reformation Information,This is a good book about the people involved in the Reformation and their contribution to the evolvment of the world thereafter.
5,A good companion to How The Reformation Happened,"While others might fault Belloc for repeating essentially the same thesis about the Reformation that he put forth in How The Reformation Happened, he still does a marvelous job of sticking with a good formula and adding new twists to it. In this work he does brief sketches of the lives of the most influential political, military and philosophical figures of the time and shows how they related to the religious revolution known as the ""reformation."" As he weaves these 23 lives together he shows the reader how their private and public choices lead to the shipwreck of Christendom and how the European civilization after the Reformation was rebuilt. All in all a facinating read that I highly recommend."
1,"""History"" by adverbs","This book may be outrageous fun, but it certainly isn't history. It evades any attempt to offer a reasonable analysis of the complex social and ethical struggles which emerged in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries by describing people's behaviour by adverbs. People behave ""heroically"", ""honestly"", ""loyally"" (Romanists) or ""greedily"", ""dishonestly"", ""weakly"" (non-Romanists). It will probably appeal to people who still retain a lingering regard when people were sufficiently certain of their beliefs to set fire to those who disagreed, but it really won't do for a democratic culture.But it is fun. It argues a hopeless cause with all the dishonesty of a magician."

About 125 illustrations, mostly photographs with some technical drawings; many color photographs.Map, End Notes, Glossary, Index, Foreword, and Preface."
1,Never sets,"If you are trying to get ineradicable black stains all over everything that's even close to what you're trying to glue, this is the stuff! However, if you were hoping to actually make two things adhere to one another, well... You put this stuff on, come back 24 hours later, touch it and it's still wet, and now your fingertip is dyed black. 48 hours later, still wet. A week later, still wet. Never sets, zero adhesive capacity."
4,Great sealant,"Used this to seal the gap in the drill hole in my door panel where I installed my tweeter. As you might expect, it is a bit difficult to get it all applied just as you want, but that's a limitation of silicone itself rather than this product. When applied correctly it makes a solid, somewhat flexible seal that looks good on my door panel's black vinyl."
2,Ido not like it,I do not like it because it seemed to be old and dried up and I could get very little from the tube. If it had been more fluid it would have been wonderful. Judith Spaulding
4,A Good Sting,"This won't make you into the next Angelina but it does do a great job of giving you baby smooth skin. It rolls on easily and the acid just stings like you really want to itch your face. But don't worry, it's not painful. It rinses off easily and when applied very regularly (for those with a better memory than myself to do that) it can definitely lighten blemishes and help erase the mistakes in your complexion. I started using it because it's very similar to what my favorite spa uses in facials."
4,Good Product,"I bought this product to fade my tattoo. It was shipped to me quickly. It serves its purpose in that it is easy to apply but as far as using it for a facial chemical peel, I don't think it would be convenient for application on the entire face. For that purpose I would recommend the gel peel product. If you just want to target spot areas then this might be what you want. It's handy and not messy due to its roll-on application."
2,glycolic acid peel,"The problem with this product is it is hard to get enough on your face at one time. It doesn't roll on very easily. By the time I get enough on my entire face, it is time to take it off part of my face. The glycolic pads work much better."
1,"The first treatment is the best, but...","After that initial treatment, the sting lessens (And I LIKE that feeling because then I know my skin is reacting!) and it just makes your skin feel like it does after a brisk workout...just a little tingly. Hasn't helped discoloration."
4,smooth,"This is the first time to purchase a Forrest blade and it certainly won't be the last. I haven't had it long, but it has easily cut 1 1/2"" oak without burning, even on a slow cut. There's a little splintering when crosscutting, but nothing out of the ordinary.It's definitely worth what I paid for it."
5,"Do Not ""Passover""","What a wonderful and creative debut. Bottom line: If Jim Morrison were alive today, this is the band he would be in. Be sure to catch them live, they sound great."
4,"Best Album, Thus Far, for 2006","The Black Angels are what you get when you meld the Brian Jonestown Massacre's psychedelia with the Jesus and Mary Chain's wall of sound from their early days. That alone should tell you if the album is for you.The music is great. The lyrics try too hard to be deep, meaningful and bleak at the same time. They're not bad but they do show a lack of subtly. Still, even with that this album easily blows away anything I've heard this year."
3,let's be real,"let's be real, this is a good disc. BUT let's not give every disc you like a 5 stars. you have too think, is this really a 5 star disc?? the answer is no. giving a band 3 stars isn't a crime...its the truth. this is a good disc. not a very good or great disc, but good. 3 stars."
1,Didn't understand it..Didn't like it,"I have to say that this was aconfusing mis-mash of a movie. I didn't understand half the things that happened in it. The end was a total let down and I'm still puzzled as to who was alive, dead, a ghost, or what. Rent don't buy. I fast forwarded thru parts because it got so slow that I was almost falling asleep several times. i had high hopes from reading the reviews, but my hopes were all dashed."
1,Am i losing my mind? how can so many people like this bland movie,"I have seen my share of asian horror and this was probably the worst film I have ever seen. Do NOT waste your time with it. I am shocked by the amount of people that liked this film. The ""twist"" was so basic to figure out in the FIRST SCENE. I usually like asian horror because of the pace and twists but this was so boring. Nothing happens for the first 30 min then a Juon ghost appears and the nothing happens again for 30 minutes then a juon rip of ghost come back again then nothing happens for 50 minutes then its over. WEAK! SO dissapointed! : ( no if u excuse me, my mom is calling me for dinner....."
2,"Better off renting or streaming, save your money","This movie came up on my recommendations. I read the reviews and saw the 4 1/2 stars out of 5 so I thought I would buy the movie based off this. It wasn't a horrible movie but it was definitely overrated. The movie starts out real slow and it does have a few good scare you/creep you out moments but overall I was a little disappointed. I wrote this review in hopes of keeping someone else from making the same mistake I did - buying it. Save your money and try streaming it/renting it on Amazon instead of buying it.I purchased the 2 disc special edition but haven't gotten around to watching the bonus stuff yet. If I do and its worth writing about, I will update my review."
5,Awesome Film,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought a Tale of Two Sisters. Up until that time I had only watched Japanese horror movies. A Tale of Two Sisters is now my favorite asian horror though.The movie really makes you feel like you've been thrown into the middle of psychological madness. The characters are very real and sell the acting well. The creep factor of this movie is very high. It can at times be a bit confusing to the person watching, making it even creepier.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Asian horror films.This movie is equally disturbing as it is beautiful. The story is very good, very intricate psychological horror."
4,This stayed with me for at least a month,"I only gave it 4 stars and I'll tell you why. Everyone markets this as a horror movie and it is, but it is only truly frightening the first go around. After that, my feelings are that it is one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. I love the story, I want to know just what Korean folk story this is based on. The colors used in the movie were excellent and set the mood every single time. The characters were very good, I like the stepmother. The ending is one of the best I have seen in a while, I couldn't get it out of my head for a long time. To me, the ending was so important because not only is it such a complex story but also it's very different form almost every other horror movie ending without making it feel like you were jipped after sitting through it.*This review is based on the 2 disk special ed. with subtitles.*"
1,DVD Video Quality Review,"I enjoyed the flm quite a bitand I'd like to view it again,but...The quality of the video imageon this Tartan Asia Extreme releasethat I purchased through Amazonis so bad that it might as well bea bootleg burned on an inadequatehome computer.I have a number of TSA DVD's andthose are excellent, thereforeI developed a positive dispositiontoward their releases similar to theway I view Dragon Dynasty and Anchor Bay.I'm over that!I have not read any other reviewersthat have the same complaint soperhaps I was simply unlucky andreceived a damaged disk.I e-mailed Tartan Asia Extremewith my complaint and received animmediate response requesting theUPC number and some other informationwhich I did send and then I receivedno further contact from them.I assume that means that they areno longer interested in my problem."
3,rent before buying,"i recommend renting it before buying. the movie is not bad, but it feels like a mixture of The Sixth Sense and A Beautiful Mind. For more originality, I recommend ""The Other"" instead."
5,HollyWood beware.,"I gave this movie 5 stars because it delivers what it claims to, and I feel like I got my money's worth.Hollywood is often criticized for creating special effects extravaganzas with very little storyline or chracter depth, but as is the case with ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", the big budget version definitely has something that the original could have used.Most western horror films use cgi to create a spectacle. ""Tale of two sisters"" does the opposite. CGI blends so well with live shots that you never notice them at all.If more Asian studios follow this example and add a touch of spectacle, I think they could rival western studios for successfull world-wide releases."
4,Really Great... then confusing... then pretty good,"This film is full of everything I like to see in Asian horror; tension, gasps, screams, jolts, people interracting for absolutely no reason! Honestly, though, this is one of my favorites. I have had to watch it over and over, but it's a treat. If you don't speak the language and have to read the subtitles, like me, you won't miss a thing. Moments of horror are not overshadowed by you rewinding and going, ""What'd he say?"" This film will leave you feeling erie in all the right plaes.I wil admit, though, that I ws a bit confud at the end, and it took a minute to figure out what was going on. There is a trick ending, but nothing like you'd imagine. Even still, when it all comes together, it makes sens. Just trut in Kim."
4,Great movie!,"A Tale of Two Sisters uses a Hair-raising, unique style of horror. The film deals with our ability to cope with tragedy and the confusion this can causeTwo heroines, Yeom Jeong-Ah and Lim Su-Jeong performed very well. Especially Lim Su-Jeong's acting is overwhelming.I definitely recommend any person ready to open his mind to the Korean culture and to view a very good Korean horror movieOverall, I loved the film. I give it 4/5"
4,This chilling and psychological horror film is a must see!,"What's it about?Following the death of their mother, sisters Su-mi and Su-yeon return to their father Mu-hyun's lakeside house after a brief stay in the hospital. Their return is met with an aloof father and new stepmother Eun-joo whose over enthusiasm seems artificial. It's not long before strange visions begin to haunt Su-mi as she becomes increasingly obsessed with Eun-joo.Is it any good?The tension builds slowly in this Kim Jeen-Woon Korean horror chiller. Often beautiful and harrowing, it is also a story about adolescence, grief, guilt and mental illness. I personally found Su-mi's safeguarding of her sister very touching. Confusing at times towards the end but overall it is well structured, backed up with great performances with a good twist at the end.Best bit?The dinner scene; I'll never look under the kitchen sink again!Did you know?The movie is inspired by a famous Korean folk tale 'Janghwa Heungryeonjeon'."
2,...and it dragged on and on...The Uninvited was beter,"This movie dragging on for way too long. It took me 2 days to watch it, i kept waiting to jump or be frightened but it nothing happened. The plot wasnt even twisted, i knew what was coming next so the end wasnt a surprise. I watched the remake of this afterward called The Uninvited its was 100% better, scarier and cooler. My advice: Watch The Uninvited first, then if you have nothing to do on a rainy Sunday watch A tale of two sisters."
4,Pretty good..,This movie is like the asian version of the uninvited. It was pretty good. This movie will definately be going in my collection
1,Junk,"Sounds terrible, USB interface consists of six wires that probably wont work with your computer, and no instructions."
1,It's What's Inside That Counts,"Purchased this brass manifold about 6 months ago, but have to trash it now. Outside is sturdy enough but the ball valves inside are made of chromed pot-metal. It only took some months before the chrome separated from the pot-metal and the ball valves corroded. It's just more imported junk made to look from the outside like a quality product, assembled with inferior interior components."
4,"Great but, needs updated information","This is a great book. Keep it great and take into a 3rd edition Larry Anderson, please."
3,THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF BIG BAND CD.,I REALLY ENJOY TRYING NEW THINGS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. IT IS A BIG BAND ALBUM BUT WITHOUT STRINGS. IT DOES A GOOD JOB PLAYING THE OLD STANDARDS WE HAVE COME TO ENJOY. I WOULD HAVE RATED IT HIGHER BUT IT ONLY HAD 10 OUT OF 18 SONGS THAT I REALLY LIKED.
4,No Tri Fi Drums?,"I would like to give this recording 5 stars, but without Tri Fi Drums (Dan Ingram's closing theme) it cannot be considered a best of. Hopefully that song will surface on a re-issue."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"Obviously, I did not like this book. I spent most of the time I was reading it wishing it would end. I didn't like any of the characters and the plot left a few loose ends. Next time I will listen to my inner voice when it says - do not buy that book !"
2,A strong plot undermined by the subplot of weak wife and unf,"Like most readers, I was attracted by the nightmare of a mother dealing with a stolen child. Several improbable plot devices (ESP and and the sperm donor dying of AIDS) made even this potentially gripping plot weak. But, what irritated me was the fragile mother who could not seem to be critical of her grossly philandering husband who has sex with her sister in the kitchen many times while she is upstairs. The mother does not even ask her sister to move out and barely reacts when she walks in on her husband and sister. She does say something to her husaband--his reply is that he is a ""horny prick."" Oh, well! Everyone in the book knows her husband and sister are having sex and when one character asks her why she sticks with him her answer is that marriage includes even the tough times. The husband never makes any effort to reform, shows her no respect and it is left unresolved. I'd prefer a stronger heroine."
5,Suspense and realism from start to finish!,"Terrific! When some copyeditor wrote 'compelling' on this jacket flap, they weren't kidding. And a genuine cliffhanger ending. I enjoyed every page. Oh, and I liked the way the antagonists discovered the ... well, I'd better not say for fear it'll sppoil the story for other readers. Very clever. (Oh these antagonists are sooo devious.) Personally, I recommend that everyone in the USA and Canada read this book (other countries are invited, too) if they want a really super story with super-real characters. I liked Rachel, the protagonist and I think every reader will identify with her -- like her, root for her, want everything to come out all right. And there are other characters, some of whom I dislike (ranging from mild distaste to downright contempt) but this is what the author intended, so I guess that helped make it a better story."
4,"Not the best ending, but the only possible ending","I was not pleased with the ending of this book, but I am not sure there was an ending that I would have been happy with. The Dark Tower Series is one of the best series written, and I strongly suggest you read it."
2,"White Light, White Heat","The quest of Roland Deschain for The Dark Tower ultimately becomes a circular journey - with a twist - as the best conclusion may come from the mind of the Constant Reader, as King brings to an end a series that was published from 1982-2004.The illustrations by Michael Whelan are fabulous and oftentimes the best storyteller. At times very tedious, oftentimes frustrating, with few flurries of brilliance - and ties to such works as Hearts in Atlantis, From a Buick 8 and It - the parallel to the timeless journey of an everyman can be inferred, but falls short without a proper coda."
4,Endings,"I've come to realize that endings have never really been King's strong suit. But, this one is far better than Cell or The Colorado Kid. I felt that restarting the journey was Roland's punishment for his obsession with the tower. Because he was so focused on it everyone around him died or abandoned him."
1,I wish I'd never started.,"Other (negative) reviews seem to sum up my opinion pretty well. Please don't start this series. If you start, please don't read the last book. It's really just bad. And it could have been so good."
5,wow....just wow,"I see alot of negative feedback from people who have read the book. I have to ask myself, however, what did you expect? A happy ending, all of them taking the tower and righitng the wrong, and living happily ever after? Cmon. Havent you ever read a stephen king before? He doesnt give a happy ending, he gives the RIGHT ending. Now, i admit, at first i was dissapointed. But as Mr King pointed out, its the journey. Read the book, then set back and digest all of the series. Think about it. Remember it, and follow it through to summation. It was amazing. I highly reccomend this book. If you like King, or just good writing, read this one. In fact, read all 7."
4,I love S.K.,"I work in a domestic abuse shelter and on my ""off"" time I enjoy reading books by Stephen King. This series of books are great. I love them all."
4,Two Books in One,"This book is long, and it feels more like two books. To avoid spoilers, despite the fact that it's been around for a while, I'll keep it vague. The first half is action packed and intense. Then stuff changes fast, and the second half has a very autumnal feel, and is very subdued. The climax to the series is in the first half of the book, with the second half being more of a retrospective deneoument than the culmination of several thousand pages of literature. This writer personally felt like the final confrontation was a bit of a cop-out, although the very ending was a nice touch."
1,Dark Tower Series - So Much Promise - Nothing Delivered,"The series would have been better off if a ghost writer or collection of fans got together at a pub and wrote the last 3 books. Wolves of the Calla took me two years to read, I skimmed through Song of Susannah, and read the first 100 pages of Dark Tower VII.The worst part for me is that I loved the series and characters. By the time I got into VII, I could care less. Wish Susannah would get run over by another subway, Eddie would OD, Roland would blow his other hand off, and Oy would get gurt and die. Only Jake still held any interest.Do yourself a favor and read the spoilers here in the reviews. I skipped to the last chapter of the book and then still didn't care how it ended."
3,not that good,I got the feeling that King just wanted to get this over with. Very disappointing. As I have said before. He robbed his career and literature by losing his notes off the back of his bike and not finishing the series early in his career. There is a distinct difference in the ones written early and the ones written late. But when I got to the end. My first impression was; That's it? Seemed he was in a hurry to finish and forced it.
1,Not Ka...Ka Ka,"As far as I'm concerned, King should have stopped after the third book because that's when his great story really ended. This last book in the gunslinger series let me down in so many ways (and was so anti-climactic) I lost count. I will never read another word of Stephen King."
2,"The Dark Tower, Book 7","How disapointing after more than 20 years of reading to have it all end in this fashion, typical of Steven King. I was hoping he would give this story his best effort, but instead it seems he just wanted to be done with it. As a long time King fan, I hate to diss this book, but cannot give high marks for this one. Inserting himself into the story lost all credibility for me. I wish I had stopped reading the series at book 4 or 5 as my imagination created several ending senarios that were better than the actual."
4,Finally,"Though the ending COULD have been better... what ending of a 4000 page series couldn't? King did a great job with the entire series and I am very happy that he includes his own take on the book and the ending in the very back of this book. It brings a little peace to those who are unhappy with it's end. Mostly, I felt the great accomplishment of tackling my first series."
3,A great series - a so-so ending -- spoiler alert,"I LOVED the Dark Tower series in general (maybe Song of Susanah was a bit tedious, perhaps). My biggest complaint - The Ending where poor, long suffering Roland is tossed back into DO-OVER WORLD - it's just completely WRONG!!!!I could take the death of the companions (though appropriately sad), but Roland deserved to go to his 'reward' at the clearing at the end of the path -- this breaks ALL the rules set up in the previous volumes ......... some worlds were NOT allowed to be changed or altered in any way -- therefore, Roland could NOT be tossed back into a simple rerun of his life, with a small detail change here or there. It was made clear in the early stuff - some things are permanent and some are alterable - this was a clear violation of the 'some things can't be changed' set-up. This explains the 'world has moved on', but doesn't jive in so many other ways. Its Fiction, but it should be coherent anyways........"
3,What happens to Roland?,"I don't want to give away DT 7, but I think there needs to be a DT 8 to finish the wonderful tale."
3,Disappointing,"I have faithfully followed the series since its inception and was particulary keen on how Stephen King was going to resolve this saga. Very lazy ending, signifying more of an Eastern Philosophy of everything in life just keeps repeating without a positive or negative resolution. Depressing view of existence. Also, did not like him killing off my favorite characters. My least favorite is the only survivor, with the gunslinger himself of course. He's the author, he can do what he want, but I'm the reader and don't need to spend that much time ending up depressed instead of entertained."
2,Ah so so ending,"Yes, as the author one should enjoy the journey of a adventure not the ending. However, that doesn't mean you give a so-so ending. My heart, which had falling in love with these characters didn't move one way or the other. I neither hated it or loved it. I think Roland's purpose the thing that drove the reader curiosity was this carnal hunger to reach the Tower. Where he was sacrifice friends , family and his very soul. To ending doesn't equate, balance out this magna-tic need to reach the tower where even his ka-tet he would even sacrifice them. For all those sacrificed the ending doesn't give them any good meaning."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY","So bad that I want to give this a ZERO star rating but the website only allows 1 star as the lowest. I have been a Stephen King fan for many years, but this book should be an embarrassment to him. And to be the finale of what was a great series makes it even worse. I plodded through it hoping it would redeem itself but it never did. Instead of reading this book in two weeks time like most of the other volumes, this one took me three MONTHS to force myself through it. What a waste and disappointment it was. I feel that SK copped out and also went to haywire with narcissism (perhaps a result of his accident?). If any of the earlier volumes in this series were written like this one, I never would have continued with the series. Sad. Utterly disappointing. This is going to make me shy away from any future writings he does."
1,Total Disappointment,"This last book in the DT series is a huge disappointment and an embarassment for King. In the afterword he as much as admits that the ending sucks and requests readers to not complain to him about it. I won't, since I got this book from the library as opposed to actually purchasing it."
2,Utterly sore and disappointed!,"After following the story of this ka-tet we've all come to know and love, King ends this saga in the most anti-climactic way ever. It's a cheap shot. Worse of all, several elements of the ending are inconsistent with given premises or rules, rather, in the book. Which makes the entire series much ado about nothing, unfortunately. Stephen King uses this book to do what most authors and movie writers know it is in poor taste to do...to make himself a character. The ending takes a cheap shot at the fans of Roland, and Stephen King does not apologize for it. A long, anti-climactic, and purposeless ending to an otherwise amazing series."
2,Disspointing and Detached,This one has potential for some readers to enjoy. Un-emotional and cheap death for our friends we've been following for so long. And endng that is laughable at it's attempt to be epic. A cheap and unaproachable ending to a series with so much promise and so little follow through. Stop reading after book 4 and you will be more satisfied.
3,What?,"I have been a life long reader and huge fan of Stephen King. I read Carrie for the first time when I was 12 years old and became a fan instantly. However, the final Dark Tower (7) was mostly a let down simply for two parts in the book.WARNING: SPOILER COMING UP!My favorite characters in this series were Jake and Oy. I wept when Jake died (for the second time in this series), but I absolutely bawled when Stephen King killed Oy. I know, I'm a weirdo. I really get into reading. Anyway, the second let down was how the book ended. Did anyone else get the sense that S.E. Hinton was helping Mr. King with that last bit?The series is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into a great story. But like with all authors, sometimes they write amazing stories and sometimes they suck doodoo through a straw."
4,The Saga's Timely Conclusion,"There's no way to finish a seven book mega-series without disappointing a lot of fans. I liked it. If anything it was the only ending that made sense. Jake, Oy, Eddie, Susannah and the Gunslinger reach the begrudging conclusion that I expected. The story complete, the ability to visualize the multiple/parallel universe actually seems real. Favorite of the series wasThe Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2). I got the impression that King himself didn't want this to end as he neared the finish line. The plot and twists just sort of fade away."
1,Pure Drivel,"After being seduced by the hard edged writing of the first three and a half episodes of the Gunslinger series I was more or less compelled to follow it through and buy/read the rest. I feel like a complete idiot paying for way overpriced pap by a writer that just went through the motions in these directionless and practically incomprehensible final issues. While the first three were tightly written and published in paperback at reasonable prices the author chose to ""package"" the remaining books in hardback and loading them up with meandering plot lines leading to a conclusion that had no meaning to me. There was no reason for this other than to get the price up by adding ""perceived"" value. Honestly, I feel insulted and made a fool of but very glad that it's over. Roland deserved better."
1,Why expect this one to be any better than the last three?,"After becoming absorbed in the series with the first three books, I trudged through the forth one waiting for the story to start. It never did. It was a needless 500-page flashback. I should have realized then that the rest of the series would be just as disappointing. I read books 5 and 6 - not great, but readable. I started book 7 hoping Stephen King would turn it around and go out with a bang. Unfortunately, once I got to where Roland realized that Jake knew that he (Jake) had to die to save said author, I just couldn't go on anymore, for many of the same reasons other reviewers have stated. It was bad enough that Eddie's death was not for some greater cause but now Jake's death is a waste also.I really don't even care anymore how it ends.I've been an avid reader since the late 70's and have not finished only a handful of books I've started. This one was that bad.Don't start this series, it will only disappoint."
5,Another great experience with Amazon,Ordered this book to help complete the set of the Dark Tower Series for my fiance. He really liked it and was happy to have all of the books now for this series. It was in brand new condition when received.
4,good book and good read,First off I like many have been reading these for about 20 years and I must say 5 and 6 disappointed me did not care for them very much but I liked The Dark Tower after coming off of the last two this is exceptional and unlike others here I liked the ending no it did not give Roland a hero end but was Roland really a hero I don't think so he was always in it for himself never really considering others until this last bookNow for the end I do believe he gave us a good ending he left us with hope that Roland stopped for the Trumpet this time And what really did most expect him to find in the dark tower God or heaven with his long lost Ka-tets that he mostly left in the dust whenever it benefitted him I think this was the best way to end it Ka was in control all along and sometimes it only takes small things to change you Ka (picking up the trumpet)
2,King's Everest left unclimbed.,"The previous reviewers tackled all the plot weaknesses that I could imagine so I'll make this rather short. The thing is, if anyone is looking to buy book 7 chances are they read 1-6 and have to read 7 anyway. The series is the only thing I have ever liked by King. Well, that was true until the end.(final 3 books) The Dark Tower epic should have been King's crowning feet, his Everest. Mr. King not only didn't make it to the top, he only got about a quarter of the way there and decided that it would be too much work to finish the climb. The self-centered universe idea was not only the thoughts of an ego maniacal man, but thoughts of a weak mind. It would seem that King got an itch to finish the series and didn't have any answers so he jumped at his first thought. I really can still recommend the series just because the first 4 books were so good and you can't have a story without an ending.(no matter how bad)"
4,The End?,"I, like other ""constant readers"" have waited expectantly for this final volume to arrive. Each proceeding volume had become longer and heavier (in true King style). Each one more and more involved. We came a long way with Sai King from the days of THE GUNSLINGER at only 224 pages to climb the steps of The Dark Tower together.I loved the ending (with the exception of the revelations concerning the Crimson King) I won't give it away.My only complaint is about Sai King's obsession with his near death experience and his endless need to bring us through it with him again and again. It bombed in Kingdom Hospital and muddied the trip to base of The Dark Tower.That said, I own the complete collection and even own a copy of the original THE GUNSLINGER (the short original version).I have spent many enjoyable hours with Sai King and Roland Deschain. I love the Arthurian connection. This is after all the tale of a Quest."
4,not as bad as all that,"This contains spoilers, so be warnedI took one star off for some of the issues others have already addressed here at length--the easy deaths of Mordred and Walter/Flagg and the insertion of Stephen King into the story. I could have done without SK in the story, and I felt Mordred and Walter/Flagg should have been more formidable than they were.However, I loved the ending. As I got closer and closer to Roland's arrival at the dark tower, I read slower and slower, because I felt that I was at the dark tower equivalent to Christmas eve--you know how as a kid whatever you imagine Christmas to be is always better than its reality. I couldn't imagine how SK could do justice to what was inside that tower. Amazingly, I was wrong--no descriptions of how neat it was, or how Roland sat and talked with God--those things would have been nice, but boring. Revealing how it was all really a trap for Roland was much better, if not as happy, as any ending I would have imagined for this series."
1,A Sad Decline...,"I got hooked on this story, and from the first book to the fifth I just couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of the next one. The last two were pale in comparison. I kept reading simply because I had to know how it ended, and now that I know...I feel Cheated.Mr King took a great story and drove it into the ground. Im glad its a chapter of my own life thats finally over....NEVER AGAIN"
1,i tried to give this book zero stars...,"If the rating system would have allowed I would have done exactly that. Stephen King allowed his egomania to run too far amuck in this book. He attempts to be clever with prolific literary allusions, but only so he can put himself in the same light as truly great authors. I have to admit that I enjoyed these allusions in the beginning. In the end of the series they become over obvious forecastings of what is to happen next. I truly loved the first four books, and five and six are ok. Seven is simply the worst book I have ever read. It is the very first book I intentionally left unfinished, other to flip through and learn how every one dies, and of course what a hoax the tower it's self turns out to be.There are only about ten good pages in the book for every one-hundred. While those ten are often very good, the other ninety leave me disgusted.Stephen King has let a great series become a cheap amalgam of other's literary genius."
2,Constipated Reader,Wow. Have been waiting to post this review for a while now and am finally getting into Amazon so here goes...This was a crappy way to end the series and it should have ended with W&G.; Better to have not reached the Tower at all then to have reached it like this.
3,Disappointing,"On the age old scale of one to ten, I can only give this one a 6 (say sorry). I loved the series and will likely re-read it but I may not re-read this one. King's writing style is a little different in this one than in the others in this series and his other ""non-tower"" books. He often talks right to the reader and also lets us know what's coming in the scenes where big things are going to happen. King uses much more ""in-world"" language in this one than in the other books, too. Also, let's just say that certain enemies are rather easily disposed of. In the afterword, King says that he's not to crazy about the ending himself, but says that it ended the way it should. I would agree with this, but had higher expectations, as the endings of his books are often huge, but not in this tale's case. Don't get me wrong, I did like parts of the book, but overall, a little disappointing."
2,Disappointed,"Basically, this series went downhill for me once Mr. King tossed himself into the story as a character. I hoped that, unlike Song of Susanna, that this wouldn't be a major part of The Dark Tower; that he got this out of his system with the 6th book. This hope is thrown in the garbage not only with the continued emphasis on the Stephen King character, but with the totally lame death of one of the most important characters in the book; a lame death directly related to King's presence as a character. It seems to me that time spent on the King character could have been spent developing Mordred beyond the nothingness that is his character, and involving the man who has been Rolands nemisis from the start instead of killing him off early and simply without Roland's involvement.I really didn't mind the ending and could put up with the other little things not so great about the book, but put those on top of the presence of the King character, and you simply have failure."
2,You came so close,"As one who read the first three books (Gunfighter, Drawing of the Three, Wastelands) over twenty years ago, there was a period of time when I didn't know if the ""quest"" would ever end. Now I wish I would have left them on the train (Blaine the pain) and not gone any farther.Stephen King: You cheated us. You had it all in the palm of your hand, but your hands wet with sweat, and your soul needs a rest, your fooling yourself and you don't believe it.... You are killing your self and you don't believe it. (Thanks to pink floyd)What kind of ego lets you incorporate your own being into this thing? It was not about you, it was about Jake, Susan, Eddy, and the Gunfighter. Pretty hard to bring Oy into the new world wasn't it?If you want closure, do not read this book. If you want to have Stephen King come up with a bunch of lame ideas and stuff, read it. Crimson King Spider shirts for everyone."
3,somewhere inbetween,"This wasn't prime King, and it wasn't totally what I was expecting. It fell a little short of my expectations, but still, King is King."
3,Good--but certainly not great,"This book (and series) is definitely worth reading. Any ending would have been a disappointment considering the expectations this series has inspired. In spite of the fact that the villains presented no challenge in the end and were vanquished too easily and in spite of the final events in the Dark Tower itself, the book is actually enjoyable.My only genuine complaint is regarding ""the lecture"" from the author at the end to his ""goal-oriented"" readers and his advice not to write him any letters of complaint or come visit him. I could have done without that. Who does he think he is anyway?"
5,CS112,This book was definitely an awesome ending to a great LONG story. I've been waiting for years for the ending of my favorite series and it's finally here.
5,Buy this book now,"If you haven't read the first books of the series, go read them, then buy this one! It's one of the best, most creative series I've ever read. It will pull you in and you can't stop reading."
3,VULGAR!,"I have the (audiobooks) for the entire Dark Tower Series. While many of them have one or two parts that were grotesque or vulgar...this book had 10 times that.There just were too many disgusting descriptions of brutal killings, [...] villains, booger eating mutants and vulgar sexual innuendos. All of it was very unnecessary to the plot and I would warn anyone with a queasy stomach that this book may not be for you.The plot was okay...but it dragged on and on with unnecessary descriptions of towns, and characters...that seemed at times endless. Maybe I've just had enough of the series...who knows, but I truly was relieved when this book FINALLY ended...strange ending or not."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was a big fan of Stephen King.Like most of thes reviews,i tofind this book very disappointing. The series needed a muchbetter climax. If you have not read any of the books in theseries,then don't bother reading them becauce the final book.Is highly disappointed at the outcome. If I could go lower then oneStar I would . A very BIG! let down. Mr King needto try again when he is not takinganything for pain. Maybe he can do a better job."
2,Ending not worth the journey.,"I'm going to keep this review as sparse as possible because in the end my point is brief. I enjoyed the journey to the Dark Tower, all the books had moments of pure delight and in the end the characters were what I enjoyed most. However, the ending was so incredibly lame that I still can't believe that anyone could be satified by it. Are they just trying to justify anything KING does by saying ""it's the perfect ending"", when in reality it's not an ending at all? You know things are bad when KING himself has an Author's note that basically states that the ending is garbage and if you don't like it then tough. This was my first Stephen King book or series and it will cerainly be my last. Excuse me while I go vomit..."
1,Say sorry.,"Oh woe. Oh discordia, do it please ya. I truly believe the real Stephen King walked through a door somewhere and a Femelo wrote this as well as Wolves and Susannah. An absolute waste of time. In this world, Mid-world, End-world and every world. Ultimately, everything that meant so much throughout the volumes (the Rose, the Beams, the Tower itself) mean nothing at the end - which is really no end at all. Nothing is explained, nothing is resolved. Say sorry indeed, Mr. King."
5,Great Series,"I read the original series of books and the first one really grabbed me. Kind of hard to follow at times but was hooked. Hated seeing it end and was a little disappointed at the ending. I guess after waiting years for the ending nothing may have lived up to it! Loved his mix of western, fantasy and the modern world. I wish he would bring Roland back in another novel."
2,It's all messed up...,Spoilers alert. I was disappointed in the finale of these seven stories. It was so un-fulfilling. I wanted a more traditional happy ending and was really let down. I hope that someday King might write a better ending that he might publish posthumously.
5,A fitting end,"If you've been following the Dark Tower Series, this is a must read. If you haven't, more's the pity. I think that, from previous comments, many people may be missing a key point. Some of the less satisifying plot resolutions make sense as they are written since the epic quest is to save a world gone 'hinky'. Wierd things happen in a wierd world, and when the world accelerates, so does the wierdness. All in all, I was thrilled with the book,and felt it fit nicely at the end of the series."
1,Dark Tower VIII: The Wasted Opportunity,"I'll keep this brief. King could have made this series worth something. He could have made a profound statement about the writer as God, about the reality of characters--how they live in our minds, how a character that lives in the writer's mind can journey on within the imagination of his readers. Instead, after an actually very good nine-tenths of the book, he gives us an anti-climatic showdown outside the Dark Tower, and a final resolution inside the Tower that is... horribly, horribly mundane and unoriginal.Oh, but I guess that's not King's fault--after all, he's just a CONDUIT for the story, right?Thanks, Stephen, for passing the buck. I still love ""The Gunslinger"", and ""Wizard & Glass"" was a beautiful trip. But the ambition and promise of the first books is dead. And in my mind, the Tower falls--flat on its face."
1,Commola Come Come - Good Marketing is a Chum!,"After six books that built up to this final volume, which should be a great climax, we get. . . this?I'm extremely disappointed. I could write about 20 pages of reasons why I'm so let down, but I'd rather just forget the series and move on to other authors who haven't been bit by the ""George Lucas"" bug."
4,SPOILERS - One Simple Question......,"There's no way SK could have satisfied everyone with the final volume of the Dark Tower series. No writer can satisfy all of his/her fans with one book - nevermind an odyssey that take place in 7 novels, took 30 years to write, and, for me, 10 years to read.I loved reading them - I will miss Roland and his ka-tet - and I pray that SK will not retire so soon - he has other worlds to write about...I do have one simple question to the other Constant Readers out there....Did anyone else anticipate/hope/feel that Patrick Danville was going to use his ""gift"" to give back to Susannah those things that she lost so long ago?Maybe I was naive - but as soon as Patrick asked her ""How Tall?"" - I assumed Susannah/Detta/Odetta was going to once again have the ability to walk on newly ""drawn"" legs."
2,A True Dissapointment,"As a huge fan of the Dark Tower series my expectations may have been a little high but I was dumbfounded with how weak this final novel was. The plot was weak and few of the characters stayed true to what they were portrayed to be in the first 6 installments. The nearly invincible anti-christ is easily killed by a baby and the king of all that is evil turns out to be a crazy old man with a box of hand grenades! Rolands faithful sidekick abandons him just before the so called climax but a character he met just days before stays with him! I didn't mind what was found at the top of the Tower but would have loved to have seen some resolution to the many loose ends - like who was Walter and why did he seek the Tower ect. If you loved the first six books, save yourself the aggrivation and don't read this one."
1,Stephen King leaves one for the toilet.,This was undeniably the worst book of all the Dark Tower series. Stephen King takes the opportunity to obsess on himself and his misfortunate accident in his latest and last Dark Tower book.
3,Finally Done,"After all of the reading and all of the waiting on this series I am glad that it is done. I guess if you write seven books about anything that someone is going to get tired of the subject. Well, I am tired. I still remember the good parts of the series and the ending was a surprise. It makes me feel for the gunslinger. With all of its ups and downs, fans and haters, it is reasonable that this series is not one of King's better known."
3,Thats IT??!!!!,"I, like many other reveiwers got hooked on Dark Tower because books 1-3 were so compelling. Book 4 infuriated me, 5 was passable and I skipped 6 all together, and didn't miss much, as I learned in 7. I just don't get it, I mean you're going to read it, because, like me, you NEED to know how it ends. But beware, it's long and many parts are very slow, it took me 6 weeks to work through this book, and I have read in The Stand in a weekend. If you like new Stephen King stuff, you'll love it. If you think Bag of Bones was his best work since It, you'll be very frustrated. How did something that was so full of promise when it started end up like this? In all honesty I wish he would have just never finished it, he wrote the work of a lifetime in The Stand( I think) all this needed was a better end, not 2500 more pages of BS. 3 stars because at least now it's over."
1,Is this a joke?,"You know - I generally work hard for my money. So you can imagine how I felt after shelling out on this latest King book, and discovering that it was a huge con trick. This book appears to have been written by someone who has not worked hard to deliver a special piece of work to us. It is really boring and the whole thing is more like reading a shopping list.I'm going to be bold and say that it's time some of these so called ""big Names' stopped trading on past glory and produced something original. Along with this book I purchased a relatively unknown book called 'The Seed' by an English writer called Davide De Angelis. Now this is all about something new and dangerous - check work like this out and see if writers like King can keep up. Time to move over. Sorry as I have enjoyed so much of King's work, but there is no excuse for a book like this AND it being a best seller. It's all hype. ZERO STARS!"
1,Outraged!,"I can't believe I actually wasted so many hours involved with this crapola! It's a classic shaggy dog story.Steven King is not a good writer at all; he's a brilliant story teller who talked himself into a corner on this one. We should have known what to expect, because King routinely has let-down endings. Nevertheless, I feel cheated.Update: I gritted my teeth and re-read 'The Gunslinger"" just this year (2010). Um, actually it contains numerous foreshadowings which I did not understand the first time."
4,Disappointing,"A disappointing final book in the series. It's like King just through stuff into the story to make it longer, and forgot what story he was writing. *SPOILER* For days afterwards I shook my head and muttered, ""I can't believe they killed Eddie."" ""They"" as in his murderers, not ""He"", as in King, the author. Cursing on characters is a high point for a book, in my opinion.The best part of this book is the part after the warning. What warning? Read it for yourself :)"
2,Uh oh,"Somehow I'm in the parrallel universe where the Dark Tower VII is lousy. It was all going pretty well. That there was a diminishing quality throughout the books we mostly agree. The starkly drawn briskly paced first book gave way to mass quantities of not unwelcome characterization and intrigue. Though still a little too charmed by his own earthy approach to classic fiction, King I felt had what it took to take me to the Godhead. Unfortunately no more of that sweet tasting sample found at the end of no. 1 was to be found (for me anyways) at this end.But maybe my luck will change, and I'll one day be able to see the rich spiritual allegorical mythological significance of this volume and it will all be revealed to have been great storytelling all along. Then maybe I'll take another look at the Matrix trilogy."
4,The end,I have been waiting to read the end of the Dark Tower series for a long time which has finally arrived! Another Stephen King Classic which will be remembered throughout history. Very nicely written but sadly dissappointed that this is the closure of a well thought out and great Epic modern adventure.
4,Stephen King fan here......,"Hi, I have read almost all of Stephen King's books and while this particular book is not at all his best work (lots of weird made-up gobble-dee-gook language and skipping back and forth in time and such) he once again makes it difficult to put the book down. Also, and I am glad he understands the minds of his devoted readers, he explains his quirkiness in the story at the end in his ""note"" and makes the weirdness ok...almost believable in fact. I will remain a devoted fan!"
4,Its not like we hadn't been warned,"Ka is a wheel. A very common theme throughout the series and indeed it was or is.I enjoyed this book although the ending was kinda anticlimatic. The story seemed to be rushing along at 100 mph and I kept thinking when is it gonna turn, when are we gonna slow down for the inevitable ending..Not as good as the first 6 but how could this have ended differently? Ka is a wheel.. indeed it is."
4,endings are endings,"Writing endings must be extremely difficult, and I'm not surprised that after all these years and all these books that SK has gotten pretty philosophical about it (the joy is in the journey, not the ending). To be honest, I've never been impressed by his endings. I always felt that the monster should have been scarier, the evil more evil. A prime example it 'IT' after all that it was a spider? I guess that in order for the monster to be defeatable, it must be tangible, and the moment it becomes tangible, the dark machinations of your imagination collapse into the author's explaination. What did you expect to find at the top of the Tower. . . the meaning of life?"
5,"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, Book 7)","A great book. This is Steven King's conclusion to his epic Dark Tower Series and it is a page turning marvel. If you have read the first six, I'm sure you will love this book. If you haven't, I highly recommend starting the series. If your are a Stephen King fan it is a MUST read. Long days and pleasant nights to all faithful fans."
4,Appropriate Ending for a Long Journey,"It has been a long journey for readers of the Gunslinger series. This last book seemed too long and a little irrelevant. But, it was all worth is for the most shocking yet appropriate finale. I felt the frustration and pain in that ending, but it was perfect."
4,Ka is a Wheel,"After 7 books and some 3800 pages later , the Dark Tower epic comes to a close. Roland is right back where he started. I enjoyed the journey and the only reason I'm not giving this book 5 starts is because the author inserted himself in the last two volumes. King explains why he did but to me,I thought it distracted from the story and frankly, there was no need for it. With the references to Salem's Lot and Insomnia made throughout book 7, King has made me want to go back and revisit those two tales. And maybe the gunslinger will follow as well."
4,Not quite the end of the journey,"If you've already read the first six books, you won't be able to stop from wanting the seventh. Like the Wolves of the Calla and Song for Sussannah, Stephen King shows a unique talent in making the all out weird seem real and believable. The only complaint which can be made is Coda section of the ending. While not a let down or disappointment, it leaves the reader believing their needs to be an eighth, ninth, or even further volume to this series to yield a final completion of the story, though that is surely not the author's intent."
1,< Spoiler > Lies! Vicious Lies!!,"< Spoiler >Yeah, I made it to the end. It sucks. It's not that it sucks because of what happens - what sucks is that it doesn't make sense. The Gunslinger is a semi-angelic character physically glowing (somewhere in book 6?) with Good, who finds himself turned away at the Gate. It's as though Goodness lied to Roland, which simply doesn't happen. Goodness doesn't lie; otherwise, it wouldn't be Good.So that's my issue with the book and the entire second half of the Gunslinger series: It lied. If you need more lies in your life then by all means, finish the series. As for me, I get my fill on the evening news."
2,Annoying!,"I enjoyed the first 3 or 4 books, down hill from there. Very annoying to have to flip past the first part of the book or the last part (6% of one book, however many pages on a kindle that was I don't know). I want to read the story not read about King talk about himself, his Tabby, etc. Grace the back cover w/a short humble bio and be satisfied with that, I will be. I bought the books to read a good story and be entertained, if I was interested in the authors life story I'd be buying auto biographies or biographies, not fiction! Inserting himself into the story? annoying. I am going to have to go back now and re-read the Stand or It to remind myself why I originally liked his books and reacquaint myself with good stories. I have ALL of his books but the further I get into this series the more I dislike it! On the last book now and instead of staying up way past my bedtime being thoroughly engrossed I am just anxious to get it over with."
4,The Dark Tower,"This book is kind of hard to write a review for. The series is so long and had so many ups and downs for me that I can't say I was completely satisfied but but that's not saying that I'm unsatisfied at all. I felt that since King dragged out some of this story way too long in some places that when he rushed through sections (which I thought were very important) I felt a little cheated at just getting a glimpse of what was going on. There are also points where I think King set up a plot points in a previous book but then just didn't really like what he set up later and just quickly ""resolved"" the issue in an odd/quick way.All good series and I'm glad I made it through to the end."
3,The Dark Tower Books: How I loved them until...,"The very last page! I have followed and loved these books over the years and eagerly awaited the publication of each and every one of them. I have spent many hours reading and re-reading them. I waited eagerly for the last one. I received my book and with bated breath I sat down to read. I was so disappointed at how it ended. I felt so let down and well, just plain cheated! I had expected so much more from the ending. Maybe Mr. King was just ready to be done with the series but still I think we the readers deserved a much better ending. Thank you Mr. King for an enjoyable adventure up until that point."
5,"A Dark Towering Masterpiece from ""The Dark Master""","I'll admit I am the Constant Reader that Stephen always references..I have been a loyal fan for more years than I care to admit. Starting with Salems Lot and ending with Duma Key. I never picked this series up. I didn't want to be strung along by a serial novel.When the final book came out I picked up the first one. I thought I would read one a month. I was wrong...I couldn't read fast enough. I finished all seven in under 2 months. I was hooked..I laughed, I cried and I shivered in the dark. This book had the penultimate ending.I have not re-read any books since the Tolkien series and The Stand. I am starting them all again from the beginning.Stephen King has rocked my literary world (again). He finally accomplished what he started at ""19"". Take the journey to the Dark Tower; you won't regret it."
2,Sputtering End to what could have been a great series...,"I am not going to review the book, that has been done many, many times...but I will give my thoughts.This book was not good and the ending was as bad an ending as humanly possible.The series hadn't been good since before The Wizard and the Glass, but this hits a new all time low. The way Jake died was the only good part of the book. Susannah's personality shifted so radically, and so suddenly that it was completely out of character. After 6 books, their story, struggle, saving their lives she reacts so strangely? If so, what does that say about her? Plus, the Tet Corp near the UN, etc...YUK!I am glad that it ended the way it did...maybe King will try to rewrite this and actually put some time into it.Terrible."
1,King must be sick of writing,"This final book is terrible. All of the complaints so many people have about it being rushed, and being a let down in the end, are understated at best. King basically seems to have just been trying to get it all over with in this one, so he rushed through the story, superficially dropping off the supporting characters like Eddie, while at the same time bringing in the artist kid like an easy dab of plot line superglue. This is very sad and disgraceful, considering that this is Kings supposedly greatest life's work, and the first four books were very good -Why did he have to go and ruin it on some crash course and shoddy spree to the finish line? Overall, a major downer."
2,Disappointment,"I'm not going into details here, save to say the continuous loop idea is so much malarky.The concept causes so many logical problems it doesn't make any sense.To go 99.999% of the way be left with that... well... Its not right, plain and simple."
2,One of the year's biggest letdowns...,"Well, actually, the letdown started with the fifth book, I think, but this was the letdowns of all letdowns. Everything has already been said, but I want to reiterate the whole notion of King just finishing this thing for the sake of finishing it. I was very disappointed to lose Eddie in some freak accident. He is my favorite character, and to die that way gave me the sourest taste in my mouth. How awful to do that to one of the main characters! And to think, the one character that Roland faces the end with is some newbie we really don't give a crap about. And his 'face-off' with the Crimson King...come on! What face-off? Danville freaking _drew_ the King away. The end. Gawd.The ending, however, was fitting, and I couldn't think of another way to do it. Everything else, though, sucked. Majorly."
1,still waiting rip off,I have not received my order. It has been over a month. I received notice it shipped and I still have not seen or heard anything. I feel ripped off. Amazon don't you ever read these reviews. Beware they stole my money and they might steal yours
2,Unreadable,"I'm not going to get into the ""who's-the-biggest-Stephen-King-fan-on-Amazon"" debate. I'll let my previous reviews speak for themselves. As for this book, it's unreadable. I gave it two stars and not one because I did like the cover artwork quite a bit and thought it was creative and well done. Also, even though this book is dawg-awful, it's still Da King and he is still one hundred times the writer I will ever be."
5,The best book of the Series!!!,"Dark Tower 7 was by far the best book of the series. The ""non-traditional"" plotline was quite refreshing and the conclusion was surprising. I particularly enjoyed the characters of Blue Heaven (the overseers) and really felt for them in the end."
4,"Fantastic ending! (no, seriously)","Admittedly, the last three volumes of the DT series have been a bit of a disappointment, and this final volume is extremely drawn out, but the ending is awesome and well worth hunkering down and going through its (sometimes dull) 800+ pages."
2,Tumbling tower.,"To quote Shakespeare ""What a falling-off was there!""Kings Dark Tower, described as a magnum opus, in my opinion has quickly devolved into a peashooter of puss.The series whose first 5 books held great promise and kept building up to a what I hoped was a literary climax in book 7.Only to have it fall ever so short. The characters which were so well crafted and defined are almost treated as tired loose ends which must be dealt with. King still retains his style of writing throughout book seven, but his handling of plot seems to have been stinted. I had some reserve when King wrote himself into the series and fear that it was well founded.The focus on the series is Rolands quest for the tower, a journey which many readers expected him to have a final confrontaion with his enemies, yet the ones we are treated to I found lacking. What should have been Kings masterpiece tying into the connecting threads of tower related books to form the tapestry of the series, ends up frayed and tattered."
2,A poor end to a declining series,"There are already many reviews that do a good job of describing most of the main problems with the book. However, some points need clarifying. First of all, the ending would be OK (the writer gets to end the book however they want), except for the fact that it doesn't make sense according to all of the rules of time-travel that the characters have discovered during the previous 2 books. Secondly, the ending of Mordred would have been much more clever and ironic if he had simply died of food-poisoning. The reviews are pretty on-the-mark with the other villian's deaths, though: they are just not very believable. And again, the characters' sudden obsession with slang speech is pretty annoying. Even more annoying is when reviewers use it. While better than Wolves of the Calla or Song of Susannah, this book is still does not nearly meet the promise of the first 4 books of this series."
2,Quite a Let Down,"I was just plain disappointed in the last Dark Tower book. I didn't mind author King being a character, that seemed rather clever, but the cavalier way in which the members of the ka-tet were disposed of, not to mention the removal of the various villians, seemed anti-climatic and unimaginative. Say sorry, sai King, but it was a Let Down. Poor Oye, what a way to go. And by the way, I don't get why Roland was being punished with eternal wandering -- yeah, he acted badly at times, I suppose, but he did save the universe, didn't he? You have to break some eggs to make a super hero omelet."
4,"An end, Thank you, thank you, thank you!","Waiting was a chore. I agree with one of the other reviews about the ending. You really do have to let it sink in before making any judgements about it. The more I thought on it, the more I came to understand it. So don't be too hasty to hate it."
2,looping at the wrong point,"I liked the series very much, until have read the ending.The idea about looping is wonderful and absolutely correct.However, the looping point returns Roland to the point where he is chasing dark man, while it should return him to the point where he could save his real Rose: Susan Delgado.She was that Rose, which Roland had lost.That was the turning point in Roland's sad fate, and only this could really stop his perpetual quest."
3,A fine ending to a sometimes directionless narrative,"The volume begins with much of the same lack of direction that hampered the previous volume. About midway through, King is able to remember what he was writing and brings it to a fairly good conclusion."
3,I was warned...,The ending is the ending... after all of these years to find out how it ends... I realize Stephen King warned us not to read beyond the end and then you do because it's there. All I can say is... hmmmm. It's over and what's next? Will it ever end? Will he ever succeed?
5,Ka is a Wheel,"The last installment of this epic series takes us to the colossus that we've all known waits only for Roland. King communicates the deja vu landscape well throughout the entire series, but it is never better than it is in this novel. In this dreamlike world we all expect to find something special at its conclusion. While the ending is going to be controversial, I thought it was a perfect fit for King's deja vu world...truly genious.While some of the pinacle showdowns proved weak (nothing new for this series), Roland's ultimate showdown with himself was well worth waiting for. King also follows book 6 with an insight into himself as he stars in his own novel. King takes it to the line, but backs off enough to make his presence plausable and arguably necessary.Five stars & quite a capper on one amazing life's work."
2,"Not with a bang, but a whimper","Like the universe about which he writes, Steven King's series is falling apart. I've read all seven books, and the series effectively dies after about the third. Steven King says he's retired, and I'm afraid it's past time. He's just mimicing himself, desperately trying to tie up all the BS loose ends he wrote into all his other works, and it just doesn't work. His earlier works were great, but for the last decade it's been junk, and I'm really sorry I was dumb enough to fall for it and spend the better part of $100 on the last three of this series. I won't buy any more his stuff, and I advise no one else to either."
3,Hurried volumes,"THe best book in the Dark Tower series was the first. Towards the end of the series, it is easy to tell the King was rushing to finish. THe end did not have that great literature feel that the first one had. THe first was by far the best and maybe even the best King book written. The ending to the series, although fitting does not give the reader what they want, nor do the readers really care for the characters anymore. 5,6, and 7 were hurried and therefore did not give the feeling that the first volume gave."
3,A bone of contention - Warning: Spoilers,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book, especially after reading the first six in the series. The copout of Flagg's easy death early on angered me - such a powerful villain should not have been taken down so effortlessly. Furthermore, Mordred doesn't seem to have much of a point; he stalks the ka-tet throughout the book, and then simply dies when he tries to attack (another easy death). Finally, I know that King warned that the coda was not a necessary part of the book, but after reading the rest, I felt I should read it. It makes the whole journey hopeless - Roland appears doomed to forever search for the Dark Tower and never discover the truth. I don't understand the point.Essentially, I thought King copped out on a number of characters and situations in the book, and I believe he could have done a much better job ending the series."
2,What a let down,"I really enjoyed the first 4 books of this series. As a matter of a fact, I think Wizard and Glass and The Drawing of the Three are both absolutely phemononal. I even enjoyed a lot of Wolves of the Calla (although the dialouge was really annoying after a while).That being said, the series really took a turn with the 6th book when Mr. King seemed to run out ideas. It's back and forth from this world to that from then on and the incorporation of himself as a character (and somewhat of a God I might add) is ridiculous. I heard him say a few years ago that after he really was hit by a car that people were more worried he would die and never finish the Dark Tower series. I guess that's where he got the idea of having Jake save him from the car but I though it was a terrible twist.I can only hope that George R.R. Martin doesn't screw up his Song of Ice and Fire series like Stephen King did The Dark Tower and Robert Jordan did The Wheel of Time."
1,"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, Book 7)","I've followed ""The Tower"" series from the first book, avidly! So imagine how I felt, when all seven books finally lead to Roland accomplishing his Dark Tower goal, only to have hime climb the stairs and blow a stupid horn! We are offered nothing else but lamely encouraged imagination usage thereafter, with the exception of Mr. King's afterword labeled ""FOUND (Coda)"" where he basically gives us an aggarantly explained ATTEMPTED CONSOLATION AS TO WHY HE ENDED THE BOOK THIS WAY. To add insult to injury, he does lead us to Suzanna after she traveled through the unfound door....but again, leaves us with nothing more than a ""wishy-washy"" scenario of her future.One last thought, if Mr. King cannot find his way to writing with his usual creativity and zeal sober, that may I suggest that he retire with nothing further? I frankly would have preferred he stopped while he was ahead."
2,What happened????,"The Dark Tower series is 7 book marathon, and the runner(writer) seemed to run out of gas after Wizard & Glass (book #4). After reading the book, I get the idea that ""Sai"" King has rushed another Dark Tower book. Books 5,6,and 7 all just seemed weak compared to the earlier Dark Tower writings. Stephen King dropped the ball, and he knows it. In this book he even takes time to make excuses, saying that he is sorry and that he did not control where the store went. Mr. King did not let the Dark Tower reader down, it was ""ka"" or maybe even the Dark Tower itself."
1,Stale Spices,All of the spices that I purchased from this company were stale and old. Some of them even had bugs in them. Star Anise is supposed to have a wonderful licorice like flavor. This had no smell and tasted like old cardboard.
1,Frommer's Singapore & Malaysia(Frommer's Complete),I was very disappointed in the book's coverage of Malaysia. Travel specifics are lacking. Most of the information given in this book about Malaysia is freely available on the Internet and current; the date of information given in the book could not be established.
3,"Good for Singapore, Not for Malaysia","Other reviews have mentioned that Malaysia (especially Borneo) is given short shrift. I agree. The Singapore section is helpful, however. In planning our trip we relied on Lonely Planet more for peninsular Malaysia and Borneo."
2,Should be named SINGAPORE & malaysia,"I was very disappointed in this book. Frommer's guidebooks are usually pretty dependable, but this one is the exception. Planning to go to Malaysia, I purchased the book and it has only a brief (about 100 pages) on the entire country of Malaysia. Have to buy another book. The Singapore section seems ok for someone going there.Frommer was very deceptive. If it were an automobile, they would have to issue a recall!"
2,Mayalsia? Look Elsewhere!,"Although the title of this book would make one think that both the CITY-STATE of Singapore & the COUNTRY of Malaysia would receive coverage equal to their size, think again. Two-thirds of the book is devoted to tiny Singapore and the rest to huge (in comparison) Malaysia. I guess it's not so surprising when you learn that the author lives in Singapore and is married to a Singaporian! Frommer should be ashamed of their title. It should more accurately be ""Singapore with a Section on Malaysia""!"
1,Not worth my time,"This book should not EVEN include Malaysia. Way over half the book is about Singapore. It barely mentions any destination in Malasia besides KL. The few large cities it does mention, little to no relavent travel info is covered by this book. Oh, maybe if you're a museum nut! That's not my kind of travel. The hotel references are made from a rich elitest snob point of view. I don't want to, and can't afford to stay at $400 hotels every night! My advise to you....BUY ANOTHER BOOK...NOT THIS ONE"
3,cheap quality,"It may be worth the price, but not a good product, you may not get the desired sound quality."
3,just ok,"just be aware that these are 'bottom of the line' type of extensions, with cheap connectors and very narrow gauge wire. they do the job, but there are better. try audioholics for a reasonably priced better gauge wire and 'gold' connectors. the seller is great, however."
1,Speick EdC (Eau de Cologne),"I didn't care for the orange nose this EdC has. Too strong IMO. I used it a few times and determined it has way too much orange up front for me to use. I offered it up for trade on a shaving forum and recieved a bottle of L'Occitane Vetyver (EdT) and a partial tub of Proraso shave soap (old formula) in exchange. The trader was quite happy with Speick EdC, so some users may very well enjoy this new version of Speick EdC, but for me, it has way too much orange in the opening"
3,Not like the aftershave,"I bought this cologne after purchasing the aftershave. The aftershave smells distinctly masculine, but not overpoweringly so. With it fading fast, I thought to supplement it with the cologne. Unfortunately, the two do not smell the same. The cologne has a much lighter, citrus / floral scent, with the citrus being the dominant fragrance. It's not bad, and mixes well with the aftershave, which is itself a milder scent, but is more of a unisex fragrance.The bottom line; if you're looking for a copy of the aftershave, pass this one by. If however you're looking for a light, daytime scent that is clean and mild, give this a try as it won't break the bank."
5,It works and it's MUCH cheaper,This battery works just fine and it's MUCH cheaper than the Nikon branded battery. That earns it five stars.
3,Err,"Great movie if you're a Manu Bennett fan and don't mind straight to DVD, B rate sword fighting movies. It was very MAN-tastic!"
1,A cure for insomnia,"The author of this book is an accountant that has written numerous books on numerous business subjects,,,he obviously is a jack of all??? definately not a Master of Technical analysis,,,The book is redundant and does not cover the subject matter well at all....."
5,Song Titles,Rare Northern Soul release from Eddie Leon. Hard to find 1997 self produced/distributed issue.Songs:1. Wrapped Up ; --2. New Sweetness ; --3. Thank God ; --4. Open The Door ; --5. Nothing Can Change This Love ; --6. Tell Me When ; --7. Just Tired Of Waiting ; --8. I've Been Loving You Too Long ; --9. My Turn To Play ; --10. Don't Need No Borrowed Love.
4,One of the best of 1997,"Don't believe the hype that ""Bandwagonesque"" represented TFC at its peak. ""Songs from Northern Britain,"" while not as immediately catchy as previous efforts, is far more satisfying. Retro in spirit without sounding dated, the 12 songs on this CD slowly sink in and are nearly impossible to get out of your head. Highly recommended."
4,A hazy dream to relax to,"Teenage Fanclub have been cult favourites on both sides of the Atlantic for a decade now, and have ahd some sales success in the UK. Not nearly enough mind you. As well as the hit singels in the UK (Ain't that Enough, I Dn't Want Control Of You and Start Again), the retro spirit of the Byrds is gloriously enacted on a scintilating trio of tracks midway through- It's A Bad World, Take The Long Way Round and Winter (the latter is so dreamy you will be humming it softly all week). A few others aren't so inspired (Can't Feel My Soul's Dinosaur Jr influence was unneccessary, and Mount Everest is too slow and plodding) but this is anotehr gem"
3,Ain't that enough?? no it isn't...,"Teenage Fanclub is playing British Beatles Rock styled music and they are good in it.the only thing is that...it's a bit boring!it starts with ""Start again"".nice riff nice vocals nice melody...later another song like this...later another one...i can't remember the titles...it's like one song was going thorugh whole album.fortunately from some place (around sixth song) the music is getting more variety because of more interesting guitar riffs and lyrics.""Songs from northern britain"" is s pleasurable album that you can listen to while reading newspaper or eating dinner or whatever.it features some good tracks but it doesn't stand alone proud compared to their other works.good but not so good."
2,boring,really - lack of good songs and plenty of unfinished riffs and boring vocals.i thought that Teenage fanclub would be something more english styled but the only thing that they remind me is a third-league american country band
5,OH MY GOD!!!,"I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SENCE I WAS A KID. THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT THREE KIDS WHO GET SUCKED INTO THEIR FAVORITE CARTOON ""DINO-SAURS"". IN ORDER TO GET BACK HOME TIMMY, MICK, AND JAMI MUST INLIST THE HELP OF THEIR HEROS (REX, TOPS, AND FORRY) TO GET A FUSE THAT WAS STOLEN BY CAVE PEOPLE KNOWN AS ""THE ROCKYS"" WHO WORK FOR THE CARTOON'S VILLAIN ""MR.BIG"". IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME TO DEFEAT THE BAD GUYS, RETREAVE THE FUSE, SAVE SAUR CITY, AND GET BACK HOME BEFORE TIMMY'S PARTRENTS RETURN."
1,Adventures in Dinosaur city vhs,"This item did not work , it was an unplayable locked up vhs tape that was obviously not checked before sending. Not happy about this."
2,Frustrating,"We just got the toy for Christmas. Over and over we have played just trying to get used to it, and as far as we can see..it stinks!The toy tells you that you are doing it wrong, even though you are not. We have been unable to get it to register past four in a row without it telling us that we didn't follow the pattern correctly-though we did. It seems as though it is too overly sensitve. Sometimes we just hold it in our hands and it says 'game over' just holding them!A true waste of time and money!"
1,THIS TOY SUCKS SO BAD,"i bought simon stix and it didnt even work i got new batterys and everything so i call hasbro and they sent me a new one and that didnt even work any better this toy is horrible they dont work and you are wasteing your money i would never recommened it, it is so BAD!!!!!"
3,ehh,Kids played with them for a few days and then haven't picked them up again since...not too much to say.
2,slightly different size,"I ordered batteries meant to replace AG13 sized ones. These were labelled AG14/LR44, so I figured I was set. It turns out that the AG13 are slightly thicker than the LR44 that were sent to me. Not much, but enough to mean that 3 new LR44 batteries stacked up aren't thick enough to make the proper connection in my reading light. That makes them pretty much useless to me."
5,Supa-dupa!,"When I first opened these I swore in a most furious manner because I was sure these were the wrong size! But upon further inspection I found that they did indeed fit perfectly inside the body cavity of my childs hexbug and I rejoiced exceedingly!! Much better price than the ""official"" hexbug batteries, and just as effective! Hellz, yeah!"
3,Cheap chinese batteries,"Not asking much of them, other than to power things like my led glowsticks (for the cars) and such. If you pay more than this for these sorts of batteries, check to see if they used a condom."
4,Have not used the item yet,"Amazon was bugging me to write a review for this product. Well, I haven't used it yet. The batteries are completely sealed in the package and look to be free of damage or other problems. If there's any problem with them when I use them, I'll come back and edit my review. Otherwise, they're batteries, seriously. They most likely have the voltage they're specced at and most likely provide the specced amount of mAh's. And, if a few don't work when I eventually utilize them, then I'm not terribly upset seeing as how the 10-pack only cost about $2."
2,Poor packaging,"Product arrived in the ""blister pack"" as shown, but the front clear plastic wasn't attached to the back cardboard except for two small pieces of scotch tape. Product was put in a regular Amazon box for shipping. Four of the cells were missing from the packaging, and only two of those were rattling around in the box -- I assume the other two fell out of the box in transit."
4,Works well,"They work fine. They do appear to last less than locally purchased ones (did not baseline) but you can't beat the price and even if they last half as long, it's still a better deal."
3,ag13/lp44 batteries,batteries are ok - did not seem to last as long as the ones that came in the original hexbug
5,Work Great - Cost Little,"I have a small flashlight that uses 4 of these batteries. When the original batteries died I looked for replacements in a couple of stores and found them to be expensive. I was about to throw out the flashlight, but then I found these on Amazon and now my little flashlight works just fine again."
5,Just as expected,"Received the item in good condition. Replaced the battery in my kids toy. Everything works as expected, although I am not sure how long the battery will last."
5,Worked just as described.,Really cheap and works great. Not one dead or weak battery.No cons at all. A must have for small flashlghts and electronics.
2,batteries died quickly,I use these types of batteries in some small electronics around the house. The previous set lasted for 8 months. The replacement batteries barely lasted for a month. Have to be careful with ordering batteries online.
3,Not from Maxwell,"The batteries arrived on time, but they were not from Maxwell as advertised. Maybe they will be just fine, but bait and switch tactics make me nervous."
3,Free Shipping - Not so much,"The batteries were ok. We had two duds out of 20 batteries, so I guess not so bad. The worst part about this product was the free shipping was not free AND I had to drive to the post office to pay the postage and pick up the parcel. The USPS told me that this is not the first time this company has done this and it seems to be a common practice for them..... hmmmmmmm"
1,dissatisified user,"The batteries were packaged well with tear away on every 2 batteries. I expected to get more time using the batteries before they went dead. I bought these to use in lighted fishing bobbers and within 3 hours the bobbers had dimmed to where you could no longer see them. The bobbers take 2 batteries to light up, so I don't think I got good use for the money spent."
5,10 batteries for 1 penny!,"i bought this from snowvoice. the batteries were shipped very quickly and (so far) work great.although the price for 10 batteries is only $0.01, there's another $5.00 for postage and handling but that's still a great deal. i bought 30 batteries and the seller even rebated me $1.50 on the total order. amazing!"
4,"Fast, simple, easy and inexpensive","I had checked for the batteries at Walmart thinking they would be cheap. Walmart's cost for one battery was about $5.00 per cell. I needed four and did not want to spend that much. I checked on Amazon and was able to get a 10-pack for under $3.00, which included shipping. I received the batteries in three days, installed them in the product, which is now working like a charm. I also have a spare set for the next time the batteries have to be replaced. Great purchase. Great experience. Great savings."
2,batteries don't last,I got this batteries for my baby's toy. They lasted 3 weeks and he didn't even play the toy that much. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,"Good Price, quick delivery","There is not much to write about button batteries, they seem to be good quality, the price of one locally cost about the same at a ten pack online from this seller."
5,AG13/LR44 Alkaline Button Cell Battery,These batteries are a really good price; I bought them for a calculator. For the same price of buying 2 I just thought of buying 10. I came to the conclusion there had to be something else in my house that used these type of batteries.
3,Not sure.,Well I don't know if the batteries just don't work or if the build a bear toy doesn't. I'll give the batteries the benefit of the doubt.
5,The Shoes of the Fisherman,"I enjoyed The Shoes of the Fisherman a great deal. It was a moving story, and the quality of the VHS recording was very good."
3,Interesting To A Point,"Although the concept sounds compelling, tracing Anthony Quinn's character's road to becoming Pope, it is a bit plodding, and the ending is somewhat jaw dropping in its implausibility. But if you're a Quinn fan, you'll enjoy his performance... and even be surprised at what a convincing Pope he makes."
2,Requires patience,"I liked the actors, just didn't care for the movie. It was a struggle to get through 2/3 of it before I finally gave up."
1,"GOOD ACTOR, BAD MOVIE","WHILE WATCHING THIS I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A TRUE STORY OF A PREVIOUS POPE. BUT IT WAS NOT. THE PREMISE, THE POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THE POPE WERE ALL FICTICIOUS.THE CONCLUSION OF THE MOVIE WAS THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SHOULD SELL ALL ITS HOLDINGS AND FEED THE WORLD, MAINLY THE CHINESE, AFTER BEING THREATENED BY CHINA WITH WW III. STUPID.HOWEVER, THE ACTING OF ANTHONY QUIN IS ALWAYS GREAT.I WOULD VIEW THIS FILM FOR 1 REASON ONLY, AND EXCEPTIONAL, ALMOST DOCUMENTARY STYLE ON THE SECRECY OF HOW A POPE IS ELECTED. THAT PART WAS WONDERFUL.HOWEVER YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP WITH THIS MOVIE WHICH IS WAY TOO LONG."
1,very simular to the golden locks and 3 bears,"Pure what if movie, the Chinese premiere comes across as the worse man they could have picked to play the part. Everyone else played their parts with varying degrees of success. The idea of the Vatican bailing out a starving nation (China) was ludicrous as Quinn (as the pope) reluctantly announced at the end of the movie. This is a long movie to sit through and really is a waste of time as we have to listen to David Janssen whining throughout the movie about his martial problems."
5,The Shoes of the Fisherman,I enjoyed this movie. Gives you an idea about the inner workings of the Vatican when it comes to electing a new Pope.
4,The Shoes of the Fisherman,"The Shoes of the Fisherman, love it. Is a beautiful movie, historical and full of hope.I receive the movie in short time and in a good condition."
5,A moving performance from Quinn,"Although he doesn't have much to say, Laurence Olivier is suitably morose as the Soviet leader and Oskar Werner shines as a priest torn in self-conflict. But the real star obviously is Anthony Quinn, who took the role seriously and brings Kiril Lakota to life. Sweeping photography of Roman and Vatican scenes only add to the deliberate pacing of this film, which grows upon repeated viewings."
1,NEUROVISION BY TELEX,"there was a song called a/b in this lp/that's what I used to have it on..and I loved that song soooo much.. now its discontinued by the manufacturer.. What a bummer..why on earth would they do such a thing? I've been looking for this cd for years.. and finally found it in amazon, just to be disappointed again.. This is such a cool cd.. please make it be available again.. I will buy 10 copies of it.. one for each member of my family... the album is called Neurovision by telex..It's the bomb!!!"
3,Those cadenzas!,"Like the earlier reviewer, I was repelled by Immerseel's cadenzas, which are not as negligible an element in a performance as the reviewer suggests. What happens is this: Weil, an excellent period conductor, builds up the tension, and things grind to a screeching halt; Immerseel tinkles away negligently for a minute or two, the listener dozes, and wakes up when the orchestra re-enters. It's all very well for Immeseel to claim period authority for improvised cadenzas, except for one thing -- he isn't a Beethoven or even a Czerny. He has the spontaneous musical imagination of a potato. The three stars are mostly for Weil and the orchestra; the rest of Immerseel's playing is decent, apart from those times when he feels he has to give us something of himself. This usually entails gratuitous pausings, emphases or pushings of the music. When he sticks to Beethoven, he's generally OK."
1,evaporates in hours,This product smells of alcohol and not gardenia's. Once I filled my diffuser I was shocked to see it had evaporated within hours. AND no fragrance!
5,Sweet sentiments!,"I put this book in a bridal shower basket. I loved the sentiments except for #4 ""I wish no one ever makes you eat brussels sprouts."" Hey, brussels sprouts are delicious!!!! lol"
4,"High quality, durable, servicable","Three years ago, I bought a Superpista after doing a relatively large amount of research on floor pumps. I chose Silca's Superpista for several reasons: It is made in Italy, therefore the workers who made it are much less likely to exploited the way workers all over Asia are; Silca is a brand name synonymous with quality, and has been for decades; All parts are replaceable, so if 15 years down the line a gasket in the cylinder needs to be replaced, I can get one from Silca for a couple dollars instead of having to buy a new floor pump (cheaper for me and better for the environment); and the pump goes all the way up to 210 psi. Try finding a manual pump with a higher pressure limit... I don't think you can. With a 60 cm cylinder, it doesn't take long to fill up my tires to 140 psi.Con:The head can be very difficult to remove from a Presta valve. I am considering using Park's PFP-4 head on my Silca pump. Then it would be the best pump in the Milky Way."
2,horse fly whisk,"The hair on the fly whisk is nice and thick, the handle is a sturdy bamboo. However, the wrist strap is very flimsy and the tape that holds the hair to the bamboo unraveled the first time I used it. I had bought 2 planning on giving 1 as a gift. But the quality is not good enough for that. If it makes it through the summer, I will be amazed."
3,Product good - postage costs ridiculously high,The whisk itself was a good price and is a very good prduct but the $65 dollar cost to get it to New Zealand is absurd. It is such a light item and not bulky - how could it cost that much. I'll make sure I take a lot more notice of the shipping details in future.
1,My frame also bent,"I only got 4 openings out of this frame. It was difficult from the start and by the 4th time almost every one of the joints that did not have a support backet on both sides were bent. Unfortunately, I did not buy from Amazon and I'm getting no response on my warranty."
3,Durability less than expected,"I have kept the tent in its casing whenever not in use and stored it upright, exclusively. The only wear and tear the casing has received is sliding in and out of the truck (plastic bed liner) once or twice a week, on average. After about 100 slide outs the casing and the tent were starting to wear through. I'm disappointed in the durability of the fabric.I like the height adjustability of the tent compared to our previous EX-Up tent (name escapes me now). The price was good ($138). After 14 months of moderate use the casing, or carrying bag with wheels, has basically disintegrated and the outer trusses are starting to bend and break at their weak spots (at the joining bolts).Good tent, but could be improved upon even for the price. I've seen $70 tents around me hold up longer than this one."
4,So Far So Good,"I have only had this tent up three times so far, but set up and take down was a breeze as with the rest of my E-Z up tents over the years. Bought this model for the cross brace design. No five star rating cause I just haven't used the tent alot so far. Seems very well built."
1,No Side Walls Included,"In the Product features it says that it includes a roller bag and 4 pack sidewalls (3 standard and 1 mid zip) BEWARE there are no sidewalls included. Amazon is selling something that it doesn't really include. The ez-up is great but what I bought isn't what I got.Product FeaturesColor: Royal Blue | Size: 10-Feet by 10-FeetIdeal for outdoor events, picnics and parties, sporting events, arts and crafts tables, backyard barbecues, fairs and festivals and personal use250 Denier polyester top includes roller bag includes 4 pack sidewalls (3 standard, 1 mid-zip)Accessories involves roller bags sidewalls instant table directors chairs stake kit weight bagsSets up in seconds, white powder coated, rust resistant frame available in size: 10-feet by 10-feet; white in colorMeasures 62 by 10 by 7.5 inches"
3,Where's the side panels?,The description did not say there were not side panels and I figured it would have them since my other ez up did. It was dissapointing that it did not have the side panels when I opened it up.
1,Don't buy,"My 4 1/2year old son received this toy for Christmas, when we put the batteries in, it kept freezing up and clicking off. It also made loud static noise which would scare him. I took it back to the store for an exchange and the new one had the same exact problems. It looked like it would be a very good educational toy, but we will never know because neither of them worked. We will be sending the second one back tomorrow."
4,My son loves this toy,My Son loves this Toy. His aunt gave him it for Xmas and other family members brought him all of the other programs so he can interchange them. He takes it in the car when on trips and loves it. Thanks Vtech. I also recommend this product and all the accessories. Get the ac adapter to save on batteries.
2,My kids were not impressed with this toy!,"My kids ages 6 and 7 love the Leapfrog system, so I thought they would find this toy exciting and fun. It was really a disappointment. It is rather expensive and is not very durable. My kids played with it for a few minutes on Christmas day and haven't touched it again since. It was really hard for my 6 year old to figure out without my help. It is going back to the store. I recommend the Leapfrog system, my kids love it."
5,"Great book, for its target audience.","This is a very good book, provided you belong to its target audience. Ideally, this means you are a grad student in math or applied math, with at least some basic knowledge in FA. I would not recommend it as a first book on the topic for someone who has never seen FA. But if you did pick up some FA along the way and now you want to take a step to the next level - this book would be a great choice.The author also supplies important historical facts about how many of the great mathematicians in the field of FA were murdered by the Nazis (most, but not all, of them were Jewish). Now forget the math for a second; for this alone, the book is important."
2,Mom of two girls in colorado,I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter for her birthday. This vanity is extremely small (short). My daughter can not just go to her vanity and look into it so make sure she looks like a princess she actully have to sit in the short stool and still bend down a little. She is not very satisfied with it and neither am I. If I could return it I would.
4,Great Little Vanity!,"My daughter, 3 1/2, got this vanity for Christmas this year. She LOVES it. She ""makes up"" all of her friends, Grandma, etc. My daughter is tall for her age, and when we put it together I worried it was too small, but she fits just wonderfully on the little seat and is having so much fun with this vanity. Though, the only one who ever does the lights and sounds is her 2 year old brother."
3,Eye-opening,"Though the book shows some of the deficiencies of self-publication, The Facade has to be one of the most perspective-changing stories I have ever read. If you can ignore the fact that ninety percent of the action takes the form of a meeting during which opposing viewpoints are bantered back and forth, the real scholarly work shines through and grabs you by the eyes. This book makes me want to go out and learn how to read Hebrew for myself; the concept of a divine council is new to me, and gives the scriptural text so much more credence when viewed in its proper perspective. I hope that Mr. Heiser has a sequel in the works; he certainly left it open for one."
5,For a Time Such As This,"This book is a skillful and outstanding weave of fiction and non-fiction. But, make no mistake, I am not talking about disinformation here, with which this whole subject is rife. His sources are well spelled out and can be acquired by anyone. The concept put forth, that the modern ET and UFO phenomena are a great deception that reaches back into antiquity, is not just a fun thing to consider. It is essential to know the truth, and Heiser presents what is probably as close to the truth as one can get with this whole thing. I applaud his work. I am sorry to say it looks like this book is out of print, judging from the high price and only used copies available. I found it in my local library. The only complaint that I would have about it, is that it ended on a huge cliff hanger, and I don't think there is a follow up novel. I encourage anyone who reads this to check things out for themselves. The conclusions drawn by the author are solid ones."
5,Entertaining and Informative,"This book is one of a kind. It takes a lot of skill to work in fact and fiction, and that's just what this author has done. This is perfect for both the fiction and non-fiction enthusiast. I highly recommend."
5,Stunned,"Dr. Michael Heiser is a brilliant scholar whom I have followed for years and whose writings I have incorporated into my own research on various biblical topics. He is, however, also an expert on all things UFO, which at first baffled me. Having read some of his writings on the topic, I can see the great research that has also flown into this area of his academic interest.His book, The Faade, is a fascinating way to pull his passions together into a great read that incorporates true happenings and documents with a fictional account. I recommend it highly if you don't just want to be entertained, but also educated."
1,Oh Please!,"This is one of the poorest examples of writing I've ever encountered. The story is hackneyed and been done before. Mr. Heiser may have a PhD, but a sheepskin doesn't guarantee writing ability, of which the author obviously has little. So, please, look elsewhere for thriller reading. Just about anyone can do better than this."
4,Great but still get the original,"I loved this book. I read the original edition, and then checked out the new one. The new edition is definitely more exciting and is better for a modern audience. However, from an analytical point of view, I prefer the original. The first edition is slightly tedious, but it spends more time presenting evidence and discussing theology to back up Heiser's hypothesis. To me, this is critical in a novel designed to educate in an entertaining fashion. While the new edition is certainly more entertaining, I doubt that I would have taken the author seriously regarding his ideas about extraterrestrials/supernatural beings."
4,An enjoyable read. A good start to a promising series,"A pleasant combination of C.S. Lewis and Michael Crichton. At times it kept me on the end of my seat. Intellectually stimulating, while still appealing to the fantasy. Heiser has made an interesting mix of theology with the UFO culture. If you enjoy the X-files you'll find this book a must-have."
2,Frustrated 20 Chapters in...,"Years ago I saw an episode of Quincy Jones MD. which was an anti-drug PSA. In it Quincy was spouting off facts in unnatural dialogue leaving minutes of frustration before something happened. This is what my experience of The Facade has been 20 Chapters in, and frankly, I will probably not finish the rest. Sitting in a board-room meeting for chapter after chapter is not a good way for characters to discover what is going on in their world. Maybe I'm missing out and it gets amazing in chapter 25 or something, but I threw my hands up in the air at 20. This may be a minority opinion. I had the same response to the discovery chapters of Da Vinci Code. These lengthy sections feel like someone took paragraphs from a paper arguing for their conspiracy, and then pasted them in a dialogue."
1,Really bad.,Here you have an example of a really boring and poorly written book. Nothing new here. Another garbage Christian book disguised as a sci-fi thriller. Don't waste your money on this book.
1,The Sexual Repression is Tangible,"A Devil behind every bush. That's it folks in a nutshell. That and adolescent sexual fantasy right out of the 50s. It's a religious book in an old fashioned stomach turning way with a modern twist. Sounds like fun doesn't it? You could read it with a flashlight under the sheets and maybe get arroused as well. You know, if your looking for this kind of thing there are some serious open-minded researchers out there like Steven Geer and Jim Marrs. Of course many will prefer fantasy."
1,RIP after 2 years,"It was a great monitor while it lasted. (Only 2 years) Was working and then screen went blank.... Thought the computer died. Fortunately it was just the monitor and I had another to replace it. I came back to this page just to find its specs so I can get a replacement.Sorry ViewSonic.... you are off my list, permanently."
1,view sonic lcd screen/ worst company I have ever dealt with!,"View sonic is the worst company I have ever dealt with. I bought a lcd monitor from them not even 2 years ago. starting having problems from the get go, with lines down the screen, then it all of a sudden stopped working. called customer service got the run around, they do not value there warranty. I will never buy anything from view sonic again, and would never recommend them to anyone..."
4,"Tries to be Jill Scott and it doesn't quite work, but still an album well worth checking out","Amongst its many strong points, this album has some nice beats, a nice understated subtleness that goes hard against all of the in-your-face, over-the-top schmaltz that most contemporary R&B is today, and absolutely no rappers. The midtempo material is acceptable if not superb, but dreamy, wistful slow jams like ""Smile Again"" and ""Meantime"" are just exactly what pure, organic soul should be. On the weak side, her style is certainly respectable, but her singing skills lack the refinement of those of Jill Scott or Ledisi. Still a winning effort that makes many other 2002 soul albums look bad."
2,"It's alright, but nothing to get exited over!!","I have to aggree with the person that gave this cd one star! I give it at least one more star because there is one song I like on there the first one. I have to aggree with the person that gave this cd one star. it is not a Neo Soul album. I would not compare here Jill Scott,Lauryn Hill, India Arie, Badu, Jaguar Wright, Floetry. Those artist stand out from others. and they have a jazzy, funkadelic, Blues, 70's sound. Conya doss doesnt. She sounds like any other R&B artist singin about the same old [material] ""Oh my Baby Left me your no good ... YOU MAKE ME FEEL GOOD."" The 0nly song that sounds Neo Soul is ""Good Good"" other than that the other songs are not. If you you are and R&B Fan you will like. But other than that DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Mediocre at best,"I'm writing this review because I can't believe this BORING CD is rated 5 stars. I've heard better music in local bars at 3 o'clock in the morning after the vocalist and band had a few drinks. The music is completely boring, the singing is only okay. Nothing here to buy. If it comes on the radio, you will probably sleep on it."
4,Great Album!!,"I'm biased because Conya is a friend from college and I spent 4 years listening to her sing all over campus. BUT, I really enjoyed this album...every bit as good as any other neo-soul artist out today. I especially enjoyed the song ""Selfish Ones""...I wish it were a whole song instead of just an interlude. This album is just a taste of her talent and I hope we hear more from her!"
5,Excellent!,"I read the review on this CD in a recent edition of Honey Magazine, and decided to go to my local music store to buy it. To my suprise, they didn't have it and neither did any other music store in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Because it was no where to be found in my city, I decided to order it from Amazon and I am extremely happy that I did. Why everyone is sleeping on this CD, I don't know, but they are missing out on very good music. Conya Doss' CD is excellent. There isn't a track on it that I don't like. I'm look forwarded to bigger and better things from Ms. Doss. DON'T SLEEP ON IT!!!"
3,very nice.......,"I decided to listen to this cd after seeing her on the ""Customers who bought...."" list and I have to say that she is refreshing. It is unfair to compare her to Jill Scott or even Mary J. Blige. She is in a catergory that would have Faith, Kelly Price...singers that have a true radio friendly R&B flava. Its not mind blowing, but its alot better than Ashanti (a hell of a lot better), Beyonce, kelly Rowland. et all. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars....With better song lyrics, she could be a 4"
3,3 1/2 stars,"Conya Doss - A Poem About Ms. Doss (Orpheus, 2002)Some people say this album is brilliant, others say it's not good. I say that it's somewhere in the middle. Conya Doss doesn't have the strongest set of pipes and a few of these tracks have trite lyrics (like in ""Good Good""), but the slow jams really moved me. I especially like her cover of Norman Connors' ""Starship""; perhaps remaking songs is one of her stronger suits. I also enjoy ""Heaven"", a duet with Zero, who was also heard on Gerald Levert's ""Your Smile"". This album is good to listen to on a nice long summer drive in your car. There's nothing extraordinary here, and whoever said ""Move over, Jill Scott"" should maybe listen to Jill Scott a little harder, but this album isn't a stinker, either. Borrow it first. -EJR"
3,Busting out,"While the zipper openings are an interesting twist on nursing wear, the dress I bought in size small seemed to run a bit tight in the chest area. Even though I am petite in stature, I needed more room in the bust and needed to return the dress. It was a cute pattern and might have been good for casual nights out but not what I was looking for to attend awedding with my nursling. Things are a bit more formal in the tri-state area."
3,Certainly worth a few bucks or a few pennies ...,"In the vein of Natalie Imbrugia-Michelle Branch, pleasant adult alternative pop. Most of the tracks are simple guitar or light instrumentation. It is commendable that they didn't over-produce this CD to drown out her fine voice. The songwriter is serviceable but nothing really noteworthy (with only one truely treachly track). With her soothing and sometimes sexy voice and well crafted A3 pop, this would be a nice background CD on a Sunday morning in a coffee house - you wouldn't want to over-analyze the simple lyrics but the rest of it goes down pretty smooth. You would definitely be over-paying at $18.99 but for a few bucks USED, you are definitely getting your money's worth."
4,DOUGH!,"After listening to the track ""Radiation"" you'll be glowing like none other than the jolly Homer Simpson taking a dough nut break at Springfield's radiation plant...the song is a definite treat! (Just don't try eating the cd unless plastic is part of your diet.) Not only is it catchy but the song follows the Twisted Tenderness style that Bernard stunned us all with. Imagine a hyper beat with standard New Order/Electronic guitar! Its deep fried, caked with frosting and totally Yum Yum! And no, I'm not a cop!"
2,For the avid fan only,"This album is, well, not very good. The only reason I own a copy is because I have been a Sandra fan for so long. If your buying it for the enjoyment, try ""Wheel of Time"" or ""Into A Secret Land"" instead."
1,Worst album of Sandra Cretu.,"After sensual and filigree ""Close to Seven"", this CD is something terrible, this one is arranged and produced by Jens Gad. There is no understanding to me about track Won't runaway that's the worst song of Sandra ever, so I don't understand about the choise to release it as a second single of this album. Michael Cretu wasn't involved of making this CD (He had worked to enigma3 that was released one year later with big success). Only value of this CD is the First Lullaby, produced & writed Cretu - Gad together. So I give this one star for this beautiful song( the song is worth all 5 stars, but album only 1!), that you can find in Sandra's ""My Favourites"" collection."
1,It belongs in the time in which it was written,"Got them (both parts), glanced through and threw them both in the trash right there and then. The man wrote a treatise on the long life and yet he couldn't preserve his own to an old ripe age... Paracelsus is the name he assumed later in life - meaning superior Celsus (a Roman physician). That alone, in my eyes, warrants the treatment of his works in the way he treated the works of others before him. I have to give him - he was a prolific writer and some stuff he got right. But if you string words together randomly, after much writing you'll get something right.... for some this might be a very entertaining read but not for me. I can't stand mixing religion with science and his audacity in selling his thoughts/beliefs for facts knows no bounds."
4,"""Introduction""? Maybe if you're a grad student in history","Maybe if you're a grad student in history, this might be an ""introduction"". If you're a lay reader, this might be a tad much in the detail department. Blair commands the material, but the material itself is a tad on the dry side. I say that as someone who's read a fair amount of books about ""late antiquity"" and the ""middle ages"". Part of that is attributable to the obvious fact that Anglo Saxon england was a brutish, hobbseian kind of place. Certainly its a thorough read, but it lacks fun and is a slooooow read for a book of 350 pages."
5,Nissan Multi-Function Can Insulator,"The Nissan Multi-Function Can Insulator is a lightweight versatile stainless steel holder that effectively keeps canned beverages cold. My mother and I find the product allows our soft drinks to remain cold after more than two hours. I have two conveniently stored in the center console of my automobile, 1 at the office, and 1 in my luggage for travel."
5,The can cooler that works,"I first purchased 1 can cooler to try it in the hot weather. I was very surprised that it worked better that any can cooler I had ever used, so I purchased 12 more and now everyone enjoys them at our outdoor events."
3,Great machine at the time,"I actually bought this machine when it was released about two years ago. It replaced (thanks to the warranty) the m6809 which died after only three months. This one lasted about 16 months, then the graphics card gave up the ghost. I also had chronic screen and soundcard problems, but when it worked it was a pretty nice machine.I found the speed, graphics, and other features quite good. At the time it was the only laptop to offer the AMD Athlon 64, with a dedicated graphics card, and under $2000 (it priced at $1650 originally). Few machines at the time were offering widescreen in that price range also. Though if anyone bought one of these laptops or is considering an eMachine laptop, I highly recommend an extended warranty."
3,Adequate machine...,"This is a great machine if you can find it for a decent price. Acceptable video performance, decent upgradability, DVD+/-RW. Know this though, the hinges on this are junk. This appears to be purely cosmetic though. Other than that I've had no problems and had it for about 1 1/2 years."
1,Big Mistake,I thought this laptop was going to be a monster. I have had to sent it for repairs 3 times in 1 year. I purchased the Best Buy service plan (also crap). The will enforce the lemon policy only after the 4th repair. I am hoping something else goes wrong so I can get rid of this thing. Every single problem has been screen related. While I was waiting for the geek squad guy to help me I was talking to another guy in line with the same machine I have. He was needing screen repairs. Best Buy should now this thing is a lemon by now but the insist on waiting for the 4th repair.
5,Perfect for dictation,"I use this noise canceling, directional microphone with anOlympus DS-2400 Dictation recorder (142015)for recording dictation or voice notes for my later review. It includes a removable clip, and is designed for use while clipped to your lapel or collar. This microphone works best when the recorder is in Dictation (vice conference) mode."
4,Works well but a bit bulky,"I purchased it to plug it into a Dell Laptop Inspiron 6000 that had no built-in microphone.Main use is Skype, and it works very well, you can sense the noise canceling feature.The only drawback is that I was expecting something a bit more tiny that I could leave on the laptop all the time (which is possible, BTW), but I'll live with it."
1,Not worth it,"This product audio is very poor. Even with my mouth in front of the microphone it could hardly pick up the sound of my voice. Don't get me wrong, if I yelled into the thing it did pick me up just fine but with an inside voice, sitting at my desk with my laptop in front of me it hardly detected my voice. The person I was talking to had to turn their audio way up, I had to increase the mic volume on my PC all the way up, and then he could hear me a little bit. I do not recommend this product, and I wish I hadn't purchased it. It wouldn't be worth it at $2, it certainly wasn't worth it at $16. Ouch."
3,Noise Canceling Microphone? I doubt...,"I saw the reviews and took the microphone for my laptop. Although I am not sure about the noise cancelling tech the mic uses. however i tested the mic with music in the background and mic on my shirt. My wife was outdoors; she felt my voice was echoing however she could listen to the song very clearly. I connected the mic directly to the laptop; echo was gone but the song was still clear for her.SO i believe its not a noise cancelling microphone, but i like the options of connecting it directly to the laptop or your shirt.I would recommend this mic for general use, or maybe some one can explain how the noise cancelling works for this mic and i might update the review.Happy Amazoning..."
3,not sure where the noise canceling was,"I am not sure I get the noise canceling effect after I use this mic.I am using this exclusively on the new iPad which I have to say has a great built-in mic.I really couldn't tell the difference in before and after results of using this mic.The only difference being that it has an extension cord which I can bring it closer to the person or thing I am recoding; but other than that, I really couldn't tell if the ambient noise is reduced.A bit disappointing.But overall, this is a versatile recording add-on mic which can be clipped to the collar to have better pick up of the speaking.Since it records in mono, I don't recommend using this to record anything other than lecture or speaking engagements."
4,Awesome Microphone,This little thing works great! I like the fact that it swivels and is small enough to not get in your way. Works great.
1,Didn't work at all,"When I plugged this mic into my computer it did not work at all. Instructions are nearly nonexistent but all you should have to do with a plug in mic is plug it in and when I did, nothing happened. I'm very disappointed."
1,not very good,when i got the microphone it didn't even work.....i checked everything with my computer settings and everything with it was fine.
1,Piece of Crap,"Last me exactly one year. Now it will not record when bended 45, or 90 degrees. Most likely the contacts are dirty, or rusty, but there is now way to clean them."
2,Does not work with iPod Touch,"I own an iPod touch. ""Why would I need another digital recorder?"" I thought. There are apps for recording on the ipod. I should just buy a microphone. Only the touch doesn't recognize this microphone as being a microphone. This may be a great microphone with an olympus recorder, I do not know. I only know that it does not work with my ipod."
2,Mono mic is practically useless with any modern device,Can only be used with a device that is about 20 years old. Mono microphones are useless these days. Period.
3,Works Fine,"I bought 2 of these, and gave one to my father-in-law, so we could Skype on Sundays.The sound is not spectacular, but it works, and the price is right."
3,Not great for what I bought it for,"I bought this to replace the crappy Garmin Mic for use with my Bluetooth GPS. I figured that this was supposed to be a decent quality mic, and with the added noise cancelling capability, it should work well in the car. Oh well. Turns out, a cheap computer mic I had lying around the house worked better. I first noticed it wasn't living up to par when a few of my callers were telling me they couldn't hear or understand me, so I did a direct comparison switching it back and forth with the computer mic and there was a clear winner. The computer mic. So back this goes. I was told it made me sound under water, and the noise cancelling was negligible"
2,NOOOOOOOOOO THANKS!!,"I ordered this product for the Kodack Zi8 camcorder to ""improve"" the poor mic quality and hoped this would do it but sadly I must say IT DIDN'T. I adjusted and tweeked it but nothing helped, the mic in the camera was better than this added one. This mic might work well with another type of recording machine but not this camcorder so I don't recommened it for the Kodak Zi8."
1,Doesn't cancel the noise!,"This mic is not what I expected it to be. I really thought it would work for my class lectures, but I still hear loud noise and I sit on the first row!!"
1,It's not working!,Does not work with my iphone 4s! The site had not been warned that the microphone does not work with iphone 4s!
4,Pretty good mic for the price,"I have a little Olympus digital recorder and needed a mic to attach to it to get better audio quality. Since I'm a student journalist, this absolutely perfect for me. It's small, economical, and works great to get the interviews you need whether it's in person or through the phone. I wouldn't recommend using it during conferences unless you are interviewing the individuals personally. It's easy to use and it's great for now until you can save up money for a professional recorder."
4,Good for the price you get but still a little grainy,"The mic is good for the price you get it at but it is still a little grainy when you play back your recording. It is particularly sensitive to touch so you have to hold the mic deadly still so that you don't hear your fingers handling the mic. This is the case even when your fingers are as far away from the receiving end of the mic as possible.You can of course make the quality better by putting it through a program such as Audacity, but that still requires a lot of filtering.You should also be careful when recording as it likes to pick up strong P's and S's. But you get that with pretty much any voice recorder."
5,Great Pick-up,"I got my little mic in a very prompt delivery, and immediately got to put it to use at one of my meetings that I am secretary of and it picks up voices and sound just great even from persons speaking from the back of the room some 20 or 30 feet away. I use it being connected directly into my recorder. Would greatly recommend using this little gadget."
4,Satisfied,"I have not yet fully tested this item. However, up to this point I have not found anything to complaint about. Thanks."
4,Good mic!,1st of all ITS A LOT SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED!!! this mic is TINY but the mic sound very good on youtube vids...Overall its working GREAT!!!
4,"Mono sound, but good quality","For how cheap it was, was a good microphone. The noise cancellation NOT works, but at least he tries."
3,Looks cool but no love in IBMs,This microphone did not work in my IBM R50e since it was not a stereo mic.I ended up returning this and collected a refund. Put that money toward a new laptop with an onboard mic.
1,recommended to by amazon but WAIT,"I returned this product, it was recommended by amazon for me to buy with the VN8100PC and TP-7 phone recorder but guess what you cannot use TP-7 and this item on the digital recorder at the same time, hello?? You would think someone might mention that. Needless to say I returned the device."
1,noise cancelling micrphone for personal use,I plan to return this product as it was only after reading the insert that I learned that it was for personal use not for recording a committee meeting.
3,Okay..,"I think this works okay. I do not agree that it is noise canceling as people said they could hear background noise still, but overall it's okay."
3,"Works great with Olympus recorders,not with anything else.","i like the shape of this mic, and I would give it 5 stars but it didn't sound to good on my sony or my Phillips recorders."
3,Mono only,I ordered this not realizing it would be mono only. Only one speaker plays back what you record. It's not what it's cracked up to be.
4,"decent microphone, low price",It doesn't actually cancel out much noise but it is decent on pick up. With a little sound editing you can cut out the background noise and make it work.
4,Good for the price,"I use it for recording lectures in law school. Significantly better than the built in mic in my laptop, however it doesn't blow me away. It seems like I had gotten better results with a cheapo mic designed for using with a webcam that I used last semester."
5,Olympus ME-52W Microphone,THIS MICROPHONE IS AWESOME! WORKS GREAT AND RECORDS CLEAR! I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT! WORKS PERFECT ON MY GOPRO HD 2! =)
5,Working normally,"The reception of sound is good. Not much noise and simple to use. Just plug it and use it. Not very high-end, but good enough for me."
1,Don't Buy This,"For the price, it looks and feels cheap. Plus it does not pick up sound well. Trust me on this. I regret buying this. You will too."
1,This thing absolutely sucked.,"Wish I didn't have to give this one star, but I do.I tried recording an entire lecture that my professor gave at school, and I was sitting right in the front, with this microphone (or lack of) plugged into the device. When I went to listen to it later, all there was was static, I mean SO much static that you literally couldn't hear a THING. WASTE OF MONEY and very disappointed that I didn't get that recorded!"
2,Functionality With Laptop(Mac Book Pro)??,"I have just received my Olympus ME 52 - Microphone, but it does not work with my Mac Book Pro. I assumed there would be no problem using the product with a laptop? I would be sincerely grateful if somebody could give me some advice on this?? as I have a very important interview tomorrow"
2,Should not buy this with the Sony ICD_UX200 Digital voice recorder,"This is thing work fine with the laptop or what ever it is, but I don't recommend for the Sony ICD_UX200 Digital voice recorder as Amazon recommend. This thing only work on one side for recording from Sony ICD_UX200 Digital voice recorder. When I hear the record, the right sides is not work at all. I just figure out the different in output of this microphone, the look different compare to the SOny Product. I don't know how it does not work but it did not at all."
5,WOW,"When i first heard that there was an album that had all the good songs in it, but flushed out the words, I was all in for it. I admire Dave and his voice, but I was always into Megadeth because of the great guitars and music. This was damn right amazing. I suggest that not just Megadeth fans, but those who're into guitar music, listen to this awesome album. I wish they coul do more, instead of seclude it as an import release. Megadeth at their best...."
3,Newcomer's Handbook for Atlanta,"This might be a better book for those moving to Atlanta with children and buying a home. It gives information on utilities and mail services, child care, schools, finding a place to live, money issues, etc. These are all things that are useless if you have already moved into an apartment and have no children. About half of the book had valuable information such as short getaways, annual events happening in Atlanta, recreational activities, churches, cultural opportunities and shopping."
1,Trevor-Roper a joke!,"No one should ever purchase this book or ANYTHING from this author. Hugh Trevor-Roper was a history hack, a poor writer and a terribly flawed researcher with more opinions (wrong, of course) than brass tacks. A travesty."
1,"Even the CD interface, itself is buggy! (fatal error)","The first thing I did when I got this book was to pop in the accompanying CD to find an annoying bug: the main window allows the user to resize and hide the button to continue. Minor annoyance? Maybe, but read on, it gets worse.Next, I choose to click the button that (supposedly) copies the files from their cd to my hard drive, and it crashes and dumps me out of their program. These guys can't write the rudimentary code to copy files, but they're supposed to teach me something? (but wait, there's more)After manually copying the cd, I opened their first example program from chapter 2 (CD player). The stop button acts erratically, and is generally buggy.I have to admit that I didn't go much further. If they can't check their work past this, they don't deserve my money. No more ""Jamsa Press"" books for me."
2,"Confusing, inconsistent, and too often wrong","The book promises to be a great help for whatever programming objective one might have. However, the repetitive style of the book soon becomes annoying for the experienced coder, the theory describing the code not always corresponds to the actual code, many variables are declared and are not used, some described methods for working with forms are not correct (for ex., drag-and-dropping to move controls into frames), too many bugs makes one spend a lot time correcting the code and, worse of all, the included CD-ROM does not have the same code as that listed in the book. Too bad, the idea of presenting a group of programming tasks to carry out common needs is great, but the book wastes this opportunity."
4,Excellent coverage of variety of subjects,The book has some really good code axamples but doesn't just stay on one topic. Good coverage of some Networking with VB. Excellent review of the code listed. One of the better VB books even for a person already familiar with VB. I have looked at many VB boks and I really like this one. Not for real basic beginner.
5,Adopted by Aliens,This is a great shapeshifters album. It was more than I expected. This album is full of deep thoughts mixed in with some great beats. I would really recommend this album to those who enjoy underground hip hop.
4,My brain just exploded.,"First I would like to say, I'm from LA and I see emcees like AWOL one and Circus rip mics up and down the Cali coast all the time. Out here our funkee and charismatic beats laced with insane lyricism is inconceivable. If your not from the Westcoast you should visit. I guarantee you will leave with a higher understanding of how deep Hip Hop can go. This album ""Adopted by Aliens"" is some of the illest, sickest, cleanest, intergalactic Hip Hop out. After listening to this album, I now know being wierd and conceptually smart is the coolest... Oh yeah, pick up ""Know Future"" which is the Shapeshifter album before this one. Go to celestialrecordings.com and check it out. curbserver.com too while your at it. Late. Rest in Peace DJ Rob One. We know your talented soul shines over us all."
3,"Pretty far out there, but decent","This is a pretty weird album... yes, indeed. The LA-based Shapeshifters Crew appears to be mostly white, and it comes out in their spaced-out, sci-fi rhymes and chasing beats. Think a step or two beyond Kool Keith's Black Elvis... that's what I'm shooting for.But there are some serious tracks on this CD. The opener, ""Who's Got Presents?"" rolls along with a slick bassline and some hilarious rhymes. ""Prevail,"" ""Reiterate"" and ""Flossin'"" are also good tracks with some nice lyrical work.Too many tracks, however, are a little too off-the-wall for this reviewer at least. Tracks with names like ""Mos Eisley,"" ""Hootie and the Brainfish,"" and ""Words of Wizdumb"" are just begging to consist of nonsensical loops and even stranger rhymes.This CD isn't underground, it's so far above ground it's in outer space. If you're a Kool Keith fan, this could be for you. For the average hip-hopper, it might be a little too far out there."
5,Classic,"This CD was an instant classic when it first came out. The Dixie Chicks know how to make a great country song and they can sure play the hell out their instruments. The fact that they are also three women doing what they do best makes the CD that much better. From songs like ""You Were Mine"" to ""Never Say Die"" the Dixie Chicks prove here that they are pure country. They have the unique ability to mix bluegrass, pop, and country all in one. With songs ranging from traditional country to contemporary country these three women have proved through and through that they have what it takes to make a great album."
5,One of the best albums I own!,"I bought ""Wide Open Spaces"" on impulse, after hearing ""There's Your Trouble"" just once on VH1. The album was an instant hit with me, and ""There's Your Trouble"" remains my favourite track. The album provides quite a wide range of music styles, although the theme throughout the CD is country. This is the sort of CD that you are always in the mood for, and although a lot of the tracks are quite sad, they are not depressing. One of the best songs on the album is ""Let 'Er Rip"" as this comes about half way through, and provides a complete contrast to most of the CD.I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves music, and it is definitely enjoyable to non-country music fans. However, if you fall in love with this CD, be wary of the follow-up CD, ""Fly"" as the Dixie Chicks style has changed dramatically"
5,Luv It!,I luv this cd. It shows the Dixie Chicks style and personality. It makes you want to dance to the beat. BUY THIS CD! IT'S AWESOME!
3,Cute country pop,"They are just so darn cute, it's hard not to like them. Infectious vocals with Natalie Maines charming the listener right from the opening number ""I Can Love You Better,"" and solid production make this a very listenable if less than memorable recording. With only one tune by members of the band, the slooow ""You Were Mine,"" you don't get a real feel for the band's point of view. Clever and catchy numbers like ""There's your Trouble"" and ""Let'er Rip"" show the band off to good advantage, but the Dixie Chicks are definitely a work in progress on their first CD."
4,A Surprisingly Good Effort,"I admire the people who put this together for trying a lot harder than they needed to. Sorry to be sexist, but they could have marketed the ladies by looks alone, given them garbage to record (with perhaps a good song or two), and milk the act as eye-candy for as long as they could.Instead, they come out with an ear-popping set that shines in all categories: songwriting, producing, singing, and musicianship. OK, it shines in album cover, also. Not only are they good to look at, they also contribute as musicians.While most of the songs are good, a great album often has at least one song that you can play over and over without getting tired of. With me, this one is ""The Heartaches on Me"". All in all, a great team effort that introduced the act to the world."
2,OK is the best word to describe this music!,"This album really doesn't have alot of depth to it. Its all about a lead vocalist and two background singers. Hardly what I would call a GROUP. The two sisters are extrememly talented musicians, but their singing is very minimal on this project. Instrumentally, the tracks feel empty. Not alot of fulness. I could think of some better ways to spend my $15!"
2,"Good for rookies, but keep trying- you'll get it right!!","Vocals are haunting,""get under your skin""-type. Banjo and fiddle are top-notch. The only thing ""The Chicks"" are lacking that would put them among the ranks of the legendary groups of all time is a strong lead vocal. The writing and musical ability are already there."
5,"Fun, fun, fun","'Wide Open Spaces' is an enjoyable album. The Dixie Chicks are so energetic and bubbly! Their music is very fun to dance and sing along to. I don't really have a favorite song on this cd because they're all good, but I really like 'I Can Love You Better,' and 'There's Your Trouble.' 'You Were Mine' is pretty, too. I'd say this is probably my favorite country album, and I'd recommend it!"
5,Dixie chicks are the best out there!,Ok people if there is one cd that you are going to get somebody this christmas it has to be the dixie chicks. They have such a beautiful sound that shows when you listen to the cd. The good thing about this cd is that the sound is diffrent unlike every other cd that might have the same sound to every song. You get a little taste of everything with everysong. I bought it and can't stop not listing to it because it just can make you being haveing a bad day and bring it up to a good day. I would have to say that if you are not going to buy this ablum then you better get your ears checked because there really is no bad thing about this cd! I love the Dixie Chicks
4,Great Cd! Twainy yet Rockin@,"The Dixie Chicks truly are one of the best new country artists that I've seen for a long time! I like a mixture of pop and country and this CD is it! I must admit that even though a few of the slow songs make me yawn I LOVE the song ""you were mine!"" That song doesn't get as much credit as it should! (hi Brian) Rock on chicks! I can't wait for the new CD this fall!"
4,"Great Country Pop -- vocals, songwriting","I'm more of an alt-country fan, so I'm suspicious of acts like the Dixie Chicks who seem to work a smaller, narrower formula of song writing. But I was standing in a Radio Shack in San Francisco on Saturday, buying a new antenna for my cell phone, and as I started to walk out, I noticed all the demo televisions were playing the video for ""Wide Open Spaces,"" and I just got mezmerized. I stood and listened to the whole thing. The singing is so strong, and when they sing that line, ""She needs wide open spaces / ""room to make her big mistakes,"" it was everything I love about country--real emotion, simply put, outside of phony formulas, major chords singing an anthem. I just wandered around the rest of the day humming the song. Now I'm back to buy the album. And isn't that experience more or less what you want music to do for you?Rohn Jay Miller"
5,WOW!!!,"What an amazing CD!!! I loved it and so does my family! The Dixie Chicks are much more talented than Britney Spears or the Backstreet Boys, plus they play their own instruments. I would have to say my favorites are 1-Wide Open Spaces 2-There's your trouble 3-You were mine 4-I can love you better 5-Give it up or let me go. Normally I am NOT a country fan, but this was great!!!!"
4,Enjoyable,Good solid song writing and orchestrations. Well executed. Very enjoyable. It's been an excellent addition on my country playlist .
5,love it,i have always loved the dixie chicks. it was easy to download to my smart phone also. thank you so much
5,wide open spaces dixie chicks,"i just love the dixie chicks and this passed weekend i reiceived 2nd place singing the dixies chicks ""wide open spaces"" the dixie chicks rule"
5,The Dixie Chicks are just plain fun,"The women themselves are as charming as this album, and it's great to see strong female talent in the male dominated field of C&W. Roll on, girls, for many more CDs!"
5,"Excellent, heartfelt, true gifted artists.","5 stars and nothing less. This album is dedicated to the ""soul"" of country music. Best song is the title track, ""Wide Open Spaces"" along with several others that you can groove to at any time. I truly enjoyed this album and hope you do too."
5,"The ""Chicks"" rule!",Dixie Chicks have so much soul. Their words speak to everyone. All of the songs on this CD kick! I hope they never stop making music.
5,Country Music at its best!,Wow! Take some of the best written country music songs and have them performed by the Dixie Chicks and you yield one awesome album. My only regret is that I did not buy this album sooner. Every song on this album is a winner and we all know that is rare. Buy this album and enjoy.
5,This CD covers all of country: from old fashioned to modern,These girls have done it! In one CD they have covered the entire genre of country. There's some blue grass type songs and some very modern songs. They have brought country to a new dimension. The amazing part is that they are so young.
5,OH YEAH,I bought this tape right after it first came out. I am going to have to buy the CD next time. The tape is already worn out.
5,This CD is the best I own.,The Dixie chicks are a very talented group of girls that shine on this album. I love the CD. It's the best one I own.
4,These chicks ain't just whistling dixie,"Leann who? Shania who? This trio combines great harmonies, strong material and excellent production while keepin it on the country side. I bought this Cd as soon as I heard the title track to ""Wide Open Spaces"" Great stuff! In ""There's Your Trouble"", noone says ""wrawng"" cuter than Natalie Maines. Who says we don't know good country music here on America's Riviera - South Miami Beach, Florida!"
4,Nice voices,"Nice voices, very well pronouncing and understandable, attractive, warm and no dominating from the accompanies! Cok van der Marel"
5,it was great,I reviewed the title Dixie Chicks and I found it very interesting to read.I'm a country music fan and I plan to review a lot more of the artist and title names here. I'm new at this and I find this whole thing great. Keep up the great work.
4,it needs to be more rock and rool. they are all really slow,IT NEEDS TO BE FASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BYE
4,A little something for everyone.,"This is a solid album, but the songs in the latter half don't compare to the first 5. Conveniently, the songs that have been released are all from the first 5 on the disc. They are good, but Twain, Hill, Yearwood, Messina etc. all remain better buys. By the way, the best song on the album, in my opinion, is ""You Were Mine."" It has excellent balance, good harmony, and a relatable message."
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!,"I love this CD! I don't like country music but this is one of my favorite CDs. It has songs you can sing-along to, dance to, or just plain listen to. I think anyone would like this CD even if they hate everything about country music. So don't miss out on one of the greatest CD's ever and get this one!"
5,Dixie Chicks put the cool back into country!!,"This is my favorite CD. I listen to it all the time. It is the funnest music to sing along with, although I am not sure why. Maybe because the words are so clear. Every single song on the album is wonderful. I have found it is music for all occasions: when you're sad or happy. My favorite song is ""Loving Arms"". It sends chills down my spine. The Dixie Chicks introduced me to the great world of country music. Although everyone laughs when I tell them I love country, it really is a great thing. I highly recommend this to people in all genres of music, because it is just great music. These are talented musicians. I hope their next album is just as good."
5,THE BEST,"This CD is simply awesome. It not only includes songs that have great beats and are fun to dance to, but it also has songs that make you really think twice. ""Could it be me?"" is what I asked myself."
2,This is more Hollywood than Austin.,"Though their songs have great story telling appeal and strong harmonizing vocals, the riffs and tunes are somewhat forgettable (with the exception of the bluesy ""Tonight's the Heartache's on me"" and the title ""Wide Open Spaces""). This is not their strongest album. Try Fly or Home for a better representation of their talent."
4,Mixed Results,"Actually, I rate this one somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. Their musical talent is obvious (Emily on dobro, banjo & acoustic guitar, Martie on fiddle & mandolin). Vocally, however, the results are hit and miss. I much prefer their slower, more melodic tunes where they can show off their great harmonies. As a result, my favorites are the title track, along with ""Loving Arms"", ""Never Say Die"", ""I'll Take Care of You"", & the mid-tempo ""Am I the Only One"". On the faster tunes, however, lead singer Natalie comes off almost like a parody of a country singer. This is most apparent on ""Let 'Er Rip"" & especially ""Give It Up Or Let Me Go"". A good effort, but could be better."
4,Wonderful Debut,"What a wonderful debut from this fascinating, and talented trio from Texas! I know of very few people who can deny how great, and how much fun this album is. The twangy vocals and guitars are a perfect match to the banjo and fiddle. You can tell that the girls have honed their skills playing for the public, yet not abandoning their background. Hats off to Martie, Emily and Natalie.Every song is so good, that I can't list just one that's my favorite."
5,It is an excellent album:),I never used to like country music until I heard the Dixie Chicks.I then realized how good country music could be.
5,Dixie Chicks make me Crow,not a bad song on the CD. Excellent Harmony. Some good picking and fiddlin.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Dixie Chicks are the absolute best in new country music. They combine an awesome harmony with great lyrics. In many albums of todays artist there are some songs that you just skip over, if one skips over any songs on this album that person will leave the album on the shelf without getting the most out of it. That person would then feel cheated out of every type of happiness."
4,Not Your Run of the Mill Country,"I tend to prefer the more pop oriented country music artists like Shania Twain. I'd heard of the Dixie Chicks, but wasn't at all familiar with their music. I was a little hestitant about buying ""Wide Open Spaces"" but I'm glad I gave it a chance. The vocals on this album just blew me away. These are songs that grab your attention and have you singing along. There isn't a song on this album I don't like. The Chicks are all very talented girls. Natalie's voice has something about it that just draws you in. You find ourself singing along to every single song. This is a very enjoyable album and recommend it to people who like more pop oriented country music. To sum it up, this album is a breath of fresh air. I hope to pick up a copy of their new album ""Fly"" soon. This is one album that will probably exceed your expectations."
5,Dixie Chicks are singing artists,They are so good.I don't like country that much but when I heard them i'm thought they were great my friend thinks so too.Buy it you'll love it!
5,"These girls are talented, beautiful, and lots of fun!","There were a few songs that I liked when my friend gave ne this CD last January. Then we went to go see them in Atlantic City on Valentine's Day and I was blown away. They sound even better in person, and they put on a fantastic show. I love the whole CD now, but my favorite song is definately 'You Were Mine.' I would recomend this CD to anyone, even if they're not fans of any country music, because I wasn't either. It's a lot of fun and hard not to like."
5,This is the best CD i have bought ever!!!!!!,"This CD has a wide variety of songs, i.e. slow, fast, medium. If you are looking for a good way to spend money on a CD, this is it!! Even if you are not a fan of country music!! I would recommend this CD to ANYONE. Every song on the CD is great and has a catchy tune that you can sing along with!"
2,Wide Open Spaces,"This CD is great country singing (I think), if you like the Dixie Chicks doing backup to Greg Morrow on drums. If you like a CD that goes ""thump"" ""thump"" ""thump"" ""thump"" for 40 minutes, on beat-after-beat, on song-after-song, then you'll love this CD. Why do arrangers have the drummer as the loudest, dominant feature? Why does Sony/Monument put the CD on the market this way?Lee Bracey, Wood Ridge, NJ"
1,Extremely disappointing,"This book has many problems. I will be sending mine back to Amazon as soon as I find my packing tape.1: The ""amulet"" itself. From the cover illustration, I figured it would be the forehead-ornament on the black feathered costume which is featured prominently. Not so: the amulet is a lump of black, with bronzey ropes across it. The amulet opens like a locket. It is the ugliest piece of plastic jewelry I've seen in a long time.2: The plot. I'd hoped that the story would be worthwhile. It is not. Amidala realizes her amulet is missing, she and a handmaiden go to look for it, they find it and return. No adventures. No uplifting tale. No additional background to the movie.The only thing worthy about this ""book"" is the box that it comes in, which is pretty and would make a fairly decent 'secret box' for a child. But those are easy to come by or to make yourself."
1,The Queen's Amulet,"This book features an uninteresting Star Wars character that was portrayed by an even duller actress, one Natalie Portman. The book was pretty good. I only wish the creative spirit was directed towards a better Star Wars character."
5,Awesome!!!,This is a beautiful Megatron Jersey a must have for any true Lions fan. I'm thinking about getting another one just to have extra.
5,Awesome!,My husband is so-ooo happy with this jersey (even though the Lions are not having a great year). It's great quality. I recommend it!
5,My Son Will Love IT!,"The size is great, we ordered a 2X, cant beet the price and i know my son is going to love it when he gets it for Christmas!"
5,Calvin Johnson Jersey,The jersey is a great product and arrived in the time limit promised. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
3,ZZZZzzz,"Okay so you want to know why I gave a funny, exciting and entertaining book only threee stars right? Well, I'll tell you why . .Applegate is running out of ideas!!! That is the only reason she would bring David back! The whole thing with him and (Oh, I won't tell you who David's working with) is pointless. It's another one of those Animorphs where you could take it roight out of the series and no one would miss it. Hey, Applegate, if you ran out of ideas you should end the series, not get people to write it for you!"
2,Not a very good choice,"The cable is thick enough, which is good. But it is also very bad: You have to strugle with it! very hard to handle.I did not like the lock. It looks nice on the web, but I have a feeling that it only needs one small hammer to smash it.My advice: try thinner cable and do not go with the key lock"
4,A Christian expert look at giving,"I have had a long time interest in giving and financial planning and have written a book ""Handbook of Spiritual Giving"". However, this book is really to the meat of motives of giving and presents methods to go about making the best decisions as to where to give and to give God the greatest glory."
1,A very Christian book,"How would Jesus manage money - give it all away. It is God's Money, to help mankind, someone has to manage it. This book does NOT tell you HOW. It does no tell how to manage your money responsibly, no description of risk management or money stewardship. There is some superficial advice like don't borrow money and contribute to your IRA. It does not tell you how to give it away or philanthropy. In short it does not tell you how to do God's work with God's Money.Rather it is about a lost soul, who realized Mammon was leading him down the wrong path, but never found a path of responsibility and philanthropy."
2,"Another ""Eagle"" end of the road","I saw this favourably reviewed elsewhere and tried it. My comments on ""Long road out of Eden"" also apply here - innocuous, often pleasant stuff, but nothing that really reaches out and grabs you (or at least me). It seems that the Eagles and their spin-offs have all reached the ends of their roads and should stick to the ""oldies"" circuit, living off past glories.P.S. I am informed by J. Wade below (thanks!) that, although this CD is recent, the recording came out 30 years ago, so the last sentence of the review may be ignored. The rest still stands."
2,LIFELESS AND UNINSPIRING,"When Leadon left the Eagles there was hope that this album might provide some stellar material that he had been unable to peddle to the band. What we got with this release was a set of boring, unimaginative and tedious tunes.Poor Bernie does not possess much of a lead voice and that is painfully exposed here without Frey/Henley/Meisner harmonies to provde cover for him. The songs never really catch fire and the whole affair is a snoozefest.In short, this album stinks out loud just as it did in 1977. Mercifully, there were no bonus tracks added to the Wounded Bird reissue. What would be the point?"
2,"Decent, but certainly not his best","You have to admire JB for trying to stretch himself musically on this album and ceratinly the lyrcis for many of the songs are compelling. But, unfortunately, it doesn't work and the effort pales in comparison with such classics as Late for the Sky, The Pretender or For Everyman."
3,A mixed bag,"Some good, some mediocre. The good: Enough of the Night, Chasing you into the Night, How Long, My personal Revenge, and Lights and Virtues. The rest, well, in my opinion not up to normal Jackson Browne standards. There's enough good to buy the CD, as I did (an inexpensive used copy), but not near his best. If you're a Jackson Browne collector, as I am, buy it, if you're new to Jackson, buy his double CD, The Very Best of Jackson Browne, or any of his first five albums, Jackson Browne (Saturate Before Using), For Everyman, Late For the Sky, The Pretender, or Running on Empty. They're all far superior, in all respects, to World in Motion."
2,"average song,but a funny video","the song itself didn't really do much for me,but the video was funny&had some cool effects.I wasn't really feeling the Groove overall.I knew where Missy&Timberland were trying to go with it but it comes a bit just kinda there for me overall.but the video is worth watching over&over again."
5,its great,"Get this product. It will allow you to connect any composite or rca sound cables to a head phone jack which standard size is 3.5 mm. I have a logitech sound system in my room and its input is a 3.5mm jack. So I can take the sound off my xbox 360 and ps3 and play it with nice speakers and a SICK 50 watt down firing subwoofer.By the way..... I'm only 14, I know my electronics like tony dungey knows his football."
3,ok but sound isnt that loud,i was planning on using this fro my xbox for gaming and listening to music but the volume is at a default level so you cant make it louder which sucks its other than that it is ok but not great BECAUSE I CANT BLAST THE VOLUME INTO MY EARS WHILE I PLAY BBC2
5,Does exactly what I need it to,I play a lot of online games on my playstation 3 and there are times where I don't want to disturb anyone with the sound coming from the tv. This lets you hear the sound from your headphones as well as be able to chat with whoever.
5,A very great deal!,"I was releived to find this product at all an even more releived by the price! I looked for a cable like this to play my PS3 without being to loud at night because my TV doesn't have a headphone jack. I couldn't find this cable anywere except for radio shack but I knew they were gonna charge me 5 times more than amazon an I was right! It was 10 bucks for a small one,! When I got it for under 3 dollars an that's with shipping! This is a handy cable to plug things in directly into headphones, even if you don't want to be quiet you can hear things better with headphones with a sounf equal to surround sound. I used to play my movies an games really quiet to not bother my sister an barely could hear anything, now I hear everything richly an nobody else gets bothered."
5,Fantastic!,"Started using it seconds out of the packaging and it has worked flawlessly ever since! Now I can blast Skyrim, Battlefield 3 and Mass Effect 3 from my Xbox 360 to my Klipsch speakers."
5,The final solution!!,"exactly what i needed to connect my turntable to my speakers...sounds great! pretty solid build quality, would say get it if you need it"
3,Monotone out the box,"Works ok, and doesn't cost much, but you have to fiddle with it to get audio to play out of both speakers. Seems like a loose wire caused by bad QC."
3,this thing is very hard to find,great product very hard to find. a little overpriced. when i have it hooked up to my ps3 and headphones sometimes the sound cuts out at loud times for a very short period of time. nothing crazy.if u dont feel like buying some crazy pair of gaming headphones and you need headphones for you stuff get these. very useful.
2,Poor Sound quality,"I planned to use this withmy Xbox 360 for christmas, so I tried it out with my Wii for now.I bought this off of Points2Shop: ([...]). When i got this in the mail and plugged it in, it sounded TERRIBLE!!!! The sound was really tinny. It wasn't the headphones because I was using really good $150 headphones (Audio Technica ATH-M50s). I will probably end up returning this.As for my Xbox 360, I found a much better way to play using headphones. I ended up hooking the audio from the AV cable into the back of my amp and used the 1/4"" headphone adapter, was able to tune down the treble a little bit, sounded way better.If sound quality isn't a major problem for you, go ahead. If your expecting to play video games with excellent sound quality, like me, this is NOT for you. Cheap, but horrible sound quality.UPDATE: I just called this morning and they refunded me already, didn't even have to send it back. 2 Star Product, 5 Star Customer Service."
1,"Slow mailing, wrong item.",The mailing is very slow. It took me weeks to receive the item. When I finally got it: its a wrong one.
3,Did I really buy this?,"I don't remember buying this, or what use I could possibly have for it. Both sides are female? Who makes this stuff? Who found my frog?Edit: This isn't that bad of a product, but until someone can tell me why I bought it, it only gets three stars."
5,ATH M50,"used them with my audio technica ath m50's sound quality is superb, not tinny at all. perfect for gaming used on xbox 360 and ps3."
3,Would have been better to know that other cords like this go both ways,"I bought this thinking that this was the only thing that could convert VGA audio to 3.5 mm, but then I found out that I was wring when I got a different cord so I could connect my laptop audio to my tv, in just 1 cord instead of 3 different cords. The product does work like it is supposed to, but it took almost a month for the package to arrive in my mailbox. If you want something like this that works, go buy a cord that doesn't take as long to ship and has VGA on one end and 3.5 mm on the other."
4,Good for those that want their consoles hooked to their headphones. No volume control though.,I really hate my TV's speakers and wanted to use my nice Sennheiser headphones with my xbox 360. This splitter works great but you will need an amp to have volume control.The volume without an amp is ok if the room is quiet enough.
2,Their ok...,Well I have finally installed these on a 2002 Ford Focus SVT. And to find out the ride is more bouncy and less stiff than the stock suspension. Only real problem with the install is the back shocks the top bolt assembly is too short. Had to modify the rubber grommet to get them to bolt up.So if you are driving a SVT and looking for an upgrade. I would say find another set of shocks \ Springs.
1,Will not install on XP systems,"I tried on two separate XP computers to install this thing, and both where no-go. I have NEVER had a problem installing ANY software on an XP system -- even 90% of ancient pure DOS software. This is junk software programming at its worst. Avoid if you have a computer newer than six years old! (BTW, all the files that I can see on the CD are from 1999 or before, so this program wouldn't have very current information anyway.)"
3,Too much extraneous background,"Interesting topic that certainly gets a thorough treatment. But the author goes back literally hundreds of years in giving context about the three families. A little context is warranted, but this seemed way overboard to me. I think the book would have been stronger without all of that extraneous history."
2,Try a closer view,"If you read this book, you must read All Souls : A Family Story from Southie by Michael Patrick MacDonald. It gives a necessary perspective on a community rarely described with accuracy. It brings greater truth to the troubled times in Boston than the Lukas book."
5,"THE TRUTH, WITHOUT BLAME","As one who actually lived through these terrible, terrible times in Boston, this book is one of the only pieces of journalism that doesn't portray white, working class Boston as the bad, ugly racists, but rather shows that the children of Boston were used as pawns by well-heeled suburbanites and a lofty judge who walked away and then pointed the finger. It was always, always about class and not race and the whole busing debacle nearly ruined a great American city. Stopping the desegregation at the City limits was the biggest mistake ever made and the people of Boston simply refused to abide by it. Sure, people were accused of being racist and certainly some ugly things happened, but to act as though discrimination ended at the borders of Boston was ridiculous, which is now acknowledged. Hopefully the suburbs will not be let off the hook again."
5,The birth of greatness,"It is not often that I find an artist who totally captures my ears and heart. Lizzie West did all of that with one single song: Chariots Rise. I heard it on the Secretary soundtrack (now out of print) and had to purchase everything else this woman had out on the music scene.Lizzie's music cannot be compared to anyone else because she is unique -- she doesn't take ""no"" for an answer and plays by her own rules. You can hear heartache and elation in her words -- each chord blends seamlessly with the lyrics to make a musical masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and buy this album (also pick up her full length, Holy Road: Freedom Songs) -- I guarantee that these two discs will not leave your cd player anytime soon."
3,hello,"Lizzie West is someone who appeared in the mid-1990s in Williamsburg. She used to play places like The Abbey when there were no clubs in this part of Brooklyn. I remember her playing guitar and singing Leonard Cohen's ""Bird On The Wire"" in the subway at Bedford Avenue. It seemed like everyone knew who she was. She was one of the unique characters on the scene with an undying vision and no reasons to change. On this EP five years later, she is still a Leonard Cohen fan. She covers ""I'm Your Man"" adequately. Apparently her beatnik gypsy and country stylings now have a home. The full record is supposed to come out soon. She sounds like a young Natalie Merchant. Hopefully the songs on the album as good as ""Family Christmas?"""
4,Great for stuffed animals,"I bought this net to hold my son's many stuffed animals. The netting is great for holding up the toys but the plastic anchors were pretty hard getting into the walls. After trying a few times, I finally left the anchors alone and decided to use the net with screws alone."
3,Not so easy to install and quality was lacking,Although the directions made it seem easy to install I had trouble getting the plastic anchors in the wall. I also had to return the first hammock I bought because the netting was ripping away from the seams. I finally got it installed and it does serve the purpose of organizing all m daughter's stuffed animals.
3,pretty small,"This toy hammock is not nearly as long as expected. I should have paid more attention to the reveiw above. Also, the picture shows a white hammock, but the one that came is blue."
2,Stretches to 7 feet?! HA!!!!,"We bought this because the area we needed to stretch it across was a mere 6 feet. Perfect! With room for slack!! When we got it home, we realized with horror that it could not reach across! So we decided to stretch it out. I bench press 250 pounds, and with my full strength, it stretched out to a whopping 5 feet, 8 inches. If you need the full 7 feet or even just 5 feet, 9 inches, DON'T waste your time!!"
2,"Good product, undesired color","I had used a jumbo toy hammock for my children's stuffed animals in our old house and, when we moved, was looking to replace it. I found this and expected one as pictured. I should have read the text further as it does say colors vary. We ended up with blue which does not work with my daughter's pink and yellow room. Great product for getting all those stuffed animals up and away but they REALLY need to have a color option."
2,Not as useful as it seemed,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of my Jumbo Toy Hammock, it was going to hold my children's stuffed animals and FINALLY get them off of the floor and into one centralized location. When we got the hammocks we found that they didn't hold very much, they were not very useful in the corner position and when we hung them from the ceiling they only held a few items. Needless to say we (both my children and I) were very disappointed. I would not recommend this product if you have more than three or four small to medium stuffed animals as it will not hold the weight. I also did not realize that it came in different colors and we received two seperate colors which did not go with the decor in the rooms."
3,Roomy but uncontrolable,"Once the pet net is acutually on the wall it's fine, but getting it there is another story...There is no hooks to determine the placement or distance which made it difficult to hang. Now that it's up it's great!! I just don't want to think about moving again and having to fight with it once more!!!"
1,This Hammock isn't WHITE!,"I learned that the hard way, the one I got is purple. I think it stinks that they picture a white one and way down below put ""colors my vary"". The hammock itself seems ok but I would have never ordered it if I knew I was going to get a hideous purple one."
2,Not quite what I expected,It hangs strangely on the wall and can hold approximately 1/64th of the stuffed animals my children have. May be useful for a very small collection of beanie babies. I was expecting something more that would help organize the mound of stuffed animals my kids have accumulated. Turns out that a garbage bag and a trip to Goodwill did the trick.
4,looks awesome,I was looking forward to actually finding an animal net to hang in the corner of the bedroom. After reading the reviews i was unsure about it. but a friend of mine had bought it for her daughter and they love it. the plastic hooks were difficult to get in the wall but that is no reason not to get it . if u can not get the hooks in simply use nails they work great. enjot your toy net.
5,"Killer, rock-solid bluegrass!","Quite simply, a stunning traditionalist bluegrass album, with a strong penchant for country-ish heartsongs. The picking, singing and song selection are all fabulous; every song on here really leaps out and draws you in. Highly recommended... One of my favorite bluegrass albums of 2002!"
4,mia found,"I wish I could write a review, but this item is stuck in Phoenix. so ask the people there, as each and everyone must have watched my dvd in the last 10 days..hooray UPS just delivered my replacement item overnight..thanks to customer service..ok 1st of all this is a porno with money shots..the girls in the nazi movie are good looking. The mad Dr and his assistant are funny. dont waste your time on the soft core flicks in this genre..watch this one//have not seen B side yet..tbc"
3,It was a new start,"So Much For Fair Weather-Kamilla's second album, this time with a new singer. Jason is gone, and Johnny is in. Over-all the album was a success, but not as much as their first. Their music changed from a hard-metal rock, to an alternative rock, something that change their fan base. ""All Your Sins and All Your Lies, They Will Be Judged Tonight!"" Their lyrics are still awesome, but the sound, just isn't what ""Kamilla"" is known for."
5,Very useful little book,"I've often thought it would be great to have a dictionary full of verbs in their conjugated forms. Spanish students (like myself) run across unknown irregular verbs in their conjugated forms but can't look them up because verbs are only listed in dictionaries and verb books by their infinitive form. For a (simple) example, take ir (to go). A beginner student might run across ir's yo form, ""voy"", and wonder what it means. He'd be hard pressed to find it in a dictionary by that, though. Then I ran across this book in the library. It lists ""2,243 irregular Spanish verbs, 34,550 irregular verb forms, 40,500 definitions, and 4,850 regular verbs arranged alphabetically..."", and is incredibly useful. I can't believe it's out of print, but I see there are still some cheap used copies out there. If you're learning Spanish on your own and are trying to push yourself by reading higher-level Spanish texts, this book is excellent."
5,Ironsides is on the case,"This is a show I always watched as a kid in the sixties. When the first season came out on dvd, I was prepared for disappointment, was I misremembering how good it was. It was better than I recalled. The only thing that dates this show are hair and clothing styles. The plots are every bit as good now as then. The ensemble of actors gathered here make these characters their own. Leading the way is Raymond Burr. Just when you thought he might be typecast as Perry Mason, he is Chief Ironsides. Expect a nicely wound plot with a twist or two along the way. This is great entertainment."
5,Classic entertaining Rap music!,"This is my kind of ""hip hop""!! I give it a Rating of 6+ . Where is he now, I'd like to know...? Thank You, MC Rell, you rock[ed] with the best of them back in the day!! I hope you're enjoying the grandkids! And, that you have no more holes in your pocket! :-)"
4,A useful DVD for a beginner,"This DVD by the Homestead Blessings ladies would be very good for a person who is just starting to sew.However, I have been sewing for a long time and I bought it for the instructions about making a ""rag style"" baby quilt. That in itself is worth the price of the DVD. So easy to make and they are very cute."
5,Cute toy for 3-18 mos,"I got Taylor to replace a 6month-olds favorite Tiny Love turtle that got eaten by the dog. This toy is bigger than I expected it to be (too big for a baby to be able to grasp well), but a very cute toy. The baby loved the noises Taylor makes, the bright colors, the soft fabric, and its funny shaped head with those huge eyes.The head and legs on the toy are not floppy, they keep the form shown in the picture.The toy is very durable, the only drawback being it is difficult to clean, as you can't put it in the washing machine.I would definitely recommend this toy for babies because it's cute and they love the noises it makes, plus the fact that Tiny Love makes great fun and educational toys for very young children!"
5,Best Folk Children Album around,"I give this as a gift to all new parents- And sing along with ""Little Hands"" and ""I love my little Girl"" everynight with my daughter (age 7). Beautiful and touching lyrics go straight tot he heart- and put children straight to sleep.Highly recommended from a lifetime fan."
3,Fury of Achilles,The Movie itself is very good. The acting is not bad. The problem I have is that there has to be a master of this movie some where that is cleaner than the versions of this movie that I have seen. This copy is better than the one issued by Alph Home Entertainment. Hopefully some where out there some one will digitally remaster this movie and release a clean version.
1,outdated and useless,"I was also extremely disappointed with this book, it's not inspiring at all.Most of the looks you found in this book, will make you look fat, and old.And to give you an example of the advices given "" Holiday and special occasions, page 113 : ""purse : a small, simple bag in a complementary color will provide enough room for powder and lipstick"" or ""stockings: go bare unless the temperature is below zero, you can get away with naked legs for one night"", I don't really get how this is helping me in dealing with my new body."
3,Clever idea - reasonably jolly execution,"The principle is this : The entire book is written in the form of letters, log-book entries, and inter-office memos. The story is of the eponymous Hipploytus Brandenberg and his Insurrection (or his 'plans' as he calls them). Brandenberg works at an insurance company where he not only fails to do any work, but claims he is being harrassed by his seniors for being Jewish. He puruses this false claim with alacrity. Meanwhile, he is in communication - seemingly innocently - with a whole host of interesting and shady figures (Communists, Terrorists, Agents of Foriegn Powers) et al. - this incurs the attention of the CIA. And all the while he is continuing with his 'plan' - to have a hunger-strike march with thousands of the starving parading in New York. Not a bad book."
5,The Insurrection of Hippolytus Brandenberg,"This is absolutely the most influential book in my life. Superbly written! You find yourself sympathizing with poor Hippy (at least, I did!). And those suspicions you had that the CIA was following you? This book confirms it as true. This book ws supposed to be made into a movie, but I don't think it ever was. This is truly an awe-inspiring book. Read it! Read it! Read it!"
1,Good content but badly written,"Writing style is difficult to follow. Authors use acronyms that were not previously defined, there are syntactical errors (eg p. 338 ""If a frame received at a peer from a remote peer is larger than that capable of the end station to handle""), and their whole approach is too abstract. Their configuration examples are also badly explained (eg they don't state clearly that in an RSRB over TCP configuration you have to define the local peer in the same way as a remote peer).For configuration examples the online documentation at cisco.com (especially the technical tips) is infinitely superior. The only use I found for the book was in Part I, which is a (superficial) introduction to SNA technology."
1,Disappointed,I looked forward to making cakes in this pan. I tried twice baking a cake and it would not release out of the pan. Even after greasing and flouring the pan.
5,Excellen Bundtform,This is the best bundtform I have ever used. I made regular and gluten free bundtcake in it and both came out perfect. When it was done I just flipped the form upside down and the cake just fell out.Even though it's made out of aluminum it is a little bit heavy.
2,"they start out great, but after a few uses start to stick","Not sure why, but way too expensive to be only able to use 5-6 times with cakes coming out perfectly. Otherwise, bits here and there stick and ruin the beautiful look of the cake. And its definitely not that i'm not greasing it enough!"
5,great quality pan,I bake a lot and this pan is great. I would definiely recommend it to anyone looking for a different bundt pan.
2,Titles are deceiving,"Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness. Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child. Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and may push those with ""normal"" kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem."
3,GT Plus not as functional as T280,"GT Plus does everything the T280 does, but it is much harder to switch frequencies & channels. The T280 is a much better product at a lower price."
1,nebraska disappoints on this one,"Nebraska has produced some great acts in the past, bright eyes, azure ray, desaparecidos, cursive, etc....Too bad they gave us these guys too. The album sounds like it was written by 12 year old girls in need of a hug. I hope this is not indicative of the future bands from Nebraska. If so, I would say that towns 15 minutes has passed already.If they would stop trying to sound so emo maybe they could write a song with a decent hook instead of droning romps with hooks obviously stolen straight from sunny day real estate and the pixies."
3,Marginal at best,"The Vow was very predictable. A newly married couple gets in car accident, she loses memory and doesn't know him. His quest is to win her back. The viewer knows the end immediately. No drama, no suprises, very few laughs. I was disappointed, dull, dull, dull."
5,So Sweet/Sad,Ahhhh I loved this movie! I loved how he tried to get his wife back but was okay with her not remembering him...I think Rachel McAdams and Tanum did a wonderful job in this movie. :)
3,Product as described,"Product was as described. I didn't care so much for the movie though. I didn't understand why everyone I knew that had seen it ""cried the entire time."" I didn't even shed a tear."
4,Slightly disappointed:(,As much as I LOVE Channing Tatum I had a really hard time watching this movie. I had read the book before watching the movie and had hoped the movie would be as good as the book. The only thing the movie had in common with the book was the fact that the couple were in a car accident and that the wife lost her memory. Other than that the movie did not follow the book at all. Hence the four out of five stars rating. Tatum is just so darn good looking and I wanted to really like this movie but I couldn't. Read the book first!!
1,Not REALLY based on a true story...,"Yes, some lady in Indiana had amnesia and eventually married her former beau. That is where the ""based on a true story"" ends. The Vow decides to make our young couple hipsters living in a Chicago loft. He is a disc jockey and she is a claymation artist. McAdams, despite what some have said, really is annoying in this film. Her character makes you want to slap her out of her brain fart and back into reality. Tatum seems like a nice guy trying to rekindle the flame but she keeps acting weird about it.This is not a ""chick flick"". This is a stupid flick. Give women some credit. I laughed when McAdams went flying through the windshield in super slo-mo. That's how bad this one was. And I am a big fan of the Notebook. The only good film McAdams has ever done. I actually would have enjoyed a chase scene through an airport. At least it would have brought some life to this sad sack of celluloid."
1,Filth NOT a Family friendly movie!!,"This movie is NOT a Family friendly movie. There is cursing and nudity. After about fifteen minutes we took the DVD out, cut it up and threw it out!"
3,Just ok.... Watch 50 first Dates Instead,"ok... Just let me say the movie doesn't start off bad... They could have made this movie better. The Movie has some interesting loops, but highly predictable. THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLE!!!!!!! I AM NOT SPOILING ANYTHING, BUT THEY NEVER SHOWED SO MANY THINGS! WHAT ABOUT HIS MUSIC CAREER? WHAT HAPPENED?! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRIED TO LIVE THEIR NEW LIFESTYLE?If you want to watch an AMAZING movie, buy or rent 50 first dates. This movie will have you crying laughing and crying sadly.It has the same basic plot but in 50 first dates there are some minor differences, involving him trying to make her fall in love with him everyday. YOU WILL LOVE IT IT IS SET IN HAWAII.if u are interested here is the plotHenry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day."
3,Nice to know its a true story ...,"If the characters were not these two amazing actors, the movie would have not been very good.They definitely knew what they were doing when they put these two together.All in all i guess you get what you expected.Wouldn't watch again."
2,Bad Condition,"I ordered this movie as a gift for my boyfriend's sister. She loves sappy love stories. However, the movie arrived in a case that was cracked on the bottom. The paper in the cover was warped at the top, as if it had been wet. And the movie had quite a few light scratches on it. The movie skips around a little, which was slightly annoying. I won't be returning it because it was so cheap and not worth the trouble, however I am very disappointed with the condition of this movie and case."
2,A little on the sad side,"The movie is more sad than happy. There are cute moments, but overall don't expect a rom-com since there isn't much ""com"" involved. If you're looking for a good, sad love story... this would do."
2,Book is much better!,"I saw the movie before I read the book and thought the movie was okay. Your typical romance movie where love prevails all.Then I read the book. The book is so much better! Much Much better and I'm appalled at the changes that the producers and directors made. The only thing that the book and movie have in common are that a man and women were in love. They got in a car accident and the woman loses her memory of her husband. Which is a good story! I just wish they wouldn't have ""connected"" it with the book. Then it wouldn't be so annoying.If you want to see the movie rent it. Don't buy it. Or just never read the book."
2,Average,"I was looking forward to this movie, because when I read the premise, it held a lot of promise- however it was just very average. There is little intensity in this, it's just sort of bland. This is basically a nice love story, but there's nothing outstanding about it, nothing that grips or hooks the viewer. I didn't care about any of the characters. The ending is also anti-climatic. Overall, if you're in the mood for an average movie, then this is the movie for you. I found it forgettable."
4,Blu-ray rating,Not really sure as this was a gift. The story is kind of sad but I think she liked it.
3,It's OK!!!,"The dvd "" The Vow ""came a head of time,and was in very good condition. My only problem with it is that I have trouble playing it on my Blu-ray player. I can play it straight thru,but I can't pause it or rewind it. I'm not sure what the problem is. The Blu-ray player is new."
5,The Vow,It was beautiful. I've never been so touched by a story. I loved it. Channing Tatum never fails to impress.
4,So-So . . .,"Interesting plot and compelling, but just not as good as I thought it should be. I wanted that ""Notebook"" feel and was left wanting."
2,I didn't like the movie,"I sold it back to amazon, It was too much hipe and when I've watch the movie I just didn't like, it wasn't my cup of tea."
2,Movie-the Vow,"I bought this movie with high expectations, but was quite disappointed. It very much secularized which in the book was a beautiful true story of a Christian couple's commitment to their marriage vows in spite of tragedy. No mention of God was mentioned in the movie. Also in the movie the man does ultimately divorce his wife in spite of his resolve to stay true to his marriage vows. The movie was very different than the book. I would recommend the book but not the movie."
3,The Vow,I was disappointed in the nudity in the movie and also some of the language.The theme was very good. I would have very much enjoyed it if the there had been no nudity and vulgar language in it.
5,good movie,I haven't ever had any problems downloading movies from amazon and love it. The movie was good. I enjoyed watching it with my girls.
4,The Vow - sweet!,"Okay, this is a chick flick. Gotta just get that out of the way. McAdams and Tatum have decent chemistry together and make this story believable. This movie IS based on a true story - which makes you really think, if you lost your memory and ** number of years like that time never existed and the last thing you remembered was that you were dating/engaged to someone else, how it would make you and the people you love feel to basically leap back in time?I think they could have delved even more deeply into the story of this couple, but it is a movie and unfortunately there are time constraints and you can't always get everything you want!!All in all, good movie with good actors and makes you think... or if you just want entertainment you can watch it for that also even though it is sorta the normal 'romance' type story all in all."
1,Gah!,"Well to start off (bear with me on this one) the whole incident was HER FAULT!!!!!! She was the one who felt like getting it on in a CAR in the middle of the ROAD during WINTER in CHICAGO and its SNOWING!!!!! HELLO! snow plows, trucks, cars, its SLIPPERY on the roads and your lights are OFF on your car! DUH! Go somewhere and do it! Also, seriously the guy took all the heat for this! He SUFFERED for her and she basically walks away from him during most of the movie!! Gah! And the ending? What happened to that? I realize that that was probably how it all went down, but seriously, if you want people to actually like your movie then put them back together in the end!! Seriously happy that I rented this movie."
3,Not bad...not great,"Acting was good, story was good, ending was not so good.. Not as good as the notebook, but then again not as bad as Dear John."
3,dissapointed,"This movie was should have been an emotional rollercoaster. Instead it just hung there, then left us frustrated that you spent 13$ on a video we will never watch again, and our time. We need to be more careful hollywood."
1,No Chemistry,"I am glad I waited to rent this movie... No chemistry between the leads, and they both were very mopey and unbelievable. Do not watch this expecting it to be like the Notebook, you will be disappointed."
3,So so,this wasnt what i epected but it was a pretty good movie. I love both mcadams and tatum so for me it was a good watch.
4,Cute,Like the movie but the Notebook was way way better. Glad I saw it at home instead of the movie theater.
4,"great the first time, and the second time as well",Bought this because when i went in for a brain surgery my husband's fear was the premise of this movie. Plus how could you not love Rachel McAdams?;
5,Great acting,"We need more movies like this...loved it!,,,The main characters have great chemistry. Hope they are together again in another movie."
1,Disapointed,"Same as above.....charges were astronomical......wish we had never gotten involved with the purchase of these movies. Thought it a great idea until I discovered that my ""shipping free"" did not apply. When I tried to cancel, I found that each order of movies was not on one order but many and therefore, my credit card reflects over a hundred dollars. Not worth it. Never again...."
1,horrible,This movie was HORRIBLE! I was about to pull my hair out! It was like a breath of fresh air when it ended! I believe the man should have just given up on her and got on with it! The movie was VERY long and most of it was boring with little action and a bunch of scenes that could have beem omitted!
3,My girl rented,Again my girl rented this movie and she loved it. She asked me to add to our collection so I did. I will eventually watch it with her .
3,vow,Deffinitly a chick flick. Disbite channing tatum being very believeable as a husband who losses his wife to amnesia who then makes her fall for him again just seams like another run of the mill love story.was I don't think the female lead Rachel mcadams did a convincing job as well as she could have done. Therefore three stars seams suffice. Thank you still a good moviebut not great.
4,I liked it,"I went and saw this movie with my beautiful fiancee and I enjoyed it...even more than she did. She praises The Notebook and Titanic. Those were good too. I liked The Vow a smidge more than Notebook. But hey, I don't mind going against type because most would disagree. I liked the story of true love severely tested here in a way that you don't see often. How hard would it be if the love of your life forgot who you are and you could lose that person? I felt the pain of that. This isn't a genre that I have tons of favorites in. Like Horror and comedy, romantic movies have to be really special for me to like. Was this perfect? Maybe not. But I didn't think The Notebook was either, but it did the job. Also, I'm not one that is afraid to admit liking a movie like this amid all the gratuitous sex, graphic violence and raunch trash that gets churned out nowadays. Many have lost respect and chasteness, and it reflects."
2,Phony cheese,"Everything felt fake and hollywoodified throughout this movie. From the scenes, to the acting, to the makeup, I just could not enjoy this movie because of it."
2,"If you have seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie.","At the end of the day, this movie is what it is. If you are expecting romantic greatness then you've come to the wrong place, because most of ""The Vow"" is very love story paint-by-numbers. But if you are looking for a fluff-piece to get you though Valentine's Day, because your significant other forgot to plan a nice dinner, then ""The Vow"" may be what you are looking for. In a nutshell, the main reason why ""The Vow"" is a subpar romantic movie is simpler than just ""the acting was bad"" or ""the dialogue was poorly written"". In a nutshell, ""The Vow"" doesn't work simply because not for one minute was I invested in any of the characters on-screen. And that is the kiss of death for any romantic film."
2,Frustrating Movie,"We watched this movie last night and feel that it was frustrating at best. The ""bad guys"" were too bad and the ""good guy"" always came up too short. While some true stories are interesting, they do not make good movies. This is one of them.David Young Parker"
3,"Good movie, not a waste of money","It was a good movie, not bad because the actors are not bad.The only thing that is enraging and makes you angry is the way the story went. Both my husband and I were sooo upset at how Paige ended acting in the story. In the end it ends okay but it's still like...""argh are you kidding me?!"". Very surprised it's based on true events....Good to watch, wont buy on dvd for sure, but dont regret renting it either."
4,jmcwdc,It was a great movie. that life happens to all and to be able to rebuild from scratch is amazing thing.
1,Worst movie ever,"Horrible movie, I couldn't even finish it. It was slow, boring, and predictable. If you have seen the trailer you have seen the movie."
4,good but ended to soon,i liked some of the details and the twist... finding out that the guy was even a more noble guy than you thought. but still i kind of hoped to find out a bit more about the positive side of the story about things progressing... felt like it ended to soon.
4,Loved it,It took me a long time to finally watch this movie. It was worth the wait. The Vow was funny and sad at the same time but the story line was great. I love movies based on true stories because it helps remind me that true love can happen
3,Disappointed in the movie,"There was nothing wrong with the product but I was disappointed in the story line. I think it could have been better done. It's like a movie from the 60's when acting wasn't as good. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have rented it instead of buying it."
2,What a huge disappointment....,"This film truly was a huge disappointment. I was just expecting so much more. I spent half the movie wanting to go through the screen and smack her parents. And then the reason that she didn't talk to them, ARGH! I just expected this movie to make me feel good and to make me happy. And it didn't. Rent it folks, don't waste your money buying it."
2,More a drama than romantic or comedy,"I'm really perplexed why this movie is considered a romantic comedy. It is not particularly romantic or comedic. This is no ""When Harry Met Sally"". This movie would have been a flop if it was not for Rachel McAdams. She is a fabulous actress. Its too bad she has been typecasted for these so called romantic romcoms. Tatum Channing is woefully miscast. He is flat as a distressed husband trying to deal with his wife's disability. I think Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds would have been better choices."
2,Dull,"My best friend loves ""The Notebook"" and kept commenting that she wanted to see ""The Vow."" So for her birthday I downloaded it for her, and we watched it together. I had heard the true story a few years ago, so I thought it would be interesting, but we were both terribly bored with this movie. I like both of Adams and Tatum, but overall this movie seemed like it was made for Lifetime Television. I feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this in the theater."
5,The Vow,"This was an amazing story, because it was based on a true event. The sweetness and staunchness of his love for his wife, even when she couldn't remember him at all was touching. I think it would have been better without the nudity--more adaptable to younger audiences."
3,DVD Purchase,"The case came cracked, which was not mentioned. Slightly disappointed with my purchase. I have not watched the movie yet, but I am hoping it plays ok."
2,Not what I thought!,I knew what i was etting when i got this but i had just finished the book so when i watched this I was so dissapointed they cut out soooo much stuff i mean i know movies usally do that ut this one was one of the worst i felt that it was so sgort and did not portray the story very well. Could of have more detail and it got to the most vital parts to quickly.
4,Nice story,This was a nice story and we need that now days. Saw the real people on Today show and they said it was all pretty close to the exact story.
5,This was a sweet and loving movie.,I recommend this movie to everyone. This has a great plot and sweetly made. You can see the real connections between the actors.
5,THE VOW,THE VOW WAS VERY GOOD AND HEART WARMING AND SOMETIME A TEAR GERKER... BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO FAMILY AND FREINDS... AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THESE AVALIABLE.....
3,wasn't what i thought,It was a good movie but nothing like i thought it was gonna be. I thought it was gonna be a great love story but instead i just kept getting upset about how some of the stuff happened. And i didn't like the way it just ended...
3,"He Farted. Gross. The Flick's Not As Bad As You'd Think, But Almost","I had read a lot of bad stuff about this flick. The only reason I watched it was because Jessica Lange dropped in and saved the day as only she can do.What's-his-name and The Notebook girl were good, to be honest. Seriously, though...the fart scene? That's just plain laughable, out of place, and ridiculous. I'm not a prude by any means...but that was just nasty. Ruined the moment. RUINED it."
3,It Needed More Thought,"I read Deary's Books and I think it was one of the worst of his books. He pretty much didn't put as much thought into this one as the others. Mr. Deary, work up to your standards, please. I'm getting another book of yours and I hope it's better."
5,Oracle of d'Elfness,"This is a pretty pared down d'Elf outing, mostly a quartet, but the front line of Tronzo's sometimes ""prepared"" guitar and Maneri's versatile electric viola makes for a wide-ranging, very engaging sound palette in which keyboards, or anything else for that matter, are not missed at all. Fabulous stuff and a steal at 10 bucks on iTunes, though $20 for a double CD sure isn't bad either."
5,There's No Justice in the Music Biz,"As if we needed more proof that there is no justice in the music biz the fact that this absolutely wonderful album never became popular is proof enough by itself! I have loved this for years and would gladly pay 10 times the current asking price if I didn't already have it (since I'd rather have it than all 10 if the current top sellers...).I would put this in the light rock category. There is a female singer with a great voice. The song lyrics are also great! If I were to compare them with any other similar groups, they would be Toronto and maybe Quarterflash.So, do yourself a favor and get this while you still can. I'm surprised that there any still available since it has been out of print for quite a while."
2,This book not for higher levels of entry tests,"I used for preparing for Orange County Comm Coll, NY assessment tests. They offered four levels of testing...This book says for 'intermediate algebra, trig and precalc' but found for my intermediate testing level at OCCC, the practice to simple since tests questions next level of complication. Not taking Math for awhile, I did not have sufficient review for parabola, complex binomials that were asked on the test."
2,'tssss ok,"I really liked all Nuby products so I decided to give this one a try. So far, I'm not crazy about it. The material feels very flimsy and cheap, and it's not squeeze like other nuby products. What I did like are the soft spout - my baby can drink from it (although a lot of liquid comes out and sometimes he can't handle it); it's easy to clean (wide top) and I like the lid that comes with it. The one con is that it's just like any other sippy cup so I think I could have saved a couple of bucks and time to have it shipped. I could have bought one at my local grocery store!My baby is only 6 months old and still can't manage to use it on his own so please read more reviews before you make your decision! I haven't fully used it yet."
2,color,"even though color may vary,allow customers to choose what color they want.i am very much dissatisfied because i got a pink and i have a boy."
2,Leaky and spout collapses,"This cup is awful. I bought it at a local store because I thought it was the Super-spout cup (which I like a lot), but this cup is terrible. The entire top and spout collapse when my son drinks out of it because the small vent holes do not work, and the cup leaks because it is hard to align the removable soft silicone spout part with the screw-on top/handle piece. If I could return these cups I would - they are the worst. The best thing I can say for them is that they are easy to clean."
2,LEAKS!!,"My 8 month old took to this nipple very quick..like 10 minutes quick, unfortunately this sippy cup leaks like crazy.I thought maybe I wasn't closing it tight enough, but I give it all I have and it still leaks :( I'm sorry I bought these and unfortunately will be buying different ones tomorrow."
2,"Leaks, leaks, leaks!","It's not a bad cup, and easier to clean than the Nuby straw cup, but you cannot use it in bed. During the day, it's fine. But I usually put my little one to bed with some water in a sippy cup. After 3 mornings of completely sopping sheets (and a screaming baby), we had to give up on using this one for bedtime. Back to the Nuby straw cup, which works nicely."
1,Opening very large,My daughter had a hard time with this cup... the opening is very large and she would choke on the water because it came out too fast. I would go with the NUK beginner sippy cups.
2,Good for about 2 months,"One of our friends had given my son one of these cups while we were on vacation. The nipple is latex like a bottle and he had to bite down on the nipple to drink from it. It was great for about the first two months, then the little things in the nipple that control the flow managed to break and now the flow is way too fast for him and he decides that the cup is better to water his toys than to drink from."
1,Leaks!!!!!!!!!!,"This is supposed to be a LEAK proof cup....NOT! My daughter had water all over herself from it leaking. No matter how tight I tighten the lid it still leaked from there. And on top of that, the lid is a PAIN to take off. The plastic get slippery to hold when wet and the handle makes it difficult to get a good grip to unscrew the cap. I would definitely NOT buy another one of these cups. Don't waste you money."
1,Not very good,"I was excited to get a set of these cheaply since my daughter likes the Munchkin one she has. These are bigger than the one she has so I thought it would be a great time saver/sanity saver for me so I wouldn't have to refill so often.The problem is, the spout shifts when you tighten the lid, causing leaks. Then, as she is drinking, it sinks from the force of the suction. Then it leaks. So I thought I would help it release air a bit, but that just made things a lot worse.I will use these for back up or to hold refills for her usual sippy (I do like that it has a lid that goes over the spout) but will be getting more Munchkin cups. At least those only leak when you fill them too full."
3,Colors,I realize it said assorted colors but i got 2 pink and one blue cup. These were for my grandson. yYou would think the colors would be gender neutral.
2,"This worked at the beginning, now it leaks after a few weeks of use","I was really excited to switch from a bottle to a soft spout cup and when I first got this one, baby had no trouble switching. It did not leak, it appeared to be the perfect cup, that is until it started leaking and the suction is acting funny! When my son starts sucking on this, the top gets in the cup completely, like a vacuum, I would have to unscrew it to let air in and it pops back out. Also, I am not sure how this happened but the top soft part moved from where it's supposed to stay and now the handles and the spout don't align properly. I actually have to hold the cup for him otherwise it's all off and he is having a hard time figuring it out. I will not using this cup anymore, it just really frustrates me. I got him ones with straws instead and they work much better."
2,leaks like nothing else!!,my daughter loves to feed from this cup because the handles are way comfy. however this cup leaks none stop and this is no exageration!! would have returned it if i lived in the usa!!
1,Leaks like mad! Absolute Rubbish!,"I had the Nuby 5 ounce sippy and my son took to that but I wanted a sippy with a lid to keep the spout clean during travel. I saw this in a 2-pack at Meijer and thought that it was perfect since it held more liquid and had a lid too. But this leaked from the spout from the get go!I ended up buying a new one, such a waste of money this was!"
2,Too hard to drink from!,"We tried this cup and when my daughter bangs it on something hard it leaks. Furthermore, the suction valve is so tight my daughter inverts the silicone top while drinking because she sucks so hard, and then the top is all folded over and she can't drink at all! I am always undoing the lid to release the suction. We have another Nuby cup that has the same problem. You can fix the problem by opening up the valve a little with a sharp knife or blade, but then it leaks more. My daughter's favorite use of her sippy cup is ""painting"" with water on the bedsheets using her sippy cup. Much to our dismay! We've tried two Nuby cups and won't ever buy NUBY again."
5,Good product for learning how to drink from sippy!,My daughter used these to learn how to drink from a sippy cup. I tried a two other kinds before landing on this one. This is the only one she had success with pretty much right from the start! highly highly recommend!
1,Ripped Off..Did not receive what was offered.,"The ad showed a packed carded group of wicks (apparently changed since my email and complaint) with the description ""Wicks Carded 24 Included"" Maybe I'm a little slow..but a picture of 24 wicks and a description, '24 included', seems pretty straight forward. I received 1 wick?! I wrote the company who responded..'return for refund if not satisfied'. You've got to be kidding...package up 1 wick...drive to the post office...pay for return postage...wait forever for the refund...check credit card to make sure I received it...YOU GOT THE PICTURE. The appropriate response should have been; Sorry for the mistake, keep the wick, we will refund your money. All I'm saying is the seller should review what they are selling on Amazon and clearly and properly advertise what they are selling. The seller never offered to check ad or correct it, maybe they will get around to it.Signed...Ripped Off"
1,RIPPED OFF,"OK, First of all here I'm thinking this is a good deal saying it has 24 in it. well when i get it there is only one ****** thing in there."
2,picture,Need to change the picture. It makes you think you are going to get more then one wick. I was my bad for not reading everything but the picture is really misleading. i would not have bought this if i knew there was only one wick.
1,wtf!!!!,so theres 24 well i got 1 for 15 buscks i thought i was getting goods stuff i could of bout a zipp with that much but that is a cheep move dont buy this and well fluid cost less flints cost less(online) but live an learn
5,Scandal is literally from start to finish!!!,"This book was definitely a page turner! I know I constantly desired to know what would happen next. Once I picked it up there was no putting it down. The twist and turns are guarenteed to have you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fun read; one that is realistic and interesting. The author really does reinvent story-telling. Though she is a newcomer, London's career as an author is very promising. Her style and knack for story-telling will keep audiences constantly wanting more!!"
3,scrittori maledetti,"Testi maledetti, scrittori maledetti, Celine, Junger, Bloy, quando potremo leggere tutto senza censure?"
4,Charming and listenable Christmas album,"This album, by Boston-area performer Bleu and a lot members of local bands (including Dicky Barrett of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Rubyhorse, Guster, and others), is a charming album that includes fun remixes of classic tunes (e.g., the Bing Crosby ""Mele Kalikimaka""), intriguing instrumentals (""The Carol of the Bells""), goofy covers of Christmas carols (Boston All Star 12 Dayz, with Boston bands on a modified version of the Twelve Days of Christmas) and just plain kick-out-the-jams rockin' Christmas tunes, like the excellent original tune ""Snow Day."" Oddly enough, this is one of the more enduring Christmas albums my family and I play, since it blends real Christmas spirit and fun. Plus, you gotta give credit for this line in ""12 Dayz:"" ""On the eleventh day of Christmas, my true love said to me, 'this song's getting boring, better try to cut a verse'...Five gooolden rings!"""
3,Additional Thoughts,"This was a very interesting glimpse into the life of soldiers in WWII, and contains some interesting radio broadcasts from the era.The quality of the audio is on par with the technology available for the time and the publishers did not run it through any filters, (or if they did some of it was very poor quality to begin with). However, this product does deliver on what it advertises.Its historical significance is only appreciable, to those who already study the events of WWII; this product is in no way a solid tool to use, other than enhancing existing resources with some interesting audio clips.If you are looking for some audio clips from the era, and will not mind the (understandable) quality issues of the clips, then this may be a good product for you."
2,NOT motorized,"We bought this as an extra train to go with our new Geotrax set for our two boys ... it is NOT a motorized train. It has lights and sounds ONLY, does not move on its own."
4,It's scheffield and jenkins!,"Characters are very similar to what they have on the DVD. My kids enjoy GeoTraxs and I have been happy with the prices we have found. Enjoy the entire set, although the investment can get substantial if you get the entire set."
5,Dennis at one of his best!,This was an awesome tape. This contained a lot of his most recent funny things and rages about american life and politics. Also includes what could be considered his first ever rant (about James Stockdale) which catapulted him into HBO stardom. It cost a bit but it is highly recommended for DM fans like me.
2,Dennis: Not at His Best,"""Dennis Miller Live from Washington D.C."" was the third and unfortunately the least of the acerbic comedian's hour long stand up comedy specials he taped before he began doing his weekly show for HBO. In the topical (both political and social) commentary that predominates, you can see him laying the foundations for what would be a successful ten seasons as late night's most adventuresome talk show host.Unfortunately, the material is just not as strong as on the first two specials. A lot of the topical stuff is of course dated (the show was taped in early 1993, but the even older material on the earlier shows (1990 and 1987) are just plain funnier. Also, it must be noted that there are NO worthwhile extras on this DVD, despite its relatively high cost. Since all three of Dennis's HBO specials coauld easily fit on one DVD, this one feels a bit like a cheat. Don't get me wrong, I love Dennis Miller, I just don't love this DVD."
4,Miller review,"This was done before 9/11. To me, he has become much more conservative fiscally, militarily and diplomatically. He seems to have a line of demarcation in his routines; ""Before 9/11"" and ""After 9/11"". He is still socially liberal/moderate, but everything else sounds like a neo-con apologist. Too bad, we could have used his wit and intelligence on the left. I hope he lives long enough to see who the real enemy to America is, and it's not the pansies on the left, Iran, North Korea or Cuba."
4,It's Greek to me!,"Just got the book; I bought it used. Hardcover. Seems like a good, basic Greek cookbook. There are a few pencilled-in notes from a previous owner which I actually appreciate. The book has the favorites: baklavah, roast leg of lamb, moussaka, and of course that delicious lemon sauce the Greeks often use. I'm more of an eater than a cooker, so I like this book. The recipes seem easy and that's perfect for me; all I need is a bit of a direction for spices and so forth, and hoopla - it's dinner!"
2,plagiarized and dumbed down,"The recipes are mostly plagiarized and cleverly edited by this author (unfortunately this happens frequently with cookbook authors).Many of the dishes bear no relationship to the reality of the dish...with ingredients left out and often in the wrong proportions. Non Greek cooks may think that this book beats all, but it is clearly a mediocre presentation of Greek cooking at best.For an excellent and truly knowledgable Greek cookbook tryThe Ultimate Greek Cookbook, by Vangelis Driskas (Patakis Publishers)"
4,Unique retro swing,"This is yet another retro swing band, but a special one. The big difference here is the lead singer's voice, which is very fluid, soulful, jazzy... just really good. This is a live album so you also get to hear him blab his hipster talk between songs. Not sure I understand what all the lyrics are about yet; sometimes the guy seems to be singing about a whole lot of stuff.But it's pretty decent."
1,Not what I was expecting...,"We bought this magnet set for our (dysfunctional but lovable) would-be therapist nephew... what a waste. First off, can we talk about the QUALITY of this thing? The words on the magnets for the most part cut into the tear-off points...so that some magnets have missing letters! I guess its pretty inexpensive, but it was so worthless. It's impossible to create coherent sentences, and some of the word choices seem ridiculous. I wouldn't buy it again. Total waste of money."
5,southern rock,"both these albums were then and still some of the best southern rock if you love skynyrd you will love this classic RCB they only did two albums but they could jam.,"
2,Jewels or Paste?,"I know this is a classic, I know it made it to Masterpiece Theater, but I just cannot grab hold of the story. It is our book club's choice this month and I struggled to read the entire book but only made it half way through and was easily distracted by many other books.My perception is of an old and fussy book, much like the main character. It's dense and slow and just couldn't hold me."
2,The Raj Quaertet -a snooze!,"I was so looking forward to reading The Raj Quartet, as I find other countries and cultures so interesting. However, even though I love historical fiction, this book just put me to sleep."
3,Changing attitudes...,"This was a re-read for me, as I read the entire Raj quartet originally when it was first published.Strangely, even though I couldn't put it down then, it was a disappointment to me this time... strange how that can happen the second time around."
2,Great feeling of Raj India,"One can see and almost smell the India of early 20th century India. Unfortunate for me, the book is a real downer. It so concentrates do much on the class divisions and emotions the story disappears and it becomes merely a stenotype repeated endlessly. I really enjoyed the beginning but got way too bogged down by the endlessly repeated theme."
1,The beginning of the book did not draw me in. It did not give me a reason to continue.,"I like a book that ""sells"" me on the story. Some take a chapter or two to set the stage, but I found this one didn't do that. I did not finish the book."
3,British Guilt,"The novel is well written, but with insufferable detail about the British rule in India. The story moves with glacial speed as the author recounts all the injustices the Brits caused in their dealings with the Indains. Hopefully most Brits have moved on after the Raj was abandoned over 50 years ago."
1,excruciating,"I learned a bit of history but it was excruciating! It was probably a more relevant book at the time it was written in the 60's. The author included the thoughts and reflections of many different characters, but it was just too much. I can't imagine slogging through the other three books."
2,The Raj Quartet,The Raj Qrartet: It was very wordy. It just took too long to say anything or describe it. The style was boring to me.
3,"The Raj Quartet, Volume 1","Would like more background on the true history of India, the three sects and how the British screwed another country up."
4,Makes the wait for the new album (2001) bearable...,"If you love HWM than you will love this. This collection of singles highlights some of the best songs that HWM has ever penned. ""The Bitter End"" remains in my opinion one of the best HWM songs ever. Not a starter album, but a wonderful filler for those of us who can't wait until they complete the new album. A strong heartfelt offering. Tracks include Alchua, Never Ender, The Bitter End, You Can Take The Boy Out Of Bradenton, Hate Mail Comes in August, Elektra, Powder, Us & Chuch, Loft, and Sound For Language. The packaging is a nice bonus. The artwork by Scott Sinclair is beautiful."
4,They blow my mind!,"I bought this album 2 days after seeing them live in Singapore recently, where they completely blew my mind. Having so gotten used to The Man Who and more recently, The Invisible Band, I was frankly worried when Coldplay started the concert first, thinking that, much as I loved them, I was not looking forward to end the evening with ""slow"" songs. I could not have been more wrong. While the songs from the later two albums were given a new and brilliant lease of life when played ""live"", it was the songs from this album which really rocked the stadium. I never knew Travis played rockier songs (though ""Blue Flashing Light"" was a good indication), and frankly, on certain days I prefer this album to the other two. A must buy if you have the later albums - the collection would not be complete without it. It took me all of 24 hours to really love this album.A Travis album you could dance to, with bits of head-banging thrown in for good measure. What more could you want??"
4,Impressive,"It took a few listens, but I ended up loving this CD. There's something engaging about it that I can't put my finger on. Now if they would only release the second album ""The Man Who"" in the states..."
3,Wheat and chaff.,"A scattered affair, with several standout ballads and a few appallingly banal rockers. Travis was a young developing band at this time, as evidenced by the Tiger Beat-inspired ""U16 Girls"", and yet they also reach soaring heights of song craft on ""All I Wanna Do is Rock"", the festive ""Happy"", and especially the closing ballads ""More Than Us"", ""Falling Down"", and ""Funny Thing."". The bizarre sequencing forces listeners to wade through the chaff to get to the sublime moments, which when they come are indeed superb. Travis' subsequent albums have dispensed with sophomoric rockers in favor of wistful, gorgeous ballads and power anthems worthy of the best Britpop. ""Good Feeling"" is merely a primer to Travis' subsequent greatness."
3,"I like this, but LOVE The Man Who...","I became a Travis fan after seeing and MTV2 clip of Why Does It Always Rain On Me? I bought THE MAN WHO and fell in love with the melodic, acoustic, free-spirited songs. So naturally I bought GOOD FEELING. I was disappointed. It's hard for me to belive it's the same band. While THE MAN WHO is lyrically strong, sounds polished, and well produced; GOOD FEELING sounds more like an unrehearsed English grunge band. No doubt, it's great rock and roll with some toe tapping tunes. But if you are searching for more of what you love about THE MAN WHO, I don't think you are going to find it on this disk. I took the time to listen to all the Real Audio clips on amazon.com and failed to trust my instincts."
1,a disappointment,"I want to warn any pagans or those interested in paganism away from this book. I myself am a practicing pagan of many years. I know that Sybil Leek was a highly respected wiccan, and probably rightly so, but this book is a mess. The biggest chunk of it is spent dumping on contemporary pagans who just aren't doing it right (per Sybil), fairly uninteresting anecdotes, and surprisingly lame stuff like a whole chapter where she wrestles with her own homophobia. There's many better books than this one out there."
1,Dissapointing...,"I loved ""Diary of a Witch"" and was hoping that this book would be just as good and give even more insight. This book can not compare. It takes away Sybil's validity. She is really quite vain and arrogant,very self absorbed,and homophobic. It was a dissapointement and even made my view of ""Diary of a Witch"" come down a notch. Much too wordy and runs around in circles."
2,a unrealistic look at witchcraft today,I think that this book was to bland and anti i myself are a witch and think that this book is very degrading to all witches but it did teach me soom new things that i had never heard of befor.
1,antisemitic trash,"Perhaps Turgenev was reflecting the prejudices of his day, but the story of the Jew is highly antisemitic -- and distasteful. Had I known of its content, I would never have downloaded it."
4,christmas tree,This tree is perfect for a small apartment and since the lights are already on it we where able to get right in the fun of decorating together.
2,watch out for the hot spot,"I bought this with high expectations but was disappointed because when I use it on my gas stove, it tends to get a hot spot in the center where your soup/stew can BURN. No fun. It's great for the oven though so I now brown everything in a separate pot, then pour everything into this one and throw it in to bake."
5,Wonderful Pan for the price!!,"I have done so many things in this pan! I love it. You can't beat the money at Amazon for this line. I love the hard anodized surface.... and the cleanup is so easy!! I have seared and roasted and fried and baked in this pan! This is the first calphalon product I have owned, and I just ordered the everyday pan today. I was taken aback at how large the pan was at first, but in this case size didn't matter for even, rather quick heating! Love that you can sear in the juices of your meat and then throw in some veggies and liquid of your choice and then roast everything together in the oven, all in the same pan! This is living!!"
4,Bigger is sometimes better!,"Recently bought the 8 1/2 qt. saucier. We already have the 5 1/2qt size of this pan. Being an ""agressive"" cook I now prefer the larger one as I haven't splashed as much stuff over the sides.Being able to go from the stove straight to the oven is a real plus in addition to Calphalon quality. Only thing keeping it from a 5 star is the fact that the handles get hot on the stove and require potholders or mitts to move. But that same thing makes it go into the oven!AND THE PRICE AIN""T BAD EITHER!!!"
5,All purpose #1 answer,"This little pan is the most useful utensil for all kinds of smallcooking, from candy making to cooking dry beans for one or twopeople. I have purchased three of these, one for my self and onefor each of two children. It is EXCELLENT!!!"
1,Beware,"Calphalon cookware sure looks nice and heats evenly but DO NOT cook acidic foods llike tomatoes and rhubarb, or you'll be returning it over and over again. Sure, the company replaces their de-anodized pots, but who needs the bother of packaging and shipping them back when the coating disappears? Not me. I'd give them a zero stars rating, but there's not that option."
1,burned my money,"the first time I used this pot it burned like heck. I could not get the pot clean. I tried everything. I called Calpahalon and they said it was my fault, I was a bad cook and burned my food. Don't buy it, you'll be sorry."
2,Very Unhappy with this Saucier - Buy Another Calphalon Line,"I purchased this saucier less than 6 months ago. I had a housesitter stay at my home soon after I purchased the pot and they used it for making pasta. The pot was left in the sink for several days afterwards and had apparently been filled with Comet, a somewhat caustic, but not uncommon cleaner.When I returned home, I washed the pot and later tried to cook a simple soup. The non-stick finish had been ruined and the pot is worthless for anything except boiling vegitables and pasta, as anything I attempt to cook will stick to the sides and bottom.I have never had problems with Calphalon products before, but I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing this pot. If durability and a long-lasting finish are important to you, this saucier will leave you dissatisfied."
3,Was somewhat disapointed.,I just got my new pan today. I was so excited because I wanted to make a big pot of chili. But after the chili was done I found it stained my pan. I thought only plastic would get stains. and on the bottom of the pan it had rainbow marks from heat damage. So that told me it must have burned. But I never put the pot on high. At one point I did put it on just below high and not for long. I guess I thought this would be so much better then it turned out to be. I did order in the past the 2 1/2 quart size and I love those pans. I use them all the time and never have had any problems. The one with the glass lid. I may even return this I don't know what to do.Hope this helps you!
4,Cooking for a crowd?,"O.K. like I am using the heck out of this pan! For a crowd it is THE thing for a big pot of stew, soup, Osso Bucho(sorry, the spelling escapes me).I used it the other day to make beef stock-it was superb! I tossed some olive oil in, beef bones, veggies, salt+pepper, then into the oven for a couple hours to roast. Then, in the same pot, onto the stove with the water to cook down the stock. Slick.It is great for roasting, braising, stews, soups, etc. The key is ""for a group"".You will not find anything this good, for this price. This is pan you WILL find a use for.Clean up had not been a problem for me either."
4,Great Calphalon Pan,"I agree about the hot!! handles. Wasn't sure I needed such a large pan for just two people, but we like leftovers. Just be sure that when you overfill the pan like I did, that you are still able to lift it out of the oven later. (I added all the vegetables for the pot roast with the pan still in oven) The pan did cook the pot roast to perfection.Found the most wonderful other use for this large pan. Love to make the recipe for Martha Stewarts Mothers Meatloaf and my mixing bowls were never large enough to do a double batch. It is fantastic for this and the excess doesn't fall out all over the counter."
4,Perfect Braising/Oven Pot,"This used to be $40 or so on Amazon and was a complete steal. It is perfect for braising, browning, and finishing off in the oven. I've braised beef ribs, chicken, pork roasts, made soups and stews and this pot handles everything easily.Very sturdy construction and no non-stick layer to scratch, peel off, or scrape."
5,Living in the wrong place,"This is a great product. It's a pity to live in Europe, so being unable to buy this article for these prices. I do have a saucier and would love to buy another article."
5,Very entertaining,If you are a fan of the band buy it you wont be let down. The live footage looks and sounds amazing. The documentary part quite long and is funny all the way through. You can definitely go back and watch it multiple times.
5,Best band DVD,"This dvd is great! any BDM fan can agree its worth the cash the live perfomances are really good not all practiced like some bands, and as far as disc 1(the backstage stuff)really shows you how down to earth the members really are 5 stars get this dvd!!!"
3,Not Very Large Case,"I bought this thinking that it would be able to fit most digital cameras, but I was wrong. Please know that this case is very narrow. I have a Kodak DC 290 and there was no way that it was going to fit in it. Most of the digital cameras are quite large, so buyer beware.If you do have a small, compact camera, then this would be great. It looks great, has ample amount of padding and was a great case, but it was just too small."
3,Good source for a few songs,"Looking through Amazon, it's very hard to find an definate Ray Price collection, actually let's say as of 3/16/2007, totally impossible to find a definate collection. So basically what you are left to do is buy a whole bunch of cd's and put together your own collection.This cd is a good place to acquire some hard to find gems, such as ""She's Got to Be a Saint"", and ""I Wont Mention it Again."" ""Realease Me"" is a remake done with a string section.The version of Danny Boy given here is original, however, it's been chopped in half. It was originally a 5 minute plus song, and is now been stripped down to just over 2 and a half minutes. (they did the same thing on ""16 Biggest Hits"")"
2,KARAOKE CD,was not very pleased with this one so i ordered a different one. it's hard to come up with things to say when your not happy with an item!!!!!
3,The Secret Life of Bees,"I have not seen the movie but the Pink House is right down the road from where I live, its a fascinating looking house and I had to go by when they where filming and it rained alot during that time, they were patient with us as we were with them. So it was an adventure for our little neighborhood in Watha North Carolina"
2,Changed the focus,"The whole focus of the story was changed from women dealing with life's ups and downs, being great with each other, being affirmative and competent, to one where the father was the thread that hung the story together. The most unbelievable scene was where Lily and Jake kiss IN THE OPEN, where everyone could see! And this where Jennifer Hudson had already been beaten up for walking into town with Lily! An altogether disappointing re-do of a classic story."
2,the secret life of bees,"The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was the incredible level of acting especially from Dakota Fanning and Queen Latifah. The acting was over all very good but the movie dragged in many parts. It really lacked realism, a 4 year old shots a heavy pistal killing her mother. IMPOSSIBLE!"
2,bees,My wife enjoyed this movie more than i did. The shipping and packaging were great. As for the movie I couldn't really say I didn't pay attention to it.
2,The Secret Life of Bees,"Poor recording quality. Loved the movie itself, but it was so noisy, I could hardly stand watching it. Tossed it!"
3,The Secret Life of Bees,"The service was good. I could only watch the movie one time. The second time I tried to watch it, it would not play in my dvd player. I have no problems with other movies previously purchased which is why I gave a rating of 3 stars."
4,The Secret Life of Bees Video,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT STORY, BUT VERY SAD IN PARTS. I HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK AND KNEW IT WOULD BE GOOD."
4,Good movie,The actresses in this movie make it all worth watching. I do not think the Queen gets enough respect for her acting and Jennifer Hudson will one day be more known as an actress than a singer. Fanning rocks this movie. I highly recommend it.
5,coming of age story,The Secret Life of Bees is Sue Monk Kidd's wonderful coming of age story that has been brought to life in a movie of the same name. It has a cast of talented actresses and a director who handled sensitive topics and situations with insight and wisdom.
5,Beautiful movie,"This movie is beautiful. The beginning of the movie is difficult to watch -- it opens with the story of how a young girl is left motherless and follows her as she is being cared for by an abusive father. My husband just looked over at me after about 10 minutes with a huge frown since it was so upsetting in the opening scenes. There are several other story lines that make this a movie that tears at your heart, but the movie as a whole is beautiful. There are uplifting portions that bring a smile to your face. The cast is OUTSTANDING. The photography is awesome.By the time we finished, he was no longer frowning and admitted it was very, very good. A quality film from a quality novel."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps Queen Latifah has made too much money and she isn't hungry anymore, but... This film was disappointing. It has its moments, but the story, as told, as produced, as acted, is cliche and demeaning. That's the worst part of it. What a tremendous, and powerful story - but, it is undermined by those who haven't a clue what they're really talking about. I can't stand the Hollywood-ites doing films like this, and doing it seemingly content with their own shallowness and contentment with ignorance and mediocrity. This book is too important to be treated this way. They never really get past the surface. Their stabs at profundity utterly miss the mark with the cliche.I was truly looking forward to seeing this film - but, it fell far too short to get even a mediocre rating."
4,A little over the top but very good.,I liked it but it seemed to have a need to pull at the heart strings on every single event. Good GOD I was a mess. Crying my eyes out at every turn. After a while it felt like cheap shots to get me to cry. It shamefully worked. I wonder if I can watch it again.
4,"VERY GOOD, BUT A LITTLE SLOW IN SPOTS!","While 'The Secret Life Of Bees' has some very good characters and an interesting story to tell, I found that the film did drag sometimes and ultimately kept me from really believing in it from beginning to end. It's a good film with some very good performances, but I have seen better films of this nature and that is why I give it a 4 star rating. It's worth seeing, but I don't see this movie becoming one of those films you watch every year."
2,I've seen better.............,"The movie wasn't that good. I can't honestly say what the problem was, but I wouldn't sit through it again. I will be selling it at my upcoming yard sale."
1,the secret lives of bees,the condition of this dvd was pooooor. took 3 days of skips and pauses to see movie.
1,Very disappointed..Buy the book,"I'd wanted to see the movie for some time now and was given the book as a gift. The book itself was pretty good but was so descriptive it ruined the movie for me. I finished the book on Sunday and decided to rent instead of buying the movie on Wednesday. I was excited to see the movie but was instantly disappoint. It deviated from the book a little which was fine but the story seemed to go so fast; trying to fit as much into an hour and a half as possible. I'm a fan of all of the actresses d absolutely loved the acting of Sophie Okonedo, who played the part of sister May. All in all the movie was both over and under-acted.I don't know if I would have liked the movie had I not read the book. There were heartwarming moments and I shed a tear or two but all in all I'm glad I didn't purchase the movie. I actually could have waited until it aired o cable."
1,Who Knew Bees Made Schmaltz??,It's a thick swim through the cloying muck of this flick. Perhaps the ladies will warm up to the sweetness of the Queen's matronly warmth.
2,Scratched-DVD,"This DVD was very dirty & scratched, when I recieved it. Not very pleased!I started to return to sender. Used does not mean scratched!!"
1,Bad DVD,"I absolutely love this movie (The Secret Life of Bees). So, I was excited when I saw I could purchase it online. I set down with my popcorn and daughter and tissues and lo and behold, the DVD skips all over the place. For a new movie in an unopened package I find it difficult to understand this. I have always received the best of product with Amazon.com. Hopefully, ""The Help"" is in much better shape."
5,gift,I purchased The Secret Life of Bees for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She said it was awesome and one that she will watch many times over.
5,The Secret Life of Bees,"Awesome Blu-ray DVD!!! Great casting. Dakota Fanning is an amazing actress, as is Queen Latifah, Alicia Keyes, and Jennifer Hudson. Very entertaining. Highly recommend."
4,Matches Up To the Book Well,"I loved the book to start with. The movie followed the book closely. All of the actors and actresses played their parts well. This movie will be liked mostly by ladies. It kinds fits into the chick flick- drama category. I felt the movie was heart felt, and kept my attention. My favorite actress was Queen Latifa. She plays a great strong older sister. The DVD its self played well. It was packaged well."
3,The book was better,I read the book a while ago & was excited for the movie. I decided to purchase the movie instead of just renting because I like most of the cast. However I was terribly disappointed in the movie. This has nothing to do with the cast & mostly to do with the directing/producing of the film. It left alot of details out that I felt were very well needed for those who have not read the book. There was way to much picturing & not enough acting in this. While there were many moments in which you could see the cast moving about as if the camera was not there & life was just that (only acting it) it still left many unexplained moments.The cast did a great job however I recommened the book over the movie in this case.
4,heartwarming,"The secret life of bees was a wonderful story for family or adults. Dakota Fanning put in her expected excellent proformance. Her character was believeable, sympathetic and with purpose. The rest of the cast also did a smashing job."
4,"Powerful Story, A must buy for your library!","Dakota Fanning is amazing actor, Alica keys, Jennifer Hudson, and Queen Latifah amazing performances! Very good for a book to movie make."
3,"Sweet, but not as magical as the book.","I loved the novel this movie is based on, and I thought that starring Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, Queen Latifah, Alicia Keys, and Paul Bettany, I could hardly go wrong with the movie. However, I was a little disappointed that some of the ""magic"" qualities of the novel were not translated to the film.Overall, performances were strong (particularly Dakota Fanning and Queen Latifah) and enough of the book's original charm made the leap between mediums. Unfortunately, some of the otherworldly fantasy that made me fall in love with the book was absent in the film adaptation."
5,the secret life of bees,"I loved this movie, story & time, was my teen years. all the actors were excellant. you could see how bad life was & abuse Lily lived with. then she found a true family"
5,One Great Book,Very good western. I really liked the main character (forgot his name because I read the book a year or so ago) This book was based on a true story. If you like a story of bravery than this is it.
1,Don't Buy it!,"If you have read ""What Good Teachers Do Differently' or visa versa don't buy it. It is almost verbatim and a WASTE of money and time."
5,Fantastic!,Great book to inspire all adminstrators to do things differently to be highly effective! A must read for ALL administrators!
3,Not as good as Borsalino,"Have to be in just the right mood to listen to this album! Love ragtime but variety is the key as it can become a tad monotonous after a while. Bought this after tracking down Borsalino in Europe to replace a damaged tape. Borsalino being instrumental has more of a French feel and is beautiful, despite being the sound track from a gangster movie. While the same theme throughout, the varying of the theme holds a great deal of interest and reflects lovely musical and instrumental balance. This album was not quite in the same league being primarily piano playing and more honkey tonk style."
2,Bad!!!,"Tristian Hawkins, Chuck Palahniuk and Dijan... Bad bad bad! There is nothing here. There is no character, no story. Just soft-core sexual appetite and swearing. Ah, you can find a few comic passage. Simple people, simple lifes. It does not worth to telling or reading. Walk on the streets, you should find many Betty Blues and bad authors!"
5,An Enlightening Expierience,"This book is not only a great book,it is an enlightening expierience. You will get more out of life just by reading it. By reading this book you will be a very interesting conversationalist!"
5,Abiding,"My husband read this book about 15 years ago. I just recently picked it up again and have fallen in love with it. It explains so well the fact that to walk with the Lord, we just have to let go and let Him have control -- in every area of our lives. It's amazing to me how we can trust God with our eternal soul, but it's so hard to trust Him with today."
1,Lied to,I was very disappointed. I was sold a book that was supposed to be new.It was as old and yellowed as bad as the one I had for 15 yearsI could have bought a brand new one at Walmart for less moneyTheir comment on the bill said New book never read light shelfwear to cover and is lightly tanned due to storage.Never again. Nothing right about it
1,Poor Book,This is a very hard book to follow. The writing seems to jump around and at times it does not make a whole lot of sence. If you want a straight foward book this is not the one for you.
4,The Secret Revealed,"This book is an excellent compilation of stories of those who indeed found the secret. In brief, these biographical sketches reveal the essence of living the life of Christ: dying to self that Christ might live his life through us. As a believer, to see this central theme portrayed in different ways in the lives of those who have gone on before us, is a source of much encouragement. Our journey in the faith finds context in theirs and we are thus affirmed in our own quest for the secret. A book to be highly recommended."
5,Antiques are not just for furniture--Wisdom too!,"This is an incredible little jewel. The different perspectives and searches illustrate that the Bible is grounded in timeless truth. As I read the different perspectives, I walked and talked with the writers. The timeless wisdom reached from the 1800's to 2007. They truly did find the secret and now, I have as well."
4,A classic to have on your spiritual biography shelf,"Though the language is somewhat archaic and high-flown, V. Raymond Edman's collection of chapters on those who have experienced Union Life is both very encouraging and a library must-have. I've returned to this book over and over in my devotional life-----reminding myself of the secret of the truly happy Christian life----Jesus in me as me."
4,what you talking about people.,"Only really the mixed CD in this 3 CD set is worth listening. But worth listening to it is! For all those cheesy Disco lovers out there (most of who have written reviews below) then this is not for you. The CD starts with a funky fast pace and then kind of looses the feel a little towards the later tracks. Still a high class CD though, if you are a huge fan of Dimitri then i garantee you will like this CD. If you have only ever heard Playboy Mansion and think all Dimitri CDs should be as good as that, then you will probably be dissapointed with what ever you buy (maybe try Dimitri Southport weekender, comes with 2 other disks but well worth a listen). Overall classy, stylish if not a little crazy and out there in places."
4,Happy &lovely,"Not as captivating as the Night at the Playboy Mansion, but what could be. Still this cd has made me smile for a year now. Especially remarkable tracks are Love Supreme, Aint no stoppin us now and Que Tal America. Love that spanish! For (occasional) dj purposes the songs are available in their full lenght in two separate cds. Perfect music for sunny days and early evenings."
2,Mixed listening,"Picture is great. the contents are not so hot. 3 cd's just to fill up space. ...they went for Quantity NOT Quality.... shame.It's o.k., but I don't play it too often. Disappointing."
3,Only for fanatics,"There are some good tracks here, but, no matter what the liner notes say, the hispanic remakes of disco classics are somewhere between totally superfluous and only for the fanatical disco collector, because musically they don't amount to much. Three CDs, and between them probably less substance than the (excellent) Night at the Playboy Mansion."
5,don't even think about not getting this,"So, I a roommate of mine had this years ago and I loved it, so I finally remembered and got it. This is some of the best underground disco, two man sound, silver platinum & gold....makes you want to dance and dance and dance. get it."
1,this is BAD!,"well if you have the dough on spending money on music that are covers of famous songs and the music is not even the original......in other words all the songs are not the original artists, including the music as well.. this CD goes directly to the trash can.. thats what i did.. this cd is disapointing.. i need my money back! not recomended.."
1,The sound is not good,"The sound is really not very good. I use it because I do not want to bother sending it back, but it is only good for my own personal listening enjoyment (if you can call it that). I have since purchase a FM receiver to play on my old stereo system and at least the sound is amplified through the speakers all around. This speaker system is terrible. It does however charge my Ipod."
2,Decent...,I was expecting more after reading all the good reviews..... but I guess you get what you pay for. I honestly wouldn't pay more than $10 for this. It feels cheaply made and it was only about 75% stuffed. save your money and buy another pillow!
2,lumpy,I thought I would save some money after trying the one at the Sleep Number store. This does not begin to compare. I should have bought the original ):
1,Too hot,"It is uncomfortable as it is hot, I tried it one night and I was turning every minute, very hot and very soft. It might be good for the people who like to have warm pillow and soft pillow."
2,I wanted to try it...,"but don't like it!For a person who sleeps in every position though mostly side and tummy, I only found it comfortable to use on one side! Since each end of the pillow has a different firmness, I don't understand how people can use it for more than one position!?It got two stars for at least being inexpensive to try..."
4,Best Pillow,This pillow is perfect for me because I sleep on my back and my side - either way the pillow is like a headrest or cradle and it helps to align my body.
2,At first thought it was great.,"After 2 nights my neck hurt and not enough support for your head. Although I do like this for reading, as aback support. I bought two thinking I would have a great nights sleep, but I am still looking for that."
3,Smaller than I thought,"I was looking for this same type pillow that I had several years ago-it was a little longer on both of the arms, and a little higher as well. I had back surgery many years ago, and must sleep with a pillow between my legs, so this shape is wonderful for me-the shorter part goes between my knees, and the long part goes up my front as a ""belly"" bolster. This one works for now, but is not very comfortable as neither of the arms are long enough. I guess my search goes on!"
3,Okay pillow,"Well what can I say about this item. The pillow was great when I first got it because it was nice and firm, had to get use to sleeping with it since it is curved. It was comfortable, but now more than a couple of weeks the pillow has gotten flat and I have to push it together and hold it to get any fluff. Give it three stars for that reason."
1,No suppport,Got this pillow because I have chronic neck pain after 2 neck surgeries. Read reviews - so I thought I would try this. I have spent a lot of money searching for the right pillow. Very disappointed. This pillow was almost flat and offered no support - it does not cradle your neck nor support your shoulders as advertised. I was hoping this was the one. I am once again back to searching for the right pillow.
1,Sore neck and buyer's remorse,"This pillow is awful. I can't believe there are so many good reviews. First off, there is no noticeable difference between the two sides of the pillow- they are both rock hard. I like firm pillows, but this pillow is more firm than is reasonable. The pillow height seems wrong, too. I am not petite, and the pillow is too high. Because the pillow is so hard and too high, my neck bends in a very uncomfortable way. The 2 nights I used the pillow were extremely painful. The pillow claims that is is suitable for all sleeping positions. That is simply not true. The only position that is even slightly comfortable is on your side, and only if you are very broad shouldered."
3,I like it a lot,"First off - it's a polyester fiber-fill pillow. A year's worth of daily use and it will be flat as a pancake, if not sooner. Why anyone would expect more than that for less than $20 is beyond me.For what it is though, it's pretty great. I don't use it as a main sleeping pillow - I have a really high quality one for that - but this is wonderful on nights when I just can't get comfortable, want to read in bed, after surgery and stuff like that. I have found it to be very useful in lots of ways.The cover is scratchy and I'll probably make a new one, but I don't notice any smells or anything. I will definitely buy one again when this one is flat."
4,"good, but no foamy feel","ordered for my wife,she says:""the shape provides support from all sidesand what I've been always missing - i can sleep on my belly now and my shoulders would not be curling in downwards (cause of my breasts, it'd been always like that and I was dreaming of a pillow with shoulder suport)so, a lot of support, that's coolbut the filler does not feel pleasant, it's not this sort of foam that would remember your cheek or let you in gently - feels rather like a usual cheap thing, like wadding or a filler for old sleeping bags..it breathes fine though"""
5,We love these pillows!,"My wife and I just love these pillows, they are very comfortable and we hate to sleep without them.Well made and comfortable."
5,"So far, so good","I've read the reviews of as many different support pillows as I could find on amazon and a few other sites. One reviewer of this item influenced me to give it a try because it sounded like she was dealing with the same issues I am/was.This pillow has provided immediate relief from fairly significant neck pain. It hasn't disappeared, but this pillow definitely has me aligned better at night. I am a side sleeper, who mostly stays on one side. This pillow does what hugging a pillow would do, except that because your head is on one end, it won't run away during the night. It also causes me to stop hunching forward with my head/neck at night (read: less fetal position with a curved neck). So far it's a perfect firmness; I will come back to report if it loses its loft too quickly.Also, my pillow speaker stays in the custom pillow case with no problem."
2,Not so good,"I had high hopes for this pillow, since I have severe neck pain. It really did not do the job and now it sits in my closet. I do not recommend."
1,Duro-Med Hugg-A-Pillow,"I purchased four Duro-Med Hugg-A-Pillows for my family. Unfortunately, not one of us found them remotely comfortable. I really wished they would have lived up to their billing."
1,Pillow Goes Almost Flat,"When I first received this product it was fluffy and dense. Four months later, the pillow has lost its fluff, and it creases in the center of the pillow."
5,I love this pillow,"I have purchased much, much more expensive pillows. This one is not made of super-high-end memory foam or anything like that... but it's EXACTLY what I was looking for. It usually takes me a while to get used to a new pillow but I loved this one from the start. I sleep on my side, and this lets me wrap an arm around it, sleep without laying on my other arm, and have support behind my head to keep it where I want it. For this price I am absolutely pleased with the purchase. The material feels like it might not be extremely long-lasting, but for the price I will happily buy another one when this one wears out."
3,Don't buy if you don't like firm pillows,"I bought this pillow for myself and I wish I hadn't wasted the money. I don't like firm pillows and wish I had know how firm it was before purchasing it. On the other hand, my boyfriend loves the pillow. Overall, it's a great pillow if you like firm pillows."
3,Look For Something Better,This pillow is okay but lacks support. Conceptually its a good idea but the construction is sub-par quality - it needs more support and more fluffly-ness. If they filled it with a different material it would be better.
3,what's wrong with this picture,"i am reviewing the album pictured at amazon. it is not the album with the track listing displayed hence the reason i titled the review after an andrew gold album.the pictured cd is the third produced by meisner after ""one more song"" on epic records not asylum. it featured a hit single ""never been in love before"" along with another nice track ""darkness of the heart"".it is not as strong as its predecessor but much better than the initial asylum album. i have an import copy. whether it is available stateside i don't know but if you're a fan it's a nice piece"
1,"A Cover Artist Maybe, A Solo Artist No","This album is a failure. Randy does well covering the oldies, ""If You Want to be Happy"" and the Drifters, ""Save the Last Dance for Me and even covers his song recorded with the Eagles 'Take it to the Limit"" but the rest of the album flops and is very hard to listen to without falling asleep, when you wake up the album is over, ""Thank God"""
1,DVD drive has problems,"I just returned my e-Machines M6810 notebook after discovering that the DVD drive was defective. The drive ""glitches"" and will not read a DVD smoothly. Apparently, this is a common problem, as one of the managers at Best Buy stated that they have been told to ""expect"" this problem and are now ""redirecting"" customers towards other notebooks (Problem DVD drives are apparently as frequent as one out of every 2-3 notebooks). This is unfortunate because this model (after reviewing and comparing other notebooks for days prior to making the purchase) truly does have some nice hardware on board (e.g. 64 bit processor, 512MB RAM, 64MB ATI 9600 dedicated videocard). Another problem I ran into with this laptop is in regards to its ethernet driver. Windows XP will not allow a simple ""plug and play"" internet connection as the required driver is not recognized. This problem was only adding insult to injury after seeing this machine play a DVD. Save some time and look elsewhere."
5,Another great album by a great almost unknown talent,"One thing that can be said about Holly Cole is that she seldom dissappoints. Her smooths vocals and beautiful arrangements, makes you want to slip back and imagine some smokey, dimly lite jazz clubs that does not open until midnight.If you love ""Don't Smoke in Bed"", you will want to own this one."
3,In the shade,"Shade, in my opinion, is a pale shadow of the listening experience offered by Temptation.It's nice in a damning way - nice as in the safe date you can show to your parents and they won't worry.Damning with faint praise?Indeed."
5,Love this CD,"I usually don't write reviews for products. But I love the CD so much that I have to write about it. My son (2 yrd) loves it too. It has familiar songs with intereting twists. I usually play kids music in the car for my son, and I got sick of all those songs over and over again. With Mr David's songs, my whole family never got bored. My son would also imitate the sounds Mr David makes in the CD. highly recommend."
2,big disappointment,"The author went to Burma already with his mind made up; things were bad and he was going to see more bad things and talk to people with bad experiences, and have bad experiences himself, and have a thoroughly miserable time the whole time he was there. And he managed to do just that. In no way at all was his writing ""beautiful"" or ""poetic."" But he managed to miss the beautiful and poetic side of the amazing Burmese people in the country he visited. Not a good introduction to this much-misunderstood country or the resilient people who live there."
2,Terribly disappointing,"Inaccurate in fact and impression, frequently demeaning to Burmese while feigning respect, this book could get away with its poor quality when there were few first-hand travel narratives, but there are now many more books about the country, this one has little to offer."
1,Betrayed Reader,"I was under the impression that this was a must read from the other reviews. The quote on the cover from Fergal Keane says he cannot imagine a better book on the beauty and terror of Burma. I read to page nine and found a great descriptive of sex with the character Ni Ni. ""He rose inside her, so deep that she thought she might burst"".Not my kind of book on beauty and the terror of any land."
4,Worth the money,"Bought a second one and that tells the story.....the method of closing off the drinking straw looks to me like it should not last long and would drip....well it does last long, and doesn't drip...keeps water cold and doesn't sweat...how do it know is a mystery.....may buy a third."
3,Replacement cap???,"An excellent water bottle, keeps liquids icy cold for many hours, but when the plastic cap breaks it's useless because the straw pops up and it leaks everywhere. I can't find a replacement anywhere! Very frustrating that they don't sell replacement caps for such an expensive water bottle."
4,Ice Cold Water On-The-Go,"At last a thermos that you can open one-handed and drink from without taking your eyes off the road. Unlike most thermal cups it doesn't leak with the lid closed and barely dribbles with the cap open even when held upside down. It fits in the cup holder on my jeep although it may not fit in your car's standard drink holder. However, don't let that stop you. Toss it onto the passenger seat, ready for those long thirsty stretches of road where you can't pull over and stop. The instructions say ""no hot beverages"" and ""no carbonated beverages"", but for an ice water lover, this item is ideal. I love this item and will use it on all my trips."
3,One weak point,"I was very happy with this product for awhile. All the good things other reviewers say are true. But it has one weak point. There is a removable plastic straw that transports liquid from the thermos to the permanent straw that you drink from. After about 25 uses, this straw developed a crack in it, and now when the thermos is down to about 1/3 full, I get mostly air when I sip. What a disappointment in an otherwise great product!"
2,DON'T PUT ANY CARBONATED DRINKS IN IT,"This product won't allow you to put any carbonated drinks inside. It leaks out when you do. If you plan to use something for cokes, etc....make sure you select a carbonated version. This version doesn't provide the necessary extra gaskets like the others to keep it leakproof. It is ok for non-carbonated drinks."
2,WARNING: Thermos offers NO replacement parts,"I have used this thermos every day for more than a year to carry protein shakes. Because of food allergies, I bring it whenever I leave the house, so that I do not get hungry and eat foods that are off my diet. This has been a real health benefit, and the pop-up straw makes the thermos extremely easy to use when on the go.Now for the bad part: After only a few months, the thermos began to leak, which can create a real mess. Several months later, the plastic parts inside (the straw and gasket) began to split and break down. However, the company tells me there are no replacement parts available. So this otherwise fine steel thermos becomes unusable due to the fact that Thermos fails to offer replacements for the little plastic parts that break easily. Sounds like planned obsolescence."
5,14 year search for this cd,"I heard this on vinyl in a bedsit on the Osborne Road, Jesmond, UK... back in 1977 and thought it was awesome. Like Dr Feelgood on steroids. It was a performance that put together everything I loved in a band all on one album. Then I tried to get a copy. Forget it, it was like asking for a copy of the Queen Mother's chest xrays. I've been trying to get a copy of this seriously since 1998. Now I've got it and it is still awesome. Even my son who was born about 15 years after this album came out thinks it's smoking. This is Rock and Roll. Get it if you can."
4,"So good, it makes you forget how bad the movie was (almost)","Believe it or not, the novelization of the laughably bad movie ""Jaws: The Revenge"" is actually a pretty good book. The characters have an interesting depth to them, the plot has a lot of layers, and the action is suitably tense. Probably the most gratifying thing about the novel is that Hank Searls clearly realized how bad the original screenplay was, and freely added to or deviated from it in order to shape it into a much better story. This will definitely appeal to readers that liked the original 'Jaws' novel, even though it's by a different author. However, good luck finding it anywhere, it's definitely not going to be re-printed any time soon. But if you run accross it at a garage sale or used book store, pick it up."
4,Jaws without Flaws,"I agree with other postings here that the book is better than the movie. The movie lacked consistency, but Searl's novel brought more character and more depth to the story. However, I wished he would stay away from the--how should I say it?--the ""psychological connectivity"" with the shark to Mike Brody (or any of the Brody family). This makes the story seem unrealistic in the sense that sharks seek out revenge on its predators (man)-- especially where Mike says, ""that shark has me tagged."" Despite this minor detail, I found the book exciting. I have the original copy placed on bookstands, and it is still available in bookstores (at least in my area). If you want a copy you might try out a local flea market or ""old books sale"" areas. I have found a number of novels in their original jackets/covers including ""Jaws"" and ""Jaws 2"" to ""The Jaws Log."""
5,The great white terror never ends!,"Hank Searls, author of JAWS 2, once again spins out a novel of ocean terror, this time based on the movie JAWS: THE REVENGE. After her youngest son is killed by a shark in Amity, Ellen Brody travels to the Bahamas to be with her other son and family. The giant shark follows her and continues its reign of terror. There is more action and suspense in this novel than can be found in the movie, and there are also more shark attacks. Michael Caine's character Hoagie is actually a spy sent to the Bahamas to fend off evil drug lords. Along the way, he romances Ellen Brody and helps her family to rid themselves of the shark curse once and for all. This novel is a guaranteed rollercoaster ride of action and thrills!"
2,Good news and bad news,Is it better than the film? Yes. That is the good news.Is that saying much? No. That is the bad.
5,Movie,This is a very hard to find movie. It's one of my favorites and I was very happy to find it. If you like Mae West you will love this movie!
3,Stan near the end,"This is an interesting tape and invaluable to those of us who took Stan Kenton seriously. It was filmed in 1977 before Stan's traumatic head injury. (Still a mystery, by the way.) The band leader was 66, an alcoholic, and overweight. He had lost his verbal eloquence and made a fool of himself by mockingly trying to imitate Clark Terry's swinging jabber. Still, Kenton's musical standards remained extraordinarily high, and this band swings and soars. The trombones, led by veteran Kentonite Dick Shearer, are especially effective; saxaphonist Roy Reynolds is one of several distinguished soloists. And, oh, that crack trumpet section!The quality of this film is minimal, especially in the visual department. But it's something that is a necessary part of the Kenton story. Another night on the road. Near the end of it all."
2,Picky Picky Picky!,Very disappointed! Band lacked fire! You require 15words. I thought I was doing you a favor. No more ratings for me!
5,"Too cool, too cool, too cool!","Why is this guy not a household name?! I can think of no other artist except Louis Jordan who could combine everything from jump, to gospel, to country, to R&B;, to pop, to ballads, and make it all seem so cohesive, effortless and natural! Your foot will be constantly tapping with this CD!Red Foley had one of the most endearing voices I've ever heard. He was considered the ""Bing Crosby of Country"" - and that was only one of his many gifts!"
1,Poor quality,I thought when I first got this cap it looked good until I turned it inside out and where it was tied off the strings are left hanging and the strip of elastic that's woven into the cap is hanging on the outside of the cap by at least an 1/8th of a each. This will definitely not be given as a Christmas gift. I'm really disappointed.
3,Just OK - Small - Tight,"I kind of like this hat - but my wife hated it. She thought it made me look scary. I'm going to try to keep wearing it to stretch it out as it's a bit small and tight. If you're like a skater beanie type person, this one probably isn't for you."
4,surprisingly solid album,"This CD came out in 1998, during the days --- and nights --- when techo-dance was all the rage. Lots of truly great singles from that era, but memorable albums were few and far between. This album, which I think was the group's second, qualifies as one of the memorable ones. It's a surprisingly solid set of soul-spiked dance tunes. With dance and techno music, I always thought the true strength was in the vocals, and K-klass boast several members with good voices. Two of the female singers, Rachel McFarlane and Kathy Sledge, have especially impressive voices, and the one male contributor, Paul 'Tubbs' Williams, holds his own pretty well too. Many of the songs on here remind me of another excellent act from the 90s, M People. If you liked that group, or dance acts like Black Box, you will probably enjoy K-klass as well. Very solid album."
2,more transformer disappointment,"The small transformers from the Robots in Disguise line has been an overall disappointment, and these two follow that trend.Transformation from robot to car is easy enough, but the over fun level is low. these robots are not nearly as 'cool' as the original line of transformers and re-using original G1 names for these toys is insulting.The plastic makes these pieces fairly durable to survive any trip to the bathtub or backyard.If you see these on clearance then pick them up, but they certainly aren't much better than the cheap toys you find at the dollar store. My recommendation would be to buy the bigger transformers."
2,What makes an art film inaccessible ...,"... is the director doing things that mainstream directors wouldn't do, but apparently only for its own sake. I had high expectations going in. But I don't really care how many critics praise this film, or how good the director's sense of composition may be (and I admit that it is), the pace is excruciatingly slow and the acting is generally awful, which ultimately undermines the entire film. Period. There is a fine line between using the lingering camera to capture/express certain ideas and simply engaging in self-indulgence, and in this instance, the director crossed that line so many times in this film that by the time I reached the controversial ending, I just didn't care anymore. If you are looking for a thought-provoking film that is actually worthy of the praise it has received, a slowly-paced endeavor that also offers stunning cinematography, genuinely interesting characters, and no easy answers, I would instead recommend 'The White Ribbon.'"
3,Nice technical effects,"Terribly boring story of a farmer's family ripped off with his male natural urge contradicting a personal religious devotion.So, what was more natural had even a wife of him got a stroke after the affair had been disclosed?"
3,Movie is not in English...,The movie is in some Spanish dialect but it's subtitled in English. The scenery is stunning and it's all very atmospheric. The story isn't especially compelling and it is slow.
1,bad vacuum,"Hepa filters are no easier to change than bags -- and you have to change them twice a year -- [the money] for the filters that's bad value. Vacuum is also heavy and clunky. There are two other filters that need regular changing which is a pain. And after a year and a half, the thing isn't working properly and is probably destined for the garbage. Don't bother with this one."
4,Not Bad for the Money,"I have only had this vacuum for about 6 months. So far, so good. It does tip over easily as someone pointed out, so I purchased a longer hose from Eureka.com. Yes, air from the unit blows dust around, but I've had two very expensive vacuums, A Miele and an Electrolux, that I didn't like as much as this one. When this one dies, I may try a Dyson, but for now, this is acceptable. I never had any clogging, smelling, or broken belts."
1,This is junk,"I purchased this from Overstock.com. I am sending it back this week. I have a long haired cat and a dog. All this vacuum did was ball up the hair and push it around. It picked up some things, but what's the point of a vacuum that doesn't suck up everything?"
1,Terrible!,"I hate hate hate this vacuum!There is a little hose that connects the canister part to the vacuum part that is turned at a 90 degree angle. This stupid thing is so clogged with carpet fiber and trash that I have to take the vacuum apart EVERY time I use it and dig all the trash out of it (both from the top of the hose and from the bottom, by removing the cover). If not, the vacuum collects absolutely nothing in its canister. Such a pain in the butt.Because it has a problem with getting clogged easily, there is also a problem with overheating. I can't get past the living room and into the hall before it overheats and shuts off. Then I have to wait for it to cool. No matter, because by that point, it's time to take it apart and clean out the hose anyway.This is a complete waste of money, I do not recommend it!Now, does anyone have any recommendations for me as to what I should buy to replace this thing?"
1,Get what you pay for,I loved the price on this vacuum when I bought it right after my baby was born. It picked things up well but over heated constantly. I could never get through the whole house without having to take a break. The spring on the bottom stretched out so far it no longer would stay attached and I had to replace it. When we move into our new house it can't handle the new carpet fibers and must be emptied half way through cleaning at least once. Now I have been in our new house a year and owned the vacuum just short of 2 and it won't pick up anything. I have had to take it apart several times to unclog the right angle where the hose attaches. Overall if you have no kids and no pets I maybe would consider this vacuum. But for me it wasn't worth it.
3,Good but no where near 5 stars,"I read this book while at the beach for week. It was a perfect backdrop for a book about incest,poronography,necrophilia,snuff films, murder and hollywood!!! Why was it perfect, well because if I was anywhere else other than the beach I probably would've been depressed to no end. The Shock value of the book ends about halfway after the reader realizes that no character in this book is immune to the seedy undergound life of Hollywood and that really you should expect anything to happen. There's no bright light at the end or anywhere in this story. The main character is driven by desire to be famous, not the death of his girlfriend. He's also one of the sickest people you would ever read about.After awhile you start questioning the dark actions of every character and start to feel like the author is forcing the material to be dark instead of letting the characters and plot grow on their own.This book is worth 3 but not 5 stars."
1,Why I don't buy from Amazon.,This book was advertised on Amazon. I ordered and paid for the book. A few days later I was told the book was not available (even though it was advertised). My money was refunded except for $1.90.So by ordering from Amazon I lost $1.90 and didn't get the book I ordered.
5,Season of Migration to the North,"I highly recommend this book! Salih is an incredible storyteller. Despite having many other things to do, I read this book in two days. It was recommended to me by a friend and collegue who grew up in Sudan. She loaned me the book and now I've logged on to buy my own copy and to gift it to a friend...it is that good! Enjoy."
5,Wonderful Book,This is a great book and I really enjoyed the introduction essay as well. It is a great book if you are interested in African decolonization.
3,A Strained Journey,The journey of Salih's novel is one of investment. A reader can only get out of this novel the equal of what they are willing to put in. In order to truly appreciate this work the reader should preface it by familiarizing themselves with what it means to be Arab and Sudanese. If a basic knowledge of this is developed the book will be enjoyable and spark conversation. If this initial investment is not made the book may not be as entertaining.
1,One Star Too Many: must have missed something -- but what?,"This may well be a ""classic of modern Arabic literature"" as one reviewer has put it -- but does that really say anything? A cart horse in poor flesh with its ribs showing may win a race against the hobbled and the lame.The raving 5-star reviewers are a little like the wide-eyed ladies in Britain whom the protagonist beds in the novel: they praise as an act of pious expiation of First World guilt -- they don't know (or want to know) they've been had by meandering pretentious twaddle masquerading as a book of weighty Third World import.Don't waste your time. NYRB must have put this out as part of its feel-good, do-good list. Amazon's system forces you to give it at least one star just to post a review. That's one star too many."
3,"Overwritten, overrated.","Many of the reviewers here seem to be enchanted with what is an essentially unreadable book. Salih offers a wealth of ""Arabist"" imagery: we have caravans, camels, deserts, palm trees, and all the accoutrements one would expect. However, this intense level of detail simply masks a complete absence of plot or story. The book devolves into an incomprehensible/pretentious enumeration of objects, names, and other ""impressive"" indications that Mr. Salih is a Civilized Man. Think Borges, but about 100 pages too long. If this book were a poem, it would be quite fantastic. I also see some parallels with Walkabout, though that is a far superior work and film. If you would like a resounding affirmation of pseudo-intellectualism and enjoy The New Yorker, you'll love Salih."
1,Nothing Special About It!,"I can only say this: I read the novel, and it didn't touch me or affect me in anyway! I believe a good book should have an impact on the reader, now of course it doesn't necessarily have to cause a dramatic change in the reader's life, but it has to affect him somehow, or at least make him enjoy the reading!But I read this book and I simply could not get the point of it. It was quite boring and it didn't give me anything at all! A sex maniac from Sudan, and then what? A big hidden secret that the author is constantly trying to make you wonder about, and I was actually bored by the author's failing attempts to intrigue the reader! There is simply nothing special about it, as you will read it and forget about it the next day, maybe even the next hour! Some will probably regret wasting their time on this book, wishing they read something else instead."
1,Only one (1! ) star,"Nothing special here. Just a story of a sex maniac from Sudan. Tayeb Salih uses flowery language to address basic themes (such as west vs east cutures) found in most cultural books. For a book this thin, I found it to be pretty disturbing and boring."
3,More Basic Than I Expected,This is a good beginning discussion guide but it is much less thorough or extensive than I expected it to be. Only a very short snippet of the parasha is selected for discussion and there is only a question -- or two -- about it. I expected a more extensive discussion guide than this turned out to be.
2,Misleading,"Very misleading description. ""...Size 2 Two 25 pack"" certainly appears to be 50 envelopes when in fact it is only 25. This makes it very easy to be misled."
5,This is one of my Favorite CD's to this DAY!!,"Snoop puts it down proper on this. You can listen to it from begining to end. Its like a journey, even if u are as high as the Big BOss DOgg when listening to it, u didnt hear this from me but THAT makes it even better. This CD is Oozing Funk.YOu need this in your collection. Snoop is still a excellent artist and a true G!!"
5,One of the Best Experiences of My Life,"This truly was one of the best things I've ever witnessed. The first hour is a stand-up act with a strong political bent. The second half is Mr. Beck's ""stump speech"" - that is, if he would actually save our country and finally run for president already! I laughed, I cried. Beck is hilarious, honest, and heartfelt in his delivery. I left the theater in which I watched this ready to write in Glenn Beck's name for president. I'm not kidding - I just might do it."
1,Glenn Beck - Unelectable,"I usually love Glenn Beck but was disappointed with this dvd. The best part was at the end when he read all the products, etc that were invented in the USA. THAT was impressive!"
2,Not Very Watchable.,"Glenn Beck is one conservative I'm pretty much unfamiliar with. I'm a big Mark Levin fan but had only seen Beck in cable snippets. I heard good things about him though so I gave this video a gander. Politically, he and I are on the same page, but, while I completely agree with his worldview, I do not find him funny. He's just not a natural comedically. Much of his shtick was very hokey and his jokes beat you over the head. His act was banal and fairly low brow in my opinion. He didn't challenge and managed to bore. Sadly, I turned it off after an hour. I'll gladly watch him conduct interviews or take calls from viewers, but I don't think his future is in standup. I wish Glenn good luck though."
1,Beck spews nonsense,"Beck makes most things up. He appears to be a habitual liar. He is also a snide, sarcastic, very unlikeable human being. How anyone can watch this full-of-himself blowhard and serial manipulator for more than about 23 seconds is amazing. Beck appeals to the worst parts of all of us. He tries to make us less than what we are capable of being. Beck hopes we will run to our most base fears, so that people like him can line their pockets.Hey, Glenn: We have your number. Now crawl back into the hole you came from."
5,Everyone should see this video!,"My husband and I saw this show in Columbia, SC. I wasn't really a Glenn Beck fan at the time. Only took the first five minutes of the show to change that. Yeah, we had some laughs over the state of politics in our country, but there was much more to it. I remember leaving the show that night being very proud to be an American! And now I'm truly a fan!!"
5,Very Entertaining!!!,I loved this DVD. I saw the show & I knew I wanted to relive many parts of this very entertaining person.Thanks Glenn!!JMD
1,Willful Ignorance,Glen Beck is proof that there is a large segment of the population in extreme need of a class on critical thinking. Beck is a vile and destructive talking head.
4,Good and Entertaining,The first half of the show was ok. I liked the second half a lot. I really like his CNN show and was happy to get a chance to see him in a comedy show. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Glenn Beck fan. It is worth the price.
4,"Academia, Land, and Power","This collection of sixteen essays discusses problems in western civilization's attempt to educate the indigenous people, Wildcat's term for Native Americans.Wildcat declares ""The Native American still does not fit comfortably or conveniently into western civilization."" He says this is not something that the indigenous people should regret. Each essay is a dialog that begins with explaining the current situation, the western ways, and how indigenous ways could be used to respond to the problems.An example is in the essay of ""Understanding the Crisis,"" Wildcat points out how scientists want to solve the energy crisis with technology. He declares that this crisis cannot be solved by technology alone, but through the philosophy of how we live. This formula is repeated as Delora and Wildcat have an essay-by-essay dialog about the system, how it works, and how it could or should work."
3,Probably not what you are looking for,"I do feel foolish. 300 pages of Moebius is too good to be true. And it was. This is not as I assumed an art compilation of Moebius' most widely known character Arzach: it is in fact a written fictionalised version of what someone imagines Arzach to be. I have not read it - so I do not wish to comment on the quality of the writing. I went through my sci-fi / fantasy stage at puberty, and like puberty, found I grew out of it and it no longer even remotely interests me as a written word genre. I do love Moebius' art though and I doubt I'll grow out of that. This is just a caveat emptor/lector for anyone else assuming they have found a graphic bargain. It may well be an excellent read for all I know. So just so as you know - this is about a dozen Moebius sketches and 300 pages of text.NOTE: I do not blame either Amazon or the vendor for my error - I should have paid more attention, the fault is mine. Service, as always, was superb."
5,WINNING FANTASY,"Escape to the Land of the Morning of Time and watch the good guys win. Ah, but not just your everyday, average good guys; but the good guys with a twist--a special power here, an ancient memory there.As I read this fun, so beautifully illustrated novel, I could feel the frustration of the evil ones, and enjoy the triumph of the Arzach and his kind. And when Arzach and his folks intersect with some surprised, um, Californians....well. What fun!I hope Arzach comes back to us again. Apart from the stories, the artwork is worth studying on its own. And the stories give new meaning to drawings worthwhile in their own right."
1,bulls***,"this is not a book by moebius, this is a piece of s***. the writers deserve to die. enough said."
2,Beware,The picture shows just the foam pad but the discription states this comes with a maple base. The Woodline web site has this part with the maple base for 25% less than you can buy it here.If you buy this all you are getting is the foam part and not the maple base. While the foam part is good I give this 2 stars because the discription is misleading. Buy from Woodline and save a few bucks.
2,Doesn't work well - I found a better one,"I bought this comb for a Maltese and it doesn't work well at all. Although it looks nice (only reason I gave it 2 stars) it doesn't glide through the hair like some others so is pretty much useless. I do have the Safari 7 1/2"" and small 4 1/2"" and they work MUCH better ! The Safari combs run smooth through the dog coat."
4,The Heat Islands,"A sound follow up to White's ""Sanibel Flats"". Interestingly, White chooses to change his style and still makes it work. He adds an environmental flavor and again comes up with a thoroughly interesting story and a great read."
5,Doc Ford is a franchise character,I would like to think that Hollywood is smart enough to discover a good character with franchise potential. Doc Ford would be a great candidate for an entire new tv series or for big screen films. Until then at least those who read the books enjoy the world of Doc Ford and how he ends up in situations that call for his creative problem solving. Always a great read with the Doc....
4,Good e-book.,The Heat Islands by Randy Wayne White continues the Doc Ford series. Randy is a talented author who paints a colorful picture of southwest Florida. His characters are very real-life and his plots contain twists and turns to keep you interested. This e-book (MP3 format) is technically well done. One complaint is that some of the chapters are broken into multiple sections. Overall a good listen.
1,"A talented composer, but not so talented as a pianist ............","There are some lovely tunes here written by Rada, but unfortunately she can't play piano well enough to make them what they should be, and that is doubly true of the limited synths that she uses.She usually plays too fast, with too little nuance. She is an enthusiastic amateur in a world bursting with talented professionals. Composing is her real talent, not playing. Rather than sending her cds to radio stations hoping to get them played, and never finding out that she is not a good enough player to justify that exposure, she should be sending the cds to successful piano recording artists and hoping some of her tunes are picked up. And even more importantly, she should be sending them to film and TV producers everywhere, because film and TV is where her compositions can really shine."
5,Such a funny movie,"Maybe I was in the right mood (perhaps some chemical enhancements), but I loved this film! It's actually more of a drama than a comedy, and you rally care about the actors after getting to know them."
2,"No real story, mostly tedious introspection","Recovering from a case of ""nerves"" in the Scottish Highlands, Grant finds himself obsessed with the death of a young man on the train.Never caught my attention. Grant has no reason to think the death was murder and neither his half-hearted investigations nor his interactions with his friends were interesting. I quit about a quarter of the way through the book. The title was clearly relevant to what story there was. I'm glad this was the last book of the series because otherwise I'd be wondering whether to even continue reading."
3,ok book,"This book is definitely for an advanced reader. It is not a storybook. At times, it can be very hard to follow. The author argues the theory that there was indeed some form of witchcraft, either white or black, happening in Salem. He makes some valid points."
5,a classic,"For years historians debated whether or not the Salem witch trials were the result of hysteria or just simple fraud. The idea that some of the accused could have been in fact guilty had never been seriously argued before. But, like a skilled prosecutor, Hansen laid out the case against several of the witches. Of course, he also realized that innocent people had been condemned as well and showed how that could have happened. If you are looking for a different perspective on the trials, be sure to read this book. Readers may also be interested in my book,Justice At Salem: Reexamining The Witch Trialswhich also offers an alternative theory about what happened in Salem in 1692."
4,Compelling yet Bland,"I give this book 4 stars because I fell for the story. This was definitely a tear-jerker in some respects; the story can grab some of the more casual readers. For a die-hard Banksian or sci-fi/fantasy fan, the book is just a mediocre story with only a menial sci-fi element.This is definitely one of the more emotional stories I enjoyed from Banks (akin to Use of Weapons), but it doesn't compare to the space opera epics such as The Algebraist.I would even go so far as to say that Inversions is an acceptable book for those who typically read fantasy and want to become introduced to The Culture series."
2,Rare Dull Banks Book,"Iain Banks's SF books are dense with astonishingly imaginative settings, well filled-out characters and rapid, complex plotting. Inversions has none of these virtues. It is long, ponderous, and dull. The events are slow and predictable. The characters, flat and with the exception of the two protagonists, nearly indistinguishable. The two protagonists are humorless stand-ins for competing opinions about the proper behavior of members of an advanced civilization toward members of a less advanced civilization. There may be a good book possible from this premise but it would need more disciplined and editing than this one shows. I hope that Banks has not become so successful that he thinks that anything he writes is gold and his editors agree. If so, and this book is an example of the result, we may have seen the last of the Banks magic. I will miss that magic but life is too short to slog through books like this in hopes of finding it."
5,Thoughts on Inversions,Inversions is a great read; two interwoven stories set in medieval worlds with a minor SF subtext. Not what I was expecting from a Culture book though.
1,Boring And Completely Uninvolving.,"As I begin each chapter in Inversions I think to myself..""my god, these characters are boring and this world is unpleasant and dismal. Unless somebody is revealed as a Culture agent and something starts happening I'm out of here.""So far no luck. Not sure if I can finish this one. I do believe this book suffers from the Famous Writer Pulls Old Rejected Manuscripts Out of Drawer syndrome."
3,To little Culture,Like always the story is complex in a good way :-)But the Culture is very subtle through out the book while the story could be read without knowledge of the Culture the conclusion of the story would be very confusing.
2,Horribly written but fairly entertaining,"Don't expect too much from this book. Ms. Bowen does a good job of thinking up interesting, if completely unbelievable, mysteries. With all the experience she's had in writing, one would think she would be able to create lifelike characters who have realistic conversations, but this is not the case. It is not likely that Daniel would be attracted to Molly, and for a supposedly hard-headed, confident Irishwoman, she puts up with a lot of nonsense from him.If you're not overly picky about the style of your books, and want a quick read that doesn't require deep thinking, this is fine."
5,Great Miniseries,"Although I can't say for certain, it would seem that this documentary gets much of it's material from John Keegan's ""A History of Warfare"", which is a pretty good place to start.Read the book while you're waiting for the re-release, a release on DVD, or a re-run on TLC."
1,MUSIC LOVER,HORRIBLE CD WORST CD I HAVE HEARD FROM SNOOP DOGG NO ONE BUY THWE CD ITS A TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT TRUST ME PEOPLE
4,Snoop Is Back,"Snoop Dogg has once again reinvented himself with Paid the Cost...Once a gangsta from the LBC on Doggystyle, Snopp has branched out to ""playa"" status and does it well."
5,Snoop Is Definetly *THE* Bo$$ Playa,"Damn, this album is completely off the hizzook... The tracks that are blazin, in my favorite order, are:Bo$$ PlayaBeautifulFrom Tha Chuuuch To The PalaceSuited & Bootedand everything else!!! Go get this!!!"
1,snoop cd is WACK! A soft production!!,"One of the worst hip hop cd I have ever heard,one or two good songs including dj primo set.Not alot of flow from snoop,the beats were wack,no punch an it seems like no heart was in it.Hip hop is about beats an hopefully a good voice.In this case the beats were weak.I know he can do better."
4,Snoop Is The Boss,"This album indeed has put Snoop back on top of the game. With strong production from the Neptunes and the legendary DJ Premier. Only downfall is I would've like to heard a Dr. Dre beat or two, but I ain't mad at cha Snoop do yo thang."
2,GARBAGE,"this is definitely not snoops best.he barely even wrote any of the songs on this cd.snoop dogg has slipped into the ""poor""category.for example""batman&robin"" is one of the dumbest songs ive ever heard.HOPEFULLY HIS NEXT LP WILL BE BETTER"
4,Clowning...,"""Don't Get Pimp'd Slapped!!!"" Album was straight, still ain't like the first debut but that's alright Snoop is doin his thang...Solid release and hopefully he'll slay another album about Simon *wink* he deserves every single solitary 'clown'...peace."
3,Snoop Dogg still keeping it gangsta!,"Overall, I think this cd reflects a 70's gangsta hip-hop style and beats for the hip-hop community. I really can't compare this one with his last couple of cd's because this one is very different perspective of soul music rather then just headbanger beats. Any Snoop Dogg fan should get this one to add to their epic Snoop Dogg collection. Fa'sizzle you know what I'm tisllin."
3,Good But Not Snoop Good!!,Ok I will admit this CD has great production....I mean the Neptunes are hott right now c'mon!!! Anyways this is a good album for the people who haven't been a fan of Snoop until they found out that he smoked the Mary Jane.If you have been a Snoop fan from the get-go then I think you will be a little dissappointed by this CD. It's just not the Snoop we all know and love. I still think it's worth a listen.Hopes this helps!!! Peace!!!
2,not a damn thing like doggystyle.....,"...for some reason the albums that dre does not appear on are for the most part horrible, this album is no different with the only good songs(2) coming from neptune/premo beats. #4 and #13 are the only songs worth listening to, dre needs to be on snoops albums in order for snoop to make an impactps-ludacris,jay-z and redman don't help this album at allone"
1,Oh my god,"...what is happening with Snoop Dogg? He was a good Rapper in the early '90's... Doggfather was only OK, Da Game was OK, Top Dogg was OK then he take his own Deal, and his last No Limit Album was WACK... and now? I thought it couldn't get worse, but this CD is the worst for years!"
2,Very Disappointing.,"This has got to be one of Snoop's worst. The production on this CD is very poor. The only well produced songs are ""Beautiful,"" ""From Tha Chuuuch To Da Palace,"" and ""Lollipop."" That's not the only reason why this album is so bad though. His rhymes are weak and repetative and become boring. This album is only for really die hard fans. I've been a fan of Snoop since Doggystyle days. Although when he joined Master P., he changed, for the worse. Don't waste you money. If you want GOOD west coast rap, I recommend:Dr. Dre ~ The ChronicSnoop Dogg ~ DoggystyleDr. Dre ~ 2001Xzibit ~ 40 Dayz & 40 NightzXzibit ~ Man vs. MachineWarren G : Regulate... G Funk EraIce Cube ~ The PredatorIce Cube ~ AmeriKKKaz Most WantedIce Cube ~ Death CertificateN.W.A. ~ Straight Outta ComptonThe list goes on but these are my favorites. This album is nothing compared to Doggystyle. I wonder is R&G; is any good."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"After hearing that he was going to release a new album,I was hoping that Snoop Dogg would come back with a nice disc full of hard gangsta stuff and some nice singles. With exception of ""From The Church To The Palace"" I wasnt impressed at all by Snoop's latest release. I think Snoop should do some more Girls Gone Wild videos and then when he's done he needs to get with Dr. Dre and make another great album like he did with ""Doggystyle"". Snoop's still young and theres still time for him to try even harder and make the best album that he can,but a project like ""Paid The Cost To Be The Boss"" wont help him get there."
3,Annoying CD....,"This CD is one of those cds that sound very good when one first listens to them. However, subsequent to hearing each song more than once, the ""circus-music"" beats really get annoying. The only track on this album I really enjoyed was Pimp-slapp'd, because of snoop's dissing of Suge Knight."
2,Tolerable,"This isnt that great of a cd, compared to all his other albums. Their are a few standout tracks, but nothing really new. I would recommend Xzibits new album instead, or if you like the East checkout the crazy ""God's Son"" by Nas. Peace ya' heard?"
1,Wack,"Compared to his first album classic, and even to The Last Meal, this is not a solid record. Snoop relies on guest appearence throughout the album, and gets out-rhymed by Jigga and Redman."
1,On Pop Life-support pass,funny what sounds Groovy&cool too you 10 years back works in that context but if done 10 years later sounds corny&bland.well welcome too Snoop Dogg 2002 who seems stuck in 1992 going by this album.nothing has really changed.yes you have a moment or two but after the 2nd song you are like we been on this ride&circle before.Snoop has been on His Pop Pass for almost a Decade&sadly His Audience hasn't challenged Himself nor does Snoop feel the need too change what isn't Broke but for my ears He needs a New fix.
2,pretty much crap,"mostly crappy. has three good songs. beatiful,from tha chuuch to da palace and what i need f/luda and goldie loc"
5,for all you Haters,"For all you haters paid da cost tobe da boss is his best alblum yet.Bangin songs like beautiful,pimp slapped,papered up,bossplaya and suited and booted.So if all you haters got beef with that youll can come get some you succas."
4,Best Snoop since Chronic 2000...,"GREAT CD!!! I bought Chronic and the 1st Snoop CD...since then I've ""borrowed"" his music via MP3. I heard this CD at my friends house and immediately bought it. Snoop is back! This CD is worth buying...much better than the Master P days...BUY IT!"
2,Snoop's back,"Although this is a good album, it doesnt live up to The Last Meal's standards. He doesn't have as good beats and hooks, and doesn't have Kokane gracing every other song making them funkier than ever. The two neptunes beats he does have are dumb and repetitive. Don't get me wrong, I'm a really big fan of Bigg Uncle Snoop, but the new album comes as a disapointment. My suggestion: if you don't have The Last Meal, get it. It's one of my all time favorite rap albums. And make for damn sure that you have Doggystyle, every song on that thing is a classic. But as for his other No Limit cd's, skip 'em. Unfortunatley, just when I thought snoop dogg was better than ever, his new album is generic as ever, & without the g-funkiness..."
4,You have to let you go,"I didn't like this album at first, but you have to be open for changes, and snoop dogg kept his style and does still HipHop, but he rhymes over new styles of beats and it's perfect while the sun is shining."
2,SNOOP REALLY DISSAPOINTED ME WITH THIS ONE!,"UNFORTUNATELY, SNOOP HAS SLIPPED INTO MEDIOCRITY AGAIN. ON THIS ALBUM, SNOOP TRYS TO SOUND MORE COMMERCIAL, AND NOT TO MY SUPRISE, IT DOESN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL! MANY OF THE SONGS ARE WACK AND JUST DOWNRIGHT BORING. ONLY TRACKS THAT'RE REALLY WORTH CHECKING OUT ARE ''FROM THA CHUUCH TO THA PALACE'', ''BATMAN & ROBIN'', ''THE ONE AND ONLY'', ''PIMP SLAPP'D'' [SNOOP'S DISS TO SUGE KNIGHT], AND ''BALLIN''. OTHER THAN THOSE SONGS, THIS ALBUM WAS PRETTY BORING. PLENTY OF RAPPERS MAKE GUEST APPEARANCES ON THIS ALBUM, INCLUDING LUDACRIS, JAY-Z, WARREN G, REDMAN, AND MORE. BUT EVEN THEY CAN'T HELP MAKE THIS ALBUM ANY BETTER. PLEASE SNOOP, GO BACK TO YOUR OLD STYLE. THIS AIN'T GONNA CUT IT."
2,Snoop's Worst,"Snoop Dogg has proved his abilities so many times that the low quality of this album is more than surprising. If you want to listen to some bangin' Snoop Doggy music, buy literally any other release by the artist, but this one. ""Paid the Cost..."" starts off strong with the two popular singles ""From the Chuuch to da Palace"" and ""Beautiful"". Further on, there are numerous intriguing collaborations with artists such as Warren G, Pharell, Redman, RBX and s.o. Still, the album lacks content; the beats are often hilarious (in the bad way); there are numeous useless skits and countless spoken phrases, aiming to make the album longer. I fail comprehend what pushed an artist of magnitude such as Snoop into writting a track like ""Batman & Robin"". For Snoop Dogg hardcore release collectors only!"
5,Snoop has done it again,Another 5 mic album from Snoop Dogg. This album is just flat out off the meatrack. Dont stop--keep going..
2,JUST GONE DOWN DOWN DOWN since doggy style and the EASTSIDAZ,"i mean, this cd isn't worth buying at all. i cant believe i payed 15 dollars for this. if you ever think about purchasing this, DONT. just download a few of the songs. like ""from the chuuuch to the palace"", ""hourglass"",""the one and only"",from long beach to brick city"", and you got what i want"". i mean if someone is gonna make a 20 song cd, at least make half of it good, then it would be worth considering to buy. but not this, just download some of those songs, or buy DOGGY STYLE or THE EASTSIDAZ if you buy any of his CDS"
2,Snoopy???,"This cd sucks, this is snoops worst album.What happend with snoop?? he can do much better cds.only 5 songs are good: Stoplight,From chuck to da palace,ballin,the one and only and from long beach 2 brick city.This cd isnt worth the money, 1 paid 20 bucks for this crap."
5,Review of Toro Nozzle,"First of all, I can't believe the customer before me gave this one star. His criteria is a joke. This is really what prompted my review. Yes, I have seen two different models of the 12ft nozzle, but they really don't differ that much. One model has the color on top so it is visible even when the sprinklers are off, and the other model must be on or lifted slightly in order to see the colored nozzel. Is it really that hard to remember which nozzle needed to be changed a minute after the sprinklers have turned off? I still can't believe the first review. For anyone looking for this specific model, please do not hesitate to order. It functions 100% as it was designed to."
5,The Definitive Book for the region,"I used this book while trekking the Gossainkund track and found the book to contain all the information I required. It ensured travel was easy and the details on the villages were extremely helpful. I was travelling without a guide and felt there was no need with this book. Well worth the money if heading to this region, though good to have a general Nepal guide if heading to Nepal for the first time as this book focuses on the trekking."
5,Van Til will blow your brain up,"by far one of the smartest man's i have ever read from. this book is a must get, I strongly encourage anyone to get."
5,A crusader for justice,"George Galloway lives up to his usual brilliance in this book.A brilliant orator who dosnt pul any punches.A spade will always be a spade to George.If he was a politician in my country he would have my vote.The world needs to wake up to what is going on, but alas this will not happen as the media has been hi jacked and the public in general are like sheep.To all lovers of truth this book is highly recomended."
1,Idiots to the left of me... Idiots to the right of me...,"Mr Galloway is quite the 'personality.' Please go to youtube and watch the full clip of his support for the suicide bombers in Iraq. It is under= Galloway Praises Iraqi Insurgency (w/ Add'l Real Time Intro). Mr Hitchens is also addicted to being in the media, but wait until he is done and there is a clip from Al Jazeera showing Mr Galloway essentially encourging continued insanity in Iraq- not stability. Hiding behind his glib manner and monologues is a mercenary mind. Remember that he is the author of the book. It is not in his best intrest to be totally forthcomming.Anyone who says there is an easy answer to the middle east problems - crazy. Iraq is the collision of two different delusional world views. Blame to go around. Mr Galloway is wrong and quite probably guilty of profiteering. Don't give him a dime for this book- his retirement fund is in Switzerland."
2,"Dark humor,could use more thought provoking stories.","Thought this book used too many negative incidents, no lessons learned. If you want an original, entertaining, positive and negative look at temping from America's first authored temp (even testified for temps in Congress) read Temporarily Yours by Wendy Perkins. You will love it!"
2,Somewhat exagerated,"I think when writing a book of this type there is always a tendency to exagerate facts and figures in order to make it more dramatic and sell more copies. One case in point: the author says that the 3,000 figure for Jews killed in Zagare is more likely 7,000. Where does she get this figure? According to census records, in 1938 Zagare had 5445 residents, not all Jews. In 1942 it had 2,936 residents, mostly non-Jews. So about 2,509 were killed, not 7,000, perhaps not even 3,000. This of course does not make the crime any less horrendous. But let's stick to facts, please."
5,WINNER,"Congratulations Rose Zwi's book Last Walk in Naryshkin Park is the Winner of the Sliver APPA Award, category General Literature, in Beijing, China for the translation from English to Mandarin of Last Walk in Naryshkin Park"
4,works fine,Laser cartridge gives satisfactory use given the cost. I get about 3200 copies per toner cartridge.
1,Ordered Samsung Cartridge received Compatible Cartridge,I ordered a Samsung cartridge from TripleNet and they shipped a non-samsung compatible cartridge. Not cool because the product info says 'by Samsung' and if I wanted an aftermarket cartridge I would have ordered a cheaper one. Requested an RMA and return label.
4,Great Cartridge!,"Clear, crisp and dark quality output. Easy to install, prompt delivery and easy instructions to install."
5,Samsung ML 1210 printer cartridges,Excellent service and received the cartridges in a timely fashion. They appear to be genuine Samsung products which is definitely a plus.
2,Not the Samsung brand,"This is NOT the Samsung brand name. It is advertised as though it is. If you're a label lover, then do not get this product. If you want a similar product, then this is it. It works fine."
1,Product is not new -- it's recycled!,"Buyer beware! This product (ML-1210D3) was shipped with an obviously used packaging -- with the UPS tracking number for the original purchaser still in the box! This is a scam sale!!!Don't buy this item! No wonder, Amazon is selling it for much less than the normal price of a NEW item.Very disappointed, ramida"
2,Delivery time,"Can't depend on USPO delivery, is the worst. They charge for 3 day delivery and take a week."
4,Excellent Casting -,"Oliver Twist"" does justice to a complex book. This version was released in 1948 and keeps in the spirit of the book. It follows the fortunes of young Oliver (John Howard Davies). We see his unhappy years at the orphanage under the watchful eye of the Beadle (Francis L. Sullivan) to his association with boy thieves under the thumb of Jewish money-dealer Fagin (Alec Guinness).The casting is overall excellent. Nancy is played by Kay Walsh, and Robert Newton plays a menacing Bill Sykes. Diana Dors does well as Charlotte the maid and Anthony Newley makes the Artful Dodger come alive with his mixed motives.Oliver has a difficult life, from the time he is born in Victorian England. His mother dies in birth and the boy ends up in a workhouse, then a gang of pickpockets. The movie and book focus on poverty and the miseries it encompases; degrading lives through hunger and want and showing crime as one way out.The sets are impressive as well as the characters."
5,All character actors should see this at leat ten times,"It's three must-see lessons in character-acting:Anyone who thinks Alec Guiness can only play nice hasn't seen this. (Also must see KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS where he plays eight characters including an active guy in his early twenties, an old man frozen by Parkinsons' Disease and a woman.)Robert Newton. Known for saying ""Arrrrrrgh, Matey!"" To see how incredibly versatile he was, compare this terrifying Sikes to his performance in Hitchcock's JAMAICA INN, where he plays what should be a flashy good-guy as a crashing bore.Francis Sullivan uses fat comedically as well as anyone like Jackie Gleason or John Goodman. In fact the only better demonstration of the fat-guys' craft I can think of is Sydney Greenstreet. OK, Robert Morley too."
1,Until when?,"2010.... for the David Lean collection! My God, by 2010 DVD will be out of service (hope don't). But wait until then for OLIVER, MADELEINE and the other great movies is a very bad joke."
5,"Mary, Dis You Know?: The story of God's Great Plan",This is a beautiful hard covered picture. The illustrations are stunning and the biblical quotes add a special touch. The story provides an understanding of some of the questions that we think Mary may have had when being chosen to be the Mother of Jesus. A book I feel every child or family should have.
2,Unexpected...,"This ring is much narrower than we expected - looking at the photo I thought it would be at least 3 mm....they are much thinner & the diamonds are teeny tiny. I ordered two, one for each side of my engagement ring. Didn't like it, sent them back."
