3,I expected more...,"Given the hype surrounding this book, I expected to be ""wow-ed"" by it - but I wasn't. Certainly, I found the historical details interesting and it was enlightening to learn about the life of a geisha. Still, the characters seemed so stereotypical and one-dimensional to me. In addition, I found the the plot, particularly the ending, to be way too contrived and predictable."
2,BETRAYED!,"Arthur Golden painstakingly made this book appear to be a true story. I was so taken into Saruyo's life that I was completely devastated to learn, only at the very end, that the entire story was fictional. The book jacket and ""translator's note"" are extremely deceiving. I'm sorry I ever got so involved in the characters."
5,Touching,"It was so real, I could hardly believe it was written by a Caucasian man. I felt I was living in the Nitta okiya and going to parties along with Sayuri. Very impressive."
4,Closer to four than to three stars.,"I would have given this book 3.5 stars if it was possible, but I guess it deserved four. It is a very captivating look into the private lives of geisha just before WWII. Mr. Golden manages to pull this off beautifully. Not exactly a page turner, but a wonderful book to read. Bravo!"
2,Shallow and overly pleased with itself,The main character was the least interesting one I'd ever encountered; no original thoughts and no personality. There's no incentive to keep reading when I simply don't care what happens to her! This realization made the author's note even more jarring; his inflated sense of her seems just to reflect his misrepresentation of himself and his abilities.
5,Loved!,"Yes, there were a lot of typos in the Kindle version, however, it doesn't distract from the story. Well written and worth a read."
4,Good Book/ Nice Seller,"I had ordered this book a while ago and it got lost in the mail. I contacted the seller and they sent out another book right away free of charge. The second book got to me very fast and it is in good condition. After I read the book then I can write a review on it.Im just excited now that Ive actually received it, I can wait to read it!"
4,One of my favorites,I really couldn't put this book down. Well written and compelling story with lots of (well explained) cultural references.
3,falling star (goes from 4/5 to a 2),"I really enjoyed the book at first... well, for most of it, honestly. I was actually believing it might actually be based on a true story after all-and if it wasn't it was at least superb story telling.Then the ending comes along, and it is SO RIDICULOUSLY FAKE and Happy la-la-land ending the way things so suddenly fall into place, that it annoyed me, and I was glad the book was almost over.I'm all for happy endings, but the ending must be congruent with the beginning. This book felt like it switched genres at the end; it was an intriguing, cultural story of struggle and determination, and then it decides to be a dime-a-dozen romance novel."
3,Less than what I expected,"I had heard great reviews about this book, so I bought it. My friend and I absorbed it within a weekend, and we each agreed it was neither satisfying nor believable. The beginning of the novel was promising -- it has some interesting metaphors and the girl's story was mesmerizing. Then there was the oh-so-promising conflict bwtween the two beautiful geishas. It began with a band, and just sizzled out by the end of the novel. But what destroyed this novel was the fact that it was way too obvious than the author, a man, was trying to write as a woman. He was clumsy and unrealistic when it came to the sex scenes; he probably should have consulted his wife at this point and asked her what it was like to lose her virginity. Anyway, it was an interesting book, but it did not live up to its expectations."
5,One of the best....,This was one of the best books ever written. Arthur Golden's sentences are like water flowing down a quiet stream. Recommended reading...
5,Along with the 2000+ reviews,"I don't know if my words will make a difference or not, compared to the fact that millions of people have read and wrote reviews about this book. However, this book definitely told the story of a young geisha who somehow took control over her own destiny. She was a courageous young girl who loved strong, stood to what she believed, and fought for things to be right. Golden wrote an amazing story of the geisha life. Everything he wrote seemed so factual that you wouldn't even question as to was this fiction or non-fiction. I felt as if I were walking alongside young Chiyo, then geisha Sayuri all through the book. It was an amazing feeling as you read the story because it was just so captivating, and you feel involved in the story. The entire book was awesome. The movie wasn't too bad either. Obviously in a book you develop your own imagery somewhat, but the movie did a good job in telling the story. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of both!"
5,Simply can't put it down,"I simply love this book. My best friend introduce this book to me and I was like 'huh'.. why do I need to read about the boring life of geisha in the olden days of Japan? Oh, how wrong I was. I am glad I read it with her persistency. If you simply enjoy reading autobiography, this one is for you. It tells the life of Sayuri, of how she ended up being sold to a Geisha house and how she survived in that place. She made it to being one of the successful geisha and this didn't come easy as she has a rival, Hatsumomo who is constantly making life difficult for her. The life of Sayuri is full of ups and downs and we get to learn the Japanese culture in this book. Read this book, I strongly recommend."
5,An Extraordinary Book,"The book Memoirs of a Geisha was extraordinary. The characters captured my heart and the feelings of the geishas were explained so well that I felt as if I were also a geisha. I felt that I was next to Sayuri throughout the whole book, and her character was so real. The situations that the geishas go through are so attention grabbing and make you want to help the geisha through her problems.This book has many good parts, yet some parts that are not very appropriate for certain people. I think I would recommend this book to people who are at least in high school. The book is great, but some parts would not be suitable for young children in elementary or middle school. I would also recommend this book to those who like Japanese history and historical fiction. Also this could be a good read for people who enjoy biographies or autobiographies."
2,Orientalist academic memoirs of a geisha,The generally rave reviews about this book are a little misleading. Many people will try to sell you on its authenticity. I would have prefered reading about the culture of the geisha from the perspective of a Japanese writer rather than an American academic ( the author is a professor in E. Asian studies.) The book doesn't breathe under the western fascination with the minutia of every fold of every garment of the geisha wardrobe. I have a hard time believing that we couldnt wait for a Japanese told chronicle of the same story.
3,"Strong until the end, but then it falters","This is an extremely readable and detail-filled fictionalization of the life of a geisha in both pre- and post-war Japan. I found it to be a very sensitive portrayal of a young woman's quest for peace in the face of great adversity. Unfortunately, the novel, for me anyway, begins to fall apart once the central villain, a rival geisha, is defeated. You quickly realize that the drama is gone, and the next 100-150 pages drag on without the dynamism of that conflict."
2,Overrated fodder,"It's impressive what Arthur Golden has done with this book. I wouldn't have believed that a middle-aged white man could actually write convincingly through an adolescent japanese girl's point of view. The intricate details of the geisha life described by Golden is impressive, along with his knowledge on the subject matter. However, it almost seems superfluous at times, almost to the point of pretentiousness. The story is simplistic with predictable plot turns. The heroine is a modern feminists' nightmare. I kept expecting to see the girl grow up to see herself, and the people around her, for who they really are. But then again, maybe that was Mr. Golden's point. Overall, I think the book is good for wasting time. It's akin to one of those feel-good summer blockbusters which leaves you with nothing but a few, somewhat memorable images and an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. If you're looking for substance, this isn't it. If you decide to read Memoirs, skip the last chapter."
1,Neither history nor fiction,"This book was introduced to me as good historical fiction. It is neither good history nor good fiction. This book seems to be written by a person smitten by Japanese culture. The author seems to be so interested in talking about the culture that he forgets to build a story with depth and meaning. While the main characters have some depth, the rest seem to be more caricatures than real people. The plot line is all too predictable and offers no surprises."
5,I opened the book and didn't put it down until I finished it,"A friend told me six months ago to read this book. I frankly didn't think I'd like it, I ordered it because I was running short on books. It's wonderfully written. A charming book, I kept waiting for the author to stumble, he never did. What a wonderful talent. The story is interesting but the true charm of this book is the authors ability to weave his story around you until you are unable to put the book down."
5,Intriguing,I read this a few years ago and still recommend it to people. A delightful book the presents a lost culture.
2,I wanted to like it,"This book had it's up and downs, but was ultimately very slow-paced. It is OK if you don't mind reading 5 pages about walking down a dirt road or observing a rock on a sidewalk, to put it one way. The writing is good and even humorous. The author is impressive in his ability to relate events from a woman's perspective.I could not get pulled in and would never have finished it, were I not required to read it for a bookclub.I, too, was disappointed that there was not more emphasis on the ""art"" of being a geisha. Also, the back of the book mentioned that she had to find a new life after the war and the geisha houses closed, but she just took up being a geisha again ultimately. That didn't seem like any great new freedom or beginning.I can see why people found it interesting, but if it doesn't grip you after the beginning, don't look for it to improve."
1,"Sorry to say, I couldn't get past the first two chapters.",What is all the raving about. It's hard to enjoy a book when you have no interest in the characters.
5,Kept My attn,A page turner! i love the narrative method it is written! it allowed me to visualise each event! written very simple and definatly a page turner!
5,Riveting!!!,Golden struck gold on his first time out. This book will draw you in from it's first page and take you inside a world you never knew exisited. An instant classic and I'm waiting with baited breath (perhaps foolishly so) for the movie. I'm hoping Hollywood gets this one right. But if you haven't read this book...don't wait another day. Click on 'add to cart'. You won't be sorry.
1,reviewers prose indicative to credibility of their rating.,"Just an observation; notice how the prose of the reviewers, that so gratiously, submitted their 5 star ratings...their own insightful review parallelled the authors writing. There is a difference between prose and prozaic. The reviewers that were OVER-generous with ONE star, have the intelligence and sardonic wit, as demonstrated cleverly in their reviews, that they will learn to stay away from the bestseller list. As for me, after 10 pages, I concluded that he's not a writer- maybe a storyteller, but mostly a typist. I'd rather watch paint dry."
1,Depressing,"An extremely disappointing and pedestrian novel that simply does not warrant the media hype it has received. The language is flat and without depth. The prose is mundane. A good editor would have cut the redundant sentences and tightened the narrative. This story of severe child abuse and misogyny is not redeemed by moral insight or cultural lesson. If it hadn't been a bookclub selection, I would have set it down after the first three chapters and spared myself the sickening sense of voyeurism that comes with witnessing senseless human cruelty."
1,"A fake book. Two dimensional as a novel, superficial as res","A fake book. Superficial research invalidates it as serious inquiry or social science writing, thin, two-dimensional plotting and characterizations place it low on the fiction food-chain. Genuinely conceived, resonating novels spring from somewhere real; on some level, at some point they are felt. We care about Jane Eyre; Golden's pasteboard characters mean nothing to us and, we suspect, even less to him, except perhaps as the ticket to a best-seller with an exotic theme. One doesn't even learn that much about geishas -- the facts are sprinked thru bumpily like raisins in dough. The reviewer who compared it to a bodice ripper got it right (one could add, a rather palid one...and those ever-returning grey eyes...I remember a Harlequin Romance that featured grey eyes...) Real research, real writing, real passion, real wit: not here."
3,It's okay.....,"I guess I've just heard so many people rave about this book that I just expected something more. For the first half of the book, I could harldy put it down in the beginning, but somewhere in the middle, I lost interest and had to struggle to finish. I can't exactly put my finger on the reason. I think it may have been a combination of things. One, after Sayuri is no longer an apprentice, I think her character loses something. You see her transform from a humble woman with a good work ethic into a pampered brat who in my opinion, lives a very shelterd life with no regard for others. I have to give away more of the book in order to go on, and I don't want o ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it yet, but I think those of you who have read it know exactly what I'm talking about."
5,Higly Recommended! Five Stars!,"Since I was interested in Japanese culture, I purchased this book because of the title and topic. However, I am not much of a reader, so I didn't have time to read it. I lived in Kyoto, Japan (the setting of the book) for a short time and recently returned. Since I had some free time now, I decided to read this book. I thought the story was very mesmerizing and I stayed up the whole night reading. I just couldn't put it down because I had to know what was going to become of the main character. Even though it was a fictional story, I felt as if I were reading a biography of someone's actual life. The descriptions of the setting, characters, and culture matched those of what I had actually saw and experienced during my stay in Kyoto. But, even if a reader didn't know anything about Japan or Japanese culture, you can still enjoy and understand the story. I highly recommend this novel!"
3,interesting story,"with all of the hype this book has gotten, i couldnt wait to read it. i found the intimate view of japanese culture to be very interesting. i also found that my perceptions of a geisha were incorrect.while i did enjoy this book, and developed an appreciation for japanese culture, i did not find the book to be the page-turner i thought it would be.however i still recommend it; if not only for an interesting peek into the daily life of an apprentice-turned-geisha."
3,All right...,"The book was all right. It didn't appeal to me, that's all.Oriental culture isn't foreign to me. I am Chinese, I've seen Oriental culture, I'm nearly suffocating in it, etc. I personally think this book draws much of its charm from its exotic setting, much like pioneer novels did for East Coast city-dwellers when America was younger.But despite its exotic settings, the book keeps a distinctly Western flavor. It seemed like it looked at the geisha life through a Western-tinted lens of wonder--which is fine, really, but IMHO, it's lacking the ""feeling"" of Japan. It doesn't feel like Japan, it feels like a Japanese movie set built in Southern California.Otherwise, it's lovely. The writing is gorgeous and the character development especially is excellent. I'd still recommend it, just for a good and enjoyable read."
5,This book put a lot into perspective.,"This captivating story is not only brilliantly written, but also deeply inspirational. It is not a love story, but a story of survival.Excuse me while I give away the (perfect) ending:'But now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean. Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too often they bleed into a wash, just like watery ink on paper.'"
3,A Well Written Danielle Steele,As a lover of historical fiction I truly enjoyed Golden's portrayal of what it meant to be a geisha in pre-WWII Japan. But when the main character decided to put everything on the line for love it just screamed cheesy romance novel that I had a hard time finishing the last 100 pages. Read it for the sense of time and place but leave reality at the door.
1,Never use this seller,"This book was rated in ""like new"" condition. It smelled like the seller went to their great, great, great Grandmothers very damp cellar to send us this book. It smells so bad my daughter can hardly breathe when she reads it. It was not even worth the penny I paid for it & it does not deserve the 1 star rating. I'm sure glad my daughter doesn't have asthma, she wouldn't be able to read it. The only positive thing about this seller is it came in a timely mannor."
1,Don't buy this book.,"I usually try to refrain from buying a book when it's a bit too popular, and I should have followed my own guidelines this time. I'm very sorry but I just had to say that this was the most boring thing I've ever read in my entire life, and I read everything! I took it to the beach with me last year and it almost ruined my vacation it was so bad. There's no action, no sex, no character development, nothing happens, you don't find out any of the good stuff, please don't waste your money."
2,Memoirs of a Geisha,"I find it very hard to believe that in the 30s and 40s the Japanese culture, one of the most esteemed cultures in the world, would train young girls for the exclusive pleasure of men."
1,"Absolutely nothing imaginative, bad writing","Yes, I did finish this book. I am a 27 year old female, conservative, college educated, and I have read a few good books. This was certainly not one of them. Characters are so simplified, either ""GOOD"" or ""BAD."" I felt as if I were reading an essay of some nonimaginative woman who was trying to make everyone feel sorry for her. Just because it made it to a bestseller list, does not mean it is worth reading. Jerry Springer's show was popular too but we all know how 'good' that was. This book is in the same category.Do not waste your time on this book, I felt sorry I did."
1,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Book binding is extremely poor on the original and the replacement book. Pages look like they have been cut by a blind man who has had a whiskey or seven. Manufacturing process is very bad and no body checks what they send out. In addition, if I could have left `no stars' for the review I would have but Amazon do not allow `0' stars, extremely unprofessional."
2,A forgetable book,"My book group chose this book and I was quite excited as I usually enjoy books that focus on cultures other than my own. I am not quite finished and probably wouldn't choose to finish if not for my group. I care very little for any of the characters, the conflicts are not well developed, and the description of Japanese culture is weak. There is so much more I would like to know about this culture and these lives - the depression, the war, the social structure. It all seems so ""surface"" and generally unsatifying."
3,"Easy reading, interesting story.......","I enjoyed this book for its information about a subject that I never knew I would find so interesting. I can't say that I found any aspect of ""Geisha"" overly rapturous, but it was sort of book that you can read without much trouble. A high-brow potboiler........"
3,Worth reading,This is a fascinating peek into a culture most of us don't know. It is unfortunate that the ending was so weak. I can only think that Mr. Golden was thinking about movie rights and ended a good story as poorly and unrealistically as most Hollywood movies.
2,Disappointed,I was captivated with the story until the last quarter of the book when the detail became too tedious and the choices the characters made became too cliche. I'm mad I spent so much time on this long book when I could have been reading something of substance. Too corny.
3,Very Overated..,"I find it hard to believe that Speilberg is making a film out of this. It's an easy read, but then again so is a Harlequin novel.It looks into the submission of women in the Japanese culture of the time, and makes you wonder how much of that still exists."
3,The Perils of Pauline in a Kimono,"Although I read this book for 3 nights straight, and finished it, I was very disappointed. Since this was a ""memoir,"" I expected the character to speak to us from the perspective of someone who was looking back at their life. All the characters were so two dimensional and we never really got into the heart of any of them. Great descriptions of clothing, hairstyles and locations, but I found little which took me into the soul of the geisha life. A good book for vaction reading, but I certainly would not call it any kind of a great novel."
4,"A touching, educational story","What strikes me about this novel is the vast amount of information it contains. Western readers often have difficulty unterstanding the intricacies of Japanese culture, and Golden has wonderfully revealed the beauty, and reality, of a Geisha's life in an interesting and lyrical story. It's a must-read for anyone ready for a different type of fairy tale."
5,it seems frighteningly real,"My mother is from Kyoto and always told me stories about geishas. She told me how they walk, what classes they take, what they do...This book brought back lots of memories. I recommend this book because most of the situations that are told in the novel is true. I like this book because for one thing, the author clearly did his homework and did it well. Secondly, it doesn't have all these silly sex parts in it like those romance books that are without depth. I recomend this book because I can visualize everything that is written clearly...Just as if my mother was telling me about geishas again."
2,More Pb than Au,"It is, at least, mind stultifying to read an amazon.com review whose writer finds it necessary to explain that ""geisha"" does not mean ""prostitute."" While the CBS smotherage of the Winter Olympics was wall-to-wall cultural arrogance and ignorance, surely America outside of the air-heads of the electronic media is more aware than you amazonians think!"
5,Japanese culture at its best,"Golden wasn't afraid to use all the raw elements in life in his writing, which made this novel what it is. His clear division of sex and love stuck me as flawless, and drew me closer to his characters.I felt he could have forshadowed or built up the ending a bit more, or at least given it a sad turn.Other than that, It was an excellent read and I'd read it again."
2,Disappointing and cartoonish,"I'm so glad to see that I am not the only person in the world who didn't like this book. The descriptions of the geisha life were interesting (assuming they are true - after all, this IS a work of fiction), but the characters generally were one-dimensional (either good or bad), the dialogue unbelievable, and the plot was like a badly-written soap opera. I plowed through it, but it really was not a very good book."
3,"Good, but could've been better.","I read the entire novel in one sitting because I *had* to find out what happened at the end. I was disappointed. My enthusiasm slowed to a complete halt as the book started to resemble a soap opera (dashes of history sprinkled as necessary). The ending was altogether too ""convenient"" for my liking. If Golden had AVOIDED the neatly packaged ending, the story would have been more convincing and memorable. Loose threads leave you something to floss your teeth with."
5,Truly Fantastic,"This book is vibrantly and honestly written you find yourself feeling the textures, smelling the aromas and being lost in another world and time. The story of a girls journey to first a geisha and then to a woman is written in a form that is universal.The most amazing thing was that a man was able to write the in such detail the emotions and anxieties of a complicated woman with such accuracy. I could read this book time and time again and still find myself wistful for more."
3,a disappointment,"I loved most of this book. But I found deeply disturbing the one dimensional characters of the ""good"" people and the ""bad"" people. I would have liked to have seen Golden develop his characters more. It was a great book to learn about geishas, but if you know anything at all, the lack of character development is sorely missed."
4,What a Surprise!,"I am usually a fan of science fiction and fantasy fiction, but this book took me by surprise! I'm fascinated by Asian history so it seemed interesting at first glance. The entire time I was reading the book I was captivated...What a compelling tale of such an interesting life...until the end when I relized it was fiction! It crushed me! I'm in love with this book. It is a satisfing read...if not slightly predictable in the end...but lots of fun!"
3,"what, exactly, is all the fuss about?","sometimes I think if enough people rave about a certain thing, others are hesitant to express a different opinion, lest they are seen as ""wrong"" or, worse, having not ""gotten it""-- that is, the point of the book. Well, I'm sorry, but after hearing so many people proclaiming this novel as the best ever, I didn't expect to disagree. But, I do. This novel was okay. Period. The characters seemed shallow, the plot was... well, to be honest, I can't think of one. It was slightly on the boring side as well. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money on it!"
1,Major Disappointment,"My Book Club chose Memoirs of a Geisha to read this month, so I was looking forward to the read, and was majorly disappointed. The little cat fighting and tricks the in-training geisha did to each other were so trite and sophomoric. It seemed like a man's idea of what women do to each other, and I found it insulting--not to mention shallow, flat and poorly written. I was hoping for a rich, many layered history and story of what, I am sure, is a respected and artistic endeavor unique to the Japanese culture. Instead, I read about silly squabbles a la Joan Collins and Linda Evans on Dallas! Too bad."
4,Meticulously Researched and Wonderfully Written,"I had my doubts and reservations, but Arthur Golden has made me a believer. His writing is beautifully crafted and truly felt genuine. He has treated the subject matter with class and came out remarkably interesting."
4,Good first glimpse into the world of geisha -,"This book, despite its many flaws (above all the less-than-fair descriptions of Japanese male characters), is a good attempt to shed light on the often mysterious and misunderstood world of geisha.Geisha is a form of art and an eloquent expression of culture - not a high-class call girl service many Westerners' wishful thinking has led them to believe.The author quite capably describes Sayuri's life as an artist and an embodiment of amazing tradition."
5,Mezmorizing!,"I am one of those people who takes forever trying to find the right book to read, one of those people who don't take much interest at all to even care what beholds in a book--but when I saw this book, I was blinded by the mysterious and enchanting spells. I am telling you from the very bottom of my heart that you cannot ignore or forget about the beauty of one's story."
5,An intricately woven masterpiece,"I finally finished reading ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and now I am wishing for more. Arthur Golden does an amazing job of describing, to the smallest detail, the life and culture of Geisha in Japan. This story is so full of detail and remembrance that you forget it is fiction altoghether.The story of Chiyo/Sayuri's life from childhood to elderly woman is often heartbreaking and yet filled with hope all at the same time. Just when you expect a certain outcome, and long for another, you are surprised by what really occurs, and just how you feel about it.I highly recommend this book. I was less than interested when it was recommended to me, but I agreed to give it a shot. I am so glad I did!!"
4,fascinating,"To me, the most incredible thing about this book is that it was written by a man! The author writes so well from a female viewpoint that I had to keep reminding myself that the book was not written by a woman. Learning about the whole geisha culture was extremely interesting, and the plot is well-developed. I was slightly put off by the ending - it is not quite as believable as the rest of the book. However, that did not at all diminish my enjoyment of the novel. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" to anyone, male or female. A great book."
5,A Wonderful Read,"Golden takes one into a little understood and little knownworld, even for Japanese. Exposure to Geisha's is far too expensive forthe average Japanese and Golden's book gives an insight to it. Wonderfully crafted, with a totally real ending."
5,A book that draws you right into the world of geisha,"From the very beginning, I was completely drawn into this book. Nitta Sayuri's life, though fiction, is fascinating. The book is even more enthralling knowing that Arthur Golden spent so much time researching geisha culture before writing it, so you know it is based on fact."
5,Captivating! I was addicted to reading this book!,"I have never gotten so involved in reading a book the way that I did with this one. I did not want it to end. Not only was the plot interesting, but I learned a great deal."
1,Stay away..,"Seriously, I am still clueless why this book got so many folks raving about. This is one of the most boring books I have read. There is nothing in this about Japanese culture other than explaining how to stitch, press and wear a 'Kimono' (literally atleast about 50 pages of this book talks about kimonos). And if anything I would consider this book to be derogatory about the Japanese because the only way Japanese gents are shown in this book is idling, drinking, ranting while some poor girl (geisha) tries her wits on him for the money she has got. In fact I disliked it so much that my review might feel as if I have a grudge on the author. Stay away from this or read it yourself to see what I mean.-Santhosh."
3,memoirs of a geisha,"I thought that this this book was slow paced and pretty much boring. I kept reading hoping that something exciting would happen- which wasn't often. Sayuri's life was so unfortunate! I would've liked more good things to have happen to her. Although I did enjoy an indepth look into the Japanese culture which I had never experienced, I wouldn't reccomend this book."
5,Beautiful,"From the moment I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. I loved it. I was a little upset by the ending though. It seemed too rushed and although Sayuri got what she wanted, I was upset by what she had to do to obtain it. Not on a moral basis, but the way the Minister was described both before and during, it almost made me sick to think about it. Now I can go see the movie! I highly recommend it!"
3,"Not very well written, but very well told","Don't expect wonderful English sentences or great literary prowess, the book doesn't have it. Then again, it is written in the way of a memoir of a geisha.The book could have been a little better with some more depth, a better look into the main character.It is the best book however to get a good view on how the world of the geisha worked. A fascinating, sometimes hard for us to understand, world of girls who start learning at an early age (sometimes 3 already). If you are interested in this aspect of Japanese culture, this novel is a must."
4,exotic memoir,"I think this is a reasonably interesting and challenging read, though it is wordy. I thought the recollections of the World War II era and the other historical sidelights added to my knowledge. I thought the first half of the book, in which the girl is torn away from her family in her little fishing village (also from her sister),while very sad, was a little better- told than the second half, though this is actually a straight line success story, from abject poverty to great success, since in the latter half of the book her relationships are with notably successful Japanese businessmen. Her apprenticeship, beset by jealousies, was interesting, with its many informative pages about the geisha's necessary talents, such as dancing and tea-service. There are many scenes in teahouses throughout. Her elaborate coiffure, while not comfortable for her, also caught my interest. The book is tediously wordy, however. I thought the scenes with the baron were amusing."
3,This is not a five star book!,"I was given this book to read as part of my summer reading list for school. While many would say this is a much to sexual and erotic book for a 15 going on 16 year old to read, i found it not as racy as many of the books i have read. What i did find though was a captivating beginning to the book but a rather let down of an ending. By then end of this book i thought that i should be happy for Sayuri but the character seemed to be so immoral and lacking that i couldn't feel happy for her. Thoughtout the book i didn't have the slightest feeling of pity for Sayuri who didn't seem to see anything wrong with her abusive surroundings. The whole book was depressing. But On the other hand I did learn more about Geisha and thier way of life."
1,memories of better books keep coming to my mind,"As a youth I enjoyed reading Clavel's Shogun as well as C.W. Nicol's Harpoon. Bonchi and Musashi are other novels of early Japan I enjoyed.So I didn't think twice about picking up a copy of this book. I regret I payed so much for it even though it was on sale. Fortunatley, a used book store offered me a good trade.Poorly written and quite booring. Ten years of research may have provided the author with ample facts to assemble. but he should have spent more time developing a style with which to write it. It gave me no feel for the main character or her life. Lifeless and colorless best describes this book.I hope the screen writer is better with the movie than the author was with this book. I highly doubt I will watch it except briefly on TVThe only good thing is that like Titanic which was a good film and the recent Pearl Harbor which was a turky it causes interest in the geisha and the time period from which they came."
3,NOT A TRUE STORY,"I felt tricked at the end of the book. With the detailed translators notes at the beginning of the story about how Sayuri's story was dictated by her and the fact that there was no mention until the very last pages of the book that Sayuri's character and life were completely invented, I had read the whole book thinking that I was reading a work of nonfiction. This book was recommended to me by a local book club and they all had read it and thought it was nonfiction (it's very easy to miss those last pages). The statement that the main character and story are fictitious needs to go in the front of the book."
1,The book is better than the awesome movie of same title.,I bought the book for my granddaughter to read and do a book report on then I bought the movie both of which we loved.
2,read this with a sceptical eye,"I first read this book 5 years ago when I knew very little about Japan, its cultures and geiko themsleves. On first read, it is an appealing book because it allows you into a foreign, unknown world, through the eyes of a geiko.HOWEVER - some of the language Golden uses is ridiculous, with many americanisms thrown in for good measure. The ridiculous metaphors and similies used made me feel irritated at some points. I even saw some spelling mistakes!If you're looking for a truthful, entertaining read, get Minkeo Iwasaki's book instead - written by a japanese woman, who was a geisha!A mildly entertaining book, until you realise that most of what is written is some middle aged, american man's fantasy!"
4,well.....the ending is weak,"the story was well-written. what i found to be the most enjoyable is learning about the culture of geisha women. it was hard to put the book down. however, the ending was too predictable and i had a hard time finishing the last few pages, knowing there would be no surprises. i would definitely recommend the book but have no desire in reading it again."
1,Soap operatic fluff,"So yeah, the guy reads, speaks and writes Japanese; that does not mean the novel is therefore unassailable. It reads like a romance novel. How anyone can classify this as a stunning work of modern literature is beyond me.I found the book insipid."
5,Gloriously haunting,Memoirs of a Geisha is a beatuifully descripted book showing the harsh reality of a strange and unusual world. This book makes you think about what you have in life and the simple things what others would love to have - freedom being the word that comes to mind
3,"It was okay, but not great","I really enjoyed the first portion of the book, but as she moved into adulthood, she actually became less mature and developed into a vain woman. After all she had been through, she used and then crushed the man who truly loved her in order to pursue the Chairman. She even betrayed the older geisha who had taken her under her wing and made her into a success. I ended up not liking her at all!"
5,"Captivating, Excellent Job Of Evoking Japanese Culture",I have to keep reminding myself that an American white man of the second half of the 20th Century penned this remarkable book about a Japanese woman of the first half of this century. It is a triumph of insight into another culture with its entirely different (or perhaps not so different) mindset and values.
1,Yeesha! Am I alone here?,"I must admit that I'm confused about the appeal of this book. I'm reading it as part of a book club, and never have I struggled so much to get through a single volume. I'm generally open to works outside of my normal interests, but I find this tedious book so overburdened with period detail and misplaced epochal reverence that I don't think I can finish it. While the general subject may be somewhat interesting, the story becomes obscured by the obsessive adoration the author has for the phenomenon of geisha. I'm afraid I'll have to learn the ending from my book club mates, unless, of course, they feel the same way I do and don't finish it."
3,Revelations,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a poetic depiction of a young woman drowning in the vague abyss of poverty and tragedy, brutally forced to pierce through the murky and secluded world of being a geisha. In this groundbreaking book, we can peer into the life of Chiyo, a girl who survived adversities because of her stunning and beautiful features and acidic wit. A revelation of a forsaken Japanese culture and a quite remarkable read."
2,"Promises much, delivers much less","I came to this novel with, as I see now, expectations unrealistically heightened by its hype. It simply failed to live up to all the acclaim : while parts were fascinating, by and large the narrative tone struck me as flat and monotonous, and the plotline was far too thin to be stretched over 400-odd pages. I kept expecting a deeper immersion in the unusual rites and rituals of the geisha life, but in the final analysis the immersion was only shin-deep (and I'm only 5'10!) I simply wasn't captivated, and I finished the book with a sad, but solid, lack of enthusiasm, hoping for richness that never came."
2,A Western- and Phallocentric Japanese Woman's Voice?,"I wonder why a white male author invented an Asian female voice to tell a eurocentric and phallocentric story ... S/he tells us that no rape occured following the war, as a matter of fact, American soldiers handed out candy to the children of Japan. S/he tells us that the dream of a little girl from a fishing village is to catch the right (read: wealthy) ""eel."" S/he tells us that marble floors in train stations signify cultural/national greatness. Unfortunately too many people are reading him and listening to her."
4,A novel teaches Japanese a life of geisha,"I've never seen real geisha, like other almost all Japanese. Geisha is strange to contemporary Japanese just like westerners. So I'm not sure I have different impression. But the atmosphere of this novel is not peculiar to me(Some American-made stories or movies laid in Japan amaze us). Of course this is pre-war story, the time before I was born. I know selling girls due to help their family was not uncommon (though not so much) in those days. The heroine is about my parents' age( I am mid-40s). Japan's society has extremely changed after the war --- richer, Americanized, less exotic to foreigners. If you are interested in ""exotic Japan"", I recommend you to read this novel rather than coming to Japan. Anyway it taught me actual(or a sample of) geisha's life, which average Japanese know little."
3,False advertising,"I think that ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is highly overrated. If you want to write a novel, write a novel, but don't try to pass it off as a memoir. Suggesting that this is actually a memoir is a disservice to the reading audience. I was particularly irritated that Golden inclued a ""translator's note."" That just pushes the memoir idea too far! To suggest that the book is a memoir is to suggest that the reader is given unrestricted access to the perspective and insights of a Geisha. However, because this is a novel, the reader hears only Golden's voice! I think that the publisher and author have both tried to cash in on the popularity of memoirs to promote this book. To do so diminishes the importance of true memoirs that are on the market."
3,"Gripping tale, but unpolished writing","I admit I was caught in the web spun by the author and was very curious to know how the story of Sayuri turned out. But I didn't like the writing style at all. It was too mature for a young girl (in the beginning) and too pedantic later on. Also the fact that she remembered every exquisite kimono she saw, (in detail) since she was 9 years old is quite incredible.I also did not like the very heavy use of metaphors which seem to try too hard to be Japanese. I do not appreciate so much help in thinking and making my own connections.Despite these shortcomings, the story itself is very gripping because it opens the fascinating inside world of geishas. The very existence of geishas however, is a deplorable statement about the way women are viewed and treated in Japan, but that is besides the point.Overall, it is a good book and worth reading."
3,Learned something about geisha but story line amateurish.,"I couldn't wait to receive this book but after reading fifty pages or so found I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the geisha culture than was presented. I tried to get involved with Sayuri and the other characters but they were too shallowly portrayed to generate much interest. I'm not a fan of romance novels and felt this was more in that category than general literature. All in all, even though I finished the book, I kept feeling it could have been so much better. Perhaps it would have been a more effective novel if the format had been other than that of ""as told to."""
5,THE MOST VISUAL AND LYRICAL NOVEL ..ASTONISHING,I didn't expext to be drawn into a man;s story of a geisha. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE!
3,But the Emperor has nothing on!,"Well, I'd like to thank the author for doing all of the historical research that I would have had to do if I wanted to learn about the lifestyle of a geisha. I learned quite a bit.But when I got past the history, there was nothing else there. I could never emotionally engage with the characters. I didn't really care what happened to them (and only stuck with the book because I was curious about Japan during World War II)."
3,It just didn't hold my interest.,"I wish I could have liked this book as much as others here. It just never drew me into the story, although I felt the prose was rhythmic and the viewpoint decidedly female.Maybe I'm just not interested enough in Asian culture to savor the long story.However, the book is certainly impressive for a first effort, no matter the subject."
4,"A wonderful, cultural escape!",A truly enjoyable story. I delighted in the cultural history and geisha tradition presented in this book. Fascinating experiences throughout. I was sorry to reach the conclusion.
3,"Began loving it, but it turned into a romance novel!","I thought the book was well written, informative and interesting. But then it changed tone at the end and turned into an unbelievable romance novel! It didn't flow. Could it have been edited to appeal to the masses?"
3,Great story with shallow characters,"The book certainly weaves a rich and captivating tapestry of Geishas' lives. The book should have been more adequately named as ""Everyday life of a Geisha"". I certainly learned a lot about the geishas' job descriptions and their roles and responsibilities. However, I finished the book without learning more than just the names of the characters in the novel. The ending is especially trite. You are not going to find out why the Sajuri's chairman is smitten by Sajuri, because the author is more interested in detailing the Geisha rituals than in writing a memoir."
4,would like to hear and know more about authors credentials,Found it to be a riveting piece but would like to have more of knowledge of the credibility and understanding of the the author before I rave. How real is it/he? Did he earn this intimacy?
3,A tour de force without payoff,"A richly detailed, well written, but ultimately pointless ""memoir."" The intricacies of a geisha's life are interesting and give this novel whatever uniqueness it has, but there is little plot to speak of. In the final analysis, it seems not much more than an exotic Harlequin romance."
5,"Mu husband even enjoyed the book, and he never reads!","I felt transported to a different life that could never be imagined. It was magical and tragic! To be treated so royally and so poorly all at the same time is amazing. I found this a book hard to put down, always wanting to know what would happen next. I read it in a few days. It was pure entertainment!"
5,"I loved the book, but am puzzled by the ""translator's"" note.","This is a beautifully written and highly imaginative novel. But is it a translation, as averred by ""Professor Jakob Haarhuis, Arnold Rusoff Professor of Japanese History, New York University""? Or is the so-called translator a fiction also? Can someone please answer my question? Thank you."
4,Excellent--with one or two flaws,"When I saw the title I had some misgivings about this book which were happily unfounded. The story was both absorbing and extremely convincing. The only problem I had with the book was the endless similies the heroine utters. They were a little annoying. But this minor quip aside, reading ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" was a wonderful experience."
2,Character development too thin to create important work,"The world described in Geisha is fascinating, largely because so little is generally known about it. However, what we are left with at the end is a fairly superficial look at it and the people in it. The character development that could have made it a lasting work of writing, is so thin as to render it little more than an extended ""TV show"" experience."
2,entertaining plot; lame prose,"If you're looking for a fluffy romance novel, this is a good book for you: there's even the added benefit of feeling you're getting educated in another culture. The plot moves quickly and the story is absorbing.If, however, you're looking for good literature, I have to say that Geisha falls very short. Mr. Golden's prose is awkward and cliched. His style is to pummel you with one cliched metaphor after another. In fact, if you consider yourself a connoisseur of good prose, you might have a hard time making it through the story.Overall, fun story, miserable read."
5,I couldn't put it down. I hated finishing it. I wanted more,I felt like I was there with Sayuri the whole time. I could feel her pain. What an amazing woman written about by a wonderful writer.
3,Ending was so disapppointing,"I have to agree with many reviewers that the ending of this book was a major disappointment. For about 90% of this amazing detail-rich read I was completely engrossed - but the end was a cop-out and all ""wrong"". I really believe the author rushed the ending and was thinking of movie rights. This is the biggest shame as without the major flaw of the ending this could have been a classic piece of literature. As it stands I felt cheated."
3,"Lots of interesting detail, but characters are flat","If you've ever wondered what life as a geisha is like, this book will give you the information. However, the characters are pretty one-dimensional."
5,The best book I've read in a long time,"'Memoirs of a Geisha' is a fascinating look into the Japanese Geisha culture during the years leading up to and immediately following World War II. The book follows the life of Sayuri from the time she is nine years old and enters the highly-competitive world of the Geisha. It kept me reading into the wee hours. I was a little disappointed in the Danielle Steele type ending, but other than that, it was a magnificent book."
5,enthralling,"I spent two days reading this book and an average of 3 hours sleeping during that time. I was enthralled and recommend it to everybody in need of a ""good book"""
5,I couldn't put it down!!!,I lived in Japan for two years in the early 70's and found the culture very interesting. I heard stories about geisha but really had no idea what all their role consisted of. The author brought these characters out so dramatically that i will never forget them.
3,"Good, but not great","Arthur Golden delivers a well researched readable first novel astounding in how well he captures the narative of a japanese woman.That said, the phenomon that is this novel is hard to understand. While the character is interesting, she is far less so than the environment she inhabits. What makes the book worth while is not the main character but the way Golden introduces us to a world that had vannished in fire and smoke, leaving little more than a shadow of its former self.For all of that praise, Golden too often makes the mistake of many first novelists by falling into tired cliche' and over used plot devices. It seems when ever he finds himself stuck, he falls back on a sort of Jackie Collins coincidence to keep the story moving. That is unfortunate, because it detracts greatly from what would have other wise been an extraordinary novel."
1,Waste of time,"I thought this book was trite, contrived, and poorly written. Even though I am not very acquainted with things Japanese, it smelled false and exploitative to me.I realize that it's difficult to ""novelize"" a cultural tradition--especially when it's targeted to readers outside of the native culture--but I think the author used every Western convention to make this book appeal, and therefore it suffers from a romance novel-type whitewash that, in the end, just doesn't ring true.Read this if you want some mind candy. It works on that level. As something that might provide insight on Geisha history, it's pretty fishy."
4,A look into a foriegn culture- that may not be so foreign.,"This book takes you to a time and place that is as far away as Asia itself.Yet somehow it is familiar.Human nature ties us all together and this is what makes you love the book. To the author I say only, Domo Arrigato."
5,A fascinating and sensitively-told story,"This story fascinated me, especially the portions concerned with the training and rituals of the geisha world. It's a very involved society, with intricate rules for etiquette. The conflict between Sayuri and her rival keeps the reader immersed in the story."
4,Highly recommended,"Simply put, I loved Memoirs. It was a beutifully told story that delves into the mysterious world of Japan's geisha culture. Once I got past the very beginning (which is a bit slow) I couldn't put the book down. I must admit that until I saw a trailor for the upcoming movie version, I had no interest in reading the book, though I had heard about it before. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed by it.Some might say that the story was a bit shallow, that it lacked any thing really powerful, but I must disagree. No, it wasn't the kind of book that leaves the reader with a whole new perspective on life but the story of Sayuri's life will leave you feeling both intrigued and slightly melancholy.I'd recommend Memoirs of a Geisha to anyone, it was an enjoyable quick-read that I think anyone could like."
4,What would you expect?,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" was truly enjoyable. I believe that if you read the novel, with no expectations but to learn a little bit about another culture/society and its rituals, you will enjoy it. I knew nothing about Geishas and found that learning about the actual practice/art form, or purpose of the Geisha, was interesting. We see the main character from the time that she is sold, to loosing her virginity. This novel weaves a wonderful tale over several years of her life, until the end where she is symbolically and literally standing on a street in New York. Therefore, the ultimate question after reading the review of her life is ""Was she a victim or survivor""? And I think that in itself was enough to make this novel worth reading."
3,interesting glimpse into another culture...very dissapointing ending,"I think this book is overrated. Too much of the plot relies on unconvincing coincidence or chance. The narrator even starts many thoughts by declaring she doesn't know why something happened or warning that a particular event may seem unbelievable. If this occured only once or twice I could deal with it, but it occurs repeatedly... and beings to become quite annoying as the ending of the story approaches. I was even more annoyed as I read the last few pages of the book. I definitely agree with another reviewer that the ending was too ""Hollywood"" (the upcoming movie will probably be good though). Although I found the ending dissapointing I do believe this is generally an enjoyable read, particurlarly if you enjoy reading about other cultures."
3,"Enjoyable, smooth but unchallenging read","It flows and entertains with careful attention to period details. But it feels a bit like a good Hollywood production: think of Anna and the King or Titanic. Polished, enjoyable. Not an insult to your intelligence due to perfect form, yet it doesn't challenge it either and leaves a satisfying aftertaste. A good summer read. But if you want to be transported to another culture AND be challenged emotionally read The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy instead."
3,Too American,"I am Japanese and I do not like Memories of Geisha much. Golden portrays our culture well, but this story really is a fairy tale and I hate its ending. He knows (studied)about Japan, but he does not really know how Japanese people really are. Considering the fact that this, after all, is an American novel, it perhaps does not matter how Japanese people think of this story. Yet, I do not accept his story, and I don't want Americans to consider it to be the truth about Geisha. My grandmother and her mother were geisha and I know the fact more than Golden does.As a fairy tale, this story is well done."
4,"Plenty of Geisha, Not Much About the Woman","The good: Fast reading, solid writing, impeccable rendering of geisha life. Pace is fast, plot never lets up. Characterization of Sayuri, the protagonist, is well defined; what stands out the most are her numerous metaphors, scattered all over the book. I never tired of these metaphors, which were equal counts moving, funny, and beautiful.The bad: Even though Sayuri was aptly realized, I did not learn anything about who she was as a woman. I learned everything there was to know about geisha life, but who was Sayuri, really? I guess I wanted something beyond the lovelorn girl, something more real, something that made her *really* seem human.The ugly: Nothing ugly here. Golden's faux-autobiographical novel, complete with a fake introduction, is a complete account of geisha life told through an entertaining and eye-opening story. Highly recommended."
2,Highly overrated,"I slogged through to the end of this book because I found it historically interesting, though I myself couldn't speak for its accuracy. I found the language stilted, much like a great deal of the technical and scientific documents I have edited. Worst of all, though, the characters seemed as flat as paper dolls. Since Stephen Spielberg has bought the movie rights, I must imagine that he will do a better job bringing some humanity to the people in this book."
5,Take a wonderful journey and read it! Great Escape!,Memoirs of a Geisha was one of the best books of fiction that I have read. Golden takes you back in time and transports you to another culture. The main character Chiyo/Sayuri will capture your heart. She will bring you along her journey into the secret world of the Geisha. You will experience her many tragedys and her fleeting moments of happiness. Golden has created characters you will love and hate. I thought this book was a great love story. Golden has put the sterotypes of a Geisha to rest in this novel.I could not put this book down. I spent all my free time reading it and thinking about the characters and what would happen next. If you need an esacpe read this book and be transported in time and experience the secret world of the Geisha.
3,Overrated,"I bought this book because of all the press it's received and having just finished it, I am disappointed. The book is simplistic and at times reads like a romance novel or fairy tale."
5,Stunning!!,This novel is unlike anything I have read before. It is unbelievable that this was written by a MAN from the US. I felt as though I had been immersed in this world. When I put the book down (which was hard to do) I felt that my perceptions had changed - the colors in the world seemed somehow brighter. Somehow the author turned the written word into a visual experience. It was an incredible novel that I would recommend to anyone.
5,A beautiful Japanese experience,I have always been intrigued by the Japanese and particularly the Geisha. This is a senstively written book steeped in history and the life of a Geisha. You won't be disappointed.
2,Disappointing,"This book reminded me of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Yes, an original idea and some interesting language, but if you take away the dressing, you have a very stereotypical book. Stereotypical of what? Of both Cinderella, and of your typical romance novel."
3,"Well-written, imaginative but not substantive","This book engrossed me while I was reading it. I was amazed (as everyone was) that an American male could write so convincingly in a Japanese woman's voice. However beautifully written it was, it didn't make a lasting, memorable impression with me the way truly great literature does. There were some real flaws with it that I couldn't overlook. For example, the characterization of Sayuri's nemesis was so one-dimensional she was not believable.In my opinion, the best book to transport you to a time long ago in Japan is The Tale of Genji. Some nights while reading it, I forgot I was in 20th century America."
3,Beautiful language conceals an ugly story,"Arthur Golden's wonderful command of the language dresses up the male fantasy called ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" The prostitute who falls in love with her customer is a myth which is probably very appealing to some men, but offensive to feminists."
3,Enjoyable but slightly disappointing.,"This book is an easy read and parts of it are informative and evocative. I felt the characters lacked some substance which was a great shame as the first half of the novel worked hard at creating the place, atmosphere and personality of the plot. The obvious conclusion was rushed and I finished the book not really caring what had happened to any of the characters."
5,This work of art touched me in all my secret woman's places.,"This author has taken me to places and times beyond my imagination. At times I feel that I am the heroine, so well does he describe the feelings, hopes and dreams of the young Chiyo. It amazes me that a male was able to write this novel, I was sure that a novel like this could only be written by a female. I highly recommend this book and look foward to others to come by this author."
3,"You want to take this book in, in 1 sitting.","This book is like drinking a cup of tea. You want to take it in , in one sitting."
2,Geishas Just Want to Have Fun,"Although this book begins with a fascinating portrait of a young geisha-in-training, it ultimately disappoints. Why, after all she survives, does this woman long only to dress up, get men drunk, and make them laugh? Although she is said to excel at music and dance, she gives no impression of devotion to these ""arts."" She doesn't appear to learn anything during her wartime exile from the geisha world or from her associations with powerful men. She never gains any perspective on the strange profession into which she was sold as a child. At the end of this book, I felt I had spent my time reading a romance novel."
2,"Like two books in one - one exquisite, one conventional","The first two-thirds of the book is mesmerizing. But the end of the book is so romance-novel conventional (and creepy - pedophilia is not romantic in any context), that I felt terribly used, as though I had been duped into reading a Harlequin romance disguising itself as literature. The ending also felt rushed, like the author realized his deadline was looming and had to finish the novel right away. There's no doubt that this book is very well researched, but that research might have been put to better use with a non-fiction account of geisha life."
4,Rich in vivid detail,"This book provides a fascinating look at the enigmatic lives of the geisha during their peak of popularity, beauty and grace. The author has done an excellent job of detailing the rituals and practices of the geisha, as well as the world in which they were forced to compete.The characters are engaging and true to life. Sayuri, the main character, is a mostly believable heroine. Her ambitions were not always rational but this creates a more imperfect and human character.My main criticism of this book is the decline of story tension after the World War II section. And Sayuri does not attain her goal herself; how it is obtained is silly and flat.Nevertheless, this book is still an excellent choice for anyone interested in this almost forgotten Japanese culture."
5,"A magical experience you can see, feel and almost touch","You will become part of the scenery in this vivid book. You will feel like you are there as a guest in a teahouse. You become Sayuri's mind as she talks to you and as you feel life through her. A love story, a survivor's story and a magic carpet ride all in one."
3,Something different but quite a drag,"The plot is refereshing. However, besides the scheming Geishas who all want to reach the top, there is not much more in the story. After reading near 2/3 of the book, it becomes a kind of drag and you'd wish it would end quickly. A good book to skim through. Definitely not one of my favourites."
3,"A rather enjoyable, 'easy' read, but ultimately unsatisfying","A resounding, unanimous...3 Stars. A rather enjoyable, easy read that imparted a wealth of interesting cultural information. One learns the details and history of a Japanese sub-culture that shed some light, to the Western eye, on the Japanese mind. But does it really? Golden effortlessly takes the reader to Kyoto and we willingly go along. It's like a free vacation (of the virtual variety) that passes the time pleasantly enough but in the end is unsatisfying, forgettable and leaves us curiously ...unfulfilled. Did we see all the ""must see"" spots, and missed the ""real"" Japan? This is a book that we begin to resent, having asked too much of it. Things like, why this book? Why now? The deficiencies in plot and character development (and their disappearance), the `Romance' ending, lead us to ask: Why did we come here in the first place? Thanks for the tour but - time to get back to the ""real"" world."
5,SO GOOD I THOUGHT IT WAS NON-FICTION,I WAS TRULLY ABSORBED FOR FOUR DAYS WHILE READING THIS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN NOVEL.
2,"nicely researched, but dreadfully dull","Mr. Golden's meticulous research is commendable, but the story just didn't hold my interest. Guess I won't be reading any more NYT bestsellers as they seem to be over-rated. Back to the classics."
5,FASCINATING--ROMANTIC--BEAUTIFUL,"More than a fascinating novel about the life of a geisha. This is also a page turning book about the life and times of a young, orphaned girl during pre-and post World War II Japan. I couldn't put it down."
2,Discouraging,"As a Japanese woman in US, I have been asked about geisha forso many times. Everytime I try to explain geisha is not prostitute. Ihave read this book, and now heard that this will be a big motion picture by Spielberg, I feel so powerless. How could I convince people if what Sayuri and other geisha do in this story is just like those of prostitute? Yes, they went to school and learned many arts, but that just make these geisha looks like the prostitute with art degree. The author failed to show readers how these skilles and knowledge were utilized in their life. The author did a nice try to tackle with this sensitive subject, but PLEASE, fellow readers, read more books about Japan, look for other infomation in any means. Try some Japanese literature by Japanese author. This book is a real fiction, and you can't possibly see a true picture from only one fictional story.And this is not well-written even as a fiction."
4,Still a good read...,"I read this book when I was on a plane to Japan in 1998 (it's a long flight!) There has been a lot of controversy over it, mainly due to the fact that the source of most of Golden's information came back later and said he'd fictionalized too much of it. It is a very good read, and quite interesting, and I think we have to give him some literary license for this work. While many people push the notion that geisha were/are not prostitutes, could it not be perceivable that such actions did in fact take place from time to time? Try to focus more on the hardships that she faced, the nastiness and cattiness of the other geisha and her life at the end of the book. I'm sure the movie adaptation of the book due out shortly will start all the controversy once again! Don't read this book and take it as gospel for the history of Japan and it's geisha, but do read it nevertheless!"
1,I had to move on...,"I'm a rare voice of disappointment: Geisha intrigued me early on - I'm fascinated by Japanese culture. But I became bored with it's stiff documentary feel - it felt as if it was compiled from a wealth of information, but without a heart. The characters did not come alive, the scenes did not shine for me. Many times I retried reading it and at last gave up."
4,absolutely lovely,"I often only read fantasy, but this book transported me to such another land that I could have swore I was still reading fantasy and not historical fiction! I loved the way the author vividly described Gion, Kyoto, the okiya and especially the kimono. It was a beautiful, but sad, world. The character of Chiyo/Sayuri was wonderfully developed. Definitely read it! A great look into a completely different world! I now really want to go to Japan ;)"
4,Memoirs of a Geisha Review,"I thought this was an excellent book. Although it is about the life a prostitute, I found that it was tastefully written. There were no passages graphic enough to offend me. I found it to be an interesting book, with a lot of insight to the Japanese people and their culture and customs.I recommend this book to all who have an interest in learning about a lifestyle different from their own."
4,Great book,An amazing story that shows how life is full of great surprises. We just need to set a goal and take the steps and risks to reaching that goal.
4,Loved it,"""Never thought the story of a Geisha's life would be so engrossing, but I couldn't put it down."
5,Wonderful!,I don't think i need to say much more after over a thousand reviews. It's so gorgeous and delicately written that i was sure that it couldn't be fictional.
2,"BORING, BORING, BORING....","I read this book for the sex and was disappointed. There was none. The story was o.k., but the details put me to sleep."
1,"""exotic, mysterious, erotic Oriental""[junk].","If you want a good example of the depravity of the current ""Oriental"" (Orientals are rugs, not people as R. Lee has said) craze, this is the book. A good example of how things Japanese (and other Asian cultures too) are romanticized and fetishized. I dare you to go to Japan and ask (or even ask some Japanese Americans) whether this picture is relevant in any way to their lives. Don't mistake this book for reality in any way. Don't believe that this gives you a true picture of Japanese culture. This is literally a white man's fiction, no matter how beautifully written. Just keep this in mind even if you do read the book."
2,"Quite simply, overrated","I tried to read this book for my book club, but gave up about midway through. I wish I could see in this book what most others seem to see. Something was missing. To me, it was only too evident that it was a male author trying to write from the perspective of a woman--clearly fascinated by all the little trappings of femininity, but somehow missing the heart and soul of a woman. (And for the record, there are some men who write successfully from other points of view--that's not the issue.) He also clung to the historical details at the expense of creating a memorable protagonist.I thought I was just being my usual curmudgeonly self, but my husband recently read this book and felt the same. So disappointing!"
2,"Yuch, what a waste of time.","The novel starts out as an enjoyable read, and it was very interesting--I couldn't put it down. Until I got about two-thirds of the way through, at which point it seemed to be penned by Danielle Steele. from the point when the war ended, and American troops went through Japan, smiling and giving out candy, the people realized the Americans weren't the bad people they were made out to be,(to paraphrase book). Ugh, I don't think people are so stupid that they can be won over by chocolate! From there, it turns into a Danielle Steele novel, pur formula, in which love conquers all and a penthouse in New York helps, too. It will make a great movie, I'm sure."
1,POOR CONDITION - sold as good.,"Cover was torn, writing inside book, dog-eared pages, cheap edition - book was NOT in good condition - too much $ for the value."
5,Highly Recommended!,"This novel brings you to a time in history that no one will ever see again. Japanese culture is so beautiful and Arthur S. Golden captures it very well. My eyes have been opened to a new world and I loved every minute of it, I couldn't put it down!"
5,A good read,I loved this book. From the first page it had me turning well into the night. I couldn't wait to pick it up and continue. A bitter sweet story that moves along and characters that are well developed. I highly recommend this book to anyone
3,Is this an accurate depiction of geisha life or not?,"I don't know anything about the life of a geisha, or Japan, but as a woman I found that Arthur Golden's voice rang hollow in his depition of a woman in the latter part of the book. The continued 'girlish' behaviour of a thirty year old woman, who had experienced more challenges in her life than most members of a book club put together made me doubt other aspects of the book as well. The narrative suddenly seemed rather flat and empty as Mr Golden appeared to tire of his task and wrapped up the book in a couple of chapters."
5,A very engrossing read!,"I had the same reaction reading this book as when I read Wally Lamb's ""She's Come Undone"" -- you mean a MAN wrote this?? Mr. Golden has shown incredible insight and sensitivity in writing about a lifestyle that on the surface seems all about socializing, but in reality can be grueling, extremely demanding, and cruel. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,a marvelous book,There are so many reviews that I will just say that this is a must read for anyone who is fascinated by the Japanese culture.
4,A great read from start to finish,"I was ignorant about geisha before I read this book, but a friend told me it was a great read, and I was not disappointed. Golden definitely did his research, leaving no area untouched in his description of the geisha, and Japanese, way of life in the 1930s, '40s, & '50s. The book reads like a movie, and I was not surprised when I read that Spielberg is directing this for release in 2001. Great characters, historic setting, subtle but powerful writing- anyone who likes well-written novels should check this out."
3,A GEISHA OF A BOOK,"This book was like a geisha; lots of superficial beauty, but nothing substantial underneath. The cultural details (how to wrap a kimono, when to flash the underside of your arm) were enough to keep me engrossed, but I still have no understanding of the role of a geisha. Excuse me for being cynical, but I don't understand why anyone would pay lots of money for a geisha's company if he couldn't sleep with her at the end of the encounter. It certainly wouldn't be for the scintillating conversation; not if the dialogue in this book is any indication."
3,"A pleasant read, but not quite as wonderful as expected","I recently bought this book as it was one my book club is reading. I liked it, don't mistake me, but I felt that it was in some ways like looking at the world of Sayuri through a dark glass, or a layer of thin silk. She goes through many travails, but despite lengthy descriptions of her life, I didn't feel pulled into it, quite. This may be due to the author being male, and trying to describe the life of a very female woman, I'm not sure. It was certainly full of much detail and description of the lives Geisha lead, but I didn't ever really feel drawn into a depth of emotion for the protagonist. It all seemed rather remote."
2,a mystery,"I think this story might have worked if it had been written in the third person. It takes a much better author than Golden to pull something like this off. In third person there would have been some opportunity (and real challenge) to draw the narrator in more detail, but as it is she comes off as papermache. There is never a deep emotion from her, everything happens on the surface. Of course a male author can write a female character well -- but not in this case. Golden took the convenient way out, and the result is stereotype that is (at worst) offensive and (at best) boring."
3,So much richer than the movie,"I read this after having watched the movie, and as always, the book was better. I hadn't realized that it was fiction, and it was presented in such a way that fidning this out at the end was almost jarring. I have read since that there are some inaccuracies, but some of that may be just from the fact that the floating world is so secretive. As another reviewer noted, the characters did seem to have more American, or at least Western points of view, which initially lead me to identify with them, but later made me realize that this sacrifices the realism I would have preferred. As this is from another culture in another time, it's very unlikely to find modern western thought. I'm still glad I read the book and continue to love the movie."
3,"It's a novel, stupid","Memoirs of a Geisha after all is a novel. I am not a big novel reader and prefer historical books. It's a nice read, but not really my cup of tea. Memoirs gives some insight into Giesha experience, but I would prefer a real historical look at the life and times."
5,book review for nook,"the book was very detailed about sayuri's life, even though im disappointed that half the people's names in there cannot be traced, neither the picture she had made of herself for the spring play. makes me wonder how much of the story was exaggerated by golden? but for a book with a good STORY as im starting to believe it is, it was great!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!!,I just finished this book and I am tempted to read it again right now!!!! I have not read a book this good in so long and feel any other book I read will be a let down. I felt so attached to the charecters and still think of Nobu-san and the Chairman and Sayuri multiple times a day!!! I would highly recommend this book!!!
5,Interesting and Inspiring,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a very interesting book and I have learned quite a bit from it, Every word is so real and is so very mystical you don't want to put it down. It is a very inspiring book and is one of my favourites!"
3,Does the job but....,"I live in the northern part of the mid-west and I need good long underwear. This pair of shorts is alright. The cut is not so pleasant. It feels like you have them on backwards and the front rides up higher than the waist which isn't comfortable. The lace and elastic don't seem to have been tested for comfort because they are the worst part. With them riding up and having tight/scratchy lace, they feel like they are trying to strangle you. I'm probably going to take them to be altered so they fit better. I can't believe I'd have a pair of long john's altered but it's cold here. For someone much older, this cut might be fine. I'd also prefer seeing them make a cut that could co-exist with the current waist lines in pants. It's obnoxious to have your long johns riding above your pants, I'm not into the grumpy old men look.So, they are warm, but not cozy."
2,Concerned,"Was this item a knockoff or a second? No sewen in tag or label, no fiber content label. The name cuddleduds was stamped on the inside at the back in black ink. The next 2 or 3 lines were smeared and not readable. They do not fit as comfortably as my other cuddle duds. The packaging was not labeled only a code number and the words wash in cold water."
3,a little snug,"Liked item, good price although it was much smaller than the same item purchased in a department store."
5,Great for keeping warm in winter when traditional long johns are too warm for indoor wear,I've ben looking for these for a long time! Especially in black and shorter than ankle length.I highly recommend this product.
3,backside,It is uncomfortable to have only half of my buttocks covered. This suit would be perfect if only it had full bottom coverage.
2,Read the sizing chart,"I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart. Not a happy camper."
3,Great suit... Not too happy with the style,"I liked the fact that the suit sets low on the hips, but I wasn't too happy with the front center seam. Also, I didn't like the lack of a contrast logo, though this is merely a personal preference. I have found that the TYR suit with slightly wider sides, no front center seam, and a contrast logo make for a much better looking suit."
5,Nice Suit,"I'm really not one to order swimsuits online. I prefer to look at and try on my suits first, as they are all sized differently in their various styles. This year, however, my swimsuits style of choice, the speedo, has been very hard to find. I've had this style of suit before, so I felt safe ordering it online. When I got the suit, I realized just how small the style of suit actually was. The cut is fine, the fabric just right, but this suit isn't for the squeamish or shy. The 1"" measurement is for the hip measurement, and it realy is only 1"" wide there. The suit has a full back, but due to the small cut of the suit in general, it seems smaller. The front is fully lined, and both front and back have seams down the middle. Really, only confident, fit guys should have this suit, as any physical flaws will be magnified by a suit of this type. If you have low body fat, good self-confidence, and want a good tan, go for it!"
2,Tote,This was much smaller than I anticipated. I was going to return it but the shipping to return it was $25 so I would only get about $10 back so I decided to keep it. Makes me think twice about ordering from Amazon again. They should provided return shipping for items that are not up to par. It was cheap and junky compared to others I could have purchased for less at Walmart.
1,"Terrible Quality, Uncomfortable fit","I joined our school's Shakespeare club last year and needed a costume to fit the time period. I chose this product because, in the picture, it appears to be a grayish navy color. When I pulled it out of the package on the day of its arrival it was an ugly bright blue. And i mean bright. it was also cheaply made of that horrible fake velvet and was incredibly itchy. As for the head piece, it was completely flat and i had to stuff it with tissues to get it to look the way i wanted. I could have made a better costume for less money."
2,Disappointing,I thought because it was a National Geographic documentary it would be interesting but I was given a hypothesis narrated as a story with not a lot of supporting evidence and some really bad graphics. Very disappointing.
4,A Revealing Look at the Underworld,"You'll get a bit of what you're expecting out of this documentary, and a little of what you're not - but in mostly a good way. One pleasant surprise was the inclusion of a related active excavation by Dr. Zahi Hawass (Egypt's Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs - see Chasing Mummies on History), who I have always found to be a solid and interesting source on the subject matter of anything ancient Egyptian. Other archaeological work is also discussed, so to detail the evolution of Egypt's concept of the afterlife.The biggest drawback of this documentary is that it's exceedingly short for the subject matter discussed within it, for much of what seemed to have been some of the more interesting aspects of the Pharaoh's journey through the underworld were mentioned only in passing, with, at best, a cute representative visual. Toward the end the sequences seemed particularly rushed.Overall, the documentary is enjoyable and informative. Recommended."
3,Egyptian Secrets of the Afterlife.,"This hazwai whatever his face/name guy is annoying he is always hogging the camera in almost Every if not every Ancient Egypt Matter.Despite this setback of such an annoying person it is very informative although it looks like a cheesy Tv-Movie.It sheds light on some of the Wacky ideas these Once-Great Ancient people held but interesting nonetheless.A lot of their ideas in some ways besides the Pagan ideas are close to Christianity and almost every other Religion concerning The Underworld but the buck stops at where someone who can actually escape because he was a great King,Then again these were their beliefs."
3,wouldn't be my first recommendation,"So, I struggle with using this. The radio feature is really NICE. I mean, that is why I wanted to try it. Sadly, the radio doesn't come in...hardly at all. There are VERY FEW stations that it will pick up and hold the signal. I set the alarm to a station that was clear, yet when I woke up it was almost PURE static. The volume is REALLY soft, so I had to pretty much try to turn it up full blast just to hear it ('cause I close it when I set it.) When it is set and open, the volume is fine, but it is SO finniky when it comes to setting the radio (finding station) and then adjusting the volume to the point where it will be loud enough.It is simple to use and decently compact (for having the radio feature) and it is very lightweight. Overall really sturdy, and buttons are sturdy and the adjustors for the volume and radio are set well within the alarm clock itself, and are protected some (to a certain extent) so that they don't just pop off."
1,"Speaker, Hence Alarm and Radio, Didn't Work","Well it's an okay paperweight. Other than that, it just didn't work. I set the clock, then the alarm, and then tried the radio. No sound. Perhaps no radio, but not even static? And when the alarm should have gone off, and the alarm icon disappeared, it had to be the speaker.I called the 800#, and I was going to be responsible for mailing it back. That would be $5.97 for a $15 item.It doesn't come with the batteries, and I'll guarantee that most people don't have AAA batteries around the house. I have only one other thing in the house that takes triple A batteries.*It now sits in my electronic recycling bin waiting for the October pickup.One chuckle: Although they recommend alkaline batteries, the instructions read ""Do not recharge rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are to be removed from the clock before being charged (if removable). Rechargeable batteries are to be recharged UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION (if removable)."""
2,Not made to last,I was disappointed in the quality of this clock. Timex has really gone downhill. Within 6 weeks the snooze stopped working. Radio reception is pretty poor. Not very well made.
1,alarm works incorrectly,"We woke up late two days in a row because of this alarm clock. In disbelief, the third day we woke up early and stared at the alarm clock as it breezed through the set alarm-time without making a sound, or registering that it had missed the alarm time.To add insult to injury, the clock misses alarms only when we set the alarm for intervals longer than an hour. A two-minute to one-hour alarm test works fine. When we set it for longer intervals, it won't ring. All indicators appear to be correct (bell sign if using the radio, z sign if using the buzzer, pm indicator where appropriate). It just doesn't ring.The radio works fine, the clock works fine, the night light works fine. But what's the point, if the alarm won't work? This item goes back to the store."
1,I'll just use my iPhone instead.,"Not wanting to drain my iPhone batteries when out of town and needing an alarm to wake me the next morning, I thought this travel alarm could be a handy alternative.Nope.Not sure what they were thinking when they designed this, but you can't use the radio and the alarm at the same time, which is the pits if you like to fall asleep listening to music. And worse, the alarm is not reliable. I've had several instances now where it doesn't go off at the appointed time. Yes, I checked to make sure I was setting AM instead of PM, but to no avail. It's not rocket science you know, and I have managed more complicated things (like raising teenage boys), yet this alludes me. I'm going to write it off as a manufacturing flaw, and not my inability to conquer a little box with an LED display.This is not Timex's finest hour. Pun intended."
1,no stars,Had to return this clock. Put in batteries and it worked for about 2 seconds and went off. I was surprised because I have never before had a problem with a Timex product. Must have just been a lemon.
2,Radio,Radio dial is too small to (a) use (b) read (c) setHave yet to pick up local station ... don't know if it is signal or I am not dialing the right frequency
5,A Great Little Alarm,"My wife loves this alarm she says because it allows her to wake up gently. The snooze is easy to hit, and the alarm tone isn't blaring. The radio works great, too."
3,Timex T315SX Travel Alarm failed after three months.,"This travel alarm was perfect for me. I need clear large numbers displaying the time visible at night with a press of a button. This alarm has a red led light that illuminates the display from the front giving equal brightness to the entire display. Many clocks light from the side leaving half the numbers illegible in the dark. The graduated alarm signal gets louder and more insistent every few seconds until you snooze it or turn it off. I love it. Although I do not use the radio portion of this alarm, it works well. The size is perfect for travel .However, after three months of use, it suddenly lost control of the numerical display, a seven segment per digit LCD. Now the bottom half of the display is scrambled so that the entire display looks like cuneiform characters. Both the time of day and the alarm time are messed up this way.Will I get another one? I will hope that the next one does better. Yes."
3,Not up to standard,Clock arrived on time and appears as advertised. However the snooze button does not work. Seems to be worth the money but we will see if anything else stops working.
4,Pretty Good!,"This is a nice little travel clock radio, with fairly decent reception & sound. The only drawback so far is that it does NOT have a sleep function, to allow you to fall asleep to the radio."
2,Alarm not loud enough and it does not last,The radio signal is bad quality in my location. The alarm volume is only one level and not loud enough to wake up a heavy sleeper. I had it for two years before the screen went blank.
2,Mine was defective out of the box.,"Volume control would only affect the radio, and not the buzzer. But unfortunately, both the buzzer and radio would play, even if the alarm was set to wake me to the radio. Returned this and went with the Aiwa FRAP77 battery alarm clock. No problems with the latter at all. Product would otherwise be fine for someone who would not mind this odd glitch."
2,Bad product,The radio never worked and the light only worked for 2 weeks. It is a very bad product. Do not buy.
2,"Beautiful print, terrible text","In terms of the print, the new edition of the Teach yourself Persian is a lot better than the old one, but the content is not. The grammatical points are not thoroughly presented, that is, not quite enough for a serious beginner to have an panoramic view of Persian grammar. Second, it offers too little information on colloquial Persian. Third, too few reading passages. It has audio CDs, which is good, but most Persian textbooks out there in the market have audios too. So if you want to teach yourself, I'd suggest to try out different books, among them, I recommend Thackston or John Mace as basic reference; tackling Lambton if you are interested in classical stuff,if you'd like to learn more about different varieties of Persian, Baizoyev's Beginner's Tajiki is a quite good book, if you just want learn some Persian phrases to travel or impress your Iranian friends... forget what I just said, get lonely planet Persian phrasebook."
4,Requiem VHS with Sarah Brightman,This is an excellent MASS for the dead. I would like to play it for ALL SOULS DAY on November 1st. Sarah Brightman is very young in this video (early 20's?). The insert in the product gives the whole Mass more meaning. Highly recommended.
4,good,this movie was great. about real life everyday troubles that add up and ones that we don't always notice.
2,Why Can't These Women Catch A Break?,"The quintessential chick-flick, ""Lovely and Amazing"" is a warm and insightful film about feelings, family, and strained relationships. All the men are insensitive and unable to detect the needs of the women in their lives. All the women are tortured by insecurities about their bodies, but know themselves as creative, devoted, and nurturing. Resting heavily on character development like only a novel can, the movie lacks any real plot. Instead, the audience is treated to an ever deepening intimacy with the open sores that are the lives of three sisters and their mother. Well acted."
2,Waist of celluloid...,"Lovely and Amazing should have been a brilliant film about a family of women dealing their inner neuroses while trying to maintain a sensible family dynamic. What came out was a droll, boring, and unwitty. Katherine Keener, whom I generally like was unwatchable as an unhappy housewife who is forced to get a job when she can't sell her tacky craftwork. Emily Mortimer plays a typical actress type with a low self image and no ability to say what she wants. Brenda Blethyn, typically a strong acctress, is weak as the mother of this motley crue. She is seeing the signs of old age and decides to have plastic surgery, there are complications and she almost dies. This even brings the family back together and all is right with the world again.. BLAH.. I left this movie felling empty and unfulfilled. I am actually sorry i wasted the money to rent it."
3,"Girls,Get a Life","I've noticed something a trend perhaps in Indie Cinema, it's all about the Upper Middle Class. Are the writers, directors, of these pictures of this group? After all, even an Indie production costs millions to produce. Your average middle classer has a hard time comprehending his rent, forget getting a picture funded.In Lovely and Amazing, the women seemed to live in a plush world of decorator pillows and jeans. Big houses or snazzy apartments are the norm, trendy villages to shop too. Emily the Actress, she's not waiting tables while she is in between lovers or parts. Nor is her older sister, ex-prom queen , Catherine in the work world after college and kids. Her hubby has his semi-glamorous office world and mistress, and plenty of time away from the family. The cars are smooth and leathery without pretention, the clubbiness and veranda angst is so Bloomingdale.In the end we suggest all these ladies get a life."
1,Misogynistic and boring,"There are no female characters in this movie that have a single good quality to them. Neurotic, insecure to the extreme, self-loathing, angry, manipulative and racist - just for starters. I don't know what all those other reviewers saw but this film was horrible!"
2,No Man's Land,"Lovely, but far from amazing, this film is more of a vignette briefly examining the lives of three sisters and their mom who is approaching a cosmetic surgery procedure. Perhaps ""Lovely and Amazing"" is best suited for the ladies, as no men make an impact of any measure. Great acting and lots of potential but the film really doesn't go anywhere. Also, the sound was weak, always a bad idea for a dialogue heavy (and dependent) film. Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"
4,Wonderful and Irritating,"""Lovely and Amazing,"" is a wonderful and irritating little film. To paraphrase Pogo, ""We have met the characters and they are us."" All the leads in this movie are self-absorbed to the point of audience exhaustion, but at the same time they are all, somehow, likable. They are us, because they are more than us. The filmmakers have held a mirror to nature, and though the image is distorted because it is larger than life, I'd be surprised if every viewer did not find some part of themselves in anyone of the characters. Many of the laughs are generated in moments of audience recognition. The style is naturalistic, and there were scenes in which I felt like a total voyeur. - uncomfortable but strangely attracted. The actors, without exception, inhabit their roles, and bring truth to their characterizations. A good summer movie with more on its mind than most. Recommended."
3,"POIGNANT & WELL MADE, BUT ULTIMATELY DEPRESSING..","The good things about the movie: it is very real, and captures the idiosynchrasies of the women remarkably well (a mother and her two daughters through a period of change.)The bad things about the movie: although the movie is well made, the narrative is more than a bit lacking dragging the pace beyond any trickle of entertainment (and I recognize this is subjective.)That it is so real is also the movie's weakness. One daughter stands naked before her new lover and begs a frank assessment, good and bad, of her body. Another takes a job at the one hour photo after failing to sell her home made wrapping paper. Mommie dear thinks maybe her liposuction doctor is flirting with her.All you are left with is the feeling of having looked through a neighbor's window. The lives of these women occupy the space between tragic and heroic, in sight of both but touching neither.Somewhat depressing to watch but if you like ""reality"" this is as real as it gets."
5,Insightful,"Lovely & Amazing surprised me at the sheer content of sociological examination. Nearly every scene exposes a glimpse at unspoken, or rather rarely-spoken, idiosyncracies in everyday interaction.For example, the adopted girl, Annie, shows white viewers that even at her young age she must confront such topics as: straightening her hair, being told her ""mother"" (older black woman who is a mentor) must wear a swimming cap in the pool while the white swimmers do not; being told she doesn't need sunscreen because her ""skin is already brown""; understanding why her adopted mother needs liposuction to look better (Annie must wonder if she needs to look better also).These are but a breach in the bundle of issues this movie examines. Each character raises a multitude of motifs that could serve as meaningful topics for lengthy essays. If I were a sociology professor, this movie would be required viewing in my classes."
3,One reason to watch it: Brenda Blethyn,"Brenda Blethyn is in this movie. She's one of my favorite actresses and has been since `Secrets and Lies'. Here she's, are you ready for it, quirky! And has two quirky adult daughters and adopted a third daughter who might out do them all in the quirky department. These people are sad but it's hard not to like them. I didn't understand the inclusion of pedophilia in such a comic movie. It barely works in serious movies as `Little Children' and `Notes on Scandal'. The light treatment of it bothered me. By the end there did seem to be some emotional growth for all the characters as they rushed off to get mom from the hospital where she'd undergone liposuction. Sheesh. It's not a bad movie but it's hard to understand why it was made. Even the title highlights some of the frothy dialog."
3,a series of well-acted vignettes,"While I didn't think this film cohered well, there were a number of interesting scenes featuring a gifted cast -- Brenda Blethyn, Catherine Keener, Dermot Mulroney, Emily Mortimer and Raven Goodwin. Blethyn plays the mother of Keener, Mortimer and Goodwin. Each one has ""issues"" -- poor body image, eating disorders, self-destructive behavior, etc. and the film's action takes place after Blethyn has had complications from a liposuction procedure.Subtitles are available in English or Spanish. Extras include a trailer and several short interviews with the director and stars Mortimer, Mulroney and Keener. There is no commentary track."
1,WARNING!!,"This is not the Steve Harris from Iron Maiden!!!!! I notice people have bought products to do with Iron Maiden have also bought this!! This is some sort of R'n'B act!! This is not metal!! This is not a solo project from Maiden!!!!If you really want some non-Maiden stuff with Maiden members, pick up any solo work by Bruce Dickinson, it features Janick Gers on guitar!! :)"
2,Long-awaited LP = Total disapointment,"R.A, what has happened? I've waited 10 years for this. I don't mind your endless waffle about how broke you are, and how much you wish you were dead, but whats happened to the beats? Where's the darkness gone? Where's the brilliance (some of the best hip-hop EVER) of Every Label Sucks, Smithaven Mall, Flip Side and Stanley Kubrick? Night Of The Bloody Apes LP? If you're reading this and haven't heard of the tracks I've listed, these are the tracks to find, otherwise steer clear of this half-hearted disapointment. (I didn't want to give this review dog, but you made me do it). Oh, and the guy above - I think you're refering to me - I am entitled to my opinion, and i've probably been listening to this stuff since you were in kindergarten. For you to give this 5 stars shows the scope of your musical depth."
1,A complete dissapointment,"His rappng is uninspired and his beats played out. Don't waste your money on this dribble...He sounds like a flunky of the Wu Tang.He talks hard, but he's about as hard as warm yogurt."
2,poor design,Mask was a gifr for my son. Pieces were missing that held the lower part of the mask to the face. It's on its way back to Amazon.
4,Ok,"This mask is pretty good over all but the lens is a little watery but I don't notice it that much ,,,, it docent fog up too much but sometimes it fogs up ........ I expected for it to b a little better but over all it is good..... It works"
1,Broken and missing parts,The visor had broken pins and was missing one too. But i guess i get what i paid for. but i piad $15 for a generic airsoft mask at dunhams sports goods and its left me a lot happier then this mask.
2,Bad mask,This mask is a very disapointing product. This mask is only good for airsoft. If you paintball with this please use caution. It comes apart fairly easy. I recomend o take of all of the mask part and just use the goggles for airsoft with a mesh mask. I hope this review is helpful.
2,not sturdy,This mask fell apart on the inside after only a few uses. The foam came off very easily as we slipped it on and off. Would not buy this one again.
3,Great price but...,This is a very basic mask. The material is very thin and not very sturdy. Would probably buy something with a little more protection next time.
2,Not worth it...,"Positive Points:-Comfortable-Protects your face entirely-CheapNegative Points:-Can Fog Up if you're lying on the ground-Makes it hard to use the ironsights on guns, due to conflict with the mouth protecting section of the mask. The only way to fix that is remove that part, which makes the mask partially impractical.-The Goggles act as a Lens, but the lens oddly distorts things at the center, almost giving it a weird wavy feel that is dizzying.-The Foam comes off easilyTo put it simply, it's not worth a buy in my opinion. Cheap, yes, but there are other better cheaper masks around, or if you're willing to make a slightly larger investment, it will pay off. I regret buying this."
1,poor quality,I do not recommend anyone purchase these masks. They did not even last a day before they started to fall apart.
1,Well Airsoft Goggle System Face Mask,"This mask is horr-i-ble. When we first opened the box, the glue for the foam that covers your nose and eyes oozed off during shipping (Cheap glue). The exterior of the mask is rubbery so it may/will look deformed when wearing it. Does not look stylish or cool at all. If you have no choice, it's ok. I suggest that you do NOT buy this gun if you can wait and save up money for a better mask.2/10"
1,dont wast your money,You might as well go and get some bbs insead of this. ITS TERRIBLE. Ok I put it on and it was really tricky but when I got the hang of it was fine. A few days later I was going to use it when I put it on the fome on the inside tor off.. There also is a blind spot ware the plastic curvs and scruse your eyes up and gess ware its at......... in the middle!!!!! Do not buy this
2,Watery Lens and Detaching Foam,This is an excellent example of you get what you paid for. I bought 4 masks each under $15. The lens is watery which means it is like looking through a wet windshield. Very uneven view. The foam around the goggles to pad the face detaches extremely easily. If you notice the picture for this product it looks a little askew. That is what it looks like exactly.Since we field tested the mask we won't be able to return it. We are trying to fix the foam issue but the lens is a wash.What we do like is the mask covers the ears and face well. It is also light and breathes.
3,Okay for the price...,"Was a good product, but the foam on the inside came off after 1 hour. Still fits, and only causes very minor discomfort. A good frst choice. Wish it stayed together though...."
1,BAD!!!!!!,It broke twenty minutes after we got it. If I were you do not waste your time with it. It is a piece of junk.
2,Very dissapointing mask,"First the foam inside the mask came loose and fall off without use, the google visibiliy is very bad, they distortionate waht you see , the mask as you see in the picture is like that soft plastic, that never will fit in place perfectly so yo will look like strange, but if you are looking just for fun and fe shoot this will protect you but there are better mask outhere for 2 more dollars."
2,not worth it,This mask fell apart with in the first 2 hours of using it. It is not worth the money. Go to Walmart and spend the extra 9 dollars and get a mask that will last. That's what we had to do.
5,"""Rain Dancer"" - Magical, Enchanting, Transcendent, Masterful","I'm new to flamenco music, but this is one of the most enthralling and gently moving collections of instrumental music I've ever heard by anybody. I've also heard ""Rubia"" by the artist, but this one I give a little bit higher ranking. This may be his masterpiece among masterpieces, though I haven't heard others beyond these. Perfect music to motor up or down The Pacific Coast Highway on, or anywhere you want to conjure up a spirit of romance, even in a divine way. Exotic, tasteful, graceful, warm, energizing and calming by turns. A musical love letter! Recommended without reservation. Crying to be heard!"
5,Explore the possibilities,"This book gives abstracts of companies that implemented workflow, imaging and electronic document management.The abstracts give insight as to how each company solved their respective business problems, the methodologies used and the outcomes compared to expectations.This is a good book for management. The industries, problems, solutions, scale, and vendors are all varied. Management can get a good feel for the context within which workflow, EDMS and imaging can be used. (That it is an easy, quick read also helps.)Worth the money. We bought 3 to disperse throughout our enterprise."
5,an ethereal celtic tale,"I discovered this beautiful book whilst on holday in Canada, and became entranced with the world of Celtic/Canadian literature.Jane Urquart's writing transported me into the depths of Irish-Canadian femininity with a powerful sense of tragedy, beauty and imagination. I could not put this book down, and when I finished it I felt as though I had travelled decades and miles beyond the 20th Century world of modern-day London.Her capacity to relate the magnificence of 2 of the most beautiful places on earth is truly impressive, as is her ability to weave together history and mythology.I would recommend this book to any other dreamer who can allow themselves to be transported into the other world."
2,Disappointing.,"The lyrical prose and language of Away is its best and worst feature. Urquhart's rich, magical prose, especially in the novel's opening with Mary and her lover from the sea, is wonderful. However, the language is not enough to sustain interest. Urquhart's prose dilapitates into a passive, lazy drawl (which DOES NOT convincingly pass for style) as the ""magical"" parts tests the reader's patience. Disappointing."
3,wonderfully written; hard to comprehend,"Away is a wonderfully written novel- Urquhart's skill and competence as a writer is unquestionable. but wouldn't call this particular novel one of her best. i must admit, it was a pleasure reading it, from a literary perspective, but the events and decisions made in this story are very peculiar and unlikely. in the novel, a young woman from Rothlin, a fictionary island in Ireland is 'posessed' with the spirit of a young sailor who dies in her arms after being washed ashore from his drowned ship. the events following are odd and created solely by the superstition of the narrow minded islanders, and the girl's own over-active imagination. overall, i thought that the novel was incomprehensible in some parts, and the characters were impossible to relate to."
3,not quite perfect,"after i finished Away i thought it had been worth the read-although it took me a month to finish. somewhere after the first quarter of the book i put it down-i was tired of the plot line, nothing seemed to be happening. eventually after eyeing it for about 3 weeks i picked it back up and started again. it was highly imaginative and not what you'd expect, yet sometimes hard to follow. it is worth the time if you stay with it...especially if you don't neglect it...i just wouldn't recommend it when you're tired."
3,Reincarnation for the Irish,"Interesting book for the most part, but it is hard for me to relate with the continuously poor and unexplainable decisions the members of this family make. It's sad to think that a family has no control over a ""family curse"" that continues through generations and a troublesome male who is reincarnated for successive women in the family.Excellent writing, though. I wish it had left me with a happier and more hopeful feeling inside."
4,Excellent tool,"I found this book to be a wonderful tool, once understood... and that may take some time!!"
4,Murder and mayhem by aggressive women,This was an interesting who done it which was solved by good detective work by inspector Wexford among a group of man haters.
2,Disappointing,"Unconvincing, improbable little fantasy posing as a mystery, with cardboard characters you never really care about. Reads as if the author was more interested in the construction of the novel than in its execution. My first Wexford-Mystery, and probably my last. Not as bleak as her other books, but nowhere near as convincing either."
5,Probing mystery with many surprises along the way,"Chief Inspector Wexford's neighbor Rodney Williams is reported missing by his wife and what he thinks will be a typical ""husband running out on wife"" case proves otherwise. As the search for the missing man resumes, Wexford soons finds that Williams was a man of many secrets. The man's penchant for young girls coincides with the popularity of a local feminists group called ARRIA which seems to include every young woman in town. Rendell does a masterful job here of layering new elements to the mystery with every concluding chapter and the outcome eventually turns out to be surprising yet sensible. Rendell is also an expert at molding three dimensional characters with only minimal details (what was the other reviewer reading? ). Overall, well written, literate and satisying."
4,Couldn't happen to a nicer guy,"A women's rights group populated by high school and college girls and led by a virulent feminist, with a stylized raven logo. The mysterious disappearance of a secretive businessman who's often out of town. Everyone in the neightborhood seems to know about both. It's up to Inspector Wexford to tease apart the disparate threads and solve more than one murder. There are other crimes, equally reprehensible, that contribute to the tangled mess. It's fairly easy to figure out who did it. How, when, and why are questions more to the point, with more obscure answers.Rendell is a literate author whose Wexford series never fails to please and intriguing. And her books are even better when the victim deserves his fate.Note: This book was written in 1986, a long ago time before cell phones and word processing. Though this does not affect the mystery itself, a typewriter is one of the major clues, a blast from the past!"
3,"Not her best, but still dratted good","This is the first of Rendell's ""Inspector Wexford"" novels I've read so far, and this one wasn't quite as impressive as most of her other endeavors, in some ways. What I did enjoy was the secret society of man haters, or perhaps the uber-feminist group would be a better way of putting it. I found all that psychology fascinating and very compelling. I also had no idea who on earth was perpetrating these murders, so it's not like I had figured it out and was all annoyingly smug. Maybe it was the lack of enough appropriately psychotic characters, or the lack of insight into them throughout the book, as is the case with most of Rendell's other efforts. Still, Rendell on a bad day beats most other contemporary authors on a good one, so I'm not really complaining. Too much."
1,"Boring, rambling, redundant, tedious & stilted!!!","Rendell is obsessed with long, overly descriptive details of dress/appearance, landscape,implied feelings, attitudes & manner. Quite probably, ...RAVENS is the most confusing & tediousbook I've ever read! It's really difficult to comprehend how & why Rendell is thought to be thebest writer of this genre after trying 'valiantly' to 'get into this book!!'"
1,Tiresome,"I picked up the audio version of this book hoping it would keep my interest for a cross country drive. Instead, I found myself irritated at the tedious pace and extraneous details. I didn't care for any of the characters, and by the time I realized it wasn't going to get any better...I was in too deep and had to finish out the 9+ hours to find out whodunnit. At least it kept me awake for the drive. Nevermore."
4,plate scraper,greatest pot scraper that i have ever use. but i suppose if i was a better cook i would not need one. but if you cook like me i recommend this one.
3,"Works, but not as well as others","I got a different scraper as a gift many years ago, and when it finally disappeared I was surprised how difficult it was to find a replacement. These new scrapers do function, and save a lot of work compared to just sponges & scrubbers, but they're disappointing compared to my old one."
1,about half the size describes,"This item was listed as 5.4"" by 5.6"" and arrived 2.75"" by 3"". Much too small for my intended use and since I used a $25 gift certificate to buy 7 sets I cannot return without losing the $25 certificate. Either a blatant exaggeration of the size or I was sent the wrong merchandise. In either case it is not right that I am penalized by an error that was no fault of mine. I will not buy from this company again."
5,Sturdy enough for effective scraping without damaging non-stick cookware,"I got a set of these a few years ago and use them regularly. They are very sturdy and the thick rounded end allows you to use a lot of pressure without hurting your hands. I have used them with teflon coated cookie sheets and skillets, and the shape allows me to get into corners without any problem. The scrapers have lasted me a few years now without getting any knicks in them and without scratching any of my cookware. I was surprised to see Amazon's suggestion to use one for scraping ice off the car, I do not think I would recommend them for that use. Their size is very handy for pots and pans, but VERY narrow for using on a car windshield, and you don't have the same type of leverage as an ice scraper made for that purpose."
4,Does the job well,"The best drive kit I have used (of 4 or 5). Seems better constructed than the other units. The best features is the cooling fan, which keeps the internal drive at a reasonable temperature. Most other units overheat the drive, especially when transferring large amounts of data.Fast, works well, does what it's supposed to do. The fan is quiet enough not to be annoying.The only negative is the ESATA limitation that it cannot be connected or disconnected when the computer is powered up. This is pretty unhandy, so I tend to use USB connection more than I had intended"
5,Nice,"I've been using this for a few days for my DVR expander with a 1 Tb WD drive. It works according to expectations. My previous fanless enclosure was getting too hot. The fan in this enclosure does the job and is very silent. The red LED is unobtrusive and indicates drive activity. Installation is very simple. Quality aluminum looks and feels great. Enclosed cables seem of higher quality than those provided with other, cheaper enclosures."
5,This is THE report!,"This is it! The most current, confidential, informative information about the world of paid speaking"
2,Bower Super Wide Angle Lens with Macro,i got this to avoid spending a lot of money on a lens - don't - spend the extra money and you will avoid the frustration of this lens! it took me a while to figure out how to get the two lens' to work on my Nikon - which takes superior pictures - lost images - lost time - don't do it!
4,Annie=Andy!,"Stage Fright On A Summer Night is about Jack and Annie, two kids and time travellers. They go to many exotic places. This time, Jack and Annie find themselves in Elizabethian England just in time for,""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" It's just their luck that two actors are missing! Jack fills in for his part easily. But since girls aren't allowed to act, Annie is transformed to Andy! They hop on the stage and act the parts of two fairys!All through the book ""Will"" guides them through the theatre until they see Queen Elizabeth! At the end of the book, they find that ""Will"" is in reality William Shakespeare!"
2,Nipple covers,I was looking for something to offer more modesty when wearing a swimsuit and thought these would help. They are OK but not quite what I was looking for because the folds in the edges show through the fabric.
1,One - eyed Jack !,"As great as this man is, this particular venture was a total waste full of filler except for the re-hashed original recording of ""Key To The World"" which even in this state sells the whole CD. Without this one cut it isn't worth a listen at all. The greatness was covered by commercialism. What a shame too !!"
5,This is the stuff,Anyone that loves good music get this. My husband sings Key to the world to me. And I love it. Check it out
1,Not waterproof,"I bought this pad thinking it would be waterproof since it is vinyl, not a chance! My daughter has timed her diaper changes such that she has had accidents after the diaper is off. To my surprise the pad leaked thru! What a disappointment, save your money on this one!"
5,"Easy to read, powerful, and amazingly insightful","'Getting America Right' is just as my headline puts it:It is very easy to read. I found myself saying, just one more page before bed...over and over again. It is very well written and the information can be easily readable by almost anyone. You don't need an advanced degree to decrypt the truth and knowledge inside this book.Powerful. This book will make you aware of the changes that need to made in our society if it is to continue to prosper.Amazingly Insightful. You will learn so much more than you think possible by reading this book. Just do it, you won't be disappointed.This book is everything that I love about the Heritage Foundation. Not only do the authors present the problems that our country is faced with...they present the solutions as well. That is the single quality that so many of our politicians today lack, the ability to think through a problem and propose an actual solution."
2,NOTHIN' BUT A CON,"Whether you view Cons as ""conservatives"" or as ""con artists"", this book offers the same tired platitudes for fixing their America - push more and more market risk onto the poor and give corporations greater privileges and more tax dollars.It's just not worth the time."
5,"Okay, so I'm not really a kid.","As a camper at Camp Widjwagan (a YMCA camp outside of Ely, Minnesota) who has used Joe Seliga's canoes many times, I have to say that this is an excellent source of information about canoe making. He was a skilled artist who made magnificent canoes, and I'm honored to say I have used one of his own. So, thank you, Joe Seliga."
5,A True Artist,If you have any thought of building a canoe and want to stand beside a true artist in the field you should get this book. The photography is superb and you can't beat experience and Joe has that. The book shows a price sheet from 1946 when a 18 footer cost $178.00 so that gives you an idea of how experienced. A Beautiful Beautiful book.
4,Soulful Kirtan,"New to Stringer's music, I am pleasantly surprised by these soulful chants. Initially the songs struck me as a bit too short(all of them are less than 10 minutes long) so I was inclined to give only a four star rating, but despite their brevity these chants are beautiful---especially the last four. I now wish I had given this recording a five star rating.Because the chants are so short, those new to kirtan may find this recording to be a gentle entry into kirtan.While I am enjoying all the chants, one stands out for me over and above the rest. It's the final chant, Shanti Om. This is perhaps the most hauntingly beautiful chant I've ever heard. The first time I heard this chant its depth and intensity drew me inward and expanded my awareness, if only for a short time."
4,Pretty Good!,"This was a pretty good read. I like the idea that both Clay and Catharine come from different social circles. The fact that Catharine was a strong willed, young woman was also great. I like female characters that are strong individuals and can survive without the need of a man although it is quite nice when they do come together in the end. Clay was a person with a good heart. He owned up to his responsibility from the beginning. What I didn't like was that Clay's parents pushed the issue of the marriage. I don't think it was their place to do so. They really didn't know each other at first. I think the parents were being selfish. Also, why didn't Catharine push the issue of her true father's identity. I know I would've if I were her. But, other than that the book was good."
4,much better the second time around,"I am the same person who wrote the critical review below (the one with only two stars). I picked this book up again this week for lack of anything better to read, and was very surprised. I enjoyed the book much more this time, and decided I was too hasty in my comments before. From now on I'll read a book twice before I review it. I really admired the character of Clay, he really owned up to his responsibilities throughout the book. I just wished he'd fallen in love with Catherine sooner. I think that's what disappointed me about this book before, was that she knew early on she loved him but he was only interested in her for one thing. Also, the first time I read it I got tired of reading about all of her problems, but this time I admired her for overcoming them in spite of the family life she had. I still don't think this is Ms. Spencer's best work, but it's definitely not as bad as the review I gave before."
4,Separate Beds holds interest,"This novel's plot is a page-turner, and keeps up with Ms. Spencer's consistent high standards. She takes an almost unbelievable ""what if"" situation and makes a strong workable romance. My only complaint would be that the pregnant heroine drinks alcohol while she is pregnant within the story. I hate to think that a young fan might think that this would be Ok for her too. I know that perhaps one drink is fine from a medical viewpoint, but the heroine drinks more than one time. The hero of this romance is realistic, even though he is incredibly wealthy. I'm sure that's not an easy character to create. Kudos to Lavyrle Spencer"
2,Badly written and seriously dated,"I realize this is a book written in the mid-1980s. However, one of the things I judge a romance by is how well and realistically I feel the male dialogue is written. Generally, female authors do just fine with women's dialogue, but can be hit or miss with the men. WHen is the last time you heard a 30 year old man use the term ""davenport""?? I was about the age of the hero in this book in 1985, and I swear that the only person I ever heard use that term was my grandma and she was born in 1900. I also got annoyed with the heroine--you love the guy, quit giving him such a hard time, especially when he's being really nice. For me, the book was way too long in the build up and way too short on the resolution."
2,disappointing,"This book is a constant arguement! I read the first hundred pages, and skimmed the rest of the book. I got so tired of the argueing between the two characters. My friend loved the book and said she has read it several times, but I was very bored with the bickering."
2,Horrible second half overshadows wonderful first half,"This book was on such a good track. The first half of it was heavenly - the perfectness of the angst both Catherine and Clay felt was well done, the hardness of her decision, her fear, her desire not to end up like her mother.After their first Christmas together... ugh. The books spirals downward. I understand these things have a set pattern, and I do love romances. They meet, the fall in love, neither can admit it to the other for fear of rejection, they reject each other, are miserable apart and reunite. I GET IT. The problem with this book? NO ONE is as STUPID as Catherine is when it comes to love. NO ONE would live with a man she's ""married"" to and not realize he's falling in love with her.I can't STAND stupid heroines and LaVeryle drags out the gawd-awful part of this book for almost half the size of the novel. Boring."
3,"Predictable, yet worthwhile","As my first Lavyrle Spencer book, I found Separate Beds a very worthwhile read despite its predictable storyline.Catherine and Clay are complete opposites; from personality to family background and social status. Finding themselves plunged into a marriage of convenience (or inconvenience due to an unexpected pregnancy), they try to make the best of their differences. Obvious troubles occur as well as some unexpected ones.This is a sweet story that I finished in only 3-days. Spencer's writing style is pretty simple to fly through, giving you enough detail and description to keep you interested without boring you with too much of it. Recommended for those who want a good story but a book they don't have to concentrate on too hard."
3,Just okay,"I saw SEPARATE BEDS mentioned in one of the romance threads and thought I would give it a try. Overall it was just an okay read for me. It wasn't horrible, but it's not a keeper for my bookshelf either. I gave it three stars because it was well written and I liked the plot. It was the characters and the last part of the book that kept this from being a four or five star read for me. They both had issues they were struggling with and that's okay. I like a little conflict and emotional turmoil in my reading as long as there's a resolution and happy ending.I hated the fact that Clay took up with his ex-girlfriend even living with her while he and Catherine were separated. Even though Clay and Catherine got back together in the end I just didn't feel it. It seemed like they had been living separate lives and hadn't worked to resolve their issues. They just drifted back together and it seems like to me they could just as easily drift apart again."
5,Favorite Summer Read!,The story of Clay and Catherine is my favorite summer read ever! I found an old copy when I was in high school and read it by the pool one summer day. I couldn't put it down! I've been reading this book once every summer for the last 13 years and won't stop any time soon. I haven't read many of Lavyrle Spencer's books but this one is definitely worth reading! A great love story!
5,Good story,"This was a really good story. It took awhile to like these characters, but it did come. I really enjoy this author."
3,Dated,"I was disappointed with this book. I have read other books by this author that I really enjoyed, but this one seemed to drag in places. Also, I didn't realize how old the book was until I purchased it...the book is very dated. It wasn't so bad that I stopped reading, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Pretty good,"Nice characters, situation and plot okay, though I found myself loosing respect for the male lead due to some of the author's choices for him. Enjoyed the author's prose and pacing."
4,"3-1/2 maybe? Fun, tounge-in-cheek alt-country","Known in the art world as ""The Flagman,"" Ab Ivens is a Georgia-based alty-tonker with a (pardon the expression...) colorful past... The colors are red, white & blue, and they're placed on a bunch of kooky art sculptures, many modelled after the American flag. He also has a nice way with a country tune, and while his singing may not be entirely enthralling, his songwriting is consistently intelligent and engaging. A few really good songs on here, including ""Drunk & Crazy"" and ""Too Early To Leave,"" as well as a nice cover of the old Leroy Van Dyke hit, ""Walk On By."" Not earthshaking, but nice. (For more about his visual art stuff, you can check out the band's website: www.xmissamericas.com.)"
5,An Old Friend,"I loved the complete first season for one primary reason: It took me back to Wednesday nights at 9:00 on ABC. The whole family would sit in front of the television to see this show. This is wonderful for Fall Guy fans. Sure, the scripts were not Emmy award winning, and the acting was not Emmy award winning, but people tuned in to see light-hearted entertainment and action. It had no message, but we didn't expect it to have one, we just enjoyed the ride. It was fun. We got to see Lee Majors, car chases, and older actors from the sixties and seventies that you didn't see anymore. They had a soundtrack of popular music of the eighties in many episodes. I just hope seasons 2, 3 and 4 come out soon."
4,Good show that doesn't take itself seriously,"Good show that doesn't take itself seriously. Had it's funny moments and the simply silly ones as well. Oh, yeah, and kids, don't try this at home!"
4,Enjoyable fun with one of the best theme songs ever,"It's been over 25 years since ""The Fall Guy"" first aired, but time has been very kind to this series about Hollywood stuntman, Colt Sievers (Lee Majors), who also works as a bounty hunter between jobs in order to pay the rent. I saw this show for the first time when I was a child and it was airing on television and I liked it then and rewatching it many years later on DVD, it still holds up pretty well. The show is a nice blend of comedy and action, with some truly amazing stunts. Given the fact that the stories were written in the 1980's, they're not too bad, and the three leads, Majors, Douglas Barr and Heather Thomas, are all likeable. And finally, this show has one of the best television theme songs ever. If you don't find yourself singing along by the final episode, I'd be surprised."
5,"""They don't write like that anymore!""","If you are someone who likes action, great stunts, and incredibly hot looking women (like me!) then I would highly recommend this DVD set. Not only was the price very reasonable, especially compared to other places (which it was priced way too high!) The episodes are top notch, and the quality is very good. They just don't make television shows like this these days, mainly because they would be too expensive to produce.In addition, the storylines were very well written, and there were many great guest stars. Lee Majors certainly played the part very well, and it is also great for the nostalgia factor. Shows like these take you back to a more simple time, an era where television had to be good!"
5,Colt Seavers!,"I've been wanting this set for quite a while and at this price, it was a no-brainer. I have fond memories of watching this as a kid and I was not disappointed when I sat down and burned through the first two DVDs in one night. Yes, it is cheesy, but it is a fun watch and getting to introduce my son to the Fall Guy is absolutely priceless for me.Now, if they would just get around and release the rest of the series, I would be a very happy man."
4,An etymological treasure,"My grandfather's favourite word was ""horsefeathers,"" so when I found this book on a library shelf in my junior high school in the 70's, I was shocked to discover that the original meaning of horsefeathers was not ""balderdash"" as I had assumed, but something quite different.An online argument about the etymology of the word led to my purchase of the book from amazon.com. I highly recommend it both as a source of interesting word origins and (as it was in my case), an argument-winner.It's a good buy. And I'm not full of horsefeathers when I say it."
2,not as fun as I thought,"Boring, small print. Difficult to read. Not a fan. I bought as a gift, but couldnt bring myself to give it!"
1,Snikt you!,"This movie is cliched, dull, full of one liners and unnecessary cameos; gambit, xavier, emma, cyclops, blob, and... will.i.am.? are you serious? WILL.I.AM?!?!?!?! Who the hell was responsible for this atrocity? The movie is rather disrespectful to the fans and an insult to my intelligence. Wolverine origins is the equivalent of jaws 4 in the way of how they decided to screw up a franchise in the name of greed. If I could, I'd give this movie 0 out of 5. Unacceptable."
3,Uninspired mediocrity,"This highly-anticipated addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise was pretty much a disappointment. Yes, sure it was watchable (mainly due to some decent special effects), but just barely. The story was so choppy and unfocused, it was very hard to stay interested or care. The mutants were boring and uninspired (was it really the best the comics universe could offer?) Probably the best part was the first 5 minutes where Wolverine's and Sabertooth's militant past was captured. After that, the movie felt like a patchwork of random events assembled to tie this movie to the rest of X-Men franchise. Unfortunately, even Hugh Jackman with his chiseled chest couldn't salvage this mess of a movie."
1,"Yes, hard to believe that Wolverine would be this bad...","I heard that this movie was terrible, but I couldn't believe it. ""Hey, it's Hugh Jackman, it's Wolverine, how bad could it be?"" Well, it was pretty bad. The best thing about it was the opening sequence and the credits, and it just went downhill from there. What was anybody's motive for doing anything at all? It just didn't make any sense. What's all this nonsense about having a battle on the narrow concrete ledge on the top of a nuclear power plant cooling tower? Why does Scott Summers need to show up? Horrible on all counts. They are already talking about a ""reboot"" of the ""series"" only a few years in. Awful."
2,The Code you entereed is not recognised as valid code,The Digital Copy code given does not work. I get invalid code error when I tried to do the Digital Transfer on both iTunes and Windows media player.
3,"Unnecessary, if watchable","The Bottom Line:After a cool opening credit sequence (that adds this film, along with other luminaries like America's Sweethearts, to the list of films that peak before 10 minutes have elapses) Wolverine devolves into a rather bland ""origin story"" that's made even more redundant by the fact that those of us who have seen the first three X-men movies know exactly where things are going; though Jackman and (especially) Schrieber give it their all, there's not a lot here to like.2.5/4"
4,Great!,"I liked it. I've never seen seen any of the comics or the other movies in the series, so there were no pre-conceived notions. Anyway, my husband is a big fan of the movies, so we watched it one cold rainy Saturday snuggled up in bed. I expected to fall asleep ten minutes into it, (as I usually do), but stayed awake through to the end. Since I fell asleep during: Octopussy, (at the drive-in), and The Empire Strikes Back (during its first run at the movie theater), and according to my hubby, more other films at home than he can count, you can figure that if a movie keeps my attention for the whole length, it's pretty good."
4,not to think too much on,"i love the comics. x mens always been my favorite series other than when i was little and i was all about superman. All the xmen movies are different than the comics. theyre comic inspired action movies BUT i love em. hugh jackman is so cool. Hes an awesome adaptation of wolverine. In this one i loved how they pulled in scott without really pulling him into it. I really like liev shreiber and was happy they picked him to play a young sabretooth. It was a fun movie. i watched it in two settings so im not giving it a full 5l Lets face it if it was the best thing ever i would have watched it all the way through. Like all the others, when you match up this to Xmen first class which timewise fall close things just dont add up but like i said not to think on much. Not my favorite but the last comic movie i saw was Green Lantern and haha anythings a step up from that."
2,"Not bad, but the weakest of the X-Men movies!","This was a cool movie with interesting concepts, but there were too many things about that kept it from being a great movie!What I liked about this movie:1. Hugh Jackman gave us an excellent performance as Wolverineonce again!2. Ryan Reynolds was great as Deadpool!3. The visual effects were great!4. Most of the under foot actors were great!5. Gambit was awesome!What I didn't like about the movie was:1. My biggest complaint is; what the heck did they do to Deadpoolat the end of the movie?!?!2. Most of the action sequences in the movie felt forced!3. They under used too many characters!4. The movie kept building-up and building-up, but the pay off inthe end was not satisfying!5. I am still confused if this is a reboot or a prequel to the firstthree movies...!6. Too many dull moments/ the pace was not good!Bottom line: While Hugh Jackman gives us a great performanceonce again, most of the other elements in this movie werenot good!My grade: C or two stars!"
4,"Not a great movie...and yet, a lot of fun!","In all honesty, this isnt a great movie. It isnt nearly as good as the original trilogy or First Class, but it is Hugh Jackman kicking the crap out of people and being really bad bass ;) all in all lots of fun."
2,blah,"The Wolverine story is excellent, but you can juxtapose this movie against X2 for a great example of poor vs. good execution of the same story (or at least there is lots of overlap)."
3,Not a bad price for a good movie,"I was going to buy this on Amazon, but happened into WMart the day it was released. They have it on blue ray with a free digital copy and I think it came with either a 2 or 3 disk for about the same price. The movie was good. I enjoyed getting the background on Wolverine. Even my wife enjoyed it and now I get a free copy for my IPOD."
1,Aweful!,Hands down the biggest let down of the summer. The plot holes in this movie are big enough to drive a truck through. Wolverine makes action driven movies like Transformers 2 look like Schindlers List.Save your money.
4,Great but too bad!!,A very nice move but the problem is that you cant her the audio on a ps3 Even with the last update (3.0.1 ) if the settings on bit stream ; it should be on ( pcm ) such a waste not to hear the ( dts HD )And for the move in some clips when a blue screen background it seems very obvious that the lighting and colors deifiers ( it could have been done better)But for the move it is one of the best
4,Better than X-men,"Not sure why some hate this movie so much. The movie and story is great. It breaks down the origin for people who are not comic book readers in a well-done way. If you were to get the entire origin on film, it would be a tv series not a movie. Action was great, Jackman was great, Sabretooth was great... The rest of the cast was good...One problem I have with it is hollywood taking and changing an existing character to create a new one? You will see. Not sure why they do this when there are so many characters to chose from already."
2,"Good actors, long on violence, short on plot","This was a rock-em, sock-em movie. When the plot got slow, they threw in another fight scene. I found the amount of violence disturbing. If it hadn't been based on comic book characters, I doubt the movie would have received a PG-13 rating. Not recommended for young or sensitive children."
1,Don't buy!,"I'm sure the movie is terrific but the blue ray would not play on my 3 month old player, the digital copy was unplayable on my state of the art mac, customer service was unavailable for both and I am extremely irritated. The only customer service option was by filling out an online form and waiting -- well waiting longer than I want when I had movie night planned at a time certain. I'm sure security is a concern but is it too much to ask that I be able to watch a movie I just purchased -- on new equipment -- without a multi-hour customer service component?"
4,X-Man Origins: Wolverine,A superb dvd for anyone who loves X-Man books. My whole family have watched it three times. It get bettrer with each watching.
4,tbolgeo,"Wolverine, X-Men Origins, was a very good movie that answered a lot of questions concerning Logan's start in life. While it was not a critical success, it was an enjoyable waste of time that is exactly what I got to the movies and buy DVD's. I enjoyed it and I hope that you will too."
1,Insulting...,"If there's one thing I hate, it's eye candy, something thrown up on the screen for its own sake and no deeper meaning to it at all. This is just such a film. This movie's plot is an insult to anyone over the age of 3 and the characters often act in ways that are completely contradictory to what was previously established. This is primarily true of Wolverine (sorry Hugh) but also of Gambit. I couldn't wait for this thing to end, much likeTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Single-Disc Edition), another attack on thinking people everywhere. Unless you're a hardcore fan of X-Men or Hugh Jackman, avoid this like the plague."
2,Male Testosterone,"I just watched the DVD of ""Wolverine"" and thought that men made it, for men, and without any heart and soul. It is full of special effects, no real character development, and few females ...only the weak subservient ones for the strong males. Hugh Jackman did this for the money. Anyone can be bought. It does not have the warmth and camaraderie of the previous three X-Men movies (this could be because of the absent of real, strong, female roles), and there is violence everywhere. We have become numb to seeing killings on screen."
3,Buyer Beware,"Look. I'll start off by saying I have no issues with the product. I think both the trilogy and x-men: orgins look great and play fine on my player. However I was disappointed, because, after buying this from amazon, I opened my X-men trilogy on blu-ray, only to find out it was previously opened/viewed. I saw orange stickers on x-men: the last stand, and upon looking at the discs, I noticed a few fingerprints on them. Now, the discs played fine, no issues, and the digital copies came out fine too. I Just think that if amazon is going to send you a used product, they should note it in the product description. When I buy a new product, I expect it to be new."
4,Non stop action!,"I'm a huge fan of the entire X-Men genre. This movie focuses on the necessary who, what where, when and why that should have been addressed in the original movie, but remained only hinted at concerning Wolverine's mysterious past. This movie (Finally!) brings in the other characters that all X-Men fans anxiously await with breathless eagerness--Gambit, Sabertooth, Silverfox are just to name a few. Non stop action, thrills and one hell of an action film!"
1,this movie is not ment for fans,"Jackman and Shriber awesome,Reynolds dead on, the rest of the cast garbage, scenery good, music good, and thats about it. I dont mind that they change somethings but the movies isn't well written at all mad no sence. For those that say ""at least its better then X3"" thats no excuse; the movie is weak dont waste your time your better off watch Wolverine and xmen"
2,Must...review this....bad...film...uhhh,"Thank god I am well again after watching Origins. I almost thought I had a lobotomy. Origins has no plot, subpar special effects and numerous gaping holes due to comic book characters having several thousand different story lines and experiences. Fights, fights and more fights are what we get here along with the usual ""oh, so that's how Wolvie knows Blob"" scenes. Gambit is here just because he's Gambit and fans have been screaming for him since the first X-Men film. Otherwise, he serves no necessary function. And the script is terrible, typical summer shlock, but what do you expect from comic book writers? If you really need to kill some time between jobs, pop this joint in and smoke it, but don't expect a memorable high."
1,Utter utter garbage,"I loved X-Men and X-Men 2, X-Men 3 was quality but lackluster / compressed. Wolverine Origins is complete garbage. Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, but this movie blows. Deadpool is Baraka / Cyclops? Adamantium bullet made Wolverine lose his memory? Almost no blood in the fighting scenes? Wolverine WILLINGLY went to Weapon X - to get back at Sabretooth no less?Just garabage, they should reboot X-Men simply because of this movie. Here's hoping X-Men First Class is well done."
4,Jackman is a young Clint Eastwood.,"Kayla used her powers to trick Logan into thinking she was dead. Nuff said. Except that this is one of the best action films ever made, up there with Desperado. Pure escapist entertainment. I love The Dark Knight, but that was a crime saga. This is fantasy action. And good fantasy action at that!"
3,Entertaining,"Nice fit for the others... Hue carried it well without his big cast, but it would have been nice to Halle Berry again..."
4,Great Action,A very believable story line to describe the origin of wolverine.I hope that they make more prequel movies to describe other Marvel Characters.
4,There is no miss with Hugh Jackman,"This movie was unjustly reviewed. I like it. I like the whole series and this is an integral part of the story. That it got thumbs down is good news for us fans because it is reflected in a cheaper price, and you gotta like that. Buy it. Watch it. It's entertaining from start to end."
4,I enjoyed it,"I have always enjoyed the X-Men cartoons and movies, however only occasionally read the comics. I had fun watching this movie and enjoyed the action, no it isn't going to win awards, but it provided enough entertainment that I will watch it again. As far as the transfer goes, the quality of the Blu-ray is great for both the video and audio quality. Additionally, I like these Blu-ray movies that come with the Digital Copy as it lets me take the movie with me when I travel to have my own entertainment instead of paying at a hotel or watching a movie I don't enjoy on a flight."
4,Okay...,"It is a pretty good movie, but not my favorite. Mostly a back story for a couple of the characters from the other movies."
3,At least it's not the comic book drunken hobbit....,"This movie steps back in time and retells the story of Wolverine, the people he knew back in the day, and the reason why he ended up an amnesiac. It has more potential than the film carries out. The movie version of Wolverine is the only version of the character that I can tolerate, but this one, which messes with previous movie continuity and works around with some of the material from the miniseries that revealed the character's hidden past, comes up a bit short, particularly in the depiction of Deadpool. There are some good elements- Taylor Kitch does a reasonably good Gambit, Brian Cox is replaced as a younger version by the always good Danny Huston, and Jackman continues to play the title character with a gruff likeability."
3,Not as bad as I thought!,"The movie had a decent story but was from no part of the comic lore. Cheesy in parts, exciting in others--it was a diverting piece of entertainment but the CGI showed a bit much"
5,X-Man Origins: Wolverine,I like the X-Man series of films and this one continues the entertainment. Hugh Jackman is great in the part and the movie looks incredible in blue-ray.KenWebmasterAbout Facts Net
4,It's pretty damn good...!,I think this is one of the best action films ever made. Up there with Desperado. Hugh Jackman is like a young Clint Eastwood. Hybrid do some of the soundtrack. The fight scenes are spectacular. Don't be a hater.
1,Predictably Disappointed,This movie sucks! Rated pg-13? C'mon! I tried to like it but it is just too lame. Hugh Jackman is a horrible wolverine. Two thumbs down. Marvel needs to get their act together.
1,Blu-ray zones,"I cannot watch the movies. I took for granted that being shipped to Europe, they would come prepared for the right zone. Tried to play it and then I realiced they came with zone A, for the States. Amazon will answer that I should have known, or checked, or it was my responsibility, or whatever, right? Next time I should go to a shop"
1,Blu-ray technical difficulties,"Second Blu-ray DVD that I've had technical problems with. Not sure if mass production quality control is up to standards. First problem was audio, this X-Men Origins is simply non-functional. It does not download or play."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK IT WONT LET ME PLAY IT OR REFUND IT,"I rented this and it won't let me play it. It also will not let me refund it. Apparently there are no human beings that work for amazon, but if there are, could one please contact me so i can get my refund"
2,Extremely Cheesy Hero Film,"Maybe it's what i get for going back in time to get a action film but it wasn't like it came out THAT long ago, but the special effects seemed a little hokie and the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense. Also, it was rated PG-13, but the language and violence warranted an R rating in my opinion. Not really worth your time and definitely not worth your money."
5,X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Single-Disc Edition),"One of the my personal favorites. This one really gives a satisfying story about not just the origins of wolverine, but of all the X-MEN & more!! XD"
3,Wolverine,"The story was a little confusing to me because it was never really revealed why Sabre Tooth wanted to kill Wolverine. Was is because Wolverine didn't want to be a killer like him?I was kind of disappointed they didn't use the original Sabre Tooth actor, but the new one did an awesome job.Like most Wolverine fans, I like watching the blades come out of his hands. But I think they actually over-did it this time with all the close-up shots."
4,;0),I love this movie wasn't sure at first but not bad watchable and I love the action. With that out of the way ladies how hot and sexy was Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds. There was a time Ryan was skinny but now wow.... But great action was always a fan off the xmen comics cartoon and now movies.
2,Enjoy your One Viewing.,"The first act and opening credits of Wolverine are very strong, except for an uncomfortable, almost comical bit where a little boy runs around with claws. The Logan character, as played by Hugh Jackman is very well realized and easy to like - but the overblown plot around him is not going to make this movie watchable for generations. Hats off to Hugh Jackman for the performance - I paid to see the movie just his artistry more or less.Just eat your popcorn and enjoy the ride since it's not one you're likely to revisit.SPOILER: The Uncanny Valley is breached in the final scene when Professor Xavier (represented by the lost digital rights of Patrick Stewart) shows up looking like a broken Disney Animatronic. It's horrible. They should have cut that!"
5,Like it,I enjoy the X-men collection since I enjoyed the action scenes I would recommand this dvd to any and all comic book fans.
4,Am I rating the movie or the service?,I assume the movie. It was good: Hugh was hairy and clawy. Liev was toothy and clawy. And they fought.
3,Barely average,"Comics would have to be some of the easiest stories to translate into film. Many characters like Wolverine have a rich, incredibly complex history that can be drawn upon while the comics themselves present a visual storyboard. But, Wolverine the movie is utterly hamstrung by a poor story line, shallow development of the characters, and very poor CGI for such a major movie. I'm not a major Wolverine fanboy by any means, but from what I remember he is suppose to be a [...] killing machine. I think in the previous X-Men movies, and particularly in this movie, the edge is taken off of Wolverine to his detriment."
3,Marvel Studio has done it again!!!,"Well I don't have anything else to say, but to say the movie was owesome. except one thing, the end was not too much good than I expected. Just like AVP-R.The special effects, action sequences, plot is alright, But I expected to have more action in the movie.Anyway no harm. I enjoyed the movie at my appartment in my 5.1 JVC home theatre system.One thing Stan Lee is the man for comics. there is not other person for mavel comics like Wolverine.My recommendation for other all around the world. 'Watch the movie, you will enjoy it everyday"".Zurakim TaipCity of Kandy, Sri Lanka+094"
3,Another reason not to make a prequel,"The continuity and premise don't add up. Jackman's talents are wasted. This movie falls more in the ""straight to video"" nich."
4,a good bit better than film critics led me to believe,"i really enjoyed this picture . thank god for NETFLIX . i seldom pay to see a film theatrically anymore (perhaps twice a year) . a co-worker told me she really enjoyed it and recommended it . i don't watch television (as i refuse to pay for it and hate the adds and so on) . perhaps seeing less makes you appreciate stories you do see more ? dunno , but i thought it was a lot of fun and worth owning for a modest price . liked the cinematography a lot too . judge for yourself ."
5,Wolverine Rocked!,I don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews. My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly. This movie is an hour and a half of great entertainment. I've seen the previous three x-men movies and I must say I like Wolverine the best. By a long shot.
3,great movie but amz package was damaged,"love this movie, totally one of my all time faves being such an xman buff. decided to buy the dvd from amazon but received a busted package. not pleased at all"
5,Great movie,Great movie I'm a little biased because I'm a big fan of Xmen but even if I wan't It was really good explained alot for the people that don't know the comics. The effects and sound effects were very good 5 stars.
5,X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Single-Disc Edition),I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love the movie. I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
3,It's alright,"For fans of the wolverine, I think that this is a good entry point for the franchise and that's about it. No deep plot, no great acting and a lot of things don't make sense. If you can put all that aside and just enjoy mindless action and nostalgic characters from the comics, you will be ok."
1,Worst origin for Wolverine,"There are multiple origins for Wolverine. This is quite possible the worst. A forgetful cast, broken scenes (Logan gets smashed by a truck and tons of lumber fall on him BEFORE he gets the adamantium skeleton), predictable (stupid) plots and horrible writing. Anyone who has read the X-Men from the 1970's through to the 90's knows how mixed up the story is in this film. Add some Matrix and anime fun into this movie and you get a mixed salad of garbage. All other features on the blu ray disc are very well done. Do yourself a favor and read some of the old books or watch X-Men 1 and 2 which were not as bad as this shipwreck. Wolverine is basically a few steps short of simply being superman. Not the Wolvie I grew up liking. Thumbs down."
2,I wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like this movie. My wife and I went to see it while away from the kids for the night. I enjoyed the previous x-men movies (except number 3) and figured this had to be a better movie. It was dull beyond comparison. Blowing stuff up and non-stop fighting is getting old in the movies. We've seen it, we know what computers can do. There was virtually no character development whatsoever. Those of us who know the X-men want to know more about their lives, not just who they can fight. The entire story was incredibly predictable, so much so, that it got so painful to watch we didn't even stay for the last 15 minutes and asked for our money back.Yeah, there are some sharp effects, but other than that this movie scores as mundane and uninspiring. 2 stars. I expect to see it in the $5.00 Walmart bin within the year."
2,Awful movie.,"I have a seen a more obvious movie since ""Revenge of the Sith."" The part where Stryker says he's going to shoot Logan in the head with Adamantium bullets until he forgets everything made me groan in frustration. This movie was so retarded."
2,Whatta crapfest!,"I'm a big fan of X-men/Wolverine, so I was excited about this movie. Big disappointment. In the first 5 minutes, we see a young Logan grow out little baby bony claws. I immediately thought ""uh oh"", and boy was I right. I waited for it to get better, but it never did. Skip it. Revisit the Wolverine/X-men franchise in 5-10 years when they get new actors (or when CGI can make Hugh Jackman look about 30-35 again). Hugh's my age, and he seems like a great guy, but I'm too old to play Wolverine too. You've been warned."
3,not quite up the X-Men standard,"for me,this is the worst movie i have seen connected with the X-Men franchise.it's certainly watchable,but it's not up to the X Men standard.i found it slow at times.also,there are some continuity issues regarding this Wolverine and the Wolverine we see in the later X-Men movies as well as with the events themselves and how they play out in the later movies.Hugh Jackman was Fine as Wolverine,as he always has been.Liev Schrieber is good as Victor Creed.and i really liked Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool.i just wish he had a bigger role.as for the movie as a whole,it is above average,but as i said,not up to the X-Men standard.for me, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a 3/5"
3,Wolverine movie,"Going on my grandson's reaction and my son's okay with the movie, I will have to say that I'm satisfied with it. I'm not real crazy about those kinds of movies for children (my grandson is 11)but his parents okayed it and it made him happy more so than some I probably would have chosen. Price of the item and delivery time were exceptional. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to my order."
3,not what i expected,"well,for 2009,it was between this movie,the t4 and watchmen for movie of the year and this one lost.i liked it.dont get me wrong.its just that there were a bunch of errors.i guess i should expect that since not one comic book movie has been accurate yet.most of this movie was in the x-men trilogy.so all the answers were taken care of already.sabretooth was actualy wolverines dad.im pretty sure the xmen were the original mutant team.wolverine was dropped with one bullet in xmen 2 but absorbs hundreds in the first few minutes of this film.this dead pool guy showed up much later i thought too.these facts aside,the movie was pretty cool.the opening fight scenes were memorable.how old wolverine is ,is staggering.the action is cool.dead pool is awesome.there are a few lesser known mutants all through it in the later parts.this movie rocked!id give it second place for 2009 behind the watchmen and slightly above terminator salvation."
2,Highly overated,"When my friend let me borrow this DVD i thought it looked really cool but I was wrong. Overall the movie is Bad. The action is not that great and the story line is not great either this film is very overated. They hardly show cyclopse, Gambit, or any of the other characters. When i first saw the commercial the voice says ""im assembling a perfect team."" That team did not include Cyclopse or Gambit and the team was only in the movie for the beginning. Do not purchase the movie just rent it."
3,A bittersweet aftertaste,"For some reason, this movie was butchered by critics and, to be honest, it's full of ups and downs that leave audiences with a bittersweet aftertaste. There are incredible scenes that prove almost impossible to be shot, like that of the helicopter, but then, for some reason, high definition shows how poorly finished Wolverine's claws are in that bathroom scene.I don't think the story is worse than X-men III's, but it's almost impossible not to miss the underlying ideas of the Singer era. There is a second part coming. Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor. Let's hope the second part is a bit more interesting than this one!"
2,Disappointing movie,"The storyline is a bit lacking. I am a big fun of the xmen movie series and so my expectations for this movie was very high. I had a hard time following the plot of the movie. However, the special effects were great"
3,X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"It's an ok film, nothing really amazing that I would like in film, if you have nothing better to do, watch it."
1,Doubt the digital copy will play,"Love the movie and blu-ray is fun but but it sucks when it says it includes a digital copy that is iTunes and Mac compatible but it won't play in my iTunes on my iMac. So far I've had that with all 3 of the other X-Men series but all other (non rights managed) movies seem to play fine. They load in fine after the code key but then play 2 hours worth of grey screen with no sound. It's too bad, makes paying for a digital copy pointless. If you have iTunes and want a digital copy - you're better off with piracy! At least then, you're sure they'll play!! No way I'm buying anything else with a ""digital copy"" included until they get this fixed (yes, I've tried both contacting Apple (who tried to figure it out at least) and the studios (who just don't care as it doesn't affect everyone, yet)."
1,Never Pre-Order with Amazon,"I have had dreadful experience with Pre-Orders here at Amazon.In this instance, my order now reads ""projected shipping date 21 September"". are you kidding me? This DVD was released on 15 September and I PRE-ORDERED it. One day I will learn my lesson. I also pre-ordered Star Trek. I'm cancelling that one. I'm better off driving over to Walmart to buy my new DVD's."
2,Just another mindless Summer Blockbuster,I like a good Action packed Blockbuster if done right. This isn't. Just an excuse to get people in the theater with a poor script and Jackman doing his Macho deal with his Wolverine portrayal. It was bad enough in the X-men movies but this is just more of the same.I would have rather seen a movie with Cyclops.
5,X-Men Wolverine,"Not much of a fan of X-Men but really enjoyed ""Wolverine"". Fantastic action and great cast. The best of any X-Men movies so far."
5,"X_Men, continued","A great movie destined to be a classic, Wolverine is as cool as he was in the comic book when I was a kid. Well made with excellent fx, I recommend this for anyone, although there are parts not suitable for younger viewers."
3,X-Men Origins:Wolverine,"This movie to me seemed kind of forced. They Forced Gambit in there and they forced/raped deadpool's character. All in all, the movie like it most likely was intended seemed to be made for money. special effect wernt even that great. But the blu ray looked clean, helps see all the F ups."
3,Great Video and Audio,Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.The video quality was great. 9.5 out of a 10 point scale. Audio was great also. DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. 107 minutes long.I didn't think the movie was that good though.
3,Hot but too loud,"I bought this 1,100 watt heater for my camper because the 1,500 watt ceramic cube heater I had previously caused the circuit breaker to trip if it ran for a long time. This ceramic disc heater eliminates that problem and seems to put out just as much heat as the 1,500-watter. Unfortunately, the fan is significantly louder than the other heater. For such a high price, I expected fewer decibels."
5,Absolute classic,"This book not only is an invaluable factual resource for anyone interested in turtles, it's written in Carr's delightful and completely readable style. He says, for example, about people who intentionally run over turtles, that there ""is probably nothing much that can be done about these people except to hope they skid."" A great book for anyone who loves nature, turtles, or just good writing."
1,What A LOAD of CRAP!!!!,This should be rated 0 stars!! FRAUD IN THE HIGHEST SENSE! Ramblings of a burned out hippie! I would NOT recommend this tripe to any one.
3,Schizophrenic or Saint?,"This is a story about fragmented people in fragmented relationships, in a fragmented world. A fanciful tale of the interplay between the the spirits of the living and the dead or a brilliant case study of group delusion?"
2,"""Honey, they shrunk Database!!!""","First off... I love the Simpsons figures! They are an amazing line of well crafted and extremely well designed set of action figures! Lots of attention to details. Which is why this one figure in the line is so strange!!! On the Simpsons TV show, Database is one of the larger children in Bart's and Lisa's circle of friends. But for some reason, this figures is not only smaller than almost all the other children (he is still bigger than Maggie) but he is also disproportionate to the rest! It's like he is a large ""toy"" for the other toys to play with. Weird!! Playmates dropped the ball with this one, but I forgive them! Or at least I would if they would make a Jay Sherman Simpsons figure!"
1,I agree...!,"...I was talking with my brother about how small it was when I got it. So I guess alot of people think what I do. Database is supposed to be a big kid. And I want them to make Jay Sherman too! The Critic was a great show, He could be a celebrity figure. Since Jon Lovitz is the voice and they already have a celebrity one for him. Thanks"
5,Just like the one I had when I was little!,"I chose this shape sorter because of the retro factor... it's just like the ones I remember from when I was young. Others I've seen don't have as many shapes as this one (my son now knows 'trapezoid'!) and it is self-contained, durable and very portable. It's also multi-purpose... besides being used as a shape sorter toy, my son: rolls it around as a ball, shakes it up so the shapes rattle around inside, and we trace the shape pieces with a crayon to learn how to draw shapes. One of his favorite toys!"
1,Poor Quality,"Opened the box, removed the toy and it was immediately obvious that it was defective. The extremely thin plastic is deformed and the halves are not round, so they won't mate together and close properly. The toy I remember playing with as a child was very thick plastic, not like this flimsy thing. I'm extremely disappointed with the cost-cutting measures they've taken with this product."
3,Kind of Hard but OK,"I had this as a child and remember liking it. I bought it for my child though and didn't anymore much. It is really hard to open. When I pull the sides apart, I have to shake it all around to get the shapes to fall out. I know my little ones could never do this. I also don't really like the ball design because it is hard to find the correct hole. This toy is durable and nicely bright colored, but I prefer other shape toys."
2,Great product but incomplete and had to pay postage,The product was great but they left out one of the shapes. I contacted seller and they told me they would handle it and credit us the shipping that we ended up paying for above what was quoted when it arrived. They haven't contacted us back or sent missing shape. They were very responsive the first time but didn't follow through.
5,A great toy that's been around for ages!,We were glad to find that they still make this toy. Our children played with it endlessly. We were pleased to be able to buy one for our grandson
5,Wonderful and Exciting Learning,"Our children had one, although as I remember a little less pricy, but they all played with and enjoyed it so much that our oldest still has it in her cedar chest. Now it is our granddaughter's turn to learn and have fun."
5,Tupperware Ball,"I didn't want to spend the price for this ball, however, the mother of my 1 year old granddaughter wanted it because it had the shapes and sizes. We have one and it has been through 6 grandkids so I know that the durability of it is awesome. Walmart has cheaper type ones but I'm sure it wouldn't last like this one. Great product."
2,Your child will need your help to play with this!,"My 13 month-old likes this toy, but gets frustrated constantly. Once I help her put the pieces in (because it is quite complicated) all she wants me to do is take them out. She is frustrated she can't get them in or out by herself, and is frustrated even with me helping her. I'm going to buy the Fisher Price one where she can take the top off herself!! I spend lots of time with my kids, but need them to at least be able to play for 1 or 2 minutes without needing my help, and this is not the toy for that. Since its a ball, it is not sturdy for little hands to try to put pices in (unlike something that can sit flat on the ground). My 2 and 3 year-olds aren't enthralled with it either. I'm surprised so many people love it - didn't work for any of us and I just sold it on Craigslist!!"
2,Better for mom and dad than baby,"This is a ""parent"" shape sorter. While parents should be constantly involved with their children, the child should be able to operate a toy on their own. The problem with this shape sorter is that the child has too many pieces at the age it's designed for. Give your child too many pieces and they will get frustrated. Give them only the circle and they will find the spot and it goes in like ""magic""! No other piece is a starter piece for a child of 6 months. The ball is IMPOSSIBLE for a child to open on their own until they are past the age where this toy is developmentally appropriate. By the time they can open it, they should be on to much more advanced educational toys."
5,A Nearly Perfect Toy for very young children,"This is a ""tactile learning toy"" that my children played with over 40 years ago. My daughter specifically requested the Shape-O Ball for her daughter, who is only 7 months old, but is getting acquainted with it now.The primary colors are vivid and eye-catching.The shapes are too big to swallow, and have no sharp edges, and they each fit only in the specific opening.It doesn't talk, does not require batteries, and is very durable--a nearly perfect toy!"
5,Activity ball,My son is 18 months and loves putting the shapes in the ball and then have me open and dump them all back out. He is learning so well. It's great.
5,Love this toy for kids,"This is a toy that my sister had for each of her kids. It is indestructible, durable, educational and fun. I buy this for all my newborn baby gifts."
5,"Pinstripers, begin here","I have watched this video several times and I always get something more out of it. Steve ""Wizard"" Chaszeka is a good teacher, and an excellent striper. I have all three in this series.If you think pinstriping might be for you, follow the instruction in this video and you'll know exactly what you're getting into.The Dagger Style video and the Scroll Style videos are the next steps. Enjoy!"
3,Decent piece of cutlery,this knife looks great. I love the wood handle and the blade. the problem is that the blade is made from a non durable metal so it will lose it's edge almost immidiatly. I was surprised upon using this product. it was made in japan and I love Japanese knives but this is just a knock off. that being said if you don't mind sharpening your knife often it's a fairly nice buy for the price.
4,Comfort grip with a reasonable weight on the knife.,The handle provided a firm and comfortable grip. The blade is sharp and the weight of the knife gave firm slicing and chopping. Pretty satisfied with the purchase.
4,Great Kitchen Tool,The knife is well made and the blade is exceptionally sharp. The only draw-back is the handle which seems to small for the average hand.
2,The Movie is better,"I know this is just the soundtrack of the movie, but the music doesn't sound good by itself. As a soundtrack, this music is hard to add to playlist because it's not jazz or rock. So I don't listen to it regularly."
5,Odds and Ends added up,"This is an amazing album of B-Sides, 7"" releases, and unreleased music. The quality of the tracks is amazing, and it makes you wonder why it wasn't released as album material before now. The tracks are sometimes very different from each other, but that's what makes the collection great. Stay tuned after the last track, there's a hidden acoustic version of Better Off at the end, and it's great.Favorite Track: Better Off"
3,Hard to Clean,"While I agree these cups don't leak, they are difficult to get clean. The underside of the lid has crevasses around the mouth bit that are deep and narrow and almost impossible to get really clean. I have been using ours for awhile and regularly sterilizing in boiling water, but the residue build up in the lid has gotten to the point where I have to toss them and buy new sippy cups. Too bad, as they are great in the no-leak department. I will be buying a kleen kanteen sippy--no leaks, stainless steel and easy to clean."
4,Doesn't spill,"These cups don't spill, but the liquid comes out too fast for my daughter. She's 8 months and still on stage 1 nipples because she chokes easily, so that's not the cups fault. She was drinking water from these yesterday and had it running all down her chin then choked a little. So if your baby is fine with a faster flow... go for it! I'm hoping to use these once she's a little older since they really don't leak at all. She kept holding it upside down and tossing it and nothing came out!"
5,sippy cups,Have been on a quest to find a sippy cup that does not leak and I think these might be the ones. I have tried a lot and these are by far my favorite in the leaking dept.
5,sippy cup,The playtex spill proof cup is the only sippy that my child will use. The only time they ever leak is if they are dropped from a big height onto a very hard surface.
4,Nice cups,"My sons have used these cups for more than two years now. Both boys found them easy to hold and balance. The cups take abuse well. In two years, none of ours have broken. Despite this sturdiness, they are not heavy.They infrequently leak from the spout and very, very rarely from anywhere else. The lids fit well. The valve inserts easily and stays in place even when the cup is dropped. Replacement valves are readily available, however in two years I've never needed to replace a valve because it's worn out.There are a few negatives, though. The spouts do wear quite a bit with children with teeth. With the opaque cup it's hard to see how much liquid, especially water or milk, is in the cup. The ridges on the lid tend to collect food from the child's hand. The lid cleans well in the dishwasher, but it's not easy to clean the ridges with a quick wipe.Weighing the positives and negatives, this is our sippy cup of choice."
5,great!,"does not leak,relatively easy to clean,nothing to chew trough (it is amazing that a replacement part for a soft spout may cost as much as a new sippy)and yes, the bottle is finally gone!"
2,kinda sad,"when they say colors may vary, they actually mean that your princess cups may, in fact, be dump truck cups."
2,Pay attention to wording,Pay careful attention to the wording. I tried to order some girly sippy cups like the ones pictured but ended up with dump trucks and dinosaurs. I guess dump trucks and dinosaurs it will be :/
5,"A Treasure of Insight, Perception and Beauty","A rare work of discourse on the divine through pith prose condensed with deep meaning and essays on the nature of God, man and the universe.This along with the second volume contain some of the most intelligently written clear expressions and descriptions of our universe and the nature of that which we call 'God'.An illumining work that can be savoured intellectually and appreciated for it's beauty in the depths of ones heart.Highly Recommended."
1,What no SNELL?,"The CL series all have SNELL ratings, except the XXXL size. I was disqualified for a race as a result. Too bad I don't know how to shrink my head..."
5,This book is an awsome book to look cards in,"The beckett book was a great sorce to me because I have been collecting baseball cards sence I was 3 yr old and because I have over 7,000 cards so I think this book will be a good sorce for you to."
3,Nice but too little letters !,A really nice guide plenty of little letters... you'll need a magnifying glass to read it !
5,Letters to the Corinthins(New Daily Study Bible),"Arrived in excellent shape and rapidly.As always, Barclay takes the Bible and relates it to the time it was written and then to what it means today. Although written over 50 years ago, his works are still most helpful as people haven't changed much."
1,Waste of money!,"Well... I know kitchens in the USA are usually larger than the ones in Europe but even then... most kitchens shown in this book are 3 to 4 times bigger than my current kitchen. The book does NOT give you planning tips, no clever cabinet interiors, just pictures of finished kitchens, not even info on how that finished kitchen came to be.So if you are looking for clever ideas for making the most of small kitchens, DO NOT buy this book!Petra"
5,Vida is Passion,"Well, here's Chico Buarque after more than 15 years of composing... And it's becoming always better! Vida is the first song in the album... well... it's one of the most amazing songs that i've ever heard in my life about Vida(Vida means Life, in portuguese). It's a passionate song sang with a unique passion that make any person vibrate. There's no electric guitars, digital efects and (as the whole album and Chico whole career) all that stuff... it's a gem in its accoustic simplicity. The others songs are quite great and reveals a brazilian composer that is simply a genius and an album that's simply one of Chico's best."
4,From Sesame Street,"This is basically an episode of Sesame Street. It is fine, but I could just record & save the Sesame Street. Of course this has the advantage of being portable for viewing in the car or wherever."
4,I swear that Sarai truly is Original!,"I finally got my hands on the debut album by Sarai, and I have to say that I loved every single track, from the Intro to'Black & White' this album is off da hook!My only complaint is that there are only 12 songs on there, cuz by the time I reached the last track I was hungry for more!Don't get it twisted, this girl has got major league skills, with a style that truly original and her own. Don't try to compare her to anyone else, cuz when it comes to Sarai, there is no comparison. Don't even try to compare her to Eminem, the only thing that she has in common with Slim Shady is the color of their skin.The album itself is balanced well with bass-thumping tracks meant to get the party started, songs of female empowerment and independence, along with rhymes that deal with the darker and deeper subject matters of child abuse and teen pregnancy.Sarai has got a bright future, so by all means, cop the album you won't regret it!"
3,somewhat surprising...,"I first heard the song ""Ladies"" on the radio and i was kinda surprised when i found out that the rapper was white. I've only heard that song so far but i think its strait that there's a white female rapper out there now."
3,QUESTION OF THE DAY...,"How many of the reviewers that are NOT saying nice things about Sarai, have a cd out on the record store shelves let alone a song that is tearin' it up across the country ? That's what I thought... Who cares what color she is and since when was rap or any kind of music a black or white issue ?"
1,not all what it's hyped to be,"Does anyone remeber in 1991 the white girl rapper who did the song ""Pump It?"" Not many...i heard ""Ladies"" on the radio. I never really got into it. It sounded too hyper and annoyed me. I listened to the rest of her cd, though. A lot of it kind of sounds the same. A little bit of a calypso sound to most of them.It wasn't that great of an idea for her to come out with ""Ladies"" first. People get the idea the whole cd will sound like that when it doesn't. She's not really bringing anything to hip-hop. Maybe Sarai's just trying it out. Hip-hop has yet to see the ""great white female rapper."""
1,YEAH RIGHT WHITE GIRL!!!!,ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!JUST BECAUSE EMINEM DOES A GREAT JOB AT WHAT HE DOESDOESNT MEAN EVERYONE CAN DO IT.
2,"Eminem Didn't Open This Door, Ever heard of the Beastie Boys","C'mon Sarai do your research. Third Bass were great white rappers but just like in sports when something is popular and marketed well the money starts pouring in. While I think you have talent and I'm not hatin' on you, you've bragged on yourself in tabloids and compared yourself to Eminem. You are not bringing a style to the table that warrants lots of discussion. Eminem is a profound rapper but he really just sounds black, not always like a great rapper ie: Tupac, JayZ, LL Cool J. Your style is ok. I heard it before. Just don't pull the race card here. If you were black you'd be ok. So you're a pretty white girl. I'm feelin you. You're still ok."
1,"""Stop tripping off my peoples!""","Who does she think she is anyway!First Eniemen,now her.I`ll tell ya straight off my back we can`t keep our music for a second!Also widt here lame old song called ""Ladies"".Ill tell you what I won`t get it that`s fo sho.Also next time she has another video if she can afford it it needs to have a better choeogropher. Peace 2 U!"
1,Wack,"This is a sorry excuse for hip hop music for anybody to call this woman the female eminem is an (wrong). eminem is a talented and inspiring mc. this is total (garbage) and her record label should be sued for alowing this kind of poisen to reach the ears of there lisenters. so if you buy this album all you do is set a horrible presitent and alow more garbage and more (garbage) to hit the airways to tell the youth that did not grow up knowing hip hop classics like big ready to die or nas illmatic and, that this an acceptable way to produce an amazing artform. this is horrible."
2,NO WAY JOSE YO ! PRINCESS SUPERSTAR SHOULD HAVE MORE HYPE,PRINCESS SUPERSTAR WAS A WHITE FEMAL RAPPER IN THE DAYS OF 93 AND WAS PLAYING THIS RAP GAME BEFORE EM AND SARAI EVER RELEASED THERE FIRST ALBUM. WELL TO MOVE ON NOW SARAI IS GOOD BUT TOO LATE SHE NEEDS TO CHANGE HER SOUND BECAUSE SHE SOUNDS LIKE MY GIRLFRIEND TRINA.
2,Pretty silly,"Sarai doesn't seem to know who she wants to be: MTV pop, hard core, or a member of Linkin Park. I think comparing her to Eminem does Eminem an injustice, and it doesn't accurately describe Sarai. Her lame rhymes and overproduced sound almost makes me laugh, as if she is parodying Slim Shady. She tries to tell us she's independent, but her content sounds a little too much like other hard core rappers for me to believe her. I don't think we'll see Sarai much in the future."
1,This is the kind of garbage thats giving hip hop a bad name,"Being a long time hip hop listener, I gotta say that this album is straight wack with a capital W. Not one song on here is hot, and the whole album is nothing more than garbage. And she thinks she's fine too. She look like Paris Hilton's twin sister. What she needs to do is go back to whateva she was doing before she made this album. Sarai a little advice, before you put out an album, make sure your lyrics and flows are creative. Peace."
2,medicine rattled!,"I expected to hear something totally different when I popped in the CD. First of all, they sound much better live than they do on this recording. Second, with Billy Zoom from the band X producing the CD, I expected him to capture their raw, country/rockabiily-tinged ""X-ish"" sound. But the production quality is weak; a REALLY weak guitar sound (c'mon Billy), way too much yodeling from the singer, and watered down versions of the songs I've heard them play time and time again. Only a couple of the songs on the CD captured the energy they've displayed on the Los Angeles club circuit. Overall: very dissapointing."
5,My husband claimed it as his,"This is something you'll be glad to have more than one of. We chose a Pooh theme for our baby and when my husband saw this one he claimed it as HIS (because of its masculinity). So he used this one to keep in his car, and I had several others. It is roomy inside and easy to clean because it was machine washable. And to think this particular bag wasn't an item I actually registered for!"
2,Not what I expected,This software isn't particularly useful. It allows you to record your test results but that is the end of it's usefullness. There is no code lookup within this program. I assumed I needed the software to get full usefullness out of my code reader but that isn't accurate. I wouldn't purchase this software again.
2,"not too bad, not what was expected","Does exactly what it says and nothing more. Only allows you yo get basic updates from web. You have to purchase alot of other upgrades to get much of the functionality that one might desire from this product. It Also came in damaged packaging like it had been had been opened at the factory and then someone tried to put it back in without sucess. The cd was a little scuffed up like it had been used before, but the software still installed fine. Does it work; yes. Would i buyit agian; no."
2,AutoXray EZ-PC 500,I got this Item form Amazon and I made it perfectly clear 2x's to make sure the pc cabel came with my purchase.An was told yes both. When it arrived no cabel.Complained and returned and was credited back to paypal.
5,AutoXray Ez-Pc500-510 software,"This product does just what is says and no bs. i first thought it was faulty when i saw something about microsoft xp not checking it to see if it was compatible , but it works so far flawlessly. this is a needed item if you want to print out trouble codes to take to mechanics and keep data on file about what ever scans you do on your vehicles. worth every penny."
1,Inaccurate,"This article uncritically discusses the findings of CDC's fatally flawed study on childhood stress and ME. The study used the CDC's Reeves Criteria for ""CFS"" which has been proven in the literature to be completely invalid."
4,More from a cookbook junkie!,"This could be a precursor to all those Mediterranean diet books. Naturally, I start all my purchases with research: test drive it at the library first, and then see if you have to have it. The history, the stories, and finally the recipes make this a keeper. Granted, the paperback doesn't have all the recipes the later edition hardcover has, but, it's easier to store! Besides, comparing the two editions, copy a missing recipe, insert it, and all is well. All the recipes are RIDICULOUSLY simple--and the food is the star, not big on the dressy stuff. You get to taste the product (""St Peter's fish"" is my fave). It plays into the current local foods movement very well, with the Bible history right there showing Bible folk were the ultimate locavores, eating what they grew or caught right where they were. It's a nice guide, and proves again what Solomon said: there is NO new thing under sun!"
2,Songs coast along easily but no magic in the journey,First song has a catchy melody but actually grows tiresome within three and a half minutes. The rest of the tracks just don't have much to recommend - competently played but no invention or intrigue.
2,I expected more from this cd.,"My personal opinion Sizzla is getting very boring. The best Sizzla cd's are BLACK,WOMAN &CHILD-PRAISE YE JAH & FREEDOM CRY.He is a good artist but he needs to experiment some more musically."
1,Rib Cap Danger,"Rib Caps are fine as long as they stay on the head. The problem occurred when the conditions were heavy snow and the Ribcap became very wet. I crashed twice and the Ribcap fell off both times. Not only did the Ribcap not protect at all as it flew off, I then had to retrieve the Ribcap from down the slope.Some Ribcaps have ties to secure them but I feel that the non secured Caps are very dangerous as they expand when wet and give a false illusion of protection.I believe that these products should be withdrawn immediately before someone seriously hurts themselves."
3,Cheap ram,"It is what it is. Cheap ram. My comp skips and sputters with this ram but whatever, there's not much out there in this older ram so you have to go with what you can get."
4,Good Price. Cheaper than Fry's Electronics,And computer ran much faster and so far so good. No problems from kingston.Very good Price and cheaper than ebay too. Brand new too.
1,In review of the seller,I placed an order for this Kingston memory stick only to have my order cancelled without explanation. Very lousy customer service.
1,Mislabeled DIMM memory,"The Kingston 1GB RAM arrived in a timely manner but the memory size did not match the label on the Memory stick. When installed, it registered 500MB, not 1GB. If this review results in a corrective action and a new 1GB chip is sent to me, I will mail back the mislabeled memory. I own an HP Pavilion s7620n with 1GB memory already in it but not Kingston brand. When I installed the Kingston memory, I also observed some instability over time (reboot) so I removed it.KRH"
4,Good value RAM,Very good value RAM for upgrade your PC I have an 5 year old HP media center and I upgraded form 2 to 4GB. I see a slight increase in overall speed of the PC.
5,So good!,I finally purchased this for my parents desktop computer. Was simple to set up. Nothing but good thoughts about this!!!
1,Software issues after plug-in of DIMMs,"Purchased qty 2 of the Kingston ValueRAM 1GB 533MHZ DDR2. I wanted to increase my server from 2G to 4G. I matched up the proper Gig and speed as the other two Kingston DIMMs in the server. The server showed that there was an increase of memory from 2 Gig to 4 gig, however, some of the applications on the server would not display properly. I had to remove the new DIMMs for my applications to work. I would not recommend these to anyone. Wish I had the money and time back that I spent on using this poor product."
5,Finally a Memory that worked!,"My Mother has an older HP Desktop with XP. Normally you can use any ones PC-2 4200 or other speed PC-2 memory, not in her computer. I finally read online that it needs to be one compatible with HP's timing or something, so I bought this one.IT WORKS GREAT!My Mother is very happy, the computer went from being unusable to fast. It used to take 20 min. to boot and then another couple of min. for something to happen every time you hit a mouse button. Now it just works great.Buy this one if your old computer calls for this type and you want to resurrect it."
4,Loved Mary Poppins Doll,"My three-year-old is obsessed with Mary Poppins, so we got this as a surprise birthday gift and she loved it! My only objection, from a harried parent's point of view, would be the umbrella, which is not perminantly attached to the doll and can easily be misplaced if not vigilant. Also the pretty little red string tying the cloth of the umbrella simply unties and can easily be lost, allowing the cloth to fall from the umbrella stick. And what is Mary Poppins without her umbrella? Otherwise, lovely doll."
3,Don't get the Mary/Bert Combo,"The Marry Poppins doll showed up fine and in great condition. The Bert doll, however, never showed up. I was sent an email saying that it will take longer to try and find the doll I purchased. I then get an email a few weeks later saying that the doll was located, but it will not be shipped for another 3 weeks. I then finally get ANOTHER email saying that there has been some kind of problem charging my credit card. The entire purchasing experience has been VERY disappointing. I have since went ahead and cancelled the purchase of the Bert doll and went to a local toy store and bought the doll, like I should have done from the very beginning."
5,Great doll,"The doll is great. My 2year old and 2yr old niece are obsessed w/Mary Poppins and the doll is a bargain. It is geared more towards collectors or older children. The hat is attached to her head w/plastic ties and if you remove it won't properly stay. The umbrella doesn't stay well in her hand so you do have to keep track of it, but it has the detail of the parrot head on it. The umbrella is intended just as a prop, it doesn't open up- its just the cloth w/a ribbon around it. All in all it is a really cute doll and a great bargain. She has great detail and is made really well. Her hair is perfectly styled and the curls are sewn in place to stay nice, the only thing that really bothered the girls was the umbrella not being a working little umbrella, but I would absolutely still buy it knowing that now."
4,A must read for screenwriters!,"Write Screenplays That Sell, by Hal Ackerman is a thorough, clear, concise and practical manual for writing screenplays. The reader is given useful ideas and techniques that will enable them to build their story idea into a screenplay scene-by-scene. I enjoyed the writer's GYM EXERCISE at the end of each chapter. It involves the student while they are learning and that always contributes to a more satisfying learning process.Ackerman's book is an excellent resource for people who want to learn how to write a solid screenplay, a book to add to your reference library of writing tools. If you're serious about screenwriting you'll refer to it again and again.Armchair Interviews says: Write Screenplays That Sell is not a loaner book. Direct would-be borrowers to the nearest bookstore to get a copy of their own."
3,Not finding the Drifters classic recording?,"If you're looking for the wonderful Doo-Wop classic recording of White Christmas by The Drifters, it's the feature track on the ""White Christmas and Other Doo Wop Christmas Classics"" CD, also available on Amazon.Other CD versions:Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters:""Rockin' & Driftin' Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters""- and -""Soul Christmas"""
1,Unhappy Holidays...,"If you're looking for the Drifters' classic '50s version of ""White Christmas,"" look elsewhere. These are amateurish recent recordings by an anonymous-sounding group. The personnel isn't specified in the packaging, but I'd be very surprised if any members of the real Drifters had anything to do with these tracks."
2,"At least ""O Holy Night"" is superb","While the other reviewers are correct about this being mostly (or maybe even all) remakes, this version of ""O Holy Night"" is spectacular. I have attempted to determine if it is a remake by comparisons (listening back and forth between other sources) and finally decided that IF it is a remake then the artist did an unbelievable job of matching the original. It does sound remastered which may indicate a remake but either way this song will give you goose bumps. Listen for yourself and you will at least download ""O Holy Night""."
1,fault in printing,"words ran into book binding, sentances faded in the middleappears to be a photocopy of the orignal, some pages too dark too read while others too lightwill not purchase from this publisher againReal shame- I'm a huge Hawthrone fan and needed to purchase the book again"
1,poor photocopy,"I got this for my son who loves Greek myths. I thought this version would be a good one because it said it was a photocopy and totally unabridged. However, the photocopy is so poor that he can't even read it! Some of the pages are only half photocopied, so they are missing half the words. Some of the pages are mixed up and out of order. He eventually gave up trying!"
2,hm,i bought this movie because of gary daniels. but there i like one good fight scene. the rest of the movie is whack
2,Generic and uninspired,"One of the more generic martial arts films released as of late, Fatal Blade is an uninspired and droll film that features Gary Daniels as another cliche renegade cop that plays outside the rules. Contrary to the movie's box art, Mr. Daniels hardly wields a katana in this flick, and the few action scenes which could have been somewhat gratifying are played in fast-forwards, making them appear cheesy and goofy, instead of exciting. If you're a fan of Gary Daniels (all three of you), check out some of his better performances, such as Fist of the North Star and stay away from this turkey."
2,Not Good For A First Read.,"I found this book to be too wordy. Theorems are sometimes stated without proofs then followed by several corollaries with proof, followed finally by the proof of the original theorem. Allusions are made to geometry unfamiliar to some learning the basics of commutative ring theory. A nice book to come back to."
1,Paper and print,These springer print on demand books should be labelled low quality for their paper and print. Pages are very thick printed with the lowest quality setting.
4,Not for the beginner,"Well, the strength of this book lies in where it takes you. There is so much material here that when finished, you'll be prepared for a lot. Personally I think it is too wordy (my preferance is Atiyah & MacDonald) and the typesetting overall isn't all that impressive, so read up or consult other texts before/during your first encounter. M.Reids book is a better place to start."
3,The text itself is great. The paperback book isn't.,"The text itself is great -- it fills in all the background Hartshorne inexplicably assumes you'll be familiar with in a clear and well-motivated way. You should definitely read it.My low rating pertains specifically to the paperback binding. This book is 800 pages long, and despite being printed on what appears to be very thin paper the book is twice as thick as nearly any other book I own. The paperback binding simply isn't up to the task of holding the book together -- if you read anything that isn't in the middle couple of chapters, it develops permanent creases. I expect my copy will have fallen completely apart within a month or so.Honestly, this book should have been split into two volumes or something, because the current size is absurdly unwieldy. As things stand, I'd recommend trying to find a hardcover or eBook edition."
4,Good book of reference,"I purchased this as a book of reference. When I want to know something about Commutative Algebra (while reading Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometrry), I like a standard book of reference. But it seems a good book to learn commutative algebra aswell."
4,Happy E6 Pop,"Kevin and David Barnes, the musician and the artist, respectively, have put together many fun, artsy, pop albums. Aldhils Arboretum is more of the same. As most people know, Of Montreal's vocals can become grating if taken in large doses, but as most of their albums are brief, I think listening to any of their cds individually will provide delight rather than agony. Some songs on here are really well-written and radio-friendly, too bad bands like this never get their cut of the pie. Jennifer Louise is an amazing tune, and Old People In The Cemetary and Pancakes For One are also very good. Fans of happy, guitar-driven pop will probably enjoy this. Give it a shot."
3,not as good as the old of mont,"this had no cute little songs that i could fall in love with, sadly. like montreal on cherry peel or dustin hoffmans wife... on the 4 track sessions. sadness of my heartsoul. but it was still good."
4,"For me, a good introduction to a great band","First of all, download track one (Doing Nothing). If you like that song, buy this album as the rest will certainly appeal to you. Full of storytelling gems, this album reminds me of so many moments in my life. ""Old People in the Cemetery"" just offers such beautiful imagery. The catchiness of ""Jennifer Louise"" will remind you of a forgotten cousin. ""Pancakes For One"" is the perfect song for a breakup, while ""Kissing in the Grass"", with its haunting clarinet, makes you wish you had a lover again.An album that reminds me of The Apples In Stereo and of the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" couldn't be bad, and it isn't.Although a friend of mine disparaged this as a Beatles ripoff, 60s pop influences don't make it that. Instead it is an intelligent album that is definitely one of the top 10 of the year.Give ""Aldhils Arboretum"" and Of Montreal a chance."
1,Aldhis Arboredum,The one side was sratched. Was for grandson for Christmas. Record was defective. This is disappointibg. Thought merchant were be more respectable witg the quality.
2,Poor quality and very overpriced,"I had assumed that, for the $40+ price, that I would receive a thick, laminated, ready to hang chart. I was very disappointed when the item arrived. It is thin flimsy paper with no method for mounting or hanging. The item description is quite vague, but the price was so high that I assumed... -- very dangerous. This chart should retail in the $10 range -- no more. On the plus side, it is colorful. But you will need to have it mounted or framed before you can use it."
2,This one helped catch me up on my sleep,"Sorry to disagree with some of the other reviewers, but this comic bored me. Art below average, plot about middling. For some really well put together stuff, check out Dark Horse Comic's line of Alien graphic novels. These are well written and feature absolutely gorgeous artwork, text with pictures in a kind of storyboard effect. This particular comic suffers in the comparison."
4,The title says it all....,The book isn't big enough to contain all the action that it promises. Great story but it leaves you wanting more and more!
2,Convoluted and contrived.,"Which is fair enough. I mean, to get these three classic movie bad guys together, you need to bend a few rules. A damn good idea, but in this case, extremely poorly executed. They should have just left it alone. One star for the monsters, one star for the cover."
2,Oh Brother...,"This is pathetic. A spin off of Alien Ressurection is bad enough, but to mix it with the terminator is complete stupidity. And then to make me disgusted to say that the predator is my favorite movie hurts. this is a good concept, but it really needs to be redone and fast."
2,Don't be fooled!,"Trust me, because I was. It may sound like a good idea to throw these three iconic monsters together,... but alas, there is always the problem with execution, yeah? Convoluted and contrived in the extreme. Definitely leaves a sour taste like the last silly Alien movie did. And I personally thought that the manga styled art was too benign looking and underwhelming for characters of such a terrifying and imposing nature. Good for a laugh maybe, but little else."
4,"Hillarious game -- 5 star for the first few games, but it doesn't have much replay value","A game with a hillarious premise: A bunch of pirates are locked in a dungeon. It's a chaotic jailbreak where you try and reach the escape boat while preventing your opponents from doing so. The boat leaves as soon as one player gets all his/her crew on it, stranding the other players behind.How can you not love a game involving both pirates and a prison break?Anyhow, the game is accessible and hillarious the first few playthoughs and is perfect for introducing non-gamers into the fun world of ""german"" boardgaming. Not much depth (that I'm aware of) so it would grow old after a while. Still, a keeper!"
2,Greek Music Not Flamenco,The CD and other armik CDs all sound like Greek music. I have a Greek CD I purchased in Greece. I can find some melodies sound exactly the same. It also sounds like Iranian music.This music is not flamenco flame or gypsy or new flamenco. I recommend Spanish artists.
5,Fabulous! Soothing! Romantic! Exotic!,"I was walking in Venice Beach and heard this playing at a local shop! I bought it immediately and have not been able to stop playing since. Gypsy Flame, Dancing Shadows and Tear Drops are among my favorites. This album made me want to ""Dance as if noone was watching and love like I've never been hurt"".Regardless of where I am when listening to Gypsy Flame, I feel transported to another place and time. It's romantic, exotic, and mysterious all rolled into one.Gypsy Flame makes me feel like a 'gypsy'!If you are looking for something different, THIS is IT! The cd cover is merely a hint of the wonderful music within! After listening to the cd- I took a good look at the cd cover and it made perfect sense.Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!"
5,Livens up the creative side of your brain.,"If you love Flamenco music with a flair for gypsy tunes, this is the music for you. Armik plays masterfully the tunes that liven up the creativity. I use all his CDs as I write. It makes me dream, makes me see my characters come to life. He is a master with his guitar."
5,WONDERFUL FLAMENCO GUITAR!,What a beautifully recorded passionately played Flamenco guitar CD this is. It's very melodic and lush throughout. If you like Flamenco guitar then you'll love this CD.
5,Truly upbeat and easy to listen to - don't miss it,Armik plays wonderful Spanish flemenco music. It's upbeat and scintillating - a must for Guitar lovers.
5,Armik-Artist Extraordinaire!,Artist is a fantastic guitarist! Get this CD and all of his CD's. You won't be disappointed.
3,Armik is not a Flamenco Guitarist and his music too.,"I listened to the samples and I liked few tracks. But It is not nice to say that ""Armik is master of Flamenco"" while he does not play flamenco music. He has his own style but not Flamenco style."
1,"Supposedly ""updated"" edition has no new information","I picked up the ""1999 Academy Awards Handbook"" a couple of years ago, and I liked it. So when I saw this ""Revised and updated 2001 edition"", I thought I would buy it. There is no revision, no update, no new information whatsoever. This is exactly the same book with a new cover. The information ends with the 1998 Academy Awards, just like the 1999 edition did. Talk about false advertising! John Harkness and his publisher, Kensington, ought to be ashamed. I have no doubt that they did the same thing for the ""Revised and updated 2002 edition"". Caveat emptor!"
1,its ok,my favorite song on here is [ god will take care of you ] other then that the album gets a grade d now don't get me wrong i am a out of eden fan i have all of there albums for real but this album i felt they could of added better music
3,Good CD,"As usual people on Amazon over rate things. the CD is good, no doubt though. the best songs are immortal invisble and have mMercy adn Praie to the Lord.I didn't like much of OUT of Edens other albums but this one is better than the rest."
1,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1949),Don't waste your money. The dvd is not this movie it is a old tv versionwith different actors.
3,I gave it three stars because .5 rounds to one,Some of the samples are rough in terms of audio quality and the better the system you have the worse these tracks are. Its a shame too because I agree with the other review. A fair portion of this disc is fresh and creative but urine poor studio work is just that. Here is hoping they bought better gear or rented time at a quality studio.
4,Not Bad,"Well I was reluctant to buy this CD solely because it has T-Nutty's name on it. After one quick listen mainly the songs Nutty rapped on, I was a little unimpressed. However, after careful listening of the whole cd it was better than I had expected. The beats were fresh. The lyrics were aiight, and all in all it's a good cd. Definately good enough to hold me over until ""Nutt Factor"" or the Nutt Facor Project comes out. Look out for those."
3,A day in the life of Franco's Spain.,"""The Hive"" is the story of a coffee shop in Spain, frequented by a wide assortment of every-day Spanish citizens. It is an interesting narrative of colorful characters. There are a few tense moments when one realizes the fact that this is the Spain of Franco's rule, and a character runs afoul of the authorities once or twice, but by and large, this is a normal novel with an interesting story to tell. It is enjoyable to read and nice to follow the various characters, but Cela will remind the astute reader in a very subtle fashion, but an unequivocal one, that this is Franco's Spain, an isolated universe of political peril, giving this novel a second tier, a dark cloud which overhangs the proceedings. Readers who enjoy the multivarious tales of small town inhabitants and their common taverns, or readers who enjoy stories of early twentieth-century Spain will enjoy this story particularly."
3,Still hits the nail on the head!,I read this book in the early 70s as a very young bride. It was good then and still hits the nail on the head. Every woman should read these letters and practice the advice/suggetions written there. 34 years later I ordered this book for my son's fiance to read before he marries. How awesome is that?!
4,Great Insight!!!!,"In his book, Dr. Charlie Shedd gives some really great advices and hints on healthy marriage relationships. I especially like the way Dr. Shedd wrote the letters. Each one of them is terse and direct to the point. Some of which are quit humorous. This book discusses important issues such as communication, sex, honesty, fights, apology and even housekeeping. By reading this book, one will learn many new truths about a successful marriage. I am perticularly fond of this book because it stresses the significant rold God plays in relationships. Often times people tend to believe they can find a resolution by their own abilities. Yet they ignore the fact that God should be placed first. Overall, I agree with most of Dr. Shedd's points. And I recommend anyone who has a serious attitude toward marriage to read this book!!!"
4,Review on Letters to Karen,"Letters to Karen was a great book. I really enjoyed it. This book is about A daughter who askes her father for advice on love and marriage because she just got engaged. The father writes a series of letters with advice on relationships. You don't have to be married to read this book. It helps you understand the opposite sex more better. I am happy I read this bookk, it taught me a lot on relationships and how I should handle things. It also made me think about what kind of wife I should be to my husband. I loved the stories Dr. Shedd had to write about they were interesting and funny. This book has a lot of good pionts and examples. This is an excellent book I recommend it to anyone who plans on getting married or is married."
4,The Mysteries of Marriage,"Overall, I would rate Letters to Karen very high. I thought that it was packed full of good advice covering a variety of topics such as sexual relations, communications, and cooking. Every wife needs a few helpful hints. It definitely pushes the point that God needs to be the center of a relationship; then the inevitable trials will only strengthen one's marriage. I have to admit though that I am more traditional than the average. Many of the comments made could possibly be offensive to a feminist now days. The short letters made the book enjoyable and easier to read. Especially if someone was interested in a specific topic. I would recommend Letters to Karen to anyone getting married and plan to reread it later."
3,useful advice,this book gives great advice to those who are engaged or wish to get married. this book is about a loving father that gives useful advice to his daughter who is about to get married. this book taught me about different problems that come up when in a relationship and how to deal with them. i think that karen is very fortunate to have such a loving father that is willing to give advice along with personal situations that he found himself in. karens father has a great relationship with his daughter because he tells her whatever is on his mind. when i become a parent i will do my best to have a good relationship with my children just as karen's father was to her. i would recommend this book because people can learn alot about marraige though the letters of karen's father.
5,"Walker, Texas Ranger",I bought the book for my 12 year old daughter...who's a BIG Walker fan...and she says it's a good book.
1,Undemanding fare for Walker/Norris followers.,"A fairly non-descript tie-in for Norris' morality/martial arts-lite tv vechicle. There is a great character submerged here, i.e Lone Wolf Gonzales upon whom the earlier incarnation of Walker was derived, but, heartbreakingly, here, in Reasoners novel as with the tv show, the grittiness and any much needed depth is absent. Perfuctionary stuff as it is, Walker is a difficult figure not to warm to, as this book demonstrates, but one gets to feel almost as frustrated as the real life Texas ranger may have, in the sense that his true colours and abilities, and ironically, those of Norris' are being diluted, understandably, for mass appeal. Walker needs to get down and dirty to make the character breathe, and unfortunately this offering barely touches the surface. Still, if Walker does it for you, great, but, for this reader and viewer Norris' original take on this theme, JJ McQuade holds far more creditable dimension and weight."
5,Great Reference for Thorny Relationship Issues,"CREATIVE AGGRESSION is an out of print 1974 book that I was able to obtain through one of your third party vendors. It came highly recommended to me by a practicing psychologist as a book he often references when dealing with individuals experiencing thorny relationships. I find the information and principles put forth by authors Dr George R. Bach and Dr. Herb Goldberg to be EXTREMELY informative and helpful in working with people at all levels...work colleagues, family members and friendships."
3,gift,"My husbands cousin thought these were hillarious. Her daughter took them back to college. They appreciated the humor due to they just got 12 ""real"" chicks."
4,Big Flag,"Couldn't believe how big this flag turned out to be! Bought it for my husband and he hung it in the garage (man cave)! He loved it and it appears to be made well, as long as you don't use it outside."
3,okay,The flag feels cheap and thin. I wouldn't fly this outdoors because it'll probably fray pretty quickly. I hang it indoors and is just fine there.
5,Niagara 1953,"A vacation couple , George and Rose Loomis (Joseph Cotten 1905-1994 / Marilyn Monroe 1926-1962) , rent a quaint bungalow at romantic Niagara Falls , N.Y . But Rose and her lover plan to murder the unsuspecting George - in the falls ! A dramatic departure from her more upbeat roles , Monroe's fascinating performance as the scheming murderess paints a powerful dark portrait of human sexuality . High Quality Transfer ."
5,Eleanor Parker's pulchritude,"Eleanor Parker is just as beautiful as Monroe, but her breasts are smaller.Watch Parker act up a storm in ""Interrupted Melody"", playing the polio-stricken opera diva Marjorie Lawrence."
5,Classic movie in Niagara Falls,Loved ordering this movie streamed. Recently vacationed in Niagara Falls and wanted to see the landmarks in the movie to compare to today. Great quality movie. Marilyn Monroe was good in this movie and I love Joseph Cotton. Tiamo
5,Neat little thriller,"A movie that you can watch repetively and enjoy deserves 5 Stars anytime and ""NIAGRA"" is one of those movies. Apart from excellent photograhy/direction/acting it holds the viewer until the end. Monroe was not a bad actress either and this role proved it,also Joseph Cotten had one of his better roles as the jilted husband. The DVD is excellent and the Niagra Falls view enhances the tension throughout. A treasure"
4,Video Transfer is Top Notch.... Why only Full Screen???,"The Video transfer is outstanding. Very sharp, clear and vivid picture. It competes with today's market. I've never seen a transfer this good. But why waste thier time with only 'Full Screen'. Why is there no 'Widescreen Version'? I gave this title 5 stars but only 4 would fit on the screen."
3,Hanna D.: The,"There's a lot of marvelous, nostalgic full-frontal nudity but Hanna D: The Girl from Vondel Park should've been kept just that: Secret.The acting is horrible and the story is just not credible in the least. If you're looking for something dark, dreary and full of nonsensical sex, then this is for the person who wants to just burn a fun 88 minutes of their time."
3,Zingen und guitarstrummen der bamalama,"Quick - can you use the words ""punk"", ""fun"", and ""German"" in a sentence? Now you can."
4,Drama Teacher Gives Book on Playwrighting a Good Review,"This was just the type of book I was looking for - one specifically addressing the 10-Minute play, a creature different from any other theatrical endeavor. I found the book easy to understand, well organized and very informative. I think it could have spent a little more time on the mechanics but overall it will be a great help in teaching my theatre arts students how to write 10-Minute plays for class and for the various festivals that now feature them."
5,Very good book,"I don't remember WHY I decided to buy this book, but I'm glad I did. It's one of my favorite robot books. I learned alot about setting up a microprocessor to read and write to RAM, external addressing, and lots of other cool stuff. The project is just so neat, that I'm considering hunting down an 8085 just so that I can build the little robot pet. It responds to voice commands, randomly does ""pet"" things, and plays on it's own. How cute. It even hunts down it's own charger, acts hungry if it can't find it... ! If you're interested in real microprocessors (not a basic stamp) get this book. You'll learn alot from it."
2,Too much information in one book,"I used this book when taking cosmology lectures. Then I already mastered the principles of general relativity and advanced quantum theory. Nevertheless, I found the book still too advanced for self study. For this book to be useful, or to enjoy this book, one should already be very familiar with the subject.Perhaps the book could be useful for reference purposes since it does contain a lot of information. Because everything is so densely packed and not very clearly presented, I found it not useful for a first acquantaince with the subject. And certainly not for beginners. Now, five years later, it is still in my book shelf, but I have never looked into it again. A slight disappointment for me, also because it is not cheap.My advice to those who are doubting, check it out in the library."
5,The Pilgrimage Road To Santiago,"Having walked part of the famous ""Camino "" in September, I was most interested in this book as it detailed so much of what I had seen. Although I had taken lots of notes on the way , I was able to look up all the areas I had visited and explore them once more . It will be one of my ""keepers"" for sure.And I would recomend it to anyone who is starting out on the pilgrimage."
2,Good historical review; poor description of Camino,"If you''re looking for what sounds like a doctorate thesis on the Camino, this is the film for you. I was looking for a physical description of the Camino with examples of refugios, road conditions, etc. What a disappointment! You get four ""lecture-series"" type personalities and and some student pilgrims thrown in. You can find all, if not most, of what is said on the St. James Confraternity web site for free."
5,"A nice, intelligent, low-key, indie rock record","I've been a fan of Brooklyn-based power-popper Frank Bango for many years now, and was mystified by my own muted reaction to this fine album (his third, I believe...) I think it just took a long time to settle into my subconscious; I listened to it several times when it first came out, but couldn't quite formulate an articulate response to the songs. Now, revisiting it a few months later, I find myself as delighted with it as I was with his earlier albums. Bango has a playful sense of wordplay and strong ear for simple melodic hooks, which invite favorable comparisons to Dave Edmunds, Elvis Costello and Graham Parker... He's still ""got it,"" and is crafting some of the nicest, most mature independent pop music out there today. Worth checking out!"
5,Very good Reporting Services book,"I found the book to be an excellent source for getting up to speed on Reporting Services. I found chapters 2 and 9 to be very well written. If you are thinking about moving from Crystal to Reporting Services, I would recommend adding this book to your library."
3,Good start but lacking on advanced report design,"With this book you will be able to set up and run Reporting Services, however, if you are looking for something that details advanced report design (e.g. anything more than simply bound table data) then this is not the book for you. In fact I don't know what would be the book for you. I'm still looking."
1,Big On Errors And Small On Utility,"The architecture overviews are good, but from there on it's full of errors and lacking the detail needed to make it useful. It has what you could loosely call ""excercises"" that I've gone through (step-by-step) and found many errors with. Errors that require many hours of debugging and fixing on the part of the reader. The writing is very cursory, overly broad and not detailed enough to be useful. The book often mentions that something useful CAN be done with Report Services but doesn't explain HOW to do it. Perhaps a revised edition is in order. One with more detail and with walkthroughs that have been followed, tested and confirmed accurate."
3,A Joke in the Hand is Worth Two in the Book,"Although filled with some interesting plots and characterizations I was disappointed by the ""Naked Gun"" type of story telling. I think every character has a ""don't call me Shirley"" moment and it is annoying to say the least. But, I am a huge fan of New Frontiers and anything is better than nothing. Indeed, the scene involving Calhoun in the council chamber is incredible (I'll say no more to avoid spoilage).My overall impression is that this novella was rushed out and doesn't represent the quality we have come to expect from Mr. David. Yet, even in this short, comic stretch it is good to see our New Frontier friends.A side note. The letter to the readers at the beginning was very strange. Essentially, Mr. David lectured the reader that these are his characters and he would do what he pleases with them. That is part of my basis for thinking this was not a novella that was ready for publication. Very strange."
4,"Great fence product, currently $20 at Home Depot or Lowes","The seller of this product is currently listing at $75. I just bought some at Home Depot yesterday in San Diego for $20 (SKU 308376A). Also consider the ""rabbit fence"" version of this product with finer mesh at the bottom, SKU 308376B."
4,It's Brenda's World,"I was happy to see Brenda release a new cd! Most of the songs are mid-tempo with Brenda's still strong voice, 'Don't Keep Runnin'' would've been great for urban radio stations, 'Never Forget Your First', 'No Regrets', 'Easier Said Than Done' are my favorites, although Preston Glass does a great job with the instrumental programming, i hope for the next cd they use real musicians. I think Brenda's long time fans will be happy with this cd."
3,Good if horses like it.,"I buy to try made my horse to be happy, the product are soo fine, but my horse don't show interesting in it."
2,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",NOT EVEN ANGELINA JOLIE CAN SAVE THIS MOVIE. BORING. EDITING IS BAD. WASTED SCENES NEED TO GO. JM
3,A must for Angelina fans,"Ok, I'm being generous with my rating, but only because I loved Angelina's performance in this movie. It is a very low budget, low quality film, but she in mesmerizing. I only recommend that major fans of Angelina like me get this, though, or else you'll be dissapointed. Overall the movie isn't very good, but Angelina's performance is definently worth watching. I'm glad I bought this tape!!!"
3,Without Evidence,The movie was not at all what I expected but I watch the whole thing and eventually I got into it. I was happy that it was in great condition and it arrived in a timely manner. Thanks for the fast delivery and great product.
1,Not worth purchasing; this information is free.,Most - if not all - of the information in this book is available for free online with a quick search.
2,Hacking Windows XP,An advertisement for a myriad of shareware and freeware programs. Everything in the book can be found at serveral web sites for free so why spend 20 dollars like I did.
5,Hacking XP has never been so easy!,"If Bill Gates ever paid attention to what customers actually wanted in their operating system rather than shoving it down our throat, then he would hire Steve Sinchak to write the next version of Windows. Concise, easy to read, and liberating."
3,"Beginner - Intermediate Level ""Hacks""","The good thing about the book is that the steps are easy to follow & most technique's can be applied to most XP editions. It's also good in the fact that it doesn't get into too much theory, it gets straight to the point & shows the 'how to' & 'why to'What I didn't appreciate about the book is that most of these 'hacks' seem like a collection of customizations you can easily learn & find at any site on the net. If you are already scoping around the net for hacks & tweaks to your system & decided maybe this book can 'add more tricks in your book' then you might be in for an unpleasant surprise. At the end, you might even say to yourself ""I could have written this & that chapter"" (Assuming you have an intermediate level of PC knowledge)"
3,its pretty good,"THIS PRODUCT DIDNT ""WOW"" ME SO TO SAY, IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO TELL A DIFFERENCE IN THE AIR QUALITY AND THE HIGH SETTING IS QUITE LOUD. I ALSO PURCHASED A BLUEAIR PURIFIER AND THAT ONE IS WONDERFULL. QUIET AND YOU CAN TELL IT REALLY WORKS WITH 5 ROOM CHANGES AN HOUR."
2,Makes a pitched whine,"This is a completely unusable air filter. The unit, at all speeds, makes a very audible and distracting pitched noise. This is not at all suitable for any environment.The unit moves very, very little air as well."
3,Eh...it works but has its issues,"This air purifier does a good job on improving the air quality, but it's a little loud and the filter is not washable."
2,like a jet engine,"unfortunately, just too noisy. it's barely tolerable on low, then just for short periods. on high it's like a jet engine.[there's no whine, though, as another reviewer noted - just white noise. if it is whining, there's something wrong.)it's a nice compact design that seems to work well, if you have some out of the way room or place to use it where the noise isn't an issue!"
1,The Worst Air Filter - Loud and cheaply made. (No stars),"I have owned this unit for 6 months and I am ready to throw it away. It's noisy and rattles at any speed over the lowest one, which barely moves any air. Do not consider buying this piece of @#%P."
1,Wrong Product! It is a HEPA Type not a True HEPA,"We ordered these filters because the product description stated it was a HEPA filter that would clean up to 110 sq. feet. It also read that the filter would be suitable for a room up to a 110 sq feet. The price was so good we order six to provide adequate coverage in each room for my daughter who suffers from allergies. (I also ordered a Rabbit HEPA filter for downstairs and am absolutely in love with it.)My husband received the packages while I was out of town. When I got home, we had six filters that were HEPA-type filters that only cleaned 95% of the air and were only good for 80 (yes 80) sq. feet. The description also says this is a four cycle filter. There are only two with what I received. None of the six were what was described on amazon."
1,Completely Misleading and FALSE advertising,"I ordered this purifier based on the description given by Amazon. They claimed it was suggested for use in rooms up to 110 sqft, and had the following CADR AHAM numbers Tobacco Smoke: 70 Dust: 60 Pollen: 55. None of these claims are true, I literally received the purifier 10 minutes ago and here are the numbers listed on the box; Suitable for rooms 80sqft, Tobacco Smoke: 53 Dust:44 Pollen: 58. I guess I will see how well it works but I'm incredibly upset that I did not receive what I thought I was buying. It may be a better product than 1 star, but based on what I thought, this purchase was a HUGE disappointment.As other reviews have stated this thing is very loud on high."
1,Rattling noise,"Initially, it wasn't loud for my standards. It was as loud as an AC unit which was fine for us. However, after a month of daily usage, all of a sudden there was this rattling noise especially in the 2 highest settings. I have checked to determine if maybe something came loose inside but when we shake the unit, we hear nothing. The rattling occurs only when the fan is running."
3,efficient but noisy,"Yes, this cleaner is pretty loud, especially at the high setting. We have three, one for each bedroom. On its lowest setting, it adds a low rumble, similar to a fan, for sleeping - good if you work night shift or live in a noisy area. We have three cats and a large dog and for the first time in 11 years, our son has been without an upper respiratory infection. It is affordable and efficient."
2,Needs replacement filters,"Nice small little HEPA Filter. Does a fairly good job of removing allergens. I have one in my bedroom, on the lowest setting it is not very noisey - does not interfere with sleeping. My problem with this unit is the replacement filter. I paid $40 for this, but the replacement filters are $30, and need to be replaced every 3 months - $120 per year in filters. I am going to return this machine and buy a permanent filter machine instead."
3,Noisy but does it's job.,"I had this air filter for about a year, and it worked out okay. I had two problems with it. 1) It's extremely noisy. It shakes and rattles even on the lowest setting. 2) The replacement light NEVER came on. I had a hard time determining when to change it's filter. Overall it worked, but you would probably be better off finding a quieter model."
4,Honeywell,"Well its a little loud. It has 3 setting, the fastest setting is very loud. The lowest setting is about the same as a space heater on medium. It has an ionizer option as well. Also has a check light for reminding to check your filter. Works great just a little loud in my mind"
4,"Seems good, but not for my purposes","Used to help provide ventilation when spraying model paints, it didn't do much. I think it has more to do with its inability to pull in enough air than its inability to filter the air it gets - it did help the room in a period of a few hours. Overall it seems like a good desktop air purifier but it's not going to work for what I needed it for."
3,Effective but LOUD,"I have had and used this machine now for about 3 years, it is effective and does a good job with cleaning the air, but it is LOUD even on low, its to loud for a bedroom to keep it running at night time, so I run it on high during the day and have to shut off the fan at night and only leave the ionizer running. But the price is right for those that can't afford an expensive machine and need something."
4,air cleaner review,"Nice, but I'd hoped it would blow out the front, not the top . . . we use it anyway as make a good white noise and cleans air in bedroom area."
4,Quiet and Efficient,"This Air purifier was much quieter than I had expected. It's done it's job beautifully, keeping the air in my bedroom nice and clean and mostly dust and cat hair free all winter. Which is tough in my apartment!"
3,Decent little units,"These seems to work well for a single room. We had house guests with allergies and picked two up. I do think they are rather loud overall. I doubt it's possible to pay the same amount for a different product and have it be a quieter one. So, pick your poison :). Overall, I'm satisfied, but if I could have afforded it, I'd get a larger/quieter one."
2,loud and green light lights up the room,I have 4 different air cleaners at home and at work and this one is the loudest. The green on light is way too bright and the angle of the tinted plastic makes it hard to cover. I ended up prying up the plastic and putting tape over the light.
3,ahhhhh welll!!!,"This little air purfier works ok when it says small room it means small room i bought this for my son's bedroom and it makes a difference but only on high and with ionizier,but it does makes a difference,noise level sounds like fan on medium but on other levels it doesnt really work well"
3,Pretty Good While It Worked,"We used this little purifier in a single room where we needed some white noise with the benefit of at least slightly cleaner air. It did a good job while it lasted. Unfortunately, I'm writing this review to let people know that we bought this last March and the motor just blew, barely a year later. Maybe I expect too much, but for the price I'd like it to last longer than that. We always kept up on changing the filter so I know it isn't that. I also know that we didn't even use it all the time, so it isn't like it broke from constant use. I have a couple of larger purifiers that have lasted me longer so I'll be sticking with those even though they are louder, if I'm going to spend the money I'd like to keep it around rather than filling the landfill one purifier at a time."
4,Works for a small room,"Great item for a small room. Like others have said, it is noisy. I would not expect to put this in a bedroom, unless on low speed. Filters are readily available and seems to work as advertised. I plan to purchase another one."
1,Extremely noisy!,"There are 3 fan settings on it and the lowest setting is ok as far as noise goes. To get really clean air though, the other 2 settings are ridiculously noisy. I can't hear anyone talking to me or even use my TV unless it's turned up to #45 on volume! It's in my home office where I usually watch TV. After awhile, I start to get a headache due to the fan noise and it causes me to leave the room. I wish I bought something else. Do I want really clean air and can I put up with the noise? hmmm....not sure. UPDATE: After using it 3 more weeks, I've decided I can't put up with the noise (or headaches) any longer! Not worth the postage cost to return it so I'm donating it to Disabled AmVets. I hope someone plugs it in before taking it home. It has no rattles and I know this is the usual sound it makes. Deserves less than 1 star!!!"
4,Nice,"It looks good, and works well for my office space. The highest setting is a little noisy, but it works like white noise and actually helps me to tune out sounds outside my office, so that's a plus.Also, it arrived quickly, which is always great. Very pleased."
1,Derivitive Claptrap,"Nothing much to add - my title says it all. Don't buy this boring, second rate CD. You'll regret it if you do."
4,Good alternative to live class,"A real live class is best, but this cd and booklet works very well as an alternative if you can't get to a real live class."
5,YES!,"I love this CD for what it does for my back. I am much stronger in Cobra,upward bow and camel. I do it once a week on Sunday mornings. OK, so Bryan's asana terminology is offense, i.e. downward doggy, crotch asana, crotch candy. Maybe no one told him that women outside of Los Angeles don't like that stuff and serious yogi like you to refer to the poses by their real english names or better yet sanskrit names. Regardless, I take out it what I need. He doesn't do Bridge pose or Upward Bow, so I add these. After the spinal work, I just float up, which is no easy feat for me since I am a healthy girl. Get this one. Your spine will love you."
4,Good with one exception,"Bought one for my wife and I (both grad students that spend a lot of time in the library and public spaces). It fits fully in my hand to give you a sense of the size. Easily fits both my HP and her Macbook.Pros: Lightweight, very portable, retractable chord, fits easily in my laptop bag.Cons: Cable is pretty thin (think a spaghetti noodle width) that can be cut with sturdy cutters (but really, who carries these around in the library?)Overall, satisfied with the product, feel much safer leaving the laptop now, but understand that it's only one level of security and not the final answer. Having a cable I think helps deter while it gives me a little peace of mind."
4,Review for the Kensington 64053 MicroSaver Retractable Portable Notebook Lock (PC/Mac),"Well there was nothing in the description about how there was some sticky stuff covering the entire black color parts of the device. I was not too happy about having to work for something that I bought. I would have liked it more if in the description it had told me about the issue.I also would have like to know how thick the wire was with the lock, in addition to knowing that it came with one irreplaceable key."
1,cable is tooo thin,Very disappointed with this product. The cable is way too thin. I can cut it in pieces easily. Your computer will not be secured by using this lock. Wasting my money !
1,crap for shipping,I didn't even bother to open the cable because when I opened the box the device had obviously been previously opened and/or used.
4,Kensington 64053 MicroSaver Retractable Portable Notebook Lock (PC/Mac),"Supplier delivered very well, though delayed by Amazon delivery system. Also, got complaint from customer that the product is ""thinner"" than expected, which I do not think takes away from the strength and usefulness of the product. Otherwise should be good."
2,This is a bootleg DVD-R - poor quality video/audio,"There is no mention in the description of this item that this is a DVD-R, *NOT* a properly pressed DVD, and the quality of the video and audio is very poor. I agree that this version of ""1984"" with Peter Cushing and produced by the BBC in 1954 is the best ever produced, with stark performances and the most chilling portrayal of a totalitarian government I've seen. But this DVD is obviously a bootleg import, and for Amazon to be selling it with no mention of its true nature is deceptive at best. There are numerous video artifacts: pixellation in the video as well as innumerable specks, lines, and a constant flickering. This identical release has been duplicated on two other Amazon products: B0025ZIG8Q and B002KECK1G - all of which are of the same poor quality. If you haven't seen this version, it's worth going to YouTube and watching there, but this DVD-R is not worth what they're asking."
4,1984=2010!!!!!,"The edition viewed is the one from PRStudios. Amazon should have noted that this is a DVD-R. This is a great production of a very timely story, although the DVD quality leaves much to be desired. I've seen much better kinescopes than this. 1984 was late coming, but has really picked up the last few months. The novel should be required reading in all schools."
3,For the afficiando,"Follows the book, kind of. The 1984 version with Hurt and Burton is the best representation, but this one isn't bad."
4,Love this!,"I first saw this picture at a neighbor's house, and then again at a friend's house. It only seemed fitting that I get one for my infant son's bathroom, which is decorated blue/brown. it looks great and I'm secretly hoping it'll be motivation for when my son starts potty training :-)The only con I have is the size. It's not the easiest to find a frame for unless you're going to go custom. I ended up buying a see through frame 13x18 and let the remaining glass be the border."
3,"Fun, but....","This game is fun, going around collecting dino's and teaching them moves with DNA. I suggest this for children 10-15. It lacks in interest after you beat the game once (and believe me, will take you less than an hour), even if you are the biggest jurassic park fan on earth. Buy this if it's under $10.00. Just in case your curious, you gain control over (in order) a velociraptor, stegosaurus, tricerotops, pteronodon (which flies away), maybe an ankylosaurus (i'm not sure), a t-rex, and a spinosaurus. I hope this helped!"
3,Dinosaur Batlles: Not what you think,"I got this game for Christmas one year, and thgis is what I have to say. First of, this game is actually another JP game called Scan Command, just released under a different title. Second, there are only 6 dinosaurs you can control, and most of them are very weak (Including Spinosaurus). Third, it has little to do with the storyline of the movies. The game makes you think an ancient tribe of people lived on the island and worshiped the dinosaurs! I'm being completely serious!The last thing is that my computer could show most of the 3D landscape because the computer (brand new, I should mention) wasn't powerful enough!!!! Besides for this, it is a pretty good game, just for those do-nothing days. Buy with caution!!!"
1,Looks good -- but totally worthless.,"This is by far the worst amplified antenna i have ever seen. The UHF loop gets in the way of the VHF dipoles, making it impossible just to set it and leave it alone.For reasons unknown to me, there is a clock that runs off a watch battery in the loop, which doesn't come with the antenna. And didn't work when I installed a battery.This antenna didn't pick up 1/2 the channels my old RCA amped antenna did. And the RCA was 1/2 the price.Stay away from this one."
4,The Accidental Heroes,"Three thorough biographies in alternating chapters, trace the life journies of distinct personalities whose fate converged at a broken-down mission. Not for the hero-worshipper, it is nonetheless reverential of the heroism of its fallible protagonists. The valuable footnotes are as illuminating and informative as the text."
3,glad I read it... but,"This author really did his homework. Such detail. Admit I skipped thru some parts. Guess I could have given a 4 star. Pretty dry when talking of Bowies land schemes, etc. If you want to know how those 3 men ended up at the Alamo and what happened there, get the book. One alsogets a real sense of the early westward expansion of this country and what drove these men to take part. They had motives beside freedom but the author gives them their due on the bravery scale."
4,Minus the Mexican view,I can fully endorse the previous reviews here. This is a wonderful piece of historical writing. The only thing missing to give it full classic status is the lack of the Mexican viewpoint. I wish Davis had included the life of Santa Anna and called it Four Roads.
3,Too Much,Go's way to much in depth as to what they paid for everything. Dollar and cents wise. Who cares. Hard to get into and hard to stay with.
1,Disappointed,"I too was under the impression that the original artists would be singing those 70's songs. NOT SO! Had I been able to listen to a sample song, I never would have bought the CD. Listening to The BB Band made my head hurt. ... I couldn't listen to the rest of the CD. Avoid this CD like the plague!"
1,Not various artists singing,"The songs are sung by the BB Band and not by various artists as one might deduce from the item description. The song list shows original artist names, to be honest I didn't even listen to the entire album it was SO bad in my opinion. I sent it back."
4,wife friendly accessory,Protects cables easy to install makes ordinary cables look like a million dollars. Wife friendly. Fits very thick cables as well as skinny ones.
2,Flimsy paperboard,"I bought these boxes thinking they would be made of cardboard, but in fact, they are thin, clay-coated paperboard. In addition, the tabs you use to hold the boxes in the folded state slip sometimes out of the slots, so your contents spill out."
5,Rainbow Six 3,"This game is great, if you like squad based tactics, this is your game. Well worth the money."
1,Terrible,This game is terrible. The movement is difficult and cumbersome. Your team of elite soldiers are nothing more than bumbling idiots that manage to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They remind me of the Three Stooges as they constantly run back and forth into the line of fire. Mine as well as the terrorists! The missions are very linear and the maps don't allow for any exploration. I had to choose between this game and Ghost Recon Jungle Storm. I made the wrong choice. I would not reccommend this game to anyone.
1,PC Not Ps3,Rainbow Six & Alice were my first PC Games Long before PlayStation way before iPad!(where i can do more damage with one finger than 10 on PC.) I've played pong you work with what you have lol. Anyway Rainbow Six will always be a PC Game.
3,There's better Tom Clancey games.,"This is a pretty good game with pretty good levels, a competitive Al, and ok graphics. A lot of die hard Tom Clancey fans hate this game. I'm not one of them though but I have played my share of them Splinter Cell, etc.... It has a great virety of weapons but your teammates are kind of smart and dumb. They follow orders ok but they make stupid decisions when in combat. There is an extra level in here unlike the XBOX version. The levels are a little short but are very hard. You would have to repeat the levels over and over again which makes it a little boreing. It doesn't even have a thing where you can set the difficulty. It has a very nice multiplayer mode which makes the game very fun for 2 people. The online mode is so-so. Other then that the game plays fine and I never had any serious glithces. For $20.00 you should get this game if your into the shooting genre."
3,Already traded,"I am a big fan of both squad-based cambat, and open-world games. I have been searching for an experiance equal to the Ghost Recon series games for some time. Rainbow six 3 is not it. Absolutely not open-world at all, very linear. As a squad-based tactical shooter, I found it was sub-par. Since you are trapped in tight hallways the whole time, there is little use for the rest of your team, other than when entering a room with multiple doors. Then the ""Frag and Breech"" commands are fairly interesting. But for the most-part, you are ducking and shooting around corners. I got bored with that pretty quickly. For squad-based shooters; go with Ghost Recon. For open-world, go with Mercenaries.I played R 6 3 for a few nights before trading it in at Gamestop."
5,"THE NEW YEAR, 2004, IS FINALLY HERE!!!","I have my new Wiggles 2004 Calander hung up and it has all the Wiggles & friends in it, only this time, they're live images now. Jeff is on January, Dorothy the Dinosaur is on February, All four of the Wiggles are on March, Greg is on April and so on. The pictures are just so fancy and I'll always have love for the Wiggles, it's strong and powerful...even for my favorite Wiggle, Greg."
2,Incomplete curriculum,"I have heard that this is a great small group or individual group bible study. I was very excited to get it because it was hard to find. However, No where did I see in the discription that it needs a video to go with it to make it complete. Basically, the book is worthless without the video. I would think the video would be included with it. Very disappointed!"
5,"Poetry that is spare, sharp, and unfailingly wise.","""Dreams are commercials, too./But we don't know what they are pleading for."" Vladimir Levchev, a renowned poet, novelist and editor in his native Bulgaria, proves his mastery of his adopted language in ""Heavenly Balkans,"" an uncommonly astute and striking chapbook of poems. As an Eastern European poet, Levchev had to learn much more quickly about the reality of history and politics than American poets do, and he demonstrates this in such poems as ""The Balkan Dance"": ""We are dancing towards a new millennium/and all we can see in our future/is our past."" But he also writes perceptively of America in such poems as ""Washington, D.C.,"" in which he observes that ""Freedom has countless swaying faces,"" and in ""No Man is an Island,"" observing that ""We all live in Manhattan"" in the aftermath of 9/11. This is a small book--only 40 pages--but the poetry in it is big."
1,DO NOT USE THIS!,"I used this on my dog. She of course started to try to rub it off. I didn't think much of it then. A day later she looked miserable, didn't want to eat her food or go to bed at night, which she usually goes to without hesitation. She looked afraid and wanted to be next to us. The next day, she started walking funny. Her butt would be to the side when she was walking. I immediately read reviews on internet. Horrible reviews. Most of them are of 2009 so maybe it has become less toxic since then, I don't know. She didn't take it as bad as other dogs, but she might have if I let it stay on her for longer. After reading the reviews we gave her a bath. I read other people have given tuna fish to their dogs and this helped with their symptoms, but I don't know how or why it helped. We didn't have any tuna at home so I haven't given it to her. She looks much better now. He walking has straightened almost completely. I would never buy this again."
5,Sensible eating for lifelong weight management,"This book puts together all the research on how to successfully manage your weight--- starting with no ""diet."" Instead it's about eating sensibly, enjoying what you are eating, and expanding your food repertoire to include more fruits, veggies, and whole grain fiber. I especially loved the ""Body Score"", a checklist of items to give you a score every day or week on how you are doing. Sure, you might have had a bad day and gotten a low score--- so try to bump up your score the next day. The book makes it clear that weight management isn't a zero-sum game of win or lose, it is about making small improvements and moving on from the inevitable mistakes."
5,I bought this book for all of my friends for Christmas,I learned so many things from this book that I had to share it with all of my friends. My doctor prescribed this book.
3,lacking info.,"There are several things missing, which would have made this book much more useful for me.1. A shopping list for the weekly menus.2. A total calorie count or range for the days menus. You have to check each recipe, and/or go to another source.3. A carb and/or sugar count. They count protein, fat, fiber and calories.4. A glycemic index number for each recipe. They talk about it, but don't include it.I am a diabetic, currently managing my blood sugar through diet. This info is important to me.Bought used, through Amazon Marketplace."
2,Hard to read,"I didn't get very far in this book. It is very technical, has a lot of information, which I'm sure is good, but when I looked at the menus and food suggestions, I was very disappointed. The recipes and menus are very detailed and time consuming. There is no way someone can do this without a lot of prep time, which I do not have. Maybe it's because I'm in the Midwest, but many of the ingredients are not even readily available."
1,What a waste,"The 9 point plan is full of obvious things we already knew. The 21 day plan means you have to cook every meal every day, and each meal has 4-6 items to make for it. the rest of the book is filler.I can't believe I bought into the hype and wasted my cash on this thing."
5,A Research-Based Diet and Eating Plan That Really Works!,"As a public health researcher, I am always interested in what Dr. Walter Willett has to say about diet and healthy eating. His recommendations are based on research, not on fad or fashion. Now, teamed with Mollie Katzen of ""Moosewood"" fame, Willett has created a workable plan for helping Americans not only lose weight, but eat a healthier diet. My husband and I have tried out the 21-day plan for the last 3 weeks, and we are losing weight and we are not starving in the least! The recipes are excellent, most of them taking only a short time to prepare. One has to be committed to stick with this eating plan, but the results are very worthwhile. Congratulations to Willett and to Katzen for a job well done!"
2,Nothign New Here,"This Album is very bland . This Band on a whole tends to be very repetitive and it gets old very fast. I'm sure If your into a few "" F--- you I'm punk "" slogans then you'll love this band . Pure Fashion Punk with slow drum beats . I'm Sure the some of the "" Punx"" will love it for its run down rebelliousness"
1,Absolute S HIT,This album was absolutly terrible. Is rather be sodimised by Rosie Odonell than listen to this cd. I recomend suicide to anyone you actually enjoys this album.
1,Sad,"After many great masterpieces, this one is far too slow. The voices are great as usual but it sounds like great voices singing bad songs with a kareoke background."
1,Not Representative Of An R&B Legend,"When I purchased this CD I had hoped I was getting some new music from one of my favorite groups (note: DO NOT pass up an opportunity to see The Dramatics live!). But a closer look at the linear notes reveal that only two Dramatics performed on the CD, RJ Reynolds and Ron Banks. I belive this CD is the heretofore unreleased ""Two Of A Kind"" project that RJ and Ron were working on. So if you, like me, are waiting for the next Dramatics project..the wait continues."
3,talent wasted,this dynamic group talent was wasted.the songs on this album dont accomadate the talent of this great group.this is the first album i would not buy.disgusted fan wasted talent
2,"I love this group, but the album is not their best effort.","There is no group or singer in the world that I love more than the Dramatics. None! I have almost all of their albums and CDs, including LJ (It's LJ, not RJ!) Reynolds' solo projects, and I'm still looking for more. But this album is awful! With the exception of a couple of songs, it's just too slow, syrupy, and sappy. It is good music to fall asleep to, though."
3,Doesn't measure up to the original Top Chef.,"I LOVE Top Chef. I have faithfully watched every season since it began. It's my fave reality show ever. Just Desserts is a good concept, since you get to see great sugary creations which have always eluded the traditional chefs. However, while the judging panel is wonderful, the contestants seem to have an exceptional knack for not being able to deal with the pressure. I don't know how they chose these contestants but when the drama centers around crying and not being able to do the tasks without flipping out (in the very beginning of the season) something is wrong. It just doesn't feel like a 'best of the best' pasty chef competition because of that. I'm sure they are talented but I hope if they do this season again all of the contestants will be well prepared for competition. I really could only recommend watching this while all other Top Chef versions are on hiatus. (I still love you top chef! sorry!)"
4,A nice twist to Top Chef,"Frankly I don't agree with the reviews below. I thought TCJD was a nice twist to Top Chef as the dessert and pastry world isn't covered well in the Top Chef series. Yes, there are some quirky personalities, some rivalries and tensions between some of the chefs, but after a few episodes you begin to appreciate the desserts and chefs characters a bit more and the drama becomes a side note. I think Season 1 is always a difficult one because it's trial and error. I found the conclusion frustrating only because I was sure of the winner and it wasn't whom I felt deserved the title, but often that's how it goes. The drama between chefs is going to always be a factor in all the Top Chef series, but if you can deal with a little drama, (frankly, I think I cheered out loud when one crazy chef had an unexpected early departure from the show)... overall TCJD is a fun ride!"
1,Lots of conflict a la MTV. An embarrassment for Bravo.,"We are fans of the Top Chef series but this competition was very hard to watch. There was too much conflict, poor behavior, vile language and overall disappointing cooking. I watched with my children and I was really ashamed of the contestants as an adult. Thumbs down and definitely not a keeper. Shame on you Bravo for putting this out!"
3,like watching a sitcom,"Drama, drama, drama! Unlike regular Top Chef, this show seems more about the arguments playing out than the actual baking. The challenges and the desserts are interesting, but some of the professionalism seems lost.*Watch the second season! The challenges are tougher, the results are amazing, and there is not as much bickering. Highly recommend!"
2,First you need to get your child to listen.,"This didn't help at all, my 6 year old thought the stories were boring. The hard part is getting them to lay and listen when wound up."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I have mixed feelings about this CD. My kids were used to Annie de narrator from The Indigo Dreams, garden of wellness CD, that when they heard this CD they asked me to ""go back to Annie"". My 6 year who has some minor sensory issues, is scared by the voice of the narrator....he complains that the music scares him too.My 4 year old daughter doesn't mind but prefers her friend Annie.I want it to buy more of these CDs but i want to make sure, this time, that I get something my kids feels confortable with. Is there any other CDs where the narrator is the same as the one in the Graden of wellness CD?"
4,Good but smelly,This product is great but when it arrived the packaging and the CD smelled like cigarette smoke. Otherwise the CD is good and it arrived quickly.
5,Good choice,Thoroughly enjoy listening to this cd w my daughter . The imagery is excellent and the narrator's voice is quite soothing. Very happy w purchase.
5,Finally! A full night's sleep with no tears!!!!,"My son was having all kinds of anxiety about sleeping in his own bed and even when he did sleep there he would get up in the middle of the night and play video games. It's a bit upsetting to find your 4 year old up at 2 AM on the computer afraid to go to sleep. He was afraid of the dreams he might have. Anyway, this CD has calmed his anxiety. We put it on and have the CD repeat all night. He is asleep within 10 min. and doesn't get out of bed till morning."
5,Relax with children,"I am a school psychologist and use this CD in my ""worry classes"". I use it with children who are experiencing anxiety as well as for children on the autism spectrum. The children ask and look forward to using it as a part of each session. Through the easy to follow stories, the children have learned relaxation techniques which they have carried over to home and bed time. they always leave the sessions calmer and ready to go back to class for learning. Some of the children have had their parents buy the CD for them. I would highly recommend this series for children who are experiencing anxiety but also just for healthy relaxation."
2,Tone Not Right,"For my child, who has had sleep issues forever, and had alot of success with Indigo Dream: Garden of Wellness, this CD was disappointing. The stories and music were great....but for my child, the tone of the narrator did not create a calm feeling for her. She responded to the voice of the ""Garden of Wellness"" CD much better."
5,Soothing and relaxing for little ones,"I love these cd's. I got this for my 5yr old because he is highly sensitive. After the daily stresses of (to him) loud noise, ugly smells, crowed class rooms, this cd helped him make it through kindergarden. And now he's enjoying first grade. I don't know what I would of done without Indigo Dreams."
4,Nice Calm bedtime meditation,"10 year old daughter loves this cd, my 5 year old son yells no I don't want it. Speaker tells stories with key words such as ""calm"" ""happy"" ""beautiful"" ""smart"" she speaks slowly and calmly - I personally find it relaxing and I could fall asleep to it."
3,This is interesting.,"I like this cd. My 4 year old doesn't really care for it anymore. She listened to it a few times when she was an older 3 or young 4 year old, but I think that she really prefers me to read her a book over listening to cd's before bedtime.I can see how it can relax a person; worked for me. At one point, while I was listening to this, I was in a deep, deep relaxation, then about to doze off and then there was a loud yawn that didn't match the others in volume and that made me jump."
3,Indigo Dreams,"Not quite what we needed for our nine year old. I purchased this in hopes it would help with her ADHD problems, will keep looking and trying."
4,Nice stories to fall asleep to,My son enjoys listening to this cd at night. If he wakes up after a nightmare we turn it back on in the middle of the night so he can relax and fall back asleep. I would reccommend this product to anybody with a small child that has trouble relaxing at night and falling asleep quickly. I have noticed a big difference in the amount of time it takes for him to fall asleep.
5,Great CD for bedtime,"My 4 1/2 year old loves to listen to this CD at bedtime. We thought that he would be too young to appreciate it, but he asks for it every night at bedtime. He really enjoys the stories and we love the fact that it helps him get to sleep and promotes his self worth!!I would highly recommend this CD to any parent."
5,sleep magic!,"My four year old chooses between the 'blue' and the 'purple' cd to listen to as he falls asleep,(purple usually wins!) these have even outdone the Polar Express he had been listening to!calming and soothing- I'm not sure who loves them more- he or I!!!!"
5,Great,My daughter (8) loves these stories. We bought the other 2 CDs as well. She really enjoys them.
1,Waste of money,"My son has a lot of anxiety at night and has trouble falling asleep. The narrator's voice was creepy and weird and the sound quality was not very good--a lot of echo. One of the first stories is about a spider and a snake...not exactly comforting, cute images for a child trying to fall asleep and afraid. I'm surprised at the number of good reviews this got, but to each his own. If it helps, great, but it had the opposite effect on my son. As an adult, I found nothing soothing about the narrator's voice, either. Any message of affirmation she was trying to convey was lost in the delivery. Instead, we're going to try a CD of classical music with birds in the background. Much more sweet, calming, soothing, and lovely to sleep to."
3,Sweet Melody,"The narrator for the stories has a pleasant voice and does a great job making the characters in the story come alive without over doing it. Her voice is like warm nectar dripping, smooth and steady. It completely envelops you in a web of comfort.The pace is slower than I normally keep and when we first began listening to the stories it took a couple of tries before my 8 year old would settle. Now, by the time we are on the second story he's usually asleep.The only reason I don't give it a higher rating is that there are only 4 short stories on the CD and I'm not sure they will pacify my son much longer as he thinks they are baby stories. There are 5 tracks, but 4 stories that are very short. Maybe if there were a variety of more content included, it would work better for us."
5,Perfect Relaxation CD for Kids,"I highly recommend this cd to all parents. My 11 y/o daughter has been listening to this cd, as well as Garden of Wellness and Ocean Dreams. After a busy day, she really needs a cd that is calming and relaxing. This is perfect for that. She will also tell you, that she really enjoys the cds. If I do not have her ""cd"" ready at bedtime, she will make sure to ask! Once again, I recommend all the cds in this series."
3,For certain kids.,"My 7 year old daughter really disliked this cd. She felt it was geared towards a younger child, and was quite bored throughout the first three stories we listened together. I finally allowed her to turn it off. I can see how some kids might enjoy this type of thing, but it was just too fantastical and dreary for both of us."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I purchased this cd for my four year old a few months ago and disliked it enough to bother to write my first review of anything i've ever ordered through the internet. ""Bedtime stories"" is a misnomer. There is no story content. After the first few lines read by the narrator, I found that her unnaturally slow, moronic verse didn't have a relaxing or somnulent effect but did, ironically, irritate me. I sat quietly listenting to the cd until my daughter asked me to turn it off-- only a few minutes into the cd. I skipped through the cd to see if it got better-- it did not. I suppose the point is to bore the child to sleep, but neither I nor my daughter could bear to listen to the ""stories."" This was the first item that I've ever puchased on-line for which i felt truly RIPPED-OFF."
2,disappointing,"My boys are 4 & 6 and this CD does NOT work for them. The stories are spaced too far apart and the boys get anxious waiting. I also tried the books and we found them to be lacking something. I will go back to my own guided relaxation, until I find something better for us. Good luck trying this one."
2,disapointed,"To be fair, my son and I only listened to this DVD once, but neither of us has any desire to listen to it again. I thought it would help my three and a half year old son to go to sleep by himself and also help him learn relaxation techniques. I found the voice of the woman narrating the DVD creepy and surmise that my son felt the same because even though I was lying next to him in bed, he got out of bed and decided he didn't want to go to sleep yet. I couldn't blame him."
2,Too juvenile for my needs,I purchased this CD for my 12 year old. The speaker's rhythm and tone are better suited for a younger audience. Perhaps if I had found this CD when he was 7 years old it would have worked.
4,A nice cd,"My kids and I have listened to this, and it's very relaxing. My 4-yr-old son and 8-yr-old daughter have both been fairly wiggle-free during listening. It's a nice wind-down at the end of the day. Sometimes the speaker seems a little too slow-talking for me, but when I just relax and calm down, it doesn't bug me as much. I very much enjoy relaxation and visualization techniques, and am happy to pass along the benefits to my kids."
4,stamp,"just as described, small compact, multiple uses. You only get to choose one word to put on this stamp though, not easy to change headings."
3,Not ready for prime time,"...This program has many errors in the practice exercises and a few in the examples worked through in the instructional portions of the program. For instance, X^2 + 8X + 16 = (X+8)^2. The program is riddled with such errors which should have been caught by any high school graduate if it was proof-read. Because I am using this program for review, I am able to get through the mistakes but I'm afraid it would confuse someone new to algebra immensely.Because of poor program design, you can't prove the test errors out - it never tells you which test problems you missed so you can't review areas where you may be weak. The interface is not a Windows interface. It only operates full screen so you can't work casually, while doing anything else.Overall, for my purposes, the program is marginally acceptable but I wish I had spent my money on a different math program."
2,"Cheap -- price, quality, service","Cheap price, Cheap quality, and Cheap service.I bought this monitor from a local chain store for its low price and rebate. The first one has a problem of violent image shaking during computer startup. The second one is sharp on the left half, and blurry on the right half screen, which I did not noticed until I ran a screen test pattern. The third one is good so far. Forget the rebate -- you will never get it."
1,"Very disappointing, flickers, dim when adjusting control","The only good things about this monitor are the price and the look. It is very sleek looking at super light. But that's where the benefits end. It is dim even when adjusting brightness (at a certain brightness, it noticably flickers). Very unimpressive display. Not worth it. Go with Cornea or Princeton"
2,Not as good as it looks,"I bought this antenna because the one with my HDTV PCI card, which looks after this one, works very well. I can use that antenna to pick up signals for two computers' HDTV cards and one HDTV, however this one cannot pickup weak signals and it falled apart tonight when I tried to hook it up to my HDTV. I should have returned it to amazon."
1,Richard,Don't waste your money - this UHF indoor antenna did not give me any better reception than my $4.99 Radio shack antenna - plus unlike the Radio Shack this antenna has no adjustments. Of the four major local channels this antenna got poor reception on all four channels - The $4.99 Radio Shack rabbit ears got three of the four channels. Summary - don't buy it.
2,Disappointing,"I have this hooked up to a directv HD reciever. While I pick up multiple HD channels, they jump in and out of reception so much that it is impossible to watch anything. When it is picking up the reception, the picture is awesome. Maybe I just live somewhere with something interfering with my reception. But I don't live in the middle of nowhere, I live in the Chicago suburbs and should have good reception.Maybe I need to search on how to tweak it, but just moving the antenna around doesn't seem to be doing much to help it."
3,Not worth buying if you have cable,"If you have any cable system at all this antenna does not help. Originally I saw reviews where I would be able to pick up lots of HD channels and it does but only your local channels. I have cable but only the basic antenna cable which, essentially means the same as what this antenna would do. So I thought I would save my $12. a month and just use the antenna. However, with my basic cable setting on my new HDTV, I end up picking up over 60 channels - many are duplicates because of the various HD formats however, I pick up at least 10 new ones and all the music channels."
5,"What can I say, it works","I, like many I think, thought well, for this low of a price even if it doesn't work, I'm not out much. However, turns out the thing works like a charm. The antenna is indeed a little flimsy but since I'm not planning on holding up my TV with it I guess it really doesn't matter. It currently sits behind my TV on the TV stand so it's out of the way of little hands. I played with orienting the antenna horizontally or vertically, but didn't see much of a difference."
2,Nice...but not in Chicago,"Product is very lightweight, and, as indicated in other reviews, will be prone to damage if not properly located.I live 20 miles west of Chicago and some channels came in, others sometimes, one (CBS) never. In my research, I found only one review to indicate that CBS would be an issue and it turned out to be accurate.I had combined the antenna with the Samsung HD tuner and it all worked out of the package without too much fuss. But having to go back to moving the antenna to different locations remineded me too much of my childhood so we went to DishNetwork w/ an HD DVR. Wife did not enjoy looking at the antenna either.Honestly, you'll read reviews that indicate that terrestrial HD is the best (better than cable or sat) but I couldnt tell the difference...I say the terrestrial setup is best for those who have one tv, high rise apt dwellers or have an existing outdoor or in-attic antenna that is wired throughout the house."
2,Better alternatives for the same price!,"According to Antennaweb, I live about 20 miles from the transmitters, here ourside Boston. I got the Silver Sensor antenna to go with the DVICO Gold-T tuner card for my PC. Of the 7 or 8 stations I ought to be able to pick up, I could only get 4. I live in a two-story house and couldn't get consistent reception anywhere; the signal strength would flake in and out. The I read about a cheap UHF antenna (model 15-2160) at RadioShack and gave it a try. I can now get all 8 stations without fiddling with the direction and all that. It seems like you either love or hate this antenna. For the same $20, buy an antenna that will not disappoint."
4,Little delicate,The antennae works great. My first order was damaged and got it replaced by amazon. The end of the antenna that sits on the stand is very delicate and if this breaks the connection gets cut off. Should be very careful.I didnt realize that any other Indoor UHF / VHF antenna was CAPABLE of receiving HDTV chanels. My old RCA antenna I bought from Target 2 years back works and receives the same number of HD channels.
2,Check to see if you can pick up HDTV in your area,"I think this item would work fine if I was a little closer to the brodcast area. I have picked up several HDTV programs and they have looked great, however they are few and far between for the lack of HDTV brodcasting in my area at this time!"
2,Broken before used,"Assembly of the unit was easy. The antenna attaches to the top of the arm that stems from the base of the unit. The top of the arm is tapered so that the antenna is held in place force.Before I started using the product I wanted to change the angle of the antenna. This required me to remove the antenna from the top of the arm, and reinsert after rotating the antenna 90 degrees. Unfortunately, the antenna was stuck inside of the top of the arm, and the solder inside the antenna broke before the plastic handle released.So if you decide to adjust the angle of the antenna from the base, BE GENTLE! I have yet to test the reception of the unit. If I can repair it, then I'll update this post."
2,Get a powered HD antenna for much better quality.,"I live about 30 miles from Boston and 50 miles from providence, I bought this antenna to attempt to get a signal. I tested it and it does not compare to the cheap powered antenna I picked up. It was an RCA 50dbi antenna for less than 20$ and it out performs virtually every other antenna I have seen. On top of that its FM / AM / Scanner / CB reception is unbeatable."
1,Don't buy,"I bought this product because I read rave reviews about it. However, it does not work in San Jose (and I live on a top floor). After being able to pick up zero channels, I bought an RCA ANT401 (for the same price) and was able to get all the channels."
1,Poorly Built Device,"Just to be fair, this device had good reception for HD Channels since I lived in the city. It was just poorly constructed that after 1 week of using it, while I needed to adjust the angle of the antenna, It just broke of from the cable it was attached. It was not soldered well I guess. It just went straight to the garbage & I just bought a Terk which was way more sturdier than this."
2,Probably Location,"I was hoping this product would allow me to receive local HD channels. Unfortunately, it was not up to the task. I am not sure if it is the product or my location (40 miles from Baltimore), but I could only receive a couple of local HD channels sporadically."
3,Great for UHF HD - NOT VHF - Be Careful !!,"I bought the PHDTV1 (same thing I believe) and could not get 2 local HD channels. I found out they were VHF (NBC and CBS in Cleveland, Ohio). This antenna couldn't pick-up these HD channels - it's a UHF antenna only. Be careful and do your homework. I had to return this and get the Terk HDTVi which works great for me! The Terk is UHF AND VHF capable.Good Luck,Turbo Tony"
4,"A little flimsy, but.....","Beware this is a very flimsy antenna. If you drop it, it will break. But otherwise, I still think this is the best antenna for the price on the market right now. If it were sturdier, I would give it a 5 rating."
4,The best that I found so far,"I should tried this antenna after reading all the positive reviews instead of getting terk tv55 $100 antenna. Just b/c I think outdoor antenna is better and the more expensive antenna it would work better. Zenith looks simple and it worked!!!! I got all the HD channels in my area. I put the antenna on my 2nd floor next to the window. My area has real bad reception, my analog channels, most of time, they are snowing, I used to have to pay the basic cable just to get local channesl. But with the new 53"" hdtv and this awsome antenna, I recieved all the HD local channnels crystal clear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,better than nothing,"I live in queens, NY. been using this antenna for 3 months now.Pros:6-8 Extra channels, great quality, easy to setup, price.cons:looks bad in the leaving room, when people move in the room they break the signal."
1,Overly fragile,"The jack snapped off the antenna during assembly, rendering the whole thing useless. Cheaper is not always better I guess. If anyone has a suggestion for a HDTV antenna that won't fall apart in your hands, I'm all ears."
2,only worked for some channels,"I bought this product because I saw how welll it worked for a friend. At my house, however, regardless of how I positioned the antenna or where I moved the tv, I could not get good reception on more than one local channel."
2,not as good as I expected,"I found this antena because the review of this antenna is so good on Amazon's website and it's not expensive. But I compared this with my old crappy antenna (10 years old, $5) with one pole broken. My old crappy antenna(supposed to receive the regular air programs, not High Definition TV) performs better than this one! So I suggest you use your current antenna first, if it works just fine, you don't need to buy this one :) It's not as good as you expected."
2,Excellent Reception+Junky Build Qualty,"I got it in the morning and have to return it in the evening. The reception is pretty good- better than the two amplified things I've had and it seems to takes less space....and a power outlet.BUT, it broke off... when i tried to detatch and change the oriantation ... The conecting part protecting the wires was so weak and untight that I think the designer must be joking by doing this!!!If you want to know how a poor build quality can ruin a excellent idea ... buy it!"
5,Best of all I tried,"Most recently I was using a Radio Shack amplified antenna that needed to be tuned for each channel I was watching, which was a pain in the rear but my only hope to get a useable picture.Based on the recommendations here I decided to try this antenna.Well, it is far superior, and needs no tuning when I flip channels.The difference is simply astonishing, highly recommended!"
1,Very disappointed,I oreder Nov 27th it did not arrive until the 23rd. I ordered a Zenith I recieived a phillip. This was my 1st and last order from Amazon!!!
2,Cheap,"Based on my previous experiences with ""rabbit ears"", I was not able to get satisfactory reception on most local commercial stations. It is inexpensive, but also cheaply made. The wire connector to the antenna breaks easily, rendering it useless.We did end up using the metal part of the antenna as a Christmas decoration (looks like a Christmas tree) after it broke off."
4,Good Buy,"The HD reception is incredible. The only issue I have had is the reception fading as you walk past the atenna or open the door in front of it. This mostly has to do with placement and the limited space I have for standing the antenna. GOOD PRICE, GREAT PICTURE."
5,Believe the hype,"I was a bit dubious, but given the cost of digital cable in NYC, I decided to give this antenna a shot (pairing it with Radio Shack's $90 Accurian 16-3499 HDTV receiver). I do have clear line of sight from my eighth floor apartment to the Empire State Building, but given the dodgy radio reception I get, I was not expecting such strong performance from an indoor antenna. Once I saw the signal strength across all channels, I even decided to ""hide"" the antenna by placing it inside a cabinet along an interior wall. Spread the word. Broadcast HDTV is far different than the days of jiggling rabbit ears."
3,Not that good in the city.,"This antenna does not seem to perform that well if there are obstructions between you and the transmitter, so in city it is rather useless on its own.Perhaps those who had good results have a clear line-of-sight to the transmitter and/or are using an amplifier."
3,Not better than the TERK.,"I was hoping this antenna to get better reception than the terk, but it did not. I live in south florida, maybe somewhere else is better but not in the West Palm Beach area."
2,"Poorly built, not all it's cracked up to be","I set up this antenna and the reception wasn't much better than the bow-tie loop that came with the TV. I moved it to a new location and noticed that the nut holding the RF connector on was loose. I tightened it and the connector turned around in the plastic. Since the plastic was also loose, I looked under it and found the wires wern't attached to the connector. I also noticed the connections between the elements and the strip inside is just a press fit - not likely to last long in florida where the salt air and humidity tends to corrode electrical connections. A while later I had soldered a new connector on and set the antenna back up and got slightly better reception than the bow-tie loop. Poorly built and just barely worth the effort. Don't buy it if you don't know how to repair things or solder wires."
2,Vulnerable to easy damage,"I purchased this product based on alot of positive reviews. Unfortunately, I got only 2 or 3 digital channels no matter how I move the antenna in different directions. Finally, when I try to remove the cable, the whole assembly fallen apart and in turn I cannot even use the product same day when I got the product. So, finally I have return the product."
1,No HD channel pick up,"Not strong enough. Found one at Walmart that picked up 16, and this one didn't pick up any. Found out after the fact that it is only 6 dB. I have returned this."
3,It works,It works in my room. but i guess the best way to get the digital channel is using the antenna on your chime. HDTV antenna is just a marketing terms.
1,Not helpful,"I would basically describe this as a contraption. It worked a bit, but not as well as a standard set of rabbit ears."
1,Didn't work for me,"This antenna did not work for me (in Fairfax county, Virginia). It picked up 6 analog channels and ZERO digital channels - I tried positioning it in different angles. I went to the local Best Buy and got a Terk TV5 antenna. It picked up about 18 analog channels and 12 digital channels immediately - no pointing required. I am sorry I did not spend the extra money in the first place, but you don't have to be."
2,It did not work for me,"Despite many other positive reviews, it did not work for my location near the Redondo Beach pier."
4,good,"Works as advertised. The best part is that I like how easy it is to adjust the antenna position vs old rabbit ear antennas. The reason it only got 4 stars is because for certain channels, I have to adjust the antenna position to get reception. I'd give this 4 and half stars if I could."
5,Amazing Antenna,"I was going to have DirectTV install an over the air antenna for me the following day. But I heard about this antenna on a forum site and decided to see what it cost. I was amazed when I saw over 50 positive reviews and decided to give it a try.It took about 5 minutes to install and I was watching all available HD content in my area. I was floored by the picture clearity and quality.This item is awesome, give it a try before you install an outdoor antenna. I think you will be as amazed as I was."
1,Didn't work for me,"I live within 16-20 miles of the local towers and this did not work for me. Only able to get about 20% signal strength on a few channels. Buy from someplace local were you do not have to pay return shipping, like at Amazon, to return it."
5,HD Dream,"I love this little antenna! I bought a much more expensive outdoor antenna from Philips, and I moved it all around my roof looking for signal and found none. The Zenith indoor antenna picks up all my locals in HD with four to six bars on my receiver. I eventually strung coax outside and have this antenna on the corner of my roof- you hardly know it's there and it is working great. We've had very cold weather, two snow storms, and the most rain in a month (Seattle November), and this little champ keeps working like the energizer bunny. I highly recommend this item for either indoor or outdoor use. Also, other reviewers complain it is too flimsy- well it's not made of iron, but I've dropped it a few times moving it around it didn't break. I suppose if I stepped on it then it would break, and if I did I would not hesitate to purchase another..."
5,Amazing! SF BAY AREA,"I'm about 40 Miles from the Sutro Tower, which houses all of the HDTV Signals in the Bay Area, I am able to recive CBS, ABC, UPN, FOX, And PBS In HDTV.. I Recive about another dozen od Digital Signals. I'm in Petaluma which is north of the Tower and I must say im suprized i get any signal at all let alone what I have got."
2,Did not deliver,"I was hoping to use this antenna to receive some channels that I can't get by Cable but while I did pick up local channels, the quality was too poor to be interesting."
4,great reception from a small unit,"This antenna is easy to setup and provides good reception for such a small unit. One nice feature is that it is not powered, so you do not have to place it near a power outlet. It provides good reception, not perfect but good."
2,"Works well, but very fragile design","This antenna is compact and works well. However, beware the fragile connection to the coax cable connector at the back of the unit.The instructions say that you can orient the antenna from vertical to horizontal orientation. However, they don't tell you that each time you do that, you are stressing the very fragile and flimsy connection to the rear connector. I think the antenna should be redesigned so that you can safely orient the antennna from horizontal to vertical without breaking the wire connections."
2,Didn't work for me,"I live in Bethesda, MD about one mile from most of the broadcast towers. I tried this item and about four other antennas and found that I got better reception from the more traditional indoor loop antennas."
1,Disappointed,"This Zenith product does not work any better than my old indoor antenna. Acceptable for UHF channels but useless for VHF channels, 2 to 13."
3,Got couple of HD channels but expected more....,Got couple of HD channels here in the Plano (Dallas) area but expected much more from the rave reviews I saw on this board. I guess it depends on where you live. I would appreciate if any DFW area resident who has this antena can share their experience using this. Form me it's just OK as I get 2 HD channels and none of them are 1080i. But the fact it that it got few channels.
4,Almost Great!,"After using this antenna for a while and reading other reviews, I realized that the thing it's missing is amplification. It picks up the signals good, but just not into the strength my TV deserves. I only live about 15 miles from the transmitting towers, so I should get excellent reception...I don't and it's because the antenna does not amplify the signal.The fact that it's not omni-directional is a minus, but for the price, it's a really good deal...it's just not a GREAT deal."
1,Not for Rural America,"I purchased this antenna to go with my Samsung HDTV DirecTV receiver. I already had a Phillips Magnovox self amplified antenna but according to certain websites I would need a directional UHF antenna for the best reception and to reject multipath signals. However, the answer was not with this antenna, it simply could not pick up what my existing antenna was already able to receive. My distance from signal is about 30 miles for local programming and with what I have read the effective range is up to 15-20 miles at best. (Looks like an outdoor antenna will have to go up this spring.)"
2,Good coverage but very flimsy,"The unit worked well on UHF for the price but broke soon after I purchased it. The coax connector broke away when I turned from horizonal to vertical allignment. Has to resolder the connection back on. If you purchase this item, then handle with care because it is very fragile."
5,This little beauty delivers,"Was a little skeptical of the low price point, but this little guy does the trick. I ended up mounting this one on my rooftop and it gets nearly every channel I want in HD. I say 'nearly' as at least one of the channels (CBS) is hit and miss. Watched a lot of College Football over the weekend in HD..very happy with it.BTW, yes it is a little fragile, so get over it. Just don't drop the thing while mounting it. We will see how it holds up outdoors for me."
3,Not better than my old RCA antenna from the mid 1990s,"I have an old powered RCA antenna from the mid 1990s, and it picks up almost all the HDTV signals in my San Jose, CA area quite consistently. But I thought maybe this Zenith Silver Sensor antenna, with is many many positive reviews, would be better--at least slightly. Well, it was not better. Its performance was about equivalent to my old RCA. I didn't pick up any more channels, and it seemed to be highly directional, whereas my old RCA was not directional at all. So I returned Zenith. Too bad. It goes to show that there are probably other fine HDTV antennas out there, whether the antenna was designed supposedly for HDTV or not."
2,"Fair Signal, Poor Manufacturing Quality","Look for a directional antenna from a different manufacturer.With this antenna, I was able to get 2 extra HD channels compared to an omnidirectional antenna with no gain in Atlanta Metro.Unfortunately, for all of the channels, I had to move the antenna into different directions to actually be able to watch any of them. I did not have to do that with an omnidirectional antenna.After 6 month of use, it stopped functioning normally and I discovered that cables within the antenna were not isolated properly. This product has a very poor manufacturing quality."
2,Broke in less than a month,"Decent reception most of the time, but it looks very flimsly out of the box, didn't have a very high WAF, and the solder joint connecting the Coax to the antenna broke within a month of getting the thing. Consider spending a bit more on a more substantial antenna."
3,"GOOD RECEPTION, BUT HAS FLAW.","The antenna pulls in decent reception on HD signals, but the end connector on the antenna section has a tendency to slide off, and the wires inside can break off. Mine did, I had to re-solder them back on again. To get the best reception on different channels in the area it is necessary to re-allign the antenna, so the design could have been better."
2,ANTENNA,IT TOOK ABOUT 10 DAYS FOR ME TO GET THIS ANTENNA. IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL IN MY AREA. SO I DECIDED TO RETURN IT AND E-MAILED TO SUPPLIER REQUEST TO RETURN. I'VE NOT GOT AN ANSWER. IT IS PASS 30 DAYS RETURN PERIOD NOW. SO I WILL HAVE TO KEEP IT. I DON'T USE IT. I HAD TO BUY A DIFFERENT ANTENNA AT CITCUT CITY. OVERALL: NOT A GOOD PRODUCT & BAD SERVICE.
1,Very poor product for analog. Works great on the digital channels,"I bought the product, and the reception was not too bad. (Not very good either) but within 2 months the product was already broken. It's all cheap plastic. I strongly advise not to buy this product. It's a waste of money.---update: 6/6/2006: Got myself a nice Sony Bravia with built in HDTV decoders. Suddenly I see the true power of this little thing. I get 36 pixel clear digital channels. Some of them are in HDTV format. When you switch to Analog it's all snowy, but the digitial channels are superb."
3,No reception,"This may be a very good antenna, but i can't tell because I only get one channel of reception. In reading up a little bit online, i may be too far away from a broadcast station. Something to consider when you are away from metropolitan area."
1,Awful,"This product is fragile and completely ineffective. I bought two and both fell apart within months after no more stress than simply moving them around. Not only were they fragile but they barely work at all. There was little difference in the quality of the signal received with the antenna than without it. Simple, cheaper, rabbit ears worked much better. This product is a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! I have rarely been this dissatisfied with a purchase. I wish I could give it ZERO stars."
1,Useless Piece of Junk,"Unfortunately, this indoor antenna was not what we expected. It did not work properly and did little to help focus the picture. We could have achieved a better reception by utilizing a wire hanger and some aluminum foil. Needless to say, we ended up returning the item."
2,disappointing,"I did much research and ordered this one based on the positive reviews. I guess that everyone's experiences depend on too many variables. I live within the city and no more than 10 miles from the TV stations, all channels come in clearly except for two - which are quite poor. I ordered this antenna with the hope that it would improve the reception for those two channels, but it doesn't even work as well as the rabbit ears that I bought at a garage sale (and are probably 20 years old).Also, the antenna is bigger than it appears, is rather ugly, and is pretty flimsy."
2,worse than my bunny ears,"I live in San Mateo, which is over 20+ from the main San Francisco towers. I know I won't get good reception, but I didn't think my $10 bunny ears (with a base and a circular loop piece in the middle) from Target was better than this one. The Zenith feels VERY cheap, but it's obviously working for many people. I would've rated it higher, but I can't because obviously, it can't be just my location if my bunny ears perform better. I'm mainly using it for analog reception. I bet this thing is very good if I were closer to the transmission tower, compared to using another type of antenna. But for long distances, this thing seems to be worse."
4,Works good,Does the job. I took it off the stand and just set it on top of the wall system... you cannot see it unless you are 7 feet tall.I had tried an amplified antenna first that cost twice as much.. this one is better.
4,It works,I live in an urban area and it picks up all of the local channels fine. It is small and ubobtrusive. I can't believe a cheap little piece of plastic works so well.
4,"Works ok, looks ok.","The antenna feels cheap to the touch (I know it was cheap to the wallet) but looks ok and performs ok, I rarely have to point it anywhere (I'm in North Austin) in order to get reception. Recommended."
3,"OK, but not for me","I bought this antenna b/c the reviews said it worked well in apartments. I'm not doubting that it does, but performance of the antenna depends a lot on your postition to the transmitting tower. If my condo was on the other side of the building I think it would work OK. But since I'm in the shadow of 4 walls the signal just doesn't get received. I even bought an antenna amp, and still no luck. Just make sure you know where your transmitting tower is in regards to your apartment, and you should be ok."
3,Unexpectedly poor performance,"I heard a lot of great things about this antenna, but my results weren't the best. I'm trying to get HDTV signals. Most of my signals are in the high 40's and 50's, as far as the RF frequency goes. This antennas did great with those signals. However, there were two lower frequency HDTV signals, one at 18 and another around 30. This antenna had poor performance for both of those. The one at 18 is somewhat understandable, since that's at the lower band of UHF, but supposedly the performance is even across UHF.What's worse is that I had cheap Radio Shack antenna that I tested and it did better. This was a simple rabbit ears antenna with a UHF loop and no amplification. I got about 20% stronger signals on the 18 and 30 channels, and the rest were just as good. So, the performance of this antenna wasn't abysmal or anything, just not as good as a cheap UHF loop."
4,"Excellent signal, but picky about adjustments","This is the only antenna I've tried with my HDTV PC setup, but I'm quite happy with it. antennaweb.org reports that I live 12 miles from my transmitters, and I routinely get signal strength of 88 or 90. My only quibble is that the antenna seems very picky about where it is placed. It is not so sensitive to direction (5 degrees of adjustment doesn't make much difference either way) as it is to height: if I want excellent reception on ABC, I need to have it 2 feet off the floor, but if I want excellent receiption on CBS and FOX, it has to be 5 feet off the floor. (This is in a second-story room.)On the whole I'm quite happy and think this antenna is excellent value for money."
1,An Overpriced Piece of French Junk!,"After seeing these ""Perfex"" mills online, I thought surely they had to be the Holy Grail"" of pepper mills. I have several other pepper mills but based on their price, I assumed these were as good as it gets.Boy, was I wrong!The overall outside finish is impressive except for the very rough unfinished bottom surfaces of both the body and crank arm. The real problem is the fact that one grinding surfaces, (the inside of the body) is just roughly machined out of the cast aluminum itself, while the grinder head is hardened stainless steel! It don't take much intelligence to figure out that this isn't a good combination! The unit I got was very hard to turn, wouldn't stay in adjustment (as far as grind setting), and ground erratically sized particles.Needless to say, this thing was returned very quickly to the kitchen store from where I bought it! Lesson learned."
3,Very expensive. Moderately useful,"The peppermill works well, but the size makes it somewhat awkward to use. Overall, it seems very expensive for what I received. However, the vendor service was excellent. I could have returned it if I had chosen to."
2,Should have known not to buy white,This case was dirty 10 minutes after I started using it. I bought it for the crisp white contrast - but it picks up every bit of dirt and marks up very easily. too bad - doubt I can return it.
1,"A bad movie,just like her bad acting career.","This dvd shows Zsa Zsa at her typical worst. She is beyond bad acting the whole thing is a trap to get your money and mine too.Knowing the family well, she should have paid me to watch it."
3,A compilation of silent film articles,"This book is a collection of modern and contemporary articles about silent film, with the last ten or so being reviews of mostly under-rated films of the 1920's. The stories by cameraman James Wong Howe and theatre organist Gaylord Carter give a great impression of what it was like to work in the industry. Moral czar Will Hayes also has an interesting (?) story to tell also. This book is a little over-priced because it is not very long but it is definitely recommended for silent film buffs."
4,Need to Learn Katakana Fast?,I needed to learn katakana as a prerequisite for a class I wanted to take. This book was a great way to practice and learn katakana easily and quickly. You begin by tracing over greyed out characters and then advance to forming the characters on your own. You also learn about Japanese geography and new Japanese words as you learn the characters!
2,They cut the heart out of it.,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid. I never laughed so hard in my life. It is not nearly as funny to me as it was then. I remember a lot of other comedians being in the film (Ben Turpin, Buster Keaton, etc.) that have been cut out of this film. To me, that made the video a rip off because it had been edited down to leave them out."
2,poor quality,Over-price for what you get. Started fraying after wearing a dozen times. Wanted to return and seller gives you only 7 days to return and charges a 15% restocking fee.
4,THE COOLEST CONTROL,ILL BOUGHT THIS IN TOYS R US BECAUSE ILL SEE IT INTERNET AND MI SURPRISE IS THAT IS BETTER THHAN ILL THINK THE TEETH ARE BUTTONSIT IS AWESOME AND IT HAVE A REALLY COOL SPONGEBOB DESIGN.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡BOUGHT IT BEFORE IT STOCK OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Excellent historical fiction with rich characterization,"Quentin Durward is good reading, right up (almost) to the very end. It's excellent historical fiction with very rich characterization, especially of Louis XI. Excellent, that is, except for the women. While two of the minor female characters are interesting, the female lead is as dull as dishwater. My real complaint is that the ending is bungled. After the tremendous buildup full of exciting action and convincing sets, you turn the page and...it's just over! Misses the crecendo and the denoument. Still, I enjoyed it, and recommend checking it out of the library, as I did."
5,One of Scott's finest,"I read this novel forty years ago in the Modern Library edition and I am amazed that it is out of print except in expensive library editions. It is one of Scott's finest novels, full of action and with a fine portrait of King Louis. It was the first novel to use a gypsy as a character. It was made into a movie in the 1950's. Scott of one of the most neglected geniuses in literature and the world is the poorer for it."
4,A Story We've All Heard Before,"This is a play full of dramatic and tragic irony. What are the odds of killing your father and marrying your mother without knowing. Oedipus Rex was abandoned as a child because of a prophecy saying he would grow up to kill his father, the king, and marry his mother. He grew up a peasant and one day killed a king who was traveling the opposite way on the same road as he. Obvious to us, this was his father. He later solves a riddle to save the city and is made king. He therefore must marry the queen unbeknown to him as his mother. The truth finally comes out of the mouth of a blind prophet who forsay it all in the beginning. Although you may be forced to read this play in high school or in college it is still a great play to read. It is short and easy to follow and makes for great class discussions."
4,Comparitive to many things.,"This is the type of book that you probably wont read unless you're bored or have to. It's definitely a good story that relates to society today as it was in the past. In it Oedipus ends up killing his father and marrying his mother, but in the process never realizes his fault until it's too late.If you've seen the movie ""Angel Heart"" then you should definitely read this book because of the correlation and overlapping of both stories. It was very intriguing to see something displayed on screen very alike to the text in the book."
2,a critique on Athenians,I think Oedipus Rex was a rather good book it relates really well to the Atenian times and as a critques serves rather well in portraying the drama and the lifetsyles of the ancient athenians
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was horrible. I was hoping for your typical 20-something single living in Manhattan novel, which Cat's Meow is, but I wanted some entertainment. The humor was non-gratifying and seemed to play to a very small group in society; the fashion socialites of Manhattan. The author throws around celebrity and fashion guru names as if the general public has any idea who she is referring to. This aside, the biggest problem I had with the book was the mockery the author made out of international adoption. Cat sends her personal asistant to China to buy a baby girl from an illegal baby broker not because she wants to be a mother, but because it is the ""in"" thing to do and she hopes it will help her marry rich."
3,Took me a while to get this one,"Reading this book, I was getting madder and madder, getting angrier and angrier at this 20-something generation until I finally realized---Duh! This author is not serious! It took me until I got to the part where our main character went to a doctor to try to get her legs amputated as amputee fashion was very hip."
2,Didn't Agree With The Masses,"I bought this book having read a couple of others in the high fashion genre and loved them. Can't say that about this particular book. The story seemed so over the top, not to mention it was also told in a rather choppy fashion. The main character Cat is a total airhead and so selfish, it made me want to stop reading entirely. For example, there was a reality in The Devil Wears Prada that made me really like Andy, relate to her and want to see her succeed in the challenging world of high fashion. That reality was definitely not present in this book and I ended up really disliking the characters presented. Even the ending was a total letdown. Cat tries to get bailed out by her mummy at age 29. How pathetic. Bottom line - pick a different book."
1,What? Is the first thing I thought!,"This DVD is a bunch of ""who knows who's"" giving us their opinion of Jon and the band. There is no way I would buy this again, if I could return it or give it away I would. Either you love the band or you don't and I hate that I paid the money to watch a bunch of older men try to sway my fanship. This was a total waste of money. Just my opinion... hope it helps!"
4,The American Airport,"For those who love airports and airplanes, this is a wonderful book to have. Simple, well-written, but unpretentious, it is loaded with lots of good period photographs and illustrations that cover the historical development of airports and the growth and transformations of the passenger airline industry in the United States. It would have been great if it were not limited to airports in this country, but had also included the develoment of airports all over the world. My suggestion to the author is to try just that: a second book devoted to international airports around the world and the development of the international airline system, particularly in Europe and Latin America, and, of course, including some of the exciting and ultra modern airports built in recent years accross the globe, especially in the Middle East and Asia. I'll be first in line to buy such a book! If you are an airport and airline enthusiast like me, I am sure you will very much enjoy The American Airport."
2,Situationally effective.,The sound quality is fine... as long as you keep your phone no further from the earpiece than your shirt pocket. This thing has NO range to it. It's unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design. The single rocker switch is slick and intuitive. All the design in the world doesn't mean a lick if it just doesn't work.
2,The most uncomfortable headset I've ever tried,"The title says it all. I don't have weird ears, a big or small head or anything, it's just hard plastic that causes ear irritation if worn for more than a half hour or so. I can't recommend this product.When it is in use, the quality of the sound is a little chunky and digital sounding compared to my Motorola Bluetooth headset. I don't think a headset should EVER introduce noise to a conversation, but this one does.I gave it two stars instead of one because it does function as advertised, but beyond that it's painful and annoying."
4,Good Quality for the Price,"Very comfortable to wear,easy to set up and has clear reception.I purchased 8 units at one time and they all have the same good quality.I searched the internet high and low and did not find a better headsetfor the price.I would definitely recommend this product."
5,good product,"I use this bluetooth headset for my ps3 and it works really good, no problem with set up and i here everything just fine."
2,Static and poor reception,Even after a full charge this headset continues to have static in its reception. I would not recommend this and will be seeking to return or exchange it.
4,plantronics 330 easy to use,"this bluetooth headset is really easy to use. Battery life seems to be good as i only stay on the phone for a couple hours, the most. however, when taken outside on a windy day, it picks up the wind causing some interference while talking."
4,"Plantronics ""handsfree"" earpiece","July 1st is soon and this was a ""must have"" purchase. I did a little research on this product and am very familiar with the plantronics brand. It has been working out well, it does seem to filter out the background noise and is what I needed."
3,sleek but slow,"I got this BT headset for my boyfriend.The item came in in soft package. I like my stuff in the box.It seems like it's a refurb when it shouldn't be.The headset is in a nice rubbery black, feels steady in hand. The ear piece is clicked in to a few different angles which is nice, and holds well. But the connection can be a little slow, and sometimes it drops the connection, doesn't go back on.I can hear the other person just fine... when it's connected."
2,Buy a different headset,"This is the second Bluetooth headset I have owned, to replace a Motorola H700 that was awful. I am not happy with this headset. The range is TERRIBLE. I have to have the phone sitting on my shoulder to be able to hear properly. Even then, the person I am talking to has trouble hearing me. However, it does look nice and feel comfortable in my ear. Those are the only positive things about it."
2,You get what you pay for.,"It works! I had a Motorola headset and I liked the performance, but it always felt like it was going to fall off my ear. I tried the Plantronics because it looked like it would fit more secure. The Plantronics fits very nice, I played soccer and forgot it was there. However, performanc wise, it tends to be staticky and tends to mute you as a noise reduction feature :). Next time, I'm spending more money to get performance and fit."
2,Disappointed,"I am totally disappointed in the bluetooth earpiece by Plantronics. The range is horrible. If I step outside of my office, it disengages immediately. I continuously have to reconnect. If I had not had it in my ear for over a day, I would have returned it for a full refund. Do not buy this product."
1,Not so impressed,"I was disappointed that when I would dial digits on my phone I could always hear static in the blue tooth. Then the unit would not hold a charge. I sent an e-mail to the address listed for the company on the Amazon website and it has been over a week and no one has responded. I finally ended up calling the manufacturer and they said that if I filled out some paperwork, they would replace it. I assume this will happen this week."
3,Plantronics 330,"Works as designed. Fits quite easily, and I do not experiece a high level of discomfort. Product looks good and goes well with my LG mobile. Sound appears a bit tinny, and sometime crackles. Not sure if this is a defect. People are able to hear me very good, so no problems there. Does pick up a bit of road noise when driving, so would be good to look for something with noise cancelling features, if you are looking around for one to buy.Overall, a decent buy for the money you are putting in. Bought it for less than $30."
4,good for those with bad hearing,"I was very surprised at how well I could hear everyone else with this- the only problem I have encountered is that it is hypersensitive and the people on the other end of the phone frequently complain at how loud the reception is at times- especially when you use it in the car- even with all of the windows rolled up, the reciever can still hear the noise in the background. Overall I would say I am very happy with the product and would buy it again."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This was the 1st bluetooth I purchased and I didn't want to spend over $40. It is easy to use, as advertised but the sound quality isn't great. It picks up alot of background noise and my own voice was not loud enough to the people I was calling. I returned this and purchased a better, but more expensive bluetooth."
3,"Works fine, but no Music capabilities? ;-;","@_@ Such a shame, I really was smitten with it, until I realized that my Samsung SYNC (SGH-A707) will not play music with it through the media player, and wish I was able to discover this before purchase~TT-TT NOT for MP3s or other music software~"
2,Not the best.,"The ear-piece constantly dropped the connection while I was driving. It had a lot of static when I used it at home, even if my phone was right next to me. I did return it and purchased the 510. I am happy with that one."
2,Not so great when walking ...,"I got it as a present. It worked great while driving car, but to my disappointment it was very noisy when I tried to use it while walking. I gave it a try couple of days on different times but finally gave up."
3,Plantronics,The headset fits in well with any ear and is not a bother even if you wear it for a long time. The only issue that I found is that there is a definite disturbance in sound when outside in the open. I believe it is due to interference of air with the waves. It becomes basically useless when using outside while walking down a pavement. New Yorkers would not find it handy. I use it mostly when I drive and it works just fine for me.
2,Does not work with Treo,"Nice compact headset, but will not stay coneected to my Treo 700P. Connects easily, but drops connection every 10 minutes or so. I called Plantronics and was told NONE of theie headsets are working with Treo phones.I had to return the headset in less than 24 hours"
2,Pathetic,This product should not be moved at all while talk in progress. Sound is accompanied with lot of disturbing backround noise.
5,My 2nd Plantronics 330,"This is my 2nd Plantronics Explorer 330. I bought two other Plantronics Bluetooth Headsets before I ordered the original one I had at first, the 330. The noise cancelling bluetooth had very low volume. The 330 is the best. I live in Massachuetts and I can talk to my sisters, one in Virginia and one across the country in the state of Washington. They both can heard me clearly. Love my 330 !!!"
3,OK for the price,Sound quality is good everything works as stated. But uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. I owned a Motorola H700 before this and although a little more expencive worth the price. After having this one a couple weeks I went ahead and ordered a Motorola H720 and I'll keep the 330 around as a spare for me and my wife.
3,Disappointed,"I bought the Platronics 330 because it was very inexpensive. I find it a little hard to put on. My biggest disappointment: unlike the Motorola Bluetooth H710 that has a boomer to turn the bluetooth on and off, the Plantronics 330 cannot be turn off unless you disable the bluetooth function from the phone. For example, when I drive, I used the Plantronics headset. I took it off after arrived at the destination. The next time the cell rings, the call will be channeled to the headset. I would not to be able to pick up from my cell.Plantronics Explorer 330 Easy-To-Use Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth-Enabled Phones"
3,Not what i hoped for,The audio quality of the Bluetooth headset is great and the price was good. The only draw back i had was that everytime you end a call the bluetooth is disconnected from the phone and i had to reconnect the bluetooth to the phone before i can use it again and that was very frustrating.
2,Catches all kinds of noise,"When I talk to people using this headset they always complain about the background noise. Even if I am outside and there isn't any noise other than the wind, they can hear the crackling wind noise.I wanted to return the item, but I decided to keep it....just to use at home and in complete silence. But I was definitely dissapointed with the inability of this gadget to filter the background noise."
2,It hurts my Ear so BAD!!!,"I personally think Plantronics Voyager 510 is still the best choice to go.I love my Plantronics Voyager 510, too bad I lost it.I bought this one because it seems like it is a new product.I dang made a wrong choice...Plantronics Voyager 510 felt so comfortable when put it on the ear, but this one just hurts my ear like hell!"
3,"Excelent headset, but the shipping was inefficient","You can buy this product, the headset has a very good sound quality. The only problem went the estimated delivered date from USPS, were four days late in delivering the headset."
1,HORRIBLE HEADSET!!!!!!!,This Headset is HORRIBLE or maybe it's just the one i got but either way it sucks and i thought Plantronic's had a good name!
3,It broke,"Although this earpiece worked very well, I happened to drop it and the earpiece broke off from the rest of the Bluetooth. There is no way to fix it because the piece that broke is plastic so here I am with a perfectly fuctioning earpiece that is unusable. Very frustrating.All I can say is that if you buy it, don't drop it."
1,avoid at all costs. useless.,"i bought this headset based on cnet reviews and the reviews here. sadly i was wildly misled. i bought this to replace a logitech mobile traveller that my dog chewed to pieces. got ""decent"" reviews, not too expensive, and supposedly good voice quality. too bad none of the above was true in ANY sense of the word.don't get me wrong, it's a FABULOUS headset IF you don't get any calls. or make any. but there is where it falls down rather badly.pro's: cheap.cons: cheap. poorly madepoor controls,proprietary obnoxious power pluguncomfortable, and yes, i know how it's ""supposed"" to be adjusted.died an unassuming and ignominious death some 3 weeks after purchase. won't turn off, won't pair, just sits there malevolently blinking at me.avoid this headset. i have used many, and this one is the worst of a bad lot."
1,Works only when close,"Very disappointed with the product. You have to keep in within arms length for it to work good.I had a less expensive Plantronics headset that worked really great.I have a Blackberry 8310, Motorola works better with this phone."
4,A good basic bluetooth headset,This headset works well with my Motorola KRZR cell phone. It's sound is loud and clear. It charges rather quickly. It is very basic for a beginner. It dosen't have very good battery life though.
2,Good Price - Bad to Hear,"Good news = The Bluetooth works, had not problem synching to my blackberry.Bad news = Horrible clarity, if there is any sort of road noise the person on the other end cannot hear you! (whats the point of hands free?!?!) You never know when the Bluetooth is low on battery, and you cant turn it off..if you turn it on it runs for a long time. Sometimes when you already have it on your year and you want to end a call it will not end the call. When you want to make a call it goes to ""voice command"" instead of just regular dial which can be annoying because your phone cant hear you on the Bluetooth. The sound gets very garbled if you are more than a foot away from your phone (again whats the point) I have heard bad things about all Bluetooth headsets so this is just like all the others, but its a good price so if you really NEED one get it anyway (rather pay less then more for a crapy product in general)"
2,Works great but swivels right off your ear,"I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!"
2,Not very satisfied,"I thought this product was great at first. It fits nicely and lasts a long time without needing to charge it. However, everyone I talk to say that they hear tons of background noise. The microphone picks up on everything around you and the person listening cannot hear you very well. I have to buy another."
1,Doesn't work,"i recently bougth 2 of this headset bluethoot, but i have to say that when one worked ok, the other doesn't work at all, i think that the batery is the one that doesn't charge, but the fact is that i paid for two and i just get one in good conditions, so it's like if i paid for a expensive one... I would ask for a refund, but the problem is that i'm on Guatemala, so i didn't just paid for the headset, i had to pay to bring it to Guatemala... and it doesn't work... i would have prefer to buy one here in Guatemala."
4,Easy to use,I've used MANY types of bluetooths. This Plantronics bluetooth is excellent for those that keep their phone on them the entire time. When I walk across my bedroom and keep my phone on the charger it gets fuzzy. That's my only complaint but otherwise a great bluetooth!
4,Good headset,"I really like this headset of the two I've had before, mostly because it has the piece that fits inside your ear. The over the ear clip isn't loose and fits okay. The only thing that bothers me is sometimes if I don't have the headset in my ear properly, that inside piece irritates my ear. Other than that it's a really good headset. I like it better than the two Motorola's headsets I've had in the past."
4,Comfortable product!!,"When shopping for a headset, comfort to wear was one of my primary requirements and this satisfied that requirement the best. Performance is good and is light weight. The only problem I have found is people on the recieving side complain of external noise when I use the headset while driving with the windows rolled down or while travelling in the bus..Recommended."
2,Not sure it's worth your money,"A lot of static noise in the background. Very limited range for signal - I pretty much have to have my cell phone on me, in my pocket or purse, in order to have a decent signal through my Bluetooth device. I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
3,Plantronics Head Set,"It is ok, it works great until you put your phone in your pocket, and it has to stay on the same side of your body as your ear piece. And sometimes it is has static pretty bad. Not as good as the reviews that I read made it out to be."
1,Plantronics Explorer 330 Bluetooth headset,"I've used a similar product from Plantronics before, so I am familiar with its operation. This unit however has not performed as expected because it seems to transmit any and all background noise (interior vehicle road noise, wind, etc) which makes it uncomfortable for the people I'm trying to converse with to understand me. Very disappointed."
4,"Works well, but at close range","This headset works well enough for my use. One problem I have with it is the range, which isn't very far. If I have my phone in my purse, and the headset on the opposite ear, there is usually static. If I switch the headset to the other ear, everything is fine. Also, there is static if the phone is in my pants pocket. So the range only seems to be about 2 feet without static. The headset also picks up a lot of ambient noise. People I am talking to can hear when I have music on in my car at a very low volume. But overall, the voice quality is good on both ends and it is very comfortable."
3,This DOES work with Treo 700p (at least with mine),"It's a fairly good headset. Negatives: does a poor job of screening out wind noise & other noises; when I make a 2nd call, it doesn't always find the phone & I have to punch a few buttons to get it working again.Positives: very comfortable - I forget I have it on; fairly discreet looking; battery life is very good; hooks up to my phone (Treo 700p) seamlessly - I very rarely have to pair it up again; I can hear very well, even in my noisy diesel pickup!"
4,Surprisingly good product for the price,"At this price is incredible to find a bluetooth headset that has a good design/weight, functions, easy-to-sync properties and of course, great sound. I've used it with my Nokia 6300 as well as my iPhone. The Nokia has voice recognition dialing that can be activated from the headset without touching the phone.About the fit in your ear, well, I know there may be more confortable options, but to be honest, I constantly forget I'm wearing it until my cell phone rings; it is light, has a good grip and fits smoothly on either one of your ears."
2,ok product,"product came on time and in condition described however i ghot mixed responses as far as audio quality.i could hear ppl fairly well, but usually got complaints about ppl not hearing me.and the range to walk away from phone is not great.product did however fit nicely nad comfortably.i loved the in ear over ear design."
3,pretty good,"this product is pretty good,I have bought one for everyone in the house.mine works great, limited range though.Husbands is okay. the boys they said it works fine."
3,Sufficient,"This headset works well as long as you're not too far from your phone (I use the Samsung Blackjack II)and it doesn't seem to perform well outside where wind and other noise can interfere. In my case, it seems you can't be as far away as the standard says you can be for good quality reception. Otherwise, the sound quality of a good connection is quite good and it's very comfortable to wear. After a while, you don't even notice it's there."
2,Really bad static if more than two feet from the receiver,"I bought this Explorer 330, because I was so happy with the Plantronics Voyager 510. No two products could be more different in quality. True, this headset is much more sleek and modern-looking (the 510 does look a little like a hearing-aid), but it had a great range of at least 15 to 20 feet. This is not AT ALL the case with the 330. You will need to wear it on the same side of your body as your phone if you do not want to deal with unbearable voice distrotion and static. It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset. I will be returning mine and sticking with the 510."
1,Plantronic,The bluetooth will not pair. It does not work at all it was useless. If there is any way to send it back i would. i have it new as they sent it but it was useless. the sender was bad.
4,Plantronics 330 with Droid X,"I have had this headset for a few years and it has been sitting in a box for about a year. Just pulled it out and paired it with my Droid X and it works fine. It was easy to pair and the sound is good. I have no problem with the comfort, since I only use it occasionally. Good inexpensive headset. I have owned 3 Plantronics headsets and I liked all of them. If I were buying a new headset I would probably get the 520."
5,just a blink to connect it and use it,i love plantronics headset easy to use and can compare with almost any phone and computer.i bought usb headset for my computer play games and talk with my girlfriend it's fantastic.i have iphone4 and try to get right bluetooth headset could not find any.finally i read lots of reviews and order this one.got it today and it can use it my phone i feel so happy and in future i know i feel the same.
3,just ok,I guess you get what you pay for. This is just ok. People say it sounds like I am in a wind tunnel when i am in the car even if i have all the windows shut.
2,Good brand-Bad product,"Plantronics makes excellent Bluetooth products but the explorer 330 isn't one of them. I don't know if I just happened to get the 'bad apple' out of the bunch because I've had several problems with it. For starters, I can barely hear the person on the other end without static ringing in my ear. Also, when I'm on the phone I get consistent complaints that they can't hear me on the other end. Aside from that it's big & bulky, someone actually asked me 'why is your Bluetooth so big?' :/I have an iPhone 3G & Blackberry Curve, I got the same problems on both."
3,Okay item for the price.,"Maybe I just have sensitive ears, but this device picks up all sorts of background noise and the sounds are too sharp for my ears to handle. It works great, however, when the person you are talking to is in the car (w/o the radio on) or some other completely quiet place. Overall, I only use this bluetooth when I'm driving or have a lot of things to do and cannot easily hold a phone."
4,Plantronics Bluetooth Headset,"Plantronics Explorer 330 Easy-To-Use Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled PhonesLightweight,easy to use. A little complicated on the pairing function at the beginning with my Dash."
2,Not For MP3 Function,"This is a great product and it was a great price, however it does not work with MP3 player on the Samsung Blast phone. Otherwise it seems to be ok. Too bad the product description does not mention it will not work with MP3 players. I think thats poor technical writting."
4,Book review,"This book had a number of relatives mentioned in it, which made it more interesting, and the main reason I bought the book. I still have relatives living there, but not the same ones in the book. Good read if you are interested in the history of that area, otherwise, might not mean much."
1,Don't buy if you have VISTA,"I bought this software a few months ago, and loved it. However, circumstances were such I had to buy a new laptop - preloaded with Vista.Laplink 12 does not work with Vista, and the company's representative was unable to tell me if it will EVER support Vista. I really didn't like their answer. Since Vista is inevitable on nearly all machines, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy it.Meanwhile I have software I can't use, an annual fee I can't get a refund for, and I'm paying $19.95 plus tax for a popular web-based version of remote desktop and file sharing software.I think Laplink missed the boat on this one."
1,Not for synching Outlook,"Don't buy this if the main thing you want to synch is Outlook - which I did, hoping to help my laptop and desktop communicate about the main program I use."
5,"So miserable, it's funny!","This book is just awesome. I bought this for my daughter. I read it, laughed, and realized I would never read this to a small child. It's so miserable it's funny. The drawings are morbidly beautiful, the story is tragic and hilarious, Edward Gorey is like the Tim Burton of adult children's books."
5,My favorite of his works,"This is the first book I ever read by Gorey. After becoming a bit of a fan and exploring his writings further, I think this story holds up as having the best narrative and shock value. A great little yarn and a must for the collector."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Lifepod really has nothing in common with Hitchcock's Lifeboat aside from the basic premise of ""people stuck together in a confined space, one of whom is an enemy"" so it should be assessed on its own terms; judged alone, it's an enjoyable and reasonably successful sci-fi film that will keep you entertained even if the low production values become increasingly obvious as the film progresses."
5,Very dependable!,"I've had three Canon Waterproof cases over the past four years. Each for a different model of a canon camera I've owned. The first year the case held out well, until one day I was in a rush and didn't pay attention to the rubber seal, which was twisted and didn't seal properly. Needless to say I fried my camera. However, that was completely my fault. Having learned my lesson I've never had another incident. I've taken these camera cases everywhere: swimming, kayaking, and diving. I've been over 100 feet down with my canon camera and waterproof case and everything held up perfect! I definitely recommend these cases. They are very durable and can withstand some abuse. Just be careful you don't get the seal twisted. =)"
4,Good Value,"If you're like me and just want to take pictures and not ""photographs"" and don't want to spend a lot of cash, you'll like this housing. Dove three times before I got the nerve to put the camera inside but, it performed beautifully."
5,Affordable underwater digital camera with great results,"I purchased this case and my A620 at the same time just for diving. This is my first underwater digital camera, easy to use and comes with a preset scene for underwater photos. Canon's case is one of the reasons I chose the A620, also like the use of standard AA batteries available everywhere. Took 70-80 pictures per dive on same set of batteries, had the camera on most of the time to be ready for the next photo opportunity. Although the A620 has a fast boot and is quickly ready to shoot. I was not using gloves, so the buttons were easy to operate, may be a bit difficult in cold water with heavy gloves. Took a couple of short movies, but was wanting to preserve the space on my card. With more experience I am sure I will be switching between still underwater and movies more. Great way to get into quality underwater photography for less than $500."
5,LIttle big,"This is a good case but is bulky. If you have no big hand you will not bee very happy with this.For a low budget photgrapher or a regular human being who wants underwater photographies, this is for you, you take excellent underwater photos and video.Let you use all the functions and buttons.Note: When is in video mode you don't have audio, the camera is sealed inside the case.NO worries for sand, dust, fog, snow, rain etc in your trips."
5,Great Product Delivered Quickly,The waterproof case arrived in perfect (new) condition overnight as promised. I was especially impressed because it was coming to me on my vacation in Maui and shipped on a holiday. Thanks for saving our vacation photos!
4,Greatly funny just as I remembered it classic!!!,Movie was just like I remembered bought it used and it was in great shape basically like new very satisfied with it
5,TWO BIRDS OF A FEATHER AND JUST PLAIN COOKO,"THIS IS THE FUNNIEST MOVIE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I HAVE NEVER EVEN SEEN A FUNNIER MOVIE. EXCEPT OF COURSE ALL OF THE OTHER ONES THAT THEY ARE IN TOGETHER. I KNOW SO MANY PARTS OF THE MOVIE IT ISN'T EVEN FUNNY. THIS IS ONE MOVIE THAT I CAN STAND TO WATCH OVER, AND OVER AGAIN. IF THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN GO RENT IT NOW. I DON'T HAVE TO RENT IT BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT."
3,Stir Crazy,"My son and I really enjoyed this movie.Of course,we like anything with Richard Pryor in it.I'd highly reccommend it and be prepared for a lot of laughs."
3,Great movie potential...falls apart after one hour!,"This movie could have been a 5 star but alas is let down by a bland one hour ending. Great moments include the Pryor scene where his weed is accidently put into the salad and is served to an unexpected dinner party that has hilarious moments. My favourite, as is most who have seen this is the Jail scene. Pryor stole this part with his 'my mother was a sharp son of .... my brother was so sharp we couldn't even see him...' bit. The Jail break planning and the break itself was where this movie failed. There is hardly any dialogue, lame soundtrack, and absolutely NO COMEDY between Pryor and Wilder. Don't ignore the film because of this, as the first hour is probably the funniest thing you'll ever see!I'd still watch the film though just for the first hour and then select the end credits with that 'nothins gonna stop us now' song. If you like the Wilder and Pryor pairing than watch Silver Streak."
5,Almost 20 years old... and still just as funny,"Actually... this would get 4.5 stars... only because Wilder is even greater in Woman in Red, but Richard Pryor more than pushes it over the top. One on my all time favorite movies... the only compairsion would be other Wilder/Pryor films."
3,A good if uneven film,"That bit about that hulking murderer killing his family, all his relatives, and everyone who reminds him of them in one weekend was uneven. The fag in the film Murray might actually be a girl is uneven as an element. But the film still has lots of laughs just the same."
3,Wilder + Pryor = Big Laughs,"Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor are at the top of their comedic game in this uneven prison comedy. Despite a routine screenplay and Sidney Poitier's nondescript direction, ""Stir Crazy"" (1980) emerges as a spirited follow-up to ""Silver Streak."" Plenty of hilarious moments - highlighted by the famous courtroom scene. The second Wilder-Pryor pairing solidified their screen chemistry, which resumed nine years later in ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil."""
5,You'd have to be CRAZY not to love this outstanding blu-ray!,"Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor are the last great comedy team, so I'd have picked this blu-ray up even without the generous bonus features contained herein. Thanks to Image Entertainment for another OUTSTANDING release!"
2,Reader Beware--the author has his own agenda.,"Witherington states that he is presenting a synopsis and commentary of biblical scholars who are on the ""Third Quest"" for the historical Jesus. What he fails to mention until the latter half of the book is that he considers himself one of the Third Questers who has his own interpretation of the historical Jesus. This revelation immediately places into question the validity of his critiques of the other questers. Without personal knowledge of the thought of the scholars presented, the reader has no way of knowing whether Witherington has adequately, much less accurately, presented their positions. The book is useful in helping the reader to appreciate the vast number of theories circulating about the historical Jesus, but the reader must read Witherington's critiques in light of his hidden agenda."
1,I don't get the delivery over 1 month,I don't get the book delivered yet. Could you please reprocess this delivery?Grant
2,Tepid and querulous,"Witherington's book disappoints because it tantalizes the reader intoexpecting a transcending view of the historical-Jesus controversy,but in fact it is merely another partisan effort. You will like it if youalready accept that the Gospels are blandly historical; or, asWitherington hopefully avers in the foreword, if you already believethat Christ is reigning in glory and only waiting for you to notice. Butfor that matter, sermons are much cheaper than hardcover books,and are available in churches all across the land every Sunday."
4,Witherington brings things down to earth,"Witherington definitely has his own agenda, I wouldn't deny that. However, some of these previous reviewers seem to believe that some books come to be inside an opinion vacuum. to them: EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN AGENDA!! Witherington puts forth a study of the Jesus Quest that I found helpful and quite enlightening. My largest criticism of Witherington's book is that it is difficult to read."
4,Fair reviews,"Unlike the other reviewers, I do not see the author as polemic or unfair. He provides reasonable arguements to back his claims. Perhaps he is somewhat harsh on Marcus Borg, but his arguements with the Jesus Seminar are certainly shared by many others (such as Meier). There are only two criticisms I would have: the writing is not as engaging as authors like Meier or Vermes and the book's value primarily would be to those who have read a fair number of the texts he references. To get a picture of Jesus just from this book and biblical accounts would be a mistake."
3,Finding the strong feminine side of God,"Ms Gateley seeks to redress the imbalance in our traditional Catholic / Christian view as God. The Judge, the stern Father, the remote.She shows God's ""warm, moist, salty"" side, Her feminine side. (Doesn't the title evoke incredible memories of freshly baked bread being taken from the oven, its fragrance and tastes lingering in memory for years!)The book is short and segmented. It can be taken in small easily digestable bites, or raced through with glee and delight.If you want a different view, a different approach to God, if you wonder why God seems so far off and unattuned to your wavelength, give this book a chance. It's on my gift list."
1,Good idea - Bad execution,"I love almost all Tabasco products and living in Louisiana, I can buy them local. However, this specialty hot sauce was not done right. Unfortunately, the first ingredient of this stuff is high-fructose corn syrup. Notwithstanding taste, it pours thicker than any sauce I've ever seen that it looks ""gummy"" almost. For a Louisiana company, you'd think they would support their local sugar farmers and at least use a sugar syrup instead. I'd stay away from any product with high-fructose corn syrup, and this is one of them."
4,Mostly works,"I have always used Glade floss in the past but after the company was sold to P&G it seemed as though the formula changed because it now breaks easily. In my search for another floss I have read other reviews about Tom's floss and the only negative comments I found had to do with the floss being ""thick"" and difficult to use for people whose teeth are close together with little space between the teeth. I have that problem but thought I'd try the floss because it is sold in our local health food store. I think the floss is great and would be a perfect choice for most people. It is quite ""thick"" though and I do have some trouble using it and it tends to shred a little in tight spaces but it doesn't break and does a great job otherwise. It's a perfect choice for most people but those with tight spacing should give it try with the knowledge that it might not work for you."
3,Life of Christ,"This video has a setting of Jesus' time and is detailed in explaining the teaching of christ. I was very impressed with the Last Supper, this scene made me feel as if I were actually joining Christ. The way leven bread was made was very interesting to me. Check this video out and add it to you collection as I did."
2,What a disappointment,"OK.. I was actually looking forward to receiveing this CD. My mistake. So Michael landau is a player, and recognized as such. The songs suck, and no matter what, it always comes down to the songs. They have no meaningful structure, the lyrics are non sense half the time and the vocals are painful to listen to......Are you kidding me?? How could you listen to this and think thats worthy of releasing?"
4,Good guitar - not a great singer.,"Michael was not on my musical radar but saw him playing in Melbourne Australia with Robben Ford, liked what I heard and chased him down on Amazon. This is pretty damned good but gets a wee bit self-indulgent in places. About 2/3 of it is good enough to warrant your hard earned $ if you are a guitar nut."
3,Stud Poke Her,"This is one movie that grew entirely from its failings into one of the most influential movies of the last 20 years.How could the director of ""Taxi Driver"" blow it? The ingredients were in line: attractive stars: Model of the decade, Lauren Hutton; Richard Gere, Slim Von Wink;supporting cast,Hector Elizondo, Latino on the rise, Bill Duke (future director)and the blond near-actress tied to Howard Hughes, Nina Von whatever.The movie rides entirely on the surface, two wheels instead of four on the ground. Slick, teasing.Innuendos,political smear. The screenwriter could not tie the pieces together into a cohesive drama. You didn't know whether it would be a political thriller or a fashion thriller. The clothes, the glitter and gloss blend with the gross. You had as much concern for Gere's fate as his choice of wardrobe at the end. Let the music play, end of movie.Made you want to shop forever.All wrapping.Strictly beefcake."
1,American Gigolo - Everything goes wrong except music,"This movie was not sexy, it was boring and it just went on forever(all those fade outs and fade ins at the end got on my nerves-enough already director-time to yell - that's a rap!).Actors(especially Gere and Hutton) talk as if they are heavily medicated on some type of pain pills. Sex scenes are not even sexy of this type of film genre. I think a happier-""GRADUATE"" type of ending would have improved picture somewhat. The music is the only reason I give this film one star because as a big eighties music fan and since I was in J-High and H-school during this period I have a personal bias towards Blondie, otherwise don't waste you're time with this dud of a picture."
3,about the DVDfilm/movie American Gigolo.............,"Singapore is also selling the same product as this and have already watch the copy. The story is basically about a woman interested in Julian (Richard Gere) and in the end Julian is involved in murder which the woman whom love her try to explain for him to the juridicial people whom is investigating in this case....etc and the story ended. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVDfilm/movie.American GigoloReview by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector Lou Ye (Ang Poon Kah) for film summer palace.Director Bret Wood (Ang Poon Kah) for film psychopathia sexualis"
3,Ehhhhh,"I like Richard Geere he is a Spectacular actor.... But this movie is so, vaguely homo erotic its spooky.... I probably wont see it again."
3,A film to drool by,"American Gigolo I felt started the trend of sexy ""chick"" flim. Richard Gere's performance as a overachieving stud living in ""fast lane"" LA has semi-hardcore appeal; with a touch a soft eroctia blended nicely into the mix. Lauren Hutton's role as a rich woman looking for fun didn't appeal to me that much since I felt her character did not help along with the plot."
1,American Gigolo Region 2,"I got totally ripped of by rarewaves.com. I did not want or order American gigolo region 2 DVD, they do not work on Canadian or American DVD players. The customer service I received from them is extremely poor. I want a total refund for both of my purchases under my Amazon.com guarantee at once and suggest taking them off Amazon.com to prevent other customers from getting ripped off too."
3,LLOOONNNGGG READ,"I'll make this short and simple since I'm sure by now we all know or get the idea of what Riding Dirty is about. Actually there isn't much to the story. This book took me an entire month to read. I kept putting down after reading 10 pages, etc. The story started out strong, then just got really boring. I wish there was more umph to it, or whatever you want to call it. The book mos def left a lot to be desired and unanswered. Anyway, I'll give this book a 3. My first book read by Nikki Turner but won't be my last. Not a complete upset, I just like more action!"
3,Very slow...,"This is my first Nikki Turner novel, and I thought it was very slow. The character development in this book was weak. It was hard to keep reading it, because everything moved so slowly. I will attemnpt to read another one of Ms. Turner's novels."
5,AWESOME,"THIS BOOK WAS A REALLY GOOD RIGHT IF I HAVE TO SAY SO MYSELF. I WASA TAKEN IN FROM THE BEGGINING. I WAS REALLY ROOTING FOR MERCY, SHE REMINDS ME ALOT OF MYSELF. ANYWAY PICK IT UP IT WAS A GOOD READ."
3,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!,"I have read all of her books and this book was interesting and has some very good parts but was NOT the best work from Nikki Turner. A Hustler's Wife was her best work. The book began with the potential for greatness and ending leaving you feeling as is something was missing like 4 or 5 more chapters. Other parts of the story are left unanswered. She could have blended a hell of a story if she would have taken a little more time with this one. Oh well, Nikki has to come harder or she will lose me as a reader. She has the talent it just was not all there in this book. Don't believe the hype about this one being the best. It's a decent book but GREAT I DON'T THINK SO. It makes me wonder who is writing these reviews her friends?!!!"
4,"They hopin' that they gon catch me ridin' dirty, tryin to catch me ridin dirty!","Miss. Turner put her foot into Riding Dirty on I-95. Mercy's life was a nightmare. The scene of Mercy's father's funeral was dreadful. My god, the poor man was already deceased. That scene was made for Hollywood. This is to John Singleton, The Hughes Brothers or Hype Williams ... get at my girl, Nikki. LOLMercy went from group homes to the red carpet. I was thankful that she finally found success as a writer/filmmaker and true love with Cleezy whom she was able to tame. He certainly needed it because he was a reckless fool.There were some characters in this book: Mercy's trifling mother, Cleezy's thieving mother, Jus the snitch, Raheem the playa playa (had to write it twice) and that punk Taymar.The way this book was written and ended, there's bound to be another installment. Overall, I thought the book was an excellent read. I completed it in 24 hours."
4,Highway Shawdy,This was a good read. Right from the beginning it grabs your attention as she experiences her first tragedgy. And that was just the beginning of an even rockier journey for Mercy. She showed great determination and perseverance to not become another urban girl left behind.
3,Dragged on......,"I have read all Nikki Turner's books. And I enjoyed her books. She has really grown in my opinion as a writer from her first book. Riding Dirty was a bit slow. I don't need a whole lot of action, but when you are skipping pages to see what is going to happen next, then yhea, you may need a tad bit more action to get you through the book. The story line was unique, and it was very well established, but it was too long for no reason and it really did not get to the point quick enough. A plus in this book, 1. not too much violence and the characters were believable and 2. was the fact that the grammar/spelling was on point. I would recommend this book, it just did not do it for me."
3,IT WAS OKAY,I DID ENJOY THE BOOK HALF WAY THREW THAT IS THIS BOOK DRAGGED ALONG AND THEN WHEN SHE AND CLEEZY FINALLY GET TOGETHER ITS OVER BORING I'M SO GLAD SHE MADE IT SO THAT MEANS PART TWO SHOULD BE A BANGER NIKKI IS STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE HER BOOKS BUT THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETER WE DIDNT REALLY GET A CHANCE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THE FACT THAT THEY WHERE A COUPLE CLEEZY IS A REAL-G MERCY IS A A PITBULL IN A SKIRT THATS WHAT'S UP CANT WAIT FOR PART TWO.
5,She does it again!!!,"This book was hott! I am a Nikki Turner fan, and she did not let me down with this novel. In my opinion, it is the best one that she has written so far. The ending was off the chain... so the best advice that I can give you is that if you've read ""The Glamorous Life"" or ""A Hustler's Wife"", then you will love this book."
2,Wasn't one of Nikki's best :0/,This wasn't one of Nikki Turner's best books. Which kind of surprised me because I loved her other novels. Riding Dirty almost felt like she had a deadline to meet and rushed it. The things that Mercy did really didn't coincide with the character that Nikki had built her up to be. As a street smart hood saavy chick Mercy(in my opinion) wouldn't have done alot of things she did even if it was for love. I never skip pages in her books but found myself skipping ahead trying to get back to the interesting parts. The reason I bought the book was based off of Nikki's name alone. The beginning started off pretty good with the drama of her losing her dad on her birthday but towards the middle it tapered off and never picked back up. I will read Nikki Turner again but I wouldn't recommend this book.
3,Ok I Guess.............,I read this book some time ago...it was a great read but it really didnt catch my attention...the way it end was lik WTH...Lol!!!!
3,A borrow not a Buy,"To start i am a avid fan of nikki truners other works and love her abillity to be able to capture you in the story and make you feel like you experiencing it first hand but however this book just didn't do it for me. I could see how the polt might do it for some. It was written quite well and was very action packed but it just didn't take me there, i wasn't captured and pulled in like i was with nikki's other three books. It was a nice effort but i just didn't do it for me, i found myself struggling to keep reading it. But to give my honest opinion this is a book you just have to read to determind how you feel about it. If you look at the reviews other then mine either people feel like it didn't capture them or they thought it was great. So i suggest borrow it before you buy it. To complete my review im going to give riding dirty on i-95 3 stars for effort."
3,This book was just ok....,"This was the first book by Nikki Turner that I read and I was disappointed. I probably shouldn't have bought into all the hype that I'd read about the 'queen of hip-hop fiction' and all that mess. But, hell, I did. LOL. Anyway, I thought the plot was weak and like many other reviewers stated there were plenty of flaws in the storyline and unbelievable characters. I hoped for alot more, but this one was weak. I'll read another one, but if the next one let's me down then there'll be no more Nikki for me."
4,Very enjoyable...,"This was my first time reading Nikki Turner, so I don't have any of her other books to compare to. I thought this book was very enjoyable, it kept me turning the page. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers, that some of the course of events were just not realistic to me. But, we are reading FICTION. The point that I took away from the book was that the main character just wanted to be loved and accepted for who she was. She was doing so much for others trying to get that acceptance, she learned that she wasn't honoring herself in the process. She learned that she had to look out for herself, and not rely on other people. This was a good read in my opinion."
2,Sorry Nikki,Nikki My Girl!!!To me this one seem to be slow and to long time to get to the point I found my self skipping pages to get the action. Sorry Nikki Your a great writer I just didnt FEEL this one!!!
2,Voice and comments irritating,"While the general flow of the yoga exercises is good, I just could not get past his voice, which I found irritating. I also found most of his interjected comments or random thoughts to be silly and distracting. I donated the book and CD to charity."
5,It works,Better than blowing hot breath or spit on your lens. More powerful than I can spit air out. It's bigger than I was expecting (bulb takes up my entire palm). The red tip comes out and you can invert it for storage. It does what it's supposed to and it does it well. Worth getting if you want to care for your camera.
5,Works Well,"This was bigger than I thought, however it does the job that I need it to do without much effort. Seems rather durable and creates the burst of air you need to clean lenses, sensors, camera body, etc...."
5,Does what it does and does it well,Performs just as one would expect. It is pretty powerful compared to the cheap one I bought a long time ago. It feels like it will last a long time. BTW it is quite large so it will take up space in your bag.
4,Just What I Was Looking For,"Almost like having an unlimited air can that doesn't spray too hard for delicate electronics, glasses, sunglasses, and even blowing the dust out of my keyboard. It does take some serious pumping to get a good blast of air, but I imagine since I got the large its probably more effective than the medium or small. I would recommend this."
3,Pretty Good,"I wouldn't say it blasts but it does pretty good. It's not as powerful as the aerosol cans they sell but it doesn't lose pressure like a can does. It might deserve 4 stars, I'm satisfied with it."
5,Required,"This is an essential piece of your SLR kit, as it is the absolute easiest way to clean obnoxious dust off the sensor. Even the auto-cleaning sensor feature on some SLR cameras do not perform as well as a good, solid gust of air from this rubber rocket.Too much air pressure could also damage the sensor, so this rocket is the perfect solution. Enough to clear the dust off, but not enough to damage the delicate interior parts."
4,great for lenses,used this to clean my lens before i put my UV filter on.Does the job without any problems
4,"The best around, but don't expect the force of compressed air.","I bought this because I tried a compressed air can (exactly once) and discovered how it showered my UV filter with tiny water droplets, creating a much bigger problem. In short, this is the most powerful squeeze blower, but don't believe the hype that the force compares to compressed air-- it doesn't. Also, the blower is much bigger than the standard silver dollar-size, but it's still plenty small for a camcorder user to fit in their bag (for SLR users, maybe not)."
3,Larger than it looks in pictures,This came as a BIG surprise. I expected a a small palm sized blaster. I have not used as yet but seems powerful.
5,Essentials,"is an essential tool for anyone who owns a DSRL and wants to clean safely from the camera body, lens and sensor."
3,This thing really blows LOLROFL1,"I purchased the extra-large air blaster specifically for cleaning computers cases, after going through can after can of compressed air. While it certainly moved the dust bunnies around a little, that really isn't what this is for. It is perfectly fine at cleaning keyboards, USB ports, fan exhausts, etc - but it's not a compressed air replacement by any means. As soon as I buy a $5,000 photo lens, I'm all set."
3,"It's good, but...","I just bought this and I thought it would blow air just as hard as the air canisters (the ones with liqiud). It is probably 3/4 the power of the cans. It'll blow off dust but not as much as the cans. Of course the cans don't blow off all the dust completely, but it has a more consistant air flow and a stronger air burst. This one needs sqeezing by your hand."
1,"Used it once, broke my Canon 40D","Title says it all, on the first use trying to clean the sensor of my Canon 40D it broke something. The mirror mechanism no longer functions properly and the camera shows an error when trying to take pictures. Not sure the bust of air that this thing creates is gentle enough - maybe for front element lens cleaning, but not for sensor cleaning!"
2,I can blow harder...,"I decided to get the larger version after reading reviews of the smaller one not really doing any good; the large one seems to be just as useless. I'll stick to compressed air. Maybe this has use for camera lenses or something else; I just wanted something to clean the dust off of my computer quickly without having to buy a new can every couple of weeks. Maybe I didn't know what I was buying.P.S. - The title of this review is not, in any way shape or form, an invitation. XD"
5,"Excellent, large and powerful to remove dust","Perfect for use on camera lenses, it works really well at removing loose dust. Just then needs followed up with a good quality lens cloth or lensPEN."
3,Too Big,Way bigger then will fit in any camera bag. I thought this would fit in mine before I bought it. Didnt realize its the size of Kansas. Does produce enough wind to blow away dust and rocks from your lens and mirror.
3,It's okay,"Does not have the air power I thought I'd get from device. Size fits in a medium size gear bag with your other equipment. Works for most dust on your lens and camera body, but not 100%."
5,Highly Recommended,"Having DSLR has its own benefits, but cleaning lenses and filters all the time from lint, dust, and finger prints is not one of them! These Giotto's Rocket Blaster can ease your pain of cleaning camera equipment exponentially. This is my third one and by far the best. I've also two smaller ones,Giottos AA1910 Medium Rocket Air Blaster (6.6)andGiottos AA1920 Rocket Air Blaster Small (Black), but this one simply blows the other ones away! You cannot imagine how much air it does blow. You cannot go wrong with Giotto's quality, and they last a long time."
3,Not as good as I thought,"The ""large"" air blaster does an OK job, but doesn't put out quite as much air as I thought it would based on some of the reviews. I'm satisfied with the product, but am glad I didn't get the ""medium"" size. If you're on the fence, go big."
4,good sensor cleaner,"At first the design seems very hokey, but then you realize it is so the thing can stand. If you lay an item like this on its side it could pick up dirt on the nozzle and transfer it to the sensor you're trying to clean! No worries with this one, though.It seems to send a large volume of air at high speed to blow debris off your sensor. It's also pretty good and blowing dust off lenses and filters. Always preferable to making physical contact with what you're trying to clean. I definitely would recommend this item."
5,Rocket Blaster is a Blast,The rocket blaster is perfect for removing dust on the sensor. It took two tries to finally get all the dust but it did what it was designed to do very well. The blast is just the right amount of pressure to dislodge all dust and make for a clean job. Well worth the purchase.
4,Big but gives a real blast of air.,It's big and pain to fit in a camera bag when space is tight.(and when isn't it?) Really does blow off all the dust and bits. Mainly keep mine on the shelf at home and use for deep cleanings.
4,"Unwieldy, but great for home","Unless you carry a backpack for gear the large rocket blaster is only portable in a loose sense of the word, but it's super handy for cleaning lenses and bodies off at home after a day in the field."
4,"Good for cameras, kind of lame for computers","This is a great device for cleaning out your camera. I had a bit of crud inside my lens, and this did the trick! It's easy to hold and use, and has a clever little filter to keep dirty air from coming inside the bladder.However, it doesn't puff quite as hard as I hoped. I disagree with reviews that say it's a good substitute for canned air--it wasn't much help in dislodging the debris and cat hair that tends to accumulate in my laptop's keyboard, or dust from old baseboard crevices."
5,Powerful...,"This is a must-have item for people with DSLR's. In the event that dust enters the space between the lens and the sensor, this is the first line of defense for removing the dust.There are lots of pressurized air sources but most camera companies do not recommend anything with a propellant (e.g. ""Dust-Off"") because of the risk of freezing or damaging the sensor and nearby components.This tool provides enough pressure to remove dust. Naturally there can be stubborn dust (anything that is wet or sticky is going to be a problem no matter what you use...) but this will work very well for most things.It's small enough to keep in the camera bag for when it's needed. I suggest making sure the camera and lenses are free of dust before changing lenses and this is one way to achieve that!"
3,"Its OK, but will not clean everything.","This product should be tried before using the Arctic Butterfly (dry brush) or the wet swabs in cleaning the image sensor. Just make sure you turn your camera upside down and wait 5 seconds between each blow so that the dust falls out (you do not want to just blow the dust around). It cleaned my mirror after 10 pumps, however, it did not clean the one piece of dust I had on the image sensor. Of the blowers out there, this is the best one. I have read reviews of other brands out there where the blower is not cleaned and shoots little plastic parts out."
3,"it's so cute, oh why doesn't it work better?","i really bought this product based on its looks. it did not disappoint me in that area, because its super cute.it just does not move air anyway near what i need to clean my keyboard. its cute still and well made, which counts for something."
3,Meh...didn't seem to make much difference,"Bought it, tried it, wasn't too impressed by it. I know a lot of people swear by this item but I just don't see any difference after using it - my blobs are still right where they were before I used it. I suppose it could be that everyone says it works because on a psychological level they feel that by doing ""something"" then ""something"" must be happening. Like they say, if it feels good, then do it. It can't be doing any harm and it's cheap. No biggie either way."
2,not really sure it does much,"When it comes to cleaning the sensor on my D80, I'm a bit in a fog. I've tried several products, and none seem to work well. This does blast air across the sensor, but it doesn't seem to remove much. Photos looked the same after as before when I tried this product. I took my camera to a local shop and they blasted my sensor clean with the air pump. Sure, I can't take their hose into the field, but neither can I take this. Perhaps the blaster is better as a preventative."
3,function with a chuckle,"It's just a squeeze-bulb blower, not very powerful, but you can move some dust around with it, and the shape is way fun."
1,Overhyped,Overhyped. This product is soft rubber and no better than any cheap(er) blower. Very disappointed. This thing is worth $2
2,Seems a bit pricey for such a low tech product.,"Seems to me that I could have used a new, unused nasal syringe to blow a little air on the mirror and accomplish the same thing, but then I'm new at the photography thing... someone please explain to me why this is so superior???"
5,Why did I wait so long to get one of these! Works outstanding.,"I've been cleaning my sensor with the wet method, and it works pretty well, but sometimes it's hard to get that very last spec of dust using that method. I finally decided to buy an air blower and this one works great. Easy to hold, blasts a nice strong stream of air, and cleans off my sensor very well. My sensor hasn't been this clean since I first got my camera 3 years ago. I'll be using this quite often to keep things spot free, and shouldn't need to use the wet method nearly as often. This is a must have for any DSLR owner."
5,Excellent,"Love it! I don't like having to touch the lens glass much, so this works great for most situations. Also use it in the darkroom to clean my negatives. Awesome design, looks great, works perfectly well, everyone at my school wants one."
2,Better buy a brush instead of this Blower,"The item looks very big than I expected and does not fit in my camera bag. My friend bought a camera brush to clean the lens. After a trip to Florida, when we were cleaning the lenses (beach sand accumulated in the lens), this blower was of no use. But was able to do a better job with the brush. I might not recommend it"
4,I Like It but....,"This thing is great. It's just what I needed. Then, I started thinking about going through security at the airport. Hmmm... do I let them find it in the x-ray machine and try to explain while they're yelling *BOMB* and tackling me? Or, do I pull the ""Rocket"" out just before I take my shoes off, freaking everyone out before I can explain. I guess we'll see, since I have a trip to Europe planned in a couple of months. If I wind up in a Turkish prison, I may need someone to send me a toothbrush and my own bar of soap."
5,Absolutely worth every penny!,"So I bought this air blaster after receiving my D7000(used) and noticing dust specks in the viewfinder. Upon further examination I found them on the mirror. After doing some quick research I settled on the easiest method which was to dislodge dust by blowing air. Folks, I gotta tell you, this simple little tool is a godsend. It was extremely effective at removing every single visible dust particle off of that mirror. I no longer see any specks when looking into the viewfinder. So before you settle for other more complex cleaning methods including a sendoff to a service center(not complex, just costly), I suggest you invest your hard earned Hamilton and buy this little guy!"
4,Great Product,It works as expected... but if you have dust fused onto your camera sensor... that isn't coming off from air.
5,Just What I Needed,This shipped and I received it the very next day. Love that. Can't wait to put this to use and clean my dslr!
5,I'm glad I bought the BIGGEST one.,"The biggest one blows like crazy, I love it!! Of the 3 sizes, this is bang for your buck. Makes cleaning a lot easier and simpler. I use it for my SLR, lens, and point and shoot. I discovered that it also cleans my other gadgets well like iPod, iPhone, etc."
3,Works well but might not get you all the way there,"I bought this to try to get rid of lots of grey dust blobs on my sensor. It took several tries before I was satisfied with the results but it did do the job. There are still some small blobs at the edges if I shoot at F22, but let's face it, I never do. I was nervous about cleaning my own sensor but this was simple and didn't require me to touch it....I would probably let a pro handle it if I had to go to the swabs, etc. It's an essential item for your tool kit (too big for the camera bag) and one that most DSLR newbies probably don't know they need."
5,"Simple, and does it is job","Simple and does it is job as stated, may be a little bulky, but other than that perhaps the hardest part is convincing children that it is not a toy, or older people that it is not toilet cleaning equipment."
3,Rubber bulb syringe,"That's all this item is - very basic, although allegedly it has some kind of ""filter"" for the air as well. Can't tell without taking it apart - but it does the job - better than blowing on the lens and/or camera yourself.Warning - don't let your dog see it. Mine thinks it's a dog toy because it looks like one of those Kong toys, so she wants to get it every time I pull it out to use. I have to keep it put away up high in a closet or otherwise she would destroy it!"
5,good quality air-blower,"The Rocket Air-Blaster (large) does what it's supposed to do - blow dust and other small bits of matter off lenses and screens, etc. - and does it well (though it should go without saying that it does not have the force of canned air). When I'm not using it for my camera and camcorder lenses, I keep it near my desktop so I can use it on the keyboard, my eyeglasses, and the monitor (I use it on my iPad screen too). It's too big to fit inside my camera bags, but with holes on two of the four legs, it's easy to hang it from an outer part of a bag or wear around my neck. (The holes are large enough to accommodate 1/8 inch diameter cord or a typical leather boot lace.) With a finger covering the air-hole, pressing the bulb reveals the Rocket Air Blaster to be air tight where the nozzle inserts into the bulb, and everywhere else."
5,We take air for granted...,"Other than breathing, I never thought air would be this useful! I used to blow air out of my mouth to clean my laptop keyboard, camera lens, and inside of my camera. Boy, what was I thinking... this product makes my life a lot easier when cleaning electronics and it's very effective! That said this product should NOT be your only cleaning tool for your laptop, monitor, camera, and other electronics. I suggest buying a cleaning cloth and LensPen (for your camera). You will not regret buying this product. MUST HAVE if you are a photographer!"
4,Great but really big!,I bought this to help clean out some of the dust of my lenses. My only complaint is that it really is big. I have small hands and arthritis. I think I should have gotten the smaller version but this was a gold box deal so I just grabbed it when I saw it. It does do a good job of cleaning the dust off. I have also used it to help clean off things stuck on my keyboard. Overall it is a very versitale item that I will keep around.
5,Giotto rocket air blower,This thing really works. It saved my lens when I was shooting at Antelope Canyon where the wind was carrying with sand. A must have for outdoor photography.
3,eehhhhh,good for blowing out scanners and stuff because it's gentle and there is no risk of accidentally freezing something. Not as good for negatives... not enough force to blow off the tough dust.
5,Not Sure What this is Actually Used for,But damn does it get rid of the dust on my electronics well. The air pressure provided when you squeeze out the air is much greater than other rubber squeeze toys.
3,"Cool looking, but not as much air as I expected.","When I read about this product I was expecting some vortex of air what would sweep away everything on my desk. Okay, not really. But this doesn't seem to have the push it's advertised to have. Meh. It's okay for some light dust cleaning. Good thing I have an air-compressor."
4,A touch large but very useful,This is great for cleaning my lens on my DSLR are without touching it. Not a lot more to say but it is a worthwhile thing to own.
4,Great easy to use blaster,"I bought this blower thinking that it was smaller. This thing is BIG. I was hoping to fit it in my camera bag, but there is no room for it. Do not buy this one if you are looking for something small, buy the small one. This blaster is great, it is high quality and works well. The only thing I did not like about it was the size. This blaster is very reasonably priced and works as advertised."
5,"Not only cleans your camera, but replaces compressed air cans","This is excellent. It gets all but the most stuck on dust off your lens easily.It's also handy for cleaning Keyboards, Mice, and other air-cleaned items."
4,"So far, it works...","I just got this so I'm not sure how well it works once the sensor dust builds up badly, but for now, it works..."
3,"Decent, but not as good as stated","I see many people rated this like a super dust blaster, not really... I think its power just like the smaller version, no major difference. If your camera bag is small, just buy the smaller version. This large version is huge, and not very powerful. It can not even blow the small fiber on my camera lens filter (B+W MRC grade). I think the only time you really need this is when you want to clean your camera sensor, because the sensor is very fragile, you can not use the canned air blaster on it. When it comes to lens filter, canned air blaster is still the best way to get rid of dust, fiber, and some other stuff."
4,Handy if you have the room for it. Don't get it wet.,"This product works great. Just don't get the product wet, as the rubber starts to smell rather bad.If my current handblower broke, I wouldn't buy another.Tyler"
5,Cool as heck!,This thing works great and looks cool as heck!Everybody wants to touch it and play with it. Have no negative comments about this air blaster.
5,The only blower to own,"If you have a DSLR this thing is about as necessary as batteries & memory cards. Unless you've managed to get something gooey on your lens this will blow it off. I've not had to actually clean my sensors for a year...and my cameras have been everywhere from the middle of the Pacific (Hawaii & sailing) to Europe...and countless places in between. Just FYI, I ALWAYS change lenses with the sensor DOWN.My suggestion, check your sensor fairly often (so things can't get really stuck)...toss this blower into a ziplock bag (to keep it clean) and carry it with your camera always (so you'll actually use it BEFORE you need a full sensor cleaning.) Simple and very effective. Oh, and I AM a pro...and I've been shooting since the 70's...if that helps any. ;-)"
4,Good Piece of Decoration!,"The driftwood I received looked great in my 15 gallon freshwater tank. It's a two toned piece with a dark reddish side and a light yellowish side. The size is close the description. The wood sank to the bottom of the tank right away. I probably should of soak the piece in buck for a few days because it did leech a lot of tannins. However, I like the darker water in my tank. Overall, I think price is good compare to other suppliers."
2,neat piece but substantially smaller than described.,"I like malaysian driftwood, it sinks immediately and usually comes in interesting shapes and doesn't seem to discolor water as much as other driftwood. The piece I received fit that description, however the seller seacorals claims their medium pieces are 10-15"" long. I was expecting maybe 12"" or so. The piece I got is barely 8"" at its longest measurement, and doesn't take up much room in my 6 gallon tank. I am disappointed as this means I will have to buy more of it, since I wanted driftwood to be the focal piece. I will be ordering a large next time."
1,Disappointed,I was not able to sample any of the songs in the album for unknown reason(s)? Although I declined to have any cookies set I doubt this would be the reason. Maybe next time?
5,I Just Can't Put Her Books Down!,"I'm a relatively new GH fan. In fact, I only discovered her this past summer. OMG - talk about addiction -- I'm so far gone that I might never get back. Nonesuch was so good that I almost went blind trying to finish it in one weekend. I try to take breaks with contemporary lit in between her books - but its just not the same. Anyway, I challenge anyone to fine a better author dedicated to this time period. And, if you do, please let us all know about it. I grabbed up most of her books last year when they were on sale for her birthday. Thank goodness I have a cache.Hooked in Charlotte Hall,Hardt2"
1,Not her usual,"I've read her books before and have enjoyed them, but this one just wasn't as good. The verbage was too stilted. Some of the dialogue was funny but for the most part I got a headache from reading it and couldn't wait to finish the book."
5,Just excellent!,"I'm currently going through a phase of reading Georgette Heyer novels (great fun) and of the fifteen or so that I've read to date, this is definitely my favourite.Once again, Heyer provides a quiet heroine who wins the hero through her intelligence and manner, rather than astonishing beauty. In this book, the Astonishing Beauty gets her come-uppance.Waldo Hawkridge is perhaps rather less flawed than most human beings, but the gentle romance between him and Ancilla Trent is lovely to read.The usual cast of amusing characters, great language and amusing escapades makes this book well worth reading. I heartily recommend it."
2,ok,"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.I have read many GH books and, for me, this one was ok but not one of her better stories."
2,Monster Bop,"A nice little piece of halloween nostalgia. Some of it is a bit annoying at times. There are some gems though. Trax 6,15,26,27,29,and 30 are great. The gila monster, I was ateenage caveman and Frankie Frankenstein are a riot.....not worth the price though.....I recommend spook along with Zackerle....."
5,Kool kats and black cats!,"The cool thing about this disc (one of the cool things, anyway) is that it's way more than just a kooky novelty record. I mean, sure, it consists of nothing but obscure rockabilly tunes with b-movie lyrics and sound effects fit for a double feature, but what awesome songs these are! This is primo grease-soaked hillbilly blues shuffle boogie pop. It may not be as wild as, say, Jerry Lee Lewis at his most raucous, but the best tracks are cooler than Elvis and easily as wigged-out as the Cramps or the Sonics. The trash-cinema lyrics only contribute to the bizarre atmospherics, and help to make this one of the most relentlessly fun collections of music ever waxed. Good stuff!"
4,Repetitive but fine,"These all have the same sort of sound, and some of them are more on-point than others, but on the whole, one of the better Halloween CDs I have."
3,manufacturing defect,"""cd has a manufacturing defect. another customer noted the same thing. It plays fine up until track 9 (through track 17 or so) when the disc pops and skips. This was a brand new disc and appears to have not been mastered / pressed properly. Amazon quickly refunded my purchase though upon returning the cd."""
5,The first of four outstanding albums.,"2112 was definitely a step forward for the band, artistically and commercially, but AFTK was the first album in which everything held together perfectly. Neil Peart's lyrics reached the level he was hinting at in the previous 3 Rush albums, and on AFTK, his lyrics too all came together.Rush even had their first hit with ""Closer To the Heart,"" but the best songs on this album are the opening title track, the 11-minute epic Xanadu (arguably their greatest song/epic), and the frightening ""Cygnus X-1."" After this album, you want more Rush... well.. just pick up Hemispheres, Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures."
3,What Is So Special About This Album?,"Yes, I know it has Xanadu and Cygnus X-1 on it. But the sound of this disc is pure tin. I can't stand listening to it. Xanadu is better off being heard on Exit Stage Left about 4 yrs later during the Moving Pictures tour with The Trees right before it. Cygnus X-1 sounds great on the 3rd disc of Different Stages during the Kings tour. Cinderella Man rules...no problems there. Madrigal is easily the 2nd or 3rd worst Rush song ever recorded and written. Closer To The Heart is on 25 other albums and there are better versions. Then there is the title track...which again..sounds better on the Hammersmith disc of Different Stages.This disc had some great songs on it...but better versions are elsewhere."
3,Pretty cool.,"A Farewell to Kings isn't bad. There's some decent material throughout. The musicianship isn't disappointing. The tune that best represents the album is ""Closer to the Heart."" I think that ""Xanadu"" is pretty cool and interesting, also. The direction of this release is quite progressive. This isn't an album from Rush I listen to often, but it's still respectable in my book. Worth a listen."
5,A simply perfect album - it changed music!!,"It is without doubt one of the best albums by the best rock band of the last 20 years.Rush are, and have always been ahead of their time - AFTK sums this up with the spiritual Xanadu."
3,"Transitional,Next One Would Be Perfect","A Farewell To Kings was Rush working towards being a more progressive band,however it's not as strong,focused,or consistent as Hemispheres,which ranks with the classical masterpieces. Farewell has a lot of wasted space that reflects growing pains. I understand how 'Cygnus X-1' is the beginning of 'Hemispheres',but it's their most annoying,screechy piece ever.I always found Xanadu a little boring also. Really,only the title cut,'Cinderella Man', and 'Closer To The Heart'validate this album,which in my opinion is the weakest of their early period,though a prelude to something great."
4,good progressive rock from Rush,"This album is somewhat a ""concept"" album, with 2 major long themes, ""Xanadu"" and ""Cygnus X-1"". Both are great epics. In "" A Farewell to Kings"", the stops in the song makes it a little haphazard sounding. ""Closer to the Heart"" is a great song, it was the hit on the radio off of this album. ""Cinderella Man"" starts off shakey, but as the song progresses sounds good. Also ""Madrigal"" is good."
3,"Inconsistent, but worth getting if you like progressive rock","This is the record where Rush officially became a progressive rock band. And of all the Rush albums I have, this one has to be the least consistent, albeit not the least successful. If we ignore the first three records, this one has Rush's most successful (Xanadu) and least successful (Cygnus X-1) extended compositions. It also has one of their most memorable (Closer to the Heart) and one of their least memorable (Madrigal) songs. Add a pretty good opener (the title track) and another average track (Cinderella Man) and you have the definition of a three-star album. I am glad that I got this, because the good stuff makes it worth the price of admission. XANADU in particular is just marvelous and worthy of all the praise I've seen heaped upon it by Rush fans over the years. However, if you're new to Rush, any of the next three records (Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, or Moving Pictures) would be a better place to start."
5,Great Album!,"Great CD, recommended for hard core, die hard Rush fans. As a musician, I can always appreciate the arrangments and chord progressions as well as drum parts. Top notch musicianship!"
3,Still crazy afte rall these years,"What can be said about this album? Well, for me it was a little disappointing after my personal favourites - 'Caress of Steel' and '2112'. However, I can still remember vividly those times in my mid-late teens when I was continually playing 'air guitar 'to Xanadu (What am I talking about, I still do!). In my humble opinion this track is comparable with 2112. I guess FTK was even more special for me back then because the album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales."
3,Has Some Good Moments.,"I can't say that I'm a big fan of A Farewell to Kings. It probably doesn't help either that I'm more of a 1980's fan of Rush. Besides ""Closer to the Heart"" and ""Xanadu,"" I don't much care for this album. The other songs are good music, they just don't capture me. Not a bad album though."
1,Crushed Nuts,"This record's been around the block a couple of times and even a quick glance here at the other reviews tells me folks out there think the world of Rush but I gots to say first off the dude up front comes way too close to sounding like a cross between a chipmunk and a Muppet. And it's not just the alarming Marc Bolan on helium vocal delivery either, the lyrics themselves made me get up and rummage round for alternative footwear. Shoes really if you must know, very nearly brown ones. I honestly don't think I'm kidding about this--Hemispheres too I've bunged in the Toshiba more than once, well away from that unspeakable cover--so if we could somehow selectively expunge Geddy Lee's excruciatingly cartoonical bleating we might just have ourselves here a right crunchy bunch of Canuckleheads."
4,This album will drive you 'Closer to the Heart',"This is another great album from Rush. The best songs from this album are ""A Farewell to Kings"", ""Xanadu"", and ""Closer to the Heart."""
5,In my top 25 all time albums,"This a great cd. Especially A farewell to kings, xanadu, and closer to the heart...Rush doesn't get any better than these tunes. Enough said"
4,Kids Stuff,"Believe it or not, my 13 yr old son is on his drum kit listening to Xadadu on the headphones. And I thought this stuff was only for old white haired guys like me (and the rest of you who are into this stuff). Rock on - The CD is simply excellent."
1,"Enticing, Impractical Playhouse","We bought this playhouse for our daughter's B-day. Be warned! The product you see IS NOT really the product you get. Foremost, the table (with pedestal support) is form-fitted to mount on the inside, NOT the outside as shown! A huge chunk of playspace is now gone. Beyond this, most screw holes are missing and it is impossible to gain entry for a drill. This is most critical when an adult must secure the roof from the inside as the final step. Pushing the screw tip to bite into the plastic can cause the screw head to countersink, or worse! The whole product is poorly designed, but the ads are enticing!"
2,What happened to the brass?,"""Shout to the Lord 2"" can't hold a candle to the first cd. I had hoped for more of that amazing brass, but 2 has mostly noisy guitar backup. There's also less of Darlene Zschech, which is disappointing. I do not recommend ""Shout to the Lord 2"" and am sorry I bought it."
4,Great content,"Great instruction from a real pro. The wiz gets into great detail on loading the brush holding the brush and technique for curved and straight lines. My only complaint would be poor production value and lighting, but the know how the author instills make it well worth the money!"
4,Great travelers video,This is a great tourist video of the major cities & beaches in Cuba. The wildlife & countryside views are great.I use this video to show my students what Cuba is really like.The music accompaniment is great from Salsa to Son. The musican's range from amateur's to some of Cuba's most famous singers and groups.There is no talking in this video. It is just glimpses of the best spots to visit in Cuba to music.
5,Ethnographic value,"This movie, despite whatever people think of it, has an enormous value for several reasons, and one is that shows traditions and customs in forgotten areas of Mexico, that we need to witness since we don't live there, and some of them might no longer exist.Like ANIMAS TRUJANO, EL INDIO, etc. This movies are like time capsules and when we open them, we can actually watch the way some of those small town live and carry their traditions. What I loved most of this was the dialog in náhuatl.The portray of good vs. evil being represented by the Angels and the Devil, trans-ponds from the ''pastorela'' to the real life. The church and its hunger for power and control, the difference of opinion between the old and the young priests, everything has a reason and is well executed. Even racism peeks through the lines there..."
1,Boring ... Spanish class was far more interesting,insipid amateur movieI turned it off after 5 minutes to grab a taco which had far more bite & substance.Ole!;)
2,too much horn-tooting,"What could've been a good guide to modern indie film is bogged down by Pierson's relentless and self-serving tooting of his own horn. Who cares?!? What we really want is the inside story of all these independent films and filmmakers. Pierson seemed to lose track of who the stars of his book should be. I also found the author's writing and his overall knowledge of movies to be lacking. A much better book on the same broad topic is ""Celluloid Mavericks"" by Greg Merritt, which covers the entire history of American independent film from a much more literate and balanced perspective."
3,"A good history lesson, also good if a Kevin Smith fan...","this is a long history of indie films. One thing the reader must know before reading this: if you are not interested in the aspects of filmmaking or an indie film buff, DO NOT READ THIS! From an objective, weekend big-budget moviegoer point of view, this is VERY boring!!! the aspect i enjoyed best however were the discussions that the author and Kevin Smith (director of ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"", and ""Chasing Amy"") had. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of near-worthless drivel about movie festivals and how this guy financially backs many diverse films."
3,Definitely for Kevin Smith fans,"Although I'm a big fan of indie films, I found this book a bit dull. Not that I'm looking for a typical Hollywood put on the glitz and glamour type of book, but the book basically deals with how the author put together financing and got distribution for some indie films. It definitely could have been told in a more exciting way. The best thing about it is the interviews with Kevin Smith that are interspersed through the first half or so of the book. Then, they drop off, and I did as well. The author is definitely a huge fan of Kevin Smith, which is great, as there are a lot of Kevin's journal entries included about when Clerks was at Sundance. If you like Kevin Smith, this is a good read, if only for the interviews and the chapter about Clerks. If not, then well...you might like it, but it's a little dull. If you haven't seen Slacker, Go Fish, Roger and Me, Clerks, She's Gotta Have It, Amongst Friends, Reservoir Dogs, etc., then you might have a hard time as well."
3,Slides off chair to easy.,It works out okay but if you have a toddler that like to get in the chair theirselves it not so great. We have the taller kitchen chairs and when our 2yr old would try to get on it it would slip right off the chair. It needs some kind of grippers on bottom.
4,It works well,The best thing about this product is that it is VERY easy to clean. No hidden crevices. A little low for a short toddler but overall a very good product.
3,"Good fit, but not easy to wipe clean.","This seat is as described, and fits the chair and child fine. My main issue is that the seat has a textured surface were the child sits, and it's difficult to clean anything that isn't dry crumbs. I would have prefered a smooth surface, like the outside of the seat, so that it would be easy to wipe clean with cloth."
4,Great booster for a good price,"I purchased this booster for my 2.5 year old daughter and it's been a great transition from her counter clip seat. I was debating between this one and the Cooshee seat. This one has worked great and it's less expensive. The material is very durable and cleans easily. It does seem that the foam is denser than what the Cooshee seat is made from. The best feature is that there are no straps or clips to attach it to a seat so it's very easy to move from room to room as needed. Because its made of rubbery foam it won't slide on wooden or plastic seats so it's pretty safe. However, I use it on my upholstered kitchen chair too and it's less stable on fabric so beware if that's how you're looking to use it. All in all, I'm very satisfied though."
5,Great next step,This is a solid product. My daughter is so excited to sit in her Big Girl chair. It is easy to clean and stays put on the chair.
2,Disappointing booster seat,"The shape and size of this booster seat is perfect, but the material used to make it is awful. The booster seat has a spray-on plastic covering that peels like paint. I am constantly cleaning it off of my son and the chair the booster seat is on. The picture online was of a blue booster seat, but the booster seat that was sent to us was sage green. This was definitely not worth the money."
1,Buy the BabySmart Cooshee seat,"We have the mint colored Prince Lionheart soft booster seat. After 18 months of use with our middle child this product has developed cracks around the rear edge of the seat. While the booster is still useable, I'm guessing it will be completely unusable in about 6 months. I'm not sure if the cracks are because of the material used in creating the seat or the the seat design. The seat is open on the bottom with ribs or cross bars to support the seat made from the same plastic material as the seat. The seat is cracking where there is no material reinforcement.Our older child has used the BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat for 4+ year and it is still going strong. The BabySmart Cooshee Booster has a solid base. I'm not how it's designed internally, but it's held up very well."
5,Great seat for little butts!,"We got this for our daughter who is 20 months. She was to the point she disliked the highchair and wanted to always sit in the dining room chairs. This seat is perfect! Gives her enough height to sit comfortably at the table and it wipes clean very easily! There are no straps to secure to chair nor does it have straps to keep her in - this is just what we were looking for! It will travel easily and no annoying straps to try and keep clean of food messes. I would highly recommend to any parent looking for a nice looking, yet safe and easy chair for the active toddler!"
2,Stains and hard to clean,"We've had this booster for a couple years now, and I just can't stand it anymore. It just looks terrible! It is impossible to keep clean because it's seat surface is porous and textured. It absorbs stains and is difficult to wipe up messes completely because it isn't smooth. Also, it shifts easily when my toddler tries to climb in himself, causing many near falls. We also have a Fisher Price plastic booster and a Cooshie booster that I much prefer. Definitely wish I hadn't bought this one, and will replace it soon."
3,good seat,"I have both the Cooshee booster and this one and I have to say I like the Cooshee better. They're both good - they do the job of boostering the kid closer to their food, but the Cooshee has a smooth surface that was easy to clean. The Lionheart has a texture on the seat part (where food is most likely to be dropped) that has never come completely clean for me. I've used a scrub brush and BonAmi, but it still looks discolored. The Cooshee I can just wipe off with a rag and everything comes off. This is my only complaint with the Lionheart chair.My first child used the Cooshee and now my second child is using it. We've had no problems - and we have recently started taking it to plays/movies so she can see better."
4,Serves its purpose,"I got this booster seat for my son because he really wanted to sit at the table with us versus his high chair. We were actually boosting him up on a really big cookbook for a while, and I've got to admit, it couldn't have been comfortable for him. Anyways, this seat is similar in material to the Bumbo, and it's as simple as can be. It serves its purpose. Not sure if this is a plus or minus, but it does prevent my 2 year old from being able to get in and out of the chair without our help."
5,Great seat!,My daughter loves it! Very skid proof! I would recommend this product to anyone! Especially if you have a toddler who likes to be independent!
5,Perfect,"Love this booster seat! My 3 1/2 grand-daughter can finally sit at the table with the rest of us! It puts her at just the right height. So easy to wipe clean, and, does not slide on chair. I highly recommend!"
5,This is a good sturdy seat!,Used for transition from a high chair to sitting with the grown-ups. This seat is thick and easy to use and clean! Very happy I got this instead of some of the other types. My granddaughter is tall for her age and the back is just right for. She appears to like it and uses it willingly.
3,Does the job but not easy to clean,"This seat does its job for sure and my daughter loves her booster but even scrubbing food off with a soapy sponge is quite a challenge. I guess if you dont mind stains and scrubbing, this is a wonderful booster. However, I would try to find one you could just wipe clean after meals and save the extra work."
4,Nice booster,"Seat is comfortable and offers just the right amount of extra ""boost"" for my 3 year old to eat comfortably at the table with the family. I only wish it came in some more neutral colors."
4,prince lionheart soft booster seat,The seat is very sturdy and cleans up very easy. It's also comfy for my Grandchildren and doesn't damage my furniture or my cars leather interior (when used on occasion). My only complaint was waiting over two weeks for delivery.
4,"Great seat, wish it had a strap.",This works perfectly for us. I only wish it had some kindof strap so I.didn't have to worry about it moving around.
4,Booster seat,This product arrived on time and as expected. It is a good product and would recommend it to others to use.
2,Impossible to clean and color is inaccurate,"This booster seemed like a good substitute for the MIA cooshee boosters that we have loved so much. Unfortunately, the seat surface has an odd, deep texture and it is IMPOSSIBLE to wipe clean. I have to SCRUB and SCRUB and SCRUB with a washcloth after every use and still have a very hard time wiping up any spills, even when wiping up immediately. Very VERY poor planning on the manufacturers part. Toddlers and preschoolers are messy eaters!Also, the ""mint"" green is more like lime green, so disappointed there too.Only plus is that the underside has four little ""feet"" which eliminates damage done to your wooden dining chairs like the cooshee booster did, but I would still take the cooshee booster any day if it was still available."
1,Buy the Cooshee brand - these are very hard to clean,I purchased four of these for my daycare and regret it. They are very hard to clean because the seat has a texture that food sticks in. There's no just wiping these down. You have to spray them down and really scrub. I have owned the Cooshee brand as well and they are far superior. I wish I would have spent the extra few dollars for Cooshees.
4,Just What We Needed!,"The only reason I didn't give this product five stars was because of the color. Otherwise, it's GREAT! Easy to clean, durable, lightweight.We needed a booster seat for our 3-year-old who was tending to get out of his chair more and more frequently. In addition to giving him more height at the table (and making him more comfortable), it makes it more difficult for him to slide off of the wooden chair, thus helping him stay put at the table longer.Other users' comments helped me choose this booster over another, similar, product (which some users said wasn't as durable).We are very happy with this purchase."
4,Good seat for price,"The Prince Lionheart soft booster seat is a good buy for the price. I was concerned about my son trying to climb out (or falling out) because of the lack of straps, but that has not been an issue; he seems pretty secure in it. Although the color isn't my first choice, the fact that it's easy to clean, lightweight, and made in Canada make up for that."
5,Lionheart -prince of boosters,This product makes meal time comfortable for my toddler and enjoyable for my family. Durable and functional- great deal for the price!
4,"Soft Booster Seat: well made, works great.","This booster seat works great. I have a 4 year old who was too ""mature"" for the fisher price booster at this point and wanted to sit in a big girl chair. There is no odor, it washes easily and stays on the seat very well. It boosts her right up to the table, and is the perfect height. It's a little pricey, which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Although, I think you get what you pay for in the end. Very pleased and would recommend to others."
3,impossible to keep clean,Thought this would be perfect for my petite 3 y/o. Unfortunately it is too short for our dining room chairs and can slip out the back of the chair. It also stains easily and even the Mr. Clean magic erasers are no match for it.
5,Great seat,"I was worried about getting this vs. the more expensive Cushee, but am glad I didn't fork out the extra money. This seat is very durable, doesn't tip over (no matter how weirdly my son climbs in), cleans easily and looks good too. Highly recommended."
4,Not exactly what I needed,"It is sturdy, easy to clean and seems comfy. However, I am using this with a 2 1/2 year old. He is a climber and will quickly climb out taking food with him. I used a belt strapped around the chair for a while to keep him in his seat. I finally gave up and got another booster for him---one with seat straps. Now he stays put when that is important.This booster will probably be my choice in a few years. He does use it around the house to sit in and ""read."" It is a great size for his little legs."
5,Nice booster seat for my 4 year old.,"Easy to place on the chair( I have a basic Windsor dining chair), does NOT fall off even with my toddler jumping around. Handles abuse very well. Has four bumps on the bottom for traction. Easy to clean (I take it to the sink and wash away with a sponge. Color does NOT fade and is true.I have two, one in orange for my 6 year old and the Mint for my 4 year old. The orange one has held up very well (have had it longer) and I expect the same from this one too. Great product."
2,Dipped in some type of 'coating',"I thought I had read enough reviews before clicking the 'buy' button...maybe I missed the one that happened to mention that this very nice-sized cutting board is not a raw wood board, it has been dipped (or painted) with a varnish type of coating. This means that every time you chop/cut on this board, slivers of the coating will be coming off into your food--This 'coating' should be mentioned and defined in the description. I thought others would want to know."
5,"Mundial Solid Wood Cutting Board, Medium","Excellent quality, and extremely useful with the deep ridge along the perimeter to catch juices. It also has a cut that makes it very easy to pick the product up from the kitchen counter. Excellent utilitarian size."
2,WOBBLY,"I ordered this, AND had it replaced, and both boards wobbled ridiculously. The rubber feet are uneven, and this drives me nuts! I am going to buy a different cutting board."
3,All cut up...... already :(,I got this a month or so ago and have been using it almost daily. I liked it's size and weight when it arrived. It is pretty hefty! Also there was a nice finish to the board. But that was quickly ruined and now my whole board is covered in cuts. I oil it now regularly and it is fine. No splitting or anything... But I just wish that I could find a tougher board...
3,just ok.,"The board is attractive, but the wood is pretty soft & cuts easily. The board stays in place while you work. A good Thing. I like the size. not too big... not too small. Overall its just ok."
5,Great for learning body parts,"Personally, this is one of the Baby Einsteins I enjoy the most. My 13-month-old loves it too. Great for pointing out the child's body parts and learning to name them."
4,Educational,"I have to admit the Baby Einstein movies are a little brain-numbing for adults, but after a recommendation from a friend I purchased this one. I don't much care to watch it but my 17-month old, who won't sit still for 1 minute, sits through this video. After only watching it three times she knew all of the body parts they go through in this movie. I'd highly recommend it. Even my 5-year old seems to like it."
4,From Head to Toe,"There things I like about this video outweigh the things I don't like, so all in all, I find this an entertaining video for my 9 month old. He is still young to really understand the concept of what's being talked about, but he loves the puppet shows in this particular video. I love that it teaches the various body parts which will be a great educational tape when he does get a few months older. The only thing I don't like, again are the kids - some of them are cute, but they just sit or stand there, at least they point to the body part that's being discussed (occaissionaly). I don't like the artist drawing either - that seems like a waste of time. Most of the images used are captivating enough for my little guy and they do pertain to the discussion."
4,Good overall,"My 10 month old has been hooked on Baby Einstein since he was about 4 months old! His first was Bach. Then Mozart, Beethoven, Mc Donald, and now Da Vinci. Each of them has one part that I usually have to fast forward through because they make him fidgety. However, I use these videos to get him to sit still and eat. I sit him in his highchair and for the 25 minutes (on average) the videos are on, he's completely mesmerized and opens his mouth without any fidgeting except with this particular video he fidgets a little when they draw the body parts. Otherwise, it's a great sing-along for parents too, and a good teaching mechanism for the body parts."
1,Boring!,My baby finds the video so boring. He won't sit to watch it because it doesn't have a way to keep his attention. They should have had music cuz those are the only types of videos he likes! If your looking for a good educational movie that keeps your baby's attention buy a Barney movie.
3,"The baby likes it, but I see it a little boring","My baby likes this DVD, she's 1 year old but I'm not sure how long she will continue enjoying it. I personally see it boring, but I guess is not made for me (as an audience). It's made for babies.You see in all the DVD the parts of the body. e.g. 'eyes' and many, many presentations of eyes (from persons, cartoons, animals, puppets, etc."
1,good until it broke,My son really enjoyed watching this DVD though not as much as his Baby Noah DVD from Baby Einstein. It was just unfortunate that we were only able to watch it a few times before the DVD stopped working.
1,Another Baby Einstein video that doesn't impress me,"Featured in this dvd are eyes, ears, mouth, nose, face, hands and feet. Each segment begins the same way by showing and speaking the word in 3 languages; English, Spanish and French. So for face it is ""face, la cara, le visage"". Then they show all kinds of faces on people, animals, toys, etc. Then the hand of an artist draws a face and then there is a puppet segment. Afterwards they do another body part and it follows the same routine. They sing ""Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes"". Again, as with the other Baby Einstein dvd's I have viewed, I am just not impressed. It's just boring. Baby Neptune, Galileo, Newton & Numbers Nursery are the only ones that I'd recommend. Read all of my reviews."
2,Worst Release Yet,"I have most of the Baby Einstein videos. The last 2 releases are the worst work yet. The latest video, Da Vinci looks like they spend 2 days on it, mastered it, and shipped it out. The bonus materials are a joke. The Puppet show, is a total of 3 x 10 second clips. The DVD plays repeated company branded intros with more plugs to their web site. The original videos were good, and now, it's obvious that it's just a cash cow for Disney/Julie Aigner-Clark, so the value has gone down the tubes. If you are new to these videos, start with the first ones like Mozart, where they actually cared about baby development. I would not recommend buying this new."
3,Calvin's Mother,"My 7th month old has responded well to all the Baby Einstein videos except this one. He may be a little young, but this video does not have as many puppets as some of the other videos. I am not sure he will like it even when he is older. Some of the videos he loves are Baby Van Gogh, Neighborhood Animals, and Baby Mozart. I would suggest trying some of the other videos."
2,Not the greatest,"My 19-month old son is a big Baby Einstein fan, but this particular video does not hold his attention. I have been increasingly dissatisfied with the videos since the Baby Einstein Co. sold out to Disney, and I noticed it with this one especially. It seems much more like TV than the earlier videos. The images move too quickly, and the puppets don't have as much character. I'm disappointed!"
4,Wonderful for very young toddlers,"I notice that some of the video's detractors claim that it does not hold their children's attention. I think that perhaps they are expecting it to entertain too old of a child. I think this video is great for babies between 12 and 16 months of age.My 12-month old received it for her birthday and loves it! She points to her own body parts and even yells out at the screen, ""Eye!"" and ""Ear!"" No matter whatever else is going on around her, she stops dead in her tracks to watch this video. She loves looking at the up-close shots of different eyes, ears, noses, hands, feet, etc. However, I do not expect that it will hold her interest much beyond 18 months."
2,Just sold ours on eBay,"My son got this as a Christmas gift last year along with Baby Neptune (which he loves). The first time we popped the DVD in he cried. For some reason he didn't like the monkey puppets at all and even after one year (he just turned two) he still doesn't like it. Otherwise it seems like a good video to introduce the basic body parts, but the monkey puppets were a no-go."
4,Cute DVD,"I have all the Baby Einstein DVD's for my 26 month old son. This DVD held his attention and he moves along the the ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" song. This is the classic format, with the addition of French and English. Thank goodness the original songs like the one that appeared in Baby Newton have gone to the wayside."
2,Won't watch it,My son will not watch this Baby Einstein dvd. He doesn't like the drawing aspect. On one instance-it was drawing a face-and let's just be honest...babies don't have the attention span to watch something like that.He didn't last but about 2 minutes-and that was with me trying to be chatty about it while he watched. Not one of the best Baby Einstein dvd's.
5,A must have,My 9 month old daughter is totally & completely mesmerized by this DVD. She warm up to Baby EInstein from the first day!!!Her favorite part is the Head Shoulders Knees & Toes sing-a-long and the puppet shows as well .... You won't be disappointed!!!!
5,Interactive Fun,"My 16 month old has been watching (and enjoying) Baby Einstein Videos since she was 3 months. This one is one of her current favorites. She laughs outloud during a couple of the puppet skits and has been quickly learning her eyes, ears and nose. Since watching this video she is constantly pointing at all of our noses and ears and she says ""eyse"" out loud. She doesn't like the part where they draw the body parts, but for the most part she really enjoys this video."
4,"Dumb to Me but Daughter Loves, Loves, Loves It!","When I watched this, it was so stupid I thought my daughter would hate it. I have no idea why, but she absolutely loves it. It's the only thing she wants to watch in the car. She's 14 months, though, so we'll see how long it lasts!"
4,Baby Da Vinci,"Of the six Baby Einstein DVDs that I own (the others being Mozart, Bach, Galileo, Monet, and Van Gogh) this one is arguably the most educational. It correlates pictures of various body parts (eyes, ears, nose, mouth, face, hands, feet) with the appropriate word in 3 languages, and my 10-month old daughter enjoys watching it. The puppet work is alright, although not as good as the puppet work in Baby Monet. In the bonus material, the story about the monkey getting a bath is a nice touch. Unfortunately, there is a part on the Spanish track when the woman says ""el agua es tibia"", instead of ""el agua está tibia"". This is a blatant error in Spanish; the difference between the verbs ""ser"" and ""estar"" is one of the first things taught in the first year of high school Spanish. Indeed, the entire story is a very poor translation of the English track; it sounds as if someone who doesn't know Spanish translated each word individually using a dictionary."
2,momma of super active boy,"i got this for my son when he was around 11 months because he loved this other baby einstein dvd that is for sounds I think. well he hates this one. he is super busy and this has lots of parts that drag in it, and he really loves the cartoon monkey and bee but the show more of real life pics in this which he thinks is boring. this is probably fine for those babies that are pretty content with just anything, but if you have a little explorer I would skip this one."
5,Perfect Video!!!,"My Baby has loved this video since he was 2 months old, and now that he's 6 months old he get very excited when I put it on for him. He enjoys the puppets the most he smiles and laughs whenever they come on the TV. I recommend it!"
2,NO LANGUAGE in this dvd,"I was surprised to find that the dvd is pretty much without any spoken language. After reading the description, with reference to language tracks, I expected to find words spoken along with the classical music. That is not the case. Puppets introduce each section of the dvd. They say ""eye"" one time and show a picture of an eye. Then there is a long track of classical music accompanied by images of eyes. No repetition of the word. This is the case with each body part.I interact with my toddler as we watch dvds, so I'm able to provide the verbal stimulation, but I was disappointed that we didn't get to hear other voices saying the word."
4,Great Video,"My 14 month old daughter has been a fan of the Baby Einstein videos for almost a year now. The very first one was Baby Beehtoven which captured her attention at the age of 3 months then we progressed into Baby Mozart, Baby Wordsworth and now she just recently got this video as a gift and just loves it. The monkeys and Elephants are some of her favorites as is the Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes song. Before the video she was able to point to her hands, feet, and belly but now she also knows nose, ears, mouth, and head. I would reccommend the videos to anyone not only as a learning tool but also just something fun for their children to watch."
5,My son loves it!,"My son has been enthralled by this video for the past ten months. He is now 17 months old and still sits and watches this one! Now that he is more mobile, there are some great parts for him to get involved when prompted by me. I would definitely recommend this one."
3,"A little too stiff, disappointing","One of the things about playing music is knowing the style and being comfortable in it. The Metropole Orchestra obviously has played music like this before, but they are just a little too stiff in these arrangements. The running passages in ""Powerhouse"" actually sound labored. The Warner studio musicians in the forties, knew how to lean into the rhythms, and what to accent, etc. Obviously these are not Carl Stalling's reworkings, but the rhythmic figures are there.Some music simply requires that you know the idiom (Chicago Symphony under Reiner or Solti, playing Bartok, as opposed to Karajan and Berlin).I went back to the ""Carl Stalling Project""."
2,Not for advanced users or enterprise administrators,"Of the 310 pages of text in this book only about 50 pages have information about useful things to do to protect yourself from Viruses. The rest is defining malicious code, basic computer info (what is FAT16 and FAT32), what the FBI is doing about cyberhackers, etc. There is a pretty good chapter on social engineering, but most of the book would only be useful for people new to systems administration and in a small shop. There are only two pages about network firewalls - not much for a book with ""network"" in the title.A number of known worms are described but there is no strategy proposed for detecting or stopping them. There is 1 page about responding to events and only 3 pages about securing web servers.The information in this book is no longer timely or comprehensive."
3,Wow,"I really enoyed reading this book because it gave me the opportunity to write the following: Don't waste your time on this ineptly written and factually flawed collection of patronizing nonsense. The grammatically incorrect title, (""Trojans"" is an adjective - though here describing nothing), is just the first of thousands of errors and clumsy observations. But don't take my word for it - it's plain to see this author knows very little about a lot of things [...]. A must read for anyone!"
3,Beautiful sink,This sink is beautiful! The only reason for the 3-star is because of the plastic part for the side plug. That broke immediately and I have yet to request a replacement.
1,Aptly Titled,"Avoid at all costs. Streisand at her most obnoxious, weaker material than a Nick-At-Nite ""Facts Of Life"" marathon. Wear a life preserver if you have to sit through it because it starts sinking right away."
1,for pete's sake,This movie was funny when I was young and it had first come out but upon watching it now it was not at enjoying. I found it boring.
3,For God's Sake!,"Okay, what were the film folks thinking with regard to this picture? The commentary by the film's director was fun; the film in two formats was nice; but after almost 20 years, there is nothing new to this piece. The only upside is being able to burn on your personal CD player the opening title song, ""For Pete's Sake"" sung by Streisand. Where is the creative genius' behind these releases?"
3,a must see for babs fans & those who love early 70s flicks.,"I have been looking for this video everywhere. I saw the movie years ago and have fond memories of the slap-stick humor of this and other early Streisand movies. (ie: What's up Doc? ) Maybe its the storyline in which young people, in love, struggle with day to day life in the big city and come upon a winfall fortune that enables them to make their dreams come true, riding off into the sunset to live happily ever after....pure escapism at its best...I loved it. HOW ABOUT A SEQUEL? ...but not one that takes itself too seriously, rather, one that is retro to the early, carefree, funny and very entertaining Streisand movies."
4,Don't get this for the recovering alcoholic in your life!,"365 days of wines! Merlots, Ports, Sparkling whites. A wine lovers dream all year long.Unfortunately I purchased this calendar for my Uncle Louie for his birthday. Uncle Louie is only a few days into a 12-step Alnon program and my gift has accidently sparked a 3 day binge in return. To date (no pun intended), my Aunt Violet still isn't speaking to me, and poor Uncle Louie is dealing with chirosis of the liver.Regardless, if vino is keno with you, then a marvelous purchase awaits!"
3,New Revision available that supports 2GB+ SD,"Belkin now has the Revision 3 (three) of the product available which supports 2GB SD Cards. Check if you have a little sticker on the bottom of your cardreader.I contacted technical support if the product number and asked ""guess what my problem is"", Support guessed right and assumed its the 2 GB SD problem and offered an exchange free of charge.I give Belkin a big plus for the hassle free exchange, however a similar big minus for selling outdated products in the first place and hoping no one notices. Therefor, three stars."
5,"Awesome card reader, but 2GB not supported","I've been using this card reader for 2 years. I use it daily and enjoy it very much. I bought a 2GB SD card for my Treo and unfortunately this card reader will not work with it. The 2GB card works in my Treo and on my Compaq Laptop (Texas Instruments chipset). So I called Belkin tech support and the rep was very familiar with this type of call. He said there is nothing he can do for me at this time, Belkin products do not support 2GB yet. Oh well."
5,Belkin Card Reader,I needed a reader for SmartMedia cards and this one works perfectly. Just stick the card in and it shows up in your folders correctly identified. It also reads all the other cards I use just as easily. Usb port hook up is as simple as you can have also.
1,It can't read anything over 1GB,"If you want to use any card over 1GB with a card reader, don't get this one!In no literature does it say that it can't read anything over 1GB, but it can't. Buyer beware!I do highly recommend Verbatim 15 in 1. It reads my 2GB MiniSD just fine."
3,Limited SD card size,"After trying to get a 2GB SD card to read, I got this from Tech Support:Thank you for contacting Belkin Technical Support. Unfortunately our media readers do not support media over 1GIG for compact flash.Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see that anywhere in the sales literature.Other than that, this is a fantastic (and fast) device."
1,Truly awful support,"I bought this item and installed it in my Windows 2000 PC. Before the install completed I got a Blue Screen of Death. Regardless of attempts to resolve the problem, the BSDs continued.Upon contacting Belkin technical support I was first told, without any troubleshooting whatsoever, that the item was no good and needed replacement. Unfortunately, they were out and had no replacements. I should call them back in a month or two. When I protested, I was referred to ""level 2"" technical support. Level 2 technical support at least asked me what the problem was but when I told them they said that it worked at their office so nothing must be wrong. Sorry.I won't be buying from Belkin again."
1,Crap,It's not a movie. It's a couple of people with a camcorder. And it's not funny or profound. Can't believe I wasted this part of my life.
2,Keyword: mediocre,"This semi-documentary was a disappointment due largely to its mediocre production. Some of the rarer episodes are of historical interest but overall the selections are not that great and some have been badly edited. Plus, there's an unusually obnoxious and distracting i.d. ""bug"" always on-screen. There is some good news, though--the companion ""Greatest Hits"" DVD is much better in all respects."
3,A little Exemre Thought Next to last Vol.,Plot :Sliver Surfer steal the Infinty stones From Thaons And Becomes The Dark Surfer right in front Of the super hero squad.Than He Starts Destroying The Univese Than Teleports The Hero Squad Across Time Space And Realtiy. It Has 7 Episodes. Fate of destiny And 6 Against Infinity (6 Against Infinity Is What HappensTo the squddies After Telported. It Takes up 6 episodes. ) Have I gave Enoght Deatils Yet?
5,"A bit dated now, but still very funny!","I think this was published during the Carter Administration or thereabouts. I was a young budgeteer working in DC at the time, where politics is everything. Some of the references to what were then ""current events"" will be lost on today's audiences, but much of it is timeless, perceptive, and quite clever. MacNelly's illustrations of ""Qualms"", ""Staggering Deficit"", ""Dilemma"" and many others are amazing; just as full of sly commentary as the written descriptions. The ""Budgetary Shortfall"", a stumbling bird with the plaintive call of ""Uh-oh"", is etched in my permanent memory.I think it's time for an updated edition! So many easy targets in today's political lexicon..."
1,HARD TO FOLLOW AND UNORGANIZED,"I purchased this book for an online course. Each new subject that the author would talk about would be scattered throughout the chapter instead of being in the near paragraphs to follow. I found myself shifting from one page to many pages away just to piece together what the subject was about. I found it to be unorganized. The book was very dry and could have been worded better. By the way the software it comes with is not all that. It's just a review with cheap graphics. Please by this book used, it's not worth your full dollar (even if it doesn't come with the CD's, there are web sites that can coach you with some pre-tests-provided by the book)"
3,Clear and Sensible,"Because I work with underserved students and their college counselors, I bought this book to do research. It's admirably organized and clear, avoiding jargon-laden edu-speak in favor of level-headed observations about how to prepare students for college. The first part was most relevant for me as a college counselor, but the recommendations regarding curriculum sequences and preparation are excellent. A good book for school and department heads as they review their own curricula, especially if they want to ensure a good transition to college for their graduates."
1,unresponsibility,That book did not reach me and I sent a message to seller about it; but I did not get a reply until now.
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT, IT HAS NO TASTE, I HAVE ORDERED OTHER SUGARFREE PEANUT BRITTLE FROM OTHER PLACES, IE., SEE'S CANDY, ETC AND THEY ARE SOOOO MUCH BETTER. I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY GOOD MONEY. THIS STUFF IS GOING INTO THE WASTE BIN."
2,Typical New Age Music,"What this music has to do with creativeity is beyond me. It's nice, background typical new age music. Nothing special. I've heard better."
4,Good Food!,"This is a classic! Includes good basic recipes as well as interesting ones that for the most part are not difficult. Nicely divided by types, i.e. soups, poultry, desserts, etc. I've used this cook book for years and when a friend was visiting she decided she had to have it. Found it in the second hand books so was grateful it was available."
3,Find an editor,"Somewhere among the 800 pages of this tome is a great 250-page biography. Mr. Sewall has assembled a massively detailed account of ED's life. I know presenting myriad detail of a subject's life is the biographer's method for removing themselves from the reader's relationship and experience of the subject, but I find this current trend of unleashing 800 to 1200 page biographies very taxing on the general reader. Although I wasn't completely disappointed in Mr. Sewall's biography, I was hoping for a tighter depiction of ED's life. I'm a general reader, not an academician. I was simply looking for an account of ED's life that would help me better understand her sublime poetry. This book delivered too much matter and not enough essence for me. However, the final chapter of the book entitled ""The Poet"" was very enlightening and poignantly written. This last chapter deserves 5 stars, the rest of the book 2."
2,Muddy waters,"I was surprised to find this book so highly rated by other reviewers. I found it frustrating--Mr. Sewell spends a great deal of time and effort telling about different theories for events in Emily Dickinson's life, and then telling the reader that ""I don't think that can be true"". However, he never seemed to give any of his own answers to this enigmatic life. This is the first biography I have read about ED, and I come away greatly puzzled . . ."

5,Classic biography of Emily Dickinson,Richard Sewall concieves of E.D.'s life as intrinsic to her poetry. Her relationships with family and friends provide context for her amazing output.
2,Double Fault,"Waintrup, the son of a rabbi, spent fifteen years as a teaching tennis as pro at a New England country club. He tries to tell the story of his life in this book that's a mixed up collection of anecdotes, biography, letters and actual tennis advice. However, he doesn't know if he wants to be a stand-up comedian or a writer as he tells the story. The book fails to come together successfully. He totally missed his shots with this book."
4,Great glove for price,"This was one of few all black gloves I could find for my other other half. He loves it - but does say it gets a bit warm (hello, it's a glove worn outside in the sun--lol). Don't know if it has really improved his game, but he likes it!"
2,Good but Weak,"Outstanding system, much less effort to exert, but weak plastic. Handle just broke after 2 months of use. Wait for the steel version."
3,U get what you pay for.....,"When I first plugged in the LCD, I noticed that there were 3 non workable pixels. The screen was very bright and it took me awhile to get used to it after I adjusted to the right color. Once again, if you just want a LCD for text and surf the net, this is the way to go for a 350:1. But for graphic and video editing...don't bother with this..go with Viewsonic or Samsung....."
2,"Kogi 17"" LCD monitor did not last 2 yrs.","I bought a Kogi 17"" LCD monitor in January 2003. It was great while it worked, but it died December 2005."
4,"Durable, but some issues","I have one of these Kogi monitors. It's nice and large and I like the fact that it has built-in speakers. I don't listen to music on my computer, so I don't need the best set of speakers and these do fine for what I need. The less clutter on my desk, the better.My problems came when I upgraded my system from XP to Vista. The computer wouldn't boot up. This was also a problem on my Linux system. I realized it was the monitor, switched out the monitor and everything was fine.For a long time, I didn't use this monitor, until I googled my problem and found that I could use this on my newer computer by changing the screen resolution. That did the trick. I can now use this monitor once more.The large screen size is a plus. What a relief for my aging eyes. However, it is not widescreen, which seems to be the preferred format nowadays.This monitor is more than a few years old and still going strong. I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,"It's ok, for the price","The first one I got had a dead pixel. I brought it back to CompUSA immediately, and got a new one that's worked fine ever since -- for over 2 years now with my KVM switch. I've only had a few issues with it:1) When switching computers on my KVM switch, I sometimes getting a fuzzy screen and have to have it auto-adjust (forgot the correct word) the display again in the setupmenu.2) It doesn't do text modes well, they get cut off. I called them and they said they don't support text modes.3) You can't manually resize or adjust the display area of the screen like on most monitors."
4,Very nice monitor,"I have had my new monitor for about a week now and I must say I agree with some of the other reviews.1. I do have two pixels that do not work.2. The sound is just what you would expect, not great but it gets you by.3. Very bright screen, I have had some trouble finding what I like, however, it's just great for web surfing and just about anything else you want to do.4. Monitor let's you adjust just about everything, even things I don't know what they do yet.5. Small footprint, I can use it anywhere and can take it with me to other locations. It's no laptop with respect to mobility, however, its far better in quality of picture than any laptop you will ever see.It's a fine monitor, however in my case there are two pixels that do not work correctly and I will have to see whether I want to send it back for repair/replacement or not. It's a real pain in the neck to do so."
4,Godd but not their best,Maria Azevedo is the voice which sets Battery apart from other industrial bands. Her Voice is show cased in Aftermath and Distance in a near sublime way. NV on the other hand includes lots of standard distorted male vocals and Maria's voice is not handled as well as there later CD. If you like this band go for it otherwise try Aftermath first.
1,Feminist need to grow up! Stop crying and start being responsible!,"Yet another book on the feminist perspective, narcissistic feminist seem to love books like this. We need a real woman's perspective - you know, a perspective where men aren't blamed for everything and women take responsibility for the decisions they make."
5,Installed in 2004 elantra,"I've had this on my 2004 elantra since the first year I had the car. With a set of Rihno plastic ramps, oil changes are quick. I had no failures with it in 6 years, and it is still installed in my car.I've noticed some people saying it drains slow, the flow will increase significantly if you remove the oil filler cap which vents the air out. Also I have some oil put on the orange tube before inserting into the valve so when you screw it onto the car the orange hose spins more freely without hindering the threading into the valve."
4,Good product with some shortcomings,"As stated by other reviews, the oil will drain slower when you use a Fram Sure Drain. Also, I really do not like the quality of the hose attachment (if you turn too much while draining, it has a tendency to come off the fitting, despite having a hose clip. That bypasses the whole purpose of the hose to begin with). With thoses short comings, I still like the Sure Drain. For one, I like that I do not have to replace crush rings at every oil change.( also you avoid possibly stipping the inner threads by over tightening) I had a Sure Drain on my older Mitsubishi (for over 5 years and 170k miles before trading it in)) and never had a drop of oil in the brass cover. The seal works and works well, period.I address the slow draining by setting the hose into the oil receptacle and walking away for at least 10 minutes. The brass fitting and cover are well made. When installed, you will not have any oil running down your arms any more."
5,I'm looking for another one for my motor home,I bought this system for my pick up truck a long time ago. It works perfectly. Yes you have to make sure you do not allow the hose to slip off the brass fitting. It's never been a problem. I place the other end of the hose into a 2 gallon plastic gasoline can. No mess and I am already packaged to take to the recycle center. No oil splattering on pavement or parts of the vehicle. I'm looking for one for my new motor home.
3,"Good, But Don't Expect it to Last","I'm ordering my third freeze alarm, the first two lasted me two years each. The first one came from my furnace provider, the second and third from Amazon. I love this alarm and I use it to monitor a cottage that is 150 miles away as we'll as to turn the heat up when we go there. Works well when they work but ours have had a 2 year fail rate. Since our cottage is very rural and we lose power whenever the wind blows, I have this plugged into a battery backup / surge protector. That way the short power outages of 5-10 minutes do not trigger an alarm. I love this unit, I just wish it was made better."
5,A good guardian,"The owners manual must be read from cover to cover for proper setup. Once that is done, it is easy to program the Freeze Alarm to suit your needs. Works like a charm."
3,freeze alarm,"ive used this product for two years now. it has worked awsome. the only reason i have given it three stars is it lasted around two years. for the money i would have thought it would have lasted longer. but i will give them another chance, it has worked so well. i use it to turn on the heat in my cabin. its so nice to have it warm when you get there. i just bought another unit. i hope it lasts."
2,Not Compatible with VoIP Phone,"Great concept with the ability to remotely toggle thermostats (and temperature settings)with a phone. However, after two units, neither were able to work with my Ooma based VoIP phone system. Everything worked fine calling out to the designated numbers during an alarm condition, but I was never able to call into the unit and access the main menu. This is a pricey unit and I would have expected that this type of bug would have been worked out. Their technical assistance was not very helpful who fell back on the standard line ""you must have noise in your telephone line."""
5,Great product,Works great. I own a vacation home in Maine and it is peace of mind to know that I can call my telephone number and know what the temperature is in the house.
4,FA-D2 Delux Freeze Alarm Review,I had an earlier version that lasted 10 years without a problem. Then one day it stopped working for no apparent reason. I still think it's a great product and bought a replacement.
5,Great Freeze Alarm,"I have a vaction home and was looking for a new Freeze Alarm.I pick the Deluxe Freeze since you can call it and check the current temp.This is a key feature since you need to know if the house is warming up after the repair man ""fixed it"". My old alarm would stay it alarm until the room temp was above the set point. The problem was you had to wait hours not knowing if the heat was back on or if the oil tank gelled again.The set-up was easy and the quality seems good!I plan to use the remote switch funtion, to provide for a remote warm funtion. This feature does require another Thermostat and some wiring work.Seems like Freeze Alarm to get!"
4,Great Product so far!,"Have had the products: Deluxe Alarm,water sensor,3 motion sensors. System has worked flawlessly so far. Purchased over 1 year ago. My fingers are crossed."
4,Freeze Alarm #FA-D2,"Product set-up instructions were easy to follow, albeit a bit complex.Only negative is the product exterior design. Device aesthetics make one want to hide in a closet or storage space, not in view. However, to view indicator lights, the device should be in a visible location."
1,UNSAFE!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS. It bunches up and you will slip and fall. Unless you are planning to kill someone by accidental bath fall, don't buy!"
1,Not a good design,"Bought this at a brick and morter, what a waste of money! It does not stick, the few suction cups (not NEARLY enough of them either) will not hold the mat down. I thought the textured surface might be more helpful for my DH with a broken leg, but there's no way I'd let him use this.Don't waste your money, find a bath mat that works instead. This one's an accident waiting to happen."
2,Non-gripping Griptex,"Good tub coverage and its easy on the feet, but it simply doesn't grip the bottom of the tub. The suction cups are way too small to be effective, and the bathmat buckles and shifts out of place. A great idea that need to be worked on!"
1,Slides around -- the least safe bathmat I've ever used,"It has a very low traction on the bottom compared to any other bath mats I've used. It usually it slides around when I step on a particular part for the first time each day. For your own safety, don't buy this -- it's not much of an improvement over a slippery tub."
2,bath mat,"It does not stick to the tub and moves arounnd as you move, it leaves you feeling very unstable."
1,Slipping Problem,"I purchased this mat mainly due to it's size since it is difficult to find larger sized mats. With the first few uses, I found the cushioning of the mat under my feet to be great. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before I started to slip when making any kind of move on the mat. This is a very unsafe product especially for those of us who are older. Perhaps if there were more suction cups, the mat would still be in use in my home instead of in the garbage."
2,1 Pro vs. 3 Cons,"The good thing about this mat is the cushioned comfort for your feet.And now for the negatives:1. The cushioning doesn't hold up very long and the mat becomes flat within two weeks of regular daily bathing.2. The 54 suction cups do NOT hold the mat securely in place. NOT AT ALL. It slides around when you're taking a shower and floats to the top of the water when you're taking a bath.3. Even with regular washings in the washing machine, the mat still mildews and then you're stuck with nasty looking stains.When the mat is brand new, it's incredibly comfortable (but still dangerous) and then everything goes downhill from there."
2,Perfect for Baby but not Everyday Use...,"I purchased this bath mat mainly for my little one who just started using the ""big girl"" tub, however, even when it's used just for her it doesn't stay in place. It's super cushy and perfect for her while we're watching but if you're looking for something to use everyday I'd look elsewhere."
