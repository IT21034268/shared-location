4,Bear does it again.,"Great dvd's and great value from Amazon.com. I love the way Bear doesn't hold back on his opinions of bush tucker (i.e. ""it tastes like a prawn, full of sand, that's been left out for about a month, with cheese""), worth watching the DVD's just for that :o)"
4,Love Bear...,"Great for entertainment. I would probably rather die than do most of the stuff he does, however."
5,great,"LOVE THE SHOW ON TV AND LOVE THE DVDS. IT IS NICE TO WATCH SOMETHING I WATCH WHEN I HOME. I AM DEPLOYED TO IRAQ,"
3,Man Vs. Reality,Discovery Channel is planing to have some real wilderness survival experts on in the 2010 season. I will believe it when I see it.
3,pleasant mix for pop lovers,"Reasonable mix of hits from the past... sometimes a few songs are added to the confuse people.... i personally like 8 of the songs on this dvd...a few others are rated passable....The sound quality is good on various tracks specially the British band Chumbawamba... Tubthumping...The great song with lyrics ""whisky drink"" brings back old memmories of pubs in England blasting this great oldie out... on a saturday night...This dvd is ok if you like listen to a general mix of different sounds..."
3,"A nice, if uneven, collection of videos.","Don't let my three star review fool you: I do like this DVD, it's just an odd collection. It has some classic 80's clips on it, which is the main reason why I bought it. But then, it goes from 1985 to one song from 1990, then a bunch from 1997! Very weird. I wish they would have done one for the 80's and another for the 90's. And the K-Ci & JoJo clip, while a nice song, seems very out of place on this package. My guess is that they tried to license some better stuff, but this is all they could get. The mastering is nice, as are the menus. Some good bio info on each band, although I did notice a few mistakes, which always drives me crazy! It's not hard to properly research this stuff, people! However, I'm still glad I bought it."
4,Great Product. Just what I needed.,I don't know why back massagers in this configuration are so hard to find. It seems that more body scrub companies should produce and sell these near the body scrub/wash isle. This product works great for applying body scrub to your back in the shower. It has an easy to grip rubber handle and is long enough to get between the shoulder blades and lower (I'm fairly tall). I've been using it now for a couple of months and recommend it to anyone who wants to wash their back but doesn't want to use a brush!
3,Not as sturdy as before,I've used this product for many years and it has served me well however the last order was a bit of a disappointment.The handle is not as sturdy as it used to be and broke at the point where the wood meets the rubber grip piece after 2 months of use. The mesh is also not as thick as it used to be.Overall wish the manufacturers hadn't messed with what was once an awesome product!!
2,Backlight problem?,"I decided to buy the TJ35 because I owned a SJ20 and I loved it. It was slow but it was dependable. However, I'm pretty disappointed with the TJ35 because the backlight went out after a week and it's currently being serviced at Sony. I thought I got a lemon but after reading many reviews (on multiple websites), it seems that everyone is having the same problem with the TJ35 and this backlight issue seems to be a design flaw.The pluses are that it's fast and its slim profile makes it easy to hold and operate. When the backlight did work the colors were nice and bright with excellent contrast. However, despite the good aspects, the backlight issue is a serious problem that really hurts the 35. In retrospect I think I should have bought a Tungsten E."
1,Backlight Hell,"The old saying ""misery likes compay"" has never been more true. I'm somewhat comforted by reading about others who have also expressed extreme frustration over the backlight issue with this PDA. Frankly, I loved it. It is smaller than my first PDA (a Handspring Visor) and had an awesome screen. It works like a charm with Outlook at work. A real nice machine. Then the backlight went out. And they fixed it. Then it went out again. And they fixed it. Then the light went out. And they aren't returning my e-mails. I'm officially done with Sony. I should have gone wth my gut that said up front, ""don't buy a Sony product"" but the guy at Best Buy assured me that my past bad experiences with Sony products were history. Live and learn. Go with your gut. Don't buy Sony."
2,Ditto with the backlight,"When I got the TJ35, I was absolutely in love with it! Great applications and nice slim look! The definition was great and pictures that I downloaded came though with beautiful color. HOWEVER, within 10 months my backlight went out (which you need in order to view the color pictures). Unfortunately the place where I bought it was unable to fix it and now I have to look into other PDA's. Too bad. I really did like the clie's I've owned. If I were you I'd bypass this one."
2,Sony CLIE PEG-TJ35/U from Tech for Less,"I recently returned my reboxed Sony CLIE PEG-TJ35/U from Tech for Less. PalmOS 5.1 caused some of my repair tracking programs to not work so I returned it within four days. Tech for Less charges a 20% restocking fee; fair enough but I asked to defer that until I can research which older Palm OS will work.It seems that PalmOS 4.1 works with my program but now Tech For Less says that I had to take store credit at the time so no deal on credit the $19 that they charged for restocking fee towards a older Sony Clie PEG-T665C.Oh well, they loose and another seller on Amazon .com got my business."
1,fragile product poor support from Sony,"I bought mine in Jan. 2004 at $300 Canadian.The protective cover on mine wouldn't stay on. Kept coming off in my pocket. 3 months later the Clie fell to the floor and sustained a small crack in the touch screen. End of ClieCost of repair would of been $200 Canadian.I maintain if the protective cover stayed on as supposed to, it probably wouldn't have broken.Sony didn't support their product. End of Sony in my future."
2,"Pretty, Pretty pricey too","This item is good to look at and the applications are great. It is pretty and pretty pricey too. The backlight is a constant problem with it and has to be sent back to the factory to be repaired. I have the Tungsten E and my wife has Sony Clie&#65533; PEG-TJ35. She is sorry that she got it and now wants a Tungsten. Well we all make mistakes, but is still a nice Handsheld. I think my Tungsten gives me more value for my money. The extra money you save you can afford to buy a 128 MB Card and listen to some cool tunes."
1,Broke in less than a month,"The best I can say about this product is it worked well...for 3 weeks. Then the backlight suddenly stopped working. Since it is a color screen, it is useless without the backlight. I went looking on the net and found many other folks had this same problem with theirs. I was just relieved it decided to die before the 30 day return policy expired. I can say that Amazon was prompt in refunding my money.I returned this model and purchased the Palm Tungsten T3. It was more expensive but a much better PDA. Hope this review helps in your decision."
5,Good-tasting food quick,"As part of the increasingly available food that is not full of additives and artificial pretend ingredients which are cheaper than the real thing, Annie's line of pasta and cheese are standouts. The taste is great, the ease of preparation is good. Can be used with lots of fresh vegetables to make a real feast."
1,Simply VILE!,"I've never tasted jet fuel, but this mac n cheese is how I imagine it would taste. The whole premise of Annie's Homegrown is that it is natural. Let's face it; if it comes from a box it's not natural. The cheese in a foil package is reminiscent of Velveeta. If the kids (2 of the 3 like it) want it in a pinch great, but it's not crossing my lips EVER again. And comparing it to Kraft, there's not much difference in the nutrition department. Both Kraft and Annie's have similar calories, protein, fiber, sodium etc. Conclusion, it's not worth the expense or assault on your taste buds."
5,Delicious!,"I LOVE Annie's mac'n'cheese! They are so much healthier than the kraft schloch, doesn't have that processed after taste, and my boys love it. When I make kraft, we always have leftovers, but when I make Annie's, there is never enough! Definitely worth the extra cost, and on Amazon you get a huge savings over buying it in the store. I like all the flavors."
2,Many pieces rusted after only 6 months use,"As much as I love this pattern and Wallace Flatware in general, I wouldn't recommend buying it. I purchased this pattern 6 months ago and several pieces are rusting. I have treated the flatware well, but somehow it is rusting. Maybe I recieved a bad lot of the flatware, but it certainly shouldn't be rusting, particularly after only 6 months use. You may want to select a different pattern or give Wallace a call before your purchase."
3,"Much, but not all, is dream","3 1/2Although their changing sound would alienate some long-timers, for the most part the orchestral pop that swirls around AID feels like a focused stream of fragile beauty. Yes there are a few duds and the singer certainly milks the vulnerability of his approach a little too closely at points, but when the band's flow aligns with the production properly, there is a surefire cue of musical magic, and while all tracks are certainly not selflessly brilliant as say, Tides of the Moon (ie: the opposite in feel to a clumsy romanticism of the opener), the album comes packed with it's share of MR gems."
3,"a bit of a let down, but thats relative","Deserter's songs may have been this band's peak. While not a waste, this album is not terribly cohesive, and is downright annoying at times. That said, ""nite & fog"" and ""the dark is rising"" are fantastic, trippy, and downright pretty songs. If you're unfamiliar with the band, the singer/guitarist/genius has a quirky, whiny, heliumy (allow me to invent a word) voice that will either grow on you or you'll forever think he's kidding (wayne coyne of the flaming lips is the closest comparison, or maybe neil young after getting kicked in the jimmies). For casual fans, pass on this, for diehards you probably already have this, and are cursing my blasphemous words."
4,Big Bill's #22 of 2001,"4.25 Stars. Mercury Rev certainly has come a long way since their debut back 1992 (that has mixed results I guess). The noise blasts of old has now been replaced with orchestrations and symphonies. However, All is Dream kind of rocks it up a tad more than Deserter's Songs. Incorporating guitar antics similar to those of Godspeed You Black Emperor works really well with the orchestrations and Johnathon Donahue's vocals. I like this CD better than Deserter's Songs, but not quite as much as Boces. Best tracks are Lincoln's Eyes, You're My Queen, and Spiders and Flies."
1,Deserter's Song's this isn't.,"what a pretencious piece of drivel. jonathan has finally lost his mind. Just look at the picture of him on the inside cover. i think that in trying to be too artistic, he's lost site of what's really important...the music. The highlights are ""a drop in time"" and ""the dark is rising"", the others are flat and droning. Lyrically, not nearly as good his previous efforts like ""Opus 40"" and ""endlessly"". Otherwise, I'm a huge fan of their stuff. Go get Deserter's Songs,Boces and Yerself is Steam but not See You on the Other Side, that stinks too."
2,Kermit with Grasshopper,"Yes, the melodies are layered and rich...but I cannot recommend a group whose lead singer sounds like an ill Muppet and whose songs are written by an overweight little man named Grasshopper. Nite and Fog (the incorrect spelling is not ""creative"", nor is it charming) is an inspired piece...but the rest of the album is a Jim Henson-meets-Crowded House earsore. Worth burning or borrowing, but not buying. Want mellow melody? Try belle & sebastian...."
2,Not as good,"Buy it beacuse it fits along the side of the rest of your Rev albums.Whoever compares these guys to The Flaming Lips ever again, deserve to be taken to hell and eaten by tiny, little ants for eternity."
1,"My god, this guy's voice is awful!!","No doubt the music is great. Actually, the music is exceptional. But it boggles my mind as to why the lead singer is allowed to sing lead. HE IS AWFUL. His voice is garbage, his pronunciation is exaggerated. I give the music 5 stars, and the singer -4 stars..."
1,Good god what horrible lyrics.,"I loved Deserter's Songs, especially the first three songs, but All is Dream is terrible and overblown. I have repeatedly tried to give it a second, third , fourth.... chance but the lyrics are so horrific and trite that I cannot change my initial opinion about this album. Actually I'm starting to wonder if I was mistaken about Deserter's Songs. Plus Jonathan Donahue should realize his falsetto/high vocals sound like a tone deaf person singing along to a Buffalo Springfield era Neil Young song."
3,"Pretty good, some flaws","Musically, this record is extraordinary. The textures are lush, the melodies are hook-laden, and the neo-psychedelic instrumentation is seductive. But the falsetto vocals can get irritating, and are, quite frankly, unoriginal. One day, we're gonna find out that the Flaming Lips, Grandaddy, Sparklehorse, and Mercury Rev are all the same band."
1,Sonic Hogwash,"On All Is Dream, Mercury Rev follow the most lovely song they've recorded, the aching orchestral ""The Dark Is Rising"", with 45 minutes of sonic hogwash. This is not news. Since 1991's Yerself Is Steam (still their best), Mercury Rev have been purveying the new progressive rock with disparate results - the listless Boces, the spacey funk of See You On the Other Side, the over-praised Americana of Deserter's Songs. All Is Dream is nominally better than Deserter's Songs - sonics reach out and grab you (the melancholy undertow of ""Tides of the Moon""; the strings and glockenspiel of ""A Drop in Time""), but the weirdness of the arrangements never feels organic, just odd. At this point, all this should sound effortless. Most of the time on All Is Dream, you can hear the strain as they reach for the next bizarre effect. Successful eccentricity isn't an affectation; it's a natural state of being."
1,same as Video Collection 1989-1998?,"I ordered this hoping it was something new. However, what I received was ""Sarah McLachlan Video Collection 1989-1998""."
3,"""1989 ~ 1998""","I bought this DVD because I like ""Sweet Surrender"" a lot. Having watched this video collection, I realized her early songs are not really my taste. Her voice became so mature and beautiful now, it makes a big contrast to her old style. The worst thing is, some of the very old videos are in pretty bad quality, just like VHS or worse. I like her new videos a lot better, they are in pretty decent DVD quality(""Building a mistery"", ""Sweet Surrender"", ""Adia""). I wish this DVD playing sequence was ""1998 ~ 1989"", instead of ""1989 ~ 1998""."
4,A music video journey through time exploring this 1 artist,"A great collection. Interesting to watch and listen to the quality changes between the earlier and later videos (which are shown in historical order). Even her looks change dramatically over time. Besides enjoying better quality audio, you also see better and better visual effects and creativity in the videos as a whole. Sarah seems to work up to ""singing in the nude"", video by video as if she were gaining confidence in herself and working up the ""nerve"" to actually do it. She has pretty interesting and deep lyrics which the videos enhance very well. Worth the price."
3,Older & more expensive version of newer release.,This DVD was re-released in December 2000 and is now available on Amazon for less. The only difference is that the newer release (which is currently mis-titled as Video Collection 1999) comes in a hard plastic keepcase. The following link should show you the newer DVD.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000541X5
4,Great video collection,"This a great compilation of Sarah's videos. The only complaints I had is that it is only 2 channel dolby digital and the song navigation was hard to deal with. Other than that, its good quality. Just wish we could see more concert DVD's like James Taylor's ""Live at the Beacon Theater"". We can only hope Sarah McLachlan has one in the works."
5,AWESOME!! SARAH McLACHLAN RULZ!!!!!!!!!!,"If u love Sarah like me, then you'll love this video. U get all of her music videos from her earlier days from her first CD Touch, to her 1994 phenomenon Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. And videos from Solace as well. Even if you're not a Sarah fan, u will be after seeing this video and seeing how wonderful she really is."
1,This book re-states the obvious...,"If you're looking for some insightful running suggestions in SF, avoid this book. [In my opinion anyone] could have written this book from 3,000 miles away by reading tourist brochures and looking at maps. The suggested routes are obvious, uninspired suggestions that anybody who is moderately interested in running in or around SF ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT. A huge portion of the book is taken up by content on races... I presume this was done to give it some bulk.This book did absolutely nothing for my SF running intelligence."
2,SF Running,"It would have been useful to know there are a limited number of runs actually in San Francisco listed in this guide. While all the running trails listed are in the Bay Area, many of them are in the East Bay and South Bay, so the title is misleading. Otherwise, the maps and trail descriptions are good and the book is very useful."
2,could have been better,the fight scenes are awsome in this movie but it could have been alot better they have some A list actors in this film for it to be dull as it is the plot sucked in a way but the best part of the film was the end the dimestration of the diffrent weapons used.....
3,"Umm, What?","The fights in this movie were pretty decent, and there were a lot of them. I understand what the plot is about (various factions trying to eliminate a former kung fu school leader), but the translation to the screen is confusing to say the least! I was only barely able to follow this movie. There are too many characters and their motives/alliances are unlear. Oh, I suppose it is all in there, but I am not sure this is a movie of the caliber of Swordsman II where it is worth it to make sense of things.The video quality is pretty poor, and the dubbing is about average (for a kung fu movie anyway)."
4,Eye catching movie from the opening bell,This Movie would have got a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the middle. A little bit too much talking. The begining & end make up for it though in this old school classic. Most movies with Gordon Liu in are great. This one is no exception. He is a monk & he has a epic battle with one of the Masters in this movie. The end fight is the reason they named the movie. The evil master fights the good with 18 different weapons. A must see For true kung fu fans.
4,Delightful,"Reading this fun cookbook brought back alot of childhood memories of Samantha , Serena , Endora , Uncle Arthur , the whole gang. I found it quite fun and entertaining with silly titles and quotes from the show. If you are any kind of a Bewitched fan then this is a good book for your collection of memorabilia.I wish Bewitched could have gone on forever [it still does with reruns from Nick at Night] as we need constant reminders of the magic that we all behold no matter how big or small."
2,"Good for the Anecdotes, If Not the Recipes","First, my biggest beef with this cookbook is that it has no index. (What kind of cookbook has no index??) Second, it bears little actual relevance to the show, other than the anecdotal trivia that Kasey Rogers (AKA Louise Tate) supplies, having been a former cast member.If you are a Bewitched collector, this may be of value to you, but as a cookbook it is a great disappointment. Much as I love the show, I ended up getting rid of my copy of this book, simply because it was worthless in my kitchen, and I am not a collector of the show's memorabilia. It collected dust once I had read through it, and I don't miss it on my bookshelf."
5,Nosotros Somos Dios,"I am teaching Spanish V literature this year, and I needed another copy of this play. It arrived in good condition and is the same edition as the other copies that I have."
3,Only for Black Flag completists,"This was a decent EP, but to me the weakest Black Flag release. Only for completists."
4,Not the Best Black Flag ...,"... but still well worth listening to. These are apparently outtakes from a previous recording session, and it definitely seems like it. That said, it's still an interesting release.Many people thought Black Flag was at its best when it was at its rawest, which is pre-Rollins. There is some merit to that, but Rollins brought something to the band that made it shine. It was an artistic bent, a skewed philosophy, and lots of introspection. It was raw poetry, and that's something that can't easily be duplicated. This release is the blunter side of the Black Flag sword. It won't make anyone into a fan, but it also shouldn't turn people away ... except those who never liked Rollins in the first place."
5,A nice surprise,"I originally wanted a wooden utensil holder but my husband ordered this one. At the beginning I was a little worried that it might not look good with my kitchen, but it came with a surprise. It is such a large utensil that can hold all of my wooden utensils. It looks fashionable and neat, nicely painted, well designed, easy to clean. This was my first Le Creuset purchase and I just fell in love with their products ever since."
5,I LOVE IT!,"Arrived fast, in one piece, and unchipped! (my local UPS man appears to have untreated anger issues...) I love the color, the size is impressive without hogging all my counter space and the weight (with or without utensils) of the crock will never tip over even in my most hurried grab for a spoon! Tell your friends, it's a keeper and can easily multitask as a wine chiller or even bakeware!"
3,It looks nice but transfers heat,"I like the look of this ""utensil crock"" but it has one major flaw: it transfers (or, rather, conducts) heat.I have a gas stove, and I have this utensil pot on the stove to carry utensils. I live in small-ish NYC apartment and don't have much storage space. As such, I have to maximize the use of my counter space.As my stove or oven heats up, the crock gets untouchably hot as well. That is a problem for me and dangerous for kids (and myself).If you're not going to put this on a heated surface and like its look, though, I would recommend purchasing it."
2,Le Creuset Stoneware - Cracked,"This was shipped as a gift for my parents. Item was shipped promptly, but they received it with some pieces broken."
3,too big,Ordered this for a utensil holder. Way too big for me. Makes a great plant holder. Love the color.
5,le creuset 2 3/4 quart utensil crock,I purchased this utensil crock because I got tired of looking for utensils in my kitchen drawer. I wanted a colorful one that was sturdy and functional. The color is much prettier than the picture and it's very well made. It is large but the width and height allows large utensils to fit nicely in it.
4,Excellent story telling...,"Although this film was written and directed by the person it portrayed, it is still a work of genius. The cast, the soundtrack, the cinematography were all perfectly worked into the film. Yes this movie shows us how rough childhood is for some people, but it also shows that hope and the friendships we make will carry us through any burden. Hands down, the best movie I saw or will see this year."
5,Acting at it's best!!!!,"""Guide"" is a coming of age story about Dito Montiel. This is his true story of life in Queens. How his life changed, developed, and was moved by the people who were and are in his life. This movie can not be explained to regular words, but trust me when I say YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! I watched it and I am forever inspired and in awe of his wisdom.The casting is great! Initially I wanted to see it because watching Robert Downey Jr. (Mature beauty) and Channing Tatum (Young Beauty) is a dream come true, but after seeing it all the way through it was a well-played wonderful cast. Shia did a wonderful job lead the cast through the life of Dito. They had a chemistry that I saw on-scene and in the outtakes was noticable. The movie itself was done wonderfully!! I really enjoyed it.****Warning***** Lots of cursing and violence, but very true to life stories."
1,The Worst Ever!,"Loser!If I could have rated this movie NO STARS I would have done it.This is the most depressing and debasing movie EVER!99% of the women/girls are SKANKS! 99% of the men/boys are LOWLIFES!It is over-the-top in vulgarity! There are enough F-bombs to decimate Hiroshima!The only actor in the film worth watching was Dianne Wiest.There is nothing happy in the film whatsoever! It starts at the bottom and spirals downward until the end.The title is exceedingly misleading!Don't buy it! Don't rent it! And when it comes on TV, don't watch it!It is a complete waste of time! You have been warned!"
3,"Wrong ""great expectations""","Well, that's what I felt about this movie: Great expectations went unsatisfied. I was expecting maybe too much from this movie after having been told about it, and also Robert J. Downey was a definite plus for me. But, well, I was very bored. 3 stars mainly because the acting was good. The story didn't impress me: Too few things, too long movie."
3,HMMMM Its ok?!?,"Hey everyone, Well I saw this movie and it wasnt bad...Robert Downey Jr., Rosario Dawson, Channing Tatum, Shai Labeouf.... Were pretty good in this movie..(SIDE NOTE) I didnt like Channings uses of the N WORD!!! Not cool!! However, I still believe the movie is worth watching...really intense.. And Channing is still sooooooo Hot!!! LOVE YOU!!!So.. I give this movie 3 stars.. because.. some parts were hard for me to watch!!ThanksIts your Review from the Jay Guy"
2,Please rent it before you buy it!,"I completely wasted my money on this junk film. I probably won't ever watch it again. You can tell it's an indie film, especially after watching it. The only thing I like about the movie is the fact that Shia LaBeouf is in it. This movie is very disturbing and really rubs you the wrong way. Lots of violence, very vulgar scenes and language. Definitely not a family movie. Please don't be stupid like me and buy this movie just because some ppl gave it good ratings. Actually go and rent it from a video store first and make your own judgements about it."
3,LIKE THE FILM'S CHARACTERS...THIS FILM GOES NOWHERE!,"I like these types of films and this film has some excellent performances. Diane Wiest is fantastic in her role as the loving mother and everyone else is on cue in this depressing ""coming of age"" movie. Life in the innner city looks bleak and hopeless for the characters in this film. It's biggest problem is it really doesn't go anywhere. It's worth watching, but I have seen better films dealing with the same subject. It's a good movie, but not great."
3,"not bad, needs more R.D. Jr, less of the young cats","Pretty good movie. Too much of the younger characters and not enough of the older Downy Jr. Nonetheless, they're not going to remake the movie so as it is, pretty good if you are looking for something to watch."
3,Brooklyn. New York-a very traditional view,"With no explanations banned de facto recently, 4/25/12, from communicating with readers directly, I correct this review in accordance with a tomato-public message:""A story of then Queens (Brooklyn landscapes were shown) is so traditional for liking to hear of N.Y.C. as a very cradle of the American crime and Mafia only: teens divided into gangs near-killing (and were killing) each other while one escaped own murdering by running away to California.On return, years after, he is rejected by parents and friends alive.Not my cap of tea.""One would be only happy not to meet these kids on the street whether in Queens, Brooklyn or even Times Sq.Thank you, public tomatos."
4,It's not that bad!,"Unlike the other reviewer I find this model a vast improvement over the Palm 505. I like the size and the display!The lack of a docking cradle was a surprise but you get an adapter for hot syncing and power. A cradle seems to run 20-30 so it does not bother me that much. The stylus does take some getting use to. I didn't find grafetti 2 much of a change.Don't use mail so I can't judge on that. All other programs worked just fine!As to the claim of a case should have been included. I have only had Palms and they didn't come with a ""decent"" case.The cover is way better then that cheasy one that palm used to give out.I like it though I probably would have picked up the TJ35 if I had thought this out.I am not disappointed with this purchase!Oh do keep the box because you need a serial number to get the refund!!!!!! I tossed mine! :("
5,Absolutely super.. beautiful and entertaining,"I agree with othere that this version is unconventional, but also hasten to point out that the performers are really great. I do believe that Mozart would have been pleased, even if a bit dismayed by the razor-wire and submachine guns. It is really nice to see talented young performers do Mozart well and having fun doing it. I have a conventional version and clearly and strongly prefer this one."
5,Perfection,"I recently saw Don Giovanni at DAR Constitution Hall. This started my quest for 5.1 mastered Mozart opera's on DVD. The Abduction from the Seraglio is brilliantly rendered. The audio is magnificient, and the DTS track a definite plus. I only wish the costumes did not include jeans and field coats, but that is but a minor distraction. The music is brilliant, skillfully moving from masculine fullness to feminine slenderness as required. Christine Schafer's vocals are mindblowing, and, to steal a quote from Amadeus' Maestro Salieri, ""like fireworks zipping up and down at a fair"". He jealously referred to them as ""ghastly scales"" but I politely disagree. Stunning. A definite must have."
2,fact checkers needed,"I have only just begun planning my trip to Argentina, and I have been very frustrated with the incorrect information presented in this book. Many of the phone unmbers are missing a numeral and, after quite a bit of research, I found a key website didn't work because the book left out one of its suffixes. I'm going out to buy a different book."
5,Works as expected,"I got this cable by mistake, since if you need to connect your video card with VGA output to monitor with DVI-A input, you need similar product ""DVI-A Male to HD15 Male Video Cable"" rather than this cable.In any case, I end up using this as an extension cable for my KVM switch and the cable performs as it should, picture quality is great and this cable is not causing any degradation of quality."
3,The Studio that drips Blood!,"All Day Entertainment has just released the colorful DVD compilation of 53 Hammer Film trailers. Despite the variance in quality, this one is a treat for the true fan. As a homage to Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, get set for 1 1/2 hours of gory fun. All 4 Hammer Mummy films are previewed. Christopher Lee appeared in 15 movies as Count Dracula, 7 were released by Hammer. All 7 trailers appear here. Of note is a one-reel short promoting ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"". Gothic cinema expert Gary Smith is on the audio commentary track. As noted, ""The Horror of Hammer"" suffers from some archival quality problems. The trailer for ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" is faded and flat. ""The Man Who Could Cheat Death"" suffers serious sound loop problems. The video picture is 7 to 10 seconds behind the audio. All Day Entertainment's web site promotes ""Prehistoric Women"" as one of the epics to be seen, however, on the DVD, it is not to be found."
2,not half as good as it should be,"When I heard about this DVD I got excited, over 50 original hammer trailers with audio commentary(!) The Audio and picture quality of the trailers is awful but that is to be expected. What I cant get over is the dreadful production quality of the commenatay track complete with background hiss. Informative as it is, the commentary is pretty much unlistenable, which is unfortunate as it's the main reason I bought the DVD."
3,Vietnam Vet Is some kind of Hero,"This movie is quite good for several reasons, based on the book it is a moving and intelligent treatment of released POW vet Eddie Kellar as played by Richard Pryor after several-years and how he tries to re-adjust to civilian life back home the pomp and media frenzy that ensue then the hardships,his wife is in love with another man,he has a daughter he doesnt know,his mother is in a nursing home from a stroke and hes broke. The Army wont pay his back-money and he falls for his only friend left in the world a sympathetic highpriced prostitute Toni(Margot Kidder),the film then changes gear into some hilarious attempt's by Eddie to turn around his luck by turning to crime. Comedy and drama this is worth watching!"
2,Pryor deserved better.,"This film was intended to be a drama, but was reworked as they shot it because producers wanted humor added. The result is ridiculous. Still, Richard Pryor starts out very convincing and totally committed to his part. Pryor could have played this straight because he had the chops. It would have been great to see him in a straight drama just this once. There's a point late in the film where his character, Eddie, asks aloud, ""What are you doin', Eddie?"" I think Pryor was asking himself the same thing."
2,Not a Hero,"Pryor tried to make a POW into a laugh blast. It blew up. It does not work. Could have been done better but they went way out in left field to make him so tragic and his humor just does not pull the plot. It's like a mule pulling a house...not gonna happen. However, it is a statement of what Hollywood thought of Vets...so buy it for that reason and see how the new Vets are portrayed in 2 or 3 years..."
3,Good...worth owning,"I can't believe there is little to nothing of the Roger Miller (Mission of Burma, Birdsongs of the Mesazoic, Solo work) to buy on the web! The one album that was not very good, as he apologized for during a brief conversation with me, after a show, was Win! Instantly! No worries, check out Xylyl and a Woman in Half, Maximum Electric Piano/The Big Industry if they can be found!!! I can't find either of these solo projects, but would BUY INSTANTLY if I could."
5,Stunning!,This is a gorgeous piece of crystal and has all the beauty and grace of the Waterford name. This is a perfect gift for yourself or someone special!
2,JAMS ARE RAPPED!,"Bought this one as a didnt know what to expect ??Only like a few tracks, but maybe not my kinda music scene..everyone takes risks in life, think this dvd is one of mine..."
4,really cool dvd,This dvd is really cool since it has some of my favorite videos in digital quality. The behind the scenes stuff and the rest of the extras make the price a bargin. I will definitely get this when it is realesed officaly.
1,A disgusting book,A traitor's disgusting attempt at self-justification. Why is Blake not extradited to England to complete his sentence?
5,Don't let the book cover deceive you!,"This is truly a sequel to the movie ""Seven""! The artists and authors have put together a non- religious, creative, worldly- wise perspective of what original sin is really like. An astounding collection of short stories accented with a comical flair that keeps you guessing from the beginning to the end, of what to expect in the next story. The authors are truly in unison with compiling fictitious situations that causes you to ponder and relate them to real life events. The beginning section on anger opens the door too wanting to read the remaining six. Reading this book keeps you on your feet in swift thinking and daily prayer, because you never know what lies beneath the true heart of man. I recommend this book to all of the subway, marc train, charter bus, shuttle flight commuters out there."
3,"Incomprehensible, but fun","One can't begin to describe ANGELS, a lensed in New York-oddity that is probably the most bizarre thing Harry Novak ever released. God is a dapper black man who needs to recruit angels into his depleting Heaven. As such, he intentionally sends out nun hit-ladies to run over people in an Art Deco-styled Bentley. Throw in two macho gangster types, a young Vince Schiavelli, a Robert Mapplethorpe-type photographer who likes to photograph dead things, a mime, a hysterical yenta and you get -- I don't know! You tell me! Shot in 1975, this type of counter-cultural nonsense had long since left neighborhood theaters. GETTING INTO HEAVEN is the disc's ""square-up"" reel, where we get Uschi Digart, and lots of her, to make up for the rather ""chaste"" quality of ANGELS. You'll want to get this disc for all the retro bonuses, trailers for hippie-flavored art and exploitation movies that nobody has ever heard of before!"
1,Not a wise choice,"Definitely not a well-made product. I have had my armband for approximately two months and the velcro is already peeling away from the neoprene. On top of that, the poor-quality stitching has broken through the neoprene in multiple locations which has left me with large holes in the band and velcro that hardly sticks. Other than that, it is really just a poorly designed item...not user-friendly at all."
3,Mostly good,"Good quality, hooks on good to my '11 GTI 130 molding. The straps are much to short though. The rubber blocks on the straps are completely useless so I took them off."
4,PWC Hull Huggers,"Probally as good as it comes for PWC's. Vinyl cover could be more durable, but ease of fastening is very good."
4,PWC fenders - best so far,Purchased 2 sets for our PWC's which worked out well. I used a combination of the rubber blocks and the hooks provided to attach to the PWC's. We docked our crafts in a marina for two weeks and they stayed put and did their job protecting the hulls. I bought another set to make it three fenders on each boat if needed.
3,Hull Hugr Fenders,"I've had these for a few months now and have only used them a few times because they can be a pain to get put on properly. I usually clip one to the tow loop on the back of the PWC and using the provided block, hang the other one from the storage compartment in the front. If the water is pretty choppy, I usually come back to the ski to find one or both of them have come off the fender. The straps that come with them are hard to keep tight and seem to work loose when there getting banged around."
5,Great Product for the price!,I always bought from fein directly but since I couldn't to googled the part number this came up - and to my surprise it was cheaper so I bought 3 packages!
4,If your a Ryan Adams Fan.....,...I think your gonna like this.Some unplugged stuff from Ryan Adams plus him in the Studio with Toots and the Maytels.I wish it could have been longer but better than nothing.Hopefully he will record a live dvd one day but until then this is what you will have to settle for.
4,Ryan is having fun,"A must for any fan. Worth it for his duet with Toots Hibbert alone. The sound quality is excellent, and it has versions of many of his best known songs."
3,Just A Home Design and Decoration Book - No House Plan Ideas,"This book has a more design and decoration approach than its predecessor, Sunset Western Ranch Houses, which focused mostly on history of this house style. Honestly, I was expecting to see a more house-plan ideas oriented book than simply a picture book with some talking on it. This might be a useful book for those who are just looking to give their house (already a ranch-style) a more traditional look, or for those who simply like this subject. I'll give this a three-star rating because, sometime in the near future, when I get my ranch house built, it could be more interesting to me. I'll keep the book on my shelf."
2,PWC splash guard,"This product is designed for a ""universal fit"", but on my 2005 Sea Doo there wasn't enough lip suface on the bow to accomodate proper fit for riveting the unit to the boats surface."
2,"poor machine work ,on z type mount","The Z type mount for the ar 15 handle,even when you over tighten the screw support ,still has side to side play,even the scope tree mounts ,won't align in the mount and you can see the gaps,so you can not zero in,not a good buy"
1,Product picture is not the item I got,"Product picture is not the item I got .Picture shows 3 set of fron air slots , and item that I got has non."
3,Not particularly interesting.,"I picked this up when I picked up the manga series ""Doll"" by Mihara. Interestingly enough, the two mangas have almost the exact same premise. However, Mihara's series treats the subject in much more interesting and thoughful ways. I found this manga to be rather boring."
5,Storyline ....,"Since Amazon didn't post an editorial review for this book, here is the storyline from the DJ: ""Sheila and her classmates don't expect anything out of the ordinary when they choose to focus their class project on the ancient caves beneath their town. But in the cellars of Peblow's shop, where Sheila's father works, the four friends discover a mysterious walled-in archway -- and bump into a present-day problem as well. Will Peblow's have to close? Will Sheila's father lose his job? With the help of a local librarian, the young detectives follow the clues of the mysterious archway back to a 16th-century puzzle. Eventually, they find that the solution to their puzzle is tied to the fate of Peblow's. Reader's will share the excitement as the four detectives discover that events of 400 years ago can seem as exciting as those that are happening today."" This story is set in Nottingham, England."
1,The sucky life of girls.,"This movie was awful and utterly pointless. Well, maybe there was a point, to show how naive this girl was. Totally stupid movie!!!"
5,Can you stand the suspense??????,"Warriors #5: All around the forest, cats are being attacked by a pack of bloodthirst dogs chanting, ""Pack,pack! Kill,kill!"" All the clans are suspicious of one another. It seems that Bluestar has declared war against Windclan, for she accuses them of all the rabbit bone piles left in their territory.Fireheart tries to stop this maddness from getting out of hand. He goes into Windclan territory and tells them not to. Bluestar accuses Fireheart of being a trator. She seems to go mad when she says, ""StarClan has turned against me! If it's a war StarClan wants, it's a war StarClan gets!"" If only Fireheart can stop Bluestar from going to crazy with this. Meanwhile, some mysterious cat is feeding the dog pack cats, getting them ready for the kill on ThunderClan. Will ThunderClan make it out alive?"
5,a whole new appreciation of cats!,"a co worker left a couple of these on the 'free table' at the office. i picked them up intending to give to my grandkids (i'm over 60). I had to read them first to be sure they were suitable for the children and now i'm so caught up in the Clans! excellent writing and the books give you a whole new appreciation of CATS!not to mention some new cool words, like Thunderpath (along which I drive in my Monster)! Holy Star Clan!"
5,Warriors,I love all the warriors books. They are filled with action and adventure. There are parts where Erin made the book a mystery and it made me wonder what is going to happen next. There are also parts that are full of action and cat fights are huge.
5,1# warriors fan,i love all of the warriors books! i love this one the most though. every chance i get i have my nose stuck in it!
4,Warriors: A Dangerous Path,"I really like this book because it has a great amount of action and even some mystery. ThunderClan did a great job when they planned how to get the dog pack out of the forest. At the end, it really urges you to buy the next book because the Clan leader, Bluestar, dies and the position of the leader is being left to the main character, Fireheart."
5,this is one of the best books ever,"i love all erin hunters books,but this is one of my favorites. ive read all the warrior books(series 1 2 3 and two books of 4) but this series and book, beside darkest hour,is my favorite.i wont give anything away, but you MUST read this"
5,Skyler,Wow it was a sad endpoint g I recommended this book to my sister and she also loves it. Go Erin Hunter!!
4,Warriors #5,"Good book I'd recommend reading it. It is a great thriller and since I read others,I thought it was great."
5,The Change,"This was wonderful. I did not expect the outcome, but that is what makes these stories so captivating and really keeps my interest. I cannot wait for the next one. You will not be dissappointed."
5,one of the best books ever!,"warning!: This review contains spoilers.this is the best book in the warriors series! even better than The Darkest Hour. you have a disadvantage if you haven't read the other books before this one. Bluestar 's illness causes alot of trouble for thunderclan, so fireheart takes a bigger part in this book. Also later, Graystripe returns to the clan. Also, dogs have escaped twolegs, which gives more trouble to the clan. Anyway, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK! OR ELSE...."
4,has Bluestar gone nuts?,This book is so cool I really think you should read it but please read the first four books first.in this book Bluestar (clan leader) believes that her whole clan has betrayed her even Fireheart and refuses to make any apprentices warriors exept for Cloudpaw who doesn't believe in Starclan as bluestar thinks her ancesters are at war with her.As deputy fireheart has to face this problem plus many others as a pack of dogs is loose in the forest and he knows that as the new leader of shadowclan Tigerstar is bound to have some kind of vengance in mind for thunderclan and especially fireheart.and yet fireheart is faced with the same question over and over again Has star clan really abandoned them ?The ending to this book is so beautiful and all I'm going to say about it is that fireheart finally finds out that he is the fire that will save the clan when he performs another brave thing in order to save bluestar.buy this book you will like it
4,The Fighting Renegade,"This is a review for the ""B"" western, THE FIGHTING RENEGADEwhich stars Tim McCoy in sort of a dual role.Framed for murder six years earlier Bill Carson (Tim McCoy)has changed his identity to El Puma, leader of a gang ofMexican outlaws. Even though disguised as El Puma, Bill Carsonis still searching for the man who framed him.When Carson comes across his former assistant Magpie, Ben Corbett,Magpie sees to it that El Puma is hired to escort the scientificexpedition he is working for. However, when the professor is killedwith El Puma's knife, and the diary that has information as to thelocation of the treasure is missing, El Puma is in hot water again.Pretty well done ""B"" western with Tim McCoy doing a nice job as El Puma.Good cast with Joyce Bryant, Dave O'Brien, Ben Corbett and Ted Adams.Four Stars."
5,It's about time,"I became aware of Tim Murphy in 1999 when I was the country music columnist for the Atlanta Constitution and heard a demo tape that blew me away. ""Who is Tim Murphy and does he have a major records deal,"" I asked. No...then somebody is asleep at the wheel...this was the music that Nashville needed to bring young fans back to country music. Murphy was an apparent heir to the fans of Hank jr with a little Waylon and Haggard thrown in for good measure. What a shame the world did not get to hear the music of Tim Murpy...they missed something!"
1,bad show,"Do not buy this DVD, poor perfromance, poor sound quality, the band seems to lost all its energy. I hardly could watch it once. Big disapointment."
5,Tito Puente the King for ever!,"This recital dates from 1983, and contains 8 tracks loaded with this accustomed vitality and good vibration typical of this monster of the Latin Jazz.There are memorable tracks such as On Broadway, Oye como va, Stella by starlight and The opener.A document of priceless transcendence."
3,"Nice, but not great","I heard an interview with one of the singers on NPR and was moved to purchase this CD online without even listening to it. There are a few cuts I enjoy, such as the acapella cut, but the quality of the the lead singer's voice is too nasal to be moving and some of the lyrics are not very deep. It's okay. Younger women will probably like it more than others, especially those who like folk-type music."
1,Voices on the verge of utter self-absorption,"Playing polyester folk music decorated with embarrassing lyrics and infused with a titanic, but undeserved sense of self-importance, this group is the folkie equivalent of Lenny Kravitz and this CD thankfully its high water mark."
2,Repetitve and unambitious,"This book consists of five chapters: historical and theological setting, structure and argument, sources, doctrine, and conclusion. I got halfway through the book, but had to stop because it became too repetitive. There is no need to outline both the argument and the doctrine of the argument, as there is no need to discuss both the setting and the sources. The substance of the book is clear and helpful in understanding what was in Faustus's treatise. As far as I can tell, Faustus's De Gratia has not been translated. Smith's work is obviously a dissertation, beefed up either to satisfy his committee or the length requirements of the publisher. It seems to me a translation of De Gratia would have been better than this unambitious and largely uninteresting book."
2,Broken in one month,"I have only used my machine 5 times in a month and it is already broken. Up until this point, I loved it! I turned it on this morning and it wouldn't heat up, in fact the orange light that is supposed to go off when it is heated never even came on."
2,Not what I expected to get,"I bought this thinking I was getting what the discription said (Espresso/Cappuccino/Latte Maker). Well as it turned out it is only an Espresso maker, it didn't have the Cappuccino/Latte making equipment with it. and that was the main reason I purchassed it (don""t like Espresso). So now I'm stuck with a useless appliance that I have no use for."
4,Used it for 4 years,"3 years and still going... It makes crema quite nicely still after all this time... THE only factor is how well the beans are ground. If they are too fine, the machine cloggs. If they are too rough, you get watery coffee. It's been my only frustration over the years, but when the grounds are right, the machine delivers perfectly. I've decided however, to move onto the automatic machines -- hoping to solve this problem. For the price tho, this machine DELIVERS!"
3,Nice Product,"This is a nice product and is pretty easy to use as espresso machines go. The steamer tends to froth the milk a little too much (which I guess is great if you like a lot of froth!). And the espresso part seems to drip very slowly. It took a long time to get one shot.On another note, the machine is nice and heavy/durable. I like that it has much more clearance underneath the espresso part that I can actually fit a small coffee cup under there. Another very nice feature is that the steamer doesn't require ""purging"" before you use it. I've had two other machines which required you to purge hot water from the steamer before you put it in your milk. This machine steams immediately without needing to purge the water out!Great machine for the price!"
5,Simply Awesome,This grew on me fast and is difficult to take out of my CD player. My wife calls it doper music but I call it great. They need to find a major label.
3,It's just ok...,"Got this case for X-mas. I've seen it elsewhere called the scuba sleeve case because the outer coating is supposed to be a scuba-like material. It doesn't feel very rubbery to me, it feels more like hard leather. It's kind of hard to open up the sliding graffiti area on the Tungsten when you are using the case, but other than that it does offer more protection and gives the Tungsten a more rugged feel when you are carrying it around."
2,Good looking but lacks good use,"I bought this because it seemed very sleek. Although, it protects my PDS well, it is not very safe. I always thought that my PDA was going to fall off.The look is good. It does not make the PDA look big since Tunngsten is a small unit, but again, if I am not going tofeel comfortable carrying my PDA in this, it is of no use."
1,Not as good as usual,"I expected the novel to be Darcy's usual funny, light-hearted book with a cast of engaging characters. Unfortunately, while the plot was decent, the characters were unsympathetic and unengaging. I'd recommend Lydia, Letty, or Elyza instead."
3,Good for teens starting on romance,"When I started read to this book I thought that it would be boring, but it was a very good book. I have never heard of the author before but this got my wanting to read more of her books. In my opinion, this book is very good for teens wanting to read romance. It was low key and not like other authors who put very adult problems in there stories. It was easy to understand and relate with. I recomend this book for teens and others who like low key romance novels."
2,"Great styling, not so sure about the craftmanship","Pro's:-This is a very sharp looking watch, I like the styling.Con's:-Rubber gasket around the winder came off within a week. It still looks fine, but up close you can see something is missing.-Over the course of a week I've had to correct the time three times. Once was after not wearing it for two days, so that is fine. One adjustment was a correct of three minutes, and another was 20 minutes.I like the styling enough that I'll give it a few more days. Any additional issues and it will go back. It is definitely not worth the ""list price"". I caught a 20% off sale from the Amazon's price. The watch would have been returned already if I had paid the full amazon price ($180 range).Update May 2010- Never kept good time, but as mentioned before, I liked the style.- I dropped it, from waist height, onto carpet. The second hand broke off, and the watch no longer works. I won't order a Stuhrling watch again....nice style, but poor quality."
4,"Nice Design, Great after sale service","Its a nicely design watch but seems a bit too big for my style, but that can be subjective. What I am really impress is the after sale service. A week after I got this watch, I encountered a knock which causes the second & hour hand to become detached. I emailed their customer service twice about warranty issue and clarity on the procedure/documents required as I do not live in the US, and they were quick to response to my queries. For your info, I sent my watch back for repair on 1st July and received it back on 29 July in good working condition again."
3,Looks awesome but...,"I have to admit I love this watch its a great value that looks like it is worth 4 times as much as what its selling for. However within two months of normal wear the minute hand became unhinged. Easy enough fix at the local jewelery store for under the $20 Stuhrling would charge for shipping and handling to fix it under warranty.It looks amazing but be warned of the quality.Update: After having the watch repaired the same issue happened again, poor quality product.I will never buy Stuhrling again, next time I will stick to a more trusted brand name."
1,Buyer Beware,"Great looking watch. Unfortunately it apparently has a Chinese-made movement. Time was reasonably accurate; however, automatic winder hung up and would not function, so it had to be hand wound every day. Also after several months of not very hard use, the second hand fell off. My watch repair guy said he wouldn't even open the case."
4,Amazing Adventure,"This book is an account of what might be an ordinary trip for some but became an extraordinary adventure for a 12 year old girl and her brother who were, as the Raggedy Ann and Andy who accompanied them, sent or taken from place to place, repositioned frequently, and then expected to immediately adjust to the new surroundings. It is told by an amzingly insighful young girl who watched with curiosity, absorbed the events occurring around her and mentally recorded them, allowing her to tell the tale 60 years later. The book is a fictional account of a very real United States in the year before World War II and the people this girl met on her adventure. It is thoughtfully written, a delightful story, a good read and the type of book you encourage your friends to read."
5,Life In The Thirties,"A facinating and piquant account of a young girl whose travels take her to the deep south, Hollywood and back while she makes the difficult journey from childhood to adolescence. An accurate portrayal of life during the late thirties, told in an interesting and entertaining way. A most enjoyable book."
3,Antiseptic reworking of a classic tale!,"I last saw this French/English animated film in 2000 on VHS. The copy is good, but I need to buy a new copy. The storyline follows familiar ground with a twist. Pinocchio goes into space to battle Monstro, the space-whale who threatens to destroy the earth. Our hero is helped by Nurtle the space turtle and the power of hypnotism, which Pinocchio thinks he has mastered. The songs are cute, but forgettable, our wooden friend is now blonde, but Gepetto, the fox and the cat and the good fairy return. The video is good clean fun and a family treat. I hope to get my kids to sit down and watch the film with me. It is safe and entertaining."
3,Pretty cool,"I saw this movie on TV one saturday afternoon when I was around 8 years old, this would’ve been the mid 70s. I really loved it, the creatures had a profound affect on me and I would constantly draw the Giant Space Crab. Over the years I have tried to find this movie on VHS, then DVD always coming up empty. I began to wonder if it really existed. Finally, I found it on amazon.So.. how is it after all these years? Well as an adult I was a bit underwhelmed. The story is a bit weak and the pacing is a bit uneven though the production and art are very well done, but most importantly my inner child was freaking out, he loved it still.Definitely worth it."
3,ahhh the memories,"I picked up this movie for the simple fact that on Christmas eve this movie along with a few others that can be found on amazon was airedover all I was impressed by the quality, being that the cartoon itself over forty years old but the transfer was great I wanted to keep it as a holiday special but there are little one that want to watch it all the time I would recommend this film for all that is still young at heart"
5,Must Have Rare Classic,"This is a Movie i luckily seen once on television as a child.For years i thought about Pinnochio,and his journey to Space.Finally i found the movie in DVD format on Amazon.It is a great story,from Earth,to Space,and back to Earth again!And the quality,and Beautiful colors are amazing!Producers of Cartoon Movies today should look back to see the quality of rare,wonderfully told stories of our past!!!Ray Burrows...33"
1,Bad Movie Can Be Guilty Pleasure????,"Have you ever seen a children's movie with an atomic explosion?? This is the reason that there is Monstro, a flying killer whale on the loose in outer space. Well, Pinocchio comes back to save the world from this gigantic beast. The animators from this film come from Belgium, as you can tell by the credits which have mostly foreign names on its rosters. They were probably rejects from Disney or Hanna-Barbera because the animation is truly abyssmal. (...) It sports some fairly innoculous songs which leave the show when we meet ""Nertle the Twertle"" (...)"
3,Not as good as the original chai of this brand...,"I find to be too sweet tasting after I make a Fog, and the amazing & spectacular spice that the original had is numbed down. It's a decent chai, but I just don't like it that much..."
3,The Japanese CONSTANTINE,"Mail is the Japanese CONSTANTINE. It is done as 5 seperate stories and is low budget. Reji exocises spirits using a golden pistol. Think more James Bond than religious. The special effects are more fitting for a TV series, and watching it, I think it could have been done better as anime. Mikoto, the assistant, is recognizable from Kill Bill 1. The acting is weak, but the story idea is sound. Buy it used or you'll be disappointed."
2,Too Many Cooks! Bloody awful,"Just when you thought the ZZ-Top Self-Remixed and Edited 70's songs with added Synth Drums and awful remastering on their cd releases were the worst thing you've heard from them, some Boneheads thought It would be a good Idea to release all their pre-ZZ material (a thoroughly excellent Idea) and Remix them as well, with some semi-talented (presumably German) studio musicians overdubbing their guitar/bass/drums over these nuggets-era psychedelic blues tracks, resulting in a horrible clash between 80's hard rock and bluesy psychedelia. There are better comilations out their (cheap too) with the original 67-68 American Blues/Moving Sidewalks material untampered with. save yourself the $ and seek out those."
4,Sky Cries Mary - 'Exit At Axis' (Capitol),"Good Sky Cries Mary four-track EP, came out a year or so prior to the band's 'A Return To The Inner Experience' CD. The wailing ""Moon Dream Meadow Allegory"" (4:52) is probably the best cut on this EP. But ""Back To The Sea"" (4:07) and ""Cornerman"" (5:28) pull their weight as well. This all-too short title comes to a close with ""Elephant Song"" (8:02). My only complaint is I really wish this EP had like maybe two more songs. Still, a should-have."
5,cute series!,"This was a cute series. These books are written from a boy's point of view and that makes them very unique. I don't know how Oke could write in a boy's point of view so well! It was as if a boy had written the book, which is probably why this series is not overly romantic, except for the last book. It had some pretty funny parts--and that helps make a book good.I like the last one in this series the best."
3,"Nice Set, but not perfect","My (new) wife and I were looking for a nice set of serving tools to use for our wedding. This set was very nice, solid construction, good weight, and at the right price point. We wound up returning because of some flaws in the face of the server, which, since it was for the wedding, we needed to be perfect for the engraving.Overall, as a guy, I wouldn't have noticed, but the bride to be picked up on the flaws right away. So in short, if it's just for everyday use, or if you get lucky and get a perfect set, by all means, go for it!"
3,Infraterrestre will rise again!,"Hi to all Santo fans, I`m the one to blame for the crapy visual effects of Santo Infraterrestre, but for the time and budget... well at least there`s something. I recently talk to the producer Hector Molinar and plans are on the way to remaster the film and ad new special effects, really good this time, so expect a re-relase at the end of the year. Please spread the word .You can contact me in krostyuno@hotmail.com"
5,Memorable Music,"I've loved Anne Murray's music for as long as I can remember - her amazing voice, great lyrics, and memorable tunes tend to stick with you.This particular CD has many of Anne's most memorable/known tracks - with a few exceptions.Overall, I would highly recommend this CD to all the Anne Murray fans out there, as well as those who just like good love songs. I would categorize the music as easy listening/light country - if that sounds like something you'd be interested in, give this CD a shot - I think you'll be glad you did!"
3,Anne Murray,"It's a bit better than ""okay"" but I don't like having to adjust the volume song by song, sometimes even within the song. I'm a big Anne Murray fan, so I like having her greatest hits, even if I have to exert a little effort throughout."
4,Anne Murray Greatest Hits,The CD Package was cracked diagonally from top to bottom. The CD itself was not damaged.
4,Great set,Great set. Wonderful picture. Lots of inputs - including a cablecard which I love. Great 1080i. Don't know how it handles 1080p since I don't have my PS3 - yet. Not clear if it will do 1080p on the HDMI although the specs are clear it will do that on the components.Only some oddball things annoy me:* Very hard to set favorite channels. Just gave up.* Labelling of the channels does not include channel logos (like my LG does; great feature)* Lack of a guide. Kind of stupid to have a cablecard and have to switch to the Comcast STB to see what's on.* PIP seems to be restrictive on what can be in the main picture. You can put the digital tuner in the PIP but you can't activate the PIP if the digital tuner is the main picture (not the PIP)* Menu system is slow. Often you click the remote and the menu doesn't change. Thought for a while the remote signal did not register but now think the menu is just slow and misses the signal.
1,Not happy,"The product doesn't seem to work properly and it's refurbished, so I'm thinking of sending it back."
2,Very poor picture quality for this type of set,"I was very bothered by the DNIe effect on 'noisy edges' - instead of minimizing noise, this set seems to bring out lots of detail in the noise that simply isn't there. For digitally perfect pictures, this may not matter, but for everything else, I felt this really ruined the picture.Since there are many other good sets in this price range, I simply can't recommend this set for any reason. None of the other sets I tested (Sony, Panasonic) with the same source material show the same problem."
2,Sparce,I wasn't very impressed with this book. I think I was looking more for an unbiased price guide. I find it hard to believe it when appraisors are appraising things that they own.
3,religious,Purchased for classes we were taking. I found it was benificial for the class but hav not had a chance to utilize it in the real world
5,Superb,"Murder occurs at the fictional college of St. Thomas's at Oxford University. The victim is an abrasive and unpopular professor. But luckily, Ernest Brendel, a Viennese lawyer ""of European reputation"", is visiting the college as a guest lecturer and, luckily, happens to count crime detection amongst his hobbies.This is just a great example of the classic, locked room murder mystery from Britian's golden age of mystery writing, and you will not be able to put it down. Interestingly, the character of Ernest Brendel is VERY similar to Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot - both use ""psychology"" to solve crimes; both are described as quirky, physically; both are bombastic; both rely on getting people to talk (because murderers always eventually make a slip); both grow more ""foreign"" in their manner to put the insular english at their ease; etc."
4,A fast and fun read.,"Doug Guinan hits a bulls-eye describing life (at times very decadent, sometimes frightening) and the people (vain and plastic are too kind) of West Hollywood. His writing is very descriptive and sharp and frequent times hilarious. My only complaint was the ""Oh Mary"" dialogue between the characters. It impressed me as passe and too 1970s West Village/Castro, and I found myself wanting the characters to get over it. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the book, and I'm hoping Mr. Guinan writes a sequel."
2,UGH!,"I give this book two stars (one for the cover, and the other for the sex scenes). Other than that, this book was a waste of my time. I hated these characters and basically couldn't see why the author would think I should want to root for them. What happened to Shane was obscene. Kevin basically bullied him into becoming a 'roided-out monster and then left him that way. What a waste!"
5,"Fun, irreverent, close-to-home. Gay fiction as it should be.","Not the most sympathetic character you'll ever meet, Kevin embodies all that is glitz and glam about the party boy scene. Materialistic, and not just a little shallow, our hero cuts a wide swath through the gay world of West Hollywood.By turns truly hilarious and truly sad, Doug Guinan succeeds in winning the reader over, creating characters at once pathetically jaded and ultimately redeemable.Spend a nice day at the beach, and while you are out there, read this book!"
4,Surprisingly wonderful,"A friend loaned me ""California Screaming"" with the comment that it was perfect ""summer trash"" reading, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it's actually quite wonderful, well-written, carefully crafted, and utterly accurate. The book reminds me a lot of Balzac's ""Lost Illusions"" in which a young, beautiful, dewy-eyed would-be poet is seduced by the big city, taken in by an older rake, but then... well, I don't want to spoil the ending; suffice it to say that these relationships existed in Paris in the 1830s just as they do today in Los Angeles. Guinan's worldview is of course less tragic than Balzac's and I was pleased to see the characters achieve some ""growth"" as the novel achieves ""closure"" (pardon the LA-speak). A wonderful novel that will have you reading late into the night."
4,Go for the money...,"I have mixed feelings about this book. While i found the writing style very easy to read and did enjoy the story (i finished the book in 2 days) i had alot of trouble with the message the book conveys. Im giving the book 4 stars because it was a fun and easy read. I know it's a work of fiction, but, unfortunately i know characters like this in real life (alot of them)..and i found that depressing. Every single character is very superficial and while i held out alot of hope for the ending i was sort of disappointed (i won't give anything away but just when i thought the main character would grow up he kinds of says to himself...""damn, he got fat?""). Anyway, it's still a good read."
4,On a winter's day,"Kevin has fled to LA, and remains directionless, until a chance meeting with media mogul Brad Sherwood. The two have what they think is a one-night stand, but Brad is smitten and Kevin goes along for the ride, and finds himself awakening to what life can offer, and not just in material wealth. But can this relationship work when Brad is fighting to keep his media empire and Kevin doesn't even have his own source of income? I was expecting, like some reviewers, another fluffy gay novel, but what I found was a more intelligent, fluffy gay novel. It's a surprising read because it doesn't end with a cliché, happy ending, but rather with a more realistic and hopeful one. I didn't become enthralled with the story until towards page 100, and by then, I was hooked. For those who enjoyed ""Sex Toys of the Gods"" and ""Every Man for Himself"", then this will certainly fit the bill."
3,"Funny, insider's view of gay Hollywood","A good gay beach read. Doug Guinan writes with authority about the Hollywood scene. He's obviously been there and taken notes. The book is funny and perceptive, but loses (sexual) tension about halfway through. Guinan sets up a subplot about the corporate scheming of a Hollywood mogul, but resolves this subplot without conflict. Still, I recommend the book for its sly comedic style, Hollywood insight, gay beauty tips, and finally, it's abs-solutely fabulous cover photo."
5,"WITTY, FUNNY, CLEVER AND AN EYE-CATCHING COVER","The title and cover alone grabbed my attention initially, as well as the back cover reviews! If this is a first time author, he has a ""HUGE"" career ahead. The story line is fast moving and very much like real life in Los Angeles...(for some of the ""lucky"") It is a MUST read for all gay men who might be curious about the ""Velvet Mafia""......and also for those readers who want to just have a laugh and some good entertainment! I just hope there will be a sequel...need to know what happens between Brad and Kevin! (and by the way, the author referred to a hairdresser on Melrose Place, and he was not fictitious! Best HAIR I have ever had!!!)"
2,"No hugging, no learning","Seinfeld supposedly used this single guiding principle in his sitcom. I hated it. Although I didn't hate this book (much), it suffers from the same flaws. No character is or becomes likable. No one learns anything at the end (except perhaps that they can be bought). And the author for some unknown reason ends the book just when some interesting change seems possible for everyone involved! It made me angry to think I got all the way through the book for this! Will Kevin find happiness in a normal existence or must he return the empty obnoxious world painted for us in the book?It's not that hard of a read and it does have some moments. After all, it did keep my interest for three days, enough to finish it. I guess that's worth something."
2,Wish I had waited for the paperback version,"This book was alright but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to someone. It was a beach read. You really don't have to think that much. I felt the author spent tried more to develop other characters than developing the relationship between Kevin and Brad. I thought the sex scenes you would find in a book like this to be few and far between and rather cheesy. The plot was uneven. For example, it appeared a relationship was developing between Rob and Kim but that never materialized. I also found the book to be full of cliches and snobbish one-liners. Like I said, a beach read."
2,Skip this one,"Definitely a fluff piece. No real story here. Poorly developed characters, some need not even appear in the book. The character of Shane could have been dropped from the book and would not have made one difference to the storyline. Borders on cartoonish."
1,I Wish There Was An Option For '0' Stars,"This is the worst of the worst. I picked this book up, expecting shallow yet entertaining (like the hilarious Misadventures In The 213) but all I got was shallow. Even by these diminished standards, the writing is unbelievably inept -- with the most annoying thing being the point-of-view changing in mid-paragraph. I guess if you slap a sexy stomach on the cover, any book can get published."
1,Talk about unlikable characters,"Not everything about this book was awful. There are a few funny, witty exchanges and some of the supporting characters are intesesting. However, the two prinicpal characters are dull and so self-absorbed that you never really care what happens to them. I didn't feel the author ever made their romance engaging or even believable.Even though the novel was short, some scenes felt recycled as the story went forward (example: when he feels in someone's debt, Kevin ""rewards"" them with flashes of his superb naked body... at several points in the book. I smiled..... the first time.)When I first saw this book at A Different Light bookstore, I thought, ""that awesome torso on the cover must be compensating for a pretty weak novel"". I wish I had listened to myself."
4,"A good quick read, not trash, but a bit trashy","I thought it was a good book, and definitely better writing than one usually finds in this kind of novel (the Jackie Collins plot comparisons are fairly valid). If you're expecting a major milestone in gay literature, don't bother, but if you have a sense of humor, give it a shot. I think some of the readers who have been very critical took the book far too seriously."
4,Nicely done,"Guinan really has it all (or at least the knowledge) from luxury living, the gym routines, wild parties to the business side and even involving some mafia (wanna be)schemes. It was exciting to read and thanks for the tip Doug, next time I'm flying out, I'll send my baggage over via FedEx a day before my departure, saves lots of time!"
5,The Gay Jackie Collins of the 90's...,"For all those gay men out there, like myself, who grew up reading the trashy novels of Jackie Collins, just for the chance to occasionally encounter a gay character, here is a novel that takes you one step further. Kevin, Brad and friends will ring true with each of us, though they populate a world most of us only suspect really exists. For a formula-type novel, the last third includes some action one might not expect. And the whole book is infused with humor, yet rarely treds on true stereotypes. Each man is an individual, and you will come to care about each one in his own way. Don't expect a nice pat finish, because these characters have long lives yet to live (in many more books, hopefully). So as you head to Rehobeth, South Beach, or Fire Island, pick of a copy of this book and enjoy the sin of reading really engaging trash... O :-)Bug"
2,"This book takes ""shallow"" to a whole new level","After reading ""Misadventures in the 213"" and ""Sex Toys of the Gods,"" I was looking for another ""young people (mostly gay) trying to make it in LA"" type of book, one of my favorite mini-genres. However, California Screaming is an insult to the term ""beach read."" The characters have no personality, at least no appealing personality. There is no one I could relate to in this entire book. It's just body-worshipping vacancy at its worst. The sex is even lame. If this had been my first ""gay"" book, there would have been no second. Do yourself a favor and read one of the books I named above. Skip this one."
1,$1.09 per page.,"I wouldn't be opposed to this book if it wasn't for the fact that each piece of paper cost over a dollar. Add to that the fact that it is a paperback, and the inferior binding process which makes my dollar bills, I mean pages, fall out, and you have a book which I would never buy again. Thankfully all the information contained herein is easily found on the internet for free."
4,Storage pocket for installing radio,"To get this product to fit correctly into my Jeep's pre-existing mounts, I had to do quite a bit of cutting on this product. So if you want something that will just fit perfectly without you doing anything to it, then this is not for you."
3,Small Shelf,"I know it has to do with the space that is there, but I got this one because of the shelf. The shelf is not really even big enough to put one CD case in. It will work of the slim line case though. Other then that is a mount like most of the other I have used, it works."
4,Very good for basic knowledge despite a few errors.,"I own both the second and third editions of this book, and I can attest that the improvements in the third edition make this volume far more valuable than before. Katzner now provides far more general information about language families that should satisfy the curiosity of someone not in this field. Also, the individual language entries were updated. I especially value the language map.My two main gripes with the book are: 1) there isn't enough information about individual languages, especially those with non-Roman character sets; and 2) there are some errors that need to be corrected. One of the most glaring errors that I noticed within 3 minutes of opening the new edition is Katzner's remark that the ß (eszet) character was totally eliminated from the German language in the 1998 spelling reform. This is undeniably false."
3,"Pretty good, but wanted much more...","This book was good for the purpose it was written. It's basically a litsing of the major language and language families of the world. Personally I had expected it to have some history on the development of these languages, but no luck. So if you want a basic listing it's good. But overall it's very dry."
1,Waste of money,"If you want a paragraph per language describing how many people speak it and what the alphabet looks like, buy this book. If you really want anything of educational value, forget it. You will waste your money as I did. The description is very misleading. You think it will actually teach you about the development of world languages. It does not. The info included could probably be found easily on the internet for free! It is just trivia."
5,Just Like Heaven alone is worth the price...,"Dinosaur Jr. covers the Cure? Yeah, but where the Cure did the original ""Just Like Heaven"" as an eighties pop piece more suited to sparkle on John Hughes movie soundtracks, J Mascis and company tear it up and put it back together as a true masterpiece of anger and grunge. The bass growls, the screamed YOUUUUUU of the chorus, and the way the song ends abruptly in a crash of guitars and feedback all contribute to a fine reinterpretation of a surprisingly emotional piece.Not truly B-sides but clearly there to fill out some space, both ""Throw Down"" and ""Chunks"" are less complete ideas than mere snippets of songs, fun, bass-heavy and raw, still clearly from the heyday of Dinosaur Jr. The original LP, a full-sized disk played at '45, is a collectors item - the B-side of the album's vinyl is imprinted with anatomical drawings of organs and a Rice Krisps box - but even the CD's cover art is vintage Dinosaur Jr. Worth owning in either format."
5,Eloquent and moving,"If you want to learn more about Joshua L. Chamberlain, what better way to do it than to read his first hand accounts and speeches. This book is a compilation of several articles he wrote for a magazine and a number of speeches he gave after the war. Bear in mind that the magazine articles were heavily edited by the editor of the magazine, much to the chagrin of Chamberlain, who was quite angry! One of his speeches at the dedication of the Gettysburg monuments very succinctly outlines his reasons for volunteering for the Union Army and the ideology that kept him going back to the field, even after a horrible wound that should have killed him. Chamberlain wrote very eloquently about his experiences and his speeches are extremely moving. A must read for any Chamberlain fan!"
4,Bayonet! Forward! My Civil War Reminiscences,"As an avid reader of Civil War history, I found the book interesting, but not quite as exciting as I would have suspected. Chamberlain's description of battles are a little heavy and confusing; some of which, no doubt, has to do with 19th century semantics and the fact that he had been a professor of rhetoric, oratory and modern language (not to mention that I am not an infantryman!). His descriptions, however, bear the special benefit of this hero's personal experiences in battle and are probably made more humble than they should be judging by the man's character."
5,A century later,"I cannot read enough about this man. He is truely an American Hero, not only in what he did for our country but because of the way he looked at life and others. The part I liked the best in this book was the oration on the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln that he gave in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 12, 1909, especially since this is the two hundreth anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln. Well done."
2,"Bayonet! Forward"": My Civil War Reminiscences","I became acquainted with the story of Joshua Chamberlain after reading Shaaras' ""Killer Angels"" and wanted to learn more about him. This book has been an overwhelming dissapointment. For a man who was present at a number of important and exciting events in US history and an authentic American hero, his narrative is plodding and dull. His battle decriptions and his attention to minor troop movements are confusing and essentially unreadable. The maps he provides are completely inadequate in providing a better understanding what took place. The maps can be excused by the fact that they are provided with 19th century technology, his muddled writing style cant be. If you're looking for an enjoyable reading experience that will help you learn more about Chamberlain, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"Looks nice, but not stable.","I bought this filing cabinet because I have the matching chair. It's a beautiful piece, but difficult to build and very unstable."
4,So-so Doris Wishman flick with great extras,"I really do like Doris Wishman's films but this wears really thin really quickly. After beating around the bush for almost an hour the film finally reveals that the guy tortuing women is doing so because he inherited the traits from his literal ""organ"" transplant. His best friend dies and he must have his ""organ"" sewn onto his body. Apparantly the two were very ""close"" before he died. This film is really just stupid and does not have Chesty Morgan or Blaze Starr to distract the viewer with inept acting. The extras are really classic! A US Navy 50's era educational film on how to prevent VD. It surprised me over and over with its use of full frontal nudity. How to wash it and how to clean it...quite amusing. This disc is worth it for the extra stuff in my opinion."
2,Chopped to pieces,"You'd think my review title might be a clever comment on the film but it's more to the butchery of the censors.If you compare the actual film to the very trailer for it which is on the same disc you will see how it's been clearly cut to rippons and most of the sex scenes, bar one, have been removed.How this happened I do not know. The film is clearly an 18 rated so why the need for the scissors?Anyway the film is ok but the promise of the trailer (and make of that what you will) is not delivered in the film due to the cuts.Shocking."
1,Awful film with historic Navy extra feature,Not ironic. Not erotic. Not fun or funny. Less than 1 star. This one goes in the trash bin rather than getting resold. Period US Navy educational film in the DVD extras of minor interest.
5,The guide to real world sales excellence,"The Mind of the Customer opens with the parable, ""How would you treat your one last customer?"" I found this opening to be a memorable and griping way to introduce the importance of customer viewpoint.Demonstrates practical, measurable, skills that are the key to success in today's challenging and evolving relationship between sales professionals and customers. This is no basic guide to sales. This shows you how to become a valued partner for your customer.Highly recommended for anyone who is serious about developing lasting relationships with important accounts."
5,To the point.,"This book is not filled with a bunch of theory that is hard to implement. This book gives you tools to be successful tomorrow. I sell through a distribution network, and have bought this book for a couple of my customers and they have been very grateful for sharing, and we will use this approach toward building value for our mutual customers."
3,"Good story, shoddy construction","I like this story a lot, about how the gardeners make their vegetable garden and how they store the food for winter. There's a song at the end of it, too.Unfortunately, the gold tape that binds the book is very poorly glued on and is already peeling off after only a few months (and we haven't read it *that* often, either).I've seen older Golden Books without this problem, but the newer editions almost universally seem to have this issue :("
4,"Wonderful, easy read","Fun book for a toddler. Teaches a lesson about using ""please"" in a cute story without being boring to read. My son asks me to read this book to him again and again."
5,Love it.,This is a very cute book. The pictures are adorable and the plot is great! Our two year old LOVES this book. We read it several times every day as it is one of her favorite books.
5,What a Creative Book!!,"This book has the cutest animated alligator as its star. The easy reader format is great because it allows me to tell my own story, add my own voices, and allows my kids to play along."
4,Good for Learning Manners,"Super adorable illustrations accompany this imaginative story about a little alligator that wants a cookie. Little Alfie tries everything to get a cookie, but his mom keeps saying no.Finally, with a little help from mom, he figures out that he needs to say please.The best part about this story were the illustrations. They were absolutely fantastic, and perfect for the age level. The word choices were simple and the text was nice and large to make identifying letters and words easier for beginning readers. There were just a few words to each page, making it a nice length and not too intimidating for a child that is just learning to read.Sometimes I feel like children's books get a little too preachy and try to teach a lesson too often. Most of the time when my kids or I read a book, it is simply for entertainment. However, the clever ways that Alphie comes up with to get a cookie balance out the ""lesson"" of the book so that it doesn't come off as overly preachy."
2,Ok,When I ordered the book I was expecIng it to be bigger. When it showed up in the mail I was disapoited but the color and content were very nice I just dOnt think I'll be paying $11 after shipping anymore.
5,Fun Read AND Teaches Manners!,"My twin toddlers love this book! We've had this book for awhile now, and it's still one of our favorites. It's a fun, enjoyable story and has helped my girls learn how to say ""please"" when they ask for things, instead of just demanding what they want. The word ""cookie"" in the main tag line throughout the book ""think of a better way to get a cookie,"" has been replaced in our house with whatever the demand of the moment is. For example, I'll say ""think of a better way to get a glass of milk,"" and they will both respond ""may I PLEASE have a glass of milk,"" usually with big smiles. It was a fun way for them to get into the habit of saying please. I highly recommend it as an enjoyable read and/or trying to teach this concept."
5,A new favorite!,"May I Please Have a Cookie is now a favorite in my four-year-old's bedtime story selection. He loves it! We've read it enough that he now ""reads"" it to me. He likes the story, and the words are simple enough that he is starting to recognize some of them, helping him learn to read. It's cute, with bits like the mustache falling off. Thankfully, it's well enough written that mom doesn't get sick of hearing it! (Not always true of children's books). It's apparently cute enough, that my seven-year-old comes peeking in when we read it."
4,reminds me of my children,this reminds me of my children and how I'm always trying to teach them the correct way to ask for things; it's cute
2,Beatiful Deep Dish but Cracked the First time I used it !!,Well I guess I will be the first to complain about this dish.. I had a party and put a large chicken and olive oil and special sauce in this dish and started cooking for the first time. Then Disaster! The dish cracked !!! not separated but enough to allow the juice and sauce drip on oven element and made a huge mess. I contacted the LeCreuset customer service a couple of times and they just ignored my complain. I probably will never buy another one of this until they get a better customer service.
1,crummy le creuset,"This is NOT true le creuset. Mine also split in half in a 365 degree oven while cooking a chicken. This isn't the 'high end' line of the brand, but the ultra cheap version. Save your money and spare yourself aggravation. Check out Chantal, Portmeirion, or just about any other ceramic bakeware. I'll never buy this garbage again."
1,Cracked,"I also had the cracking problem with this deep dish pan. The first time I used it, I roasted a chicken and it cracked in 2. The juices from the chicken ran all over the place and it was a liquid greasy mess. I have many other Le Creuset pots and pan and have never had this type of problem. It is too bad because I love the line."
2,Disappointed,Much smaller than expected. Dimensions included a large lip on each end which was a bit misleading . I returned it as a result.
3,Nice product...if it had arrived in one piece,"I had this product shipped out to me - twice. Both times it arrived broken. I finally went to my nearest Le Creuset outlet store and bought one in person. Great product, but postal carrier didn't do a good job of handling."
1,Crushed,"I oredered this as a gift for my sister. She said she didn't bother opening it, because she could hear the broken pieces. She sent it back, no problem. UPS said it was not them (outside packing was fine), that the company did not pack properly, esp. for ceramic. I am disappionted that a gift had to be returned."
5,LOVE IT!!,"I had been using a glass pan for my lasagnas...until now. I love this pan! Easy to clean, even cooking, beautiful for serving. I purchased two more to give as gifts. A great deal on amazon, as usual!"
1,Only giving 1 star because I can't rate it a 0 star.,"DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE GAS CANS FROM SCEPTER!!! The product is very poorly made. Brought it home from the store, filled it up with water to figure out how to use it, and spent the next 15 minutes cussing at it. I never did get anything to come out. It is going back to Home Depot today. I will not be trading it for another one."
1,Had 2 of these & both filler spouts broke on 1st use,"The spout on this particular model is a complicated spring loaded device that, at least in my 2 samples, broke at first use. Ended up having to pour directly from the can with no spout into a funnel. Oh yeah, spilled gas and oh yeah, these cans are going into the trash.Useless junk."
1,DON'T BUY THIS WORTHLESS GARBAGE,"This is what happens when greenies are in charge of product design. An unusable piece of trash. I'm an experienced mechanic and a professional engineer and I can't get this stupid spout to deliver ONE drop of gas. ""turn it till it clicks"" the instruction line (you only get ONE line of instruction)... click? It's clicks in about 20 positions you knotheads !I will be requesting a product refund from the manufacturer.DO NOT BUY THIS TOTALLY DIS-FUNCTIONAL ECO DESIGN NIGHTMARE!"
1,Scepter Gas Cans,Don't buy. Never work properly. Spout will go bad within months. Major step backwards. Poured gas back in my 20 year old container and through away.
1,Stay away from these,"Please stay away from this product. I purchased mine from Home Depot and after one use the spout broke. The product is now useless with a small spring hanging from the spout and the can useless. To add insult to injury, on two ocassions the company who makes it promised to send me a new spout free of charge and both times I never received the item. Do yourself a favor and don't buy one of these."
1,worst instructions ever,"due to the recent hurricane sandy and resulting gas crisis on long island i purchased 4 gas cans already filled from a friend. the directions for use are not at all helpful with no internet service or electricity I couldn't even google it until 5 days after I bought them. I finally found directions on eHow. the scepter site instructions were no help, they didn't address this particular can they address the simplest can. after trying again with the instructions, I finally took off the spout to use a funnel, and found a little cap inside the spout! would it be too much trouble to mention this on the can? After using the funnel to fill my car, I put the cans by the trash. the 1.25 gallon does not have a cap for the tip of the nozzle so you can't block fumes after using the can."
2,Lousy gas can!,"I have two these, and I hate them. Okay, I understand the need to control emissions, but my complaint is not about the overly complicated locking mechanism. I can open it and pour fuel out. That's not the problem. The problem is the copious amount of fuel that drips out from the sliding section of the nozzle, dripping onto the ground. I've contacted the manufacturer, and they just say to follow the directions. Seems it's no big deal to them for an environmentally friendly, EPA certified, CARB compliant gas can to be leaking gasoline onto the ground because it's so poorly made. Also a little ticked because I'm not talking about a few drops of fuel, I'm talking about a couple of ounces of wasted fuel.Update: The manufacturer actually did send me two replacement nozzles at no charge, and these don't seem to be leaking. So, I'll give it two stars since the manufacturer did help."
1,As bad as the government could make it,"Used as directed, I got more gasoline on myself and the mower than in the tank.I resolved the situation in my favor with super-glue. A modest application of the glue to the green sleeve in ""clicked"" position, followed by a bit more glue with the spout depressed did the trick. So configured, gas will S-L-O-W-L-Y flow into the receptacle of my choice.Having circumvented the ""adult-proof"" features of the device, I can still say that it's completely worthless. As another reviewer suggested, buy yourself a proper funnel, preferably with a filter, and simply skip this whole spout nonsense.For pouring fuel into a leaf-blower or weed-trimmer, you might want to consider using a glass bottle as a transfer receptacle. The politburo won't like it, but don't lament. Revolutions inevitably eat their children. Our challenge is to live long enough to celebrate its passing."
1,Scepter Gas Can,Major design flaw with the spout and needs to be redesigned. On 1st use the spring in the spout popped out making the can unuseable. Do no waste your money on this until Scepter fix the problem.
1,unusable waste!,"This can is spill proof, which means that it regulates air intake which enables you to pour it into your lawnmower. I bought it because it was the cheapest. What a complete waste! I was unable to get gas from it because the childproof mechanism to regulate air intake wouldn't work. Eventually I torqued off one of the springs in the mechanism accidentally which rendered it even more useless.The only way I was able to use this device was to drill a hole at the base of the spout (use the drill away from the gas well or you may win yourself a darwin award). However my modification means now the can leaks vapor when the spout is out...I got it to work, but more out of frustration.Bottom line...don't buy this piece of junk."
1,the worst product - no instructions,Had to call the company on how to use it!!!!!!! Turns out I already broke it -Sucks..... apply pressure tilt can turn collar 1/4 turn apply pressure to can while can rests on flange --ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!HOME DEPOT DROP THIS LNE!!!
1,Total Crap,"Like the other reviews, the spout is terribly complicated to use and is not very durable, easily broken. Much spillage of course while figuring out how to get the gas out. Would NEVER buy this product ever again. There is on line a good demo about how to use the device by the way."
1,NOT friendly to humans or the environment,"The spillproof/childproof mechanism on this can simply does not work. When you do finally get it to pour some gasoline, it leaks all over your hand and everywhere else. How exactly is that ""environmentally friendly?"" If you buy this, be sure to buy a funnel, too."
1,Terrible idea,"I have the 5 gallon can - and it's a nice can. Unfortunately, you can't get the gas out through the child proof nozzle. I took the first one back and exchanged it for a new one which doesn't work either. I think there must be a way to drill out the nozzle but haven't figured it out yet so still taking the cap off and pouring into a funnell."
5,Emergency Light,Bought for 3 day emergency kit. Item is as expected. Have not had to use item yet. Would purchase item again.
5,Works,"What can you really say, snap it and it glows green. Performs as advertized. Falls a bit short of 12 hours."
4,"Low light, long life","I purchased a 4-pack of these for $4.25. This is comparable to the cost of Cyalume light sticks. These are more accurately described as glow sticks. They are half as bright as 12 hour Cyalume light sticks, but they last much longer. Mine lasted for 14 hours, until I cut it open and disabled the glow with ammonia (just a chemical experiment). Good for an emergency, but not ideal due to the low light output. Flashlights are a much better primary source of light."
5,Deborah Hansen Linzer,"Two years ago while living in Phoenix, Arizona I met Deborah Hansen Linzer through a favorite aunt of mine by the name of Kathryn who is living in Masa, Arizona. Kathryn took me to a lecture given by Deborah Hansen Linzer telling us about her book: ""Cameo Life Stories Writing Guide for Everywoman: Penning Your Portrait in Words.""I joined eight other women and began writing and answering the ninty some questions on my life. The process was very rewarding and will never be forgotten. It took me two years to write this life story down. It now has been printed and is ready to be given as a gift to my daughter Brigit in time and has been sent to the National Museum of Women's History in Washington, D.C. In time research and an analysis will be done of my life time of 1942 to 2082. I highly recommend that you read this book and do it. Judy Joyce, Pikesville, Maryland"
2,Sad,This is not Willies best by far. He is just crusing through the entire thing like it was an obligation.
2,Best days are behind him,"I have been a Willie Nelson fan for over 25 years and jumped at the chance to purchase this DVD. I was very disappointed. The performance was lackluster and it was obvious to me that Willie's famous ""phrasing"" is now being used to attempt to cover that he can no longer carry the songs that made him famous. I believe he should retire and write music."
2,Don't let the positive reviews fool you,"This DVD is a large scale disappointment. As other reviewers have noted, Willie sort of slides through one song after another during the first part of the DVD with idiosyncratic (or lazy) deliveries that lack fire and enthusiasm. The last third is somewhat better but all in all you don't finish watching with a very positive impression. He doesn't seem to really connect with the audience even though there are camera shots of people clearly enjoying themselves. Nelson's guitar playing is one of the few strong points and even with a ""lead"" guitarist playing as well, Willie plays a lot and well. The sound is also lacking in several places where Willie's distance from the mike makes for a hollow sound. I'm a long time Willie Nelson fan but I cannot recommend this DVD."
3,"Good for Rice, not slow cooking","I have owned this cooker for 2 years. At this point it still cooks rice like a charm. However, the slow cooking feature is sooooo slow that after 8 hours 1 lb. of chicken is still pretty raw (and gross).Buyer beware..."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I thought that this rice cooker was GREAT, until the hot plate stopped working after 6 months. You are better off staying away from items that are ""automatic"" - They just cause too many problems. By the time you return it to the manufacturer, you have already spent $30 in shipping the item. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,A Good Slow Cooker while it lasts,"I bought the Krups FDH212 based on it's versatility and ability to slow cook and then keep the finished recipes warm. However, 2 months past the limited 1 year warrenty period, the FDH212 stopped working correctly for slow cooking, shutting off after about 15 minutes into the cooking cycle and going to warmer. I can say that I haven't abused this machine, and it was rarely used more than 3 times a month over the period of ownership. I never used it for steaming rice or vegetables, just slow cookingIf you are interested in purchasing the FDH212, be aware that it may not last. If it does give you more than 2 years of use, consider yourself lucky. Other than that, a very versatile slow cooker that has some pretty good features, except when it is broken..."
1,design flaw????,"Not very pleased with the performance of this rice cooker. The lid cracked after just 2 uses. It seems that the lid would get ""hung up"" on the hinge every time the lid was opened. One day I looked, and low and behold it was cracked--almost halfway across the entire lid (from the hinge outward) Doesn't seem to affect cooking because the lid still seals, but a disappointment after spending extra $ on the Krups name.Also, sometimes (not always though) the slow cooker mode goes into the ""keep warm"" mode after only 10 minutes or so. I don't know why it is inconsistent, but it makes me think it will eventually stop working altogether."
1,Burns cooked rice if not used immediately,Don't buy this rice cooker. It burns the rice if you keep it in there too long which means that you can't keep any cooked rice in there for longer than an hour after it's cooked. I've had mine for a few years and now the thing doesn't even cook the rice thoroughly half the time.
2,"great rice, poor slow cooking ability","The rice cooker portion of this machine is great. The steamer is okay. The keep warm feature in all modes is also wonderful - whatever you prepare is ready when you need it to be.However, the slow cooker is VERY UNDERPOWERED. It takes twice as long as any slow cooker recipe. There is no high setting option, and it is just too slow. We have started putting it on steam cook for 20-30 minutes to build up some heat in the machine, then setting it to slow cook for hours. This helps a little."
1,Lovely while it worked,"This was a nice rice cooker when it worked, but it broke within just a few months. Faulty design that caused a wire in the lid to be broken by repeated opening and closing of the lid. I've repaired it twice now, but you would expect more from an $80 - $100 rice cooker.Other than this small detail, I recommend it highly. (I especially recommend it for people who have copious free time for repairing their expensive appliances.)"
2,Mediocre for a Krups appliance,"It looks like a Krups -- what with the stainless steel look and the fancy electronics, but, as a rice cooker, it does not perform as expected. The rice is passable but certainly not the best we've had - our very old National rice cooker produced better rice. Also disappointing is the lack of a retractable electrical cord - winding the electrical cord around a chintzy metal cord holder (unstrategically located at the bottom of the cooker) gets old very quickly. Lastly, the fancy electronic display is not very informative when cooking rice. (It may be more helpful when using the appliance as a slow cooker - but we thought we were buying a rice cooker.)Bottom line: it looks like a Krups, does not perform like one, and, with all its good looks, is decidedly un-ergonomic in its design. A disappointment. If we could, we'd return it."
3,It could be a lot better.,"This rice cooker cooks rice pretty well and very quickly. What attracted me to this appliance was that it was a rice cook, steamer, and slow-cooker in one. We live in a townhouse with a fairly small kitchen so appliances that have multiple uses are very appealing to us. I have two issues with this rice cooker: when cooking small (and by small I'm talking 4-6 servings), the bottom of the rice tends to get brown and stuck and gross. Another issue is that the non-stick coating started flaking off within the first year (we bought this back in 2008). It makes a great slow-cooker."
2,I don't like the Dialogue,"After reading and performing the play, I began to dislike it. I really hate the dialogue. It's got a bunch of ""Yes""'s and a bunch of ""Mmn""'s in the dialogue. Most of the Dialogue is basically those two words! It's awful! The characters are okay, though."
5,Chilling Insight,"This book defines a moment in time that should never be forgotten. The author has survived the horrors and atrocities imposed on people that are usually left to science fiction. The mere fact that he could remember the details of such horrors and recapture them with such eloquence is a testament to his character. This man defines the word ""hero."""
4,Cool Cool,"Well, it looks good and I liked it. I gave it to my dad for christmas. I know there is only like one picture on here, but you'll like it."
5,Masterpiece!,"Almost twenty years old and still as fresh as ever! One of the most unique bands of the eighties and nineties!A hard band to put a label on. Who cares! They sound great on this one. Funky, fun and powerful!"
5,...Gush of Memories Please!,"FromOhio takes me back to some of the best moments of high school in Columbus, Ohio. A week ago Mike Watt played here in San Diego which made me remember my love for Firehose. How could I forget this amazing album? Who knows.... But re-discovering it has been a God send! If you doubt me, just listen to the tracks provided here at Amazon and feel the eighties return to your soul."
2,"Pretty, but fragile","I've owned two of these keyboards, both of which I bought new, and both had dead keys (specifically, J through L) after a few months. It's a pity, because the size and layout of this keyboard is excellent. I now use the much cheaper Logitech keyboard, because at least when that dies it'll only cost 7 bucks to replace."
3,Needs dedicated number keys,"Size, weight, and Palm connection are great. The lack of dedicated number keys, and awkward character key fingering have become a real problem for this computer science student."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Despite the number of recent negitive reviews I bought this keyboard anyway. Well, I should not have been supprised when the number keys would not work. It appears that there are a large number of these keyboards that do not work. Save your money and time. Don't buy this keyboard."
4,Pretty Nice Keyboard,"I read the reviews here and am glad I ordered one anyway. It was no problem to hook up and doesn't interfere with sync on my Mac. The only negative is the lack of the number key row and the special function keys (problems mentioned elsewhere). But not bad if you spend a bit of time with it.I haven't had any keys fall off, nor have I found it to be unstable as some have said. The keys are quiet and have a nice tactile feedback so you know when you've pressed the key.All in all, a nice compact palm companion."
1,Wish that it worked!,"This gorgeous, engineering marvel - a full-size keyboard that's about the size of a pop tart when folded - would be great if it worked! Mine was defective, producing random characters, skipping letters and the like. Palm tech support was very nice and told me that a month ago, 30% of these keyboards were coming out of the box defective. Now (mid-April 03), he said, it's more like 50%. I did the whole new drivers drill, hard resets etc. to no avail. I returned mine and am very disppointed at the waste of time and money. If you end up buying this item, I hope you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that works!"
1,Will Fall Apart,"The piece that holds the palm to the keyboard fell apart - little metal and plastic bits everywhere. It's impossible to put back together. I hadn't mistreated or mishandled it, it is just very fragile. (In fact, I wish I had done something bad to it - I'd feel better.) I do not recommend that you buy this keyboard."
2,Timing problem with certain palm devices,"I have a Tungsten C. I had similar problems to the ones described by other reviewers. I did everything others have done (latest drivers, exchanged keyboard). I contacted Palm support and was told that some Palms have a ""timing issue"" with the keyboard and need to have a Rev B or Rev C sticker next to the serial number on the keyboard. I have not found a keyboard with a Rev B or Rev C sticker yet so I can't confirm that they will work."
4,Nice companion to my PALM,"I have both the older version, folding keyboard and recently purchased the ultra thin version. Both have good and bad points to them however, the ultra thin keyboard does sit nicely on my lap or other uneven surfaces unlike its predecessor. The keys feel relatively the same but having to get used to the function key to type numbers and other functions take a little getting used to. It literally is ultra thin which makes it easy to take along with you and I especially like how it folds in half to a very nice size. I still used both keyboards, depending on what tasks I have to do."
2,"Works great, dead technology","This is just about the coolest little keyboard you can find. It is light, portable, and it responds as well as a normal keyboard. The one downside, which I recently discovered, is that it won't work with the newer class of Palm Devices, explaining why it is so inexpensive now. When I first purchased a keyboard, it was to go along with a Zire 71 handheld. That handheld died, forcing me to upgrade to the newer Zire 72. Much to my surprise, Palm changed the connection for their PDA's, rendering the wonderful little typing device useless.So, if you are using one of the older models that it can work with, I would certainly say that it is a good buy. But, I would not count on it to last you for generations of Palm devices to come."
3,Annoying key trade-offs,"I switched from a Stowaway to this when I bought a T3. The lack of dedicated number keys is highly annoying if you are a touch typist. Having to hit a FN key instead of shift to get to parens is also really annoying. Size and rigidity is a plus, but I never thought the stowaway was that big. Overall, if you are a touch typist, I'd say this one will annoy..."
1,Tungsten C,"This keyboard did not work with my Tungsten C. Some of the keys did not function. Some keys produced the incorrect character. I returned the keyboard. After having this problem, I have read reviews on other web sites indicated similar problems for other Tungsten C users."
1,Elegant design ruined with shoddy construction,"BY ALL MEANS AVOID THIS OVERPRICED MARVEL OF MODERN ENGINEERING.I wish I could give this item 0 stars, it's that bad. I've used my keyboard very little, never dropped it, not mishandled it, and to my horror it just now fell apart. I pulled out the backstop against which the Palm rests upright and it literally came to pieces in my hands. There wasn't even that feeling of resistance that lets you better slow down and see what's going on. Just pieces of plastic and screws falling all over the place.It's pushed me another step closer to the inevitable transition to PocketPC, even though I've been a fanatic Palm user ever since the very first Palm Pilots came out. Another once great product dies an ugly death at the hands of production ""efficiency."""
1,Sad White Man Shiesters!,"As a white person, I am abhorred that this important DVD is so insanely priced, no doubt by my grubby white brethren. Now NO ONE can see this version because of their greed. Makin' me proud and well done!"
2,on a grander scale,"the author has obviously researched this great man's life thoroughly. unfortunately, she has so much to say it comes tumbling down onto the pages in the form of a poorly edited - if it was edited at all - work. it is impeded by a maddening amount of sentences aborted by "" ( ) "" and "" - "" to the point some sentences are so disjointed it is necessary to re read them to figure out where a sentence was headed before it got short circuited. some additions of this type can be informative, most are not. footnotes could have helped saved what could have been a great work on a great man by a great author. instead, it often reads as a mass of annoying self-interruptions and break up of sentence continuity."
5,A Wonderful Christmas Story,This is a great heartwarming story for families at Christmas. I can't recommend it enough!
1,Scam Seller?,Seller was quick to accept payment and nonexistant after that. I sent two E-mails to seller and received no response from seller. Merchandise never arrived and I had to file an Amazon claim for a refund.
2,CENSORED!!!!,"I was disappointed with the ""Calzonzin Inspector"" DVD. It is shorter than the original and, in some point, you miss the pace of the original film that ironicaly, was also projected in open mexican television with minor cuts.If you want the ORIGINAL ""Calzonzin Inspector"", don't waste your money until the FULL version appears.In the other side, the image quality is excelent, but I have the feeling that also the actual audio was censored."
3,30 minutes shorter than the original,"Although this is one of the funniest movies depicting government corruption in Mexico (so accurately in fact that its release was limited and it remained commercially unavailable until today) this DVD is release is missing many scenes, which is unfortunate. I sincerely hope they release the full 2 hours."
3,introductory solid state physics,"The book by Blakemore is of great value for introductory solid state physics. Unfortunately it is not updated to include recent advances such as quantum dots, Bose-einstein condensation etc. A chapter on these latest developments would be very helpful for students working in these areas or starting in these fields."
3,disappointed,"I bought this book after reading the reviews here, and was a little disappointed. The book would be helpful to those who haven't worked/interned at a firm before, where one is frequently working with construction and detailed drawings. Its how all firms work once they've moved past the early design phase."
1,Defective,Three days after receiving the knife the blade has become pitted. Will attempt to send this back when I return home.
2,An chance for something good....wasted,"I bought the movie because I'm into offbeat love stories, romances, true life dramas, etc. This was a waste. The characters, though sometimes interesting, are almost totally unlikable. The older Chinese woman seems at first to be halfway decent,only to turn into an adulterous opportunist trying to get a greencard. The younger girl is just pathetic, and all the other characters are scum. As far a romance....who cares? There's no way you care enough about them to even matter! And if you bought it thinking there was going to be a nice lesbian love bloom between the two women...keep waiting. Nice idea...lousey effort."
3,it's okay,"maybe i had too high an expectation from reading the other reviews of this series. while the story definitely has funny moments and some really likable characters, the first and last discs are not that great (or funny): the first being a little slow and the last few episodes a little too cheesy. tylor improves as the series progress but the empress is gets worse, becoming more annoying than minmay, as if that was possible, by being a completely irresponsible arrogant brat. while i liked the story as a whole, i'm not sure it's worth buying."
5,The Ultimate Space Battleship Anime Satire,"This is one of the best series I have ever seen. In true anime fashion, it opens with slapstick humor that slowly, like a fine wine, matures into a humorous commentary on life and humanity, still interspersed with silly bits more carefully chosen than in the beginning.If you have seen anime of the space battleship genre (Yamato/Star Blazers, Captain Harlock, Macross), or know about the military, this series will be all the more hilarious as the references and spoofs are brilliantly executed.This is the first full anime series I have bought; it is definitely worth the price. And RightStuf, the producing company, fixed the 4th disc problem.-- ""and so long as the irresponsible explore the unknown, we need never fear."" -- Irresponsible Captain Tylor"
3,expanded capacity,These extra trays are great for expanding your dehydrators capacity. Though I have noticed that when you lose a lot of trays it take longer for everything to dry. It fine since you can dehydrate stuff while your sleeping. If you have a Nesco dehydrator I suggest getting one of those Christmas light timers ($5-10).
3,?,"Well i never go to use this product, I have to return not cause of it was something wrong but cause I changed my mine, i bought other products from this company and they pretty good!"
3,Nesco,My son has not used these yet but he has the dehydrator and is already using it. The trays work fine. I think that they are a little pricey for the flimsy plactic they are made of. But he needed them so I bought them anyway.
5,Dehydrator trays,"The dehydrator trays are the same as the ones that came with the unit. Very easy to clean and durable for what they are made out of. If buying the FD-75 dehydrator and looking for more trays to use, buy about 3 boxes to have extra, you'll use them!!!"
3,Defective unit (deformed),"One of the units came deformed and closely impossible to fit in the whole set. But, with the weight of the entire system, the deformed unit did fit and worked. Since I am from Brazil, it's not a good idea to ship those trays back and wait for a new one to come. We are just using it as it is now. No major problems, but this kind of deformation is unacceptable."
3,Poor Quality,"I purchased a few extra trays with my dehydrator and they were of very poor quality. They are so warped that I cannot use them as the top tray or two while dehydrating, there must be significant weight (more trays) on top to flatten them out otherwise the top of the dehydrator doesn't flush to the top tray."
1,bad tray,"fulfilled by amazon, 1 tray okay the other is formed wrong. the center hub projects past the surrounding side surfaces, holding the next tray up and leaving a gap. if i return , amazon shipping will be almost half of what the item cost. learned my lesson . I need to buy more of my stuff local."
5,Messy!,Product had plenty of trays to do a large job which I like. It does what they say it will. Timing is close to what is noted in book. We did a lot of beef jerkey but the cleanup was more than I expected. I don't think it would be different with a different machine unless maybe stainless.
1,Jaundice eyed reading,"My understanding of how Natural Selection works came primarily from ""The Blind Watchmaker"" by Richard Dawkins. This author seems to have read this book and I'm surprised he hasn't even attempted to understand how Natural Selection works! If he did, he would have probably decided to quite being the fanatic that he was.If you truly want to understand how nature works then this book is definitely NOT recommended. Instead buy something like the ""Blind Watchmaker"" by Richard Dawkins."
1,Cans arrived dented and unsuable,I do like the taste of this soup as I have purchased this in the past at the grocery store. I haven't been able to find it so when I saw this offered on Amazon I ordered several cases. To my disappointment all but 3 of the cans were severly dented and one was actually leaking. Amazon immediately sent replacements but sadly they arrived in the same condition. I'm not sure if this problem originated in the warehouse or was the result of poor packaging and shipping. The only reason I gave this one star is because of the superior customer service I received from Amazon. I will try this item again at a later date to see if they have corrected the problem.
2,Could be a lot better.,"I just came back from Mardi Gras and had Gumbo/Jambalaya and all the other great food. I was sure this wasn't going to be that good but it tasted fine. The biggest problem I have is the picture that shows big chunks of okra, vegetables and sausage. There were only two chunks of any kind of vegetables in there one tomato and one celery. No Okra at all, and only one small piece of sausage and a few strands of meat of any kind. I don't know if that's what it takes to make it healthier (cheaper to produce). It probably wouldn't be too bad if you added more rice (small amount compared to New Orleans version I had) and your own sausage pieces, okra and misc. vegetables. It isn't bad tasting just disappointing ""presentation"" vs. what you receive. It is a base basically not a stew or soup."
2,Needs serious improvement,"I generally like or love Healthy Choice products and appreciate their wholistic food approach. But this gumbo is truly mediocre. Problems go on and on. Healthy Choice products frequently take several tastes to fully appreciate the healthiness and taste (there certainly are more tasty products than any Healthy Choice product I've tried). But after tasting a full dozen of these, I still regret its purchase."
5,Important contribution,"I purchased this book some time ago, but only recently read it. When I picked it up again, I figured that this book on alchemy, published by a mainstream press, was likely to be just new-age hogwash.I was pleasantly surprised.This book addresses alchemy as a spiritual system (the author compares it in the back briefly to tantra), based on meditation and sexuality. The book is packed with meditations and poetic explorations of the existing alchemical literature and paintings, and while it does not provide a firm intellectual foundation for the study of alchemy, I think it brings us one step closer to its essence.I don't think this should be the only book one has on alchemy if one wants to study it, but it is a useful addition to any library addressing Renaissance spirituality, alchemy, hermetics, etc."
3,Disappointing...,"Don't get me wrong. It's not bad listening, but I feel like U2 kind've sleepwalked through this one. I'd rather listen to Atchung Baby any day. Beautiful Day is a great one to wake up to though, if you have one of those CD alarm clocks."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I HOPED,"Well, don't let me be misunderstood. It's a good album but when it comes to U2 you always expect the best of their yet...Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree are the best albums U2 made and of course people will always compare it with this one. But indeed there are some really good tracks here like 'Beautyful Day' 'Walk On' and 'In a Little While' but the second part is weak. If you are new to U2, buy Achtung Baby or Joshua Tree first."
4,Great music...so-so lyrics when compared to previous.....,"Unlike most U2 fans, i didn't get into them until after The Joshua Tree. And boy I missed out because i didn't see that concert when they came to Miami, supposedly one of the best shows ever. Even to this day, songs like Bullet the Blue Sky, One Tree Hill, and Heartland give me goosebumps. Back to the review.....i'll make it short and sweet....ATYCLB has great music and supposedly satisfies those ""original"" U2 fans unhappy with Pop, longing for a return to the style of TJT and TUF. Despite the lackluster sales of Pop, i felt that it had some of the best lyrics of all their albums. ATYCLB doesnt have the same quality lyrics as past U2 works. Regardless, the music is powerful and makes you want to move. This is definitely an album to buy. But it may not keep its timeless replayability like TJT, AB, the end of R&H, or TUF."
4,U2's long awaited comeback ! respect !!!,"i'm reading some of these reviews, and i'm thinking... what's going on with your ears, people ? i think a few of you need to go an buy some q-tips because this is one of the best albums the band has ever done. granted, it doesn't sound exactly like ACHTUNG BABY or JOSHUA TREE, but who would want it to ? like everyone has said before, it is certainly a return to form for U2 yet nothing you've heard before.i must say it lacks the cohesion of ACHTUNG, JOSHUA or WAR for that matter, but it's a striking collection of beautiful and intelligent music, and in the age of britney and n'sync, we could all use more of that."
5,U2 of old and new,"For fans that have liked U2 for nearly two decades or more, this album makes you feel like you've grown up along side the band. I wouldn't compare it with Joshua Tree or Achtung. It stands on its own merit. While the passion of Bono's vocals is a throw back to the way he knows how to sing best, the music goes to place the band has never been before with its melodies. The cd feels both raw and polished. None of these songs will probably be my favorite, but the whole album works together so well. This album is a must have."
2,Where's U2 gone...?,"U2 is one of my all-time favorite bands, and even if they retire today, or make music that is nothing less than horrific from here on, that won't change. It was with no shortage of excitement that I grabbed up a copy of ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" back in October of 2000, but the result was severely underwhelming. Apart from some of their earliest albums, this is my least-used U2 disc. I know the critics are ranting and raving, and have been since its release nearly two years ago, but I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth. Where are those guys that gave us ""The Joshua Tree,"" ""Rattle and Hum,"" and ""Achtung Baby""? This stuff is just a little too formless and boring. I can only hope that U2's next offering will feel like, well, U2. This is only a decent album - and I know the guys can do better. I've heard it."
2,Syrupy and simple,"Bono's vocals are troubling in this album. Some of the songs sound like they came right out of the 1960s! The songs are rambling and almost 'forced' and exasperated, and lack intensity and passion, two things Achtung Baby was loaded with.This is NOTHING like Joshua Tree, either."
2,A bad parody of their better music,"There are 3 good songs on the CD and even they don't stand up to even the worst songs on War, Joshua Tree, October, Boy, Achtung Baby, etc. For some reason when I hear the lyric with the word ""rocket ship"" I just wince. The problem with U2 is that their past is a tough act to follow. They have at least 6 CDs in which virtually all the songs are fabulous. Oh well, nothing lasts forever (except the greatness of their previous work)."
2,"Better than ""Pop""...","All that you can't leave behind definately goes back to U2's original roots ( musically) but other than that, it just isn't what they used to be. They seemed to have lost that panache that we all loved them for back in the 80's. Beautiful Day is a wonderful single that leaves you feeling ""enlightened"" in a sense. But the rest of the CD is the same old tuff repeated over again, just to a different tempo. I hope that one day U2 will return to being the band that we all fell in love with. The band that wrote and sang about all the injustice in the world that brought what everyone was thinkng about, but to scared to say, to the surface waters. They made people stop and think about all the injustices going on in the world around us that we seem to ignore or play stupid to! Save your money - just buy the ""Beautiful Day"" single."
4,"Welcome back, boys!","ALL RIGHT! Those last 2 releases (ZOOROPA and POP) were really testing my patience. This one has its shortcomings (like the drum machine on ""Beautiful Day,"" the opening track. GRRR!), but this is U2 I grew up with back in the 80's. It grows on you too. The first time I listened to it I kept listening for a ""Pride"" or ""One"" absolutely stellar single. ""Stuck in a Moment"" is very good, but not up there with ""Sunday Bloody Sunday."" And that's fine; the rest of the songs fill in the picture for you. Let us all welcome The Edge as a co-lyricist on a couple of the numbers too! TURN IT UP!"
3,Some of this you could leave behind,"I've enjoyed this album, especially the first several tracks, but in all I find it less than inspired. ""Beautiful Day"" is a good anthem for appreciating life in the moment, and ""Elevation"" is a good rocking ride. I can sing along to ""Stuck in a Moment ..."" and ""Walk On"", but sometimes they bore me. Some rave reviews had me hoping ""Leave Behind"" would be as solid as Achtung Baby, but I for one was disappointed."
4,GREAT album...not quite 5 stars,"I think this album is very good. Beautiful Day is an invigorating song. Elevation makes you want shake it. Stuck in a Moment is one of those songs that should be ranked among the best that U2 has EVER done. However, after the first 5 songs, it sort of sounds like U2 does go through the motions. Although the first half of the cd is better...the whole cd is good."
2,Snooze-Fest,"I have been a longtime fan of U2 (introducing my entire dorm floor to ""Boy"") but this album is a major letdown. There is enough music today that is designed to induce sleep. U2 did not need to join those ranks. Where's Edge's guitar on this album? If you are a 12-year-old who think's Bono and his voice are ""dreamy,"" this album is for you. If you appreciate what U2 used to be, don't say you weren't warned."
2,Beautiful Day. Is there anything else?,"After hearing ""Beautiful Day"" I thought they were back. I'm not expecting Joshua Tree caliber out of them, but I was hoping for something on par with Achtung Baby. At least that album had some fire and originality in it. The remaining songs are consistently bland, go nowhere, and leave your mind a wandering. Really disappointing."
2,faceless and replaceable,"U2 are a commercial monster, but it had never mattered to me, because, say, ""acrobat"" was as comforting as swimming in the sea or reading poetry... I bought the new album today and I am really shocked. It is almost completely devoid of soul and courage. This could be any band from the us or uk. It is neither brilliantly cynical nor painfully honest. I wish there was one single song that touched me..."
1,"Old, socially conscious U2 fans disappointed.","If you like the older, social commentary style of U2 music, this release is not for you. This was the first U2 I had bought in a few years and now I can remember why. This is definately a pop sell out album. I guess they had fallen behind in the castle and sportcar payments. YAWN. Too bad I did not think to save my money."
1,as bad as everything they've done recently,"This album started the U2 decline, at least in terms of art. Half an album is just filler. It includes probably their worst tunes ever - Grace, In A Little While and Wild Honey -. The hype worked at that time, but not anymore. Fans have realised they were fooled by this mainstream product."
2,The sellout begins...,"This is it,folks, this is the album where it all changed for u2-from a creative musically interesting group of artists that never liked to stick to one sound for too long to a corporate pop singles-driven commodity..this album has no spark at all,only beautiful day is worth anything at all on this pointless collection of synthetic nostalgia throwbacks..just an excuse to sell-out stadiums..might as well you already sold out your integrity,u2..time for another i-pod commercial,lads?If only the bono of the 80's could see what he's become today..."
5,Simply Amazing,"This album is simply a masterpiece. I can honestly say that I appreciate every song and that the album is a close second to Joshua Tree. For U2 fans, it is a must own. My favorite song is Walk On, 'cause the lyrics are thoughtful and so true."
4,Good CD if you haven't heard it all yet...,"I was skeptical when I made my purchase but I was happy after listening to the CD. I am not a big U2 fan but this is a good CD. There are a few more good songs on the cd other than the ones currently being played on the radio if you are patient. ""In a little while"" is a great song.The heart of the CD is what is already being played on the radio. If you are tired of those songs than you may want to save your money... I bought this CD before ""Elevation"" started getting played hourly on every radio station across the country."
4,As beautiful as a Summer's Eve?,"Cleansing. A spiritual reawakening. As reinvigorating as a fresh pot of morning java. After scaling the heights of utter stupidity with POP!, U2 has returned to form nicely. This CD makes you want to relieve yourself, it's so relaxing. Go ahead, let loose. Bono will lead you."
5,The Best U2 album in a while,"If you like Joshua Tree and Unforgetable Fire and Achtung Baby. Just buy ""All that U Can't Leave Behind."""
1,"""All that you can't leave behind"", except maybe this album!","This has to be a low point in U2's recording history. A fan since the early years, they've dampened my enthusiasm with this latest installment. Worthy of note are tracks 1, 3 and 9. The rest can be relegated to the 'B sides'! What happened to creative genius and imagination. Some of the lyrics are diabolically bad (New York!?! - what the hell!) Hard to believe that this same band released The Joshua Tree."
2,"Very forgettable, not even a spark much less a fire","U2 has managed to hang onto their massive popularity for a good long time now, with passing decades and styles. For that I give them credit. Obviously they know full well what they are doing and do not need my support. However, as a music fan, I'm still not sold on the music that U2 are peddling these days. In stark comparison to their '80's pomp-rock classics, their current work seems soulless, lifeless and even worse, just plain dull. There isn't any of the anger that defined (to me, anyway) their sound. A good friend explained to me that an aging millionaire can no longer sing the blues. That rings true enough insofar as either of us know. But that also doesn't mean that the music will mean as much. It doesn't, not at all. U2 are now a fairly pleasant pop rock band, nothing more, in my opinion."
1,frightful dreck,"So bad it could bust my speakers and burn my stereo upon contact. U2 was a moderately talented but marginally inspired band whose day has long since passed. Even if released in '00, this album deserves it's place on one of those dreadful ""best of the nineties"" CD's that've been going around."
3,We want U2 to be relevant,"...but they aren't anymore. Yeah, Achtung Baby was a masterpiece. So was Joshua Tree. We like the idea of a comeback more than the comeback itself. And though these songs are decent, they sound like outtakes from the Achtung Baby sessions. Which would be cool if it was 1992, but it's 2001. I've given this disc plenty of spins and overall it doesn't hold up and thrill you after the first five or six times. I don't deny their need to make a living, and if they feel challenged that's great too, but this is fairly routine muzak stuff compared to their earlier stuff. Well-done muzak with one of the best rock vocalists of all time, but still muzak. Musicians can only be breakthrough artists for so long."
1,"yuck!! Hypocrisy, thy name is YOU TOO.","This pop collection is designed for those young at heart (but with graying temples) who gorge themselves full and cheat regularly on their mates (yet want to show how sensitive they are by crying to Christmas inspired songs).Seriously, this pseudo-music is the final proof that U2 are comparable to backstreet boys: they want your love, love,love and your money.to think that they used to write songs about social injustice..."
3,Sit down and give it a listen,"This one is that type of cd that gets better with each listen, i would have wished for it to just grab me at the first one, but so far i have listened to it 4 times and i keep discovering new things that interest me. I expected something like pop or zooropa but you won't get that in here, instead you get beautiful ballads to just sit and listen to. I gave it 3 stars cause i believe it's not up to u2's highest standards, it's a decent record but it lacks the energy, creativeness, and guitars of previous efforts. It reminds of the first time i heard achtung baby! i just wanted to dance like a mad man and play air guitar all through the record. Anyway ATYCLB is still a great alternative to all that Britney, Backstreet, Matchboz 20 and all that crap i know you hate.. so better give it a listen and decide for yourself."
2,dud...,"the songs on this record follow one of 2 formulas: Bono talks his way thru a pompous lyric over a bed of synths and Edge's echoey guitar, Bono talks his way thru the first minute/2 minutes and then the chorus comes blasting at you. these songs have no melodies whatsoever. as a result, the songs are duuuulll. Peace On Earth and especially, Grace...are stupifying. Grace is deadly, deadly dull. Bono's lyrics are mostly just bad poetry. the exceptions are Elevation(which is great)and Wild Honey(which is eh). this cd is wildly overpraised."
1,once a great band,"Having been a U2 fan for years, I was looking foreward to the release all that you can't leave behind because it was the band's first album in 3 and half years. I got the CD when it came out hoping for an album like boy, war or the joshua tree. Beautiful Day was a pretty good song and I expected U2 to return to their 80s roots. Unfortately, all that you can't leave behind lacked the emotion, drive or creativity that marked previous U2 efforts. I had difficulty making it through the album because there was little to keep my attention.Hopefully U2 will get it right next time but until then I will be listening to the Unforgettable Fire"
1,Snoozerama,"I wish they'd left this album behind. The first single ""Beautiful Day"" isn't bad, but the rest will just put you to sleep. Soft, sparse electro-beats and self-help platitudes do not make a great record. Where's the depth? Where's the emotion? I think I'll let this one collect dust on the shelf while I listen to Joshua Tree one more time."
2,ugh,"I really dont like this cd. There are a few great songs on it like spanish eyes and elevation, but other than that, I really dont understand the hype its getting. Now, dont get me wrong, I absolutely adore U2 and think they are musical geniuses ... but this cd just doesnt cut it for me...."
3,resigned to middle age,"I've been a fan of U2 from the very beginning, and albums like ""The Unforgettable Fire"" and ""Joshua Tree"" were undeniably groundbreakers in the rock world. But ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" is not among them. Yes, they've written some memorable songs, but one must simply accept the fact that they've mellowed with age, fame, and, perhaps, wealth. The fire doesn't burn the way it did. And maybe that's what the album conveys more than anything else; that as time passes so do the rough edges that gave birth to a band who's gift to all of us will never be forgotten."
1,Horrible,Amazing that these guys advertise themselves as the worlds greatest rock band.....when they aren't ROCK!!!! These losers are an insult to ROCK!
2,"As bad as ""Pop"" ?","As an old U2 fan, I was waiting for this new album for some impatience. ""Pop"" was a *terrible* attempt to make something techno. Those guys should have sticked to what made their success in the 80's... Now, ""All that you can't leave behind"" is just a juxtaposition of junk music. Maybe 2 or 3 singles are good, the others just don't cut the mustard. Very far away from ""Achtung Baby"", ""Joshua Tree"" or even ""War"". 2 stars, isn't that too much ?"
3,Where it all began,"Tell you what, blokes, this U2 album is where it all began for the band. Being from Ireland, I would know.""All That One Cannot Leave Behind"" by U2 is a shimmering rock record CD album chock full of gorgeous melodies and Paul's outstanding singing. My tops on this offering include ""New York,"" a sober take on fidelity, and the heartwrenching ""Beautiful Day,"" the song that began it all for these Irish studmuffins.What else is there to say, blokes? If you can't appreciate this top-notch band, then just go back to your Creed and Bush records.Me, I'm a U2 man, and I certainly can't wait to see what the bright future holds for these up 'n' coming rebel rockers.I've enjoyed posting this note on this message board - please respond so I can get other opinions. Am I the first to review this awesome record?? That's really hard to believe, but I guess most people just don't get what ""real rock"" truly is. If you're reading this, then I guess you know the score.BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Save your money,Im a big fan so this album was frustrating to listen to. Beautiful Day is a great song and New York and Grace are good songs with some new ideas but the rest of the album was very disappointing!! Bono and U2 pulled a Michael Bolton on this one;there was little new music to be heard.
1,very disappointing,"Well, don't get me wrong. There are a few good songs on this cd (like the first single 'Beautiful Day'), but the rest is all uninspired and washed up. What was supposed to be a return to their (glorious) roots turns out as a shallow copy of the beautiful music they have once put out. That's the worst thing about this album: there's not even the slightest innovation or development in their sound, all you'll ever hear on this album has been here before. My advice: buy the single if you like it, but stay away from the album...better stick to U2's previous releases (Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby,...)."
2,Nope!,"Oh, how it pains me to give U2 two stars...but I must. As much as I respect this band for constantly reinventing its sound, always experimenting with new ideas and music genres, I'm disappointed in this cd. With the exception of Beautiful Day (which is a brilliant song, beautifully arranged), there was nothing else on this effort that piqued my interest, or made me care about the music at all. That said, I must admit I was never a big fan of The Joshua Tree (I'm not afraid to admit it), so if you like that album you'll probably love this one. I just couldn't get into it...sorry guys."
1,YOU CAN NEVER GO HOME AGAIN!,"I awaited this album with great trepidation. The reviewers were quick to laud it as rocks saving grace, a return to when instrament and lyrics combined to tell a story, lift emotions and inspire. What I recieved was the antithesis of all the pundits glowing reviews. "" Beautiful Day"" is the only track that has any artistic merit whatever. If you are looking for vintage U2 try thier Greatest Hits, released last year with a companion disk of B-sides and covers that is a true return to rocks melodious side. It will be easy for me to leave this tripe behind."
3,"""Beautiful Day"" was great but then...","I thought ""Beautiful Day"" was an awesome single. But the rest of the album is crap. I guess their creativity is long gone. Not since ""Auctung Baby"" have they come up with a decent album."
4,"U2 returns with a soulful look at the world, quality songs","In this release from Irish rock superstars U2, Bono's voice is not what it once was, but U2's musical textures and Bono's songwriting skills have not been left behind. The popular single Beautiful Day starts the album, and other tuneful tracks include In A Little While, Walk On, & Stuck In A Moment. The album is oddly prescient of the September 11 events of 2001, and Bono has tunes such as New York, New York, Peace On Earth, & When I Look At The World. While much popular music is formulaic and insipid, U2 continues to be poetic and thoughtful while crafting memorable songs. This album is an excellent addition to rock/pop music collections and a must for U2 fans."
5,U2's finest hour.,"I bought this CD because I had heard ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Elevation"" and because I'm a huge U2 fan. When I first listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed. After really listening to it a few more times I have come to the conclustion that this is U2's finest effort to date.There isn't a bad track on this whole CD. From the high-energy rock sound of ""Elevation"" to the intense emotion of ""Peace on Earth"", they're all awesome. I think that my favorite track is ""Kite"". The lyrics are heartfelt and really stick with you.I have every U2 studio album, a few CD-singles, and a few of their live albums as well - this is the best of them all."
3,Is it all that you can leave behind? - Well no,"First impressions are that the album is bland, but after a few plays it starts to grow on you. I'm sure in a few weeks time I'll add another star. At the moment the single ""Beutiful Day"" is a favorite, but Elevation will make a better release.In A Little While is the best track.Is that Lou Reed on guest vocals at the start of Walk On? :^)"
5,A new classic is born (Man..we needed this),"The best since Achtung Baby! A masterpiece.(For those who gave the album one star, I'm sure you all have Britney and NSync posters all over your room. Appreciate the best band around)"
5,"Remember everyone, we are not reviewing movies here","I wish that the people who didn't like this album wouldn't ...it but lovingly put it down. I mean, good lord, ""Beautiful Day"" stayed at number one for a few weeks, U2 must be doing something right. I have the album and love it, but people who put down ATYCLB like it has the same quality music as an N'Sync album need to loosen up. If you don't like it, say it, but not in an overexaggerated way. That's all I have to say."
4,NOT BETTER THAN ACTHUNG OR JOSHUA BUT A LOT BETTER THAN POP!,"After the somewhat disappointment of Pop, U2 decided they would do what they do best. So me and millions of people got excited. Teamed back with Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, U2 are back! The first seven songs are very good but then comes 'Peace on Earth' and 'When I look at the World' which, well... are not so good. 'New York' is decent and 'Grace' is a good song to close the album.Overall, it's a very good record!"
2,Expected MUCH more from U2,"I have been a huge U2 fan since War, and I was really excited when they released this album. But I have to say that it is not one of their greatest efforts in my opinion. The keyboards are a bit amplified on most songs, and Bono seems to have become a little tone-deaf in his old age. I don't know why, but his vocals seem a little weak and off-key. If you love U2, I recommend you listen to this cd somewhere before buying it for yourself, otherwise you may be in for a surprise. Beautiful Day was my favorite from this CD, and most of the other songs sound similar to each other and are just boring. U2 is still the greatest though!"
3,"Pure pop... listenable, but rather souless.","Is this a bad album? No. Is there much to set it apart from other alt-pop chart-chasers? (matchbox 20, goo goo dolls, etc.) Unfortunately, no. It is very listenable, and very ""catchy"".. but if you liked being challenged by your music, this album is not for you.. it is all easy and spoon-fed to you. It sounds as if the album was written purely to get on corporate radio to rake in the $$$.. and that's where the money is. I think the best track on here is ""In a Little While"". If you're new to U2, pick up The Joshua Tree or Zooropa for their best works."
1,"Over produced, over rated and under done","I bought into the media hype and bought this one thinking it was some kind of rebirth for U2. From the interviews, they sound embarassed by their work over the past few albums and felt they needed to 'rock' again. I'm not sure what they think they recorded but what they released is dull and lazy. The lyrics amazed me. It's like they aren't even trying anymore."
1,Bloody terrible,"I was a U2 fan since Joshua tree (1987) but THIS is the worst U2 album in their entire career!Pathetic, hypocrite and dejavu - it's TOTALLY forced record.Like someone said, they were doing auto-pilot recording.The lyrics are also the worst ever - Bono has never written so pathetic and hypocrite lyrics!Definitely - All the things you must leave behind - if you want to listen to U2 again and not to get sick or irritated.The last 'real U2' album was Zooropa."
2,On further listening...,"First let me say that I didn't much care for U2 prior to Achtung Baby. I didn't mind hearing them on the radio, but didn't feel the need to own anhy of their albums. Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop changed that. Each album charted new ground for the band; they were interesting if nothing else. This album puts U2 back on my ""don't need to buy"" list. Beautiful Day and Eleveation are the only stand out songs for me on this disc; everything else is at best okay to listen to, but not exciting. Some of it is just boring. I guess U2 has returned to their ""roots"", but without any real enthusiasm for it. The songs, as I said are almost all unoffensive, but none of them stick in your head afterword; kind of like rock muzak. Only a couple of songs are cringingly bad (Peace On Earth, Grace), with the lifeless music overwhelmed by even worse lyrics. I think long time U2 fanatics will like this very much, but if, like me, you only found U2 to be worth your time recently, avoid this disc"
3,"If excpectations weren't so high,this would be satisfying","All That You Can't Leave Behind was somehow a standard-jewel case for the critics but a dissapointment for most of the fans.It's not that this is a bad record.No,this is well-crafted rock stuff singed by the always admirable Bono voice.It's just that compared with their other recent offerings,this release seems more like a step behind than a step forward.With Pop U2 prooved to the whole world that they can sound equally good in almost every music field.All That You Can't Leave Behind ofcourse was never excpected to be either as good as their masterpiece Achtung Baby but the thing is that it doesn't even sound as fresh as Joshua Tree did at the time it came out.There are some good moments here for the fans to enjoy though such as Wild Honey,New York and Beautifull Day."
2,2nd impression,"really 2 and 3/4 stars. i fall into the category of the u2 fan that was initially disappointed by but willing to give this album a chance. after my first few listens i gave it a week off and then listened again. i now like it more than i did but do not consider it a strong release. i feel that the first several songs on it are good, but, there is what seems to be a good portion of this album where the songs really do fall short. it sounds like the band loses direction and these songs sound very formulaic, in both music and lyrics. i would consider it a possible transition album from their 90's work into whatever direction they take in the decade ahead. the ""greatest ever"" rave reviews for this album could be setting up unrealistic expectations for a majority of fans."
2,"I tried, I really did..","Folks, I really wanted to like this album. I tried. Is it just me or is ""returning to your roots"" music industry code for ""we don't know what to do next""? Most of these songs seem filable under Adult Contemporary, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with that, it's not my taste. I actually enjoyed all of the 90's experimentation, loved Zooropa, and the Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack had me really excited for this album. Unfortunately, it was not a taste of things to come. If it gives U2 some of their deserved credibility back, that's a good thing -- maybe they will be free to be more creative in their next outing. To sum up: if you're a 90's U2 fan, into current music and you enjoyed albums like Kid A, Stories From the City.., and Moon and Antarctica this year, this album will probably be a disappointment. If this description is opposite to you, you'll probably be overjoyed."
2,This fire is forgettable,"I grew up with this band back in the 80's and many of their earlier works were high school anthems for us. War, Boy, October, Red Rocks, etc... all electrified us. But I guess when you've done what this band has done then there's not much room for improvement - and this cd shows it. This cd lacks any emotion or chemistry. It clearly tries to pick up where Achtung Baby left off, but fails. It's basically, well....boring. Nothing here really rocks or moves the soul. Most of the cd just plods along, with a few peaks here and there, and then gracefully ends. Nothing can last forever and U2's ability to crank out masterpieces is no exception. I would have rated this cd a 1, but I like U2 and felt compelled to at least give it a 2 for effort."
5,just buy the cd!,"""ive been a fan since the 80's and all i can say is...this cd is pure poetry! i've already told my kids(9&11 yrs. old) that on my funeral, i want them to play ""kite"" and make sure that everyone has the lyrics...i still get goosebumps when i hear ""i know that this is not goodbye..."" anyway, i've read all the raves, reviews and reasons why U2 is so great...i always look for some new descriptions on how great their work is, whether it be on the internet, a book or a magazine. The fact is, the true fans, like myself, are so personally and emotionally close to them, that it's almost, scratch that.. it is...sheer poetry just how we rave about them! ever go to church and feel ""light-hearted"" afterwards?.... go to a U2 concert. ""The sky falls....and you feel like it's a ""beautiful day!!!"" ...just buy the cd!"
3,"Bono , give up the Ciggies","The thing that struck me about the two best known songs on this set is that Bono's voice seems shot. On a beautiful day and ""stuck in a moment there are acouple of bars of bad singing. Some of it is because the songwriting is bad some of it is because Bono voice isnt getting it done."
1,yawn,"the only good song on this album is beautiful day. the rest are all so boring, so plain, so lifeless, so ordinary. Those are not the reasons why i listen to u2. go get achtung baby instead, or war those are much, much, much more better. and i don't care what anybody elses says, i think 95% of the album is so boring, it's like i've heard it thousand times already before it even came out...i think probably u2 were sleeping wh ile writing all this album, hmmmmm"
4,What was left behind?,"This is a great album. It is a genuine four star album...but not a five star...not a Joshua Tree/Achtung Baby. And I can't quite put my finger on why. There are some great classic U2 songs on this album...Beautiful Day, Walk On, When I Look At The World...but there are also just as many songs that feel like U2 going through the motions. It just doesn't have the satisfaction that some of their best albums have. Their best albums come out of major internal conflict and fighting. They had actually decided to split up during the recording of Achtung, and The Edge picked up a guitar and started playing ""One."" Makes me wonder if this album came too easily for them."
4,I like this one...,"I'm not a big collector of U2 albums (this one's my fifth) but I really do like this one. I'll bet Lou Reed took notice of 'New York', and not just because of the title. It's uncanny how much I am reminded of his stuff by this track. Not to detract from U2, though. ' Grace' is so powerful that it's hard to listen to sometimes. If you've ever liked U2, then I'd give this one a listen. In any case, it'll grow on you..."
5,Fantastic!,"Just a wonderful CD. I had it for 3 days and it seems that it's on continual play in the CD player. Powerful and passionate and everything I could hope, want and expect from U2.Welcome back."
4,the real thing,"U2 has made a lot of great music in twenty years, which makes the power and emotion of this cd all the more remarkable. ATYCLB is like a compendium of what makes this Irish band stand head and shoulders above other artists: personal lyrics set to anthemic music ringing with the clarity of Edge's guitars. In fact, the Edge's role as sonic architect of U2 is really on display here, and I now see how important his role has been all along (and I have been a fan since 1983.) ATYCLB is all that makes music so vital to life because it reflects and focuses all that makes life what it is: the expectation and loss of love ('Walk On'); the eternal promise of tomorrow ('Beautiful Day'); how painful it is to see a friend destroy himself ('Stuck in a Moment.') All I can say is that we are the better for U2 keeping on, and do yourself a favor and go see them in 2001 on tour: you'll be glad you did."
2,Too forced,I have to agree with the last reviewer. This album really seems to lack imagination and creativity. Nothing like their earlier works. Sounds as if these guys were trying too hard to make an album full of great songs and missed the boat completely. Just doesn't have any life to it.
4,At first I did't get it...,"As a U2 fan of over 20 years, I had been hearing about how good this record was. It was being compared to some of the older U2 records. I didn't think it lived up to that praise based on the first single. Then I took a long drive in my car and while sitting in traffic I really got a chance to listen to this disc. It was really good. The strong lyrics composed by Bono are moving and indicative of someone that continues to grow with a more mature outlook. This is the best disc since 1991."
4,I'd like to hear something different...,"They get 4 stars because their lyrics are always compelling, and their sound is tight.But...this album is almost as disappointing as that horrid thing they did for City of Angels (great movie, horrible selection by U2). If this is the direction U2 is going to continue following, I'm not sure I'll buy their next album. It's pretty disappointing that they can continue phenomenal sales on every record--we keep buying because we hope we'll find the next Joshua Tree. It's not likely to happen anytime soon.Pop was supposed to be satirical. What's this album supposed to be?"
2,Not all that it's made out to be,"I don't know where these critics get off comparing this to U2's earlier days. This is not the creative music U2 used to make. U2 borrowed a lot of motown influence for this CD, and instead of going for something exciting, they ""stayed safe"" and made something that will inevitably sell more copy. I'm not impressed. There is nothing groundbreaking about this like the U2 of the Unforgettable fire or even Achtung Baby. One comment: Weak. Pure and simple."
3,U2... always solid but...,"The real question is: is U2 relevent anymore?I don't think so. I've enjoyed most of the band's output, barring some of the work in the 90s. But, to me at least, U2's purpose has been served; they have nothing more to say or do of any magnitude or interest. I can hear all of these songs on better albums.I suppose the best way to characterize the sentiment I have towards the new album is to illustrate by example: would a new Pink Floyd albyum, which tossed aside the AOR platitudes of the last two outings and returned to the sound of the mid-seventies, matter? It might be really good; I'd buy it and go see the tour. But it just can't be the same... it just can't be as important, or interesting, or relevant. Or whatever. The gestalt is lost though the elements are there.But they are good tunes that deserve some credit."
4,Clearly U2's Best Album,I don't ever have to listen to this album again to know it's true. Just look at the cover- they look like proper rock stars! No grubby wife beaters and daft cowboy hats. RRRROCK ON LADS!
3,Reinvented Again...disappointing result,"Well, U2 has reinvented itself again. Sorta kinda. Actually, the sound on display hear is a throwback to the more creative days of the band (the 1980s). Some of the songs could have appeared on Rattle and Hum or Joshua Tree. ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out of"" has reluctant energy and a good riff. ""In a Little While"" is okay and several others are passable. But most of this album sounds pretty tired. It isn't Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby. Nonetheless, it does represent a step forward from Pop and Zooropa. Worth a listen."
3,"Some peaks, some valleys","I'm sure Bono won't mind me using that heading, as most of his lyrics concern nature and the world and his somewhat cliched perspective of it. I like them as a band and as people they're nice. But that's irrelevant. The music here is U2. Edge's shimmer, Bono's soulful tunes and those other two... doing... stuff. Peace on Earth is absolutely rotten, as is Grace, and New York... rehashed, poorer Zooroopa/Joshua/Achtung...they know how to write a good one- Stuck In a Moment is the best one here, and it's as good as anything they've done. Buy this if you must... but I'd recommend Kid A by that other best band in the world...* wink wink nudge nudge* All together now- ""WE'VE GOT HEADS ON STICKS!"""
3,A former U2 fan speaks up,"I agree with other reviews that this ain't no Joshua Tree. U2's solid song-writing and lyrics with true yearning are over. This is my first album of theirs I have purchased since Joshua Tree. Some of the old sound is there, and heck, I purchase quite a bit of pop music in general. For more cutting edge stuff check out Juno, 764-HERO or Le Tigre."
2,A Disappointment,"I'm a huge U2 fan but this album is a disappointment. The songs are very mediocre by U2 standards and the album, as a whole has none of the passion and heart of past U2 efforts. It is not fair to expect a ""Joshua Tree"" or ""War"" every time but they can do better than this. Bono's voice sounds strained and some of his lyrics are just plain bad John Lennon/Beatles rip-offs (not the first time Bono has done this). The Edge's usual great guitar work is also absent here. U2 is a great band and are capable of recording fantastic music but this album is far from great."
4,U2 vs. A-ha,"The latest U2 Album certainly has the ability to grow on me. However, since having heard the first single ""Beautiful Day"", I can't get the stricking similarity between this song and A-Ha's hit single ""The Sun always shines on TV"" out of my head. Specifically when Bono bursts out ""Touch me"" in the chorus. Was this intentional? Perhaps it was: When U2 rendered a tremendous performance of the song at the MTV European Music Video Awards 2000 in Stockholm, Bono finished off by thanking the crowd and stating ""the sun always shines on TV""."
3,Just not very good...,"No doubt, U2 have made some very powerful music in their distinguished career. This is not such music. What is a group to do when they have reinvented themselves so many times? They have been a roots band and they have been a psuedo techno act. Now, they want to bring it full circle and the results are mediocre and dull. That is the best way to describe this CD: Dull! There are some good tunes here, but nothing soars like their best songs. ""Beautiful Day"" is sharp with it's pulsing beat, but the chorus is a little annoying. ""Wild Honey"" is maybe the most appealing song here because it sounds somewhat fresh. ""Elevation"" just sounds like leftovers from Pop. All of the songs are fair, but nothing leaps out of the speakers. Furthermore, Bono is not in good voice. In fact, he croaks through a few songs enough to make you wonder if he's got much left in the tank. Maybe that's part of the charm here, but I'm just not getting it."
3,Back To Basics,"Radiohead get round their songwriting poverty by developing initially startling soundscapes that simply don't belong on a rock record. U2 did a similar trick after they dried up following Achtung Baby and kept it up for almost a decade. While this kind of thing keeps the critics happy, it erodes the fan base, so the next rabbit out of the hat is a 'back to basics' approach. This album is basically U2 sans the smokes and mirrors. Gone is the messianic energy of the War and Joshua Tree years, leaving behind a group of skillful, glitzy, jaded musicians with some unfortunate affectations. Bono still thinks he can cut it as Marvin Gaye on 'Grace.' The main problem is that the melodies are pulling their punches trying not to step on the toes of other tunes, a sure sign a band is treading water. The two tracks carrying the album are the soaring, windswept 'Kite' and the recent single 'Beautiful Day' which struggles to break away from a looped feel, but doesn't quite manage it."
2,An exciting disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this album based on the pre-release reviews that the songs were reminiscent of Unforgettable Fire and I am real happy to report that the songs are indeed of that genre. Unfortunately the ""voice"" isn't. Bono's range is noticeably stretched on almost every track on this album and some of the songs seem to actually be written to accomadate his shortcomings. In addition, the production seems muddy, ala ""Exile on Main Street"". That style worked for the Rolling Stones; it does not work for U2. So, 4 stars for the songs less one for the vocals less one for the production equals a disappointing two stars."
2,What happened to you U2???,"Ever since Achtung Baby, U2's music has gotten from bad to worse. long gone are the days of their rebel, political albums, such as Boy, October, War, and The Unforgettable Fire. Enter the new U2, which to be me, is like a total other group. New U2 is a slap in the face to the ""old school"" fan. They're sappy lyrics grow on me like a fungus. This new album isn't terrible or aka POP, but it is not like the good ol' days..."
1,How to become a product within a brand,"On ATYCLB I skip over Beautiful Day, Stuck in a Moment, Elevation, Walk On, Kite, In a Little While, Wild Honey, Peace on Earth, When I Look at the World, New York and Grace.Deal with it, it's their worst ever U2 crap. Period."
1,...,"this album is so heartless and commercial that it baffles the mind. how could a band that made such outstanding music at one time in their career subject itself and its listeners to such overhyped crap! have you even listened to the music and lyrics to ""beautiful day"" and ""elevation?"" my god, you'd expect this from a sophomore effort, not from a band that's been around. supposedly, their intent was to move away from some of their recent experimental offerings once they realized that techno wasn't the hype everyone thought it was going to be and they needed a new bandwagon to jump onto. seeing the writing on the wall that their ""direction"" was nowhere, they opt for rehashing (or attempting to rehash) what they once were. totally disasterous. for bono to state that ""they're applying for the job as the best band in the world,"" is laughable. save us the time. radiohead and belle and sebastian beat you to it!"
2,This is one seriously overrated album (AND IT'S TOTALLY BORI,"Beatiful day was a good track. I really like it. The rest of the album............-sucked. All the songs, except for Beatiful, were trash. Completely boring. People who give this piece of trash five stars need to learn a liitle more about music. Boring Guitar Rhythms, boring drums, boring bass, and completely forgettable vocals. Lyrics are a lame attempt to be poetic and that about sums it up. Download beatiful day off of itunes or something, but forget about the rest of the album. I wasted my money big time on this disc. I haven't listened to it for like 5 years because it is just so pathetic. U2 IS CAPABLE OF MAKING SOME GOOD MUSIC, BUT WITH THIS DISC THEY FAILED."
4,This is a very good disc,"I've heard a lot of people talking about how wonderful adn how masterful U2's last 2 albums were. Personally, I think that they weren't. The techno feeling of both discs (Pop and Zooropa) just didn't seem like the same band that released such ballads like ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" or ""With or Without you"". This album however, goes back to basics in a sense. A lot of things are better about this album. The writing is fabulous for one thing. Also, the instrumentals aren't crammed into a fake beat like on the prevoius albums. The CD just sounds more natural, more real.This is a must have for all U2 fans, new and old. Whether you're a Joshua Tree era fan or a techno era fan, buy this CD."
4,This Album Rocks!!,"I've been a U2 fan ever since Joshua Tree came out many years ago. To me, their best album was Achtung Baby, I also really enjoyed POP, although It was probably one of their most badly taken albums.. The new album is really good, although I think its kinda weak. I really dig Beautiful Day, Walk on, Wild Honey, and When I look at the World, and probably about 2-3 other songs. Id say about 7 of the 11 tracks are really great and I would recommend this album to anybody who remotely likes U2.! ROCK ON!!"
4,Good but not great,"I was not blown away by this album, In my opinion, it just isn't as good as some of their others. They are supposed to be THE greatest prophets in music. I think the album will grow on me, but I must admit I am diisssapointed. Maybe they have another album up their sleeves. I hope so. In short, good but not great. It's still definitely worth buying though. Bono's lyrics just aren't as sharp as usual. I will always love U2, but they can't just be one of the best, they have to be THE best"
5,Back With A Bang,"U2 is back with a bang, releasing an album that takes the best from the experimental sounds it toyed with in it's last 3 albums and combining them with the unbelievable music of their roots. This process has, in my opinion, produced their best album since Joshua Tree. Bono has contributed some of the most soul-stirring lyrics of his career and The Edge has brought back the guitar riffs that only he could produce. This is the first masterpiece of the new millenium!"
2,A BIG STEP BACKWARDS,"After covering new ground with Pop, U2 have opted to take a step backwards and deliver a collection of songs which sound like their older efforts, only not as good. It leaves you thinking, why bother? If all they want to do is rehash their old stuff, why not just release the second half of their greatest hits collection, do a few stadium gigs and be remembered fondly, rather than going downhill. And as for ""Beautiful Day"", has nobody ever listened to Ah-Ha's ""The Sun Always Shines On T.V."" ?? (obviously U2 have!!)"
3,"""Don't let it get away...""","All That You Can't Leave Behind by U2 was sort of a comeback album from this popular band. Bono is a excellent songwriter and singer, the songs I do appreciate include: Beautiful Day, Elevation, Stuck in a Moment and You Can't Get Out of It, and Walk On. This album is pretty average, not as special as The Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby but worth purchasing if you are fan of this timeless band."
3,Not half bad.,"This album is'nt half bad, except ""Grace"" and ""Wild Honey"" ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Stuck In a moment"" are'nt exactly what you would call rock songs.Some people are coming back to this album and crticising it as the point where U2 just became interested in money and being stars and not caring about the music, but thats not all true with this album.""Walk On"" ""Elevation"" ""Kite"" and ""When I Look At The World"" are all classic U2 songs.But now we have ""How To Dismantle An Atmomic Bomb"" which is the worst U2 album ever, and such a dissapointment.Its not a great album, but it had its moments."
4,Good buy for extra song,"For a review of 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', see the non-limited addition reviews. As for this particular limited edition version, the extra song included is ""Summer Rain"". Note that some other vendors are also selling their own ""exclusive"" limited editions which include the song ""Always"". Note that both of these are on the ""Beautiful Day"" single (#1).That said, ""Summer Rain"" is probably the better of the two songs. Musically, it is primarily acoustic and fairly simple, and lyrically, it fits in with the direction assumed on songs like ""New York"" on ""All That You Can't Leave Behind."" This extra track probably could have been included on the record with some additional work on the lyrics to the second verse. Nonetheless, it is one of U2's stronger b-sides and makes a nice addition to the record for the extra $."
5,"Simple, straight forward, shimmering production","This is by far the most mature U2 album. It sparkles from start to finish. Each and every song has a great melodic hook. Why are some of you so stuck on U2 going back to their old style? Ridiculous. In my opinion this is the album that U2 should be most proud of having written. It's subtle. It's fantastically produced with all kinds of interesting inuendos. The songs have great simple melodies. Finally Bono sounds like he has grown up. New York almost sounds like Lou Reed. For those of you who don't care who U2 were, this is a brilliant and mature, mellow and intraspective album. Simply great."
5,I love it to death,"I'm not a huge U2 fan, I've never owned another of their cd's, never seen them in concert. But once I heard Beautiful Day on the radio, I knew I would keep listening for other singles from this album, just because I never buy a cd off of 1 track. More singles followed, and my love for them grew. I got this for Christmas, and it is one of my 2 new favorite cd's. The songs are uplifting, like Beautiful Day, Walk On and my favorite, Elevation. There's a certain something here, it's not sad, it's an uplifting (I know I've said that before but it's true) album, with it's more upbeat moments, and it's quieter ones. All in all, it's made me want more U2."
5,ATYCLB Rocks this world,"U2's latest album brings a mixture of the last 20 years into one album. Apart from being stripped down the album is also full of layers of sound which take a listening to get used to. An album which appeals to all who listen to music, this album is deceptively simple. Yet a closer listening will unveil a complex construction of both lyric and sound. With tracks like New York bringing home the reality of everyday life to Elevation which sends you into a flurry of excitement for no apparent reason other than the song, this album will re-introduce you to the world of Rock as you've never seen it before. Five stars."
5,U2 At The Height Of Their Powers,"This disk will grab you by the throat. For longtime U2 fans, or for music lovers looking for a return to mainstream rock and roll, this CD delivers the goods.U2 are not known for their singles, but in a market crying out for something other than Eminem, Korn, Metallica, or the kiddie corps (Aguilera/Spears/boy bands), there are 2 or 3 songs that could get some play.Each song on the album gets better with multiple playings. Stuck In A Moment is infectious. Elevation rocks like Desire or Even Better Than the Real Thing. In A Little While has soul - like maybe Keith Richards snuck into the studio. Grace is simply beautiful - it will move a live audience like 40.BUY THIS MUSIC! You won't regret it."
2,Lounge-U2,"They phoned this one in. This may be the most pedestrian, uninspired album U2 has yet produced. It isn't so much bad as it is lukewarm. U2 has offered surprises before -- some jarring, some delightful -- but there are none of those here. It doesn't reward close attention at all, with little to either love or hate. Get the ""Beautiful Day"" single if you must, but leave the rest of it alone. Any mediocre band could have given us this album. We didn't need U2 to do it."
4,flashback.....,"This is the latest U2 album.. after having thoroughly listened to it, I think that it is a great sonic return to the days of ""Joshua Tree""s past. I may not be a professional music reviewer, but as a radio DJ and music lover, I find this album to be extremely textured in the way that was absent in Pop or Zooropa. My favorites are definitely ""walk on"" and ""wild honey"", both great songs. I bought this CD when it came out (a few weeks ago) and it has not left any CD playing device since."
4,one song that makes the entire album. . .,"this cd brings U2 back to the forefront of music, exactly where they should be. though songs like ""Elevation"", ""kite"", and ""grace"" make this album great, the shining song on this record is ""In a little while."" this is a truly beautiful song that only U2 could create. It moves the heart with every listen."
2,Not worth all the hype,"After all the hype leading up to this album, I was extremely disappointed in the end result. Sure everyone agrees 'Beautiful Day"" is a great song, but the rest of the album is musically and lyrically boring. Anyway look for them at a stadium near you."
3,Beautiful Day - The rest of the cd you CAN leave behind.,Beautiful Day is a return to the U2 of yesteryear. This single will be a world wide smash. The rest of the songs on the cd are lack luster at best. The cd suffers from a shift from U2 the music based band to U2 the Bono vocal showcase band. This effort might have been best released as a world conscious book of prose with your choice of charitable organization to submit to.
2,"Too shallow, too bright","This new album is above all a disappointment after the brilliant ""pop"" album. ""Pop"" was dark, full of pain, fear & confusion. U2 tried to experiment with different kinds of electronic music and disturbing rhythms. They captured the chaos of modern times. This new album lacks the seriousness and depth of ""pop"". The songs about world problems (when I look at the world, peace on earth) don't convince as much as ""wake up dead man"" on ""pop"". If you like the more happier music, I suppose this record appeals more than Pop. But if you like the darker, yet richer of meaning, stuff. Go back and listen to Pop. This new one sounds all too familiar. Some songs sound like you heard them before. Are we sure ""beautiful day"" is a new song ?"
2,Worthless!!!!,"I thought U2 was nice, hearing the radio I never thought of the fact that the album could be a complete letdown. Well, I should have done that. I bought this, and it sucks, the first five songs are good, but then....:C, not good at all. Next time, I'll stick with the hits, and that is exactly what you should do. Here's my tracklist rating:Beautiful Day: 8/10Stuck In A Moment: 10/10Elevation: 10/10Walk On: 8/10Kite: 8/10In A Little While: 5/10Wild Honey: 1/10Peace On Earth: 2/10When I Look At The World: 1/10New York: 1/10Grace: 1/10See what I mean? Keep On Rocking!!!!"
2,Not really all that great,"This record is really pretty average if you ask me. Every single was really fairly average and when I finally heard the CD at work it really sounded terrible. It sounds like some really average new adult alternative band or it sounds like a band fading away and fast. I guess U2 did take a step forward from the last album, but that isn't saying much because the last album was so bad. Just look for War, Achtung Baby, and Joshua Tree before you go out and buy this album."
2,I don't get it,"I never understood the attraction that most people have for this band. They spend way to much time polishing mediocre tunes. Although produced very nicely, the songs on thier own do not hold up. Sorry folks, but I just don't get it."
5,Awesome,I love U2 and this album is a MUST have in the U@ collection. It has excellent sound quality and everything you could expect from U2
5,Everything that popular music can be.,"Beautiful simple melodies with intricate layerings ofsound. The purity of choral arrangements with the energyand beat of rock. Less a collection of songs than a series ofepiphanies. ""Walk On"" has to be one of the greatest rock songs of all time.Underneath it is a pure and elegantmelody for voice and chorus. Music for a future liturgy.Amen."
4,"Amazing Lyrics, Amazing Music","U2's ""All that You Can't Leave Behind"" feels at first like a return to the U2 of the ""Joshua Tree"" Days. However, a closer examination of the album reveals a much deeper U2, a U2 that has survived and come to terms with a lot in their lives.That's not to say that this album is perfect-- I'll admit that I really didn't like the album at first, and I was very disappointed at the apparent shallowness of the album. But this is one of those albums that grows on you, and I found myself listening more closely to the lyrics, and to the music, and liking it more and more.Gone are the days of sappy love songs-- instead the band confronts their greatest failings, including Bono's apparent infidelity (in the song ""New York""). But unlike Achtung Baby, which was also a very confontational album, the darkness and bitterness has vanished-- in fact, despite the somtimes depressing lyrics, the music has an overall hopeful tone to it."
2,It's Over,"How can the mighty have fallen so far? One of the greatest bands in the world has devolved into a mockery of itself - the U2 I knew and loved is long dead and this is far from a suitable epitaph. The Irish lads promised this would be a return to their classic style, with The Edge's beautiful, ringing guitar standing out once more; I can't hear it, at least not for more than a few seconds. The album offers up three ""good"" tracks, and they all pale in comparison to what this formerly great band produced in its heyday - ""Beautiful Day,"" ""Elevation,"" and ""New York."" Everything is forgettable, missing even the incisive lyrics this band once wrote so well. I really had hoped this album would be a return to form after U2's terrible spiral throughout the 90's - instead, it's some half-hearted attempt to become something new again, and a failure at that. Goodbye U2, it was great while it lasted."
5,back and better than ever,"to have a cumulative rating of only 4 stars is an atrocity. this is easily tied with if not better than ""the Joshua Tree"" Bono's lyrics have reflected what we have all come to feel iin the past year and they wer written long befor 9/11. Bonos knew before hand what we all had to learn the hard way. The lyrical content of this album tkaes us back to the times of WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME and PRIDE. Bono's ability to continue to come up with new ideas and put them into lyricas that are broad enough to fit into ewach of our own intepretations yet still allow part of the tru message to be heard has no doubt resurfaced. the beautifukl Chorus that the greatly underated Edge provides is astounding and his resonatiing guitar sound has returned. this album posses a harmony of the band that was lost in the 90's and it is good to see them be able to try somehting new and then come back to their roots. this is why they are the greatest band of all time-mattC"
5,No one compares to U2,I've been a fan of U2 for the past 16 years. U2 never ceases to suprise me with another great CD. The songs are just beautiful. I'm still listening to this CD everyday now for a year. You won't make a mistake buying this CD. No one compares to U2.
4,music to seek orgasms by,"this is the sort of intelluctually mature album put out by master rockers who know what they are up to. they have grown to a point where they can pretty much do what they like and get away with it, knowing that their massive fan base will still appreciate them. i certainly appreciate this album, it is cool calm and measured. i am a great fan of their more dance edged rock tracks off albums like Pop but this return to their roots is just as pleasing. its the sort of album to stick on while entertaining members of the opposite sex (or same sex ...) hence the title of the review :-)"
3,U2 Soldout!,"I truly think U2 sold out. I mean what ever happend to that little protest band from England, who rocked the hell out of Red Rocks??? I'll tell you, they turned into a pop band that charges 4 times as much for a concert ticket then they did 20 years ago, they turned into a band that charges $50 for a T-Shirt. They sold out people just face it, Bono thinks he is God, and The Edge is the most over rated guitar player ever! This is ok some of the songs are ok, but for the most part U2 played it safe with All That You Cant Leave Behind."
5,U2 is finally back on track...,"Wow!!!! This is an awesome U2 CD. I still say that The Joshua Tree is the best U2 album ever, but this is a close second or third. Beautiful Day is an awesome song, and so is Walk On and Stuck in a Moment... . This is definitely worth buying. A big improvement over Achtung Baby and Pop, which was a decline in U2's greatness. BUY THE ALBUM!!!! IT DIDN'T WIN THREE GRAMMY'S FOR NOTHING!!!!!"
3,AN AVERAGE COLLECTION OF MUSIC FROM AN AWESOME BAND,"U2 IS SURELY ONE OF THE FINEST ROCK'N'ROLL BAND OF THE WORLD. I LIKE THEIR MUSIC BECAUSE OF THEIR CATCHY TUNES AND INCREDIBLE STYLE OF MUSIC. BUT TO ME, U2 HAS DEPARTED FROM THEIR WORTH LISTENING STYLE OF MUSIC IN THIS ALBUM. THE PREVIOUS ALBUMS HAD A STRONG MAGNETIC INFLUENCE OF A CREATIVE U2 THOUGHT. ALBUMS LIKE JOSHUA TREE, WAR, ACHTUNG BABY, POP REFLECT THE TRUE IMAGE OF THE BAND'S SENSATIONAL CREATIVITY. ALTHOUGH THIS ALBUM INCLUDES SOME GOOD SONGS, BUT NOT MUCH IMPRESSIVE. LYRICS ARE ALSO WELL WRITTEN, BUT IN THE END THE DISAPPOINTED FACTOR IS THAT IT IS AN AVERAGE COLLECTION OF SONGS FROM AN AWESOME BAND."
1,Wow. God-awful. It's AMAZING they can sell and win so easily.,"I thought ""Beautiful Day"" was a good track, 'cause it's got some energy, but when you listen, his vocal is buried, because his range is GONE. Then, I thought ""When I Look At The World"" was gonna be OK, but his voice cracks, and he misses some notes. Last, on ""Grace"" he's flat. (They were the only mildly-promising songs!) Like other reviewers said--too much booze and cigarettes. But WHY and HOW does it SELL and WIN like it does? Unfathomable. Pet Shop Boys foreshadowed it YEARS ago on ""How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously,"" after parodying ""Where The Streets Have No Name:"" ""DO YOU THINK THEY'LL PUT YOU IN THE ROCK-N-ROLL HALL OF FAME?""!!!"
4,A continuing evolution,"An excellent return from U2, with Beautiful Day, a song that will go to the history of songs of U2. Although not the whole disk is full with hits, most of them are a treat to listen, knowing the restructrued style of U2. The Special part of this disk, what makes it a Limited Edition is the song ""Summer Rain"" that doesnt come with the Normal Edition, this song is a diferent kick from U2 but always with the same style, feeling and fidelity, that they have always had."
4,U2's flame is burning out......,"Joshua Tree is awesome, but Achtung Baby is U2's best album.I thought that All That You Can't Leave Behind was ok, but a lotof the songs sounded the same. When I Look at the World was the best song on this cd.However, U2 is getting old, and Bono is losing his voice. Idoubt this is there final cd, but I think there next will be there last,and best. Not even a band like U2 can stand up to plain old tiredness."
1,For die hard U2 fans only,"I have been on and off the U2 band wagon for about 10 years now. Achtung Baby was great, Zooropa not that good, and POP was OK. I really don't consider All That You Can't Leave Behind to be that much better then POP, Different yes, but better, no. Beautiful day is a tune that can be listened to time after time, but the others tunes are going to be forgotten within weeks. I was expecting more out of U2. Were is the inspirational rock tunes from Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby? Did they leave the Edge behind on this album? The one star I give is for Beautiful Day. My advice would be to simply buy the Beautiful Day single and leave this album for the die hard U2 fans, and only to keep your U2 collection complete."
1,Over hyped over rated garbage,"A masterpiece? What?! After Beautiful Day, this future coffee table coaster tumbles slowwwly to the end that almost never seems like it is coming. Retire already! Zack needs work. Fire Mr. Pretentious and replace him at once. And Beautiful Day seems so good because the rest is so bad. Stuck in A Moment of overproduced schmaltzy pop. Did Edge even show up for these sessions? If Adam Sandler went back to SNL, that unfunny skit would now be hilarious as Mr Cool is such a caricature now. Listen to me, I can still hit the falsetto! I found myself constantly hitting the skip button. All That You Can't Leave Behind? Well, they left behind talent, drive, passion, and integrity. Not that they were ever that great. The U2 myth continues to unravel. Come on JAY-Z, please outsell these has beens this week."
3,Disappointing,"I can't express how truly disappointed I am by this album. The preview tracks I had heard - Beautiful Day, Elevation, Walk On - were all solid, energetic well-written songs that seemed to indicate that U2 was tempering the sound they had been developing over the last three albums with a return to the simplicity of their earlier work. The album as a whole however, seems to dwell on the low-energy, ballady sound of Wild Horses. Not that most of the songs are bad (with the exception of Peace On Earth, which brings back the self-important message theme that U2 had seemed to have gotten over), but they're just dull. Lyrically Bono has rarely been more obvious, and while the music is beautiful, it is so subdued that you almost don't notice it. If you thought that Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop were high points for U2, then you should probably avoid this disc."
4,If at first you don't like it - listen again and again,"U2's return to huge sales rather than return to form as in my opinion they were never off form as in my mind Pop is their best album around.Anyway, All That You Can't Leave Behind didn't immediately capture my imagination as i had thought and Beautiful Day had. I just thought what's all the fuss about?Having not listened to it since the day of release i went back to it after hearing Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of on the radio and remembering every word. On returning to the album it sounding amazing - When I Look At The World, Walk On and Wild Honey were just brilliant and after 3 months i eventually realized this was a classic album but not their best.A must for every true U2 fan or Joshua Tree fan but anyone else i would say buy with caution."
3,I thought it was mostly bland,"I seem to be in the minority, as most people like this CD. And, I like some of it. Walk On and Elevation are my favorites. Everyone else seems to love Beautiful Day, but I don't much care for it, nor that much of the rest. This is my least favorite U2 CD, and I've got them all. This is mostly too mellow for my tast."
4,losing it,"U2 is definitely changing there style and I think I'm gonna' hate the it. I'm not saying this is a bad CD other than the fact that most of the tracks are heartless and shallow pop songs. Beautiful day is pretty good but unlike any of their previous songs you soon get tired of it. I think that Bono put the most heart into Little While and I'm not going to tell you why, listen and find out for yourself. Grace is kinda' like MLK in the sense that its got that lulaby thing going and its not so bad. overall its an ok CD but I would stick with the old stuff."
4,We asked for it.,"It's a very good cd. However, it's kind of hard to get tremendously excited about a release that cannot touch Achtung Baby. But really, can anything ever touch Achtung?Highlights on this cd include: ""Stuck in a Moment,"" ""Elevation,"" ""Walk On,"" ""Wild Honey,"" ""Peace on Earth.""U2 have given us what we've asked for since Achtung: A cd that we can feel confident rocommending to our friends."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I agree completely that this album is a masterpiece. It has some of the best songs that U2 have ever written. But I should give a warning to those of you who are still stuck in the Joshua Tree era. This album is NOT U2 getting ""back to their roots"" like a lot of people say. U2 have reinvented themselves yet again with this album and I commend them for it."
5,Best U2 in a long time,"U2 has made a fantastic record. The songs are interesting and full of wonderful melodies and sounds. Bono's voice is aging very gracefully. The overall sound is magnificent. This is a pop masterpiece. Definitely one for both the U2 fanatic, and those just interested in good pop/rock. Highlights for me are New York, Beautiful Day, and Wild Honey. Classic U2"
5,Great CD,"U2 has gone back to its ""Acthung Baby"" greatness by recording an album that does not disappoint. Every song is a stand alone achivement for the band. To mention a few of the many jewels of the album; I was blown away by the song ""Walk on"", an anthem whose lyrics give title to the album claiming that love is ""the only baggage you can bring"". ""Elevation"", with its guitar riffs, is a definite rocker displaying the band (and the Edge) at its best. ""Peace on Earth""'s lyrics are reminiscent of the ""Joshua tree"" soul-searching but in terms of sound is a well-crafted Christmas tune. In short, this is one of U2's masterpieces."
2,Overrated,"Man, what a disappointment. Maybe I listened too much to the hype. I'm a huge U2 fan; if music can change your life, then U2 has done that for me. So for all of you reading this who have scanned the other reviews and see the ""return to Classic U2"" kind of statements, they are being blinded by nostalgia for what this band used to mean to so many people. In the '80's/early '90's, U2 MEANT something in a way that other bands didn't. They seem like they are trying to reclaim a piece of that legacy on the new CD, but the songs just aren't that great. A couple of tracks are pretty good, and if you like U2 buy the CD anyway, but if you are buying into the ""return to the old U2"" hype YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. Lower your expectations and it's a decent CD."
2,You Sure Can Leave It Behind,"A bland and average set of innofensive rock songs, ""All That You Can`t Leave Behind"" has little to recommend. While there`s nothing truly horrible here, most of the moments are merely passable and far from memorable. ""New York"" is probably the best track, and even that is far from stunning. This record offers nothing new to the current music scenario, presenting weak compositions that lack originality and innovation. It certainly doesn`t deserve all the overexposure it got, since it has been awhile since U2 created something truly remarkable and cutting edge. This album may please die-hard fans of the band, but those who search for intriguing music will probably be disappointed.Passable and forgettable."
1,Essential Recording???!!!,"What the hell is this?. Essential for whom ?...for Rolling Stone, Billboard, Time, etc, etc the mainstream media whom were sent a lot of money because of their reviews. Everyone were fooled with this crap, and nobody seemed to notice.Where's art in this album?This is just a pathethic joke from their 80's stuff, trying to sound ""Classic"". Bono sings like s**t, easily his worst voice ever - listen to tracks 5, 6, 7 - songs are extremely ordinary, poor and flat, ballads are boring as hell, production is pointless, as well lyrics. This is just hype, style, sunglasses, Beautiful Day video, etc. A Shame.All That You Can't Leave Behind really sucks so bad, I'm ashamed to tell my friends. Bono said in a 1994 interview that the 3 piece sound was dead. This album sounds like a tired and dying rock band. much like Pink Floyds the final cut, Beatles let it be, Led Zeppelins in thru the out door, Kiss' the elder, etc.Absolutely rotten stuff.Listen to 90's U2, really"
2,Just Not Very Good,"I have most of the U2 albums and I didn't find this new one to be a thing of beauty, at all. I've listened to it 3 or 4 times in a row - in an effort to find redemption and I can't find it. Some of the tracks are good, but once again, I'm blown away at how a band can have so much talent and so much time off, and come away with nothing more than mediocrity.I, unlike others, would have liked to hear more of Edge on this one. But, capitalizing on that fateful Rolling Stones' verse, you can't always get what you want."
1,Very disappointing,"First of I am a huge U2 fan. I am amazed by their constant innovation and vision. I feel like this album is very poor(with eception of 2 tracks), none of the lyrics or music are impressive. It sounds like they just wanted to make an album for the fun of it. I bought the album without listening to it first and I paid the price. I cannot believe these are the same guys that made Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The best way to describe it is ""banal"". All my friends raved about this CD and for some reason I can't get into it. I want to just warn people to listen to it before they buy it. I am usually not so negative but this is honestly the worst they could have done short of recording themselves burping and then selling that as an album."
2,OK,"This CD is OK.I mean if you likerock and you are a U2 fan, then you'll probably like this cd,but 2 me its nthin special"
5,AnotherAwesome effort,"U2 is the greatest band on the planet and they prove it again with this classic album. SOme hits include ""STuck in a moment"", ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Elevation"". The band has there traditional type of music plus some pop added. People should buy this CD if they like good music."
4,Stunning,I bought this CD to complete my collection of all the new U2 CD's. U2 are such a stunning group and masterful writers of music.This CD is a must for all U2 fans. I have yet to hear anything U2 have done that I don't like.
5,U2's best album since Achtung Baby,"""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" is one of the best U2 albums of all time, and definitely their best since ""Achtung Baby."" The new record is very consistant...each track is part of a coherent whole, and there are no weak tracks. Of special note is the rocking opener ""Beautiful Day"" along with one of the best anti-war songs of all time ""Peace On Earth"" which is especially poignant right now when you listen to it in context of the situation in the Middle East. Along with these amazing tracks, ""New York"" is a great song about the real melting pot of New York City.This album is highly recommended for even casual U2 fans. 2000 is almost over, and U2 has released the best overall album by any rock artist in this year."
2,first impressions,"my rating is 2 1/2 stars. and that rating does not mean that this album is ultimately good or bad, just that it is my first impression of it. before listening to it i had heard this was a return to pre-techno era U2, however, i was disappointed by the lack of guitar on it. it seems the one thing they did leave behind was the Edge. U2 has mellowed after 20 years and this is where they are now. give it a listen if your in the mood to relax sometime."
4,"A Return to stripped down rock, but...","This album was hearalded as the end of U2's experiments gone wrong with electronica (i.e., Pop) and a return to simple stripped down rock. They succeed in this regard, but the album lacks the fire and ferosity of some of U2's earlier work like War or The Unforgettable Fire or the intraspection and connection with the American soul on The Joshua Tree. It's not U2's best, but still worth listening to."
4,Short and sweet,"Just like the music on the new U2 cd, that's how this review will be-short and oh so sweet. This is the best U2 album, next to the Joshua Tree. The songs are down to earth and melodic. The best song has to be In A Little While, which places you almost in the same room with U2, if they were performing live. This cd is a must have for everyone."
5,U2 proves that they can't leave it all behind..,"In the many incarnations of U2 in the '90s, many people were wondering where they were going with the electric synth pop sounds of Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop. With their latest album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 has returned to what made them the biggest band in the world. Four guys and their instruments. All of the songs on the new album show how much of a raw power U2 can create on a record. Songs like ""Peace on Earth"" and ""Walk On"" envoke the feeling of classic, sing a long songs like ""Pride"" and ""Bad"". This album brings U2 back to the spot that they belong in, the largest band in the world."
3,Lack of energy,"I started being a U2 fan since Achtung and ever since I've always bought their newest (and some of the older) CDs with optimism.Though I've liked no album as Achtung, sadly ATYCLB is the one I've liked the least. I'm giving it 3 stars because I only liked half of the songs. To me, this album lacks the energy and attitude of other albums, specially the second half (except for New York, which reminds me of better days). I also agree that Bono's voice keeps getting weaker after each album.As ever, I keep my fingers crossed expecting than How to Dismantle... does better."
1,A truly dissapointing album !,"WARNING: THIS ALBUM IS THE WORST U2 ALBUM EVERRRRRRRR!!!!!! AND I MEAN EVERRRRRR!!!! i mean what happened to that melodic and flawless tunes from the album ""Joshua Tree""? U2 became one of those alternative DJ rock band from a soft rock band. Dont waist ur money buying this album, buy Joshua Tree instead."
1,I truly hoped this would be as good as they say...,"But what a disapointment, even after several listenings nothing sticks. except maybe Wild Honey. Please don't compare this to the Joshua Tree or The Unforgetable Fire, even Zooropa and Achtung Baby were far more interesting(just remember Lemon for example). It's really a shame; I expected much more from Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, not to mention The Edge. I guess being commercially succesful, means being lame. An old fan - Disapointed"
1,What Happened??,"I've been looking forward to this new CD for quite some time. ""Back to their roots"" was a term used to describe this album years before it even came out. Many ""inside"" people said that it was going back to the style of 'The Joshua Tree'. I'm still waiting for that new album to be released then. While I'm not dissing this album, I found that it disappointed me. 'Achtung Baby' remains my favorite U2 album, and I tend to compare everything released since to that album. The direction this album took surprised me. It's a very mellow journey. If you like U2's changing style with each venture, then this album will satisfy you. But if you're expecting a 'Joshua Tree', or even a 'War'....all I can say is ""not here!"""
1,DISAPPOINTING,"The disturbing rants on this album don't pass as music in my book. Since Bono has been lobbying Congress to give our money away to Africa, his music has suffered. Maybe he should give his own money away first!"
2,U2's Worst Album,Since when this album became a masterpiece? There are few good songs but it's nowhere near The Joshua Tree and definitly a minus masterpiece!!
3,Hard to listen to,"I have barely listened to the tracks after 5 on this cd. Beautiful Day is a great song(why I bought the album). Elevation is okay. This cd has slow song after slow song after slow song. 2 is good but slow. At 4 the slowness starts and doesn't end until track 10, a great song called New York(I discovered on the radio, not the cd). It starts off slowly but builds. Unless you like a lot of ballads, don't buy this cd. The ballads are good, but not catchy enough to listen to 6 in a row. More like a 2 1/2."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...,"I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO LISTENING TO U2 LATEST CREATION AND THE CD LEFT ME WITH A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. I FOUND MYSELF PUTTING ON THE OLDER CDS TO MAKE UP FOR IT,ESP.ACHTUNG BABY WHICH IS BY FAR SUPERIOR. EVEN POP AND I HATE TO SAY ZOOROPA IS BETTER."
1,I was Very Dissapointed,"This was the worst U2 CD I have ever purchased. My Children hate it as much as I do. The worst song is beautiful day. They are a disgrace to Irish Heritage. In conclusion, this is the worst CD I ever bought and you should not buy it."
2,their worst yet,"And the hype machine is rolling folks. Its U2 yes, but its also recycled and boring. And Bono's lyrics! Oh man. Everyone says this is so good its classic and so on. Im sorry, I love U2 but i just don't see it. At all. Leave it behind like U2 left their creativity behind."
2,The jury is still out...,"When I purchased Pearl Jam's Binaural, I was vastly disappointed. But after about 5,000 listens, I made myself like it. I don't think I'll be able to do that with this album. I am so disappointed. U2 fans will know what I mean when I say this: the boys have finally ""gotten over it."" Gone are the days of angst, intimacy and heartbreak in U2 songs; here are the days of sappiness, shallow lyrics and complete normalcy. Normalcy. Blah. When did I ever ask for normalcy from U2? What happened to the textures and open-ended lyrics of Achtung Baby? What happened to the abstract poetics of the Joshua Tree? If I had wanted ""straight-up rock and roll"" from this band, I would have saved my money. Or bought a Hootie and the Blowfish album. Whichever. Can you tell I'm disgusted?!"
2,Disapointing follow up,"U2 are one of the many many bands that are know for there talent, but in this album it seems that they lost it, there songs aren't as strong and influentional as their old songs, when listing to some of the songs you skip many, only few songs are worth listing to . this is definnatly not a masterpiece like some of their old albums, it is a normal album, nothing great."
1,Wanna see how many push-ups I can do????,"I remember back in the day when I was rollin dice in the corners at the pubs at school. I used to listen to U2, but now it's a G thing. You don't believe me? Go ask the twins....."
5,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU U2!!!!!!!,"My husband and I are big fans of U2 going all the way back....and we couldnt wait to get our hands on this CD. Bono and the boys have now come full circle and have put together a collection that uses their original foundation - melodic compositions with the combination of edge's unique playing style. This CD is like comfort food - mashed potatoes and gravy - lets you sit back, say ""aaaaaaaah"" and feel really good about things and forget the rest of the world!!! Thank you U2 for giving us this gift!"
2,"Zzzzzzz...nothing noteworthy about this album,","Perhaps the truest test of any good band is their ability to acknowledge that the well has run dry. U2 is apparently either straining water from mud, or aimlessly wandering the field with a divining rod, because their well has definitely dried up. After successfully demonstrating that they had the ability to push their music in any direction they wished, they release this latest ""effort"", a collection of uninteresting drivel. The songs are shapeless, and not in a good way. It's like eating an entire box of wet saltines at one sitting...it's mushy, bland, and it makes you yearn for just about anything else.Their passion is obviously dead, possibly because they are too wealthy to care anymore. It's sad that it has happened, but the the unforgettable fire that used to be a part of every U2 song, is now completely extinguished."
5,Awesome entry into the 21st Century,"I must say that this is there most brilliant work since Achtung Baby. Every decade at least one album stands out like Joshua Tree of the '80's and Achtung Baby in the 90's. I am an avid, fanatical fan of theres and I find myself once again emerged into this album. There music has a way of piercing one's soul. Track's 1,3,4,5,8,and 9 are incredibly awesome. I can't wait for the tour!! If you are a true U2 fan and not stuck in the early 80's still (expand your horizon's old schoolers) you'll really enjoy this album. Bar none they are the greatest group in the world!"
5,U2 (Beautiful album),"This is the third U2 masterpiece. Along with Joshua and Achtung, U2 have done it once again. This album is rock and roll, not teenage pop where no one in the band can play an instrument. This is not computers playing and some guy singing along. This is four talented musicians doing what they do best. And it's not back to the basics, because the development of the lyrics and music, is so much more than Joshua. It is simply beautiful.As with each album, U2 keeps progressing, never the same thing twice, and no true fan would ever want it that way. It's what we love about them. It is what makes them a true band. Anyone interested in what rock and roll really is, rock with a spirit and a soul, rock that takes you on a journey, rock that takes you to a place you haven't been before, this album is a must have. A true rock fan's collection can not live without this album"
5,move over Joshua Tree...,This disc has arrived! I cant express what a terrific disc this is from beginning to end. How does U2 keep doing it after all these years. New bands need to take note from U2 and REM and make albums like this one.
2,The Gray Album,"Bono or one of the guys in U2 said this was their ""White album""--I think it's more like they gray album. Gray as in ho-hum. I've suffered through this album a half dozen times and I must say that this one will go down as my least listened to U2. This album is mediocre, dull, and uninspired. The Edge is wasted, Bono's weak voice isn't hidden behind the depth of music and/or passionate lyrics as in past albums, so it's just a bunch of screeches and groans. If the lyrics are classic, so is my used Bic razor. I was hungry for more U2, but now I feel like a ate at a bad Denny's knock off restaraunt. It's not Muzak, but it's not rock and roll either."
2,Completely underwhelming,"Love the band. Have all their records. Love the single ""Beautiful Day"". The rest...boring. I am shocked by the knee-jerk praise for this album, as if the critics and mass populace are determined to make sure U2 never takes a risk again. Clearly there is some sort of POP backlash going on here, because this album is so unnecessary to you record collection. Save your hard-earned dough and buy TRAVIS, ""The Man Who"", which is what the new U2 album could have been."
2,Very very bland album,"... I listened to (""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" in) a listening booth at virgin mega center, and I was really dissapointed, thank god for the listening booth....Otherwise I would have had to waste money on this record. I am, I used to be,( I cant even decide after hearing this record), a huge u2 fan, but this album is lame. After such post modern masterpieces like Achtung Baby and Pop they have reverted to adult contemporary. Boring, boring, boring. This album is such... schmaltz, completely lifeless, and totally uninteresting. U2 were always there to be refreshing, surprising us with something new, but this is not that record. Rock is truly dead!! This is a weak album, buy Kid A if you want something interesting."
1,don't believe the hype,"Listening to Beautiful Day makes you think All That You Can't Leave Behind is gonna be a great old-time U2 album. The fact is, there is almost no drum and bass section in this album. Stripped down is an understatement. U2 have never made an album like this, where there's only Bono to carry them. Normally, this would still be good, but Bono now thinks he is an R&B singer. His voice has been destroyed by cigarettes, age, and too much falsetto singing in the past. A once soaring set of pipes now sounds considerably limited to moaning. He sounds a bit better in concert, so let's hope he was just suffering from a bad couple of months when this album was recorded. Contrary to other reviews by people who either loyally refuse to see the truth or have just jumped on the band wagon, this album is not better than or as good as Joshua Tree or any other U2 album."
2,Forgettagble Fire,"I was surprised to see so many rave reviews of this album. While ""Beautiful Day"" is an incredible single, it's not enough to hold this album together. The remaining songs are too lyrically boring, sonically toned-down and musically bland to be memorable. Only the song ""New York"" near the end re-kindles the U2 fire they are known for. The contrast between this album and their last three is so great that it leaves me wondering about the future of this band...is this the beginning of the end? If you are a fan of the early REM albums (Murmer,Reckoning, Lifes Rich etc) as I am, this album is analagous to ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi""."
3,Unimportant. Unimpressive. U2,"This U2 CD is unimportant. I found it unimpressive and lacking in any special qualities. I rate it as the 9th best U2 CD available. It nowhere approaches the magnitude of the Joshua Tree.There was so much innovation (the infinite guitar, the arrangements, the melding of music and words) and such beautiful, sincere poetry in the Joshua Tree, that All That You Can't Leave Behind seems like a boring watercolor painting compared to a rich Van Gogh of the Joshua Tree.Bono is rather annoying in this work. But you can not blame him if he has nothing left to say. Maybe next time he can muster a passionate, spirited song called ""Viagra.""Still, it is a U2 CD and worth owning. It is not bad - just unimportant. The next tour will be worth catching, too."
1,Another victim of the Loudness wars.,"When I first heard this album on my car's MP3 player, I immediately fell in love with the album. However after listening to the entire CD on my high-end sound system, I feel much like Alex from ""A Clockwork Orange"" - revolted and nauseated with the music I love.This seems to be the first U2 album to be subject to the destroyer of sound fidelity: The loudness filter. Forget about appreciating the guitar work, drums and bass. All those sounds have been mushed together into a giant wall of static. This album is impossible to listen to from beginning to end without getting motion sickness.And record labels keep wondering why CD sales are plummeting. I would love to send this CD back asking for a refund due to lack-of-fidelity. Save your money and just download the MP3s."
2,Uninspired retro flash from U2,"Gone is the experimentation of the past three albums, which went a bit over the top, but at least this band never sounded like retreads of its old self on Zooropa, ...Baby or Pop. Here, the once socially relevant and powerful US bring back their old sound without the old feelings, and to me it sounds less than inspired. Clearly this is a monority opinion, judging from the other publised comments here, but this music sounds more like ""product"" than anything ever produced by this once revolutionary band. Lyrics as trite as those of ""New York"" would not have found their way onto a U2 album a decade ago, but now we hear Bono making tepid rhymes in a rock star pose that no longer looks unstudied. Bring back some of the heart to your music, boys, and all will be forgiven."
5,Healing,"It was said earlier but this CD has been playing all day for me, while I'm still mending my broken heart. It is eerily appropriate for today's situation and I urge those of you who don't have it and are struggling with the WTC attacks to buy it. It's filled with hope and inspiration, it really is."
4,The old U2 is back,"U2 has definitly grown up and passed their mid-life crisis. For those who loved the electro-pop of Zooropa or Pop, this might not be your thing, but for those who remember the golden days, this is a return. After a slight departure from the Daniel Lanois influenced albums for the late 80's/early 90's, U2 has gone back to their roots by reuniting with the Joshua Tree producers and it can clearly be heard. This much more relaxed album is a joy to listen to."
5,Soothing music,"I got this album and I have to say, when you don't feal like having your ears bashed in it's the best to listen to. Sometimes you just need some good ol' lyrics and smoothe tunes.This deserves 5+."
4,Mixed feelings,"This record overall is a fine peice of work. I would have liked some more classic U2 tracks such as Elevation, Wild Honey and Beautiful day but I think this record will be a grower. Not cut from the same cloth as Achtung Baby or Joshua Tree but nevertheless I prefer it to POP and Zooropa...a step back to roots and a step closer to the perfect U2 record."
4,Good but not great.,"About half the songs are great. You can feel the magic of The Edge in some of them like Beautiful Day, Walk On, When I look at the world and New York. Bono is super as usual. The music in the remaining songs is alright but not great. Of course, Brian Eno's contribution makes it better.I would rate this after Achtung Baby, Rattle and Hum and Joshua Tree. But if you are a fan, you cannot ignore this one. Get this one, just to let The Edge take you there, if for no other reason.A couple of songs sound like tunes from Urban Hymns by The Verve. Thats my only complain."
1,I hate this album!,This album is the worst material I have heard in about 10 years. Beautiful Day is the worst song I've Heard in my life. It uses the same background music their old songs used. The rest of the album is filler. It should have never been nominated for a grammy! Check out better music such as Rick Astley or Paula Abdul! Stay way clear of this garbage!
1,Long Time Fan First Disappointment,"I've have been with U2 from the start; but I won't give you my resume. This is the only time I have been disappointed with a U2 release. The songs seem to focus on Bono's vocals as opposed to the music which is not what made U2 who they are. Bono is not a great vocalist, I would say borderline good, but he is a great singer if you can follow. He puts his heart and soul into every word which is usually felt in the emotion of the songs; not on this album. The rock of U2 has always been the music, Edge's unequaled rifs,larrys unique timing and Bonos emtion are what make the band great; it is not on this album."
1,how to become fossils,"... by recording such hypocritical, capitalist, disposable, absolutely empty, easy, commercial, sobreexposed, liar and temporary crap. This is just poor dull stuff from a former great band.For the first time The band sounded tired, old, uncreative, lazy, the tunes have run out, the zest is gone. Even the packaging looked bland.LISTEN TO POP INSTEAND, AND AVOID THIS SOUNDTRACK FOR SISSIES"
1,LEAVE THIS ONE BEHIND..........,"i personally liked the direction U2 was going with their past 3 albums (pop, zooropa, and achtung baby). don't get me wrong, i enjoy a little ""joshua tree"" every now and then. But i like it better when a band who has been around for while, like U2, changes with the times, or better yet, when such a band ""pushes the envelope."" Most U2 fans were waiting for this type of return to their ""roots,"" i guess, but i was truly disappointed in this flat-out BORING album. the only songs that grab me are ""elevation"", ""new york"", and ""grace""... but that's only because they sound like they belong on their previous 3 albums! the rest of the album sounds like all one song, with different titles. ""wild honey"" & ""stuck in a moment"" are especially ""non-U2"" sounding songs. so, in short, i would say, you CAN leave behind ""all you can't leave behind."""
1,old boring irish men.,"i used to really really like u2, back when their lyrics were poetic. ""Joshua Tree"" makes it official - u2 is a one album wonder, the rest is crap. how can anyone find deepness in their lyrics now? ex: ""you just can't get enough of that lovey dovey stuff"" - lyrics from their ""POP"" album. or even worse than that those nonsense lyrics of ""wild honey"" - even the title of the song is pathetic. if you are looking for a rock band that will mesmerize you, listen to Radiohead, or Coldplay. put u2 back on the shelf- they have enough money anyways."
2,LEave it behind.,"Bono's voice is SHOT in this album. Honestly, he had laryngitis when he recorded this album. Half of these songs you can hear his voice cracking, on the other half his mic feed is turned to the ""infinity plus"" setting so it's Rapmaster P Bono whispering to the music!"
2,"Unpleasant, dense, uninspired","A real disappointment from a once great band. They really having been slipping further down with each release since ""The Joshua Tree"".It would be nice if they would get it together long enough to make a good album."
1,I've never been bored by a U2 album... until now,"I've been a loyal U2 fan for as long as I can remember. I hate to admitt it but I think the band is going the way of the Rolling Stones. Sure ""Beautiful Day"" is a good song, and maby there are one or two other songs on the album worth listening to (New York for example), but the album as a whole lacks energy. I've listened to it almost nonstop for a week now and I still can't remember what half the songs sound like. The best songs on this album would just sound like filler on any other U2 release. I would never accuse of just fakeing it, but it really sounds like they've lost their edge. Let's hope the next release proves me wrong."
3,You Can Leave This Album Behind...,"This is U2's best album since Achtung Baby, which isn't saying a whole lot, unfortunately. In between, they've released poor albums such as ""Zooropa"" & the commercially over-hyped ""Pop"". A lot has been said of this album, such as this being as good or even better than ""The Joshua Tree"" and that they've returned to their old form... all this is UNTRUE! Unfortunately, it sounds as if they're still experimenting, and still sound a bit pop. I was a bit disappointed by this album, but then again, this is an improvement from ""Zooropa"" & ""Pop""... so it's a step in the right direction.I don't think that there is a great song destined to be a U2 classic on this album, but does feature a few pretty good songs, such as: ""Wild Honey"", ""New York"", ""Beautiful Day"", ""Elevation"", ""Walk On"", & ""Stuck In A Moment.."".Overall, it should satisfy the real U2 fans, but probably won't live up to their expectations. NOT really recommended to the casual U2 fan."
5,What more do you want?,"I'd like to start off this review by reminding people that U2 is made up of a bunch of HUMAN BEINGS. Like the rest of us they change with the times. Imagine yourself being a computer technician in oh let's say 1987 and not changing with the times and technology. Is that what we expect U2 to do? Do we expect them to live in the year 1987 for the rest of their lives? I think U2 is financially secure enough to be making albums for themselves these days. I think they deserve it, they don't owe me anything. They've worked hard all these years to get to where they are. I don't think they were trying to please anybody but themselves with this album, which in my opinion makes it all the more heartfelt and important. This is the music U2 wants to make and I for one happen to like it."
2,Comeback? Hardly....,"Why do people consider this a comeback? ...because after the experimentation (and overall more interesting material) of POP, this is WAY more commercial? Must be. I can't think of another reason. This is the sound of a one defiant and confident band pandering to the masses. I wouldn't say the horrible ""s"" word, but most of this is painfully generic....and what happened to the once brilliant lyrics? That is the biggest crime here. Only a couple of these songs are respectable lyrically...the rest of the band carries what little material works on this set.""Kite"", ""Peace On Earth"", ""Walk On"" and ""Beautiful Day"" are the strongest because Bono actually made an effort on those....Imagine programming a cd to play only 4 songs on a U2 disc?!?!?Wild Honey is so bad, it actually makes me angry....Overall, a HUGE disappointment."
2,The first U2 album I've rejected,"Let me qualify myself briefly be saying I am a huge fan who at one point owned everything they recorded in the studio (save a few B-sides) on vinyl beginning with their Irish only debut EP U2-3. I first got turned on to them after they released The Unforgetable Fire - still their best in my opinion. Certainly more mature sounding than the current stuff they've done. ""All that you . . ."" is stripped down, but to the point of wimpiness. More importantly, these songs are not apealling or catchy. I actually sold my CD because I knew I'd never listen to it. Yes, my viewpoint is very much in the minority."
5,Another U2 Classic,"U2's sound is constantly evolving and this album is their latest awesome piece of work. It's not ""Joshua Tree"" which is my favorite album of all time, but it is a classic none the less. It has the ringing/echoing guitar work that Edge is famous for and the great harmonies you love to hear from U2. This album is great!"
2,Nooooooooooooooooooo!,"Don't buy this cd, it's by far their worst yet. Commercial cr*p if you ask me. Sadly U2 seem to have lost touch with their roots and can't relate to us ""common"" people anymore *sob*. Cheerfull and commercial it's a far, far cry from their glory days :("
5,another great record from U2,"I personally am a fan of electronic music, so my favorite U2 albums are pop and zooropa, their experimental peaks. but this album is great, it goes back to the music that made them popular. it sounds more similar to the joshua tree than anything. i think they felt it was time to return to their roots and thats exactly what they did. its a great collection of songs, its a good album to listen to in the car all the way through. they were phenomenal in concert a couple of weeks ago. their performance of walk on was nothing short of breathtaking, and should become a huge hit for them. elevation is a great song too and sounds even better live. there are many other great stand out tracks like wild honey, in a little while, etc. but there are some ""fillers"" i think like peace on earth, or stuck in a moment you cant get out of. if your a die hard fan or just a casual fan, even not a fan at all, i still would reccomend you checking this album out. its overall a very solid album."
3,Good but not Great,"When ATYCLB came out, I was thrilled that U2 was returning to their roots, with an album that contained echoes of the styles they explored from ""War"" through ""Achtung Baby."" However, under a lot of repeated listenings, the CD hasn't held up as well as any of their earlier albums: some primordial spark seems to be missing. The fact that ""Beautiful Day"" won three grammys points more to flaws in the grammy nomination system than to merits of the song itself: as Bono said, ""it's got no bridge, it's got no real chorus.""Even though ""Peace on Earth"" and ""When I Look at the World"" have the same kind of poignancy found on earlier albums, there isn't a single song in this collection that comes close to the power of ""New Year's Day,"" ""One,"" ""Pride,"" ""With or Without You,"" or even the best songs off of ""Pop"". I don't know if this is a failure of nerve, judgment, or philosophy, but the guys just sound kind of tired. Hoping for a bullseye next time around, but then I always do with U2."
1,Pop at its modern best,"I wish more pop albums would be like this. Varied, heart-felt, and U2 bring their experience to the scene. My first impression was that it doesn't really compare to their classic albums (Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby) but it was one of the best albums of the year 2000.I've never really believed that U2 are amazing lyricists but I've believed that Bono is a very good singer and Edge is a very good guitarist. The ideas behind All That You Can't Leave Behind are the usual peace, love and melancholy entrapment. If you're feeling disappointed by the current state of music, pop and otherwise, this album may brighten you up for a short time. ..."
3,STUCK IN A MOMENT I WISH I COULD GET OUT OF,"Some songs on this album are exceptional to say the least. However, ""Wild Honey"", ""In a Little While"", should have been kept under the B-side blanket and discovered in the year 2020 with the Best of U2 2000-2010. It seems like Bono is scraping from the bottom of the barrel for lyrics, ""Irish have been coming here for years, feel like they own the place."" The album is not the best in comparison to ""Unforgettable Fire"", but it does have some good moments. Stuck in a Moment and Walk On are good tunes that leave their mark. At least they do for me. Go ahead and buy the album. Just think that our money, Not Bono's money will be used to save Africa."
5,U2 does it again!,"Once again, U2 has made a cd that blows the rest away! Clearly this is the best cd of the year and I would recommend it to anyone who loves real music. U2's music (and in particular, this album) shows incredible talent as well as honesty and maturity. You can tell that Edge, Adam, Bono, and Larry have been playing together for over 20 years... ATYCLB is just the best...... as are all of U2's albums. Buy ATYCLB and you will want to buy them all!"
4,"I actually liked ""Beautiful Day.""","I got word just now that U2 won Grammys for this album, I saw them last night on the show, along with Christina Aguilera and Shakira, whose ""MTV Unplugged"" won Best Latin Pop Album of the Year. I don't have this CD, but I downloaded ""Beautiful Day"" just now, heard it again, and actually had more appreciation for it than I had before. Forget what I said in my ""going commercial"" review; these Irish lads most justly deserved the victory they achieved last night. Sorry, 'N Sync. :)"
3,same old Eno,"I like Brian Eno, but 4 albums now with U2? 2 tracks stand out-""In a Little While"" is an exceptional soul song, and ""Grace"" is nice, although you can tell its Daniel Lanois leftovers from ""Sling Blade"". One track is I think the worst track the band has done, called ""Stuck in a Moment""; kind of a ""laa-dee-da"" song. I'm still waiting for T-Bone Burnett to produce."
3,"Bonos voice, Wheres edge's guitar?","Overall this cd rates three stars with me. It doesn't touch Achuting baby, rattle and hum, or the joshua tree. First off Bono's voice has deterroated over the years, as age creeps up on him. There is not enough Edge on this record, which results in this disc looking like a solo recording for Bono. I was never struck on Beautiful Day since the time it was released, but it is a fairly strong song and single. Track 2, stuck in a moment, is a great ballad utilizing all of U2 including Bonos voice and the Edges guitar. The rest of the songs are all good except for tracks 8,10, and 11 which are utterly crap. Wild honey is an acoustic piece with a very catchy chorus. Well all U2 fans are going to buy this one anyway, but it probably will not attract many new fans."
4,"""Hi Rez"" Vocals","This new CD is really growing on me. I have been a U2 fan ever since they played at Philly's ""Hot Club"" In 1980. Their music has grown and matured with them (and me) release after release. I will be the first to say that ""Zooropa"" and ""Pop"" were not up to their standards, although there are a few great cuts on both.This new CD is excellent from start to finish. I am very pleased with the quality of the recording. U2 has had a problem in the past with ""bass control"". Not this time (Thanks Mr. Lanois). Bono puts his voice on the line in this one. He is closely mic'd on nearly every track, using very little in the way of effects. This ""Hi Rez"" sound highlights Bono's naturally dramatic voice. I really like the effect (or lack of effects). Oh! the songs are good too! : )"
3,Solid.......a few good songs that rock like classic U2.,"The first 4 songs are good. ""Beautiful Day"" will be a huge hit in the US. ""Elevation"" will also do quite well. I enjoy U2, but I think their best days of music writing might be gone, sorry everybody."
1,"Ego is what you can't leave behind, Bono","Although I think the singles are very good, I had to give this album 1 star on principles alone. For that I apologise.In the early nineties, Bono accepted an MTV award for best alternative band with a speech ending ""...an we will continue to f...-up the mainstream"". Well, it seems that quite the opposite has occurred. The band is getting critical praise for retreading old areas and avenues!!! The album is safe and commercial and will no doubt serve Bono's ego fix after the unpopular PopMart tour. Shame for giving in to market forces.It would be nice of them to retire now, at their peak, but I know this won't happen. We'll just have to watch a slow and painful death of a band over the next 5 to 10 years.Boo!"
1,That's enough,"That's enough now. Despite the fact that U2 fans keep convincing themselves that their favourite band is still the best in the world no matter what, it should be pretty clear to everybody that U2 have reached their peak (and what a peak, I used to love them too) a long time ago, but now, rather than having the dignity of ending their career at their best like every great band should do and usually does, they sadly keep releasing cds after cds, from Best ofs and Lives to new albums where the attempt to adapt their sound to a new era and different tastes, with unconvincing electronic sounds and dull songs is, yes, to be appreciated, but simply not enough. They are simply not as good as they used to be, and the longer they wait to call it quits the worse it's gonna get. Isn't it better to disappear from the scene leaving beautiful songs and unforgettable memories in our minds, rather than descending the mountain of glory they conquered long ago..."
2,Some Songs I *Can* Leave Behind,"I had great hopes for this album. I really did. On a recent visit to London, I caught U2's performance of ""Elevation"" on ""Top of the Pops."" I remember thinking, ""Good! They're getting back to making strong, interesting music. It's about time."" Following the insipid sorts of things that U2 has put out since the early '90's, I was ready for a real change of pace. Imagine my disappointment upon discovering that ""Elevation"" was the only departure from that sadly-established pattern. I am unable to explain why ""Beautiful Day"" is so popular ... repetitious, dull lyrics and a not-too-interesting rhythm. The rest of the cuts are so forgettable that they are not even worth mentioning. For the most die-hard U2 fans only."
5,Essential U2,"In an age of angry-suburban-youth and suger-sweet bubblegum music, ATYCLB is a subtle masterpiece. The songs are all inviting, easy on the ears, but layered in a way that reveals itself more passionate and mature with each listen. I have the limited edition with the additional single 'Always'. It's a great song too...actually suprised it was left off the album. Word is U2 wrote lots of music for this album, so I wouldn't be suprised by a post-tour follow-up release, ala 'Rattle and Hum', if ATYCLB is a success. Definate A+!"
5,U2 - Back to the Basics,"U2 went back to the basics for this masterpiece (ATYCLB). It's not War, It's not POP, but, it may be somewhere in between. It is a couple of things..refreshing and uplifting. All tracks are good, but, the best are Beautiful Day, Kite, Elevation, New York and When I look at the World. The lyrics are outstanding as usual and the above mentioned 5 songs make you want to get up and air guitar, bass or drum (pick one) all over the living room while singing your lungs out (see song lyrics first). U2 is defintily ""selling"" this one better to the public and I bought it hook, line and sinker. Hopefully, more good stuff to come from these guys."
4,A Worthy Effort,"Having been a u2 fan for the better part of 15 years and eagerly awaiting the release of (atyclb) I feel this is a worthy effort from a great band. Beautiful day, Walk On, Peace on Earth, Grace are all u2. Great production cover up some of the flaws in bonos now aging but still great voice. I think this is the perfect sound for u2 at this juncture in their great career's."
3,Correction,"Just to correct Thomas Walsh from Ireland - U2 HAVE been around for a while - I first heard them in 1982. I believe their album ""October"" came out in 1981. I think being a band for almost 20 years can be considered a special feat."
5,Great album,This album is a welcome change to the sound of U2. It is very intimate and with this album you feel as if it is just the four band members in a room being great musicians. All of the songs are beautiful and have great emotion. When you listen to this album you feel as if everything is right in music once again.
2,yeah right!,"I allready knew some songs of U2 on the radio and I liked them. I allready had buyed a greatest hits cd of U2 which was nice(4 stars). But this cd is nothing. I am sorry for myself because I spend money on this. The songs that I heard on the radio were good, I allready knew them so that was not a surprise, but the rest just sucks. Below you can see how I rate the songs:Beautiful Day: 9/10Stuck In A Moment: 8/10Elevation: 8/10Walk On: 9/10Kite: 7/10In A Little While: 7/10The first 6 songs are very good, but the rest just sucks!Wild Honey: 1/10Peace On Earth: 4/10When I Look At The World: 2/10New York: 2/10Grace: 1/10The 2 stars I give to this cd are the stars for the first 6 songs, if the rest of the album was as good as the first 6, then I might have given this album 4 or 5 stars, but no. So only buy this if you are a real U2 fan, if you are new with U2 then you should buy a greatest hits album."
2,OK but...,"I just don't get it. Yes, they are interesting and Bono has a soaring voice but other than a couple of catchy tunes, the rest is nondescript and bland. While they are apparently trying to diversify their sound, the limitations in their song writing ability is becoming ever more evident. I guess to many this band is the second coming, however there is so much more interesting, challenging and dynamic music out there. Try the new Porcupine Tree album,""In Abstenia"" if you want music that drives you. It's time to move on."
2,Average at best...,"This album disappoints. It's clear that opinions on this album are widespread, so you should make your own assessment (buy the disc - it's U2, after all) but my take is that it:1) lacks passion 2) lacks originality and artistic appeal 3) seriously lacks Edge's guitar 4) lacks a ""theme"" - which is what makes listening to other U2 albums such a joyU2 newcomers may like this album - it's pretty easy to swallow - but a true fan may have a tougher time having revelled in Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree, The Unforgettable Fire and others all these years.U2 set their own bar really high - they're having a tough time clearing it now because of it."
1,Yawn too,U2 did indeed roar out of the blocks with albums like Boy and October. I miss the energy of songs like I Threw a Brick and the subtleness of the title track to October. It's a long way from their youthful angst and inspiration. This album forged no new ground to my ears. I so prefer lesser known groups like Isotope 217 who deserve even half the attention given to these dinosaurs.
4,Probably the best album of 2000,"When I heard that U2 was coming out with a new album, I immediately asked my parents for it for Christmas. However, when I first put it on to listen to it, I was all like ""What the heck is this...?"" and thought it was completely bland and uninteresting except for ""Walk On"". But then, after a couple of deeper listenings, my opinion completely changed. This album has really grown on me and I listen to it almost every day now. It is beautiful, uplifting, well put-together and also very spiritual. My favourite tracks are ""Walk On"", ""When I look at the world"", ""Grace"", and the Beatles-ish ""Wild Honey"". Even if you are not a U2 fan, buy this album anyway, you won't regret it."
5,"Ya, now ESPN kicks!","Ya, not only did ESPN play ""Walk On"", they were playing ""Elevation"" during those clips they show of great moments in NFL and stuff. Ya, this album is a great album, and you need to buy one, or two if one doesn't satisfy you. I see alot of these songs turning up on sound tracks to movies in the near future. They will make awesome soundtracks at that."
2,Booorring!,"I bought this as a gift for my favorite U2 fan. Every song sounds the same as the one before. People told me it sounds more like ""old U2"". Yeah. It sounds suspiciously like a band trying to sound like U2 yet still be palatable to the radio audience. It's by far their least innovative and most sappy... but I know what the problem is. Radiohead made a Faustian deal and stole all of U2's future albums. They sound more like U2 than U2 does now. I'm very disappointed."
3,mediocre at best,"U2's latest is the perfect example of an album that doesn't live up to the hype. The band claimed it was a return to its roots. What we got instead was basically Achtung Baby Part Two, only none of the songs are as good. The first single, ""Beautiful Day"" is fairly decent, but the disc quickly descends into mediocrity after that and stays there until the end of the disc. ""Wild Honey"" is OK, but like too much of the disc, it sounds too much like the band's earlier material. Has the band lost its edge (pun intended)? It certainly sounds that way. Maybe they're just getting old. Don't get me wrong, the CD isn't bad. It's better than their last two albums. However, there's nothing that grabs your attention either. My personal recommendation? Skip this one, and listen to Achtung Baby instead. It's the same thing, only a whole lot better."
2,Get Over Yourself Already !!,"I have tried to like U2 but after repeated listens and taking the time to digest this left over 80's band filled up with its own significance , I can no longer stand it . I lump them in with the Beatles, Stones and Springsteen as the most overrated artist of all time . It would take their whole catalog for me to fill 1 cd ...sorry folks but they are just a mass commercial outfit with one of most repetitive guitar sounds ever ."
4,"Not their best album, but still an outstanding album!","In my opinion, this album falls behind the Joshua Tree album, but none the less, an excellent album by U2.There are many theological strings that run through this album with the most obvious being grace.As an interesting side note, the album cover is set in Charles de Gaulle airport, however there is no Gate J33-3. This was a purposeful change to the photograph and is a reference to Jeremiah 33:3!"
5,NEY SAYERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING--U2 ON A MISSION,"I can't believe what I am reading from these reviews, U2 fans not liking this album. You need to be hit in the head, this is U2's fourth masterpiece. List album has to be listened to over and over again to appreciate its layering of emotion and plight of the human soul.I have been a fan since '88 and have always been partial to War, Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, but All That You Can't Leave Behind sounds like four Irish friends rediscovering their roots. The album is simple and not extremely overproduced with a natural raw sound that reflects four guys playing in a band. You can't get any better than this and when albums are review in the future, this one will come out on top."
2,"Let's get it together, guys","This album sure is a dud. Save for the dark ""New York"" tune, ATYCLB just doesn't cut the grade - it's pretty [bad]. U2 are known for their cutting edge style and their ability to always push musical boundaries, but this record doesn't push much of anything - except U2's unit shifting status in the biz.Sure it's a big seller, but that doesn't make it a unique or enjoyable album! I just hope we're not in for a decade of grandfather rock by one of the best bands ever.Let's get it together, guys....."
1,Disappointed fan,"It's not just this cd that lets me down, but everything U2 are doing at the moment. Rather than leaving us their great albums and quitting as legends, they produce insignificant music that will slowly (but painfully) make them die. What a let down...."
3,what happened to U2's Pride?,"It's sad what people will do to stay in the limelight. Sure, U2 has always had one foot in the pop mainstream, but with this album they seem to have taken the plunge. It's not an entirely AWFUL album, but it's definitely not their best work. This album will probably disappoint most hard-core U2 fans."
5,A Brilliant Piece of work!,"When I listened to ""Beautiful Day"", I thought, what'll they think of next? When I saw Elevation, Stuck In A Moment, and Walk On get in, the album was a must-have! It still is today!Enjoy the album because it is brilliant!"
2,completely overrated !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this record had been highly successful and has sold over 13 million copies worldwide, and it sold 4,2 million copies in the us alone and has become a critics favourite.there are a lot of people who claim that it belongs to the 3 best u2 albums ever alongside THE JOSHUA TREE and ACHTUNG BABYbut im completely disappointed. I bought the cd and thought that all songs may be like the Radio Hit BEAUTIFUL DAY; but this was a big mistakeonly ELEVATION and WALK ON are songs which are ok, but nothing specialthis is one of those records of which you will remember only 1-2 songsi ask myself why it had been more successful than HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB(2004) which had at least 5 good songs"
2,Nothing spectacular....,"When I read the back of this book, I thought it sounded really good and couldn't wait to read it. Alas, the author couldn't quite make the story come to life for me. The hero and heroine was one dimensional and had boring personalities, (more so the heroine than the hero.) I love to read romance in which you can see the reason why the hero and heroine fell in love with each other, but I seriously wondered what Brahm saw in Eleanor. She was such a push over and there was nothing extraordinary about her. It seems that authors believe that if the heroine acts like a mother to all her siblings and does charity work for the poor, it automatically makes her irresistible. I want to read about a heroine that has a real life personaliy with flaws and all, but there was no such heroine in this book. The heroine's jealous sister is the one that kept the book somewhat entertaining, but I lost interest quickly since I didn't really care for the hero or heroine."
2,Didn't care too much for this one,I won't rehash the plot as the other reviewers did an excellent job on that count. I will say that just because he was drunk doesn't excuse his actions! Yet he makes it sound like they should be excused just because he was drunk. At one point he even says that a drunk really can't perform. Um . . . didn't seem to have a problem with Lydia though did he?
2,Overwound heroine,"I was eager to read this story, simply from the premise.Too bad it did not fulfull it's promise.Brahm Ryland, Lord Creed is taking his chance to win back the woman he loves, Eleanor Durbane. Years ago, their love was smashed by his drunken betrayal of her with her own sister, Lydia.It all flows quite well, Brahm arrives, is thoroughly castigated by Eleanor, her sisters etc. He takes it on the chin, he trys to win her trust, tells her his side of the sorry tale. Eventually she seems to forgive...Seems, alas. Because Eleanor then proceeds to torture both us and Brahm by changing her mind so often and confusingly, that she is like the old Jimmy Durante song and doesn't know whether she's coming or going.Ruined the book and sank it to the level of over emotive, turgid melodrama. It had me muttering to Brahm that he was well rid of her and to escape her clutches while he had the chance."
5,Great Toy!!!,I purchased this for my nephews 3rd birthday. He loves playing with ours whenever he comes over so I knew it would be a hit. It's a great source of entertainment for both girls and boys of all ages! The quick clean-up and storage are great too!
5,You'll Be the HIT of the neighborhood!!!,"This is an excellent toy the kids will spend hours playing with! Finally a sturdy toy that compacts well and where kids use actual energy to play with. No need to sit in front of the TV.. let the kids go outside and play. I bought 2 of these, one for our summer house location. Don't forget to buy extra rockets, because some get lost-and don't be fooled into buying a cheaper version-I did at first and they just break. Hope this review convinces you!"
3,OK,A little flimsy for older kids. It does fly reasonably high but the rockets should be made of foam & larger like some other manufactures we have used. There should be a way to order additional rockets for when they get stuck in trees or lost.
1,Great Idea..Poor quality,only one rocket works. One rocket has a stamped hole in the foam top so goes no where. the other defected rocket goes up 15 feet and don't know why. And number three is awesome it shoots up about 125 feet.
5,Great fun!,"My 4 year old and his friends played with this at a birthday party recently and had a blast with it. He really wanted one, so I looked online and found it quickly at Amazon. The reviews said it was durable (a very important characteristic for any children's toy), and it definitely has been! My son and his 2 year old brother play with it all the time, seeing how high they can launch the rockets (and how high they can get it stuck in the trees!)."
3,"Nice launcher, cheap rockets","I ordered one of these for my nephew a few weeks ago. I was very impressed with the quality of the launch dock. However, we blew the rubber tips out of two of the three included rockets within 15 minutes of use. The plastic wall thickness on the rockets is unacceptable, and the rubber tip on each rocket serves as the ""air seal"" for the rocket. In all fairness though, my nephews made me stomp the pad, and the rockets are not made for that much air pressure. The manufacturer should really consider beefing up the quality of the rockets though. This would be a great toy if some imprevements were made."
5,Better than older style,The kids really enjoy this newer version of the stomp rocket. The rockets go higher and it comes in a sefl-contained carry case which keeps the rockets and launch pad together. Product arrived on time. No cons as of yet. Had the product for several months now. Gets used weekly.
5,The best of the pumper rockets,"I bought 3 of these type rockets for my child's 4th birthday party, and this one is by far the most durable and easiest to use. My kid is small but was still able to easily make the rocket shoot into the air. The housing is made of durable hard plastic rather than foam rubber which is easily smashed. Of the three we bought, this was the only one left intact after 30 children swarmed all over them."
5,Get extra rockets,"This is a go-to toy in our house (and a great gift) and we typically go through 1 every Spring/Summer because it gets so much play. I usually have to replace it because of ""odd"" events and not a result of the toys durability. We left it outside one night and a critter chewed through the foot pad, another one got so much play that we blew a crack in the tubing. But this shouldn't deter you from purchase as Marky Sparky does have excellent customer service when it comes to replacements. Be sure to get extra rockets - it only comes with three and it good to have the extras. I think I have about 6 on my roof somewhere!"
3,Good value for your money.,"stuhrling original sport watch. Good value for your money. However, it is big and rather limited in its features. For instance, no glow-in-the dark hands, no day of the week etc."
2,its a watch,"The screws on the bezel are very very shinny and look odd with the flat blackMore ""bling"" than I expected. Big Date feature is nice."
1,Well ...,"I really liked these ... until they broke, which was about 30 days after I purchased them. By ""broke"" I mean that the sound cuts out and I have to jiggle (hold) the wire to get any sound. So ... I can't recommend these earphones."
3,"interesting concept, skillful interpretation, but sounds very dated now","As a performance, the music here is fantastic, and considering the challenges of monophonic sythesizers it is very impressively and skillfully performed. That said, if like me you were born after electronic music became commonplace, this will sound incredibly dated. The problem is that the sound programming abilities of the first moogs were limited, so the sounds are not very fitting to the music, creating a slightly comical kitschy mock-futuristic effect. Part of this effect is the womp womp womp beep beep beep sounds that now sound corny. While interesting, it sounds very anachronistic and less evocative than real instruments. I think I'll go back to orchestral performances of classical music. I'll keep this in case I ever want to make a campy future film spoof. Wow, I sure said ""sound "" a lot. Well, this really is all about the sounds."
4,Under the Hill Right Now...,"I would just say, of Wendy Carlos' new record album, ""Well Tempered Synthesizer,"" that it is the most wonderful of all recordings that have ever inferred synthesized, phonyness of a degree that even Charles could not conflagrate in his holocaust of soundmaking. Bottoms up to Wendy Carlos."
3,NEW KNIGHT RIDER,It's okay. . .Alittle different than the old series; the mustang is a pretty cool change; watched a few episodes; not to disapointed yet; going to go ahead and finish the season
1,Knight Rider,NEVER RECEVIED THIS DVD THESE GUYS ARE A RIP OFF. THEY MUST HAVE SENT ON A SHIP IT'S THE 27TH MAYBE I GET IT NEXT CHRISTMAS. I WILL NOT DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN!
2,Don't bother...,"I don't meant to rain on anyone's parade, but the only reason to watch this show is for the bit of skin they show each episode. I enjoyed the pilot movie, but, unfortunately, they brought on a slightly different group of people to do the actual show, and, well, KITT becomes a transformer. We're not talking about the already absurd super pursuit mode from the original series here--he TRANSFORMS into a TRUCK. That, and the fact that the writers basically discarded the point of the original series (""One man can make a difference"") by having about 3x the supporting cast that is necessary, really ruined the show for me. After the mid-season reboot, the show did improve a bit, and I had hopes for a much-superior season 2, but it was too little too late.Save your money. Don't bother with this show; just re-watch the originals."
1,Wrong coding,Make sure u get set from the U.S. or they won't play at all. My'n came from the U.K. and they say coding wrong for player and eject.
3,knight rider,i got this product for someone else he liked it very much and i would also purchase it for myself in the future thank you very much
4,Good 80's Tv Classic Show,"Michael Long was a Police Lt workin undercover on a case in Las Vegas.During it's duty it's shoot on her face by a ruthless woman and left dead on his car.A dying millonaire ,Wilton Knight takes him to his lair and gives him a new face and identity Michael Knight.He also provides him with a new intelligent armoured Black Trans-Am with a cool new dash and capable of talkin,do jumps in the air and cruises at top speed of 300 mph to get the criminals who operate above the law as the intro speech says.The show lasted for 4 seasons.Between where the cool Airwolf and the short Street Hawk which only lasted 1 season.The 4 stars rating is because the no inclusion of English subtitles on the discs only captions that only NTSC Tv Sets can display not PALs like mine."
5,Gift,Bought this for a gift for a friend who is a huge fan. He has told me that he loves it and the quality of the shows is great
1,PAL vs. NTSC format,"I received PAL format DVDs. Has anyone tried them in NTSC based players? As in standalone DVD, blueray or built into a TV, Not PC based players which appear to decode either format. This is intended as a gift."
4,the New Knigth rider,"Being a fan of the original series, i find these new episodes very good it seems to be more oriented towards family than just adults,if you werent a fan of Knigth rider, you migth be after watching these episodes. Im sure the Mustang Cobra helped out also.However the special effects are so low budget and unrealistic that it took out some of the realism, too many green screen effects were used, and too many episodes were the hero saves the day or a dangerous situation gets solved with 2 seconds to spare. That got very old.I can see where they only did one season. Remakes of TV series seldom last long on tv. Other wise if youre a fan of night rider or cool looking Muscle cars this would be the dvds for you."
2,When did KITT come from Cybertron?,"As much as I tend to agree that the original premiere movie was mostly a Mustang commercial, it still spoke for a hopeful future for a new generation of Knight Rider episodes. The episodes I've seen so far (1 and 2), I will admit are along the same level of production skill as the original show in the 80s, but I don't understand what they did with KITT. They went from a nanotech-laced skin than can change a certain degree of the shape and color of the exterior of the car to a full-fledged transformer that can convert from a Mustang to a full-sized 4x4 King cab pickup. I know they won't change that back to the set-up they had in the premiere, but I do hope they try to come back into the realm of scientific plausibility or I'm afraid the show will fall flat before it can get out of the garage."
4,Decent update to a classic,"This was a decent start and I also hope it does well. I remember the old series well and not from reruns. As another reviewer stated this has promise and it can be well received as long as the producers and such do not make it too ""gimicky"" and keep a good story line. Effects are pretty good, though KITT stopping in the subway and Mike in the back jumping onto the platform was badly done for todays ""TV techonology"". All in all not bad and look forward to more."
3,It could go either way,"The first thing I noticed about this show was the acting. It was HORRIBLE!!! I was trying to figure out if the acting was supposed to be this over the top or not. I don't remember the original Knight Rider being this laughable.The plot has a bit of promise and it would either get very interesting in a J. J. Abrams kind of way, or it could get very bad in a, well, J. J. Abrams kind of way.The new Kitt is actually quite incredible and was the highlight of the show. I'd say more, but if you want to catch the show I don't want to blow anything for you. But let me just say, it was exciting to see him in action."
3,"KITT, I NEED HELP!","The series are great, the episodes a little boring now that 20 years have passed and unfortunately the sound has hisses and cracks. Don't they have the technology to restore this? The UK DVD versions have a much better stereo sound. Come on Universal, make the other series better. Thanks for the English subtitles.Vic"
5,Knight Rider for all ages,Awesome Series!! Brought back many great memories. The first half of the season was slow until the middle where it picked up incredibly. The fight scene between KITT and KARR was astounding! Too bad series was cancelled. BRING BACK KNIGHT RIDER! AWESOME SHOW!
4,A Blast from the past,"I was a bit reluctant to the idea that they have changed the car type, however the new mustang still captured the old spirit of the old KITT.I loved the transformation part however i thought if it can transform to more than just a car like KAR did it would be even more interesting.Over All Superb Work."
5,Can I please tell you how much I love Knight Rider?,"Ever since I was little I've been in love with the show. I had the tin lunch box and everything, it even came with a thermos. I was bummed when it was taken off the air, but I was extatic when I found the Sci-Fi channel was playing re-runs. But then they took it off the air too. But then I heard it was coming out on DVD and I was happy again. I bought it the day it came out and it doesn't disappoint. This is one of those series that must be commemorated - the DVD makes it timeless. If only they would start the series up again...."
3,"Great Quality, So-So Show","I received a free digital media credit from Amazon and decided to purchase an episode of Knight Rider. The quality is superb, and the player easy to use, but I didn't particularly care for the show. I did enjoy the original Knight Rider series, but this one seems a bit over the top, placing more weight on the special effects than any semblance of a plot."
1,Ugh,"I have a lot of tolerance for TV. I'll watch a good bit of almost anything. Especially if it has a sci-fi slant to it. However I have to say that this first episode of Knight Rider is some of the worst TV I have ever witnessed. My wife (Who has similar tolerances to TV that I do) and I agreed a few minutes into the episode that we couldn't bear to watch it anymore.The production quality appears to have dropped from the pilot. Parts of the premier appear to have been filmed backstage (Literally, at one point they walk by a door that has Star Trek font lettering on it). The dialogue the acting, even the short bit of plot we managed to suffer through were all miserable.Do not watch this. It is time you will never get back, and your life will be worse having watched."
1,stupid,"the car is tight. the girls are hot. the acting is HORRIBLE. don't watch this thinking it does justice to the original show, cuz it don't!"
5,knight rider season 1,i loved watching knight rider when it first air on tv i can't wait till the rest of the seasons come out on dvd. I want to build kitt for real some day that's my dream
3,Annoying puzzles and No scare,"This game does NOT do it for me (in anyway) except that it's not the worst game. It's somewhat fun (slightly) and you do get to explore but I think it's a hard game. If you skip a step (which there are so many and so easy to miss) your stuck! The puzzles were everywhere and you definately need the walkthrough. There's ALOT of articles you read (I mean ALOT) and I'm no fan of that. It's confusing which and what are your clues to work with. For just about every puzzle I needed a walkthrough (and I'm not one who always needs them). Besides that, I found NO scare factor! And I get scared Very easy. This game to me was more like a book (which isn't horrible) but that's how it felt. If there was more to this game/atleast some scare factor...I would've enjoyed this game more. But there's not. Like I said, wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't really good either. You do get to explore wherever you want, which is fun. And, this game has a cute factor."
3,"Intersting, but WAY overpriced","There are many types of experts listed with feats and such in this book - perhaps 10 or so are useful to the average DM. As a trade paperback, it is overpriced...for the content it should be a $5.99 download or a $9.99 book. There is much more information available various places online about most of these NPC's [the Alchemist and Smith are especially shorted in terms of items creatable - even DMG v1.0 had a potions miscibility table <which this lacks!>]"
4,Old and still being milked.,It is pitiful that a product this old is still being milked for money. These people should spend a few hours and do some work on the product and update it instead of still trying to bleed something dry that should have gone to public domain years ago.
3,Dent remover,"I tried the dent remover on several sizes and shapes of dents and was not successful in completely removing the dent to the point there was no trace of it. Yes, it did pull the dent out to where it was less dented, but one could still see the dent so it was a complete waste of time for me. It might work on a perfectly round dent that is the perfect size and located on a perfect shaped surface but there are very few dents that meet this criteria. It is relatively cheap so if you have the time and enjoy trying stuff like this go for it."
1,Did not work at all,"I followed the directions to a T on two different dents. I tried different glue drying times, different amounts of glue, the two different glue types, and the two different applicators. The glue stuck well to my car (not too bad to get off of the car) but released from the applicator immediately after any pressure was applied. It's supposed to stick the applicator to the car until the dent is fixed. It was never even able to move the sheet metal. The glue gun works fine though quite cheap. The whole system will be returned this week."
2,Not so great for tough locations,"I suspect the device probably works best on flat surfaces and not corners. I had trouble with the glue not staying with the surface of the car, just popped off after several tries...."
3,Does not completely remove small dents,If you have small dents - small like quarter size - this tool will help but removing them completly is very difficult.One tip is to make the dent larger....
3,"Effective, but with a big flaw","This is pretty good for removing dents, as other reviewers have commented. I would say it removes about 80% of a dent. It is better at removing circular dents than vertical dents though. There is also one big drawback... While the actual dent removal is quick, cleaning the glue from the rubber pulling nib afterwards is difficult and very time consuming, even after applying the release agent. I spent far more time just trying to get the glue off than in actually removing dents! What's worse, the yellow glue (for use between temperatures of 55 and 75 degrees) has a tendency to stick to the car surface itself, requiring a round of elbow grease to remove. Don't use this if you are queasy about your car's paint! The red glue (for use between 75 and 90 degrees) is easier to work with. Now if they could make the pulling nibs disposable and include a few dozen of them in the package, that would be a very worthwhile improvement to this product."
5,Great little tool!,"I put an embarrassing dent in the gas tank of my new Harley and was determined to fix it myself rather than buying a new tank. I got this dent repair kit today and can highly recommend it: it pulled the dent almost completely out so that now you have to look for the damage to see it.A couple of observations: pay attention to the temperature you'll be working in; give the glue time a little extra time to set before trying to pull the dent; and the larger puller works better than the smaller one, which had a tendency to pull loose from the glue under pressure. I made two pulls - one to pull out the biggest dent and a second to pull a residual smaller dent. The result isn't perfect but not only is it much better than having the dent, this tool did a much better job than I thought it would.This kit is easy to use and well worth the money. I'd highly recommend it for small do-it-yourself dent repairs."
5,Dent Remover,"Saved me hundreds of dollars by removing hail dents from my autos. Easy to use. Its a little harder to remove dents from car hoods that are aluminum, but if you keep trying it will do it."
2,Not for small Hail Dents,Had a couple of small Quarter size hail dents in my truck. Thought I would give it a try. Didn't have any effect after trying several times. The glue would break apart in the middle and stick to the puller and truck surface. May work for larger dents but did not help me.
2,Save your money,Glue kept pulling off the body. Tried a number of times with same results.Just glad it did not cost more.
1,Does not work/ waste of time and money,"I was hoping this at least work, but it does not do a thing. I have to return this! I tried it many times but does not even touch the dent."
3,It could be a good product,I am going to return this as I won't be able to use this under the recommended temperature range. For that I will have to wait till summer to come. The product description does not have any information that the minimum climate or outside temperature for the glue to work is 55F. I came to know only after opening the box and reading the instructions.
3,"Good idea, but...","Well, I finally had time to try this when I got home from work yesterday at 3pm. Two hours (and two glue sticks) later, the dent (which was about the size of a dime) is still there but less noticeable. I followed the instructions to the tee, but the glue (tried both yellow & red) isn't strong enough. As soon as there's a bit of tension, the pulling nib pops off. Out of the 30+ pulls I did, there was only one instance where it held for a bit longer and made a slight difference in the appearance of the dent. This product is a great idea, but falls short because of the glue's lack of bonding strength."
4,"It does work, but.......","I had a football shaped dent just above the back tire on my Eclipse. And no I couldn't get behind the dent. The dent was about 7 inches long and around 4 inches wide. First thing I did was start in the middle of the dent. Well, that did nothing. So, I thought I would try to work my way from the outer portion of the dent to the middle. After about 2 hours and around 40 trial and error pulls, that spot looks great. It does work, just be prepared to put in some time and have a TON of patience on your side."
3,"Does not work completely, but helps","Know beforehand that this DOES WORK to some extent. 90% of dents will not be perfect after using this (even multiple times), but the dent will be better. It will be around 50-75% shallower and narrower.This is a very cheap fix, and I would recommend to anyone that does not plan on getting it professionally repaired, they just want to make the damage not as noticeable.It is time consuming, and it does not ever fully get out a dent, but it DOES help with the right patience.Make sure you wait sufficiently long for the glue to dry (I recommend 25-30 seconds minimum) before pulling. Good luck!"
4,Highly Entertaining But Somewhat Biased,"This is a book written by a skilled and thoughful volunteer. Although the views expressed by the author will be refuted by those close to the legion, it is nonetheless a good acount of life in the toughest of corps. With fluency, the author details the comradery between himself and a brutal but comical bunch.This is probabaly one of the few personal accounts of a modern legionnaire (1984) and compared to Beau Geste, is a more realistic must-read for anybody contemplating joining this sacred corps."
1,"FAILURE AS A SOLDIER, FAILURE AS AN AUTHOR","After reading ""A mouthful of Rocks"", one would have to wonder if the author succeeded at anything he tried in life, of even cared to finish any commitment. Entering adulthood without a scrap of self esteem, and having the mental maturity and naivete of a child, it is no wonder why all his hopes and dreams were destroyed in the Legion. While suffering from acute chronic alcoholism and clinical depression, if the author had never joined the Legion, we may well be reading a bitter expose he has written about his failed attempt at college, a marriage, or any other various activities which require a commitment and effort.The reader must keep these facts in mind when reading this book, and due to author's emotional problems, must also take the facts as presented with extreme suspicion, as people bitter and disgruntled by an experience will tend to exaggerate circumstances to further their message that they really were not a failure."
3,MOUTHFUL OF CROCK,"Okay, this book might be telling the truth about the French Foreign Legion but who cares? If you realy want to join the Legion this book would not turn anyone off if they really wanted to join. For all those people who deny that what Christian has wrote is untrue must be on another planet. Of course this stuff happens and not only in the French Foriegn Legion but in Army's all across the world.The book is very boring to read and the literature is shocking, this book was not planned out and it seems a 10 year old wrote it. The book centres around himself, at one moment he complains about the hard work and then the next he is bored with nothing to do. If people want to know about what military life is really like then read the book, but if you know what happens then don't bother. There are plenty of other execellent books on the foreign legion and this is not one of them."
1,A view to publishing....,"This is not a good book. Having spent half my life in the army I can't understand why Jennings got so far into the Legion. It's like he was thinking about writing it all the while instead of getting on with his life and work there. He's almost too articulate for his own sanity.I also had the feeling there is a second voice in the writing, either an editor, or ghost writer, who is leaving things out. One thing I found disturbing, there's a thread of homosexuality running through this book. It's as if Jennings wants to be the man he longs to be, a sort of super-heterosexual-action-man, and hopes it will rub off on him by joining the French Foreign Legion where there must be the type of man he longs to be. When Jennings discovers this is not the way to manhood he deserts."
5,DAVID ALLAN COE LIVE AT BILLY BOB'S,"I think this is a wonderful, dvd, the sound is great,nice songs,would love to see more dvds by,D.A.C. I think he is a wonderfull, songwriter,singer, and he knows his stuff. If u are a D.A.C. FAN buy it,you will not be disappointed, if not, then give it a try!~~~~~you will fall in love with him and his music~~~~as he is the most favorite, in both, mine and my sons dvd collection!"
4,One of my Favorite Books,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I've read it at least half a dozen times and still love it. Some of the terms I've carried throughout my life, like ""doodlehum"" and ""brace of roods,"" originate in this book. The only problem I have with it is that it's just not long enough. Zelazny could have easily fleshed this book out to at least twice its size. There's nothing anyone can do about that, but it's still a fun, fast read."
2,Ouch it burns,"Unfortunately I have been very disappointed with this particular model. Although the removeable cooking surfaces are easy to clean.....they fall off all of the time exposing the very hot elements, making it impossible to clip back on to salvage the waffle batter which was already poured onto the lower surface. I have burned myself several times because of this poor design. The problem seems to be with the prongs which clip into the base. As I try to close the waffle maker, the cooking surface either falls off or swings forward. Not very handy and yes I have tried all of the troubleshooting recommendations from the manufacturer....into the garbage it goes....maybe Cuisinart may be a better choice. This could be why this product is not available at this time????Culinary Crafter"
3,Not perfect :(,"The waffles come out ok, but the back waffles cook differently than the front waffle. Also, I wish there were a timer that beeped when the waffle is done. My waffles seem to need 3:15 minutes. The bottom cooks differently than the bottom. Sometimes, you can see a round heat ring in the middle of the 2 waffles. I think it's from the heating coil or something. But, the waffles come out tasty, crispy, and fluffy. Too bad it's just not perfect. :("
3,Cooks unevenly,"Apparently the big selling point for a rotating waffle maker is that it cooks more evenly. This one didn't cook evenly at all. Parts of the waffle were very dark, other parts light. Truly, this waffle maker wasn't any better than a $15 Toastmaster I picked up years ago."
5,Great for its price!!,"I have only used this once, but this thing makes great waffles!! you just plug it in, spray oil on the plates, pour the waffle mix all around (make sure you don't overpour else it will leak out when you close the plates) and then close the cover, 10 seconds, flip, and wait for a couple minutes until the green light comes on. Although the light is at the bottom of the maker now that you have flipped it over, you can see the light from the reflection on the anti-spill plate, which is not that bad.The only down thing is that it's a bit heavy.. but it's not designed to be as portable as my cell phone..."
3,waffle lovers,"I was excited to get this waffle maker, but was kinda disappointed when I saw it. Too bulky,poorly designed and waffles not that good in this maker.I tried waffles done in maker that cost 29.99 and did not find a difference."
3,Authentic Liege Belgian Waffler BUT Uneven Browning,"PROS:- Attractive brushed steel design.- Adjustable heat setting.- This waffle maker comes as close as you can get to true Liege (Belgian sugar waffles ~ not to be confused with regular Belgian waffles) waffle irons.CONS:- Uneven browning. The two waffle sections cook at different rates. It's bad enough to leave one undercooked or overcooked, when the other is ""just right"".- No built-in timer.So, if you only plan on making one waffle at a time, then it's an awesome machine. Otherwise, I would skip it in favor of something like the Presto 03510, which browns evenly (even though it lacks adjustable heat settings)."
5,retired homeowner,"experienced this product while traveling by car across the US at hotels breakfast areas. It works just like we experienced, love it. Came quickly and in perfect condition."
5,Great waffle maker.,"I was impressed with the solid construction, and the results, which after all are the important thing, lived up to the qualityof the iron. It's an appliance that I'm sure we'll be using fora long time. The instruction booklet didn't bother me, as itdid some people. There are lots of waffle recipes available, andI've tried several of them. They have all turned out great."
1,we felt cheated,"my husband and i have followed chet atkins music for years. westarted with many of his records, then cassette tapes and nowdecided to add his wonderful music in cd form.what a total shock to find as we were playing ""chet atkinsa life in music"" that it wasn't all music.we didn't need so many people telling us he was great. wefelt we had been cheated. we also paid $18. for the cd andnothing to show for it.helen matson"
2,Re-issue of previos release,"All the positive comments are true, but this was available under the same title with a little more interview and a bonus feature. The only new value is the nice cover photo."
2,Not pure joy,"This is a documentary, this is not a performance DVD. I am pretty disappointed. If you like recording PBS documentaries, then buy this DVD, it has that special salutory educational theme. If you really want to see Chet play..... well, buy a CD and use your imagination instead."
5,"Play it again, Larry--LOUD!","If the Clash came back they'd be Black 47 and why the hell wouldn't they be proud and glad to be? Rebel stance, laughing good hearts, brave enough to take a bullet and keep rockin'--these lads don't mess. Fans love them enough to catch dozens of shows a year, beauties in the front row lipsynching every word while the uileann pipes wail and the brass section soars. Hey, you have to see and hear them to really get it--and they play everywhere from Shea Stadium to Times Square to Argentina, the hardest working band in America!This second live cd brings you close to the Black 47 gig. You can taste the whiskey burnin'down as you shout back at Larry Kirwan--""Where the hell are ya now?""! A wonderful roiling roistering party of a record. Get it and play it, you'll play it again. And again and again after that. Loud. Guaranteed."
1,Not for your average listner,The music is so bizzar that I couldn't figure out what they were trying to acomplish. The song Brazil was aborted.
3,Wallace Stainless Steel Continental Bead Flatware,"The spoons and forks are heavy--great quality. The knives however, spot and rust immediately."
5,Best flatwear I have ever owned,I have owned this set four years now. I find knives in the yard and spoons in sand box and am missing several pieces. I have never seen any rust on any of my knives and they have been abused ( kids and grand kids ). The weight of the pieces are hefty and feel substantial in the hand. The length of the dinner forks are great ( longer than most ) and the knife blade is very wide. I did a special search to find this exact set again. My wife and I are 50 yrs old and we have been through a few sets of inferior flatware. These are quite the opposite.
1,a great disappointment,"I purchased a set of stainless flatware for my vacation home from Wallace with which I was delighted. Needing to replace the flatware at my permanent home, I ordered flatware with similar criteria from the same manufacturer, since the previous set was unavailable. I was extremely disapointed in the quality... the ""hand"" was poor, the balance even poorer and the workmanship was non-existent...the set looked to have been stamped and was not even centered on the utensil. I'm sure I could have found similar quality and at much lower price at a big box store. To top it off, I paid for shipping to my home and paid almost $20 to get the product returned to Barrons. Two lessons learned...pay attention to the ratings and always order directly from Amazon...Barrons customer service is an oxymoron."
1,Poor Quality Stainless,"I've had this set for about two years now. At first I was thrilled with the selection of utensils in it and felt that it was a great value. However, after a few months I began to notice that all of the forks were rusting between the tines, which makes them look like they are dirty and have caked-on food between the tines. This kind of poor quality stainless is typical, in my experience, of stainless products that are manufactured in China. Chinese flatware was exactly what I was trying to avoid but unfortunately that's exactly what I got when I purchased this set."
1,Light weight.,"I expected this set to pretty much match the set I purchased several years ago from Williams Sonoma - same make, pattern and both state they are 18/10. But this set is no where near the weight of my other flatware which I absolutely love. I don't know how it can really be 18/10??? I feel quite disappointed as Williams Sonoma no longer sells this pattern and I was hoping to have more of it."
3,Fair flatware for the price,"The Wallace Continental Bead 65 piece 18-10 stainless flatware arrived about a week and a half after order was placed. It's acceptable, but compared to an older similar set given to me years ago, it comes up short. I do like the style and size of pieces, but it's lighter in weight than I thought it would be. In fact, I have a 24 piece set of 18-8 stainless that's much heavier and has a brighter finish. I haven't used the Wallace yet, so I can't address the staining problem mentioned by others. Overall, it's fair flatware, a good deal for the price."
1,WAY OVERSIZED!,"I own a set of this flatware, purchased maybe 10-12 years ago.For some reason Wallace is now producing it in a super-size version. NOt sure why.I am not a small person, and this set was clownishly oversized, like 50% larger than my original set.Not sure who could comfortably eat with this size of flatware."
5,Worked out great,"Was updating a late 1980s bathroom. This purchase was perfect for the remodel. I did not install it myself, but it was so easy, and really finished the new look for the bathroom. Just be sure to order the converstion kit to complete the install. This trim kit looks great!"
5,Bleeding Kansas,"This is a very good general history of the era with significant details to entice more research. It is well written and touches on part of the History of Kansas that is often overlooked as the precursor to the American Civil War. Hope that Etcheson continues the work on the era and perhaps follows in the footsteps of a noted early 1900s, empowered female historian of Kansas, Anna Heloise Abel whose work is incredibly accurate especially as it has to do with the overwhelming conspiracy to extinguish the titles Indian tribes held in the permanent Indian Territory of Kansas."
5,SHEENA EASTON - Private Heaven,"This is a wonderful LP with the hit song ""STRUT"". Take the flash back to the 80's with this pop album. Sheena set the charts on fire with this album and her other's released between 1983 and 1987. Sheena easton's song ""STRUT"" was one of the most requested video's ever on the start up music video channel MTV. Buy this album and listen to it the way it was meant to be heard on Vinyl on your turntable."
1,Sugar Walls and Strut.,"I've being heard this songs for long time and watching video. Also, she was an actress of the T.V. show of Miami Vice. However, she write her songs, and she had a beautiful voice that she sing on her own. Therefore, she sing her duet with Kenny Rogers that song ""We're got tonight"" it's sound romantic. Even though, she was married along with her kids, and she divorce and adopted her kids. Because she had nothing to do with it. She made up her song, including her song title with her albums. That she can make her song."
4,The Spiritual Man,This book was a wonder to read and inlightnment to things I did not know. The book is well written and it explain in full detail with reference scriptures to confirm what it saids.I will recomend this book to other to read and get an understanding for their spiritual concerns.Thanks for your speedy shipping and you on hand books.
2,Think Over Again,"Watchman Nee is one a great cloud of witnesses in China, and I respect him much. However, some of his teachings may not be close as what Bible says. Especially in his concept of Spirit, Soul & Body, it will easily make us to live in the world separately, and we somehow may be proud of using our own effort to please God, just like the Pharisees. 1 Thes. 5:23 not necessarily means we should be separated by three parts. I didn't see the other parts of Bible has that kind of teaching."
5,The Spiritual Man,Thsi is probably the best book I've ever read (Not counting the Bible of course). It is a major eye opener and illustrates how to really live a spiritually controlled life in obedience to God's will and away from the world and enemy's influence.
5,Love it!,I am always looking for more insight into our infaniate God and this book is very deep and has a lot of meat to digest.
4,Very good,"I started this book one year and finished it the next. It's not difficult to read, but it is extremely deep and one is left wanting to think about the ideas being presented. The author initially published this book in 1928. He presents the idea that God is tripartite and since God made man in His image, we too are tripartite - the body, the soul and the spirit. Mr. Nee builds an excellent case for this and backs it up with Scripture. He then goes on to explain how one should live a Spirit controlled life as opposed to a soul controlled life (the soul being the mind and emotions etc...). Very thought provoking. Disclosure: I read volume I alone."
4,Charlie Brown finally kisses the little red-haired girl!,"Although ""It's Your First Kiss"" was a relatively late addition to the Peanuts pantheon, it still retains some of the charm of classic Schulz storylines. Linus is there, dispensing bits of understated romantic wisdom, with blanket in tow. There are some classic football scenes (with coach Peppermint Patty amusingly evading her players' question upon viewing her game plan: ""So, are we the Xs or the Os?""). And Charlie Brown's google-eyed panic attacks and his climactic, slo-mo walk down the aisle toward his first kiss always throw our kids into fits of laughter. A worthy addition to any Peanuts library."
3,Kew-Well Concert Footage Interrupted by Interviews.....,"....I found myself wanting to fast forward thru the interview parts 'cause U-Ray's live concert was sooooo good. Editor's fault. They coulda had all the hometown interviews up front and did the concert uninterrupted.It also miffed me a bit that he did my favorite U-Ray tune ""My Way"" at the beginning. I would have envisioned it in a bang-up finish at the concerts end. To the jam-meister's credit, there were plenty of awesome tic-lock type movements, great spins that were quicker than lazerflash and he did keep his hometown audience of mostly teenaged lil sisters well entertained.Interesting also was the oldies melody consisting of ol' Bobby Brown tunes, ol' Force MDs, ol' LLCool J...to me he did not require that nod to the hip-hop soul raconteurs before him to put off a great show. A lil more of them great steps wudda made this a classic videoconcert....but other than these few peeves I had, you are gonna find this enjoyable."
5,Usher is so hot!,"I've seen all of his videos and he looks great on it.I'm dying to meet him and if only i get a chance to see him or watch any of his video i'd be the happiest girl in the entire Universe.I'm collecting all Usher's posters and all his album. One thing that i like most is ""Bedtime"", he looks so sexy and ooooh! so great in this video.I really love the way he moves,and i'm sure that i'm dying to dance with him someday.My classmates are jealous on me co'z in my locker i have all his posters and in my room too.Sometimes my teacher gets mad at me co'z i wasn't paying attention to what he was saying, co'z you know what i'm like daydreaming about him.I just wanna say that i really love him soooooo... much!"
1,If I only had the money!,This book was interesting to see how rich people pretend to be poor. It's obvious the author doesn't know what it's really like to start out from school with nothing. My guess is she never ate macaroni and cheese 7 nights a week and wished she could afford peanut butter. She probably ate sirloin and wished it was porterhouse!That's how this book made me feel. It assumes you have money and alot of choices. It doesn't help with the (limited) choices if you don't have a trust fund.
1,"Not Helpful, Not Funny","I read some of the reviews on Amazon and should have paid more attention. I knew not to expect a helpful book, but some of the reviewers said the book was humourous. NOT! There is no point or purpose to this book."
1,Disappointing,"My daughter got this book as a graduation gift. She's still not talking to the relative who gave it to her. The title is misleading, beacuse there really isn't any information on how a young person can stand on his/her own two feet. The least of my daughter's worries is how to decorate her apartment. She needed more substantial advice on entering and surviving in the workplace, balancing a budget, setting priorities on expenses. This book offers none of that and was very disappointing."
4,Helpful and Funny,"I just read Ingrid Meyer's ""Your Own Two Feet . . ."" and bought it for a friend's daughter, who's graduated. She liked it. I plan to get a copy for my daughter, who'll graduate next year. Great tips and amusing advice."
4,"A light, funny read","Meyer's book is funny and well-written. Sprinkled throughout with tales from the author's own experiences, it is a fast and easy read. This book is best for the grad who has never lived on his or her own before, and probably too basic for those who had their own apartments, jobs and roommates while in college. While not a comprehensive guide, it does give good ideas on where to start. Don't depend on it to tell you everything, but count on it to give you a push in the right direction."
1,Is This Book for Real?,"This book is a fluffy stream of consciousness of unresearched rubbish. Near as I can figure, the author has no credentials on which to craft a self-help book. No single topic is given any depth. Inaccuracies abound. The entire ""manual"" seems based on her own limited and sheltered experience.As examples, advice on getting a car includes asking a relative for the gift of one! And darn if her first car wasn't a gift from grandma. Words are spent in helping the young graduate decide between buying or renting. Unless the grad is starting out with a healthy trust fund, buying is usually not an option to consider. To meet new friends, apparently the author feels you should talk to any stranger anywhere and develop a friendship. Mercifully, she follows up such odd advice with safe sex tips.It is an absolute mystery that this book got published in the first place. It will be more mysterious that anyone should proceed to buy it. It's too late for me. Save yourselves!"
1,Someone else's shoulders and how to sit on them,"I picked up this book as a graduation gift for a friend's son. The title seemed cute and appropriate and skimming through it in the bookshop, it did seem to cover a lot of the things a grad would find useful. My friend's son thought differently. He thought that it was a joke, and particularly useful for those people who do not need to worry about where their next meal or rent is going to come from. After reading it thoroughly myself I find myself in total agreement. It is educational to see how the well heeled view the world but I am afraid that for the most part most of us have a somewhat different view. And I thought that education was intended to broaden the mind."
5,WE LOVE THE BLOBBIES,"Each of my children, ages 11 and 8, received one as gifts this summer. They liked them so much we ended up getting the whole collection! My 11 year-old is not into toys like he use to be, but he really like Blobbie Orange-The Eagle and my 8 year-old's favorite is Blobbie Yellow, the Dolphin. My personal favorite is Blobbie Blue, the Llama. Each Blobbie has their own personality and you can even take a personality test on the Pers website to see which Blobbie is most like you! The book is fun too. We also have Pookie, the Penguin. These toys are VERY REASONABLY PRICED FOR THE SIZE AND QUALITY. I highly recommend the Blobbies and cannot wait for the second series to be released!"
5,Wow! A plush Transformer!,"I used to love the transformers/gobots toys when I was a kid, and I think it's so fun to now have a plush version of them!The toy is large, very well made, and the plush material is very soft.There is a sturdy zipper in the back that you have to open in order to transform the ""blobbie"".My nephews and nieces love the Blobbies!!!"
3,Eh.,"It's ""ok."" It's not substantial, so to me it's overpriced. Cats have lost interest in it. If you want a great toy at a great price, try theCat Charmer."
4,excellent,"Hi,This seller is excellent, I order the book and got it in a very short time. and the condition was very accurate as it was advertise. thanks."
4,Good but not perfect,"The only thing that I can add to the the reviews already posted on this device is my own experiences - we ordered 2 of the 'bulk packaged' bundles which include the headset and the charger.Positives:- No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I can't stand those and, apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off, by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives:- My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.- The charging interface is not a mini-USB but some weird, proprietary plug.- If there is a way to attach this to the left ear, I am not aware of it.At this time, my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present :)"
4,HS850 Hands Down.... Literally!,"Although some other reviews have not been so favorable, I have found all features a plus with the possible exception of the highest volume setting being a little on the low side.Definite recomendations for the HS850! Look arround and you can find great deals on this item! Don't pay retail!"
1,can't hear anything,"I bought this because I had just bought a Motorola RAZR phone and had trouble hearing the phone. I had intended to buy a Jabra headset, but when my wife was shopping at cartoys, the people there said that a motorola product would work so well with the phone, since it's motorola. In a quiet room, the headset is fine. The instant that there is any background noise, such as a bus, walking down the street, etc., the headset is useless because you can't hear anything. I tried to take the headset back to cartoys, but they wouldn't accept the return without the manual.Summary:1) Don't buy motorola. The headsets are useless and the phones are too quiet. If you want an expensive toy that doesn't work well as a phone, the RAZR is the one for you.2) don't buy wireless plans or products from cartoys. Even though Cingular gave us 30 days to try the phone out, cartoys only gives 14 days, so we weren't able to cancel and switch back to Verizon without having to pay cartoys $300 per phone."
2,Barely adequate,"When I bought this case shortly after the TT came out, there weren't a lot of choices. I settled on this case because I don't like metal, but now wish I'd bought the metal case. My TT is a very important tool for me in my work as an ER nurse, and it is aggravating to pull it out to access ePocrates and get a blank screen because it accidentally got turned on in my pocket and drained the battery. Even tho I have it set to turn itself off after a minute, it must get turned on frequently as I standup, sit down, and move about the department. At least once a week this happens, where I'll go to work with a full battery, and try to turn it on to find it drained.The case is nice looking, and fine if you carry your TT in a briefcase or a large purse or backpack. If you have to carry it in a pocket, as I do, you will not be happy."
3,AmbientGroove & Trancy,The album taken together is put together after the name: in a loop format in the vein of higher quality ambient world (sort of). What is the highlight though is track #3 Diwana. Awesome song full of spiritual vigor and essence. Close your eyes and experience the great dragon.
2,Read the first two chapters,"After the first two chapters of An Essay on The Principle of Population, Malthus rambles on and then ties it up at the end. You only need the first two chapters to understand Malthus' argument."
3,No marks...but...,"I can't figure out how to go back and see what the rating on this book was from the seller. It smells like an attic and is bent at the top and bottom right hand side (the whole book, not just the cover or a few pages) - there are no marks in the book and it's readable so I'll just air it out. So depending on the rating it may be in exactly the condition stated - it's not bad - it's just not what I'm used to from Amazon resellers. Maybe this is the new normal - I'll still buy them over the new books any day of the week!"
5,The ultimate Dream workbook,Want to learn your own personal dream symbolism? This book will teach you how to get the most from your own dreams not someone elses'. This is a great guide to personal insights into who you are and how you process your own experiences through dreams. This is a great Dream Workbook.
3,Room For Improvement,"This was not exactly what I was seeking in a workbook. It has quite a few excercises, but only a few of them really grabbed me. Many of them felt self evident to me, which would have been fine if she had developed them in more detail. Instead this book was emphatically written in layman's terms, and I felt like each chapter hurried on to the next. While the dream examples are unique, and riveting, I felt the author depended on them too heavily. I would have prefered more general instruction from the author. I am keeping this book in my collection though. Maybe I will come back to it and appreciate it more in the future."
4,Urban Fantasy with an Upstate New Yok Twist,"Rootes creates, or shall we say, relives his realistic Upstate New York adolescence-coming-of-age in his first novel Soul Takers. His work exhibits the energy of a new writer with the seasoned abilities of an old pro. The way he puts a spin on the old vampire tales, blends it to an erotic, romantic, sensual, suspense thriller is really an unique accomplishment indeed. The characters are real. We can feel for them. We are are left wanting more. I can picture this being a critically acclaimed movie with all the bells and whistles special effects that would probably be a flop at the box offices. Oh, well. The true artist is intrinsically motivated. Rootes has learned this by now, no doubt. Soul Takers is definitely a good read. And now we know where all of the Missing Children go........"
4,Captivating and dreamlike,I think he draws you deeper and deeper into the novel until your completely lost in it. I believe that under the heavy sexual content is desire and passion beyond what ordinary people could ever imagine it to be like. I think that the book has a very good and holding storyline. The characters are each captivating in their own way. I cannot wait for more intense reading.
4,Something for most everyone,"I've already requested Mr. Rootes to write sequels and prequels to this book. It's sexy, has horror, drama, suspense and more! It had me worried for characters right to the end. I want to read more!"
5,Another great DVD from Lauren Brooks,"I am not pregnant but felt this DVD still provided a great workout, got my heart rate up. I have Lauren's first DVD Ultimate Sculpt and Condition Volume 1 and was ready to try something new but I was not ready for Volume 2 so I decided to give this DVD a try and I am so glad I did. I plan on alternating between baby bells and volume 1. I love the way I feel when I workout with kettlebells and Lauren is a great instructor."
3,"Good exercise, boring DVD","I expected Lauren Brooks to be a more dynamic instructor. Her delivery is bland and monotone.The workout segments are appropriate for pregnancy. However, there is not much instruction; the assumption is that you not only have the ability to exercise, but also that you are familiar with kettlebells."
2,shredded pillows and topper,"pillows are hard and take a while to work in to be able to sleep on them. The topper is good, but I would like it to be a little harder."
3,so so movie,it was good in ways but not what i expected. i thougt id see more things per epsiode than i did. you saw some of the objects and the mumies but mostly it was interviews from people.you also got to see some reinactment which was nice to. i just would of prefered to of seen more of the items and less of the people talking about discovery. you still dd get to see some nice items and get told about them though
4,Gripping!,"Have been a Lois Duncan fan all my life. This book in particular is one I've enjoyed since I was a teenager. Lois has a unique way of slowly pulling a reader into the world she has created. Like a fish after bait a reader will find themselves quickly hooked and unable to put the book down. After all these years, I still get chills reading this book (as I do most of her young adult suspense novels!).You won't be disappointed!"
5,WOW! One word... SCARY!...,At first I thought that past artists going around controlling 4 teen girls was the stupidest thing I had EVER heard of. Than I read the book. It scared the [heck] out of me. I didn't sleep without my light on for days. It's hard to find horror stories that aren't corny. This is one of the very few I LOVED AND WOULD RECCOMOEND TO ANY ONE!
5,AWESOME,"I thought that Down a Dark Hall was a very riveting book and has so much description. It actually made you feel as though you were in the characters' shoes. Also there were some great ideas in this novel. The author must of worked hard to come up with these ideas. Although I found some parts funny or scary and even just plain boring, it was awesome. I totally recommend this book to people who like mysteries and books that keep you on your feet guessing. Down a Dark Hall was a total page turner."
2,Yuck,"When I bought this book I expected it to be really great like Stranger With My Face or even half decent like Locked in Time, but this book was so unlike Lois Duncans other books. The ending (which to me is what leaves the lasting impression) was VERY abrupt and when you put the book down you have so many questions like, ""Did Lynda really escape the burning building?"" or ""Will Kit ever close to portal to the haunting ghosts?"" I couldn't stand it the way it never really ended and I couldn't beleive at first that it actually had. Overall, the book was pretty spooky, no romance at all, and was a page turner, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I do suggest that you read this, though, if you are a Lois fan and have read the rest of her books, but otherwise I wouldn't take my time to."
3,this was really scarey,this is a great book that makes you want to keep reading. it is about a girl named kit who has to go to a boarding school while her parents are away on their honeymoon. She soo finds out tat there were only 4 students excepted in to the school and when they find out why there life is in danger. This is a great suspenseful story.
3,down a dark hall by lois duncan,"This story is called Down a Dark Hall by Lois Duncan. A girl name Kit finishes high school and she is going to collage. She goes with a couple of friends to a school called Blackwood. Blackwood is like a huge mansion. It is always dark at night and no one can see anything. One day, she goes in the hallway, became afraid, and realizes someone is trying to scare her everyday. However, she does not know who would scare her. I would not recommend this book because my friends would find it is a story that is not interesting to them, or one they can relate to.ali23@dhs"
3,Down a Dark Hall,I thought the book was good because it was scary and I did not know what would happen next after a cliff hanger at the end of the chapters. In the middle of the book it got really good and good things started to happen.Then the end came and it did not say what happened at the end of the book.
5,Wonderful,"I remember years ago when I first picked up this book I really didn't expect much from it. I must say I was blown away with because it had elements that I loved. Ever since I read this book, I've been a Lois Duncan fan. The book is about a a fourteen-year old girl named Kit going to a special boarding school named Blackwood while her mother and her new stepfather take a long Honeymoon. But Kit soon finds out some thing strange: they are only four girls in the boarding school. What follows is a supernatural mystery. Kit and her new friend Sandy soon find out the reasons why they were selected to attend Blackwood. Soon their lives are at stake and it's up to Kit to find a way out.Great read. I highly recommend it."
2,So disappointed!,"This was a great book 25 years ago - yes, I am dating myself - and I purchased it more out of nostalgia than anything. It's been ""modernized"" - the plot now mentions ethernet cables, etc., and I was disappointed. The charm of the story has been diluted. Will have to go to Abe Books or similar to find original."
3,Eerie,This book is really good. I was really scared when I read it because Lois Duncan is such a good author you never know what is going to happen next. She can really write books that give you the chills. This is a book about Kit who goes to a boarding school and she immediately feels something is wrong with it. She does make friends because there are only 4 students there. They all are discovering special talents they never knew they had before they arrived at Blackwood. Read for yourself and find out how this strange events are occuring.
5,Wonderful,"All I can say is that this is a great book. It is very suspenseful and has a great ending. I loved it so much that i went out and bought it. It may be a little hard to get into, but once you do, you'll love it."
5,Duncan's best book ever!,"I not only was intrigued by the captivating plot, but Duncan's combination of sheer fascination and wonderful insights of old famous painters, poets, pianists, and mathemeticians made the book a real page turner. This book definitely deserves five stars!"
5,This book is creepy yet delicious!,"I love it. It didn't give me nightmares, but it's so well written. So congrats Lois, you have a new 11 year old fan!"
4,Down a Dark Hall,"When I bought Down a Dark Hall I knew it was going to be interesting. Louis Duncan is one of my favorite authors. Durring Down a Dark Hall a 14 year-old girl named Kit is chosen to go to the private school Blackwood School for Girls. Durring her time at Blackwood some unusual things happen to her and the few other girls that are there. Kit runs into some problems while being at this school, some of which she doesn't know what to do about. Ever since Kit has been at the school she has had a weird feeling about it. She's not sure what it is but she does know that it isn't good.The biggest problem at the school is when she is sleeping. Soon she becomes too scared to sleep but she has no choice but to fall asleep. The other girls that are at the schools are having similar problems but none of them want to face Madame Duret the school boards leader. This is a intereting book that combines mystery with common real life problems."
4,very good book!,"I must say this was a really really good book! I think that any reader who just wants a good page turner should definitely try this one. This book is about a girl named Kit and her mother has recently remarried. Her parents are going on a European tour and they are leaving kit in a boarding school while they are gone. When she arrives at the boarding school for girls, she realizes that something just isn't right. The place just seems sinister. She is very surprised by the fact that are only three other girls that come to the school. They were the only other ones that passed the unusual test. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I'll go ahead and tell you that it is surprising and was no what I was expecting. I think that if you like to read an easy-read book and a thriller and suspense and mystery all mixed up together then you will like this one a lot!"
4,"Read it at age 10 (approx.), found it very absorbing","Down a Dark Hall was a book I could not put down as a 10-11 year old girl. I imagine it suits young people who are interested in the supernatural, who have been betrayed or abandoned by important adults in their lives, and who are trying to overcome personal, painful obstacles. It was mysterious, frightening, and thrilling. Those readers who find it ""boring"" or cannot relate to it may be too old for it (14 is pushing it) or may not have anything in their lives to connect to it. It must be a pretty powerful book, because I read it about 37 years ago (!), I still recall much of the plot, and I have not picked it up (or even seen it) since I first read it. Go Ms. Duncan!"
3,This was a good book,"Mrs. Wagener's 6th period class said- Some thought the book was not that exciting. Some liked the book because it was interesting and it had a good ending. The book was scary and interesting because of the ghosts and the surprises. This book was really scary, exciting and had you at the edge of your seat at the ending."
2,Disappointing,"This book looked very interesting so I chose to read it for an 8th grade assignment. The book was very thrilling until about the middle of the book, when the conclusion suddenly became evident. The rest of the book was very boring for the most part, because you already knew what was going to happen. I can say that this was one of the worst books I have ever read."
2,What happened?,"I disliked ""Down A Dark Hall"" because Lois Duncan's books from the 1970s were much better. I don't know if Duncan was trying to modernize her writing style, but it sure as hell didn't work. ""Down A Dark Hall"" was too easy to read and like too many other books I've read."
2,"DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","This book was ok. but i expected more from lois Duncan. I would read her other books, but not this one. the only reason i had to start and finish this book is because it was for school. We had to get into groups and read one of the lois duncan books. And i was stuck with this one. theres not enough exciting events and things happening in this book. Don't waste your time people. PLEASE DON'T. READ SOMETHING BETTER, like ( I know what you did last summer). You'll be more satisfied with that one."
3,"Great graphics, but gameplay is lacking","While WWR is great visually and at first play, it becomes a bit tedious later on. The Challenge course is fun, but you have to complete the Championship in first place to unlock more Challenge levels. Control is erratic, and it's hard to hold a straight course even on level open ground.Don't get me wrong, this game is a blast to play with another person especially; the jumps and the ability to flip your vehicle are worth the game time.I wouldn't recommend paying full-price for it; the $19.98 here is a much better value than the original $49.99. Rent/borrow before you buy to see if this is truly something you'd want to purchase; it might not be the off-road game for everyone."
3,It's RAGE,"Wild Wild Racing is a racing game for the PS2. WWR is long, If you play a track in this game it will take you about 20 minutesYou will like this game if you like USA, India, Iceland, Mexico or 4x4 racingthis game came out in 2000 it could still be called a PS game well it was a good start up game for the PS2 1-2 players is not fun ether if you like a game like this buy it first if you don't like them then don't even bother renting it"
2,Wild Wild Racing,"This game got a 2 star rating because of its graphics, the rest got a zero. The game was not fun but annoying and agrivating. To begin, the controls were horrible when you start. After a while you get used to the controls but never start to like them.Also, hopefully you wont get hit by another car because your car will spin around and off course causing you to come in 4th place. Also, hopefully you wont flip over because when you will automatically get put in 4th place even if you were in 1st. Dont try to hit other cars to knock them off course because it wont work, you will just get messed up driving and lose. Theses are just a few problems with this game. Dont even rent this game and definately dont buy it."
1,A TERRIBLE GAME!!,"When I saw this game in the store, I thought, Cool, an off-road racing game. So I purchased it, popped it in my PS2 and I was dissapointed. This could be the least entertaining video game I have ever had the displeasure to play. DO NOT BUY IT!! If you want a racing game get Ridge Racer V."
1,Rent it first,I recently rented this game and I feel that the steering could have been better. It was Sluggish and hard to get the vehicle to turn left and right. If you like racing games I suggest you rent or buy something else. I am just glad that I rented it first and saved my self (dollar amount). It has great graphics and the head to head game play is quite good but very sluggish. It wasn't worth the 4.99 I paid to rent it.
1,SUCKS!!!!,"If you buy this game, you will get ripped off!! My daddy bought me this game and I really feel sorry for him for spending that much money. Once you play it, you don't want to play it again, what a dissapointment."
1,... Racing,"This game, to me, was horribly made. It had no ""new"" aspect or quality that hasn't been done many times before, no part of this game sets itself apart from any other racing game from the Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis. Their are NO physics in this game, now I think that physics are a crucial part of any racing game, as we are in the 21st century and it's not very hard to see that to make a game real, you need realistic physics! Their's no drifting, sliding, ""realistic"" jumps or even realistic turning, everything depends on your 3 stats, which means that the creators we're just very lazy people, or they don't know we have a little known word, called ""gravity"". The levels are very plain, nothing stands out, your just racing around within the borders of a type of fence or barrier, so theirs no exploring. What you should do, is just play it smart and wait for Gran Turismo 3 to come out, and get the best of the racing genre."
1,What a disappointment,"The graphics are ok, the controls are easy, but the overall the game suffers. You only get a few courses, and those are extremely long, uncreative and boring. You get little choice on cars as well, and they lack excitement as well. If you like off-road games, try another title. This one is a bust."
2,Coe,"Just a rat bag, this guy is an insult to the music business and should be banned from appearing anywhere"
5,String Quartet Delight,"This tribute to Haydn is spectacular. Their playing is impeccable, with fine definition and movement. I especially enjoy their offering of Opus 33, The Joke. It is light and playful and bounces with liltiness.This is truly refreshing music to listen to. The bonus CD of works by Mozart, Shostakovich, Dvorak, et al is wonderful as well. This finales in Beethoven's op. 59 for String Quartet.Magnificent!Thanks Emerson for 25, may 25 more be yours and your fans!"
2,Just bland,"While I would not like to be as severe as J. F. Laurson before me, I do agree with all of the points of his review. I would not call the Haydn Project by the Emerson Group tedious, just bland, lukewarm and, well?, petty-minded? However, for those who do know the music well, listening to the CD is quite interesting.I do like the Quattuor Mosaiques, I also like the Lindsay's, I can forgive them their ""imperfect ensemble"" - as one can more technically call their playing - for their attitude to the music. I would like also to mention the Alban Berg Quartet, whose big and muscular Haydn (in op. 76) would not be to everybody's liking, but all the same the energy in the performance does appeal to me."
1,"good idea, but it does not work consistently for memory sticks",Memory sticks only periodically work. This item was a bust.
2,Misleading Cover Art,Don't buy this DVD! The package art is awesome but really misleading. Even the title menus are well done and artistic. But the actual video content is someone holding a consumer camcorder and filming tokyo street performers. The audio is terrible and editing is slow and boring. There is no commentary or interviews or anything worth watching.
1,Misleading purchase,"Firstly, as soon as I opened the box, it struck me that the external drive received was not the same as the unit I ordered online. Further investigation suggests that the unit received is an update of the one I thought that I was purchasing online. Secondly, I purchased a new Dell laptop running Vista & wanted to be able to pefrform complete system back-ups, however, going through the Recovery Manager, when I used the full system back-up option, it gave an error message that the drive does not have a certain compatibility to support full systems back-ups. This is a major dissapointment also. I now use the file back-up option, but this is not want I had wanted to do."
5,a good rear saver,It has been used to back my primary computer. Having a denial of service virus is heart sickening. I bought a second one for my secondary computer and it was good buy even though it cost one dollar more.
3,good dub techno in need of some editing,"Just when you think we've filled the quota of dub-influenced techno producers, well, add Dub Taylor (Alex Krueger) to the list of on-point talents. The sounds may ring familiar - minor chords, muted bass, low-simmer beats - but it's all delivered rather impeccably over 15 tracks.`Summer Rainbow' fronts a from-yonder vocal loop while slowly plying the layers underneath. `Circular' shuffles static and trickling noises over an insistent beat. As can be the case, minimal tracks can easily shift to mere production exercises, and that less inspired filler (`Witty Cuts') drains momentum over seventy-plus minutes. Well done machine dance, but some judicious editing was needed to prevent eyes glazing over in a fog of ones and zeroes."
2,Disappointing.,"The Novo 3000 Premium is of very poor build quality.1 - The 2 cup filter drips at different rates for each nozzle, therefore making 2 cups of espresso simultaneously next to impossible.2 - The ESE filter holder leaks, I have only tried about six pods the leaks become more extensive with each use.Another annoyance is the used ground coffee does not empty as a hardened cake as indicated in the instruction manual, emptying the coffee after each use is a pain.This is the most disappointing item I have ever purchased from Amazon.com since 1997 so I returned it."
2,Spend a little more and get something else,"After 2 months of use, this machine started to leak. I can't find where the leaks coming from but the problem seems to be worsen everytime I use it.I always use fresh filtered water, and clean the machine after each use, so I think may be the one I got is defective... Also, the pump seems to be very poor quality. 7g of espresso tamped with about 30lb of pressure gets me about 3 drops of extraction. if I don't tamp, I hardly get crema.Overall, it was waste of money in my case. I'm shoping for another one now..."
3,Works pretty well with ESE pods,"I have not had much luck using this with real ground espresso. The usual problems, either very little espresso or none at all. A soupy mess when trying to empty the coffee. Perhaps I just don't tamp or grind very well!To that point, I've found ESE pods to work pretty well. The first pull of the morning tends to leak either a little or quite a bit. The second seems to get a better, I assume the gasket gets warm and produces a better seal.I have no idea how the straw/steamer thing is supposed to work. When I do as planned, the milk comes out too watery. However a work around is to just dunk the arm in coffee as a normal system would do. It's not quite long enough, but will work.Getting the water hot enough for steam from the brewing setting takes pretty long. Not great."
2,Good resume of what's candida and that's it,"This is a pocket book that I read in less than an hour. It resumes what is candida and leaky gut in few words and the best natural supplements to take. Information that I would have gotten easily on the internet.I know it has the word ""bible"" on the cover but half of the book is with annoying prayers which makes this book less worth reading."
5,Candida Haunting,This book was packed with so much good information of what Candida is and how to get rid of it. Very helpful to me.
1,Good for one thing,"This book is entirely incorrect. All except for the prayer part.Candidiasis requires a much more strict food plan, and also, a cleanse, and probiotics, as well as several other supplements.It requires a much more proactive method of approach.Prayer, however, is a crucial part of the healing process, which is where I find the book to be quite effective.I like the prayers in the book!So, if you need wordage for prayers, it's good.I spent more, however, on the shipping charges than the actual book itself, and I would not buy it again.Klaritee in Los Angeles"
3,hapy with purchase,"shipped on time, the book has some good healthy receipes in it but i dont think it is the best thing for one who is looking for a strick candida diet.however it is a good starting point for one who needs to clean up their diet from an overgrowth of candida"
3,The Bible Cure for Candida and Yeast Infections,"Again this was an okay book but I felt that it lacked substance and therefore, I didn't take much away after having read it. Fortunately, it wasn't very expensive."
2,not worth the money,There was nothing in this book that was any different from the other tons of info that I read online.
4,happy with the book,"This book was reasonably priced, delivered on time, and in good condition. I have not finished reading the book yet, but so far I am pleased with the quality and condition. Definitely a good purchase."
5,A Wonderful and Moving Recording,I am very pleased with this offering. The recording and performances are superb and the meditations preceding the sonatas add a great depth of understanding as they are typical of the period in which the sonatas were composed. My only criticism of the album is that the narrator of the meditations is hard to hear owing to the accoustics under which the meditations were recorded.
4,not a walk in the park,"This is an excellent book if you have at least a master'sdegree in math or a related discipline.If your eyes glaze over a page full of equations, then this isnot for you.Having said that, for the fearless that want to get a goodunderstanding of the underlying theory - it's an excellent work."
3,Web Camera,No particularly satisfied with the camera set. One of them has a clearer picture than the other one which has very poor quality. The cameras are not made for the flat screen moniters... they don't sit right and need to be secured with mounting tape.
3,"Good idea, not so good picture","I was going on a long trip and we bought these to help keep in touch. Great concept, however, these cameras aren't that great. I honestly don't have much to compare them to, but I thought the picture would be better. Cool for kids to send picture emails and very easy to use. All in all, good purchase for the price, but if you are looking for high quality video that is not so light sensitive, pay the extra cash."
1,BuddyCam Gives Logitech a Bad Name,"Before you purchase a web cam, check the list of compatible web cams each Instant Messenger recommends to use with their software. [...] Instant Messengers ARE NOT created equally. The BuddyCam had poor video quality; I don't care where you sat it or how many adjustments you made or where you placed the lighting, it looked awful. This product is for children who don't know any better and the price should be about $19.99. Installing the software might be easy provided you do a clean boot install (no running applications and to insure that you need to do ""msconfig""). [...] I realize now why my online friends always had something negative to say about their web cams and stopped using them. Thank goodness I bought another model for myself that showed me what quality is. My grandson's Buddy system will be exchanged for the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000."
3,Nothing special...,"In general, this logitech webcam works pretty well, but it might be worth upgrading to a newer, more advanced model. In the middle of a coversation, the picture sometimes gets absurdly pixelated to the point that the person you are talking to is not recognizable as a human. If you wave your hand in front of the camera, the noise usually dissipates, but it can get annoying to have to do this multiple times in each conversation. In addition, the camera sometimes does this strange thing where the image of the person you are talking to turns almost completely black, and you can barely tell that there is anyone there. In this case, you have to disconnect and reconnect the device to get it functioning again.If you are looking for a pack of cameras to casually keep in touch with someone long-distance, they certainly do work, but there are aspects of these cameras that can become quite irritating in the long run!"
1,Mr Payzant ........very little real content,"If you wish to read this book, you must first know that Mr Payzant almost pays homage to Gould and allowed Gould to change the book in his own words. As I read the book, I felt as though he was being worshipped and looked for mechanisms to the mechanics of Goulds philosophy on music as though it were a science.....we'll it was not...Gould himself never wanted to know how or Why he could play the piano as he could for fear of loosing his gift...this is we'll documented....I liken the book to a Fan who is a worshipper and not a biographer in any sense.David_Carlin@vtel.com"
5,Excellent resource!,Expand The Pie is a useful and practical book for anyone involved in any kind of negotiation. I've found it to be extremely helpful in both business and personal situations.
1,THEY ought to be ashamed,"or at least Wes Craven should be ashamed to have his name attached to this garbage. Never in my life have I seen a horror movie this bad. Not even the worst Friday the 13th could hold a flame to this movie. What's funny about this movie is that the acting and direction is decent, but the plot is not developed very well. The thin storyline that is in the movie features 4 grad students who are being haunted by something that terrorized them as youngsters. I felt soooo bad for making my friends see this with me. A large majority of the people in my theatre were sighing and yawning. I kept wondering, ""when's it gonna get good?"" The scares are cheap and scarce as well."
3,Not that bad at all...,"...but in case you wondered; This is not of the ""The Others""/""The Sixth Sence""-kind of supernatural thriller with a twist plot. This is a horror movie, but with a certain style, and not totally uninspired by the new thriller-wave like the two previous mentioned above. It's dark and quiet, and begins rather mysterious. But these are monsters, not ghosts. They're under the bed, they hide in the closet. You get the picture.""They"" is a very entertaining horror-piece, though perhaps far from being a masterpiece. I jumped in my seat several times, and recommend this movie to horror fans."
2,`They' wasn't what I expected,"I had huge expectations on this film, huge. But when it got right down to it, it just didn't cut it for me. Starts out pretty slow and once it picks up you are hooked. You're at the edge of your seat anxious about Julia's next moved wondering what's going to happen now that she knows about They then all of a sudden.....it... it.. Ends. What a disappointment that was for me to know that I just wasted my money on this movie. The suspense was pretty good I give it that but the ending not one of my favorites. Obviously these people didn't care to save their behinds because if they did they would have stocked up on a lifetime supply of flashlights and batteries or candles for that matter."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"If somehow the movie gets in your hands, the only part worth watching is the last 3 minutes."
1,If you're a horror fan you might sleep trough this,"No realy, I'm not kidding. It has happened. The movie has a very poorly depincted plot, laks almost any real horror momments and by the end you won't even know who ""They"" realy are. Exept for a somewhat tense admosphear, I haven't yet figured out why this movie is labelet as Horror"
1,boring and dumb,"This movie was a waste of time. The characters were dull and one-dimensional, the acting was bad, and the plot of the movie was nonexistent. You never actually found out what 'they' were, and both the original and alternative endings made no sense. It isn't even worth renting."
1,A MAJOR FAILURE!,"This movie by far is one of the stupidest, most uninspired, most uninteresting movies ever made. Not scary, not funny, not suspenseful, just full of crappy actors, terrible script, and a kid who (if hadn't I would of) shot himself. This should be missed at all costs. Don't even rent it or watch it on cable, becuase afterwards you just might want to commit suicide! Skip it, not worth you time, money, or even your life. There are so many other better movies out there, but then again, you can't get much worst than this piece of crud!"
1,THEy did not keep my interested = BORING,"Whats bad about this movie is that we, as viewers, know what the terror is but not the young victims. THEy are terrors of the night. So how can it keep our suspense when we already know what is happening. They should make it we are in the victims shoes, not the terror shoes, then there would be some potential. Laura Regan is the star in this movie it seems and her screams does seem ethentic and she does seem generally scared. The CGi is kinda cheesy not that i expected something better from these type of movies. I find the movie boring 1/3 of the way and feel like turning it off but i regress....and i regret. Boy did i regret....the ending is lame but wait. The DVD contains alternative ending so you get determine which ending is more lame.Do yourself a favor and skip this bloody mess."
1,They. They? They stinks like a rotten egg.,"This movie is pitifully bad. Even a cast of supporting television regulars cannot help raise this stinkfest above terrible.The title is obviously an homage to similarly named films of the late 1950's and early 60's: ""Them"", ""It"", etc. It doesn't matter. Supposedly, we're dealing here with the boogy man. Well the boogy man needs to show himself, because what we do see of him looks amazingly similar to the newly hatched alien in Aliens.Every time we're supposed to learn about the boogie man it suddenly becomes so dark we can't see anything.Really, folks - this movie is terrible! Don't bother."
4,Good Movie,"I liked this movie while two other people who I watched it with hated it. So it simply comes down to personal preference. I wouldnt say its really Scary, but come on How many horror movies really are. The acting was solid all around. The ending was kind of a letdown but again how many endings really give you what you want. I remember watching this movie in 2003 and thinking there would be a part 2 released shortly afterwards. Just don't pay attention to any negative reviews watch the movie with a open mind and theres a good chance youll like the movie for what it is. A Decent Horror Movie, not stuff of legends but pretty damn good.I recently bought and watched it again and it was good like I remembered it. I would say this is a must have for a Horror Collection and I still hope they Make a part 2."
2,"Great Potential, but left me Craven","Started out with promise. I could relate to, and liked the night terror concept, but soon found out that the movie did not have much more to offer. All the lights going out, and what's behind the glass were too cliche and predictable. The ending was something of a shocker, but it was too abrupt and left me wanting a better resolution.My biggest complaint is the lack of hope in the entire movie. You get the feeling that there is no way out for the victims, which takes away the anticipation of victory, and leaves you dissatisfied.Definitely not Craven's best: I will no longer watch a Craven movie just because of the name."
2,Rent it before you buy it...,"I would suggest renting this movie before buying it. I wasn't able to see this movie in the theater (the sound and darkness might have made the movie better/scarier) but I didn't care for the movie. If you like the ""monster-type"" movies then this is the movie for you."
2,WES CRAVEN PRESENTS A MOVIE NOT WRITTEN OR DIRECTED BY HIM.,"Well, as you know Wes Craven did not write or direct this movie and it shows. Unfortunately for him as producer he probably did put up a lot of money for this movie to be made. The acting is bad and amatuerish, the lead actress' scream in the bathroom scene with her boyfriend is so bad it almost seems as though it was part of a parody about horror movies. The story is flat and unimaginative and there is absolutely no character development. Each scene exists only to serve as a vehicle for things to make""scary noises"" and doors to ""mysteriously"" open. Telephones ring loudly after moments of silence to make you jump or to allow for the obligatory ""creepy"" phone call. This is yet another less than mediocre horror movie starring inadequate actors in their twenty somethings and a script that could have been written by a freshman in junior high. Unconvincing, unorigonal, unscary..."
2,spiders in the dark,"this movie has a lot of bad acting in it, Laura Regan for example and Jon Abrahams and that Dagmara Daminjc(whatever the hell her name is). though Marc Blucas and Ethan Embry pick this movie up its too bad Embry bits the dust in this one and the plot is too, too predictable and your sitting rooting for the spiders to kill Regan's character, but the ending is a surprise"
2,THEM.,"If this film was reworked and refitted with the 'alternate ending' on the disc I might give it three and a half stars. Great atmosphere and some decent tension elevate this spooker about THEY. However, they (the filmmakers) never really clue the viewer into who THEY (THEY) really are; except in the psuedo-clever alt. ending. Too bad really, with its decent prodution values this flick could've been a lot cooler with some script tweaking and sturdier direction. A standard issue shocker that ends up going nowhere special, THEY (the movie) is merely okay."
5,AWSOME!!,"This is a very awsome, scary and original horror film with a good plot, good acting and directing. Definately see it if you liked THE RING and DARKNESS FALLS."
2,They---are idiots,"ill admit was pretty freaky but what the heck do ""they"" want from them!!the whole movie some freaky things stock people then kill them, eat them, or give them to there young awww so kind. And a very dissipointing ending if you havent seen the movie im gona spoil it right here......she gets taken to there world for food for the babies awwwwwww!! not my movie of the freakin year.could have been better!!!!"
2,bad,"This is such a bad movie, i don't even know why i'm writing a review on it. Although it scared the hell outta me (and believe me i like scary movies), it didn't seem to have a good enough plot. The acting was poor, and who the hell are ""They""? Throughout this entire movie i was trying to figure out what it was. I thought it was something between a huge killer spider and/or a jagwar.I give ""They"" 2 stars; one for how scary it was, and another because i didn't mind watching it [BUT I DEFINITELY DO NOT WANNA WATCH IT AGAIN!!!]"
2,what a waste of money and time,"when i picked this movie up to buy it i was expecting something major .I spent a whole lot of wasted time trying to grab the concept of the movie.this is just very ,very sad and wrong!!!! ugh im done!!!"
1,What a joke,This movie should be destroyed. This is the worst horror movie I have seen in my entire life. Enough said.
3,They,"It starts out slow. When it becomes a bit interesting, the whole plot gives way to basic chase. Scenes with no depth, and why don't these people carry a flash light. Use a flash light don't blow your brains out. I've seen a lot worse. But the chases are so unorignal the creature could have been Jason."
3,"Ummm, not really","This movie borders between ingenious and really, really bad. The only difference is the way you look at it. That explains why some people really like it and others hate it. I would have to say that I could never tell what Craven was trying to do. On one hand, there is a very psychological, insightful side to the movie. The idea that a fear can be so real disorients the viewer as to what reality actually is for the characters. On the other hand, we have a movie that tries to be scary, but isn't. I would recommend renting this only if you are in the mood to watch a ""thinking"" movie. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere."
2,PLEASE EXPLAIN!,"If you know that there are creatures out there that lurk in the dark and want to kill you, why not just take up residence in the lighting department at Lowe's? Honestly, I couldn't enjoy this movie because it seemed like the characters were neglecting the most basic self-protection. Me, I'd buy a generator, candles, battery-operated lanterns, etc.Other than that, the movie is OK. The alternate ending on the DVD would also have made this a better film."
4,Not a 1 Star Movie,"A lot of people don't like this film because it doesn't answer every question. It never answers why some people were chosen, and it never gives an answer how they can truly beat the creatures from the night. This is a dark movie in atmosphere and overall story. It is about not being able to beat your demons real or otherwise. Sometimes there isn't an easy answer to beat the monster(s) like in Jason or Freddy films. I would say to give it a chance."
1,"more doldrums from the master of the obtuse, Wes Craven","I don't know what I was thinking when I got this movie. I had a chance to back out-when I saw the name ""Wes Craven,"" and remembered a number of movies bearing his namesake that nearly put me to sleep, and should have taught me a lesson.Ah, but it had been years since I last slipped up- I had forgotten the strung-together storylines, the bad acting, the predictable cuts to scene after predictable scene. The master of nightmares? Maybe one nightmare-and unintentionally so."
1,This inhales greatly!,"This [is bad] and is a big piece of [it was bad]! Don't see this, it is so dumb!"
1,"""They"" Suck",I took my little brother to see this movie when it first came out. It was a waste of time for both of us and a waste of money for me. The movie was boring and made absolutely no sense. Giving this movie a one-star rating is being too generous.This movie deserves ZERO stars.
1,Why? Undeserving of a star.,"The worst, dumbest movie I have EVER seen. And I'm a real movie buff. Don't waste your time or money."
4,the watch is excellent but the dial is little bit big,The watch is excellent but the dial is bigger than i expected other than that everything is fine but the delivery was delayed by few weeks
2,Huge!,"I bought this watch for my husband through a gold box deal. I showed him a photo of it first and then he gave me the green light. When it arrived, he wasn't 100% convinced he liked it, he said that it looked nicer on the photo... I agree with him, and I think it's more adequate for teenagers or younger men (preferably if they have large arms and hands). I guess you can't always win with these deals... ;)"
3,the watch is too large for me,the watch is relative too large for me.but the delivery and package of the watch was good. i returned it to amazon and my account was refunded in time.
4,"simple, inexpensive, no-worries watch","If purchased for what it is...a plastic watch face with a comfortable rubber band that looks and feels inexpensive...and if purchased for well under the suggested price, then this is a nice watch for going to a ballgame with the kids, doing yardwork, jean-casual events, etc. Mine showed up without an operable battery, but other than that I'm pleased with the watch for what it is...essentially an adult, large-faced Swatch."
1,In the picture....the watch is really excelent...IN THE PICTURE,"When i receive this watch, the first that i had do is connect to amazon and see the picture that i had view before. The watch is so big, so ugly, and look so cheap. I buy this watch in the gold box deals at 49 dolars, but the real price for this watch i say is around 5 o 6 dolars"
1,wufucheng,"This watch is cool,But It's biger than i imagine when i saw itand buy this one on the Amazon,"
1,Misrepresentation,The item shipped was not as shown. The description stated 14 1/2 hours on three DVDs. I was sent 2 DVDs with 172 minutes.
2,Only serviceable....,"Aside from a so-so cast, McLaughlin a stand-out as being unable to the task of Violetta, there is some really tasteless staging. Yes, the set is traditionally opulent, even fussy, but I do not need spread legs (even seen from the rear), nor a pair of unattractive breasts bouncing about. However, since this is about singing, aside from the inadequate McLaughlin is an attractive Alfredo sung by Walter MacNeil with an equally attractive but unexciting voice and the same may be said for Brent Ellis' Germont. This is not a TERRIBLE performance, but one I'll never watch again except to demonstrate to someone how Traviata should not be done. As for conductor Bernard Haitink, despite his credetials, which are considerable, if he's ever been considered a notable Verdian, I stand to be corrected."
4,Legends not Humans,"Richard Bradley hits us with a brick of facts, and when we awaken we find the truth of the last 40 years. We learned from our recent President that along with getting this job, one must lose his privacy. Mr. Bradley show us that every President must also lose their humanity. JFK the great king? The evil Richard Nixon? Wake up and smell the coffee?Richard Bradley serves it up piping hot!Every american that watches those Sunday Washington talk shows should read this book."
4,"A Useful Guide, But Short on Detail","The book is a very interesting read on an under-treated subject. If you want a concise, highly readable, brief book on the period between the rise of the Seljuks to the collapse of the Safawids, I strongly recommend it.That said, it seems odd to have such a quick survey on such a limited subject. The usefulness of a monograph is that an author can get into more detail than with a general survey, but the detail is lacking here. We have barely two pages on Toghril Beg. Alp Arslan gets three. Tamerlane gets a little over eight.Still, if the reader is willing to supplement the framework set forth here with in-depth studies of the major players, dynasties and battles, Morgan's book will have served its purpose of providing a coherent ""big picture"" view."
5,It's Iron Maiden,"What else should be said? Probably one of the best Iron Maiden albums ever. I remember when I was a teen and having the vinyl. Loved them then, love them now."
5,Young import genius,"This young man is matinee idol handsome, can sing in the ""groove' and plays a mean piano, mixing jazz, boogie, and contemporary sounds in a unique way. He should be on the tele and everywhere. David Foster, where are you when we need you?. Pick this young fellow up! Make him a star like Bublee or Groban. He is that cool. You should see him in the Ten Grands show! Shines like a new penny."
3,Not completely pop!!,"I know Leann is a country artist, and I'm not a huge country fan. But I thought I'd check this out since this was supposedly going to be an all pop album. For starters, this is not pop! The only major pop songs on here are Tic-Toc and Trouble With Goodbye. The rest of the songs are mediocre. I'm not saying they are completely bad , but they're just alright. They remind me of recent Faith Hill songs from her album ""Breathe"". Most of the time, I have to force myself to listen to them. Like another recent reviewer, I just can't get into them either. The only song I cannot stand at all is Twisted Angel. I don't really think it fits her voice!"
2,Lycea,"I wasn't too impressed with this album. For those parents out there, it might not be the best CD for your kids to listen to. The lyrics are very sensual. It's definitely not an album from the heart. There are a couple great songs on it but I don't think they're worth the purchase."
1,Blue was a good album and so was the second but what the??,"I have since 1997 had a interest in GOOD country music and Ihad found that artists like Garth Brooks and Brookes & Dunnetc etc, were very good artists, but it seems that now thatthe MONEY hungry record labels are trying to turntradtional country artists in to mega popstars.Now that this has occured with Ms Lee Ann Rimes what next?Country is country and it should stay that way and theartitst should stay true to waht gave them fame in thefirst pllace..."
5,This cd is a twisted Angel,"Ok, first off, this cd was a twist..but it was IN A GOOD WAY! great lyrics, great songs..personally her best pop album in my opinion. i will never regret buying this album. this album is a twisted angel!"
4,Underrated,"Rimes' young but productive career has been consistently mismanaged by her record company, so it's no suprise that this excellent CD fell under the public radar. Features two great recordings that should have been hit singles (""Damn"" and the fantastic ""Sign of Life""), and the two most gorgeously mature recordings of Rimes career thus-far (""Review My Kisses"" and ""Love Is An Army""). From the evidence of these four songs alone, we have a lot to look forward to from this extremely gifted vocalist."
2,I'm sorry,"I wrote a review of this album when it first came out. I gave it 5 stars then. I now have to reduce that rating to 2 stars. I'm a little conflicted. I like all of the songs on this album except for the dreadful song ""Twisted Angel."" All of the songs are great. The down side is they are not great enough for me to want to listen to them. I think I've listened to the album a total of 5 times. And most of those times I forced myself to listen to it. LeAnn is my 3rd all time favorite singer. You'd think I'd be listening to this album all day long. But I just can't get into any of these songs. They sound good. But they're just not for me. Sorry LeAnn."
5,I'm amazed,"This is a fantastic album. Leann shows she can grow and perform many styles of music. A great voice and great song selection and all done extremely well. For those narrow minded critics that give this album a poor rating simply because it is not country, or what you expected from leann, I wish you would grow up. Leann has one of the best voices around and displays it on this album but its not in her country personification. This album fits my taste more than her previous."
4,A nice introduction to Leann,"I'm not the biggest fan of country or ""new country"", but have always liked Leann's voice. I heard that this CD would be more pop than country, so I gave it a buy.I like it alot. My favorites are ""Life Goes On"", ""Tic Toc"", and ""You Made Me Find Myself"". I'm pleased with the purchase, and would recommend it wholeheartedly.I miss the clean pop of yesteryear, and although the album has some current sounding cuts on it, its basically just fun poprock, and her voice speaks for itself."
5,The Dark Heart of a Country Pop Queen,"With her new album Twisted Angel, LeAnn Rimes steps out of the shadow of her listenable but shallow earlier work. By taking a few small, brave steps out of the shadow of Nashville she is extending her ouvre beyond mere pop to something more encompassing. Take the title of the album for instance; ""Twisted Angel"". It indicates two forces are at work within LeAnn. Is she a pop singer with a heart of gold, or a more mysterious being, whose desires are not simply dissected in a shiny pop ballad. Bear in mind though, not that false dark that the purveyors of so called ""alternative"" music think is so cool. No, this is a darkness you could write to your Mom about. No faux-industrial fake angst for LeAnn. She's a country girl, and she knows how to sing about pain. Real, heartfelt despair can only be expressed in a desperate yodel, as all fans of real music know. LeAnn is an exemplary force in modern music, and this album can only increase her powers of expression."
3,"OK, but not as good as her past albums","there are basically a few good songs here- life goes on and safest place being the best, but otherwise most are just OK. I really dislike the hip-hop flavor on tic-toc and twisted angel, EWWW and some of the tracks sound so celine dion, not up to her potential. Hopefully leann will rediscover her country roots for her next album and produce the kind of music that fits her."
5,Love The Music,"After reading LeAnn's interview in BLENDER I decided to check out this CD. While not generally a fan of Country music I do like this CD alot and the way she mixes Pop with Country.What can I say more other than buy it, it's worth it, it's not one of those [bad] CD's where you buy it for one song and find out that indeed you wasted your money for just that one song cuz the rest [were bad]."
2,What Rimes with YUCK?,"Who is guiding Leann's career? Whomever it is...they are way behind on what people are wanting in music these days. It is certainly not this techno-pop laiden, britneyesque attempt at mainstream music. Other than ""Life Goes On""...I really have to say I hated this album. She should stick to music with less technical tweaking...purer instrumentals. She has a beautiful voice...but she's lost track of what made people really like her when she first hit the music scene. If I were you, I'd pass."
2,What Is She?!,"If there has ever been an artist in the last 6 or 7 years that has had an interesting time figuring out who she is and what she's going to do, it's Leann Rimes. Not only for her, but for her fans as well. She was the country darling when she first came out. She was mentioned alongside Patsy Cline and Reba McEntire and all of them. Then, something changed. Leann became part of the 'glam' music scene, and the country went straight out the window...It is not a country album..."
5,Better than Ever!,"...More than anything, ""Twisted Angel"" is a showcase of RImes's phenomenal voice, and proof that her talent extends to ANY genre. The lead-off single and first track, ""Life Goes On"" is an up-tempo dance track about letting love go after being dumped on too often. Maybe that's how LeAnn would feel after reading some of these narrowminded reviews.As always, Rimes's strength are in her ballads. Here, she delivers a soulful, adult sound that stretches her incredible range and vocal capacity. Choice cuts are ""The Safest Place,"" ""Sign of Life,"" and ""Review My Kisses."" She sings out: loud, strong, and with an emotional delivery she's never displayed before. For the first time I felt that LeAnn was singing her songs from the heart.She executive produced this album, and cowrote four of the tracks. Recommended because of great production, wonderful songs, and an uncompromised delivery by an amazing talent."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"I was very disappointed with LeAnn's new cd. I have always been a fan of her music (and that includes her pop hits) and this style just does not fit her. She tries too hard to imitate Britney Spears but Britney Spears sounds better. LeAnn has a beautiful voice but she just doesn't show it on this album. EVERY song on this album is either about her new love/sex life with her husband Dean or how strong she is now that Daddy is out of her way. Another thing, the pictures inside the cd booklet look like complete trash! I've never seen LeAnn this sleazy before. What was she thinking?! I would NOT buy this album and if I had a chance to do it over again I would have listened to it before I bought it. Sorry LeAnn, but I think you should get back to you roots and reconsider life with Daddy by your side."
2,This ain't Country folks,"While there are several songs that are OK cuts, beware! If you are looking for a new Country CD from Leann, this ain't it folks. This one is an attempt at being a rock/pop artist and while she sings and even writes some of these songs, this is not at all what I would have expected from her."
1,somebody want to tell me what the ... this is????,"Okay Story time: Let's take one more cute singer who made her way as innocent and sweet and let's turn them into the next trash. So you think just because your grown up now you can do more adult things? that megear country thing just wasnt doing it was it. This album ...!! It sounds like every other piece of proccesed canned music out there. So I guess it's more grown up to use fake instruments now. oh and cover yourself girl!! Dont stoop to all the others level. Pop music dosent need another candy girl. All the songs are beautifuly stupid. With a tinge of even more beautifully stupid Im such a woman now lyrics. buyers beware!!! Your listening to something corporate music big wigs have created her to be or maybe she created it. who cares, but your not getting anything here. z"
3,Not her best album...,"This album definitly shows Leann Rimes leaving Country music and going towards Pop. This was quite dissapointing, because I loved her I Need You album and I was hoping for another album like it. This album is not really bad, because there are some songs on it that are beautiful and that have great lyrics. Life Goes On, Wound Up, The Safest Place,and You Made Me Find Myself were wonderful. Tic Toc, Sign of Life, and Damn were quite surprising and I did not care for them all too much. This album is worth owning for Rimes fans but is not the best album in her collection."
3,I LIKED HER IN COUNTRY MUCH BETTER!,"THIS CD`S PRETTY COOL,BUT I LIKED HER COUNTRY MUSIC MUCH BETTER!I LISEND TO HER COUNTRY ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS ABOUT 3!SO LEANN,IF YOU EVER READ THIS, PLEASE GO BACK TO COUNTRY!I`M JUST A KID AND YOU WERE LIKE,MY IDOL OR SOMETHING!I ALMOST CRYED WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE TURNING TO POP!"
3,Hugely Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this CD. LeAnn Rimes seems so hard to be the hot pop artist that she is losing what has made her better than so many. There is nothing ""wrong"" with this collection; you will enjoy it if you like the genre--LeAnn does a great job of what she sets out to. But instead of trying to be the next Brittany or Mariah. . .why not try to be true to your calling, LeAnn, and knock everybody off their feet with the same unique artistry that blew everyone away in your early teens?"
1,DISSAPOINTED,"I HAVE BEEN USING ""SHINE PLUS"" FOR TEN YEARS OR SO. THIS MOST RECENT PURCHASE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT BECAUSE THE FORMULA HAS BEEN CHANGED. SHINE PLUS HAD A LIGHT PLEASANT FRAGRANCE, AND ITS OVERALL PERFORMANCE WAS FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER PRODUCT (I SHOULD MENTION I HAVE USED REDKEN AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS FOR YEARS AS A PROFESSIONAL IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY.)I ANTICIPATED THE PRODUCT TO BE CONSISTANT TO WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST....BUT....THE FRAGRANCE IS SO OVERPOWERING THAT I HAVE TO ""BRACE"" MYSELF, HOLD MY BREATH, AND RINSE IT OUT AS QUICKLY AS I CAN. IT IS TRULY OVERWHELMING AND DEFINATLY A CHANGE IN THE FORMULA...BAD BAD...BAD!"
2,"Does give shine, but that's about it","This product will leave your hair very shiny, which is nice, but it does nothing to help style your hair. Not that impressed."
4,Mom cried,Very touching poem. Mom cried her eyes out. I would recommend for to a friend for Mother's day. Quality was decent.
5,Transitions--music to relax by,"This CD offers music for many moods. Frank Mills is well known for his ""Music Box Dancer"", a catchy tune, not found on this disk. I especially enjoy ""Heart of the City"", and ""Island Hopping"". Each piece is very individual...You don't get bored listening to this CD."
4,Whole foods,This book is a great text on alternative nutrition and whole foods. It makes clear the importance of proper nutrition on human health. This is not your mainstream nutrition guide its far more.
3,Rare footage of Hironori Otsuka,"This second volume of ""Wado Ryu Karate"" by TSUNAMI Productions continues in the tradition of the first... an interesting high level overview of Wado style karate by Yoshiaki Ajari with old (1965-ish) film footage of Hironori Otsuka, the founder of Wado-ryu karate. There are demonstrations of kata Chinto, Niseishi, Rohai, Wanshu and Jitte. There are also discussions of the Wado versions of the concepts of Inasu, Noru and Nagasu with bunkai-oyo. It was an interesting comparison tape -- after I turned down the audio and ignored the funky narration."
2,Makes No Sense At All!,"Four songs from two great singles I bought back in the day and still cherish. The live take of ""Masochism World"" isn't really essential, but that overdriven tear through ""Eight Miles High"" is pure genius, and ""Makes No Sense At All"" b/w ""Love Is All Around"" is Husker Du at their most gloriously pop-influenced. This EP would be a great buy at $3.98 or $4.98, but charging the same price for this that you'd pay for FLIP YOUR WIG, NEW DAY RISING or ZAN ARCADE (the latter a double LP!) is nothing short of ridiculous. Inspiring music, but at this price it's poor value for the money."
4,Simply the most amazing vocal...,"The cover of Eight Miles High is a MUST for any Husker Du, Bob Mould or fan of rock that you didn't hear on the radio in the 80's. Mould's vocal is so strained with emotion that I'm not sure, even after listening to it for many years, whether it's conveying his pain or pleasure. It's simply amazing. Just thinking about overwhelms me with nostalgia for the mosh pits, goth chicks and the after hours club dancing of my mis-spent punk rock youth. I like the other songs too, but seriously, I hardly ever play them. When I need an electrifying jolt of pure emotion, I just slap this on my CD player and hit 'repeat 1'..."
5,Whispers In the Night - Couldn't Put it Down,"This is the third book of Robert Hecker's that I have read. If you didn't believe in the paranormal before reading Whispers in the Night, you probably do now. The journey of his central character (Sandi) and her professor while she seeks to find out if the voices in her dreams are real and if she is the reincarnation of a person from Naza Germany, or is she just going crazy, will take you on a roller coaster ride. This book is not to be missed."
2,Not a Great Sounding Concert: Mixing and Playing Lack,"I, like many who purchased this DVD, am a long time fan of this talented duo. Seeing them live in the 80's solidified my appreciation for their music and ability to perform. Then, last year I attended a show in California (2nd row center) and was very disappointed. Hoping I caught them on a bad night, I picked-up this DVD. Unfortunately, it is no different.First, the performance. At best, a parody of themselves. Not far from tribute band quality. Then there's the music quality. The back-up musicians were forgettable and sounded as though they needed more practice to be cohesive and worthy of playing in front of paying audiences (see any Eagles DVD for the opposite). The mixing and audio quality itself is, as others have noted, amateur.If you want to remain a Heart fan - skip this and cling to their old recordings and your fond memories of a great band."
5,"This is a ""MUST HAVE"" DVD","I was an average fan of Heart (at the most) prior to seeing this DVD, but, this is one of the best produced Rock N Roll DVDs on the market. Their version of Black Dog blows away Zeppelin's just released (May 2003) version. I played both Zeppelin and Heart's version of Black Dog for several friends - and all agreed that Heart's version was the best. All of the songs are excellent and far superior to the conventional studio mix. The video is excellent, too. Check out the credits: they play Barricuda at a sound check with almost no singing - it sounds great. My review is based on a DTS surround sound system. This is a ""must have"" DVD!"
5,A standout,"Excellent video with great vocals, this blu-ray stands out. I especially love ""THESE DREAMS"" and ""ALONE"". Out of all the Heart blu-rays I own, this is the best one. Both Wilson sisters shine, with excellent vocals and instrumentation."
5,"Excellent Performance, Audio and Video!","Heart is on my top 10 list of groups so this not an 'unbiased' review... I think this is a very good show. Sometimes bands start their shows with less known / popular songs but that isn't the case here (Crazy on You is the opening song...). Both the audio and video are very crisp. If you like Heart, I highly recommend it."
4,Pretty darn good,"Yes the Wilson sisters still have it. Great vocals and playing. The blu ray is pretty crisp and the sound is solid, a definate must buy for any fan of Heart."
5,What a concert!!,I attended this concert just after returning to the US (the tickets were a gift) and it was one of the best I ever saw. This DVD captures the brilliance of the Wilson sisters. They haven't lost a thing! A must see for Heart fans.
1,Very Poor Audio Quality,"I am a Heart fan from way back in the early 70's, albums, cd's, concert's, etc . Out of my entire collection I think this DVD has the lowest quality audio of Anne that I have ever heard. All you hear is a lot of echo. I can live with 5.0 surround but the echo is so bad that I just previewed the DVD and could not play it completely. Who ever mixed this soundtrack has no idea what he is doing. Anne's voice is Heart. I recommend you do not buy this DVD until it is re-mixed. What a shame that such a great group's first DVD has such poor sound quality."
1,"Heart does not ""heart"" the Xbox 360 HD-DVD player","Not sure if this is a fair review of this HD-DVD or merely a reflection on my player, but just like David L. below, I had the same issue while trying to play this disc on my Xbox 360 HD-DVD player. Just like he said, it doesn't want to load past the production co. logo. If you wait long enough, it loaded the title screen for me, but trying to navigate through the menu resulted in an action not supported message and trying to hit play resulted in a lengthly pause followed by a return to the FBI warning screen and that same prod. co. logo and eventually the title screen again. The only other issue I've had with an HD-DVD on my X360 player was with Superman Returns, which was related to a well-known freeze-up problem in some copies, and after an exchange from the store, I got one that worked fine. Maybe the same is true for this one as well. Frustrating when I was looking forward to a great live show, but no delivery. . ."
4,very good show,"If your a heart fan and you have blu ray. go ahead and get this, you won't be dissapointed."
1,Dead on Arrival,"This is a HD DVD, although not so stated on Amazon. It would not play on either of my DVD drives, and is the only DVD that will not play.Peter Morgan"
3,12-22-06 Wont play on Xbox 360 HD DVD drive,This disk as well as the Chicago disk will not play on the Microsoft Xbox 360 HD DVD drive at this time. (12-22-06) I hear that they are working on a patch.
2,boring,"i love heart, good studio music over the years, and was hoping it would translate to a good live show, but i can't say it did. show was at what seemed a small venue in seattle, and the show had a feel of a low budget affair. was not a lot of energy in the band's show. gave it 2 stars because of their inclusion of a couple covers from zeppelin."
4,GREAT CONCERT!,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD FOR MY WIFE, WHO'S BEEN A HEART FAN FOREVER. TURNS OUT THAT I LIKE IT AS MUCH AS SHE DOES. I FORGOT WHAT A GREAT SINGER ANN WILSON WAS AND IS. THE VOCALS ARE GREAT, VERY BALLZY AND THE BAND IS VERY TIGHT. THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD AND THE CONCERT ISN'T INTERUPTED WITH INTERVIEWS. THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME WERE MISTRAL WIND, LOVE ALIVE AND TWO FACES OF EVE. FOUR NEW SONGS ARE PLAYED AND THEY ROCK LIKE CLASSIC HEART.THE ONLY BAD POINTS: A LITTLE TOO MUCH AUDIENCE NOISE DURING SOME SONGS. ALSO, WITH ALL THE BIG HITS THAT HEART HAD, THEY PLAY TWO LED ZEPPLIN SONGS AND AN ELTON JOHN SONG. THEY DO THESE SONGS VERY WELL, BUT THIS ISN'T A REAL LONG CONCERT AND IT IS A HEART CONCERT. STILL WELL WORTH THE MONEY."
4,"pardon the pun, but they've got alot of heart...","It's great to be watching a proper Heart show. When they went the ""wall of synths"" route in the 80's, I was only mildly interested & figured my days with Ann & Nancy were about numbered. Then, many years later, along comes this DVD...and I must say, it's a helluva performance. Classic songs, new songs, re-worked songs (""These Dreams"" and ""Alone"" are stripped-down, and sound so much better than the overproduced 80's versions IMO), and a few covers thrown in for good measure (including a sweet version of ""Black Dog""...Ann's vocals hit ""the zone"" here). My only two gripes: the editing is occasionally weak, and the lack of special features was kinda disappointing. But the sound & picture is crisp, the performance is hot, and it's a great way to kick back an evening... here's hoping for a live release from the Jupiters Darling tour as well..."
2,"Great Sound, No Substance","Much of contemporary music (by composers who are still active) have little going for it other than individuality. Salonen knows how to work the orchestra and he produces some astonishing sounds. The music is indeed original, even if does on occasion sound a little like Rautavaara. But the Variations seem disjointed with one dazzling episode following another with any sense of continuity or cogency. It seems that the Variations would be just as effective if it were ordered randomly. The music isn't academic, but one comes away with the impression that the work could be a series of unrelated examples from an advanced orchestration textbook. Ultimately the music is highly individual, but unmemorable. Great performances though."
1,more new sounding music,"This is more new music by a mediocre conductor and composer. Lucky to have employment in america, probably most likely because of his foreign lineage.Salonene shows that he has, by studying others techniques, the ability to write music; but what is his point?The playing on this cd is very good, but the lack of expression and color is sad, and hopefully he will just get better with time."
5,You WONT believe your ears!,"Buy this, as you won't believe your ears. This man is fantastic. I first heard him over 20 years ago, but never forgot about his talent. As being a person who used to travel to school by steam train several times a year, to hear Wes Harrison do his thing, well, I can close my eyes, and he takes me back in time.Buy it, you will not be disappointed."
4,Wes Harrison - Classic Comedy,For those of you that would like something more that oneliner standup comedy. Have a listen to somethingthats sure to bring a smile and a laugh. Wes Harrison artfully intergrates storytelling with full sound effects(created with just his mouth and a microphone). This timeless comedy should be enjoyed by all ages.
3,about what I expected,Not much information in the ad but it was about what I thought it would be It'll be fin in my tumbler
2,The Magic Show with none of the Charm,"I saw the show on Broadway twice, once wtih the original cast and again later. This is not a movie of that show. I saw this on video several years ago and it's dratically different from the play/musical. Lion Tamer and Charmen's Lamentand the Goldfarb Vairations are gone (the best numbers in the show) and several illusions have been replaced wiht stuff from Doug's specials, to the detriment of the production. IT shows off some good magic, and tells the same basic story, but if you're looking at a bit of history of the original show, you are going to be disappointed."
1,pretty bad,"I thought this would be interesting, with some good magic by Doug Henning, but it turns out to be rather boring. Couldn't get myself to watch it straight through without using fast-forward."
1,Run...Run Screaming...Run Screaming far from this DVD,"If you are getting this DVD because you have great memories of the Broadway Show, adored the score, and have generally been waiting for this to turn up, please, please save your money.West End Avenue is missing, the Goldfarb Variations are missing, Charmin's Lament has been changed beyond any recognition.The actor playing Van Syskind is adequate, I guess. Didi Conn (who I love, btw) is fine. Anita Morris is great, but has been hamstrung by the changes to her character. Doug, well, what can I say, Doug was a great magician and it's wonderful to see him perform.And, **perhaps**, if that's all you're looking for..great magic and the one (Lion Tamer) or two (Up to His Old Tricks (although the arrangement is not as good)) hummable songs they've allowed to remain, then maybe you won't be stunningly disappointed that you spent money on this disc."
2,"Nice Magic, but...","I saw this show in previews at the Cort Theatre in New York. It was never a great show, but had three things going for it: Doug Henning, a terrific supporting cast and some great songs by Stephen Schwartz. On this DVD all you get is Doug Henning. Three of the best numbers (Goldberg variations, West End Avenue and Solid Silver Platform Shoes) are missing or replaced. Didi Conn, who is a lovely comedic actress cannot sing Lion Tamer, which may explain why they dropped West End Avenue. The rest of the cast is fair. I'm glad I bought this for the memories, but I wish it had more of what I remember on it."
1,Faint Carbon,"This is not really the MAGIC SHOW that had a long run on Broadway. Many of the songs have been changed, and while the new ones are pleasant enough, none is as sophisticated or interesting as the one it replaced.To me, the biggest problem are the sets and costumes. So ugly, so cheap looking.As the divine assistant, the late Anita Morris is great. Didi Conn is fun and adorable, though vocally thin."
3,This could have been so good.....,"Michael Mosher (another reviewer) knew what he was talking about when discussing this dvd. I remember parts of this show vividly from seeing it when I was a teenager (many years ago now!). The show on this dvd is very, very different. Four of the songs (Solid Silver Platform Shoes, West End Avenue, Charmin's Lament and The Goldfarb Variations) have all been replaced with new, inferior songs. It's a shame. The performances are terrific from a very talented cast, and of course the magic tricks are just amazing - if only it was the original show! If you have happy memories of the original ""Magic Show"", then don't buy this dvd. You will be disappointed if you do!"
2,so so,"I had high hopes for this since I love June Storey. Ever since I saw her adorable performance in ""In Old Chicago"", I've been a fan. This was one of the few ventures outside of the Gene Autry territory for her. It's too bad it's mediocre.June Storey and Neil Hamilton play married detectives a la Thin Man but they don't have the chemistry that William Powell and Myrna Loy supplied. The plot concerns them proving Evelyn Brent's innocent of murder. It's kind hard to follow. Even with only being a hour long this movie dragged. Film quality also left much to be desired.I hope her movie Dance Hall with Carole Landis gets released one day."
4,Wonderful,"I was quiet wary about reading this book because it was the first Nora Roberts book that i would have read, however once I started reading I couldn't stop. It was a great book with the romance of the four sisters and the underline story about their great grandmother and her mysterious romance and the Calhoun Necklace."
4,Great Read,"This is a great read, however, not worth while unless both books are read: Catherine & Amanda, and Lilah & Suzannah"
5,I loved this book and i have read it several times!!!!!,"It is a great story,and i just couldn`t stop reading it"
4,Calhoun Women-read in chronological order,"If you've chosen this book then you're already a romance novel reader. It's not the typical extreme romance mush but it is close. Be sure to read these in the appropriate order. 1st-Catherine & Amanda then 2nd- Lilah & Suzanna. The reviews i read didn't specify but I checked. It flows and is quite engrossing. I easily got caught up in the characters but the overall premise of 4 sisters all falling fast & head over heels in love in a short period is somewhat unbelievable (but i guess that's why we read romance in the first place). I don't want to say more so as not to ruin the book. My original ""Roberts"" book was ""Montana Sky"" which has been the best by far after reading 5 of hers. I like story lines that are a bit more realistic than this series. Hope this helps more than the ones I read."
4,Typical Romance but Wonderful Nora Roberts,"This is a collection of two stories. Both are very good in typical Nora Roberts fashion.However, because both of these stories are shorter than the normal Nora Roberts books, the characters tend to fall in love faster and it is much less realistic than her longer stories.The added drama of a missing jewels is what ties these two stories (and the others in this series) together.In the first story- C.C. and Trent are fun to read about. They are opposites and prove that love can conquer all. The second story about Amanda and Sloan I found very enjoyable because of their constant sniping at each other.As an added note, it is best to read these and all of the Calhoun Women books in order."
3,Reprint of a good series start.,"Comprised of two books previously published: COURTING CATHERINE and A MAN FOR AMANDA. Roberts begins a quartet of romances about the Calhoun sisters, tying the books together with an ill-fated romance from the past and a missing necklace to find. COURTING CATHERINE had the type of heroine I must enjoy and rarely see: a woman who works with her hands, feisty and sure of her own self-worth."
5,mind blowing,all i can say about this album is WOW every song on this album is great not to mention the movie so go on and cop it you can't lose
5,don't put away this childish thing,"Another great collection from one of the best music has to offer. James has more bite than usual, and it's welcome. Beside the scathing ""We Can't Make it Here Anymore"" featured tracks are ""Memorial Day"" ""Slewfoot"" and the haunting ""Holiday"". Support this guy- let's hope he keeps touring and cranking out amazing music."
3,"Sorry, this doesn't measure up","I was looking forward to this record, but its not as good as previous ones, particularly, ""Where'd you Hide the Body"". Lyrically, in particular, this one is a lesser effort."
5,Still the Southwestern Boss,"James McMurtry comes through again with a musical snapshot of the southwest. While the tone and style of the music itself may be somewhat predictable, (although pleasently so), his lyrics are worthy of print. McMurtry manages to distill issues into distinct stories, sometimes amusing, (""Slew Foot""), sometimes heartbreakingly poignant, (""Holiday""). Listening to this CD is like looking through a scrapbook of the lives of people who work for a living, who struggle to make it in a hard part of the country and who manage to maintain hope and grace while doing so.McMurtry is one artist who consistently makes first class music. No bad tracks, no mistakes, and no disapointments. I highly recommend this CD to any fans, as well as to anyone who appreciates smart, literate, and on point artists."
3,Solid album but probably not the best introduction to Mcmurty's work.,"This is a good album with the two strongest songs being the first and last. I probably would give this 4 stars if I was not addicted to the 'Live in Aught 3' which could be one of the best 3 live albums ever. I think it would be a better intro to McMurtry's music and his great live sound. This album is dark but it needs to be to tell the stories he brings. Although this is not my favorite of his work, it is easily worth the money to hear how a real songwriter crafts his vision. Memorial Day is a really solid strong, as well as Holiday (not quite as lighthearted as REK's Merry Christmas from the Family), but the real gem is 'We Can't make it Here'. Buy this album, McMurty's work is just as relevant as Springsteen or Steve Earl with the humor and wordsmithing of Robert Earl Keen."
4,Wonderful surprise,"Wonderful surprise. I bought this CD based on one song I heard on the radio, ususally a mistake. I am thoroughly enjoying the whole CD. I will definitly buy more."
4,Give it a try,"A weird wonderful mixture of Bruce, Warren Zevon and Robert Earl Keen. His lyrics make you want to hurry up & learn the words so you can sing along. A most enjoyable CD."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I own the entire McMurtry catalogue...but this much anticipated album left me somewhat disappointed. I mean, overall, the best description for this album is ""blah"". Sometimes the lyrics are just offensive (Childish Things) and at other times the lyrics and phrasing of those lyrics are just ripped off from legendary artists. The line ""Some folks say he looks a lot like me"" and the phrasing of that line from ""Old Slew Foot"", are stolen directly from the song ""Long Black Veil"" by Johnny Cash. That's the kind of thing that makes me lose some respect for McMurtry. That...and the fact that he seems to have a little Dixie Chick in him. I mean, I've always liked McMurtry's music...but if he continues putting out this mediocre stuff and trying to shove his laughable views on me...well, I can spend my money elsewhere."
1,About 20 years too late!,"While musically James McMurtry has talent, the message of his album and especially the hit song ""We Can't Make It Here"" is outdated and unrealistic. In the song McMurtry laments about shirts being made in Singapore and the problems of outsourcing jobs, among other ridiculous things. It seems he would like to live in the world of the 1950s. While appealing on the surface, it is a waste of time to think like this.McMurtry should realize that oursourcing is a reality and American companies have no choice. Nor is this a new issue. Shirts being made in Singapore? Give me a break -- he should find a real cause to wail against, not one that was lost years ago."
1,Defective,"Item worked well for about a week, then started disconnecting itself constantly. I finally gave up and bought a different brand."
2,"Promising, but rarely works.","Within 2 months of owning this mouse, it started acting up. Changing surfaces seemed to help for a while, but now this mouse is practically unusable. The cursor jumps all over the place, and even moves when the mouse is not being actively used."
5,Perhaps the best Rossini DVD available,"L'Italiana in Algeri is Rossini at his very best. First performed in Venice in 1813 when Rossini was but 21 years old, this most enchanting opera buffa soon took Europe by storm. Arthaus offers a production conducted by Ralf Weikert that captures magnificently the hilarity and madness of Rossini's first comic masterpiece. The singers and orchestra are magnificent, as are the costumes, sets and props--the live monkey adds a most comical touch! Watching the act 1 finale alone is worth the price of this DVD. Without doubt this would be a terrific first opera for the opera curioius, especially for anyone thinking that opera is always tragic and deadly serious. This production is a real treat, and only gets better with repeated viewings. A bubbling performance all around!"
3,"A good visual material, not a musical one","This is a good video if you are expecting for a visual, scenic and theatrical show. Colours, costumes and scens. They do a really ""folie organisée"" (organized madness) whose Stendhal spoke. Humor, just humor you can find in this, I repeat, coloured video. But, there is two exceptions: Nucia Focile and Doris Soffel, they do a great work, better than versions like Valentini- Terrani's."
2,YUK!,"When I received the book, I thought wow. It is a glossy, hard cover (sort of) paperback. It looked so promising. However, when I went to read the book I was flustered. The author writes in sentences and word combinations that to me spell ""I don't know what I'm talking about so I'll use these sentence structures so I look good"".Beyond this, I tried to understand his work. He had no concrete authority for some of his thoughts. I do not think you can just espouse a theory without providing hooks to help it stand up to argument. Really it is just a book of opinions written in gobbldy gook.I do not recommend you buy this book or this author.Jimmy"
3,Really A Great Addition to Female Revenge Genre !,"This Bennie Woodell as a director,writer ...so on and so forth can make a movie with nothing into something.He also made Fast Zombies With Guns,See our review of it elsewhere.D.A.D. is pretty incredible with nice death scenes and chases and acting that is NOT wooden or amatuerish.The lead,Leena Kurishingal , Is pretty and amazing,She shows emotion,physicality in action scenes and just has a look that smacks of a star.With all the women as weapons films,This one has to have earned a spot no matter it's budget and those that maybe consider STUDIO ""A"" films.Filmed near Chicago,It has a much grittier look with rain and bad weather obvious to filming."
3,Very Strong Perfume Scent,"I did not read anything about the scent before purchasing and as some might like the scent it is very very strong so if you don't this product will be a waste for you. The scent has a strong floral aroma. The texture is thin so it glides on well, nice for a daytime moisturizer. Would not recommend it for anyone who has sensitivities to aromas, as it is over powering."
2,Poorly Made,"Immediately upon assembly, we found this product to be poorly made. The mesh above the lamp was so poorly designed that it could not be reapplied after the bulb was inserted. It stands askew because poor alignment of the gold dividers in the shaft. Although it serves its basic function of providing light, it was not worth $28."
2,This is the same as the American Standard lamp,"Please see my review for the American Standard hallogen lamp, because that is what will be shipped to you. I have bought several of these exact lamps from OSH for a much cheaper price and they have all died on me just after the warranty expired. The lamp is very pretty and provides a lot of light, but the quality is just awful. I am not even going to open the box, I'm sending this thing back."
2,"Pretty, gets the job done, but cheap","The light turns off by itself and if we apply pressure to the base - theeeen it goes back on...Not the nicest of lamps but I wanted a stand alone lamp that could fade in and out - I just wanted to be the one to control it (not the weight of my shoes that need to stay on the base).Could've merely gotten a ""bad"" one or missed a step in putting it together. But as I see in the other reviews - others had some of the same issues so maybe it wasn't me after all..."
2,Good for a rent,"This game loses its magic after a few hours. The tekken series puts this to shame. It is worth one rent, and thats it."
5,sc2,"having played the soul calibur series since psx <soul edge> then the one for dreamcast <soul calibur> and also a large fan of the other fighting games, this is by far the best out there. great graphics, the load times are a bit lengthy compared to xbox and game cube, but its still a great and challanging game none the less. the only thing i would change is the controller, im not fond of the ps2 controller, mind you its better hten the gamecube one but the xbox controller s is superior to ps2's. if you can find a converter i would suggest it, but the ps2 controller is still good, espically for the people who have played many fighting games for ps2 already. over all its great game, beautiful graphics, and great fighting style."
5,The best of the best,"If you like fighting games this is it. They have great characters, great story line, great grapics, and of course great fights. You can't ignore this game. The only possible down side is that school's starting up."
1,Rehash,...i played SC on Dreamcast. It Abousluty Fantastic. ive played the new Soul Calibur its Ultimatly the same only with pretty graphics and some new characters. Not to metion the silly idea of putting unique characters on each system. Gimmick? I'd Say so. unless uve never played the Original SC...
4,Soul Calibur 2-GB review,"""Soul Calibur 2""....True, true. This game is far superior to other games such as ""Bloody Roar"" in terms of graphics, and to many, storyline. But I like Bloody Roar better for it's definite theme. Soul Calibur has no theme but to mix everyone's together. The ending stories are either melencholy or uneventful. The ""Weapon Master"" mode is long and unfulfilling. I like Soul Calibur 2....but I'm not playing it over and over again. After a few times through story mode everything is so boring and POINTLESS."
5,Greatest fighting game out there!,"This game is by far the best out there. You may buy/sell/trade your other fighting games over time, but this is certainly one that you should always keep! If you've never played it before, you must get it!"
3,Good Game,"This is a good game but i dont think its as good as the original. There is someting anooying about this game, they didnt make the stages as beautiful as in the original for Dreamcast. The graphics are really good, and the game play is very challenging. I was addicted to this game, but I reccommend you rent this before you buy it."
4,This game rocks!!!!!!!!,"This game is awesome. Okay you can play up to 15 characters, including yoshimitsu, Lizardman, Ivy, and more. You can go through arcade mode, weapon masters, and other game modes suck as practice. You can train your favorite character to learn new moves. I'm telling you now anyone who likes fighting games should get Soul Calibur 2!"
4,Possibly the most ADDICTIVE ARCADE GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was waiting for this game for a long time.Whenever I went to the arcade, I'd spend most of my quarters on this game. It's a lot like Tekken because the gameplay is similar. Each version (PS2 GameCube or Xbox) has a special character. PS2 has Hehachi from Tekken, GameCube has Link from The legend of Zelda, and Xbox has Spawn. (I don't know what game Spawn is from). So anyway, It's an awesome game!!!!!!!!!!"
5,only thing keep the ps2 on the top,"xbox have helo... game cube's supersmash bro.... finally ps2 come up with something can match up with the other. Soulcalibur have almost perfect graphic. You only can c a lil flaw unless u move the screen really really close to the chararcter. Alot weapon to select. almost all character are even, (except nerid i think, cuz is way too fast and too strong.). and guard impact is new and awsome to the fighting game."
4,Best fighting game,This game is awesome.Move over Mortal Kombat. Not only can you fight your friends but it has a story mode too. On the Gamecube Version you can play as Link from Zelda. You can make your enemy fly over a cliff. You have weapons all the time and basically kill enemys. I've played at a arcade. Nightmare is my favorite. My other information came from Extended Play. On Tech Tv(75)on cable.On at 3:00 every weekday.
4,This is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is da best. Graphics and all. Any one who played this game would love it.
5,Soul Calibur II lives up to it's rep,If you loved the 1st one you'll love the second one. Great 3-D action and better choices for battlefields. You won't be disappointed.
1,didnt last 1 wash,I have used patches before and had no issues. The first wash with this patch it is already peeling off. Unless you plan on sewing these in don't buy it. IT DOESN'T STICK PAST THE INITIAL IRONING.
1,got the order wrong (twice),This order was filled wrong twice. I had requested this larger 8x10 size for patching. Twice I recieved the small jiblets --- roughly the size of a business card. This in spite of 8x10 being clearly shown on the order. Sheeesh !!!
5,Learning Esperanto is easy for anyone with this book!,"With nothing else to work with, I bought this book and started my studies of this wonderful language. The lessons are easy to read and the vocabulary is eloquently interjected to make remembering easy. With this book, one can pick it up at any time and just read for five minutes. This book also includes questions at the end of each section to quiz you on what you've learned. It's amazing at how you work up a good vocabulary base so quickly. A definate yes if you're trying to learn Esperanto. Even good for younger readers (I'm sixteen and love it!)."
2,Beginners' Esperanto by J.F.Conroy,"Even though the author may be well versed in this language he is too technical with grammar in the beginning. Reader gets overwhelmed with all the points of grammar. Way too much to absorb at the start. Seems like he wants to IMPRESS the readerwith his knowledge instead of presenting the material in an easy as possible way to absorb it, put it to practical use. He makes my head ""swim"" in trying to put it all together ""right off the bat"". Also the word lists are ""disjointed"". Got to flip backand forth too much to find them, etc."
5,Buffalo Republic,"I was brousing a gift shop in Apgar Village in Glacier National Park last weekend with some familiar, yet different ballads in the background. I was searching the scattered CD's on the display cabinets for whom I was certain was Gordon Lightfoot singing a ballad I was not familiar with.The shop owner told me that I was looking right at the album being played, that by Jack Gladstone. Not sure where I have been all these years in Montana, but this Montana-Native American balladier has impact, relevent lyrics, harmony and super backups. It becomes even better when one reads along the words that are supplied in the case. While the ""white man"" is not entirely guilty in their march to the West, there is much cause for thought in Gladstone's gentle points. And, if you are not politically or historically inclined, the entire production is pleasing to the ear.A chance buy that I'm very glad I made. Highly recommended."
3,no fragrance but has color dyes.,"I did not realize when a product was fragrance free they would still put dye in it. Most of us that are allergic to one are also allergic to the other. I thought the blue color was the bottle, not the product - I had never seen blue shampoo before. It's nice enough on the hair but makes my scalp itch from the dye."
3,Spotty But Worth It,"Not their best, but this is still worth owning. Lots of style variation compared with most of their other albums. Walk Like A River is a standout. Relapse, Recover a nice psych trip. You should own every Leaving Trains album so get it."
2,TOO SLIPPERY,"This product is not suitable for active children who are running or climbing on smooth floors, playground equipment etc. There are two patches of fabric on the bottom of the shoes which make them extremely slippery. We were unable to use them at all on playground equipment since they caused our child to slip and fall. They ended up sitting in the drawer because they were too dangerous to use. Had we known that the bottoms are not not non-slip we would not have purchased them."
2,Specs?,"It would be marvelous if this expensive had some specs. Like - what is the power source! No power cord is shown and no batteries?Sloppy sloppy sloppy doesnt make for good sales.I would think the manufacturers would want to protect their products with a bit of attention.Actually, I find some few of the products here on Amazon are very poorly described. I hope that no one is surprised when sales are low."
3,Not what I expected but...,"The biggest disappointment was the fabric wasn't really what I had expected, the fit at the rear window area doesn't fit all that tight (I have a 06 Mustang convertible).The cover will work but I wouldn't order it again, you might be happy with one but I'm just o.k with it.The question is why didn't I return it, the simple answer is, it is what it is and I should have done my home work better....not the fault of the company."
5,love my red pumps!,I really love these. They are cute and comfortable. I love wearing them with jeans.
1,pathetic sound quality,"I have not used this phone for SKYPE yet, but as a land line phone it is pratically worthless. The sound quality is so bad you can't understand what the person on the other end is saying. Do not buy this phone, at least not if you ever wanted to use it as a land line phone."
2,Almost made it,"The dual phone-land line and Skype- does work...almost. The audio/voice quality is poor. The volume will sometimes be too loud, then moving the volume down, makes it too quiet...sometimes, almost like if the caller's voice volume does not trip the VOX type circuit, it won't amplify the sound so it is either loud or you can't hear...weird...this is on both handsets. The audio is also raspy and not clear. The size is almost too small. My wife puts it to her ear and covers up the ear piece sound exit and can't hear...I found the interface with the computer, though easy, did not do what I thought it should. I expected that when going from computer to the Skype phone, that the speaker and microphone on the phone would work. They only work if you set the Skype defaults on the computer to be ""USB Device""...hmmm maybe this is problem with Skype. dunno, no response from GE Thomson. With both of these problems...it will be going back."
5,Great Reception,"After downloadging and installing the latest version of the phone's software, this phone has been a great joy to work with. It is a great phone! great speaker quality. I spent ~ 10 hours a week on conference calls from people all over the world, including COlombia, Buenos Aires and Eupore. The combination of this phone with Skype's great network quality has really improving our business's internal communications."
3,Skype feature is worth the money,"This phone's success with Skype is largely dependent on you PC's internet speed. High-speed cable or DSL is preferable for best quality. I use it all day, everyday and it is a great alternative to traditional landlines or cell phones in the home or office. I would like a better menu system, but for making phone calls, I can't complain."
5,Great phone,This is a great phone in both design and performance. The sound quality is normal. I love it so far and recommend it.
2,GE 2 in 1 Skype Phone,"I purchased this product with the intention of accomplishing two goals, leveraging on my existing land line and investigating the option of using Skype. After using the product for about a month, I have found the phone to be rather annoying. Sound quality is less than anticipated and Skype requires the PC to be up at all times. Hence, it was more of a hassle keeping my PC up to use Skype than it was just falling back to my land line. Skype seems to be a great service yet my land line is actually cheaper. What is good about the phone is it gives you the ability to switch between Skype and a land line service rather easily."
2,"Nice idea, but falls short","On the plus side - The price is OK as it has come down quite a bit since the earlier reviews. It was very easy to install and set up. It works well for Skype and Skype Out calls.On the downside - As other reviewers note, the landline sound quality is poor. It does not import names for Skype Out contacts. Cannot enter Skype Out contacts into handset memory. Skype feature does not load once pc hibernates; system must be rebooted.To summarize, it sort of works, but there are enough shortcomings that I would not recommend buying this.I'm debating whether or not to return it...maybe I'll keep it for a while and then sell it on eBay??"
3,Good for skype only,"Portugues: Comprei o aparelho com a intencao de direcionar todas as ligacoes internacionais para o Skype. Com a opcao de deixar um aparelho disponivel em casa, segui a recomendacao deste produto.No entanto, as ligacoes com o Skype ficaram boas apenas quando foram para o Canada e para os EUA. Ja as ligacoes para o Chile estavam sempre atrasadas, o som pessimo, optando por realiza-las direto do computador, sem o intermedio do telefone. Ademais, apos uns 20-30 minutos, o telefone parava de funcionar, sendo necessario ligar diretamente do laptop.Ademais, com as ligacoes locais torna-se quase impossivel ouvir o que a outra pessoa fala, nao podendo subistituir todos os aparelhos da casa, por este da GE.Quando instalado no laptop, a funcao de speaker fica inativa, sendo necessario reiniciar o computador, tirando o cabo do telefone GE."
5,Burton transfers her characters into you inner being,"Meet Ellen. A child who many have forsaken. Her mother. Her brother. The root worker.This finely crafted novel takes you through Ellen's life a she sees it; her hope for things to change for the better. Her conflicting religious beliefs. Her pain. Her sorrow. Her triumph.The thing I enjoyed most about this book was the fact that after I read it it still lingered in my mind. I liked the fact that while I was reading my emotions were running on overtime. When something bad happened, my heart sank. When something good happened, I almost cried tears of joy.Warning: This is not a ""candy read"". Expect to be affected. Expect to feel the emotions and terror Ellen feels. Expect to feel your heart wrench. Expect to feel set free.From now on, I will expect nothing less.Hats off to this talented new writer on a dazzling debut."
3,"Not the ""typical"" book","This book was not at all what I expected. After reading the first page I was extremely confused and by the end of the book I was upset that I had wasted my time reading it. The book was written in such a way that did not seem to flow and make sense. References were made to things that didn't make sense, for instance, I was halfway through the book before I finally understood the reference to ""GLUE"", and I'm still fuzzy on it. I should have stopped after that first confusing page. But after looking at these other reviews that don't share my opinion, I see that maybe this book is on another level of fiction that I'm not used to- maybe ""science"" fiction-especially after reading the next to last chapter. Such a waste of my valuable reading time."
3,Messy,Great stuff . . . works well but the liquid form is hard to use. It has an Olive Oil base so it doesn't dissolve in water and it very hard to mix into anything. I'm getting the capsules next time.
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I feel so ripped off. I think the name should have been ""Two"" because your paying $2 for every minute of film. The movie itself was honestly about twenty minutes long and don't let them fool you with the side movies. EVERY SINGLE ONE was the same audio and video just edited in different ways(video montage, music video, bla bla) Also, the whole DVD focused on ""two"" waves which weren't even that big; like 30 feet. Bigger than I could ever handle but I would've rather seen the 70 foot waves that Laird talks about and that can be seen in other videos. Oh wait, they showed one for ""two"" seconds. The cinematography was good and Laird is a legend, but I was extremely disappointed in this DVD and you will be ""two"" if you're hoping to see some giant waves."
5,modern worship at it's finest,"A close friend gave me this cd over a year ago and I was immediatly impressed by the creativity behind the songwriting and the craftsmanship of the artists. Then, I recently got to attend a Christian Conference where they led worship twice a day for 5 days. This band has an amazing focus on true worship and great musicianship. The song-writing on this album is spectacular, and as a musician and a worship leader I can attest to their power, impact, and adaptability, because I use a lot of the songs from this album all the time. If you think you're remotely interested in this band, then get this disk. If for some increadibly wierd reason you're not pleased with it, then give it to a normal human being, because they'll love it."
4,2002 jeep wrangler,fit in nicely with a pioneer deh-1300mp. biggest pain was taking the old cd player/radio out.would buy it all over again.
4,"As they say down here ""This one's a keeper""","This CD is one of my favorites, cuts with Raitt, Clapton and Santana are over and over listens. I buy ""with friends"" selections with some trepidation but this one is worth the money."
4,Over an hour of classic blues,"John Lee Hooker's mumbling delivery always kind of bugs me. But his music usually makes up for it. High points on this CD are the songs with Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, and Santana. Everything on here is good, though."
5,"The one who says you can't get In the Mood w/ B. Raitt on a single mp3 is TOTALLY F""N FIRED!","One of the best songs ever and these skeezers know it...come on!!! We would pay $2 for that single, Give It!"
1,MISSING PIECES,I ordered 2 vehicle shocks advertized as new but one box had a taped note that there was missing parts. I e-mailed the vendor through Amazon but I have yet to recieve a responce. Label this vendor as unreliable. The Gabriel shocks are great but be careful of this vendors claims
2,too small,was too tight for my old moto Q. had to pry it out of the case. clip on back makes it kind of bulky
3,Planning Guide,"This CD is basically void of resources. A small amount of the information is inaccurate. As a planning guide for a medieval themed wedding, it's fine. As a resource on medieval weddings, you're better off doing an online search. I WILL use it whenever I get married, but not as a general resource for others (which was my purpose in buying it). (If it helps the casual planner, I've been referred to as a medieval ""period nazi"". The CD probably fulfills its intended purpose.)"
2,lots of blank space and lots of ads for the writer,"if you have no idea how to use a computer and research you probably would get some use from this booklet. (not a book-its a booklet) However if you are looking for research & informaion alot of it is incorrect. making a little flag next to a comment does not make it a ""historical fact"". You must say where or why or what research. If you want a fairytale medievalish wedding and haven't even looked into anything you will enjoy this booklet. if you want informaion and research...pass.Most of the info is fill- in pages that you can find in any planner. I also found that most of the sources are a ad for the writer or friends."
3,Medieval Renaissance Weddings CD,"I was planning a medieval/Renaissance wedding, and I wanted to make it as authentic as possible, so I decided to try this CD. This was indeed a very helpful resource, and yet it did not provide any way for me to print up pages off of the CD, which would've been a lot more helpful to me. Also, there was no way for me to navigate between different sections of the CD, so jumping around to specific sections I wanted was a lot more difficult that it would've been if the CD provided a ""back"" button. All in all, I ended up seriously wishing that I had ordered the book instead of the CD."
1,Star Trek Fan and Gamer,"Finally I thought they would make a Star Trek game good. But nooooooo, they have to make it one of the hardest games I've played in a while. First of all let me say that the one star is for the graphics. They did a great job bringing the ships to life but thats where the fun stops. Do the people that make these games ever try to play test them. Come on!!! All the computer ships do is fire straight at you until you hit them or until they pass you. There is no skill on their part. And how about 10 enemies vs 1 little ship...BOOM! I do have to say that fighting the big ships is fun, at least once you figure out their blind spot. Why can't they make a Star Trek flight sim fun instead of fighting for 30 minutes just to die at the very end or have the Ecselsior blow up and have to start all over. Save your money or rent it and make your own conclusions."
1,Shattered Universe shattered my nerves,"It's rare I find a game which makes me run screaming from the room. Shattered Universe is one of those. My quick thoughts:The good: decent voice acting from the actors who made Sulu and Chevokv famous; set in the Star Trek universe.The bad: Game play is repetitive and boring after just a few missions.The ugly: The game is just too damm hard on some missions. The aiming controls don't work well, and when you are trying to save the dead in the water Excelsior from 2 capital ships and 10 or so bombers, it's not worth wasting your time.BOTTOM LINE: Beam this piece of garbage into space Scotty!!"
2,Less than I had expected,"This game look promising but it had some fatal flaws. There were no training level. The control is too complicated to figure out. The action sequences get very repetitive after awhile. This game resemble the first target shooting game of Interplay's Starfleet Academy - Starfleet Command. Unless you are a die hard gamer, this game is not for the average game player."
2,star trek s.u. it's good but not the best,"i love star trek ever since i was seven. i will buy all star trek games if i can. i like this game fore how they did the starship enterprise. but gameplay was ok but i hate the ships exploding. it suck!. they could have did better. it's a good game but if they make another game, make it better, like star trek voyager elite force."
2,Please someone make a good ST game!!!!,"I have been an avid fan of ALL of the Trek shows, I read the books and collect the merchandise. Now with that being said I believe Paramount has made more than enough profit from all the combined shows, movies, syndications and books to put someone on the job to finally create an awesome game for the FANS. If it was not for us they would have a lot less moola. I'm not going to go into tearing this game to pieces over my dissapointment, I'll just say it was not worth it and I feel that Paramount owes me and the rest of the ST fans around the world a good game. So Paramount here is my challenge to you, Can you finally make a game worthy of the Fans that have made you more rich than you would have been without us. Get off your duffs and do something.Lloyd E. GardnerFormer ""Staff Sergeant"" USMC"
4,Horrible game,"This game is a complete waste of your money. Even on the easy level it's extremely frustrating, you will repeat levels over and over again, no matter what your skill level. It's pretty much the same thing each level as well, just described differently. The character models are articulated like undead zombies and the lip syncing with the dialogue is non existant. Characters sound good, having used the real Sulu and Checkov actors, but man did some putz do an extremely poor job on the graphics for them. Face it folks it's a complete stinker, you're better off spending your money elsewhere."
2,"A Waste of Time, and Money","I love Star Trek, but this game did not cut it. Belongs to the rentals. I had hoped to fly capital ships, decide whether I use up all ""auxilary power"" for the shields, or phaser banks, or for the warp core. This game was even cheaper than a ""Star W**s"" game. Flying with a small fighter, and the Klingon Bird of Prey was so small!! small as the little fighter we had to fly. The Bird of Prey did not even come close to the size of the capital ships. I am sorry for the people who authorized this production, and for the quality control testers, you did a bad job. Try this game, by renting it. Not worth buying."
2,HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!,"I'd been looking forward to a good space action shooter and i'm a big star trek fan but this game is rediculous. I like the theme with the Excelsior crew in the mirror universe but the game is far more difficult than it should be. You just get frustrated when you've been playing for 3 hrs straight and are only on the third frikkin' level. Also the scenery is way too visually loud. Every level so far has some kind of colorful nebula or something that makes it more difficult to see the small fighters in the distance, space is mostly BLACK and dark anyway! My advice, wait 6 months and buy it used from other suckers like me who are fed up with it. If i'd paid 20 bucks i wouldn't have been as disapointed."
5,Perfectly charming,"Want a great gay romance with some humor, a little angst, and a bit of heat? Try ""Trick."" The guys are cute, the characters are all appealing, and the story is literate without being overly artsy. It's a down-to-earth story about two men who are trying to connect sexually and end up connecting emotionally. Very satisfying on all counts."
5,This is one of the best movies i have ever seen!,Trick is the best movie i have seen in a long time. It shows that all gay people aren't stereotypical. The love story is amazing. The two actors really clicked on screen. The ending made me so happy. I think that everyone should own this movie!
5,Great Gay Romance,A simple gay romance movie that takes the long path to finding love. It is well worth the time to watch this and buy the dvd for your collection because you will want to watch it more than once.
5,A great Gay Romantic Movie,I have watched this movie for about ten years now and every time I view it I feel it is as fresh as when I first saw it. Actually it has become somewhat of a timecapsule of how young gay people are. With all the recent non community that this gay world of ours are handling there lives it should be viewed by more to remind them of just how real and fun life can be. Yes it becomes sappy at times but thats the movies my dears. It is a wonderful viewing for anyone looking for top notch acting and editing of a film. The go go boy is perhaps the best looking gay character ever in a gay film in my opinion. Absolutely beautiful and at the same likable. This is how people really feel in the world about there relations at the beginning of the journey into love. Highly recommened. If your completely jaded by life you may not buy it but try.
4,Buy This Movie,"I bought this movie, and expected it to be really great, and it was! I loved it. The characters are real, not the over used, over sexed ones you can find in a lot of ""gay"" movies out there. The setting is wonderful, completely in keeping with the feel of the movie, and the situations of the characters. Gabe is cute, vulnerable, and obviously working on achieving his dreams in life. Mark is Confident, macho, and really cute. They get to meet, and during the course of trying to have a one night stand, with constant interuptions, find the beginnings of a relationship. The supporting cast is great too. Tori Spelling is actually good in her roll as the ""gay man's best friend"" LOL you have to love that. The character of Perry is just incredibly funny, witty, and ultimately loveable. If you don't own this movie, buy it, rent it, get it any way you can, it is worth it."
5,Cutest film ever!,"Fine Line Features really grabbed a gem when they produced this film. Mark is absolutly beautiful in this film. DVD still is an excellent feature durring Mark's go-go dancing scene.But, the story itself is what really makes this film so wonderful. I've have shown this film to many of my friends and each one of them has a big, beaming smile on their face whenever they talk about ""Trick"". The story is one that many people can realate to: One guy wants to be with another guy, but something is keeping them from being together. However, with enough perpetuation, the obstacle can be overcome and bliss can be obtained.This film is so cute! I've seen it at least 5 times since I bought it 2 weeks ago."
4,"Top Rate, Wonderful Movie","One of the few gay movies that I absolutely loved. The actors, the story line and the relationships between them were absolutely wonderful. Finally a gay movie that can be enjoyed by every adult. It is nice to see a movie in which the main characters are not fighting HIV, their mother, or victims of gay bashing. The movies focuses not only on the gay characters but the frustrations and complications of dating and socializing in any relationship in this generation. Gay or straight, the commonality is relating to each other on a physical versus emotional level. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
5,JUST TOO CUTE,"Bought the DVD version, and cant stop watching it. Its a feel good gay movie.Just goes to show you, you can't judge a book, or guy, by thier cover. Gabriel shy and insecure blooms the longer he and Mark are together that long night. And Mark proves he's a romantic not caught up in the body beauitful trip (even though he has one) by turning down a host of hot guys that come on to him in favor of Gabriels company.The longer these two guys are together you just have that feeling of ""love at first sight"".Two lonely guys for different reasons, match. Now if they could just hook up."
3,Surprisingly fun for a non-gay...,"And did anyone else notice that the poisonous drag queen & Tori Spelling look alike? I give this film three stars for the cliches it avoided and for the fun and laughs. Since I hate the type of club music on the soundtrack and am not a gay man, I can't personally give it any more. And gay men who're a bit more intellectual and individualistic may not love it either. What I applaud is its step in the direction of more progressive, open-minded films about gay and bisexual life. I liked Chasing Amy and Kissing Jessica Stein a lot more, only partly because its female characters are more than sidekicks. Maybe the biggest eye-opener was the portrayal of how women come off to a particular type of gay man, some of which made me want to flinch, and some of which was disturbing: the similarity between the drag queen and Tori Spelling characters for me pointed up the need of some gay men to caricature women or make them very ""ugh,"" and that's hard to get behind."
3,Very Cute,Not the best one out there but it is very cute and heartwarming. The lead was cute but I think Tori Spelling and John Paul Pitoc give the film credibility. Christian Campbell is okay but doesn't seem quite comfortable playing a gay man.
5,SIMPLY CHARMING AND DELIGHTFUL,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to everyone. Christian Campbell (as Gabriel) was so charming and adorable, while J.P. Pitoc was such a hunk (what a body!). As for the movie itself, the plot was well developed, the music was great, and a very entertaining supporting cast, although Tori Spelling's character could be quite annoying at times. Overall, Trick is simply a very enjoyable movie. It is great to see a well-made gay romantic movie, as these movies are extremely rare."
3,Cute!,"This is a cute movie. A great light movie for a rainy afternoon or a first date.The story line is not too deep, and the characters are somewhat unbelievable. However, the eye candy is good and it's heart warming and fun."
2,Misfire,"After reading all the sterling reviews, I couldn't wait to treat myself to this ""gem."" Next time I will be more cautious. The film lacks the sense of humor it advertises. It has no sense of timing. And I felt the characters were generally lifeless, except for the one played by Steve Hayes. To its credit, this is not a film with a message; it wants you to sit back and enjoy. But it simply falls flat. If you like romantic comedies, stick with ""It Happened One Night"" or ""Arsenic and Old Lace."""
2,did not live up to expectations,"anticlimatic, lacking in story. there was more stereotypes inthis movie than should be permitted, the self-centered musclehead, theBroadway musical expert/songwriter who falls for him, the ultra-viscious dragqueen, the piano bar, and the ... hag who can't get lucky. all of these elements together create a film which is completely unoriginal, dull, and contrived. A far better gay film is Get Real. END"
2,TRICK,STORY WASN'T VERY INTERESTING.I'VE SEEN MUCH BETTER WHEN COMPARED TO LATTERDAY AND KISS THE BRIDE
4,awww it's soooo sweet......,"I don't know why I'm bothering to add my voice to the 45+ reviews when the majority are positive. But living in the uk it was worth having my DVD player chipped just for the pleasure of this sweet, funny story. I love the fact that as so often happens on the scene apparent deep guys can be quite shallow and shallow ""air heads"" so often have hidden depths of sweetness, brains and soul. I loved the film. It's not Mr Ripley but then sometimes ya just want a sweet bit of fun which, as I said, it most definately is. Hugz t'yall."
4,Bold and Courageous,"I guess gay lifestyle is now a reality in the US, and this movie portrays it as openly as it can. It is bold, somewhat graphic, and definetly courageous. This is not a movie for people with low tolerance about the alternative life-style. Very good acting and dialog. I wish the DVD had better sound quality and Dolby 5.1 surround sound. Excellent music, especially at the end during the credits. It is a good movie to buy and keep for people with tolerance about alternative life-style."
5,Delightful,This is one of those rare movies that is delightfully funny and romantic all at once. A true gem to see. It's cast delivers a most remarkable performance
2,not the best,"The movie was a little bit entertaining, but overall it was bad , bad acting , especially the irritating Tori Spelling, bad story and a little bit boring!"
5,"Trick, a surprise treat","Trick is a fun little romp through the world of gay Manhattan. It is light hearted and amusing. What begins as a night of cheap sex turns into so much more. Can a heartthrob go go boy find love with a shy songwriter? The twists and turns of this movie are both hilarious, and sometimes frightening. Miss Coco Peru's resemblance to Tori Spelling is uncanny. One never knows when or where true love will happen, and the course of which never ran smooth. It's light and happy fare, which is quite a change from the current gloom and doom which has been hovering over gay cinema for the last decade."
4,"Sweet, Sentimental Fun","Contrived, it is. Full of overblown performances; certainly. Fun: without a doubt.This is an almost embarrassingly sweet and sentimental exploration of what could happen when two well-intentioned boys get interrupted at every point in their attempts to have a little meaningless sex and find out that they actually like each other.It's paced well, edited well, has an effective supporting cast, and even a little fun music that works with the movie to make just a little magic. I was impressed. It's good, innocent, light-hearted fun. Worth a watch."
5,so cute and funny also,Great movie...perfect for a date. And that Pitoc guy is so charming with that smile of his. Funny from beginning to end.
4,Unexpectedly good fun,Usually I prefer more intense movies but this was so average and that was the point. Buy this.
5,Lots of fun,"This movie is so much fun, and the soundtrack is awesome too. It's a story of two guys in NYC trying to find a place...any place. Starring the cute Christian Campbell (the brother of Neve Campbell), the gorgous John Paul Pitoc (yummmm) and the adorable Tori Spelling as a wannabe Broadway star, this movie will leave you laughing and wanting more!"
3,This is one crazy movie!,"This movie just radiates sexual tension. To have these two guys just desperate to be alone, so they can screw each other, and not be able to do so, was very frustrating to watch. This movie was so funny to watch, and Mark the Go-Go boy was very nice to look at prancing around on the stage in a G-string. I also think that Tori Spelling was good in her role as the whacked out, very talkative, and very hyper best friend (I also got the idea that she might have lesbian tendencies)of the musical composer-I forgot his name."
5,When is a Trick more than a Trick,"Everything about this film is funny. It's name suggest that the film will be more radical than it turns out to be but it is fun and in the end, even straights might find themselves looking for a Trick."
4,Trick is full of surprises,"Such a strange movie, in a good way. Not what I was expecting when I got it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a sweet, albeit slightly unbelievable, story that was easy to watch without having to invest a lot of thought into it. The progress made by Gabriel and the change in Mark make the movie entertaining, a good movie, indeed."
4,"Charming movie, marginal DVD","Trick is a charming story, delightfully told, one of my favorite gay-themed movies of all times. This movie was made somewhat on the cheap 11 years ago and technology has advanced considerably since then. However, it probably would have been better to have left well enough alone than to ""enhance"" it for wide-screen t-v's. We're left with a grainy out-of-proportion picture that detracts from complete enjoyment of the film, but fortunately does not entirely override it's indelible charm and wit."
4,"Charming, fast paced and romantic film","This is a romantic, funny and very sexy movie. My friends (straight and gay) always enjoy watching it at my place. The guys are really hot; the story is somewhat suspenseful and the music is great. Tori Spelling is hilarious; there is electricity between the male leads and the movie is quite fast paced."
4,Cute Movie,"Fun, cute romance. The New York City setting adds a lot to this comedy, and Tori Spelling is hilarious."
5,simply excellent!,This a truly superb movie. One that will be watched again and again. A comedy and a true love story. a must see!
4,Great,"What a great film. While it certainly is not deemed a classic film by any standards, it is a gay-themed film that should be seen by all. The casting is perfect (catch that go-go dancer/Trick) and Tori Spelling is ideal in the role she is given. It was totally engrossing, uplifting and 90 minutes well spent. I was smiling at the end, and what better recommendation than that is needed."
5,Awesome movie...,"I have experienced several gay films in my day, but ""Trick"" is by far, the best that I have seen. Trick creates a beautiful love story in modern times that captivates the audience to imagine the possibilities of a gay romance founded on ""love at first sight."" I really enjoyed this film and J.P. Pitoc's body. ""Trick"" is a definite must have."
3,I like Christian Campbell!,"Ok, the story line is cute...but not as cute as Christian Campbell! Ha! I love him, that's why I bought this movie."
4,Good,"Jim Falls did a good job in making a feel good gay movie. Much like ""Beautiful Things"", the sentiment was clear, its hard being gay and finding a meaningful relationship. Or any relationship. Christain and John Paul did a good job as well. They were loveable and they convinced me to care whether the characters got together."
5,"A Classic, Romantic and Funny Love Story",What a fun movie. You can't help but fall in love with the characters and situations (or non-situation) that the characters get into. From scene to scene a beautiful love story unfolds into a classic and great ending. Well worth my 90 minutes of viewing time anytime.
2,Lacking everything.,"The movie always seemed to be lacking something, maybe it was the cute guy of the movie only had 10 lines. I was waiting for some sortof romantic climax in the movie but I received no such luck. The only romantic parts were when the two guys held hands and they frenched at the end--seriously. Dont get this movie if your expecting sex to be in it, there isnt any. The movie doesnt focus on the ga couple alot to begin with. There is a lot of wasted time in this movie that could have been spent on the gay couple."
1,Too campy and cliche,"I try to support the gay community by watching films that attempt to represent it. This is one the gay community could have done without. I guess this movie would be alright if you're a stereotypical showtune-listening, Tori Spelling-loving, club kid, who falls head-over-heels for anything that looks good in a tight shirt.The lives of most gay men, however, consist of much more than this. I prefer a film with a bit more substance. There is simply too much cliche in this film: gay club, one-night stand, broadway musical, and a muscle queen. And I think we've seen it better before.There's very little originality here. If you're the kind of person that thinks these are the key issues in a gay man's life, and are willing to see them time and again, this film's for you. If you're tired of this stereotype, whether gay or straight, pass this one by."
3,ok,"Dorky guy gets the ideal go go boy. Yes the go go boy was hot but.. this movie just was missing something, like how and why did they dive into a ""relationship"" so quick, and that chick from 90210 as a lesbian or something, oh please! Spare Me."
2,Chalkboard,"If you like nails on a chalkboard, you'll love this one. The main characters failure to make a decision is annoying and detracting. Nice idea gone painfully bad."
2,What did I Order Here!!!!!,"I ordered this while on a Tori spree,I ordered her book & I Love Tori so I looked up movies she had done & I never saw or herd about this one so I ordered it paying No Mind to the cover,well I watched it today & aside from Tori Not being in what 75% of the movie I ""thought"" I read the reviews,I usually do if I've never seen the movie,SURPRISE to Me it's about 2 Gay Men & it dose little for this single,straight,mom,but aside from it not being my forte I did like the guy Derry/Barry the older guy & Hot guy who had his glasses on his forehead while at bar,and few other parts."
2,"yeah CUTE, but you actually call this a MOVIE?","Well, what I thought in the end of the film was ""oh no, don't tell me you actually end a movie like this!""Sure this movie had some cute scenes, Campbell's performance was nice,Spelling was funny, Pitoc's body was gorgeous (but he sure CAN'T act!), blah blah blah.But you expect A LOT more from a movie which you actually PAY to go see. I mean everything was so...amateur-ish, good or bad. You'd rather go see a local high school movie festival or something. This time for free ;)"
4,Pick It Up,"This soundtrack is great, although it's hard to come by. It's worth owning just for Erotic City - that's an awesome track. If you can get your hands on it, I highly recommend it. Too bad it never got radio airplay."
3,And the title is....,"FYI-The song that Jeremy puts on when he locks the cabinet at the faculty party is ""Afternoon Delight"" by the Starlight Vocal Band. It was pure corny 1970's (1977, I believe), but people actually bought the record - and quoted the lyrics. It was either that or the Saturday Night Live soundtrack. Nobody wanted to admit it publicly, but many had the album tucked away some- where."
3,Handy Tuba Rest,It's sturdy and the height is adjustable. The problem is that the soft foam rubber pad upon which the base of the Tuba rests is not well glued to its cradle. This measn that care has to be taken to ensure that the Tuba remains properly supported. Also the foam is in danger of getting lost in transit.
3,It does the job at the right price,"This rest does it's job. The foam starts to fall off after a few weeks. I had to add a cover to the stand to prevent the tuba from getting stretched. It is cheaper then the other tuba rests out there, so you get what you paid for. This one was the right price and portable to and from my sons lessons."
2,Too weak for me,"This couldn't hold up my 5/4 PT6, not to mention when I have my mute in. Even with some modifications, it is far from ideal, and it's possible to start to strip the knob that provides the tension to hold the rod supporting the tuba. Some people have modified this successfully using drills, but that's too much trouble for me.Maybe someone can use this with a lighter instrument, but I can't use it."
1,weak stuff!,"Bolo is in the flick, but not for an hour! The martial arts is terrible, poorly choregraphed and the plot is horrible. The navigation menu is tight, the extras rule but not the film. If you want to see a real kungfu movie, buy Jade Claw, Master Killer, Five Deadly Venoms, Enter the Dragon, or Jet Li's Fist of Legend. Thats Kungfu a$$ kicking 101! As for ""10 Magnificent Killers"", I think I will just give it away."
5,action packing put u in traction!!!!,"This has 10 killers going at it!The Wu has picked some jewels for they Hidden Chamber series.It's THE BEST DVD series out there.All the films are tight including this one.It's got BOLO and some other dudes that I recognize from alot of flicks.The bonus features are heavy including a 10 mag fights chamber that has the dopest fights I've ever seen put together.This is ... that was held back in china or something cuz I've never seen them before. The Wu chamber is tight as ever,and the master's chamber has real Shaolin monks dropping jewels.Then there's the 18 Fatal previews chambers showing other Grond Zero flicks,plus the non kung fu ... like Blazin',which is also tight. Get these Hidden Chamber flicks on DVD. ....Peace!!!!"
4,Very entertaining,"When this book arrived I was suprised at how incredibley short it was. It's only 151 pages and the type-face is relatively large. But nonetheless, I enjoyed the book and I found it to be very entertaining. You can tell the author is a writer for the Simpsons because the humor is quick, almost random at some points, and the book cuts from scene to scene very rapidly. It's an EXTREMELY fast-paced book. I finished it in about a day. But if you enjoy the Simpsons, like I do, then you'll definetly enjoy this book."
3,pretty good...,"As an avid fan of the simpsons, I was expecting a book full of mirth. And while it was a good read, it fell short of my expectations. I do, however expect that Mr. Swartzwelder's books get better as he gets more novel experience."
3,"good album, bad sound","the first half of this album is downright awesome. the first 7 tracks have a couple of some my favorite minutemen songs. after that, 'tune for wind god' is a great jam, 'party with me punker' is still a classic, 'joy jam' is interesting to hear spot jamming with the band on clarinet, and 'tony gets wasted in pedro' is one of my fav minutemen songs too and is really overlooked in my opinion. there's 2 demos of mike singing and playing bass which are pretty much filler and i guess are important just for those who want every possible minutemen related recording known to man. then the live tracks are very good performances, but they sound terrible. it sounds like you could turn up one of their studio albums really loud and walk around your house outside listening to it and it would sound similar. in other words its really muffled and frustrating. this is not for beginners obviously just because of the sound."
3,Good Basic Raw Introduction,"I had already been using RAW for some time and wanted to see if there was anything I was missing. This book does a nice job of explaining how to use RAW, but I didn't find anything I wasn't already doing."
2,A Moms Mabley for Intellectuals!,"Bell Hooks can be an amusing read if you don't take her seriously. She's clearly VERY UNHAPPY about the state of the world and there are enemies under every bed. Her folksy wrath is devoid of logic, grace, and class, and she uses the English language wretchedly. Moreover, she plays the race card unashamedly. Still, if you can enjoy the show without taking anything she says too personally, she is kind of a hoot."
2,odd...,"All photographs I've seen of Bell Hooks would certainly indicate that, yes, she is a woman -- if not a very coherent or well-spoken one. Somebody get this woman a refresher course in the Queen's English."
5,Nice Collectible,This was purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter to add to her collection of Barbies. It is a beautiful doll and my daughter is very pleased with it.
1,Very Cheap Nozzle,This nozzle fell apart on me after a few weeks of use. Now it sprays water everywhere and can't be turned completely off. This is partially my fault for ordering the cheapest one they have. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more to get a quality nozzle.
4,Aging Gracefully.,"""Beautiful Girls"". What a fantastic opportunity for lovers of Broadway musicals to see the behind the scenes creation and making of a successful musical in four days. This film is in part documentary combined with hi-lights of the finished performance at Lincoln Center with the New York Philharmonic. The story line of ""Beautiful Women"" attending a Follies Reunion so many years into retirement is powerful and awakens thoughts of aging. Mandy Patinkin, Carol Burnett, Barbara Cook and Lee Remick lead an all star cast in this Steven Sondheim Classic. You might want to view this film more than once."
3,Follies In Concert,"I saw the PBS special of Follies and was blown away (no reference to the Clinton Administration intended) at the incredible talent onstage. I have the CD and was a disappointed when I purchased the VHS tape to discover I had the ""rehearsal"" video. I'd give anything to get the tape of that fantastic performance (my CD says it's a compilation of two night's performances). If anyone finds the PBS video, please post a message."
1,This video is as cracked as the face on the logo :(,"I REALLY like the soundtrack and the originally broadcast show I saw on PBS years ago. The stars and the songs are incredible. However, this DVD only shows parts of most of the songs and omits some of the very best songs and scenes altogether. It is also a grainy copy that looks like it was dubbed on an old VHS video tape. Please save yourself the time, the money, and the memories, if you have seen this show before. Sometimes the memories are better than the reality. Athough that is also the message of this musical, it should not be a message conveyed to consumers by the publishers of this poorly crafted DVD."
5,WAY UP THERE.........,"LEE ..... Lee Remick, Barbara Cook, Mandy, George, Liliane, Carol ..... {A}licia ...Liz ...Betty ....Adolphe .... how quickly it fades .......SO????It's not complete - but WHAT we have is LEGEND!So priceless ..... WHERE IS the MOVIE Version?MGM was supposed to do this way back .......WHY do we wait ... ?This DVD is merely a TANTALUS version ... excellent but just a glimpse of THE GREATNESS of the Great White Way ....OK .... so just where are the new Ziegfelds????????[Streisand should consider this vehicle ... from a director's pov. Reynolds, Powell, MacLaine, Grayson, Gaynor, Andrews, Close, LuPone, Page, Minelli, Menzel and Chenowith ... and the others are STILL around .....for now ......]DO THIS !"
1,Outrageous!,"This is not ""Follies in Concert,"" it is the reader's digest version. Many numbers have been truncated and many omitted, most notably ""Waiting for the Boys Upstairs"" and ""The Road I Didn't Take."" While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape. Include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews, and the concert is basically cut in half. In addition, the DVD is video tape quality and the sound is unstable. All in all, a very disappointing recording for Sondheim lovers."
4,"Hats off, here they come those beautiful girls!","This is by far my favorite musical, not the concert but the actual musical from the 70's. When i saw Alexis Smith the first time i fell deeply in love. Of course i was only 24 at the time.Even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it's better than nothing at all. This cast was also wonderful with it's vintage and well polished cast, I gave it the four stars only because it's not as complete as the CD. After all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers.Maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this DVD?To all those wonderful women who were in the original production,,,Hats off, to those wonderful girls.. The likes of this will never come again."
2,it's a keeper,if only for the nostalgia! the video is of poor quality. Very grainy! The sound is less than ideal. Someone should have gone through the trouble of remastering the video and the audio before releasing it! Age of the concert is not an excuse! I own DVD's whose program content is older than the follies in concert and they sound better and the video excellent.
1,old documentary!,"Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of ""Company"" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word ""concert"" or ""soundtrack"" in DVD title."
5,Guitar Tuner,This item was just what I need at the time. It arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged.
5,"Great tuner for price, reliable lasts forever","Great functionality, awesome price, has tones to get you close, then use the screen to hone it in better. a"
4,Worth The Buy,"I have never bought a tuner before, so I didn't know what to really look for. I found this for a cheap price, read some good reviews, so I decided to give it a go. I can tell you its well worth the money. It's very easy to use and lightweight. The only thing I dislike about it is how dim the screen is, but that isn't too much of a problem.Worth the buy if you need a decent portable tuner!"
4,A Great Tuner,I am glad I purchased this tuner. It is easy to use and compact enough to fit in your case. I like the needle feature and recommend it as a quick and simple tuner.
5,worth the price,"i looked at other tuners and i thought about buying a more expensive one, but this one is totaly worth the price and is great for my acoustic guitar."
3,"Good, but a bit unsteady","I bought this due to other reviews, and wanted a ""in line"" tuner, with a needle, or pointer meter..not just LED lit.The meter is far better when setting harmonics, intonation. It has a handy fold out stand, for the money decent. But on the con side, it is unsteady, the needle on certain harmonics and notes will not stop and ""lock"" on the note, it will dance above and below what you seek, so you may have to ""ballpark it"" so to speak, which is okay, but again when setting intonation I don't want to ""ballpark"" anything. I have a cheap Quick Tune that does better in this regard, I ping a string, fretted or open and the needle goes to the pitch and holds steady, way better than this unit. Still, one must look at how much they didn't spend and factor that in. It's a decent tuner, for the money, and it has the output jack so the unit can be placed inline....I will keep it for that reason and upgrade for more steady accurate adjustments in terms of harmonics, and intonation."
2,Guitar tuner,Admittedly I just got my first bass guitar so value my opinion from someone who doesn't know how to play. I was hoping for an easy way to tune my bass. This tuner is not that easy. The instructions are not written very clearly so you will find yourself pushing different buttons to see if the note you are playing registers. I can't accurately say that this product is useful.I am still figuring it out.
3,Not very sensitive,I have a Epiphone Les Paul Special 2 and this tuner wouldn't reconise all of my strings. Because the tuner wasn't helping ( and I'm new at this ) I ended up breaking a string. I sent this back and got this:[..]That works well for my Les Paul and is far more sensitive ( a good thing ) and is at a good price.
5,Perfect Little Tuner,"Korg makes fantastic tuners. I used the GA-30 a lot before picking up this model. Both are fantastic. If you need your tuner to operate in-line, then this is a great choice. If you don't care that much, or really don't plan on using it in-line, just go for the GA-30. If you want to use a lot of non-standard tuning, I suggest model CA-30 or CA-40, both of which are chromatic tuners. They can tune to any of the 12 pitches across any octave (so far as I can tell). They don't include presets for Guitar or Bass, though, so you need to know which notes to be tuning yourself.It is cheap enough for you to give it a try."
4,Guitar & Bass tuner review,It's a very useable tool that is quick & simple and helps me to have better clarity with my guitar.
4,Korg Guitar Tuner,This tuner is very portable and easy to use. The display is clear and the needle as an indicator provides good feedback when one is in tune.
2,Pretty much worthless - unless you are tone deaf,I bought this Korg GA-40 tuner to assist me in setting up my Floyed Rose tremolos on my Jackson and Schecter guitars - because I wanted pin point accuracy in my tuning. It was slow responding and irritating to use. I was able to set them up faster and more accurate by ear and ended up using it just to double check my accuracy. I guess it is an essential item for someone who is tone deaf. Why somebody who is tone deaf would decide to become a musician is quite baffling.
4,----------------,"Good tuner, good quality. Good screen size.Pretty good tuner for price, would recommend to a friend"
5,Great Product for the money,Great item and easy to use. Out of the box it only took ten minutes to tune the guitar.
5,Works,This thing works well and is a little easier to see and less jumpy than my old tuner. The LEDs are a little cheesy compared to the old one though. But maybe that saves on battery life. I don't know. It gets five stars for just doing its job quietly and for a fair price and not breaking.I'm also glad I bought the one specifically for guitar/bass and not the chromatic one.
5,Great! Works perfectly!,"I just started on my way to learn how to play the guitar and having your guitar tuned is one of the most important things as you dont want to get used to the wrong tones on the wrong strings. This little device works great and helps you tune your guitar quite fast and easy. I think it does a great job and I would definitely recommend it. Plus, the price is great!"
4,"good product, but not the most accurate","Good tuner, but it has trouble discerning some strings from each other, even when the guitar is properly tuned. This may be normal with guitar tuners, as this is the first one I've ever owned. Other than that, it's a good, cheap tuner that gets the job done, but probably not the best choice for a professional player."
2,"MMMM, There are better tuners.","I would spend my money on the CA-30 chromatic tuner, you can tune drop d, c, open d, etc. Not with this one. This one only seems to be good enough for standard tune."
1,broken,Tuner never worked. Seller failed to send a return label and harassed me by phone and email for negative feedback.
5,Good product,Thank you for sending the Korg on time and in good shape. The recipient of it was delighted to get itJack Cedarholm
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,"I OWN IT! I JUST GOT THIS TUNER AND TRYED IT OUT AS SOON AS IT CAME IN... WELL, IT WORKS, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS I DO. I CAN DO A BETTER JOB WITH OUT IT... WHEN I CHECKED TO SEE IF IT WAS ON THE MONEY, IT WAS NOT, THE TUNER SAID IT WAS RIGHT ON BUT IT WAS OFF A VERY SMALL BIT. I STILL HAD TO USE MY OWN EAR. IN ANY CASE, IT IS VERY GOOD FOR ADDING NEW STRINGS OR FOR A NEW AXE THAT NEEDS NEW STRINGS. YOU ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
2,Not very good product,"The supplier was great with fast shipping and item was well packed. I lost (or someone relieved me of) my good tuner. I has purchased a temporary one at a local chain store for 8 or 9 bucks. I ordered the Korg GA-40 which was disappointing to say the least. The ""needle"" is all over the place, both on acoustic and electric guitars. If you hit a string, it may show it to be quite flat, without touching the tuning, if you hit it again, it shows it quite sharp. The tunes was totally useless and I gave it to a student (who threw it out) and went and got the 8-9 dollar one at the local store."
4,Tuner,"I ordered this tuner for my son who built a Blue Man Group instrument and needed to finish the project. I had no problems with the ordering, payment or with receiving the item."
5,"Great tuner, works consistently and easy to read","The Korg GA-40 is a great tuner for electric guitar; just plug one 1/4"" cable from your guitar into it's input and it's ready to go. It automatically senses the string being tuned and has a handy green/red LED plus visual graph to show how close each string is to being in tune. Very fast and easy to use, well built and a solid bit of gear; highly recommended, it's one of my favorite guitar tuners (along w/the Snark)."
3,quick and easy,Gets the job done. nothing fancy. Haven't really figured out how to do any drop or alternate tunings with it. Impossible to read in low light. But for a quick and easy tuner for standard tuning its a good piece for low price.
1,Disappointment,"I've been very disappointed with this tuner. When I've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). I have two(2) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them. I bought this KORG because it's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation. Even though my tow(2) Wal-Mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this KORG."
5,Works well,"I am a novice guitar player and this tuner works very well for me. It is easy to use and picks up the notes on my acoustic very well. There are a couple songs I play that require it tuned one step down and, again, the tuner makes it easy. For the cost, it was a great purchase."
5,Very Nice Tuner,"I had been using and analog tuner for years. When it finally died, I was not sure that this tuner could be a satisfactory replacement. The price was so low that I had to get it. Now that I have used it for a month or so, I love it. I wish I had upgraded a long time ago. it's a wonderful tuner. The best I've ever owned."
4,"""He's where he wants to be."" -- Kim","Love, Loss and Longing, the three elements of a love song, are here applied to the screen: a young boy's love of family, the tragic -- and suspicious -- loss of his family and a subsequent longing that reaches into manhood. Filmmaker Carl Watts adds a complex fourth element to that mix: closure begets Redemption -- a surreal ""where he wants to be"" return to childhood sans the evil that made the young boy an orphan. Via ""a time warp or something,"" orphaned no more. Fanciful? Could be. Yet, here is a convincing drama of masterful interplay of family, envy, evil, romance, closure and ultimate redemption with not a few tugs at the heart strings along the way."
5,Bravo!,"Salvage Dream gets an enthusiastic nod! Watts deserves five stars for this Rod Serling like romance drama. A quirky psychiatrist (Kurt Schwoebel) hooks up two of his patients, who head out to help each other chase their dreams. Mary Elizabeth Boylan is charming and completely believable as Kimberly. She's a great find with a future. Watts's films improve with each effort, and bear watching now and down the line."
2,Mediocre at best,"When I received a request to review this film - a week after viewing it, I actually had to look it up to remember it. OK... my memory is bad, but this film was very forgettable."
1,keep your dollar,"Maybe you are in the same situation I was; you have about an hour window for watching entertainment and you do a quick search for any $0.99 content. Lo and behold you find this indie title with 4 stars and it's a SF romantic drama to boot.However, this title does not merit that many stars in my opinion. The actors are, as Jon Lovitz's Master Thespian would say, ""acting."" The sound recording quality is poor. As for the writing - I turned this off about 10 minutes in after the therapist character is used to provide backstory by telling one patient details about another patient."
1,Turkey,"It is 3 days before Thanksgiving and I would not even consider serving this anywhere. Truly one of the worst movie productions I have ever seen. I can not even believe I actually sat through the whole thing. Where do I start - the plot was elementary school and the script on an equal par with that. I have seen better acting in a bad high school play. I don't even think there was a director. For the people who left high marks for this waste of time - I wonder if they are trying to play some kind of joke. Just pass by this one, folks and fast!"
1,Ugh!,If you keep track of the worst movies ever made don't miss this one. The writing is so bad I felt sorry for the cast who looked like reasonable people. I can not believe that anyone who actually saw this travesty gave it a high rating.
3,not bad...,"This book had a very slow beginning, so it was kind of hard to stick with it. However, about 3/4 through it, the plot developed and I was completly glued to it until the end. Basically, this story is about a girl named Isabel taking on her mother's responsibilities and dealing with the average teen's troubles along with it. It's a sad, but touching story that any teenage girl might want to read over the summer. I wouldn't highly recommend it though."
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased these binoculars based on the posted reviews. Upon receiving and trying them out, the first impression is:Pros:compact, lightweight, pouch with belt loop, good short range abilityCons:Cheap look and feel, eye cup covers come off easily and will get lost sooner or later, neck strap is flimsy and on the short side, eye interval is rather narrow and if your eyes are wide apart like mine, you can't increase the inverval enough to accommodate both eyes at the same time"
5,Just the right binocs,I bought the Olympus glasses for my wife to use primarily around the house for bird watching. We live on acreage and she can sit on the front or back porch and watch all our local birds within a couple acres with no problem. They are powerful yet lightweight and comfortable in the hand. Easy to focus the 8x25 lenses.
3,"Nice binocs, not good if your eyes are far apart.","These are nice binoculars with good optics for the price, and they are light. They are not waterproof or armored, so you have to be careful with them. The real problem is that the interpupillary distance is too small for the length between my eyes, so I returned them for the Leupold Rogue Compact 8x25 Porro, which fit me better, and are waterproofed. But the Olympus Trackers are decent binoculars and cheaper than the Leupold's."
5,Great Value,"We wanted a second pair of binoculars that would be lightweight and compact for traveling to areas to view wildlife in medium to close conditions, sometimes with low light. These proved to fit the bill very well. The image is clear and bright and most important for wildlife viewing, the focus is easy and quick to adjust on the fly. Frankly, it's hard to imagine doing much better for the price."
3,Interesting DVD,I also was surprised at how they filmed the Sundance ceremony itself. My understanding is that it is not done. However the dvd had good information and was very interesting. Packaging was cruddy however the case came broken into little parts.
4,Opposites,A cute book with vivid and funny pictures. The pull-out attribute of this books adds to the charm and will entertain little ones not only in seeing the opposites on the page but also using the tactile opposite of pulling(out the page) and pushing (in the page). Also great for that little Space Explorer!
5,"Easy to read, detailed, and well-worth the money","This is the best reference on ergonomics that I have found in 30 years as an engineer. I've had a unique career in that I've spent time on ""the boards"" drawing and therefore designing equipment. Though dated this book is what you need to design instruments, controls and equipment for human use.If this recommendation was useful, please add your vote."
4,Interesting Perspective on Complex Topic,"Maryam Qudrat is very opinionated for one so young, but she has the credentials to back up her opinions. Readers may not agree with her analysis of the relations between Afghanistan and the US, but we have to give her credit for having the experience to back up her views. At the very least, her ideas are very interesting.I really enjoyed the memoirs aspect of this book and learning how it feels to strongly identify with two entirely seperate countries and cultures."
4,Recommended!,"Author's did an excellent job describing her family's cultures and custom, and the huge differences between Afghan Muslim and Talibans (Terrorism). This book is strongly recommended~"
2,Obviously Angry Woman Fails to Sway My Opinion,"After reading other reviews of this book, I thought it would add to my understanding of the Afghan situation and what people of Afghan-American heritage face here in the US. Unfortunately all I 'heard' was an angry woman shouting about how unjust her life is. While obviously articulate and intelligent, Ms Aseel's own voice is what turned me off about the book. Rather than offer suggestions or alternatives to what she sees as areas of difficulty between the American and Afghan cultures, she seems to prefer the approach that if you shout loudly enough, someone else will come up with a solution. I didn't end up learning anything new and her shouting failed to sway me to her viewpoint. I was greatly disappointed."
5,METICULOUS,"Maryam Qudrat Aseel offers an insightful account of the roots of U.S.-Afghanistan relations. Even more interesting is how this relationship is significant to the U.S.-Islamic world relations. The author is clearly entrenched in the issues that she commands knowledge of from her experences with the Muslim communities. Thus far, I have only seen one-sided accounts on this topic and it is extremely refreshing to find a view that encompasses all who are affected. I learned a great deal from this book and enjoyed the engaging writing style."
2,"Pram's 1st album, but NOT the place to start","I adore Pram. I don't have all their work so can't comment completely, but I find this one of the more difficult works to get into. They are known for quirkiness (odd beats and sounds and instruments), a post-rock sound a la stereolab with a more jazzy/Sun Ra side.This 1st CD is much more edgy, claustrophobic: a bit noisy, a bit of early Moonshake. Really, it is as if Pram is trying to get 70's Siouxsie and the Banshees to play a Pram song (a whisper of gothic in the quirkiness.)""Day the Animals Turned on the Cars"" - an entertaining instrumental ala film before audio, like Vertov""Dead Piano"" - noisier post-punk-rockI like this debut CD of theirs a lot better than when i first got it, but I'd recommend those new to Pram start with ""Helium"", ""Museum of Imaginary Animals"" or ""Dark Island"". This has its meritts and certainly some will defend it vigorously."
4,funny times,i know ricky gervais is a funny man. i just wish i realized that the dvds couldn't be played on us dvd players.
3,"""It's Reggae"".","""H.R.'s"" band ""Bad Brains"" may be the punkest of the punk, but this is nothing but cool reggae jams and positive vibrations. The whole disc is good, but I especially like ""Shame In Dem Game"", ""Selassie Fee"", and ""Saddest Day"". His album ""Singin' In The Heart"" is great as well, but it doesn't have the sweet cover photo like this does. He also actually has an anthology out too. Whatever you do though, don't see him live, he's an absolute nut-job."
1,Please describe the product!!,"I don't know what it is about people who produce these compilations. They seem to be convinced that us video music fans simply prefer to have people TALKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE VIDEOS!I bought this thinking the interviews were separate from the videos -(per the description) and for about 6.00 used, how could anyone go wrong?In short, if you are looking for the actual, complete, *un-interrupted* videos from these artists, save your money.AMAZON - PLEASE TAKE GREATER TIME IN MAKING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ""VIDEO COMPILATION"" AND ""VIDEO DOCUMENTARY"" - COULDA SAVED ME A LOT OF MONEY!!!!"
2,Small and cluttered,"I purchased this item for my mother because her old one broke. She loves to play this game and plays all the time. However when her old one broke she asked me to find a replacement in which I did. This came up with the most positive reviews but in particularly that it was easy on the eyes. Since my mother is getting older, she requested that I find one that was easy to see, play and operate. What we actually received was a smaller screen than expected, but the numbers in the boxes had numbers in the line itself. Thus creating a very cluttered look and somewhat unreadable screen for someone with older eyes (even I have trouble making out the numbers). This item does do its job and comes with a couple of bells and whistles, I would not recommend it for people with old eyes or have trouble seeing small numbers. Now I am back on the hunt for another handheld!"
3,I'm a beginner player.,"I guess this was kind of cheap, and it does work, but it is hard to see unless you hold it just right. It severely needs a back light."
4,Not bad at all,It is a good game if you like Sudoku. The screen is too dark though. I do enjoy Sudoku but seem to have a favorite level and am concerned that I have seen too many of the same screens. I am not sure but it seems that way. It is durable as I have dropped it several times and the battery life is great. Just make sure you have plenty of light to work in.
5,Great documentary on the series. Well done!,"This documentary covers the original Planet Of The Apes films and TV series' (including, briefly, the cartoon). Extremely well done. Hosted by Cornelius/Caesar/Galen himself, Roddy McDowell. This documentary tells the complete story of the films, with loads of behind the scenes information, photos, and footage. You also get to see some of the original makeup test used to sell Fox on the film (but not the ENTIRE test, as the packaging implies), as well as some promotional material, and an interview with McDowell. The interview is a mixed-bag, as there is no microphone on the person CONDUCTING the interview, so you can bately hear the questions (if at all). That minor grievance aside, this is a fantastic, 2-disc set, and I recommend this to any Planet Of The Apes fan."
3,"If you already have the box set version, skip it....","This was a great disc but I dont feel that the extras included here warrant a repurchase. I was glad to have seen it but watched it once and resold. The menus are different. All you're really missing is an LONG interview with Mcdowell, alot of 'trailer variations' and a pretty lengthy section set to the theme music that shows all the outtakes and unused footage run together. I'm not sure it's worth 21.00 considering the repeated viewing value....For die-hards only if you already have the box set version."
4,Look into the making of the apes saga!!!(...),"This is a great documentary on how the apes saga was made.This 2 disk DVD set takes you behind the scenes of Planet of the Apes.It is an great experience for apes fans.Hosted by Roddy McDowall(actor who played Cornelius,Caesar,and Galen)it is alsome!There is some things I do not like about it though.One thing is on the interview with Roddy McDowall.I just think that its to long and I don't think anywone would want to watch 1 hour and more of Roddy McDowall talking.Also I hate how the dailies and outtakes don't have any sound.You don't even now whats going on half the time.This is still a good experience and I think you should get it!!(...)"
2,Not Great,"Not a great phone, for sure, but worked fine for a little while. After about a year or two of very light use the display on all phones started to fizz out. Today (about year three) there is no display visible at all, so I am forced to replace the system and am trying another brand."
2,Display went after only two years of light use,"These phones were great. We bought them when we signed up for voice-over-IP phone service (like Vonage). The sound quality was great and we would have liked to have been able to keep these phones longer. However, after two years of light use (we are a young couple and also use our cell phones) the display completely crapped out. Probably 50% of the pixels sporadically stopped working so it was impossible to tell who was calling, how many missed calls, and who's calls we missed. Unless you don't care about those things, don't get these phones."
2,Sound quality greatly lacking,"This phone system looks great and is easy to set up. It is nice to have the ability to have a remote handset downstairs. However, the sound quality is absolutely horrible. There is a constant buzzing in the ear piece when attempting to talk on the phone. People on the other end of the phone often ask if we have a bad connection because the buzzing actually is audible to the other party.I have contacted the manufacturer for warranty service. This required me to box up the phone system and mail it to a service center in Arkansas. So, I will be without the phone for a couple weeks, I'm sure. I put my 10 year old phone back into service while I await the return of this new phone system. The old one is still working great! So, this system better come back in perfect working condition or I am going to return it and use the old cordless phone I have relied upon for years."
1,Terrible Phone,"Can't hear anything. So much background noise and static. Too much time passed and I couldn't return the phones so I had to go buy a new one. Got an AT&T model, also DECT 6.0, works beautifully. The manufacturer should pull this garbage off the market. It gives them a bad name."
1,Returning phone,I hated this phone. The speaker phone has good audio but the ear speaker is terrible. Many times the voice is so garbled I can't heear the other user. I am returning the phone today.
1,"Terrible phone, sorry I bought it.","The display contrast makes it hard to read and there isn't a way to change it. There are 20 ringer sounds to choose from, only 2 of which are bearable. The ringer is hard to hear even on its loudest setting. After a few days the phones stopped displaying the caller's name and number and only displayed ""no data"" or ""incomplete data"" (I know its not my service because my upstairs phones were displaying it fine). The sound on the answering machine is terrible, my outgoing message sounds like I am talking into a can while standing in a cave.The only good thing I can say about it is the range. I was able to walk all over my house, upstairs and down, even go outside, and I never lost the connection or heard static. My other phones break up when you leave the room their base is in.But in the end, the phones are garbage and I strongly recommend staying away from them.I have returned the phones since they are clearly not worth the price."
1,Bad Phone - Don't Buy,I purchased this phone less then 7 days ago. It is humming so bad I can't hear what people are saying on the other end of the phone. I didn't keep the box.
1,Don't expect too much... And don't believe the box!,"I was very excited about this new phone system and all the wonderful features. I waited for weeks, then rush on the internet. Having use it for few days, I am quite deceived:- The sound is so-so, it is sometime hard to understand people talking. Setting it to high make a slight ""hum""- The handset display is nearly unreadable, too bright with too thin fonts.- Setting the phone is quite complicated (as compare to my former Panasonic)- There a lot of frill options, but some other lacking (setting the display light for instance).- At every power failure, the answering machine to be reset (how modern!),- The speakerphone sound is ""humming""So, it is far from the description on the box.I'd rather go for a 5,8 technology and another ... and wished I had buy it at Wal-Mart, so I could return it hassle free. But I didn't."
1,"Nice try, GE","You can spend a whole lot less and get a way better phone.1st problem: I can't hear people on the other end regardless of volume setting.2nd problem: Display is nice and bright, but the LCD doesn't have enough contrast, so you can't see the display.3rd problem: I doesn't display the number of missed calls, you manually need to scroll through the list to see how many were missed.I hope GE will take this piece of work back."
1,Continuous Static,"Until I read these reviews I thought the constant static and occasional dropped sound might be due to a problem with the unit I purchased or perhaps due to some electronics in my office. It has gotten so bad that I only use this phone long enough to walk to my older (but much clearer) Panasonic. If you buy this GE, hold on to your receipt."
2,Display breaks down over time,"I've had my phones for about three years now, and the displays are getting garbled and unreadable. Resetting by pulling the battery does nothing. These are NOT worth the money!"
2,"If you like 1980s technology, you will love this.","The menus are horrible. Next to impossible to navigate. Caller ID takes 15 seconds to show up on the phone. Answering system is VERY odd. Time is hard to set as well. Sound was so-so. I own this item now, but in about 15 min it will be back at the store."
3,May not be the best but it works!,"Despite the bad reviews I decided to keep this phone set and bought two additional expandable units. This thing has bells and whistles I probably will never use like the do not disturb and room monitoring features - but when you break it down to the basics - it rings, it takes and play messages, it's clear, no static - a big plus. I can walk upstairs and downstairs and outside. I had a GE phone set in the past and it was reliable but became outdated as we needed more phones. One thing that does bother me is the loudness of the handset - I can't always hear the caller if I have kids being noisy in the background. It would be nice to be able to turn up the handset volume like you can do on a cell phone. Instead, I need to move to a quieter space then I'm fine. So should you buy it - if you are a risk taker and not very hard to please, go for it. Otherwise, you better keep shopping!"
5,Folk music with a healthy dose of irony,"In Montana a couple of years ago, we had the pleasure of seeing Jack Gladstone perform. This Native American singer-songwriter writes music that is moving, intelligent, and immensely entertaining. His unique take on the history of the great American west ranges from biting satire to social history to gentle nostalgia. Gladstone's albums also include great songs about Native American folklore that are especially appealing to children. Check out Gladstone's music!"
3,work out tank,"Great for working out, but sizes run small. The size I normally wear was a very tight squeeze. Also, it has an underwire bra insert which is a bit uncomforable, i don't remember seeing that in the product description."
1,too much alcohol,This product has too much alcohol and it makes my glasses smudged. I need to wape my glasses with tissues one more time to clear the smudges. :-(
4,great product!,"Streak free. These actually are! Have tried others that claimed to be, but were not. These do what they claim."
2,Lame and cheap...!,"It worked for a while then it killed my shuffle! Cheaply made, it fell apart after a while.Maybe my shuffle die because of me. Don't leave anything plugged into this when starting your car, some cars outputs a spike of energy when starting. This may have killed my shuffle. Or maybe leaving it plugged in charging and listening at the same time. I heard this is not recommended too.So maybe my poor decision killed my shuffle, but it doesn't change the fact that this thing was cheaply made."
2,Limited Usage,"This charger only works for charging iPod Shuffle. It doesn't work for my 30G video iPod with USB iPod connecting cable. There are products out there that cost about the same or a little less but work with all iPods. I wonder why the engineers even bother to make a product with such limitations. :(Here's the message from tech support:Problem: I bought the AVB USB car charger to charge my 30Gig iPod Video by using the USB cable that came with the Video iPod that connects to the charger's USB port. Does it work this way for charging my video iPod? Or is this charger works only with iPod Shuffle?Answer: The AI-03 USB car charger is made for the iPod Shuffle, which has lower power requirements than the standard iPod. To be exact, it has an output of 5 volts, and 400mA.Sincerely,Marcos RoybalAVB Technical SupportTel:562-903-7002 Ext.107MSN Messenger: support@avbusa.com"
4,failed to WOW me,dont get me wrong ...this is a Great game but I really do feel that namco did NOT make good use of the Xbox's power ....perhaps they should call tecmo and get some pointers. I had the first SC on my DC (best fighting game system to date) and that game really WOWd me because I knew that game was a first class effort by namco ....and this is a very bland effort on thier behalf. It is very obvious to me that namco's main focal point is the PS2 and the other 2 ports were just windows of opportunity to make money. It is a real shame that one of the top arcade giants would much prefer to use UNDERPOWERED hardware (system 246 = PS2)to create thier games but hey that's just me
3,could be better,This game was very good but it is to short and lacks a story line really it could have a better story line and better game play but other then that if you like just non stop fighting then this is a great game for you and I suggest buying it.
5,best game in the world,This game is awesome .I like it so much I want to sell my other games.Soul Calibur 2 Rocks hard.
1,"Good Game, But not So good on a Bad Platform","Soul Calibur II is an excellent game, but the Xbox Version, I daresay, is terrible. The special guest, Spawn, is a horrible fighter. Namco could have done better to pick a better guest star for the Xbox.The graphics is way better then that off the Virtua Fighters, the Tekkens, and the Bloody Roar Series, but that is the only good part, and thats why it is worth one star."
2,Great game,"...this game been in the arcade for month, that version is incredible i can only imagine what the home system version is like, if they made it better than the arcade machine as they did for sega dreamcast soul calibur, wich is by far the best game other than halo. 5 stars greatest game of all time up there with chess and foosball."
3,How can you say that Chris Schmell!,"How can you say that the game is awesome when you haven't even seen it yet. Don't you realize that by rating the game so highly before you have actually had a chance to review it, you are in effect, bossting the sales of the game. If the game's sales are boosted inapproporiately, then the manufacturer will think that they created a good game. This means that future games that they create may not be very good because the baseline for criticism was ignorant!! In other words, every review that is unfounded, hurts the quality of the game industry as a whole and keeps better games from coming out! Keep it to yourself if you have no idea!!"
5,"Fast, beautiful and fun","The first of the series on PS was amazing I remember actually trying various techniques until I had finally managed to rip the intro movie and music onto my pc. Then came the second and it took the whole game to a new level keeping the same great playability.This last installement is even better, the XBox simply has the best graphics engine out there. The game is not the most beautiful ever made but for a fighting game it's above norms. The action is fast paced and easy to get into. The controls are simple but the arsenal of special moves will keep you playing and learnign for a long time. The music is perfectly suited and multiplayer fights will keep you glued to your screen from dusk till dawn.It's simply the best fighting game available and the Xbox Port is definatley the best."
2,Same game as Soul calibur 1,"As first I thought this game was alrigtht, then i realized its almost exactly the same damn game as SC1. How can Namco fail to make real improvements on this game when the first SC was for dreamcast, which is a pethetically weak system, compared to Xbox. This just illustrates the fact that all xbox games, save for 1 or 2, fail to utilize the potential that the system hardware provides. Its really sad that i have a game system with a CPU that is powerful enought to support the most sophisticated programs in the world, and no games that are worthy of it."
5,Best Fighting since the original Soul Calibur !!!,"If you like fighting games, you have to buy this game."
4,One of the Better Fighting games for awhile,"REmember how fun streetfighter was now Soul Calibur2...Its a great game to play with friends, Great Graphics and great game play...buttons are not that hard to figure out...but the one player game eventually gets tiring...but other than that I would get this game...plus it is on Plantinum hits for 19 bucks ...you can't go wrong with that price"
4,Awsome Game,"This game has its share of problems for example combo moves are sorta complicated and spawns weapon is a ax for those of you who know how spawn is and what his weapons are but otherwise this game is cool it has awsome graphics, battle system is imensely large millions of new weapons for each character my favorite charactor is Kilic try him out first he him kick some butt and F.W.I look for more of my great opnions on other games. I hope have helped you in your desition."
3,"Decent, however....","I disagree with some who have labled this, a mindless button masher, however, my key dissappointment with this game was that there was too much text to read and not enough areas of animated sequence. For myself, [edited] from ps one still rules the roost. I am surprised that no one has mentioned this great title in the reviews. Part of the fun of each character was watching the video clip at the end. What I liked about [edited] was the different fighting styles. It required a lot of strategy, this game lets you get a lot more slack as a button masher."
4,it's big!,"I bought my yamaha 300 tenor about five years ago. In terms of tone and tuning, I've been very happy with it. You do have to work a little harder to get it in tune for the higher octave, but this has been the case with all of the tenors I've played. The lack of absorbtion can be an issue too. It gets clogged up very easily.Also, do you have small hands? - it is a big instrument. If your hands are small like mine are, you will probably find yourself avoiding middle Cs, C#s, and Fs (or suffering the consequences, as I am currently... ouch). I can only play it for short amounts of time. Some others who have played it haven't any problems in that respect though. But I wouldn't reccomend it for young kids."
1,Not the original recording of title song...,"Actually Keith E. Martin, I have to quibble with you. This WASN'T Murray's original recording of ""Christmas Wishes"". My mother has a holiday compilation album from 1975 which features ""Christmas Wishes"" done in a more acoustic, and to my ears, superior version. I knew it was a re-do the minute I heard it. I wish the 70s version was available on cd, but like the original version of ""Light in the Stable"" by Emmylou Harris which also came out in '75, I suspect the masters have been lost."
1,"did not recieve item,but was charged for it.2nd request to reship the item with no response","product was mailed,but for some reason was returned to shipper.i have asked for you to ship this product to me again,and have not recieved any response from you.we have already been charged for it.please respond to me by email on the status of the product i ordered.james"
1,I will not recommend.,"I bought the phone for my 92 year old mother , but I myself had trouble using it. There is so much buzzing interference sound and for some reason the telephone battery charge seems not staying long . But I just know I did not like the phone myself and the more it will not work with my 92 year old mother who has trouble hearing."
4,Good for older folks,"Bought this for my 83 year old father. It seems to work well, easy to read the displays and numbers, good sound, etc."
2,GE Cordless,"This is a large heavy phone. Thought it would be good for hearing deficit, but only makes it louder, not clear. My old phone works better. Ring is soft. On the plus side, caller ID easy to read, and large buttons easy to use."
2,BIG BUTTON CORDLESS PHONE,"I REALLY DON'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN ANY OTHER PHONES, EXCEPT IT IS VERY HEAVY, AND THE TALK BUTTON IS RIGHT WHERE YOU CAN DISCONNECT IT ACCIDENTLY WITH YOUR CHEEK. WISH I COULD SEND IT BACK"
3,GE Lifestyles Big Button Cordless Phone,"I am hearing impaired.I can hear well while talking on this phone.The one complaint I have is that when it rings the volume ring is low.I set the volume on maximum and I still have a hard time hearing it ring.I tried the different ring tones and still have problems hearing it ring unless I'm right next to it. It doesn't ring very loud.I suspect the ring tone itself has a high pitch, which is part of the problem. This high pitch is in the hearing range most people lose due to age related hearing loss, so I am surprised the phone ringer is in the high pitched range of hearing.The large buttons are a plus.The price for the phone is reasonable.I have been, and continue to be pleased with the quickness of the free shipment by Amazon on their items."
4,GE Big Button Cordless Phone,I purchased this phone for my mother because she frequently didn't hang the phone up after use. This phone has ONE button to turn off and turn on. No more searching for the off button that is usually very small. This large button has solved the problem. Mom enjoys all the larger buttons.The flashing light when the phone rings is great. The volume control button increasing the volume so I can hear her and she can hear me.I think it is a good product for the money.
4,great phone,"This was a great choice for my mother-in-law. She has arthritis and had been having trouble getting up from a sitting position and getting to the phone without having to hurry up before it stopped ringing and then I was also afraid of her falling because she would be in a hurry and lose her balance. The large key pads and large talk button was just what I was looking for. I only had to tell her, just hit the talk button when answering and hanging up the phone and it was large enough that it stood out and she didn't have to try to figure out which button to hit. Great phone for the elderly who get confused with too many choices and too much info."
3,One little hitch,We needed a new cordless phone with enhanced hearing capability and it seems OK for that purpose. But here's the hitch -- when an incoming call rings it lights up and warbles all over the place but at a very low level of sound!!!!! This for a phone we got to hear better!!!! When the TV is on we can just barely hear the phone ring.
1,Never liked it,"I was really excited at first. But, as soon as you walk away from the station, nothing but static. Kept it as long I could stand it because of the price. Should have sent it back. You can do a lot better!"
4,Good cordless for senior citizens,"I bought this product for my 85 year old dad. He has problems hearing on regular phones, but was able to hear clearly with this. It also has large buttons which make it easier to see."
5,Love GE Big Button Cordless Phone,"Purchased phone about a month ago and have really enjoyed using it. It has lived up to it's potential. I'm 70 years old, and can appreciate all the features it offers seniors. Although I am not quite experiencing the hearing loss problems that comes with age yet I do enjoy the ability to see the large readout and use of the big buttons. I highly recommend this product to all ages."
1,Discouragement,"The GE big button telephone is a ""bust"". I purchased two of them and they do not hold an overnight charge. Sometimes the conversation is disconnected with neither of the parties doing the disconnect. I am waiting for approval from ANTonline to return them before I purchase another brand from them. I was very disappointed with this product.GE - Lifestyles Series - Big Button Cordless phone"
1,Unhappy with customer service,"I received my Big Button Cordless Phone damaged. The plastic covering on the antenna was broken off. When I contacted the company, they would only replace it if I paid to ship it back to them. The phone was inexpensive and the shipping would have been one-third of the price of the phone. Would not recommend placing an order with this company."
