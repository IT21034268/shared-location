2,Weak.,"This album got such great customer reviews that I ran out and bought the album. And in two weeks I ran out and returned it.This album is boring at best. It's essentially an exercise in rap/jazz fusion which at this point has been played to death. Unlike the Roots who intertwine every element (voice, dj, live instrumentation) to invent music, People Under... basically have two elements. Rappers over a watery jazz sound. And lyrically, they fare no better. Basically an onslaught of empty metaphors and simile. There is no substance in the words. You've heard it all before.All in all, this album sounds trite now that we are rolling into the new millenium. Hip hop has been around for almost 3 decades now and shouldn't get trapped in 1991."
5,Just good ol' L.A music for bros and hoes!,"Oi, I hafta say, People Under The Stairs abseloutely smacks it again with ""Question In the Form Of An Answer."" Double K and Thes One from West L.A (yes West, not East for once) give you party bag of full flavoured funk, soul and jazz with a hip-hop twist. Round it, it's Hip-Hop in it's purest, most original form. It's not some gangsta flex, but personally I think that's a good thing. The best tunes on the album are Youth Explosion, Blowin Wax, Yehaw Partystyles, Zignaflyinblow, Earth Travelers, The Cat, We'll Be There and all the other tunes are heavy as well.Basically, If your not into good hip-hop like Ugly Duckling, Pharcyde, Lewis Parker etc., Than you shouldn't really buy this...Stick to Nelly, 50 Cent and Eminem. But if your like me and you got good taste, BUY THIS CD, WITHOUT HESITATION.P.S: The Next Step, O.S.T and Or Stay Tuned are all classics as well."
1,TOO FLIMSY,I bought this to replace a Braun travel clock I had for over 25 years.This one just looks and is too fragile to withstand the rigours of travel.. I returned it and found the old Braun which now comes in silver at the same price.
1,NOT AS IDENTIFIED.,"Listing and Amazon invoice read as follows: Seiko Get Up & Glow Travel Alarm - Black - LCD Display. The item is not lighted...there are no LCDs. Note that Amazon has now changed the description somewhat as shown in the ""Item being reviewed"" area to the right of my screen; HOWEVER, there is/are no LCD/LCDs. It's dark and not readable in the dark. NOT EVEN LUMINOUS! As a battery powered travel alarm clock WITHOUT LIGHT, it is not worth $25.50."
2,Need to work on quality,"I bought my Holmes fan about 3 years ago and almost immediately had problems with it. The fan would stop while oscillating and would only start again if I nudged it - like there was a loose connection somewhere. After three years it died completely. I just stripped it down to see if I could fix it but the problem is in the cheezy switch which is a sealed unit that I can't open without destroying it. Power in, no power out :-(Interestingly, the mechanical quality is generally quite good but the electrical is poor. While I was in there I took a look at the oscillating mechanism which uses two plastic cogs that show considerable signs of wear and are very wobbly. Even if the switch hadn't failed I think the oscillating gears would have failed quite soon. Time for a new fan. Why is everything done as cheap as possible? This isn't a cheap fan.At this price it should have lasted longer and had fewer problems."
3,Decent Fan,"I ordered this fan from Grady's, via Amazon. It's a decent fan nicely sized for a desk or a small room. However, it's actual color is a lighter shade of brown than is shown in the photo and Grady's shipment was as slow. That is why I gave the fan only three stars. I've been able to purchase the fan for far less at other sources but had to order through Grady's this time. It is a nice retro looking fan and has been reliable for me."
4,Sturdy and does the job!,"This little desk fan is great for my cube. Keeps me cool when it gets stuffy and looks great too! I didn't want a cheap plastic looking neon green fan like you usually find around the office and this works well. Only thing is the hum is a LITTLE louder than I'd prefer but I don't mind it. It's pretty strong too, but it has 3 speeds which is great. Definitely recommend it!"
3,Educational,A highly eduactional read I enjoyed it simply because it gave me load of info on how to improve my writing
3,"Rola Two Bike Carrier, Hitch Mount",Easy to install in the car hitch and certainly strong enough to carry load. But it does move around a bit in the hitch (side to side) so I will be adding additinal ties. The clamps for the bike tubes are also difficult to clip in place and even more difficult to release. Assembly and operating Instructions are almost useless.
3,white wicker lamp with acrylic drops,My invoice stated that the lamp was new but when the product arrived was old. I had to spray paint the wicker shade white and paint the lamp base. It looks must nicer now. Also the metal prisms were not attached to the order as stated.
2,Save Your Money,The first two reviewers must be the author's uncles. The advice in the book is either standard axiom's found anywhere on the net or half-baked.The previous reviewer said it all -- disappointing.
5,Straight forward book,"As advertised this is a complete course and starts from the entry level. Because of this it can be slow at times if you have read several other books. Well written and understandable as opposed to some books by the ""big names"" who should have someone help them communicate their thoughts. The discussion on odds and the accompanying chart is the best I have seen in over 50 books and makes the topic easy to grasp and remember. Good companion to Lee Jones ""Winning Low Limit Hold'em"" but very different. Though not its focus this book is clearly applicable to all levels of limit and also no limit and tournament."
2,Good protection but you can't see the lights,"This skin does what it's supposed to - protects your iPod shuffle from bangs and scratches BUT fails when it comes to seeing the lights on the shuffle. I bought a clear protector and the black one and have given up with the black one. You can't check the battery life (can't see the back light), you have to take the skin off when you plug it into the USB port (so that you can then see the top light to know when you can & can't unplug it) and you can't see the mode selector to know setting you're onStick to the clear or transparent skin's!"
5,Exceeded expectations,"If you are looking for a different perspective on the art of landscape this is the perfect book. The painters in the Group of Seven are all individuals but have a similar feeling for design and grand compositions. This book has beautiful, large reproductions and it lets the paintings do the talking with over 400 finely reproduced color images. A little expensive but if you love powerfully composed, colorful landscapes, this book is for you."
5,its not just for kids,"i didn't know what this was at first, an art book or a brain twister or a lesson in how color works. it's all three, and i like going over and over through the pages. very beautiful. it's so much more than a kids' book. i've been giving it as gifts since i found it last fall. pay attention, a book can be all of the above."
4,"Okay, I got fooled it was so good!!",How come more game and puzzle books and minds twister books are just not this pretty and this fun? I got fooled by this book a lot. I bought one for my teacher and she liked it alot.
3,Disappointing,"The well-intentioned authors of this book on color illusions tried very hard to produce a book with new artistic examples of some well known and lesser known color illusions.I can imagine their horror when seeing the printed result. The illusions in this book don't really work or they are extremely weak in their effect. This is because the printing of color illusions needs to be very carefully controlled, because they only work within narrow visual constraints. In principle, the illusions they discuss do work, but the published examples in this book will not help you see them well -- I can only guess that a poor printing process that was not properly calibrated with the originals thwarted their attempt.This is a real pity, because it could have been a real contribution to books on illusions, especially since the authors went to some effort to provide brief scientific explanations."
3,"JAZZ, POP & MOR (MIDDLE OF THE ROAD) COMBINED ALL TOGETHER ON THIS 2nd VOLUME OF MOVIE BASED SONGS","As they say 'If it ain't broke...Don't fix it!' well obliviously this worked the first time around, thus resulting in this 2nd installment (Volume 2). You'll either love this or hate it! There is NO in between with this album. Nice for a relaxed evening with a glass of wine and your favorite cheese. No standout cuts to be found...They ALL are pretty easy going tunes."
1,Poorly constructed cd,"I am an avid fan of Mr. Bland's music and have quite a collection; however, this cd is the worse i have ever heard. Who ever composed the material for this cd, should be fired! I have since filed it away never to listen to it again. This is a grave injustice to a wonderful artist. ( Purchased item through amazon.com.)"
1,Memoir or Fiction?,I have to agree with the first reviewer. I was really disgusted by how this book could be considered a memoir. It might be fiction at best. I felt that the authors were just bragging about their ancestors rather than developing their characters to give them the honor they might deserve. How boring and unnecessary for the daughter to include all that history. I rarely ever give up on a book but had to stop when I was a quarter into it. I realized that this was wasting my precious reading time when there are many other books much more worthwhile. This book really rates NO stars!
1,Memoir or Fiction?,I totally agree with the first reviewer. I was disgusted by how this could even be considered a memoir. It was poorly written fiction at best. After reading nearly a quarter of the book I gave up. There was so much unnecessary history included. It seemed like the authors just wanted to brag about their ancestors instead of building up their character to give them the honor they might have deserved. I rarely give up on books but I just didn't want to waste my precious time reading this rambling banter when there are so many other worthwhile books to read. This book really deserves NO stars!
1,Wholesale fabrication,"As the New York Times book review article said ""this book should not be called a memoir but a way a chinese family chooses to see its past"" I also agree with the Times' critic that accused the authors of ""wholesale fabrication"". They insult the readers' intelligence by telling these ludicrous stories."
5,First Class,This book is tremendous. It is meticulously researched and presented in a clear readable style with many photographs to confirm what the author says. The information is sometimes fasinating. At other times it is downright shocking. There is a great deal of important information in this book that Christians need to know.
3,It Kind of Works,"I had to do two treatments in 2 weeks on the rug to get rid of the cat pee smell and to discourage my cat from peeing there again. I even pulled up the rug and put it under it. After about a month or two, I realized that my cat starting peeing on the bottom shelf of the table in the same area. It made him stop peeing on the rug but he found an untreated area to pee on. Since then, I've done 2 treatments on the table and he still pees there. I am going to toss the table obviously. In general, I feel like it wasn't a miracle product. Maybe if I used it as soon as my cat started peeing there it would have been better."
2,"Helps a little, but not effective enough.","I have two male cats and live in a household with a dog. One or both of my cats did not take the adjustment process well and sprayed all over my roommate's antique couch. After trying a couple products from the pet store I decided to give this a shot. I have tried it on both cat urine/spray and vomit stains. It helped in both instances minimally and I followed the directions to the T and treated the areas over and over with no avail. It did not get rid of the spray/urine smell and left a residue when applied to vomit stains on carpet and didn't remove the stain either. For serious odor contamination of feces, vomit or urine I found a commercial grade product that works a lot better. It's called Hydrocide Extreme, Bridgepoint Systems makes it."
4,CAREFUL with GROUT,This worked great at getting cat urine smell off my new tile floor. I was really hoping for the stain removal too. It actually made my beige grout color darker as if a sealant had been used in that area. Hoping I can get it out with an acid cleaner!Be CAREFUL with your GROUT.
4,Stain Remover,I use it a lot. It cleans most stains from my cats. I like that it doesn't leave a smell.
2,Did not work for me,"Followed the instructions on the bottle, using an entire bottle on a 2 x 2 foot area of the carpet. Let it soak for an hour, then set up a fan to dry the area out for 2 days. Smelled just as bad as when I started. Perhaps our situation is unique or the cat urine had set in too much, but I found it to be a waste of money and time for us."
5,best for cat urine,This is the best for cat urine. You may have to get it on your carpet pad if your cat has peed through the carpet though.
3,not sure,"im not sure how well this works really. I havent used it on fresh stains...i had older stains in my beige carpet that i was hoping this would get out. I have cats...several cats...but i make sure to clean boxes ..ALOT..so there isnt really any cat odor in the house. My friends are shocked when they come over. However, i was hoping this would get older stains out from a male that used to love to spray the litter box after using it and got on the carpet. It didnt remove these stains. I can say that it can be put in a steam cleaner...or at least the one i have which is the bissell proheat 2x. There was no excessive foaming or anything like that and i put it on heavy clean. I will have to wait for a fresh mess to determine whether or not i would buy this again since its quite pricey and for what i used it for, regular stain remover/carpet cleaner does the same thing."
5,Great odor illiminator!,"Accidents do happens, even with kitties. And, this product has always been faithful to take away the awful smell of urine. Thanks Nature's Miracle."
5,Really is a miracle!,"I had some messes on which I tried vinegar, baking soda, detergent, and a steam cleaner. This is the only thing that worked. And it's so easy. Just soak of up as much of the original mess as you can, pour some of this on the residue, let soak 15-30 minutes, soak up what you can, and let dry. Smell and stain gone!"
2,Smelled nice - didn't work,"I guess I should have read about this product a little more thoroughly. I didn't realize you had to completely saturate the area with solution. I used up the entire bottle in about 5 minutes. I did the areas where I know my kittens have been soiling the carpet. It smelled nice and the scent seemed to be gone to me, but I don't have a very good sense of smell in the first place. By evening, my cats had already pooped in the areas I had just cleaned. I'm not sure if this is purely behavioral but I am at my wits end."
5,Read this for free,"http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/The Situationist International Text LibraryAn ongoing project of uploading pieces of the wealth of Situationist-related literature. Entire books, lengthy articles, excerpts from the journals Potlatch and Internationale Situationniste, and newspaper articles are just a few of the files to be found here."
5,Helen stands on her own,"Helen Reddy is one of those voices that stand the test of time. She is holding a place of her own in the arena with Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand & Patsy Cline. She has her own style and charm, as a true Diva must have. This collection offers Helen's wide varity of vocal and talent. A must have for those collecting great ladies of song."
4,A More Subdued Wiggles Video,"My 2 year old boy loves the wiggles because of their upbeat singing and dancing skits. Many songs in this video are slower tempo due to the fact that they sing about Jesus and Christmas (which I like). We pick this DVD when it's close to nap time b/c he'll usually cuddle with you on the couch and watch it, which is completely opposite his reaction with other Wiggle videos. Great video on teaching about the real story behind Christmas!"
4,Low budget stuff but great wiggling,We love the Wiggles. This is a lower budget video but great for my 16 month old.
5,"Weird, yet captivating","I had first seen a Wiggles video before I had my daughter and thought they were pretty creepy- yet very energetic. My daughter is now 10 months old and loves this video! She jumps up and down and sways from side to side ""dancing"". ...the Wiggles are oddly fascinating. I still don't understand why Henry the Octopus is plaid, or why Dorothy the Dinosaur wears a hat and has big sharp-looking teeth, but these guys are awesome (and not just because they have matching belt buckles...lol). I cannot get the ""Let's have a dance with Henry"" song out of my head! This is an excellent video."
5,"Well done, includes religious aspects","This is a well done DVD. It includes all sorts of songs and surprisingly some of them are obviously religious. For example, a nativity scene showing Mary with baby Jesus. If you want a secular Christmas DVD, this is not for you.My only problem is that my son is not particularly a Wiggles fan--he prefers Dora the Explorer and Spiderman. But if your child loves the Wiggles, then this DVD is great!"
5,A fun Christmas Video,"There is traditional Chrismtas songs on this video as well as some Wiggle originals which are energetic and fun!Maybe I'm biased being from Australia but these guys are great. My girls love them (1 and 2.5 years)and dance and sing along to their favourite songs. Each song has simple dance moves so that your toddler can easily copy Jeff(Purple Wiggle), Murray (Red Wiggle), Greg (Yellow Wiggle) and Anthony (Blue Wiggle). Captain Feathersword (the friendly Pirate), Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog and Henry the Octopus all feature in this video as well. There is always lots of Wiggle humour thrown in as well which my girls find hiliarious!What I like about The Wiggles is that you can tell that each member is really having a good time - they enjoy what they do, entertaining children and their carers, and this shows through on their videos."
2,NO TITLE,NOT AS GOOD AS THE NEW MOVIES THEY HAVE OUT. SUCH AS THE BIG RED BOAT. NOT AS CREATIVE IN THE OLD SHOWS.
3,Not the best of the Wiggles,"We are a bonafide ""Wiggle Household"". Our children, ages 1 and 3 watch the Wiggles videos two or three times every day! This Christmas video is definitely not as good as our two all-time favorites (Wiggle Time and Toot Toot in the Big Red Car). The tunes are sung slightly out of sync and the choreography and sets look much less professional. I wish it had been better, we're total fans of these guys and want to see a lot more from them."
4,TONY WILLIAMS POUNDS THE SKINS,"AFTER RECORDING SOME SEMINAL ALBUMS WITH THE MILES DAVIS BAND THAT INVENTED JAZZ FUSION MUSIC, TONY WILLIAMS STRUCK OUT ON HIS OWN WITH HIS BAND ""LIFETIME"" IN THE EARLY 70'S. TONY WAS A GREAT YOUNG DRUMMER, AND AT THE FOREFRONT OF DRUMMING IN THIS NEW MODE OF MUSIC, ALONG WITH OTHER DRUMMERS SUCH AS LENNY WHITE, BILLY COBHAM, AND LEON NDUGU CHANCELOR. BUT TONY WAS THE MOST VERSATILE OF THEM ALL, TRULY AN AMAZING MUSICIAN. THIS CD GIVES A GOOD OVERVIEW OF HIS WORK, THE SELECTIONS WERE ALL CHOSEN BY JACK DEJOHNETTE, ONE OF MY FAVORITE DRUMMERS OF ALL TIME AND A CONTEMPORARY OF TONY'S."
1,Horrible Sounding,"These recordings just suck.Shrill,over the top and in desperate need of digital remastering and even then ,I find the material dated and uninteresting.Not a good one."
2,A mediocre TV movie about an aviation legend,"""Pancho Barnes"" stars cute, sweet-as-pie Valerie Bertinelli, and that pretty much sums it up. The ""real"" Pancho Barnes was a hell-raising, homely, tough-as-nails pilot. So while Bertinelli is fun to watch the character she plays is very different from her namesake. As a result this TV movie may have some appeal to viewers as a piece of entertainment, but in the end it is very disappointing. It diverges wildly from Barnes' true-life story after the first 20 minutes or so, and becomes a schmaltzy fair tale. If you're interested in the real story of this lady, check outThe Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club (DVD)or watch the movie ""The Right Stuff""."
3,confusing for studens,"I had to buy and use this book for my CAD class as a beginner in 1997. R12 was nothing like r14 or 2000, but more complex at the time. I liked this step by step instruction with exercises, but most of us were still very confused. Plus, we found more than several mistakes in this book. Another thing is that I just checked the new book,AutoCAD for Interior Design and Space Planning Using 2000 at a book store, but after more than a few years, I still recognized the same drawings in this book. So I agree with one of the reviewers on Beverly L. Kirkpatrick's books that they like to reuse whatever they created in the past....or other books. they are just lazy or what?"
4,Music is back,Speak No Evil is playing music the way it was meant to be played. LOUD & PROUD.A must for any music lover.
5,thank you,"I guess it is ok, I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she hasn't seen it yet so I don't know how she liked it"
5,A title for my review.,"This is a great album. Simple as that. If you've ever seen Kitty Kat Stew on stage you know the dynamic of Damian's keyboard and bass extravaganza, and the explosion of Mia's vocals, complemented by rippin guitar riffs and rockin drums! It's all captured on this album which is a definate must have for your collection!"
4,"Mia, Damien, & the Dans Rule!","For anyone interested in a wholly original and unexpected musical experience, this is the band to check out. From Mia's sexy, sultry pipes to Damien's funky bass to Dan Watson's near prodigal guitar work to Dan Cooke's driving drum beats, one could not go wrong by discovering this strange mix of modern rock sounds and '80s pop sensibilities. Definitely worth picking up. The only thing better (and why this review was tainted from five stars to four) is to check this group out live."
4,I guess you have to be there.,I was lucky enough to see this band live last time they played in Hollywood. They were amazing. So good that I bought their CD. I was really disappointed. It lacks all of the energy that made them so entertaining. I gave them a generouse rating because they are fabulouse live and they have a lot of potential.
2,Not hard rockin' enough,There are some interesting moments on this cd but more than anything it shows an unwillingness to go all the way into the rock genre. Hope they try harder next time.
4,A Kinder Gentler Liszt,These works inspired by various locales in Liszt's travels were written over the course of his life and this particular disc is the third book of compositions by a mature and introspective Liszt composed in the 1870's culminating a series begun in 1836. These are not rousing showstopper's like Mephisto Waltz but require superb pianistic abilities and interpretive sensitivity. Mr. Kocsis was a rather young man in 1986 when these were recorded but obviously deeply talented. Music well worth discovering. Beautifully recorded.
3,Only so-so except for knockout Prince cover Sometimes April!,"The album and her voice do grate a bit, but...worth the price of admission if only for her stunning, Guy Sigworth-produced remake of Prince's ""Sometimes It Snows in April"" from Parade/Under A Cherry Moon - her phrasing, the beat, the strings, the climax...it works and then some. Simply amazing stuff."
4,Four Stars from williamblue.net,"Lawyer's Wit and Wisdom by Bruce M. Nash, Allan Zullo, and Kathryn Zullo presents a small, but interesting collection of quotes about the law from lawyers and others. If you have heard of a quote, chances are it will be reprinted here."
4,Classic music for the 90's,"Now here's a band that will save the deteriorating landscape of rock if they get the chance. Home Sweet Home delivers a sweet little collection of pop/grunge tunes (think of Weezer but different) so catchy and perfectly constructed I was amazed these songs were never written before (Well, okay, ""Up and Down"" seemed like filler, but even that was better than most). Recommended+++"
2,Very inadaquate.,"The text doesn't come close to describing any of the terrain rendering algorithms adequately. For this, the author refers the reader to whitepapers on the companion CD written by the original authors. After a short search on the Internet, I turned up a wealth of better written descriptions on 3d terrain rendering algorithms. I suggest others to do the same.The author makes a big deal out of the importance of morphing vertex points to minimize the effect of popping but provides no implementation description. As he says in the text: ""I didn't want to limit your imagination..."" What a cop out!The c++ code provided on the companion CD is cleanly written, compiled and ran without problems, but is also clean of any useful comments further mystifying the subject. Another search on the Internet turned up many source code examples with better documentation."
3,Not bad,"First of all, Polack's writing style is very annoying. He tries to make his writing ""hip"" by randomly adding in references to pop culture. It just doesn't work. It makes the book harder to read. At worst, his style is insulting.Style aside, the content of the book is not bad. It shows you the main concepts in terrain rendering. Three popular Level of Detail algo's are presented: ROAM, Geomipmapping, and quadtree rendering. The implementation details are pretty much left to the reader (or you can read his code in the CD-ROM). You WILL have to read the terrain whitepapers and understand them (also on the CD).The book is basically for the person who knows a bit about gfx programming (OpenGL, Direct3D, or whatever) and wants to get his/her feet wet in terrain rendering.If you have already read the geomipmapping whitepaper and understand its concept, you will find this book useless."
1,Not so good.,"I bought 1 in GDC this year(2003).This book is terriable!If you see through the code, there are lots of mistakes in it.Some serious C++ programming problems you can also find in the code.Sometimes, I want to figure out what did Trent try to say, I seek code fragments for help, but It only drives me crazy to fix up all errors he had made.But thanks that, I get better understanding. :-)Maybe I'm too strict with a teenager arthur, but before place your order, you've better to know that!"
2,"It should be called ""Stories about terrain for teenagers""","I am beginner to terrain programming but:If you want to learn how to load heightmap or to generate it, this book is for you. If you want to learn something about algorithms, you would bless whitepapers after reading that. Trents explanations on algorithms are kind of:""Phew! That's a lot of pseudo-code and lot of ugly little bit shifting/masking ops! Well, never fear. It's all a lot simpler than it looks."" - explanation to extremely hard to understand code (a lot of k,cx,ix, (index==0?1:-1)&3 type of code, etc)Style of this book gives me idea that it was written for about 15-year old teenagers, his jokes are even not funny at all. (about 10% of book are his jokes)Code is pretty slow and he USES OPENGL, making his programs completly useless for game developers. I'm really disapointed wasting my money. I gave 2 stars because now I know few ways for generating heightmaps and for whitepapers available to download for free from elsewhere..."
3,Uses OpenGL,"I bought this book thinking it would uses DirectX but it uses OpenGL. Also, the demos run very slowly. No use of index buffers. I was pretty disappointed."
4,Good start for a young star,"After my first listen to the Rachel Leep Band's debut disc ""Wanting More""; I was shocked to discover that the band leader Rachel is only 17 years old. I am pleasantly suprised to have stumbled upon this talent long before the rest of the world will. Leep's vocals immediately bring to mind Margo Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies and Sara Mclaughlin. My suprise was compounded when I noted that all songs on the disc are written by Rachel Leep. Leep plays the piano and is backed by a two piece band: guitar and percussion. Although the production is somewhat than perfect; all-in-all it is a very good debut. I look forward to tracing the evolution of this artist's career because the first disc has left me....""Wanting More."""
2,BAD REBATE PROGRAM,"I brought a air filter & a oil filter as a promo for a rebate, They rejected my rebate because I have a PO BOX rather then a address. Since our town does not have mail carriers in the village people have Postal Boxes. They said they will not send rebates to PO BOXES, but funny thing I had to send the rebate to there PO Box. I will never buy a Fram product again & will dis courage others from buying there products if they have to be that CHEAP!!!!!"
1,not right oil filter,This is not the right oil filter for 2007 dodge with 5.9 diesel.It might work for gas motor.The diesel filter is longer.
5,Terrific! Highly inventive!,This is one of the most creative and entertaining worlds I've seen outside of hard SF. This is the best Turtledove book I've read to date.
5,I Loved This Book!,"Wonderfully entertaining. Plus, this book is instructive of ancient peoples' relationships with their gods. While you may not find the physical form these gods take believable, they do represent a power inherent in nature that ancient peoples found divine.I could wish, however, for a different ending in which Engibil is defeated!"
1,No flash No fire No fun,This book is a total waste of a reader's most valued comodity: time. Don't bother. This author is way out of his league.
3,Good enough to stop boredom.,"There wasn't enough big-scale battles in this book. This is a personal requirement for me. I also wish this novel was set in the Iron Age not Bronze Age. And by the way, how could anyone be so stupid as to place their godly powers into a single item then neglect to guard it?"
4,It was alright,"Welcome to the Dawn of the Bronze age!! God's rule the world, demons cause illness and your dead relatives can talk to you. Very fun book, really like it and I wish Harry would have continued to write books in this universe. There is of course what I have dubbed THE TURTLEDOVE FACTOR(Sex for no reason at all). However barring that this is still a very good book. I particularly liked the ghost of the grandfatherOverall-Just fun fanstay, however I didn't like the habit the characters had of saying everything twice, lots of redundant dialogue."
2,Yawn,"The first Harry Turtledove I've read (maybe the last) - I kept waiting for something to happen, but the story just peters out. If you cut out the re-iterations of each phrase in praise of the gods by each person and each echo of the other person's greeting, the book would be half its size. Sadly disappointed."
2,98 of the whitest women in the world,"Hegre has some amazing skills and amazing talent working for him, but unfortunetly not much of either is shown here. Even the breathtaking Marketa looks undirected and bored beyond belief. Save the money and take a free tour of his website. You will get better quality."
3,For for Fileting,"100 Girls. I like 100 Years by FFF better. Out of this collage I preferred, or flagged about 6 or less pics. Granted in another's opinion, one may prefer 38. It's just on what you visually prefer. This item will be kept as the book and pics are well put together. Happy Viewing."
2,100 Naked Girls,"I got the book for my boyfriend and he honestly hasn't even looked at it, just flipped through. I looked at it though and just thought it was cheesy. The girls all look the same and they just aren't very sexy. I was disappointed. Poo"
4,DIFFERENT & REAL.,"Norwegian photographer Petter Hegre has done an admirable job with this very different book of photos. It has 192 pages, the pictures are divided into mini-chapters for each model is listed alphabetically, & most of the photos are inside apartment settings. These pictures are of real women in realistic situations, poses, & environments.The photographs are done to show the natural character of the model, & many are truly stunning in their natural sensuality. The women featured are generally unaltered, as in no touchups. He successfully attempts to take pictures from their best angles, he does not hide or cover moles, freckles, or anything else that is so often covered up in modern photography using models. These women are presented as they are, not by some unheard of perfectionist myth. I will deduct 1 star because Asian, Black, short, & overweight women were left out, & some of the portraits were too small to show the models at their best."
4,Decent Photos,"I was basically looking for a book with good looking women taking in a professional manner. I liked this book. although the subjects are not professional models, they looked good and the pictures are of high quality."
5,Great Resource,I've been running a DNS server for quite a while (and quite improperly as I found out). This book has been a major help in straightening out my DNS server. Very good reference!
5,Incredible Multichannel sound...worth every peny!,"Excellent album, will go down in history as one of the greatest. The multichannel DVD-A is phenomenal, with it's 48kHz/24bit encoding. I don't see how 96kHz could be any better, this recording is crystal clear and well separated. Worth the price of admission? Absolutely!!!"
5,The best version of a great album,wonderful product / the best sounding version of one of the classic albums of all time. Well worth the money.
4,The Winans go All Out,"This is another classic Winans CD, you know the songs and even though their sound is different from the 1st four albums, its still great. With Pastor Marvin, Carvin, Mike, and the late Ronald, you can't go wrong. Great cd, by the quartet."
1,ALWAYS OUT OF STOCK WHAT THE HECK??????????,Twice now and I said nothing the first time but now I am. WHY POST IT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE IT???????????????????
1,"BEWARE, 6.8 does NOT mean 6.8pcf like you would expect","The queen size version of this 4"" topper weighs 38lbs.In other words, it has a 3.4 pound per cubic foot density. Not a 6.8pcf density like the name implies.Nowhere in the description do they state what the 6.8 actually means. It is NOT the foam density in pounds per cubic foot like most other memory foam products use.Edit: I am reducing my rating to 1-star. After just a few months this pad is noticeably degraded and less supportive. Not only was it squishier than the advertising implied to begin with, but it is already wearing out in less than six months. There is no nice way to say this: it's crap."
4,Minolta XTsi,This is a good camera. Many features for the price. I bought it to replace a Minolta 5000i that died after 10 years. The camera is much lighter than the 5000i. It almost feels delicate but has held up well so far. The autofocus is much improved and will work in situations where the 5000i was confused. I thought the eye start animation would be a nuisance but it is great for travel. The only feature I don't like is the auto pop up flash which pops up even in bright sunlight. The Auto pop up flash and the eye start animation can be quickly disabled. The manual features are much more complete than the 5000i. The spot metering is also a great feature. This camera just about does it all and is a great buy.
4,"Afro-pop with bits of disco, doo-wop, madrigal, Arab lament.","Wide variety of styles for sweet African voices, all distinct from one another. Most songs draw on Afro-pop, but they capture bits of disco, doo-wop, madrigal, and Arab lament. Some are more sound effects than songs. Some are static chants without real lyrics. One or two are too sweet. The closest parallel is Sweet Honey in the Rock, but Zap Mama is uniformly happier, lighter, even on Apartheid songs. Sample of variety: tr 1-Mupepe (closest to ethnographic); tr 6-Plekete (closest to Bobs); tr 9-Din din (sounds like a madrigal); tr 11-Guzophela (South African doo-wop). Stand-outs: tr 5-Take me CoCo. tr 13-Marie-Josée (classic polyrhythmic, sweet Afro-pop). tr 14-Ndje Mukanie (Afro-pop rich and smooth as herbed honey)."
4,Original and Polished,"Zap Mama's Adventures in Afropea is new, original, yet polished. The a capella style is delightful and rich. The concept (European/African fusion) works effectively. If one likes modern a capella music, this is a good edition to an eclectic collection."
3,"Poorly written, but an interesting story.","This book could have benefited from better editing- it has a lot of typos, some incomplete sentences, and at one point two paragraphs are repeated almost word-for-word in two different chapters. It is, however, an interesting case study of an exceptionally gifted child and the family who raised him. Parents seeking advice from other parents of gifted children might find this book hard to put down, but I think they could find better resources by starting with ""Smart Boys"" or ""Smart Girls"" by Barbara Kerr, or the books ""Re-forming Gifted Education"" and ""Stand Up for Your Gifted Child."""
1,Sad...,"This is one of the worst books on giftedness I've ever read. I bought the book thinking I would learn something about acceleration. What I got was nothing but a sad tale of a dysfunctional family whose mother is completely obsessed with her son's intelligence and her rationalizations for why she kept pushing him. Everything in their life is put on hold and everything in their life is sacrificed for the education of this ONE child. I'm sure Michael believes the world revolves around him -his family certainly believes it...and they don't do anything to teach him any different. Sadly for Michael, life only revolved around him,his education and his intelligence. He never experienced what it was like to be part of a family where EVERYONE was valued for who they are...not just their intelligence."
5,The Dictionary on Color and Color Theory,"This is the most comprehensive book I've seen to date on the topic of color. The discussion, examples, exercises and demonstrations are all first rate. This book should be added to any artist's library, regardless of medium."
2,more for the Water colour painter,This book has a few good ideas but it is very biased towards water colours.
2,Exploring Color,A lot has already been written on color by better artists so save your money. A color wheel and some practise will teach any artist all they need to know. Paint the three primary colors and explore for a fraction of the cost.
4,Don't leave home without it...,Ever since the first Swiss Army knife I owned I just have to have one in my pocket. I like the smallest ones and while this one is a little thicker due to the flash drive it's very compact and I don't have to carry a separate flash drive which i also like to keep in my pocket to keep private and vital data safe. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it comes with an integrated pen that I could live without but not a tooth pick and tweezers which I consider a big part of why I want this in my pocket. With a little ingenuity it's possible to switch the faceplate containing the pen out for one from my other Swiss pocket knife that has the tooth pick. I like the small LED more than the tweezers so the light stays. Transfer speed isn't the fastest I've seen but it's acceptable.
5,Really like it!,"I got this item for Christmas, and I really like it. My wife said that she wishes that it was a little bigger, but knew the measurements when she ordered it. Its very convenient because we travel a lot and the memory stick separates from the knife part."
2,Great tool when it works,"I primarily purchased this for the flash drive component. It replaced a 1GB swissmemory I'd returned because the pen portion broke off (yes, I actually used it, too!) and I needed the larger capacity. Well, when I got this new one, the flash drive seemed a little slower. 6 months later, it died. Completely. All my data is gone. Granted, I backed up what I needed, but I'd expect this to last longer than 6 months. Also, the price - you can buy a new 2GB flash drive for $20 now, and the silver alox version of the swiss army portion of the tool only costs another $20... even adding a courtesy $20 for the convenience of having the two-in-one, that only puts it at $60, half of what it's going for here. Not the best deal, but it's still a cool tool."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I felt that the author was quite judgemental of different people's types of commitments. I follow the Reclaiming Pagan/Wiccan tradition, & I believe that this type of book is too snobbish to have any relevance to an eco-feminist tradition."
5,Handfasted and Heartjoined hits the right notes,"This book is of particular interest to any pagans who are in the process of creating a meaningful ritual for their marriages, particularly if both parties in the marriage are pagan, or at least one is pagan and the other is pagan-leaning. The book is well-written, and explains the purpose and history of handfasting, with particular focus on the meaning and significance of the ritual. I would recommend it to any pagan couple that wants a meaningful ritual to mark their union."
3,"Helpful, but take some of it with a grain of salt.","As Shonna Rhein pointed out, the book was obviously biased and lacking in some aspects. Pagan-to-non-Pagan marriages do certainly work out, and solitary practitioners are just as much a witch as those who are coven-initiated.That said, I did find the book was helpful in planning my ceremony and writing vows."
1,Size?????,"The size was a toddler sizing, so I assumed it ment a child below 4 years old. To be sure I called Amazon, the person that ansered the phone said that their shoe sizing information was not very good and that he could not help me with it. So I ordered the shoe in a size 4 thinking it was for a toddler as it said. When I received the shoes they wewe more like a big kids or adult size. The shoes themself were very nice, well built. I just hope they are still in style when she grows into them. She is 3 years old now. Also some of the shoes I was looking at went by clothing size, not shoe size."
1,Didn't work for me,"First of all, I'm 64 years old and have never used HRT; have been using NOW Indole-3-carbinol for several months with great success in overcoming symptoms of Estrogen Dominance (bloating, water retention, insomnia). Tried this Calcium D-Glucarate after reading that it aids in ridding the body of xenoestrogens and took it along with the I3C. I started out with 2 tablets per day (1000 mgs) with no apparent results, then went up to 4 tablets. Symptoms returned with water weight gain, a very bloated belly and trouble staying asleep. I discontinued use and within a couple of days those problems were gone. Indole-3-carbinol and DIM enhance ""good"" estrogen production, while getting rid of the harmful ones. Think in my case the Calcium D-glucarate got rid of the good stuff and left me with symptoms of too little estrogen, which are a lot like estrogen dominance. I base my one-star rating solely on my experience with this product. It may work just fine for others."
5,Great product,I love this product. I think it helps men lower their estrogen levels and I will buy more in the future. Thanks.
3,Not Capsules!,I bought these to help bring my testerone levels down along with fiber. These are tablets and I had previously been using capsules and changing to tablets effected the way my body felt as it took longer for my body to absorb tablets. I will be ordering capsules next time. Nothing against the seller or product just not what I needed.
5,Not as good as manic but close,"I give it a 4.5 or 4.3 after the first listen i loved then it wore on me a bit manic is the better one this goes into more progressive ground then manic but still some killer tracks on from sound the alarm my personal fave by the band to driven it seems to stall a bit the middle but then it picks up agian, go get it if ya like metal with a twist."
4,amazing technical metal!,"Anacrusis probably hasn't gotten the attention they deserve for their prominent role in the turn-of-the-decade technical speed/thrash/death movement (along with other bands like Mekong Delta, Believer, Cynic, Tourniquet, Atheist, etc.). ""Screams and Whispers"" is one of the catchiest of the technical metal albums out there; it lacks the grey uniformity of their prior works as well. Anacrusis' vocals are as always interesting, alternating between a cool mid-range vocal and a high-pitched squeal. All in all, a fine way for them to end their career. It's a shame, however, that they packed up shop: they might have done even better things had they continued.High 4 rating."
4,totally original band very off beat but creative,this band was introduced to me by way of overkill horrscope tour they open for overkill not overly impressed at first by the end of the show i was mildly impressed over the next week i found my self stuck on a few songs of theirs i could remember and had to purchase there cd's.after a few months this cd was release and yet again i was surpised by their originalty and catchiness.they may have something in compareision to powermad or believer but mostly they are nothing like anyone else.
5,Great Macro and Portrait lens.,"I have these lens for over a year now and I am really impressed by the quality of the pictures I get with it.The lens are sharp, and have great bokeh for out of focus subjects. The AF speed is a bit slow when you are shooting Macro - but the same goes for the Nikkor 105 VR micro. For portrait shoots the AF speed is quite good, especially when you limit the AF switch to focus on subjects not in Macro mode. I see no reason to buy the Nikkor/Canon lens unless you have to due to camera constrains (like if you have the D40/60).These are great lens and you won't be sorry for getting them.I cannot say anything bad about them."
3,Maybe a great Macro but not a Portrait lens,"After reading many great reviews i purchased this lens for portraits and relaised its not meant for it. It may be a good macro lens, which i did not attempt, but certainly not a portrait lens. The depth of field at f2.8 was okay but lacked sharpness. I read about many prime portrait lens having decent sharpness at wide open aperture but this was way low. Also the focal point was always behind the selected features. When focused on eyes with a D300, i was getting focused ears. The focusing speed is also slow. I don't know if i got a defective piece but i returned it to Amazon and was quickly provided a refund without any hassle. Will try Nikon 85mm"
3,Sharp lens with slow motor,"I like this lens, and have taken some great shots of my son and flowers. The lens is very sharp, and the clutch focus is a nice feature. I use this with my Nikon D80.My biggest gripe is the focus is very slow. Sometimes, in lower light, it won't find the focus. Also, it wasn't clear to me when I purchased it, but the F/2.8 is only when focused at infinity. When doing a 1:1 macro shot, it is limited to F/4."
3,An OK macro lens,"This lens while a good lens is slightly over rated. I bought mine locally in Sydney about 5-months ago and am currently looking to replace it with either a Nikon 105 f2.8G ED VR macro or a Sigma 105 f2.8 OS HSM Ex lend. I am just not getting the sharpness everyone claims with the Tamron. The AF is clunky and constantly hunts and I dislike the clutch mechanism on the barrel to switch between AF and manual. On the plus side colours are good, it's lightweight and seems to be of good quality. I don't believe that this lens is as good as what everyone claims."
3,The Ethics Of Authenticity,"For non-native English speaker, the language is rather complex. Thus providing a learning experience in that too. Excellent book, assumes the reader has at least some basic understanding of philosphical phenomena and theories. For a business executives: Do not take it for speed-reading, the more time you spend with the book the more you get out of it.Very good and concise presentation of the topic, I also found several thinking patterns and models that are labelled differently in managemen/leadership books. Taylor gives great points for the future leaders, leaders of generation Y (or generation C, ""C"" standing for communities like the numerous virtual networks in internet).This book helps You think, it doesn't give specific answers or ""think it for You""!Thinking doesn't hurt. :-)"
2,Highly academic,"This book was highly academic, barely practical and ill-fitting to my intentions for buying it. Disappointed."
2,Tate & Lyle Golden Syrup,"Ordered 2 cans, previously had ordered this in squeeze bottle (which is preferred & much better). One can was leaking at the seam on the bottom and the other dented!!! Contents in can do not taste as good as in the squeeze bottle. I taste metal in the can version. Wonderful taste I remember from child hood, but the can version sucks........."
3,not what i expected,I had learned about this product after looking at recepies that called for it. I have used it in those recepies but the taste isn't something I love or would lather onto toast but then i didn't grow up with it as the folks in England did so it's not really my cup of tea.
5,Chewy gooey Scones,Nothing better than scones. The are delicious and Lyle's Golden Syrup whips up the best tasting scones. Try 'em sometime.
5,A taste of england at home,"Was happy to get the tin of golden syrup. I am able to find the squeeze bottles at the store, but the tin has a charm to it that will be used for other purposes in the future."
5,GREAT FOR BAKING,"I used this years ago when I lived in Europe and tried it again recently when I found it on Amazon. It adds a wonderful molasses taste in recipes calling for corn syrup, like pecan bars and chocolate frosting. It's a hit with my friends. One likes oatmeal now with a spoonful of the syrup."
3,Lilliputian,"First off, Lyle's Golden Syrup is unbelievably delicious. This size tin, 454g, is pretty tiny; it translates into about 1.5 cups or about 12 U.S. fluid ounces. This wasn't obvious online and so I got a tin that was quite a bit smaller than what I was expecting, so I thought it was too pricey. (Another seller on this site states that each tin is 16 fluid ounces, but those must be British fluid ounces which [I just learned] are smaller than U.S. fluid oz. England is revenged.)"
5,Buttery Goodness,"I'm a big fan of natural, raw honey, so when I saw this product I didn't think too much of it, but bought it because I like trying new things. I don't care for maple syrup much, too sweet for my taste, so I was hoping this would be a substitute for that on pancakes/waffles.The texture/thickness is exactly like honey, so it pours slowly and thickly, making it a lot like honey in this way as well. It doesn't seem to granulate like honey, though, which I'm glad for.Then I tasted it.....OMG it's sooo good!!! Very light and sweet, not 'sugary' at all, but buttery goodness!!! This has become my favorite liquid type sweetener, even over honey, although I don't think I'd use this in tea, only on foods that call for syrup, since I would think the buttery flavor might get lost in a hot liquid.I purchased mine at Sendik's in Milwaukee. So glad they carry it! Worth every penny!"
5,"KORN ""N' THE KOB ARE BACK! SORT OF.","BRIAN WELCH WAS ACUALLY IN THIS BEFORE HE WAS RELEASED. THE BACK COVER MIGHT SAY 2006 BUT IT ALSO SAYS THESE TRACKS WHERE MADE 2 YEARS BACK YEP, 2004! WHO CARES, THOUGH YOU WON'T FIND ANY SYOTOS TRACKS HERE BUT YOU'LL FIND THE OLD SCHOOL KORN MUSICE HERE JUST HARDER LIVE! ALSO INCLUDES SPECIAL RARE TRACKS LIKE ""PROUD"", ""ONE"", ""EARACHE MY EYE"", & ""ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL""! WELP, NOW ITS YOUR CHOICE TO GET THIS, IT'S YOUR BIG CHANCE TO HEAR BRIAN AGAIN!"
2,so-so,"The following can be said about this album...rare?All of you who are contemplating the purchase of this album should look the other way. Chances are you already have all of these songs (except maybe Proud). A final thought would be this, 'rare' doesn't even describe the album cover. Turn it 90 degrees counterclock-wise....ever seen George Romero's ""Land of the Dead""?"
1,They dont know what else to do......,"This has to be another effort to be alive on the music industry. The live performance is the same one that come with the DVD from Greatest Hits Part 1. They add ""new tracks"" as Proud which is on the soundtrack of the movie I know what you did last summer. Earache my eye its the last song from Follow the leader but live. One is from the tribute to Metallica. If all that is ""rare"" they are really desperate for money.Dont buy this CD buy the new tool Cd which is way better."
5,It's Korn,Yeah I agree with the last comment theres nothing rare about this album....Proud from the movie I know what you did last summer....earach my eye frollow leader (bonus track)....Another brick n the wall Gre Hits....One take a look n the mirror....However it's damn good live album good quality sound great for subs n your car....It's the same recording from the bonus dvd that you get when you buy take a look n the mirror for those didnt realize that....So if your die hard fan I suggest you get it add to your collection....New to korn even better actually it's like a greatest hits but live pretty much so buy peeps.....
3,Good album from Korn.,"Reason why I say good album is because they didn't put enough tracks in like ""Good God"", ""Dead Bodies Everywhere"", ""Ball Tongue"", ""Dirty"", ""Beg For Me"", ""Wake Up"", ""Wake Up Hate"" ""Embrace"", ""Thoughtless"", ""I'm Hiding"", ""Shoots & Ladders"", ""Need To"", ""Clown"", ""Divine"", ""Helmet In The Bush"", ""Mr. Rogers"", ""Lost"", ""Twist"", ""Chi"", ""Daddy"", ""Justin"", ""Seed"", ""Its on"", ""Reclaim My Place"", ""Counting"", ""Hollow Life"", ""Counting On Me"" ""Alive"", ""When Will This End"", & ""Y'all Want A Single""! This live joint doesn't top Slipknots 9.0 live album at all & certainly doesn't have rare tracks except maybe just ""Proud"" from LIP & thats about it. theres no ""Camel Song"" on here & ""Earache My Eye"" & ""One"" are not really rare tracks. This should of been 3 in a half stars because their is a lot of live tracks missing & not enough rare tracks in it! But its an okay cd but it wouldn't be held for long."
2,Nope,"Not gonna buy this one. A Korn:Live cd would have been cool by itself. A Korn:Rare Tracks cd would have been even better. But why the hail would they include one of the few rare songs(Proud) on this? I mean Hail, you make a Live or you make a Rare. Or even better you make both. Not this poorly put together compilation but a double disk--one live cd and the rare tracks one. The live stuff on this looks fine but you need the other rare cd with Camel Song, I can't Remember, Sean Olson, Jingle Balls, Kick The P.A., and any other locked-up slop that's rotting in the vaults. I know, I know, there are money issues involved. Just release them separately and rake in more cash."
5,This book is a treasure.,"I have read The Divine Vision of Radha Krishn twice now. It is so full of information for my mind and consolation for my heart, that I will be reading it again and again. And each time I will gain new insight into what had previously been very confusing to me: namely, the many aspects of Hinduism which seemed contradictory. After reading The Divine Vision of Radha Krishn, these philosophies are reconciled and clear. This book is a treasure."
5,The Divine Vision of Radha Krishn,"Of all the many books I have read on spiritually, religions and philosophies of the world, by far this book is the most profound. I can not say anything meaningful to describe this book, only can I express a deep sence of awe and gratitude. Hinduism is a great and boundless philosophy. For the most part, it is totally misunderstood. H.D. Swami Prakashanand Saraswati expounds on its totality in only 438 pages with a beautiful style and simplicity. This book, however, not for light reading, is extremely easy to read with clear concise sentences. It has a large index and glossary for those wanting to truly study this subject. On a scale of one to ten, this book is simply beyond, beyond."
2,Surprised and disappointed,"I've been a Michael Franks fan since I first heard ""Popsicle Toes"" on AM radio back in 1975, and for the record own five of his albums on vinyl and four on CD. I purchased Dragonfly Summer based on the reviews posted, and, quite frankly, because of the number of 5-star reviews, was EXTREMELY disappointed. Multiple listenings, over two different headphones setups, and on the big sound system in the living room through very good speakers didn't change my opinion. While this IS decent Franks music, it does not compare favorably to earlier works like The Art Of Tea, Sleeping Gypsy, and Tiger In The Rain, or his recent Watching The Snow. If you're considering beginning a relationship with this fine artist, I suggest you start with The Art Of Tea, and put Dragonfly Summer on the long list."
5,Kick A**!!!,"The second album from this Seattle thrash outfit is even better than their debut. The production on this record is incredible. The drum sound is phenominal. Concise, catchy, powerful, and well crafted songs is what this album is about. Crank it up!!"
1,Standard Motor Products Horn,"This review is more on the vendor rather than the product itself. The reason I originally bought this product was because of the type of connection the horn has, which is what I needed for my vehicle. I was quite disappointed because the company was not able to provide the correct horn. I'm sure the horn is a quality horn and works quite well, but it doesn't do anybody any good if the product that is sent out is not the same one pictured on the inventory list. If an item has a picture associated with it, I expect to receive the item that is like it. This particular vendor was not able to do so."
1,it not accurate at all.why this people make this kind of junk.,you dont want a buy this junk.. so f junk.regreat ..dont even trying to put this item in your cart.
2,Usually happy,"Well I got this in yesterday and it worked fine when I first opened it but after about 30 minutes of use the LCD display crapped out. I called AWS and they gave me a return authorization but with the 7 dollar price tag I would pay more for the shipping it back to the company than ordering a new one. I will not be ordering another one either though. It was a gamble for the price and would tell you the same. Ordering this item is going to be a gamble. It may work great for you I don't know, all I know is mine failed pretty fast..."
3,Meh,"Came on time and as it was advertised. The problem with it is that its off by like .2 grams. Its very inconsistent. I just bought the weights to calibrate it, so we'll see how it works after being calibrated. But for the price, I guess its ok. I wasnt expecting much."
2,cheap,"albeit, it was cheap. but being cheap, it wasn't too accurate. I got several different readings on the same item placed on the scale. If you want a cheap scale, try getting a manual one, they won't give you as incorrect readings."
3,Item details were not correct,"Item details were not correct, and it cam with the wrong size weight to calibrate it. You need a 500g weight and the included weight is only 100."
4,Nutrition scale,"More than accurate for my use, small enough to keep handy and easy to use. I would recommend for many uses."
4,Nice,"Accurate, sturdy, nicely made. Integrated lid to keep it protected. Buttons seem like they will last. Comparable to the $100+ models."
4,Nice,This kit gives you what you need to find the gold. I suggest this kit for beginners and advanced gold prospectors.
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good scale, it needs to be calibrated once you just need to calibrate it once you get it; It will ask for something that weighs 500Grams, a full water bottle works just fine for this. All in all, a good buy."
2,"Questionable accuracy, not very durable","From reviews I've read on other sites, there seem to be a lot of these that are lemons -- but if you get one that works, it's a great scale for the price. The scale I got gave me inconsistent readings and broke after about 2 months."
3,Okay,Have to keep turning it on and off for it to work accurately. Which is kind of a pain when you are measuring protein.
5,Perfect to weight small amounts of food,I love this product it is easy to use and store in a safe place where my daughter wont touch it.
4,Worth every penny,Thios is a great little device for a compact scale design. Priced right and functions quite nicely. Be sure to get yourself a calibration weight to calibrate the scale after you get it.
1,you get what you pay for,This scale failed to work properly within a few weeks. It was not mishandled or dropped. I put new batteries in it-----still did not work correctly. Its not worth sending back.
4,Good Buy,I have this scale for a while now and it works good. I do recommend because it last and durable
1,Shouldn't have got.,It is very inconsistent at weighing things. When empty it will give a false weight of negative 2 grams! And it won't weigh anything with any accuracy at all. Don't waste your time/money on this.
5,cool for silver and gold,Great for the price. The batterys die very quick and if you screw with the settings like i did then it will not be calibrated right and the only way to do thisbis with a 500gram weight. And no local stores carry that and it aint laying around the house. Besides that coo beans
5,American 600 Gram Jewelry Scale,"THIS IS NOT A TOY! Weighs Gold, Silver and any other jewelry, and you can adjust for Troy oz, gram, etc...over 5 settings. Perfect for weighing jewelry that I am preparing to sell on Ebay. Bought one for my sister too."
1,Don't buy this scale... Unless you're really broke,"When it was working it was flaky. It would weigh the exact same thing out differently . (Margin for error was about .2 of a gram for every 5 grams on the scale.) After just a few uses, It said the batteries were dead. (came with some cheap generic chinese batteries) When I opened up the compartment, one of said batteries had been leaking battery acid all over the inside of the scale. Needless to say all the metal parts were rusted out and it never turned on again. BUYER BEWARE THIS IS A SUB PAR PRODUCT."
1,Disappointed,"Just received my scales (10/13/10) and my first observation was that the insides were all scratched up. This was obviously a used unit that was repackaged and sold as new. Then after turning on the unit, the digital readout would not stabilize on 0 or any numbers. In fact, the numbers were not numbers at all, the digital readout was defective. Also, the scale would turn off after about 3 seconds and would not stay on. The unit was packaged perfectly and there was no shipping damage. I will have to return them for a refund and take my chances elsewhere."
3,coo for the price...,as soon as It got here I weighed a nickel and it was jump from 4.9-5.2 mostly 5.2 we all know it's supposed to weigh 5g... so I weighed out exactly 500g on my other working scale and calibrated this one... and I got similar results... the quality is cheap but I'm happy they went with a steel base instead of plastic... ohhh and I had to break the door so I can use it as a tare tray if it came with a tray I would have gave it another star...
4,Too EASY!,"No more using a postal scale or a bullet loading grain scale. Setting up the balance beam is out. Push the on button, the tare button and throw it on. Works great! (Cheap too!)"
3,Meh....,"You get EXACTLY what you pay for, a complete piece of crap, this scale is dodgy for anything under 10grams."
5,Nutrition has never been easier,"Very nice home scale for easy and accurate measuring. They do not include a weight for you to calibrate, so if you need extremely accurate measurements, you need to invest in a 500 gram weight for calibration."
1,Not worth it,I thought that the three sequences in the DVD would be instructing the viewer on how each session progresses but instead this DVD was more about showing different techniques and not a breakdown of how each session progresses.If I wanted to buy a product that only showed techniques then I would have purchased one of the many books out there with pictures of the various strokes/techniques.I wish this DVD would have taken the route of the Chair Massage DVD which showed the techniques and later how a session progresses step by step.I was very disappointed with this purchase.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THIS DVD MIGHT BE O.K IF YOU'RE NEW TO SWEDISH MASSAGE, BUT IF YOU ATTENDED SCHOOL THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY."
4,great dvd!,This dvd is very informative great camera shots to see hand movement/placement breaks it down into sections I would highly recommend it!
4,"brilliant, a tour de force","This work lays to rest previous so called histories of the city...Richie has shown that it is still possible to write a comprehensive history that attempts to connect between different aspects of life and culture...a recommended book for anyone interested not just in Berlin, but in the development of the modern metropolis."
2,Extremely biased and vague at crucial points,"This book may be entertaining, but there are many places where Ritchie simply ignores information that would conflict with the right-ist argument she wishes to make about the outcome of the cold war. She somehow knows better than all of the politicians who participated in the actual events (e.g., terming Roosevelt's decisions during the yalta conference ""criminally ignorant""). Her presentation of the East German situation is so far right that even I (a moderate) would say that it borders on tendentious. And she makes a number of egregious errors in German. Not worth the money, even at the discounted price it's being offered at now."
5,A Monumental Achievement! History as a page turner!,"Don't be daunted by the length of this book. Ms Richie offers us a compelling and often, absolutely riveting look at the the history of Berlin, and really, the history of the German people. Her writing is wonderful, intent on illluminating the spirit of the city. Not since I read Barbara Tuchman's ""The Guns of August"" have I so enjoyed a history."
4,tour de force,It's not often that a historical book dealing with the historical sweep of a major city retains the reader's interest from first to last page and at the same time makes riveting reading - well all credit to Alexandra Richie who manages both with considerable aplomb. Never the easiest of subjects she makes the city bristle and come alive on every page and in the end you feel as though you know everything that has happened to this fascinating city.
5,So adorable!!!,"This is my first review on Amazon.com. But after getting this stuff toy, I just had to tell everyone how soft, adorable, and snuggable the bear is. It's really too cute that I feel like I want to just buy another one. The quality of the cloth used is sooooo soft and feels real nice. It does shed a bit on your clothes if you hug it too long, but I think its cuteness is all that matters."
2,A strange interpretation,"Not at all one of best, as it should have been. Too divergent from the book and full of over-emoting, so rare in British works."
2,Poirot as avenging angel,"O gosh, o dear . . . the most successful Poirot of all films, David Suchet, presents here a bigoted, lecturing, 'my way or the highway,' almost vengeful 'soldier of the Law-is-always-Right' sluth. Yuck. Mr. Suchet deserves better from both director and writers. What's the point of all that religion? Suddenly he's fingering rosary and praying. Is this the Poirot we know and love? And why is the Ob/gyn doc following him around, offering silly explanations of the crime?God is the Law, perhaps. What a waste of the brilliant Eileen Atkins.Love the train, the coach appointments, the snow banks, period costumes."
2,Poirot portrayed as a crazy person,"I prefer Sidney Lumet's movie version and I recommend the travel program ""David Suchet on the Orient Express"" instead. I thought this production was terrible. Neither the costumes nor the train looked attractive and the acting was unspectacular."
2,what a waste,"I can not add much to what other reviewer have stated about how much I was let down by this re-telling of this great whodonit. In fact, other than making Ratchett more the very poster child of pure evil than was done 35 years ago, this version is a total bomb. I want to point out that this is not the fault of the actor's, as they can only work with what they are given, and in this case the script the actor's are given to work with is in this version of the story is total rat do-do. I know the big brains want everything nowadays to be more ""edgy"", but they crossed the line here and wrecked what could have been a great story, what a waste"
4,Simply great!!,It can go from being a simple to use P&S to a feature loaded manual camera. Great picture quality and very easy to use with your computer/ TV. The only negatives are the lens cap and card size.Go on...buy it...
4,Nice camera - a little expensive,"This is a nice camera. It is just the right size - very small, but not too small to be hard to handle. The pictures we have taken with look great, both on printed photos (local printer and through online service) and on screen. Given that the camera was not cheap, I was a little dissapointed that I then had to dish out more money on the following: -memory card - it only comes with 8 MB, you probably want at least 32 MB -rechargable batteries and a charger -better editing software than comes with camera -cable for serial port (only an issue if you don't have USB, but you really need USB or the pictures take forever to download)."
5,satisfaction,"i am totally satisfied with olympus c-3000, i was told i would recieve the camera in the alotted time and was impressed when it came a few days early, my only problem with the package was it was missing a memory card, but two out of three ain't bad!:)"
4,Nice deal!,"The positive reviews are right on, IMO. This camera takes great pics, allows you to record short videos with sound and so on. My only advice is to invest in rechargeable batteries, or stock up on the AA, because this thing is a battery hog! Great deal, though."
4,Excellent Camera-easy to use,"Camera is easy to use and light weight. The screen is not to small, yet not so large to suck up your batteries if you use it as the view finder. Lots of modes to change your resolutions and quite easy to do. Nice to be able to set your defaults.The only think that I wish this camera had is a better zoom. Great for taking picures 15 ft. or closer, but if you want to take shots that are far away, it is not that good."
2,Boring Dance of Ghost,"It was a plot that's been done a million times before, archaeologists digging on sacred ground and the mummy of a native American comes and kills a bunch of people.Lame, inept slasher film adds nothing special to this sub genre of horror films. Boring throughout, it takes a long time for the film to get started, and even at the climax it suffers from a ""been there, done that"" feel and it's not remotely scary. Definitely feels like it was made by amateurs. Not good words to hear if you want to watch a film but then those are the words that best fit this film. This movie was an attempt at a slasher-style horror thriller but it's no better than any and actually less fun than many of those. This film drags and drags and then there's that horrible disco dance music. Slow and plodding describes it perfectly."
4,Good deal for the price,"I am starting Japanese Jujutsu, and made the mistake of having my first uniform tailored before washing and drying it. Now 7 months later, that first uniform looks like I'm trying to fit into my sons clothes. I purchased this Shock Wave uniform because I wanted something that fit, was ok for a beginner, and didn't cost too much.I made sure to wash it a couple times, and the shrinkage seems to make things fit very nicely. I'm only 5'8, but 200lbs with a 34"" waist (I tend towards a muscular build), and it's tough to find things that fit right. I probably won't get this tailored, as it seems to fit well. The elastic waistband in the pants are a nice touch, and it still has a drawstring you can tie.For the money paid, I'm happy. Piranha also included care instructions which was a simple but nice touch. They seem to have a nice personal service."
4,A little small,"I ordered this gi, looks good, works fine, my only complaint is that I ordered based on the height guide provided but after washing a few times the top is now just a little short in the sleeves. I would order a size bigger next time."
4,Good gi,"It's a great gi and it looks as described, the only thing that made me rate it 4 stars is the fact that the material is thicker so during the warm seasons you might sweat and ""suffer""..."
5,Damn Good Rock and Roll,"It is a little rough (commercial release was apparently never planned), but it is very, very good. Jo Jo may have been crazy but the song is a standout, as are In a Heartbeat of Time and King of Hearts.I have reservations about Heartbreak Hill, but only with the lyrics, not the singing or the sound.Put it in the car, turn the volume up, and the opening riff of I'm Serious will suck you right in. I guarantee you will take the long way home so you can hear it all the way through!"
5,All Hummel masses now recorded,"When firstly seeing a list of Hummel's outputs quite a few years ago I noticed his 5 grand symphonic masses listed and wondered if we would ever hear them. This is the last to be recorded and I havent been disappointed. What a wonderful sacred work this is jsut like the others! This mass is strongly influenced by Mozart's Piano Concerto in D minor (the same key). But the real suprise on this dsic is the exquisite setting to the once famous Latin Catholic Prayer, Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy. Like Schubert's setting of Ave Maria this is every bit as magnificant. Other composers ( most notabely Haydn wrote a setting to Save Regina) but this Hummel setting is oustanding by any measure."
4,Brilliant Synthesis,"A wonderful synthesis, learned but not wordy, of the kind that only a very senior historian could write. Effectively conveys his views as to many complicated problems of early Greece, while giving due regard to the positions of others."
2,"Informative, yet drab for the outsider","This book was used in part, for a class on the in Classics on the Age of Homer. This book describes early Greek life and culture in depth, yet at the same time seemed to be way over my head. The text is very longwinded and confusing for someone who has not met the material before, and would not recommend it as a book to read in your pasttime. Rather, the book is very thorough, and would make for great refernce material, giving an in depth perspective to early Greek culture."
4,Cheaper than at Macys,This gift wet was cheaper than at a local department store and no parking fees. Hooray!
2,They could have sent the right product !,"What I ordered shouls have included the shower gel. It didn't, the shower gel was replaced with a very small bottle of Obsession Night.Obsession By Calvin Klein For Women. Set-eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces & Body Lotion 3.3 Ounces & Shower Gel 3.3 Ounces"
5,Very Satisfied.,Received this book on time and in the condition promised. Very pleased. The book is a Christmas gift so I have not read it yet. This is the sequel to Random Passage so I am excited to read. We visited the site where the movie was made and Newfoundland is still very isolated and beautiful. Author is true to what life was like during the cod fishing era in Newfoundland.
5,NIGHT SCENES IN THE BIBLE,"I HAVE OWNED THREE COPIES OF THIS MASTERPIECE BY DANIEL MARCH. WITHOUT A DOUBT, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ, EXCEPT FOR THE BIBLE. DANIEL MARCH HAD TO HAVE HAD A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE "" HOLY SPIRIT."" THIS GIFTED WRITER HAS A WAY OF TRANSPORTING YOU INTO EACH SCENE. I FEEL I HAVE REALLY VISITED THE HOLY LAND AND WALKED WITH EACH PERSON IN ""THE NIGHT SCENES.""I STILL OWN ONE COPY AND WISH I COULD FIND FIVE MORE FOR MY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN."
2,Not a good product,"This toy may be cute, but it stops functioning after about a day. This is far too expensive for what you get."
5,Not for the lightweights,"Typically you'll find the first chapter of the book to merely introduce a character or idea, but in True Discipleship, Bill McDonald challenges you.This book was not written for those who only desire to be Christian in name only or who merely attend church because they think it's good for them. True Discipleship goes through Biblical commands of Christ on how each one of us ought to live. These are not just ideas, but principles and commands from Christ himself!!Somehow we've chosen to ignore many of these things here in America, but Christ commands transcend all culture.A great book for those who want to be challenged and transformed for Christ."
2,Great Title - Consuming Subject - Average Writing,"Mr McDonald describes his conception of discipleship OK, but he doesn't do much in the way of exegesis of the biblical texts. I'd maybe knock it up half a star if I could. Doesn't compare well with Whitney, Foster, or Willard though. At least it is short."
2,It is short.,That's probably one of the books strong points. There are better treatments as another review says. Not a lot of substance.
4,Overlooked but well worthwhile,"This is an old-school political thriller filmed in Russia, starring actress Tara Reid (in one of her best roles). An intricate plot, outstanding location scenery and some fine performances put this one over very well. ""Silent Partner"" isn't a typical popcorn action flick, but it will satisfy those looking for intelligent intrigue.A solid 3 1/2 star film, recommended."
1,too bad its not a remake,Too bad this isn't a remake of the '70's Elliott Gould thriller. Tara's head sawed off into a fish-bowl might be worth seeing.
2,OKAY,"I was so anxious to get this and when I finally did, my daughter was just not that interested with it. She barely plays with it. I was hoping that with this she would spend more time on her tummy because she normally hates that. Maybe that's why she didn't care much for this."
3,Not Interested....,"I love the Baby Einstein line, and have many other items, so I purchased this one to help my son increase his tummy time. I found that the toys hang either to low or to high, everything is right in his face. I do love the musical player included, and the lights and tunes it plays but that is about the only thing that keeps my sons attention, if he tries to role he is hitting something. The hanging toys included are pretty lame, and hard for him to grab. I also think it is overpriced. Cute idea, but needs a little work."
2,not worth the money,"I recently purchased this for my 3 month old nephew who loves finding nemo...i figured this has an ocean scene and bright colors ...how can i go wrong..i'll admit the price was a little steep...$70...but i figured if it keeps him occupied and happy why not...i'll have to admit , i was happy with it and he liked it...the dangling toys are great and can clip on to a carrier seat or carriage...however...warning to all moms...the mirror that comes with this product will interest your child, but is too heavy for the velcro it comes with...found that out the hard way when it fell and hit him square in his head. for what i paid, that should have been attached to the product itself...it could have spared him a lot of pain and me the agony of feeling bad all day because the toy i bought him ended up hurting him...moms its not worth it."
2,My baby has NO interest in it!,My daughter is now 3 1/2 months old. I have put her under this gym for 2 months and she still has NO interest. The mirror isn't positioned where she can see herself and the toys are boring to look at compared to her tiny love mobile she has in her crib.I know others rate it high but keep the packaging until after you know if your little one likes it! =)
1,The water leaked....,"I thought this would be great, it looked a lot better than the gym I had for my now two year old. My 12 week old liked it until one day I couldn't figure out why it was going off all by itself. When I went to look at it closer, I noticed the water was leaking! Needless, to say I will be taking it back."
2,Not enough bang for your buck,"The other baby einstein gym is much more functional and cheaper too. The thing I don't like about this one is that the mesh pieces that hang from the top are too low for a tummy baby to play. My son's head is constantly rubbing on it. He got this as a Christmas present at which time he was 4 months old and he already seems bored with it. My friend has the other einstein play mat (the really colorful one) and her 6 month old still uses it daily. She can also sit up and play with it. The water one is too low down (the cross part that the toys hang on). It is also too expensive, you can get something more entertaining for a lot less money. Good luck. I haven't had a problem with any of the other baby einstein products we have. In fact my son loves the movies and the little stationary play saucer keeps him busy for a long time. I hope this helped. Bottom line, too much money not enough product."
1,Overpriced and Leaks,"I bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats. I like the scalloped edges, the pillow and the colorful pictures, but I am disappointed in the playmat overall. The pat mat leaks so bad that I can't use it. The playmat is cute, but it isn't functional, not to mention, WAY OVERPRICED. The arches have netting which I think freaks my son out. He has never liked this playmat. I have a square one that he seems to enjoy more."
2,Not Impressed,We received this as a shower gift and have tried over the last 4 months to get our son to use it. The mirror is the only part he seems interested in and it only entertains him for a few minutes. Colors are way to dull. Wish we would have done a little more research before registering for this.
4,Great activity gym!,"Santa brought this for our 2 1/2 month old and she has loved it since we took it out of the bag. In the beginning she loved just staring in the mirror and seeing the lights. Now that she's 5 1/2 months old she loves batting at/tugging on the toys, talking to the baby in the mirror, and babbling along with the music. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun gym for their little one."
1,Horrible product,"These sprays smell horribly, didn't work at all, and to top it off: when they were shipped to me, the bottles themselves were dirty and covered with a foul-smelling substance. Not only will I not buy this brand again, but I also wouldn't buy from a seller that sends products with foul sticky gunk all over it. I would give zero stars if I could."
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to love this video, but I don't. I am new to astanga and really wanted to learn from this video. I am very frustrated that I can't get to the finishing sequences in any way on the practice video (or the instructional video either, for that matter), aside from fast forwarding to the very end (which would take a very long time.) I can't find any way to add the finishing sequences to my practice without memorizing them and ""doing them on your own"", as suggested within the video. Without being able to skip to the finishing sequences on the instructional video, I can't easily memorize them.In my opinion, the lack of any menu at all on the practice video makes it unusable. I have owned this for a few years. I keep trying again, and keep giving up. I will finally buy a video with a more useful menu."
5,Collector's Guide,"I have considered purchasing an MG Midget for some time. This book reviews the specifics for each year the car was produced. Black and white photos are'nt much to look at, but give an excellent reference for model differences from year to year. Excellent book!"
4,"I'm not the best one to ask, but","I ordered this decal because my son and I are HUGE hockey fans, looked in retail stores and could not find it here in California. 3-4 days after placing my order, it was here! Honestly, I have yet to apply to my car because I have wondered if it would last or get stolen! Sad but true, and other than that aspect I love it and I am completely happy with my purchase!"
2,Mixed Feelings,"Great Concept - keyboard drawer & monitor pedestal all in one; saves space on your desk; tucks away keyboard when not in use & elevates monitor a little to bring it to your eye-level.Unfortunately, not very many choices/brands of this product out there.While the Kensington K60006HD is easy to assemble, it is a little pricey for its poor quality and design - the component materials are a little flimsy; the pedestal only sits on the drawer-frame (it is not screwed on) so if you ever have to move it, be very careful - if you lift it by the pedestal, the drawer will fall off!; also, the drawer sticks way out at the back, which tends to defeat the purpose of saving space somewhat."
2,Sorry Lloyd - not this one,"Over the past couple of years I have bought 3 of Lloyd's works - Songs in a Foreign Language, The Negatives, and Antidepressant.Lloyd's clever song writing and unique vocal styling worked very successfully with the backing of the brilliant Commotions, resulting in all those hits of the 80s and beyond. I feel he took a chance with his solo works - exposing his basically weak and fragile voice for scrutiny.This shows on SIAFL where sparse accompaniment and too many poor songs don't carry the day. My Other Life was the only one that I thought worthy of the man's talent.The problem is that every song is of a very similar tempo - you long for some injection of beat and rhythm. In the end his vocal mannerisms grate, and it all becomes rather irritating. For someone new to Lloyd's music this album would make a very poor introduction.For solo Lloyd fans I recommend the gorgeous Antidepressant - it all works brilliantly on this, where SIAFL fails."
5,Lloyd is still amazing..,"This is a long time coming, as I first listened to this album in a bus while travelling to Montreal in spring 2004. Dark record in a dark bus on a dark evening, and coincidentally, during the beginning of a lapse into a two year period of depression. And because of all these factors aligning, MIAFL has fused itself into my soul like a friend who was there when I needed them. ""My Other Life"", ""No More Love Songs"" and ""Shelf Life"" are like medicine."
2,Poor Vanilla,"As individual songs, many of the selections are fairly good. Mr. Cole continues to write thoughtful, unguarded lyrics that can become self absorbed. The arrangements and melodies are sparse and subdued throughout so it is hard to maintain interest after several cuts. I would suggest people try to borrow the CD first to determine if it is to their liking before making the purchase. His work with the Primatives exhibits a much better balance."
5,Great singing!,What an amazing voice. Love her Broadway style and great diction! Couple this with great arrangements and Stephen Sondheim at the piano and you will play this CD again and again.
3,Rest In Peace Johnny Ramone,"At the time this album came out, it was a big disappointment to most Ramones fans. The group had not had much commercial success up to this point, so they brought in producers Ritchie Cordell & Glen Kolotkin, who had recently struck gold producing Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock and Roll"". The producers gave the group more of a pop sheen, smoothing out their rough edges. Despite this attempt to be more commercial, the album didn't sell any better than any of their other albums. There was also personal turmoil behind the scenes, as drummer Marky was fired from the group due to his drinking problem. So, how is the final product? Not so good, in my opinion. The album features a mere two songs that I would consider to be Ramones ""classics"" (""Psycho Therapy"" and ""Outsider""). The rest of the original material is pretty mediocre. Even the cover songs are not as good as usual. This album will only be of interest to hardcore Ramones fans (which I consider myself to be)."
3,Two killer songs,"This is worth buying if only for 'Psycho Therapy' and 'Time Has Come Today'. The rest is mostly average Ramones -- a few clunkers, and a few humorous gems ('Time Bomb', 'Everytime I Eat Vegetables')."
5,Best mid-period Ramones.,This is much better than 'Too Tough' or 'Halfway 2 Sanity'. It might be the last really great album that they made.
5,Their Last GREAT Album,"I have to agree with the previous reviewers who said this was their last great album top to bottom. And it is great!!! Outsider, My-My Kind of a Girl, Little Bit O' Soul, awesome!!!I get all misty talking about this album...it was the only album that really mattered to me and my friends my senior year in high school. Just listening to this album takes me back to 1984."
3,Some diamonds are in the rough...,"This album, like most Ramones albums, contains some real treasures.Little Bit O' Soul is a great cover.I Need Your Love may be the perfect punk pop song ever written. I love it!You're probably better off buying those singles than the whole album."
4,Psycho Therapy!,"This was my 2nd favorite at one time,but now I don't seem to enjoy it as much. Hell its still 4 stars because of ""Psycho Therapy"". Probably too many covers and lack of bubblegum tunes don't make this as good anymore. Although it does include ""My My Kind Of A Girl"",sadly one of the last true bubblegum songs ever done by the Ramones!"
3,ehh....average,"i never really got into this album...i does have great moments, like 'outsider,' 'in the park,' 'everytime i eat...,' 'psycho therapy' and the cover of 'a little bit of soul.' the production on this one is obnoxious in my opinion, mainly because of the really big drum sound and the use of tambourines everywhere. 'my-my kind of girl' is almost unlistenable...there's just something about that song that disgusts me. i wouldn't recommend this as your first ramones album by a long shot."
4,Welcome To The Jungle,"Subterranean Jungle is a step towards the early punk rock that the Ramones mastered. On this album the Ramones sounded more main stream. With covers of ""Little Bit O soul"" which is one of their best covers, and ""I Need Your Love"" and ""Time Has Come Today"" are especially too many covers for one album. The original material like ""Psycho Therapy"" and ""Somebody Like Me"" are excellent Ramones songs. Subterranean Jungle is a good attempt for the Ramones, but borders on self parody."
4,Building the Perfect Pop-Punk Beast!,"The great thing about re-issues with previously unreleased bonus tracks is that you get a chance to play Monday morning producer -- remaking the album with cuts left on the studio floor. And fact is, SUBTERRANEAN JUNGLE could've been an even stronger album when it was initially released had the Ramones made some better picks from the songs at their disposal. Like UNHAPPY GIRL -- a buoyant and blistering track that should've bumped the wishy-washy SOMEBODY LIKE ME off the original version of JUNGLE. Meanwhile, the boys' cover of INDIAN GIVER is a smokin' slab of bubblepunk -- far superior to the lame I NEED YOUR LOVE on the original. Finally, the newly released BUMMIN' ALONG is a classic hot-wired Dee Dee moment and would've made a much stronger original album track than HIGHEST TRAILS ABOVE. There, these changes would've made JUNGLE a bona fide classic instead of a near miss. But no need to lament, buy the re-issue and enjoy all the terrif tunes!"
4,Blitzkriegin' Bonus Tracks!,"""Sub Jungle"" was one of the Ramones' great mid-period attempts to save rock'n'roll via a unique brand of bazooka-fired bubblegum punk-pop. And they pumped out out some classics on this platter, including ""Time Bomb,"" ""Psycho Therapy"" and the brilliant ""Everytime I Eat Vegetables It Makes Me Think Of You."" But you know all that. The big news here is that the bonus tracks are a blast. ""New Girl"" ranks as one of Joey's best attempts to update the Ronettes. Johnny's raucous riffs make former cast-offs ""Bummin' Along"" and ""Unhappy Girl"" more worthy than some of the tracks that made the album's first cut. And finally, the sparkling acoustic version of ""My-My Kind of a Girl"" makes you wonder all over again why the pop world never rewarded these guys with the smash hit they richly deserved. Buy it."
3,I wish I heard what the other commentors heard...,"I am a great admirer of Previn; in fact, I think he is one of the finest conductors of the second half of the 20th century, and I think he is especially good with works by Prokofiev, but not this time. His recording of the 5th is lugubrious, lumbering like a great tank rolling across the landscape. There is nothing that makes me setup and take notice. There are so many others that displace this one, but I think the recent recording by Noseda and the BBC PhilharmonicSymphony No.5 /War and Peaceis especially fine, so much more engaging. As for the First Symphony, this work almost plays itself and the Los Angeles players aquit themselves admirably."
3,virtuosity is not enough,"I'm disappointed with this effort by the prodigiously talented Mr Carter. There's no question about his technical ability but in music that's not enough. I get the impression that some A&R person thought a CD on Django might be a go, and Mr Carter went along with it. Ms Regina Carter on the other hand comes across as much more musically interesting and shines on a couple of tracks. I'd only heard Mr Braxton play the Bass Saxophone prior to this effort but Mr Carter is quite at home on that huge instrument. This music places few demands on the listener."
1,How Carter Is Able To Pay His Rent Is Beyond Me,"James Carter, whom I've already wrote 2 reviews on, bombs another release with ""Chasin' The Gypsy."" What is up with this guy? Can't he put out a decent album that swings and doesn't sound like a trainwreck? His approach to saxophone playing is amateurish. He has no lyricism, melodic invention, and his saxophone tone is forceful and downright annoying. No kind of warmth to be found. Why record companies continue to back no talents like James Carter is beyond me. Thank goodness for the '40s, '50s, and early '60s when jazz was an important medium to express oneself in. Now, all we have are guys like Carter who don't seem to understand anything about being melodic."
2,Worst CD in my collection,"""Quick Change World"" isn't bad at first, the first half of the album really is pretty good with the exception of the first song (total garbage). Then the ""left side"" of the album comes on, as it is listed on the CD case, and it's total garbage. The whole second half of the cd doesn't have one good song, ""What's on TV"" is a good example of how bad they are.If you are a big cars/ocasek fan, you should check this out for the first part of it but you'll soon find this cd in the bottom of your cd collection if you bother with the other half."
4,Quick change world,"Ric's fourth studio album, this is a good album ric made. You could hear the cars sound in sole tracks and the rest is pretty good, not a bad album, I love Ric's solo work."
5,"Most comprehensive and well organized, will save you time and money","I find this book extremely useful. It offers precious practical advice for solving problems, such as car trouble, home repairs, dealing with traffic police, medical emergencies and many others. I bought ""Resolving Problems and Emergencies"" by Natasha Cooper back when I was an ESL student and have been using it since. It is a collection of common problems that you encounter in daily life and scripts for solving them. The book comes with 4 audio CDs, which is an additional benefit for a non-native speaker of English. It helped me save money in billing disputes and banking problems I deal with at work (I am working at a Finance Department). This is by far the best, most comprehensive and well organized book available on the subject, and I highly recommend it to all those who want to confidently resolve problems or avoid them altogether."
2,A matter of preference,"These are pieces that require a very introspective interpretation, particularly the Ravel & the Fouré. To me, these performances are too precise & stiff. Perhaps renditions for two hands rather than four allow more scope for interpretation. For instance, the subtle dissonances in the Dolly Berceuse, to my ears, need a little more emphasis. That said, it's all a matter of taste."
3,A good idea book,"I enjoy reading this cookbook more to gather ideas than to find recipes I want to cook. Alice Waters describes how she and her team at Chez Panisse created many of their memorable meals, what inspired them, the problem that arose, and how they worked around those problems. What she doesn't write about as much is the actual process of preparing the food--the recipes. Of course, for some of these menus, it would be virtually impossible to create in a home kitchen, or to have access to the ingredients (a pig feed a diet heavy with garlic comes to mind). Good ideas for the knowledgable cook."
4,Great for the price,"I am sure a higher end model would be nicer, but for the price I don't think you can beat this. I love it! It went together very easily, and with the poster and dvd's I got started right away and use it almost every day. I have absolutely no complaints and would highly recommend this one to anyone wanting to get started with a reformer. AND, after only a week I started to feel the difference in my rapidly aging body! After three weeks I definitely started looking more toned! I don't know why everyone does not have one of these!"
5,A Financial Advisor's Review,"Gave this to a client who wanted to be more knowledgeable about basic investing. She spent the weekend working through the book, and called to say it's the best book she's ever read. She said she placed it beside her Bible as her second most important book for her family!"
5,Really helpful & suprising,"I read this on a flight overseas. It helped me to understand what I've been doing wrong over the past few years. As a doctor I have very little time to commit to investing however this was without a doubt one of the most useful and practical books I've ever read on investing. I only wish I'd gotten it sooner, it would have stopped me from making a lot of mistakes! Easy to apply and gave me some real peace of mind."
5,This Was Really Great,"This book was easy to follow. Fun and insightful. Unlike most investment books its not just a dictionary of investment terms it actually taught me how it all works. I learnt so much about investing, and myself. It was flat out great. I have been investing for some time but this showed me what I was doing wrong. I'm sending it to my kids in college so they get an early start."
1,Cowboy Action Pistol Shooting,"This book is in reality a thin paperback, only 68 pages. The first half of the book is stories about gunfights in the late 1800s. The author finally gets to Cowboy action in the second half but poorly covers the subject. No recommendation on the caliber to use, not even a comparision. As far as the type of pistol to buy he makes no commitment. He claims they are all good. I found the pamphlet to be of little use and poorly thought out."
1,....,".... If you want to learn about the care, feeding, and manipulation of the single action revolver, buy Sixguns by Elmer Keith. If you want to learn about the handguns and holsters used in Cowboy Action Shooting Mr. Stephens provides a brief list of manufacturers, but nothing in the way of details or descriptions about their products. If you already know how to shoot any type of handgun, you already know more than you could possibly learn from this book. If you don't know anything about handling firearms, then this book is not the place to start. The book includes very rudimentary descriptions of shooting stances, but nothing specifically related or unique about Cowboy Shooting. You can learn more about the proper way to handle a revolver by watching John Wayne in The Shootist than you will learn from this book. If you are interested in Cowboy Shooting or revolvers in general, read Elmer Keith's book Sixguns, and then request the rule book from the Single Action Shooting Society. I wish I had."
5,"Haunting, singable, complex, moving.","Unlike anything else he's done -which a career-long fan hopes/fears. And, once again, a brilliant gift - in concept and execution. Risky and deeply rewarding. As with all True Art, not only bears but improves with repeated listening/contemplation."
5,"I sob, I laugh, I hear the songs in my head","I've had this CD for a few years and have tried to introduce a number of friends to it; but there's a problem: this CD doesn't work, CAN'T work as background music. With all those ingenious twists of words, music, and metre (like ""pass the vinegar, I'm beginning to think"" jammed into 5 beats or so.) it is a totally immersive, emotionally demanding artistic tour-de-force that just won't let you ignore it... and may just leave you crying."
4,Get It!,"Being a mild fan of Elvis Costello, and thinking that string quartets are the greatest invention in music in the last 500 years, I was curious to give this album a listen.EC and the Brodskys use the string quartet medium to travel through all the wide ranges of textures and emotions that are possible with those instruments. The cynic in me imagines the artists flipping through a catalogue ""1001 Sounds to Make With a Violin/Cello Combination"", and wondering what sort of letter it sounds like.Actually, I think the ""letter"" theme is stretched a bit in places, but even then the results are masterful works in which Elvis Costello shines in a fresh medium for him.EC has traded in his magic markers for a set of watercolors, and as we've all known for twenty years, he really knows how to paint a picture.After this album, I'm now a wild fan!"
3,Interesting attempt,"This is a noble and bold attempt on Costello's part. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. His voice and those sharp strings add up to a fairly grating experience when taken as a whole. ""Taking My Life in Your Hands"" is a good song in any book, though."
1,skip it!,"Sorry, this is one to avoid. I give him some credit for trying something different, but there are really no songs that stand up with his best.I have all of his cd's, and this is the one I like least."
4,A Good Intro To Ponty,"But I tend to think that the typical customer for this kind of retrospective is someone who listened to Ponty in the past and is looking to rebuild a collection. That being the case, I would suggest that instead of settling for this CD sampler, you buy the first five albums: ""Upon The Wings Of Music,"" ""Aurora,"" ""Imaginary Voyage,"" ""Enigmatic Ocean,"" and ""Cosmic Messenger."" Having followed Ponty over the years, I find that that is still the best stuff. If you're not sure about spending so much, go ahead and get this. It's a pretty good deal. But I bet you'll wind up doing what I do, which is mostly just to listen to the first half of the CD."
5,It s just incredible!,"Ponty has been always great of greatest since the very beginning and the biggest proof of all, is this cd not to mention all the rest, but the hits, this is the best of the best. In my personal opinion this cd show go straight to my Ponty coleccion, It's just something I cannot express with words, in my name and of all of Jean Luc Ponty's fan definetly deserves a 5 stars rate and maybe much more..."
3,seems ok,I just used this on a whim to save a few bucks in an urgent situation.Happy to get it out and go back to Mobil-1 filter after another 500 milesbut seems ok. Oil feels a bit more gritty after 1K miles than I haveexperienced with Mobil 1. Wont buy again but can't recommend againstfor value.
5,Great Cd,Clash is the first cd put out by Scarlet Road. I love the guitar work its excellent. This band is Definately going somewhere! Great Job Guys! Such an Inspiration to us all. |_ _|Forever in our memories.
5,This CD is absolutly great!,"I am a great fan of Jon and Richard Jackson but I wasn't sure if I would like their music, but when I heard this cd I instantly fell in love with it. The music is uplifting and their talents are great. I know these are some of the most talented(and down to earth) guys out in Hollywood!"
4,Very GOOD!!!,"I have had this CD for about 6 months now and it is truly enjoyable! I've listened to the CD so many times, I know the words inside out. some of of the words are vague in some songs. But if you get this CD make sure you listen for the ""secret track"" at the end. :)"
5,Church History from William's View,"This book has been out of print for some time like so many of William's writings. Several years ago I ordered a used copy for an extravagant amount of money, so it is nice to see it for a decent price. This book is a summary of church history as seen from William's characteristic vision of the distinction and the interrelationship between The Way of Negation and the Way of Affirmation. Many of the figures and movements that Williams covers are traditional but they are illuminated in exciting new ways by his thought. The chapter on the Reformation alone is worth the price of the whole book. Others are non-traditional, for example, his very brief positive and cryptic mention of a group called the subinductae in the early church. If you have a taste for Williams at all (which many do not) you won't be disappointed."
5,spiritual history,"Descent of the Dove is a spiritual history of the church - it covers an immense amount of historical ground in a short space, but does so with an overarching sense of the spiritual significance of outer events that is profound."
1,well at least its leather,"product is labeled an ax cover its realy a hatch cover not an ax cover wont fit even half way on waste of time and money,false advertisement."
3,Wich to choose!?,Ever felt like in a lot of pressure buying a book that you haven't seen inside at least the first pages.I mean.......think about it.You are gonna buy a 20$ book and when you open it and see the first pages....IT STINKS!Or you keep thinking it's a worthless book and then it's the best book in the world!My opinion?I would left the book behind and just walk away.I mean there are a lot of fish in the sea and a lot of corals too.One day you will choose the best book ever and almost prizeless...............................
2,One Hit Wonder,"Other than the hit, I Watched It On My Radio, I didn't care for anything else on the CD. I found most of it just the usual drivel about ""Baby I love you forever"" or ""Baby, sorry I done you wrong."" However, I really like the one hit, so it was a worthwhile purchase for me."
2,Disappointed -- skip it,"No doubt about it - Isabelle Huppert gives a great performance, but the plot leaves a lot to be desired. The movie is intended to portray the fragile and doomed relationship between Melanie Laurent's character with her mother, played beautifully by Isabelle Huppert. However, the movie lacks credibility and Melanie Laurent's character seems half-asleep throughout the majority of the film. I admire both actresse's work, in particular Ms. Huppert, but I have to say this movie left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, unless you enjoy long, drawn-out and very predictable endings. Watch The Pianist with Ms. Huppert instead, or Je vas bien, ne t'en fais pas, with Melanie Laurent, who gives an incredibly moving performance."
1,Where is the Love?,"This film was torturous for me and I doubted that I even wanted to finish it. It's hard to watch a self-absorbed, mentally ill woman contort herself in her endless self-castigation. Huppert plays the part well and makes you really hate the character she portrays. ""Extremely unloveable"" is how I would describe her. It is the extreme of the famous hard-edged, je m'en fou of some of the other characters she portrays (La Vie Promise, The Piano, Violette).I have been a big fan of Isabelle Huppert and have seen almost every film she's been in at least twice. This film shows her range and ability to make herself look ugly and truly insane. It is a great study in the hideous twists the human mind can get itself into.Where is the love? The love is deeply hidden within her and can't get out because of how her mind operates and her extreme selfishness. This film is like spending a couple of hours with a miserable, depressed person who refuses to snap out of it."
3,Monotonous fiddling around,"I like Mark OConnor and I like fiddles but, as with that irish jig dancing, a little bit goes a long way for me. He has a few good cuts on this album but I rarely leave it on to play all the way through. It gets boring for me. Diddle dee dee, diddle dee dee, diddle diddle diddle and on and on and on ...."
5,very good,What better selection to listen to on st pattys day. This is a blend of ole time fiddling and some very progressive licks. By fa r my fav cut is Nomad in which Mark does incredible duets with Hindu themes. Also check out Liberty CD concerning songs of rev war. c. 1996
5,A Nifty Little Light,"I bought my light a year ago, and use it regularly going to and from the bus stop. It has a nice beam for such a small flashlight. I am very happy with it, and have given them as gifts (in fact I am ordering 3 more for gifts this year)."
4,Must read for serious Catholics,"For those of us raised in the post Vatican II era, this is a very eye opening and sobering view of what has transpired in the Catholic Church."
4,"Great product, good value","This stuff works great...my lil guy refuses to be litter trained so I tend to go through alot of this.It has a pleasant, fresh scent, it gets the stain out straight away and you only need a little bit.I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because my ferret continues to go in the same places. It does nothing to deter the use of the cleaned areas"
3,"mostly the same as ""the very best of""","This is actually a European release of ""the best of"" from 2000. the artwork is exactly the same as the U.S. one cd and Canadian two cd versions. The only thing Amazon.com doesn't tell you is that there is a disc 2 with 4 new remixes of ""Riders..."" . They are: 1. Baez and Cornell tunnel club mix, 2. N.O.W. mix, 3. Ibizarre remix, 4. SpaceBats remix, #5 is a multi-media track with: interview,gallery, e-card, and more. My computer doesn't like enhanced cds so i dont know what else. 3 star review is only because of purists who won't like the remixes, although #4 is cool. Disc one of course is great, but redundant."
4,"Dr Sichel saved me, and her book can save others","I myself was diagnoised with severe PPD by Dr. Sichel in 1988, I am thankful everyday to have found such a wonderful Doctor, who could finally tell me that I would be better. It was the most horrific time in my life and no one seemed to understand what I was going through, until my husband came across Dr. Sichel and we went to see her. It was 14 years ago but to this day I am amazed at how intuned she was with the illness and the problems women suffered with, such as shame, fear, worthlessness. It is a great relief to know that you will come out of the black aybss, and things will return to normal. For anyone who has not read the book it is well worth it, helping to understand the problem and knowing you are not alone is the begining to your recovery. Between Dr. Sichel and Jean Driscoll they have a most compassionate way about them. When no one understood me, they did! Hats off to them and to their book."
2,A little tedious,"I thought the book was a bit tedious. The authors spent a good deal of time laying out concepts and brain chemistry and describing various psychiatric disorders. The portion on the wellness program, I felt was just skimmed over briefly. They also tend to spend a good deal of time addressing the need for medications and don't go into any detail about what might work for a person for whom medications have proven to be ineffective."
1,Not for the over 45 woman,"As a mental health practioner and former patient of one of this books authors,I would like to add a word of caution to all menopausal readers .One theory does not fit all This book and it's often sketchy theory does not adequately address the issues of menopause and periomenopause. If you are concerned with these issues and looking for answers do not waste money on this book(or these people).Get a good GYN and listen to what she/he has to say."
1,Limited,"Although the book was well written it is very limited in scope. As a minister I work with a number of women who struggle with many conditions including polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is not only a leading cause of infertility but which also causes serious hormonal fluctuations.(This book does not even mention polycystic ovarian syndrome.) The text of this work is primarily dedicated to postpartum issues and PMS symptoms and women who struggle with such issues would find this to be a good resource."
1,Must read!,"This book is especially a must read for women interested in understanding the physiology behind our emotions. The ""mysteries"" of our female bodies are clearly explained here, with compassion and understanding. Suddenly, I understand so much more about my physical and emotional well-being."
1,"Did not make me feel better, only worse","I'm not sure if this book is good or not. I found no hope in their plan of treating depression. The NURSE protocol is something I have been doing for 6 years, except for the drugs. Reading this book, though it may not have been their intent, has left me feeling like it's too late for me, that I will have to live with this depression and anxiety for the rest of my life. While I have never had any illusions about it, to have it put in those terms gives me more grief than relief. I did not find any hope or peace from this book. Too bad, because it feels like the idea does work for some women. I wish they had some more hope. That is not their fault, but the way they presented it in the book was deflating to me."
1,Depressing and Hopeless for Women!,"I am sure that these women were trying to accomplish something worthwhile in writing this book, but I found it to be horribe!Being a victim of trauma related issues, I sense that one of the authors truly attempted to relay her own problems in her life with her husband and children, yet would bounce back to the issue of leagalized drugs as the answer for all problems. Frankly, making me wonder what was going on in her life while writing this book.I am also wondering if she has her ""clients"" tested for any possible problems prior to placing them on medications that may not even apply to their problems.All I can say is that it made me very afraid for her ""clients""!I think that the term best suited for this book would be ""Physician heal thyself""....before writing a book!Anyone looking for a quick fix? It isn't out there. Find a good therapist, one that will listen, one that you can TRUST!Buyer beware..spend it elsewhere!"
1,Drug Agenda Here,"What a sad book! Read the book and you'll notice how shepreaches depression as the main theme of being a female.Heranswer wouldn't ya know is a psychiatrict drug,Prozaic.Bad idea!I've known many people who have been dupped into taking thisdrug,both men and women,the results were heightened bipolardisorder,paranoia and more depression.It's a sales pitchfor drugs.She wants women to be drug dependent,out of controll of theirlives,helpless.The book does not empower women,it is a depressing book,written to horrify women and get them obsessingabout their every thought and mood.The premise is,all women are more or less the same,she couldn'tbe further from the truthBe a weary consumer,both in advice and drugs."
3,yes you are sexy,"A trite little single of the one original track on the LOA remix album ""Expand Your Head"". At first I wasn't too impressed, most of the remixes sound the same with only slight variations. However, this is a catchy little song and the more you listen to it the more you want to dance to it. This is by no means anywhere close to what LOA really sounds like. If you like fluffy little techno songs or are a die hard LOA fan then check it out."
2,Belongs on the Austin Powers Soundtrack,"Is this the Lords of Acid of ""Lust"" and ""Voodoo?"" This reminds me of a recent Madonna song that is on the ""Austin Powers"" Soundtrack. Shame on the Lords!"
5,dizzy for the dolls,"so I bought Dizzy Up the Girl like every other person in the world, and I'll admit it, I fell in love. Hard. so hard that I bought 3 albums from amazon at the same time, blowing a LOT of money, and then panicking when I realized that I had NO IDEA if their old stuff would suck or rule.take a guess.this album is so...tight. probably the best line ever in any song is ""he said I look like a Hollywood girl"" from ""On The Lie""and if you can't think of any other reason to buy it, get it for the hilarious picture on the back of John with the long hair, hi-top sneakers, and cuffed pants. he's a babe even in all that! and can these guys sing or what!!!"
5,100% pure alternative rock,"If you're a fan of alternative rock (like me), you MUST buy this CD. the best Goo album out there so far. I bought it like 4 years ago and still listening at it, and every time still feels like the first time. Even if u don't like the Goos, buy it and you'll be amazed by what these guy did back in 1993."
4,quite impressive,"i bought this cd with a boy named goo, and i have to say, that this is definately one of the better cds i have bought. not quite as impressive as dizzy up the girl, but it has some great songs, fallin down and we are the normal being two of the best songs. if u really like the sound of the dolls, dont hesitate to buy this album."
4,If you like the Goo Goo Dolls you should own this album,"This album was the first time I'd ever heard the Goo Goo Dolls way back when. ""We are the normal"" was the track, it got me interested & I later picked up this album. The GGD's rock & have a mellow side. This album showcases songs sung by both Johnny & Robby (I think the best that Robby's sounded). Of course I love Johnny's voice the best but they are both great on this one. My faves are We are the normal, cuz your gone & especially Girl right next to me. If you like the Goo Goo Dolls or your a big fan like me you need to buy this album!"
4,Early Goo -- At Its Very Best!,"A great, rocking early Goo CD! You will definitely get your money's worth from this Goo piece! Contains 11 Goo-written, rocking tunes by John Rzeznick and/or Robby Takac the ""glue"" behind the Goos. This album also features the Goo's first drummer, George Tutuska. Three other great tunes are included for your listening pleasure -- ""We Are The Normal,"" a Paul Westerburg composition, as well as ""Disconnected"" and ""Slave Girl;"" two tunes that will rock your socks off!"
3,Plenty of energy just like you would expect,"Unlike most people i heard this album when it was originally released in the early 80's, but i didn't purchase it until lately. It's a good solid release, with some standout songs but it's not on the level of their most recent releases. Prepare yourself for simple repetitive forced lyrics. The Dolls have progressed a ways in their lyrics so don't jump for this release until you have collected their newer material."
4,A PLEA FOR HELP!,"Some-one please tell me which album the song 'Iris' is on. A colleague at work wants to buy that CD for his lady, but I can't find it on any of the albums reveiwed here. Muchas gracios. BIG al."
3,A dissappointment,"I like the Goo Goo Dolls, but this cd was juts not up to the standards of the other ones. I was dissappointed with this purchase after listening to Dizzy up the Girl. The songs are repetitive and unimaginative. The lyrics are not up to their usual standards. The guitar is nice, but it's not enouhg to put a positive spin on the cd."
2,Font to small,Purchased this for my son to read with me but the font on some pages were so small we could not read it. We tried changing font size and it would not allow us to do it!? Will be requesting money back.
1,Kindle formating is AWEFUL!!!!,"Great little book, but several pages were not formatted correctly and were too small to read. Really disappointing. Going to ask for money bac on this one!!"
4,A great starting point,"For the purist needing to cite sources, this is a wonderful place to get started in order to locate the original document. However, it is not a source in and of itself that can be cited. Citing of evidence in the book is minimal, but useable. The ancestral family trees don't include dates, but by carefully following the text, one can deduce the information. The sorting of material by century makes lookups a bit tedious, as one must search 17th century, then 18th century, and then several addendum to the original 1954 edition. Still, given how much time it takes to research historical and governmental records, I would highly recommend this book. For every hour of microfilm research you do, I'm sure this book will save you ten."
2,Beautiful but cheap material,"I come from a family of cabinet makers so I've been around wood and wood products my whole life. While I understand that this is pressed wood I also know that it shouldn't crack as you place the screws in. Very disappointed with the quality of this piece. While finished it looks great, I know in the long run it won't last very long and will begin to fall apart."
5,Highly Satisfied,"Assembly instructions are thorough, but setup is time consuming. Product came as expected; free from dents or blemishes. Finish was a true cherry color. The only complaint I have would be the long door on the right doesn't hacve any cloth stoppers, so it is loud when swung shut. We used cut one of those round adhesive cloth pieces used for the bottoms of kitchen chairs and it seemed to work perfect. All-in-all, I'd highly recommend this to someone else."
4,Beautiful piece!!! LOVE IT!!!,"I would of given it 5 stars because it is so nice but it is very time consuming to put together and there were two holes that were not pre-drilled like it was supposed to be. However once it was finished it exceeding my expectations, gorgeous piece!!! WE love it and it is a great size- not cheap looking. This looks like you bought it at a fine furniture shop!!!"
3,"Nice dresser, scratches very easily","I love the look of this dresser/changing table combo unit. It was pretty easy to assemble and is a great size. However, it scratches very very easily (my cat jumped down off of it and scratches the drawer fronts beyond belief) so be very careful!! There are spaces between the drawer fronts and the dresser frame, which I do not like and the drawer pulls do not tighten all the way, so they spin when you pull them. I thought that my baby would have this dresser for a long time, but given the negative aspects, I doubt that will be the case. Otherwise, it looks very nice and is roomy. The company is great to work with; I ordered a replacement drawer face and customer service sent it out without an argument. Shipping takes a long time, but they are very nice and helpful to deal with!"
1,Warning: Don't buy from Storkcraft,"I purchased this item from another retailer and it arrived damaged. I followed the instructions and called Storkcraft to get replacement parts. They told me the parts would be here in 2-3 weeks. Now it is almost 5 weeks later and still no parts. I have called several times and have only gotten very unhelpful CSR's who say my order is at the warehouse but it hasn't been shipped yet. (Actually: The first one I talked to, a week and a half ago, said they were waiting on FedEx.)So, to sum it up...baby could be coming very soon...spent a couple hundred dollars...and as of yet, no changing table."
2,Looks nice but horrible quality,"So when you look at this, it looks really really nice. Putting it together was so easy! The problem is it is cheaply made. I assumed this would be a decent product since we bought the glider from stork craft and it is very nice. But this once it was put together wobbles. Also, some of the holes were put int the wrong area, so the drawers are not put in correctly and the other screws damaged the wood because of nail hole placement. It is really sad because it really looks nice. I love it with the crib I purchased. I just wish it was stronger. Because it wobbles I am not sure if I will use it as a changing table, which was my orginal plan. I guess people are right when they say by a nice used high end dresser or changing table. You pay the same but at least you will get quality. This isn't a quality item."
4,"Beautiful, but short drawers","A bit of time to put it together, but not too difficult. It works great as a changing table and is beautiful. My only complaint is how shallow (height-wise) the drawers are. The face of the drawers is much taller than the inside walls. Otherwise it's great."
4,Decent baby furniture,"Pros: sturdy, beautiful, and functional once it is built; definitely stores well all of my child's clothes, blankets, and diaper-changing supplies.Cons: Agree, it was a pain to put together; my husband spent the better half of a Sunday doing so. However, as long as the instructions are followed, there is little room for screw-ups. Also, the smell of the veneer lingered for a very long time - even after I wiped the entire piece down with cleaner, it still continued to emit a 'fresh paint' scent (or it's just my pregnant nose was exceptionally tuned to it). It took about 10 days for the smell to fully go away."
1,Very unhappy with quality,"This is definitely not a quality piece of furniture. I knew we were not buying top of the line, but I have purchased cheaper and more solid ""fake wood"" pieces from Target and Walmart. There are scratches all over the wood, and I definitely anticipate more. Unfortunately we were pressed for time, but I definitely do not recommend this piece to others."
3,Final product looked great but getting there is difficult,Received it this morning and took a few hours to get it together. I'm happy with how it looks but it actually took a bit of customisation to get there. Issues such as the rear wall holes do not quite line up and therefore if screwing in as directed the screws would split the wood and be visible. I got round this by slotting the holes on the panel that fits behing the cupboard section.Also fitting the rails to the draws gave me issues. I had to use smaller screws since the ones i was issued cause the wood to start splitting. I'm also a little annoyed about a few blemishes which are visible on the front of the chest. This was as received out of the box.If purchasing just take care.
5,"Yes, it's difficult to put together, but a great product!","I may be overly positive about this because my brother and sister put this together for me. I had read all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble, and so I had warned them. It sounded frustrating, for sure... the pictures weren't all correct and it took a long time, but they did not have to drill any additional holes or anything. We were missing on piece to screw in one of the drawer knobs, so we did have to go to the hardware store for that. One other minor complaint... be prepared for the changing pad to take up alot of the space on top... I thought I would have more room for other things.All that said, I really like this piece of furniture. It's beautiful. The day after it was put together, the dog jumped up against it and scratched it, but it's nearly impossible to see, which is a good thing for furniture in a child's room. It feels very sturdy and the drawers are a good size."
1,Don't Buy This Item - Very Poor Quality,"Very disappointed with the quality of this product when it arrived from Amazon. It was packaged well but the quality of the ""real wood"" is awful. It's particle board with at best a small wood coating on top. I know it's not the top of the line item but just know that you are buying a very low quality product that easily scratches. Also when I was building it, there are some drawer gliders already installed on two pieces. Well, the manufacturer didn't install them correctly and I had to remove and reinstall all the gliders in order for the drawers to close!If you're wanting a lower end product this is for you, otherwise I recommend going to a store first and checking out the product versus buying online. It'll save you disappointment in the end."
2,"Nice looking, but does not hold up well","We received this as a gift for our daughter (now 16 months). It's a very nice looking dresser, but has not stood up well to daily use. All of the drawer knobs have pulled off at one point or another, and we've had to request replacements. We've now had the dresser for so long that they're charging us for new knobs. Also, the door hinges have had to be re-tightened several times.The wood is soft, so any nick or ding is clearly visible. This is not a concern in a baby room, but the dresser will not hold up well to toddler abuse -- we picked it specifically so it could transition from a changing table to a dresser.It was perfect for what we wanted it for initially, but it's ridiculous to have to maintain a piece of furniture that keeps dropping pieces. We'll probably end up replacing it with a sturdier dresser when my daughter transitions to her own room, which completely defeats the purpose for us."
1,Do Not Purchase from this manufacture!,"I received the Aspen Combo Chest. I initially had this item as part of my baby registry but changed my mind. The person who purchased this item for me cancelled the order close to two weeks before it was delivered. The item was delivered regardless of the cancellation. I called Amazon to Return the item and they said I would need to deal directly with CYMAX STORES, INC. After several days of trying to get through to customer service they informed me that in order to ship it back I would be charged a re-stocking fee (even though the items has not been opened) of 25% as well as pay the shipping fee to send back and another fee to the manufacture for shipping. By the time the fees to return the item are calculated it is as almost as much as the cost of the item which is $240.00. I'm sure this is intentional to avoid returns. The Return process is not buyer friendly. BUYER BEWARE!!!!! You can go to the cytex.com site to check out the return policy."
3,"Good dresser, but tricky to put together","The dresser is reasonably good for the money. However, the instructions for assembly are incorrect (one step is incorrect in that the pictorial depiction of where the metal lug goes in and where a cylindrical bolt goes got the holes interchanged). Also the order of steps isn't always useful in cutting down time to build (I found interchanging some of the steps helped speed things up). The screws which go in bolting the rear board is the most time consuming. There are no drilled holes for you to screw into, and you can easily mis-align the screws.The dresser is really convenient though. The drawers are reasonably deep and the small closet shelf is really useful for storing diapers and wipes. Build quality is average. My DaVinci Kalani crib (which was more expensive) was very sturdy and finish was better. But this one does a reasonable job for the money."
3,Looks nice but a pain to assemble,"I bought this for my baby's room and now that it is finally assembled, it looks very nice. I imagine we will get a lot of use out of it. That being said, it took my husband 6+ hours total to assemble it. The parts aren't all what the diagram shows them to look like and it comes in what feels like 1000 pieces. The company was very helpful when I called but it took me forever (and one extremely confusing phone call) to get in touch with them. I would recommend but only if someone ELSE put it together."
4,"Looks Great, instructions difficult.","I love the dresser it looks really great and fit perfectly in the space. Our baby isn't here yet , however I have filled up all his drawers and do not anticipate any problems with it. Only gripe I had was it was difficult for my husband to put together. The instructions are vague and all the pieces were not labeled. For example, he put our crib together in a few hours after a long work day, he took three evenings to put this dresser together, probably 6-7hrs total. For now we are satisfied and I would recommend to a friend, but be prepared for the long assembly process!"
3,Get what you pay for..,"The directions are HORRIBLE. Overall I would say you get what you pay for, its a cheap dresser and the end product is cheap. The drawers don't roll well/the cabinet doesn't shut completely. But it is sturdy."
4,Good dresser,"Bought this dresser to match our Babi Italia Eastside Convertible Crib - Classic Cherry. Fairly heavy, solid construction for an assemble-at-home piece of furniture. It was pretty easy to put together. Fits a standard size changing pad with a little room left over for diaper changing products."
4,Nice dresser,"I ordered this dresser for my new grandson. I have not seen it in person because I had it sent directly to my son's house. This is such a convenient service for me! Luckily, it arrived when my son was home. It is very heavy, and the delivery person required help to unload and deliver it. My daughter-in-law is pregnant, so she was not able to help. My son and daughter-in-law are very pleased with the dresser."
4,Good solid dresser,"Picked up this dresser for our new nursery. Fairly heavy, solid construction for an assemble-at-home piece of furniture. It did take a while to put together (lots of pieces) but not complicated at all. All the wood pieces were numbered, so made it pretty easy. The antique white was just a little bit darker than the rest of our antique white furniture, from other places. But really only noticeable if pieces are side by side, which they aren't in our room, so it's not that big of a deal. Pretty happy with the purchase"
2,This dresser does not last,"At first, I thought the dresser was nice. It looked really good once we got it put together. It did take awhile, however, for my husband to get it together.This dresser is not good quality. We have had numerous problems with this dresser. Two of the drawers are constantly coming off the tracks. I don't like the fact that the changing table does not have a front lip/edge; it's a hazard in terms of my daughter falling off.I would not buy this dresser again. It is not worth the money at all"
2,Ok at first,"We got this dresser with the matching crib when I was pregnant with our first daughter. All of the parts were there and I was able to put it together with little difficulty (I was 8 1/2 months pregnant at the time, the only difficulty was working around the belly!). I have to say for the first year and a half to two years, it did the job. As time went on, I realized exactly why I hate furniture made with particle board or MDF... It won't hold screws when the drawer/door bracket they are securing are used often. I had to fill the screw holes a few times and try to reattach the door bracket and the glide that the drawers use. They will simply pull out after normal use. I would not recommend this or any product made from particle board MDF to anyone. For a little more money, you can get a lot more quality :)"
4,"Overall, a nice little piece of furniture for young ones.","We purchased this dresser and a matching armoire for our second child's nursery, which has no closet. This dresser was delivered in a timely manner and arrived in good condition. It took my husband about 2 hours to put together. The only complaint he had was that the pieces were not labled as illustrated in the instructions. Several pieces had no labels at all, so he could have been done sooner. The finished product is nice. We bought a Storkcraft crib and another dresser three years ago for my son, and it's lasted pretty well with few scratches and dents. The drawers are not very deep but work fine for baby clothes. We got that the matching armoire as well. Same problem with the labels and I was disappointed that it didn't come with a hanging rod, but we bought a shower curtain tension rod that works fine."
3,"Good, if you are lucky","IF YOU GET ALL PARTS IN ORDER.Ours had some problems, but fixable with the help of Lowes' parts and tools.I am fairly happy with the look and feel of the item. Shallow drawers don't make the item worse - it is distance between them that makes me think that dust might get into drawers. But overall it looks nice and seems useful/"
4,"Looks nice, but drawers are small","Looks lovely when fully assembled - though it doesn't at all match the crib which was supposed to be the same stain. The drawers are much shallower than the drawer fronts, so capacity is limited. Took about 4 hours for my husband to assemble - directions are a little tricky, but probably could have done in 2 hours if we had a power drill."
3,Ok for the money,"Nice dresser for the money. Whatever they package it with left lightly noticeable tape like marks on it. Had to buy some touch up paint to cover the ones I couldn't wipe off. I have to agree with the other reviews regarding the assembly, not a easy task took several hours."
3,Made out of cheap materials,"The changing table is made out of cheap materials, and is difficult to assemble. Luckily my husband can do carpentry and made all the pieces fit,but if you are not married to a carpenter or know one. Do Not Buy this Changing Table!!!!!"
3,It's ok not the best,"We bought this for our granddaughter. My husband puts furniture togather for a living. It tooka long time to put togather. Parts were not labled properly. Some parts were already put togather, but the screws were put in crooked, so the the drawers don't close. It looks nice matches the crib and changing table. But was a pain in the but to put togather."
2,poor quality,"As mentioned in other reviews the instructions are bad and the pictures and hardware don't necessarily match the guide.The visible pieces are nice but the drawers and inside pieces are made of really poor particle board...sub-par even for particle board. If you are buying this as a changing table to use for a year or two it might last that long. If you want it as a dresser that will last beyond that, spend your money on something else. The finish scratches very easily also."
4,Good dresser,"Shipping was quick, it arrived in-tact, and was easy to put together. There were no scratches or dents and it looks nice in our nursery. My one critique is that the drawers could be deeper. They are only half as deep as the front piece for no good reason I can see. It would greatly increase the capacity of the dresser if the drawer sides were as deep as the front piece."
4,Great Dresser for Our Little Girl!,"This dresser was the perfect choice for us...we wanted a dresser that would grow with our newborn.. It was not hard to put together but it did take a couple hours because of the amount of pieces that had to be put together.. I think that is understandable, after all you are getting a large dresser in a box... It looks wonderful and solid when it is complete.. Very happy with this purchase..great price, for a solid piece of furniture which will grow with our little girl for quite a long time.."
2,Dresser Chest Combo,The dresser was a pain to put together but looks good once assembled. The quality however is not good. Anytime we try moving it the whole thing starts coming apart. The draws also don't hold up if you have heavy clothes in them. Looks good but quality is lacking.
2,Nice looking but came damaged,"This dresser looks exactly like it is in the picture. I would give this 4 stars but the front piece has scratch about 6 inches long plus little damages here and there in some other pieces. This dresser could never be sold in the stores with scratches like these except for the outlet ones.As for the instruction. Yes, it's horrible. 80% of the pieces have no numbers. And there are only pictures instruction, no words. It is not too hard to assemble it, but it could save you a lot of time if you don't have to guess which pieces is which. Of course if your job is to do this everyday, you would know it right away. It took me about 4 hours which could have been 2 if the instruction were better.I do not want to give it back after spending a lot of time putting it together, but I'm not satisfy with the quality so not recommend it to anyone. This company needs to stop sending damage items to customers."
4,"Nice looking, but horrible to assemble","This is a very nice looking dresser for the price, but I have to say that it took my husband and I 3 hours to put together. There are no written instructions, just pictures, which would be fine if the manufacturer labeled the pieces correctly. It's clear that whomever created the instructions never had to actually put the dresser together. Other than that, we are really happy with the way it looks."
4,Dresser/Changer,"Not too bad to put together although it does have a LOT of pieces! The worst thing was how soft the wood is, you have to be careful the way you put the screws in, especially for the back panels (and yes, it's a bunch of screws and not nails for these back panels) because they'll end up breaking off pieces of the dresser if it comes out too close to the edge. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase! It looks great all together and has a lot of space =)"
3,"OK, for the price","The oak color is an exact match to the crib and changing table. That was nice too see. It took over 3 hours to assemble (with 2 people) however it seems pretty sturdy. 2 main complaints... The drawers appear to be deep based on the picture. I was very disappointed when we assembled the drawers. The sides and backs of the drawers are about half the depth of the front wooden piece. They are very shallow. I suppose I can stack clothes carefully and hope to take advantage of the wasted space. I have no idea why they designed the drawers this way. Also, the top is narrow and would make a dangerous changing table. My baby could slip off the front.Time will tell how it holds up structurally."
5,Great for a small nursery!,"We had a great experience with this dresser/changing table.It was very easy to put together, looks really good and saves a lot of space in our nursery. No missing parts, no damage what-so-ever and no need to ""drill new holes"".The drawers are shallow, for an adult/older child, but you're putting baby clothing into them! I can fit about 20 sleep & play PJ sets plus socks in the top drawer alone. Deep drawers just aren't necessary for such small clothing!What I love about the top portion (changing table) is that is has enough room for our changing pad and an organizer to hold all our diapers/lotions/creams.Generally I've found that Stork Craft products are very nice quality and very budget friendly."
1,HORRIBLE,This product is horrible and I do not recommend anyone to purchase this. I new it would be a challenge to put together but none of the pieces were labeled so it was impossible to assemble.
1,terrible,"This product was purchased as a gift for us... the instructions only have visual, no written instructions for assembly. The majority of the parts/pieces are not labelled or do not match labelling in the instruction booklet. It took my husband two days to assemble because he got so frustruated. The wood pieces are mostly particle board so the screws go through wrecking the wood. The drawer bottoms and backing are flimsy. The wood is easily scratched so we had to touch it up with alot of stain marker."
4,Bigger than I thought- in a good way!,"I was pleasantly surprised that this changing table was wider than I was expecting. It turned out so cute and was fairly easy to put together. I love the drawers underneath, I didn't have to buy a dresser and clutter up the babies room. It isnt the most solid wood, but very nice for the price. I would certainly reccomend this product. It was much less from Amazon than what I had priced at Target and Babies R Us."
4,"pretty, sturdy","I was so excited to receive this item and put together for our upcoming son's arrival! The shipping time was a little more than anticipated, and it was difficult to put together which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five. The cabinet doesn't line up perfectly and there is a gap, but all in all it is very pretty and matches our crib and glider perfectly! Some reviews I read said it isn't a sturdy piece of furniture, but I think it is very much sturdy."
3,"Nice dresser, difficult assembly","This dresser, once assembled, works nicely as a child's dresser/ changing table combo. It's not anything fancy but looks pretty nice in the room. What we hated about it were the assembly instructions. Parts were not all labeled and one or two were incorrectly labeled. Also, the pictures for assembly were poor and had hardly any written instructions. We probably would not buy this again unless we found it somewhere fully assembled."
2,Wouldn't purchase this a second time,"This changing table combo dresser was purchased for us as a gift, and while it will serve it's function, I would not recommend it to a friend, nor will I be purchasing a second one.Directions were what I expected at this price point, but still not too helpful and confusing at times. Holes in some drawings were on the bottom side of the piece but shown on the topside.Some of the tightening pieces, pull the wood apart.When installing the back fiberboard panels which give the piece some rigidity, several of the screws missed the tiny ledge and angled into the storage space.Harder than it should have been to build, not as good as IKEA product, but I suppose you get what you pay for."
1,"Poor design, received defective product - Get less than what you pay for!","This dresser was a nightmare to put together, and required more than 3 hours of work due to the lack of clear instructions, poor design, and defective parts. One of the pieces I received had pegs incorrectly glued into it! It looks like a previous purchaser had the same issue putting together the dresser and returned the parts, which were then resold to me! For this amount of money, I should have received at least a functional piece of furniture, but what I received was already broken and flimsy. Buyer beware!!! Spend the extra money and buy a quality piece! This is junk!!"
1,Cheaply made,"I think how someone rates a product is all based on what they expect.Here are the pros and cons that I saw and you can decide if you would rate it high or low.Pros:- Looks decentCons:- Made of MDF aka particle board. Its not wood.- Because of the glue in the MDF, it smells like glue. It's been airing out in the room for 1 week now and still smells. Hopefully it will air out.- Bought espresso and also bought an espresso colored crib by storkcraft, and the colors don't match. This is probably b/c the dresser is MDF material with an espressor veneer on it and the crib is stained wood.- The parts to put things together are cheap.Overally, we're stuck with it. I'm not too happy about the purchase. If you're okay with MDF furniture, then maybe this will work for you. It's equivalent to Ikea in terms of material quality, parts used, and how it's assembled."
1,"TERRIBLE - wasted a day on this, and had to return anyway","Okay, this dreser is a good price and looks nice in the picture. The parts arrived in good condition too. HOWEVER, you do not want to waste your money on this. It was a disaster. The instructions are terrible, holes are predrilled wrong, etc. However, despite that, we got it together. BUT, it was so, so wobbly. It would sway back and forth by barely touching it. You would never want to put your baby on this dresser with how wobbly it was! And the drawers were terrible - wouldnt line up correctly and there were gaps where they didnt line up with sides of the dresser. Ultimately, after spending the day putting it together, we had to take it apart at 9 pm, pack it back up, and return it to Amazon for a refund. It was a total waste of time and really frustrating. We ended up buying a better quality changing dresser from jcp.com - it was $100 more but arrived FULLY ASSEMBLED and looks awesome in our nursery."
4,parts are not labeled,Now that it is together we love it...but it was a little confusing to assemble! The parts werent labeled which ended up taking a little extra time! Overall tho its beautiful!
1,disappointed,"This product was difficult to put together, and then didn't fit together well. The drawers bump the door and there is no room for error. The holes are pre-drilled, and it you try to drill the material it crumbles and then is unrepairable. Very disappointed in the quality, would not recommend. To return would take more time to dismantle and then put back into box, what a waste of time and money."
1,Disappointed(but not for the reason you think),"It wasn't very helpful actually because instead of the Math B Power Pack they sent me the Math A Power Pack. I won't write about how much I was disappointed that I received the wrong item because in the end I decided to keep it and give it away to someone who needed it. However, please be careful that when you order something it is exactly what you want."
5,mile 27 and beyond,"Makes me proud to be a marathoner. Knowing the Boston course all too well, I was able to know where they were and think of myself there too. The final few moments on Hereford St... Boylston St... coming over the last hill at BC and seeing the city below, the surreal start in Hopkington...etc. Living in the Boston area in 1982 and struggling on a track team with a coach and team I hated, I remember this race and the excitement that built over the 2 hrs of Dick's & Salazar's journey...all of eastern Mass was behind them.Years later and a few marathons under my own elastic belt, I profoundly connected with this story again when it excerpted in Runner's World and I think it appeals to runners and non runners alike, and anyone who has struggled with addiction and depression. But mostly distance runners will get this.John Brant's writing style is melodramatic, but it works. All races are stories but this one is an epic poem."
1,Disappointed,"I am not sure if it was completely stated when I was shopping, but this book had SEVERE water damage done to it - has some black mold on it as well. Disappointed - not sure I could sell this (albeit it was $2 or $3) with an honest heart."
4,Very good but short and sometimes repetitive.,"This book tells two stories. The first is a recap of the 1982 ""Duel in the Sun"" Boston Marathon in which Alberto Salazar and Dick Beardsley run within inches of one another for the entire race - arguably the most exciting distance race ever.The second story tells about the lives of the two very different men - both of which face their own failures and triumphs.Both stories are interesting but in my opinion could have been more in depth. I read the book in a little over one day. The book was rather thin to begin with and the font was quite large and often there would be a blank page between chapters. Also there were some things, especially in the stories of the men's lives, that were repeated multiple times. I felt that it read more like a very long magazine article rather than a book."
3,Semper Fi,"The first half of the film illustrates how important the air support was in the battle of Khe Sanh. I found it to be interesting how supplies and fire power was used by these planes. It was fascinating how the US held off the NVA, which out numbered the marines by 6:1. The second half is early footage of the war (1965) with the marines seaching for the Viet Cong, which I didn't find as interesting. The tape is old government footage, a bit of propaganda, but still very informative. I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about the marines' role in the Vietnam war."
4,I bought for the case,"I haven't used the bits, that's not why I made the buy, but the case is quite nice and sturdy for my good bits that were housed in a worn out case."
4,good price and a great case,"I do very light drilling around the house so I really just want a set of various bits that can handle the occasional jobs. this set fits the bill for a very affordable price. The best thing about this set is actually the case, compact, sturdy, and holds the bits tightly."
2,Only a Few Shine,"As with many short story collections, only a few will shine. Namely, Auspicious Stars by Jane Lindskold and Soul Cages by Carol Rondou. A neat idea is presented in Caretaking by Nina Kiriki Hoffman and How It All Began by Esther Friesner. Maybe not worth the full price tag but a good library checkout."
1,Black Cats and Broken Mirrors,"Four Words: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! The title is an excuse for a poorly organized anthology. While the stories share a common theme of superstition, most are poorly written and a few are downright disgusting (""Dead Tired"" comes to mind!). There are a few good standouts (""How It all Began"", ""Whirlwinds""). If you really want to read this, visit the library."
2,Was not really pleased with this one,"The cover is very small and did not fit my wheel.As if that weren't bad enough- the grip looks EVEN froma distant to be made of some cheap rubbery-plastic material.The stitches are painfully obvious and it looks as if thecompany that made them did not try at all to conceal them.Hardly what I'd call elegant.If you have a really small steering wheel and need a cover, Ireally don't recommend this one."
5,Good value,"I have recently starting buying by volume and Amazon is a terrific spot to do so, especially with the free shipping, costs, time, gas and the hassle of crowds.. Ultra Charmin is by far the best IMO.. This is a really good deal, arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
2,clogging bathroom tissue,"The service , shipping and post purchase service at Amazon are outstanding,however, I regret to say, this Charmin bathroom tissue rates as the one product most likely to clog the toilet !"
4,Charmin Ultra Soft Bathroom Tissue (Giant Rolls),"I have used the Giant Size rolls of Charmin Ultra Soft Bathroom Tissues for years. However, most stores do not sell the giant size (without scent), and Amazon (as usual) came to my rescue. I've been using Amazon for sometime for this need, and the box always arrives in a very timely manner."
5,BEST TOILET PAPER ON THE MARKET,This is just about the only place to purchase this choice in the brand.Worth every penny.
2,Grandma Belva,"Not something I would recommend. Interesting enough to keep me reading but I did not find the characters to be ""real"". The main character Lynn was barely likeable. She was so old fashioned it seems Belva might have fashioned her after herself rather than a woman of that day & age. Weak, timid, closed off, even in her private thoughts. The one true thing that kept me going was that one of these times she would fight back get mad, even, strong, whatever. Never happened. She even gave the jerk back all the jewelry he had bought her over the years. COME ON! Of course yes, she made it through everthing she did still gracious and loving and bla bla bla. She may have handled the situation in the most ""moral"" way she could have but hey, that's not real."
4,Well-written - compelling story!,"This is a new take on the sad story of spousal abuse. Belva Plain's description of the husband makes you realize how easy it becomes for some women to stay in these kinds of marriages. I actually like the character - he wasn't portrayed as some crazy monster. And unlike one of the other reviews, I didn't think the end was predictable at all! Plain introduces a couple male characters towards the end and it was up in the air as to what course her love life would take!"
2,Disappointed.,"UNFORTUNATELY, when I rec'd the book it WAS NOT large print as my order indicated as well as the packing slip. Therefore, it was returned. Maybe someone can get the order correct next time."
3,Very well written,This is my first experience with her novels. I was very impressed. I thought the author depicted a great summary of domestic violence. I will definitely try some of her other novels.
2,MOst of it was predictable and I didn't like the ending.,"I started out liking the book, but at about the middle, I was disappointed in it. I felt the husband really should have been given another chance, and I wanted them to go into counseling and stay together. I do believe he DID really love his Family, and it would have been much better to show the triumph of working it out in the end, and him overcoming his fear, and anger. I did not like Lynn ( the wife), and the fact she went with Bruce! Why must EVERY book have to mention SEX??? Can't we once read a moral book where people do not cheat on each other. Robert didn't cheat on Lynn. She abandonded HIM!! And that he was NEVER heard from again was a total disapointment to me! I sure didn't like the ending."
4,Great Ideas!,"If you're looking to travel around the world without being a tourist, this book is a good start. It lists numerous volunteer gigs (some paid, some not) around the world and is divided into sections first by area of the world, and second by type of work. Many of the jobs provide room/board/stipend if you pay for your travel (yet, some cover that too). So, if you have a year (or even less) to travel, this would be a good way to do it. Being a part of the community and living and learning the culture is a richer experience than tourist'ing through!"
3,Non Fiction,"Beach volleyball books now? What will they think of next? Anyway, this one is pretty much a nobrainer for a publisher I would think, given the success of the player involved, particularly with her partner, an all the medals they picked up. Especially if you include the odd photo to keep certain fans happy. I am not really interested, but for some reason my wife was given this book, so I will generally have a look at sport stuff. It wasn't too bad, standard sort of thing."
3,arrived mostly as described,it arrived as described except there were some highlighter marks and notes written within the pages. otherwise it was in good shape.
5,Great Movie!,"This movie was a surprise! It was actually really good. Nothing can top the original, but it is a good second piece. You should check it out!!!"
3,Lost Boys-TribeR,"This movie was okay I guess. It bothered me because I guess I was looking forward to the other original characters from ""The Lost Boys"". However, the movie was good for the most part. I can see why it did not make the theaters though."
1,"Bad, Bad and oh yeah Bad","Why insult a movie like The Lost Boys, I loved this movie the sequel is a total dud, Why even put Corey Haim in the credits, hes in it like 20 seconds, Corey Feldman is the only Good thing about this movie, Love the Coreys, and why do directord think nudity has to be in a movie, I want to see more story less nudity in movies.Bottom line if u loved the original this one will leave you with a BAD taste in your mouth"
3,not the original but still ok,"you know whats strange is that after reading the reviews on this, i expected it to be almost painful to watch. but i was pleasantly surprised. by no means was a great, especially the the beginning. there was unnecessary gore to open the movie and one other part. and they swear weirdly, like how middle schoolers do.but the guy who played shane reminded me of the original lost boys. the rest of his little group suxed. but it was ok. and i lved the return of the frog brother. and i lve the remix of ""cry little sister."""
2,:(,"Loved Lost Boys but this movie was just plain awful. The two main leads were likeable enough but the actors they chose to be the vampires were really bad. They weren't ""cool"" at all...especially the lead vamp guy. Even Corey Feldman was annoying in this and I usually like him. I think this sequel failed."
2,Less than average - sort of boring,See the title of this review. Nothing horrific about it. Could have been much better.
1,utterly ridiculous!!!!,"I'm not even sure what to say I'm speechless.This is possible the worst movie I've EVER seen. the 1st one is my fave movie of all time and I figured if Feldman and Kiefer's little bro were in it then it can't be all bad. God, was I wrong.The acting was HORRIBLE, had exact same story as the 1st, 1 sibling fighting for the other, a crazy relative saying random stuff. Honestly, I'm embarrased maybe was it made to be a joke or were they serious. Feldman had the same lines as he did in the 1st one and whats his name Angus had the same lines kiefer used in the 1st one. Ive never laughed so hard and I'm kinda pissed. I really wanted it to be a great movie,don't waste your money. This is the 1st time I've ever posted my own review so that should tell you something!!"
1,Even worse than I expected,"I really like the first movie, though I recognize that it is a case of nostalgia because I was about 19 or so when it came out.After looking at the plot summary, I didn't have much hope for a good film, but I thought that I would give it a chance. I made a mistake. The acting was mediocre in the best parts and non-existant in others. The real disappointment was the writing. This was the most boring and predictable horror movie that I've ever seen."
1,was NOT worth the wait,I waited so long for a seq. to lost boys and this is the best they could come up with?. I don't want to ruin what little plot there is for people that want to see it. I will say it had some good blood and gore in some scenes. My best advice is not to buy it but to rent.
1,Horrible,"Wow, all I have to say is that if you're an original Lost Boys fanatic like myself, then don't even waste your time w/ this film. The acting was horrible, the vampires were geeks, they weren't cool and ""edgey"" like the original Lost Boys, someone needs to mail Joel Schumaker a copy of this garbage and hopefully he will redo his original version or something!!"
2,lots of blood and humor,"well i got to say this was one interesting movie. but not interesting because it was attention grabbing.(i fell asleep immediately the 1st attempt to watch it) but the 2nd time i must admit i was wide awake and payed closed attention.i would say the movie lack imagination creativity and meaning. the good thing is there was a lot of blood and gore but i guess when you saw the origional lost boys you really have have to try hard to understand why this movie wasnt as good as that one. long story short, if you're in the mood for blood and plenty of laughs, see this movie. however you must have an open mind. but definitly do not buy it.. rent it if anything.."
3,Lost Boys Return!,"Alright. I had my doubts. After watching this movie I give it a 3 out of 5. The script had the right idea but it could have used more of that original ""umph"" that the first flim had. Not to mention Haim is an ""after thought"" not really part of the movie. Feldman overacts, as usual. BUT, that's to be expected... after all, Lost Boys is kinda campy. However, I was impressed with Angus Sutherland. His presence was very well done even if he could have used more lines and a better death scene. Overall, it's worth watching just for the funny campy-ness of Feldman and the little after thought of Haim."
2,"Warner Bros. ""Lost"" It","The first movie was made on a shoestring budget and not expected to do very well. Well it did and given its popularity and status as a ""cult classic"" one would think Warner Bros. would've put more thought behind the creation of a sequel. Obviously whoever was in charge of that particular department was asleep on the job because this movie stunk. It's not even good enough to be deemed a remake or stand alone title.The plot was shallow, the acting was so-so (Feldman over-acted big time), and the story generally stunk. J. Schumacher was right; this movie should never have been made. Also, Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for making it."
3,3.5 stars for the whole movie,"It's not quite as bad as it first may look like. It certainly lacks the right things like form the first or the third movies, but I wouldn't call it bad. More like fine choice for a boring afternoon. The acting wasn't bad, special effects were fine. The movie itself lacks this special ''souce''. To be called interesting, it needed to be different. Not a bad movie choice, however I will not watch it twice. Still give it a try. And judge the movie for yourself."
2,Not Worth Bothering With...,"This movie really falls flat compared to the original. Angus Sutherland makes for a very dull and unconvincing leader of the vampires. He and Autum Reeser have very little on-screen chemistry, yet we are to believe that she falls for him. The plot is incredibly predictable and unoriginal. The film fails to make you care about any of the characters. The production values are good, and the acting is decent, but the story is not at all engaging. In short, there is a good reason this one went straight to video - it's completely lackluster. Do yourself a favor and pass on this film..."
1,DISASTER!!!,"I LOVE THE FIRST 'LOST BOYS' AND GAVE THE BENEFIT OF DOUBT MAKING A SEQUEL TO A CLASSIC. HOWEVER I CAN'T AVOID THE TRUTH.....THIS MOVIE WAS AN UTTER DISASTER!!!! EVERYTHING FROM THE LAME PLOT TO THE TERRIBLE ACTING!! IF I WAS COREY FELDMAN I WOULD NOT WANT MY NAME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE AND YOU THINK HE WOULD OF SAW THAT IN THE SCRIPT!! SORRY, I WANTED TO LIKE IT..... BUT I HAVE TO TELL IT STRAIGHT...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,not as good as the first,"no where near as good, funny, goofy, creativ as origianl but i liked it caus you see people you havent seen in amovie in years, faces you may of heard of or not seen since the early 90s etc it had its moments, but plot wise the first wasy way better but again it had its moments"
1,Porn Or Vampires,"The first Lost Boys movie was superb! They didn't need to show any skin to make it a great movie. It seems that the directors think they have to always show off the lovely female anatomy to get any rankings on any movie. WHAT GIVES??? I personally didn't think this matched up at all. Granted Angus Sutherland is a great actor, but it is too bad the movie itself stunk.I think making part II to 99% of original movies is always a disappointment"
2,Edgar Frogg Rocks!,"I knew what I was getting into going into this movie. It wasn't going to be good, but it's vampires so what the heck. The problem with this movie is that the characters were so bland you couldn't really care about them. The movie lacked the humor and the ""cool"" of the original. However, Corey Feldman was a treat. His appearance in this movie was pure bliss. The soundtrack was also less than memorable. Angus Sutherland's Shane was not bad, but no way was he as cool as Keifer's David. All in all in wasn't bad, but it can't touch the original."
4,awesome.,"I must admit, it was actually good. There have been a lot of nay sayers, but the movie was an exciting and scary ride. Cory Feldman was awesome, I hope that his performance in this movie helps to revive his film career. He was as iconic and memorable as he was in the original, kicking serious vampire butt and taking no prisoners.The Lost Boys 2 isn't just all nostalgia, though. Newcomers Tad Hilgenbrink and Autumn Reeser round out the stellar cast, breathing new life into this ageless coming-of-age story.Bottom line, the movie is 94 minutes of awesome. The special effects were somewhat cheesy, but that made it fun, it also has a great soundtrack. Overall, the movie has everything you remember and love about the first one but with a new twist, not leaving any viewer disapointed. Autumn Reeser is sexy, Cory is awesome, and there is enough gore and exploding heads to make everyone happy.All I'm going to say is that I hope it gets the response it deserves to pave the way for one more."
1,A complete waste of time,"Turned this off half way through, this movie isn't a patch on the first. Many like myself looked forward to this sequel because of the lively style and the fresh feel of the first (the first was actually entertaining). Why would the producers of this one think we want to watch something so different. This was not a 'Lost Boys' sequel, this was a miserable dark, gratuitously violent, over sexualized (for time filler I suspect) movie trying to get success using the name and setting of the first. I wish I had rented it first, then I would not feel so bad having wasted my money on the dvd. This gets a generous one reluctant star rating from me, and the one star belongs to Corey Feldman, without whom this movie would not have any rateable merit. That is my opinion anyway."
3,What do you think.,"Could this movie have been worse. Maybe if you take out the surfing, skateboarding, motorcycle's, and a classic car here and there. The background, like the ocean view's is the best part of the hole thing. The acting is just plain bad. You got a couple of funny line's along the way but there few and far between. Gabriella Rose is pretty believable, and Tom Savini makes a good showing. But Jamison Newlander's entire role is cut from the movie. He is listed in the finale credits but isn't in the show. Thought it was suppose to be the uncut version. Borrow it before you buy. Some people thought it way cool. You might to. The dvd has some extras. Music video, stuff like that. In a lot of way's the extras is what pushed it up to three stars. That and the set design's were somewhat interesting."
3,Where's Corey Haim?,"I watched this because I loved the first one and I heard the two Coreys were in it. Well, Feldman did a good job playing Edgar Frog again, but I totally missed Corey Haim. His part is only a few seconds long and it's after the end credits. Too bad, I was looking forward to seeing more Haim.The story line is good and at least you get to know what happend with Sam and Edgar from the first film. Just be aware that this movie has a A LOT of blood, gore, slime and body parts. It's totally gross! And that ruined it for me, but if you like that stuff you'll probably enjoy this."
5,Sink your teeth in!,"Look, is this a five star movie? No. It is a three star movie. I gave it five to help try and get the overall rating up closer to the three it deserves. This movie does not have the all charm, fun and fright of the first, but it is an enjoyable trip down memory lane for those who loved the first one. The script is a bit of a let down, as it is essentially the same story all over again. What saves the movie are the surprisingly good performances by the three leads: cute and sexy Autumn Reeser, the unfortunately named Tad Hilgenbrink, and of course, Corey ""Frog"" Feldman. It was interesting to see the younger Sutherland playing Keifer's old role, but he doesn't have the chops, if you'll excuse the pun. He's a little too smooth, which eliminates the danger factor.So, overall, I say if you enjoyed the first one, get this one too.Just don't expect it to be as good, and you can enjoy the surprise of having it not totally suck."
2,"I wish they didn't have ""The Lost Boys"" in the title","I really wish this was better. As a huge Lost Boys fan, this movie felt like a slap in the face. This movie isn't even that great on its own. Skip it"
3,Somebody explain this....,"In the end credits, it clearly says ""Alan Frog Jamison Newlander""...??? So where is he? If he wasn't in the movie, he would not be in the credits, but having watched it twice, I cannot find the guy. Anybody know what the deal is with this?"
1,What a shame....,I want to forget that this movie even exists. Somehow it even ruined the first movie for me. I wish I never watched it.
1,Probably the worst movie ever.,"This is probably the worst movie ever. Twenty (thirty?) years later with an entirely different cast (other than poor Corey) and a lame plot, this movie should not even be able to bear the title The Lost Boys. Don't even bother watching it. Seriously."
2,Bitterly disapointing,"The original was a hit, the sequel is a shallow imitation. Putting aside the glaring errors (vampires seen in reflections for example) the story is a hopeless rehash of the first with two new (and boring) teens encountering a pack of vamps against a beach backdrop. It lacks the humour, charm and suspense of the original and replaces it with cheap photography, cheap effects and cheap acting. What were the Coreys thinking!"
2,SKIP THIS JUNK!!!,"If u grew up in 80s , U WOULD dislike this new JUNK!!! Just trashy looks and language, with over the TOP unecessary blood shed, With that 'cory feldman' His doing the same as a teenager act in original LOST BOYS he was 15/16yo ,YA was silly/funny & cute back then , But not now, his 40yo!. Just lame & desperate !..The first LOST BOYS one of my FAV 80s flick, watched many times , With that sweet scrip, cast with AWSOME SOUNDTRACK!.any ages loved it! This is just made for these days jr.high schooler.If u curious like I was, just rent it, one time viewing then forgettable pretty quick Nothing special!! C"
3,Great Movie,"I was so hyped to hear that there was going to be another Lost Boys. Although it turned out to be a pretty good movie, I was somewhat disappointed by the fact that Corey Haim was not in it. I am a huge Cory Haim and Corey Feldman fan. I grew up watching them.After seeing the T.V. series ""The Two Coreys"" I was not surprised though. Haim was so messed up he could not get the lines right. It is always so hard to see good actors loose their edge!I was so happy to learn that at the end of the movie, he made a breif appearance (about 15 secounds), and also a small part in the bonus alternate endings feature of the DVD."
3,It's fairly entertaining. It's worth watching once.,"There's nothing original about the plot. It contains a lot of gore. The special effects are mixed. In some scenes they look scary. In other scenes, they look obviously fake. There are some interesting scenes with motor bikes. Yes, I agree most of the dialogues from the Vampire Slayer are ridiculous.It's still worth watching once if you like vampire movies."
3,Could have really sucked!,"As a sequal to the now legendary original...this movie falls way...way...way short. But as a stand alone for the folks who don't know or have not seen the original, this direct to dvd release has enough to keep you entertained. With it's attractive young cast, it's use of gore, and the return of Edgar Frog..I would be lying if I said it wasn't a guilty pleasure."
3,Okay but a bit anti-climactic for my tastes.....,"I read another review where someone said the only ""Oh man!"" moments came after the credits and I agree. They really should have focused more on the frog backstory. The fight at the end was ridiculous and over WAY too fast. Another thing...why was Corey Haim not featured more in this movie? That and his ultimate fate just made me wanna say this movie didn't happen,it was an alternate reality or it definitely needs to be redone. If only someone had let me write and produce a proper sequel to a most beloved cult classic. Don't make the mistake I did. Rent don't buy! You were warned. Lol."
5,Rock and Roll!!,"This is one of my favorite rock CDs but there should have beenmore on the CD. Solid Rock I love is not on here, why? Anyway,here's how the songs are on the CD!1. CALLING ELVIS - Nice vocals and guitar riffs!2. WALK OF LIFE - Better rock than studio!3. HEAVY FUEL - The best on the album! Really hard rocking.4. ROMEO AND JULIET - Best on CD! Way better than Alchemy or MM.5. PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS - Heavy metal at its best!!6. YOUR LATEST TRICK - Who cares about the bongos?7. ON EVERY STREET - boring! Listen to the other veresion!8. YOU AND YOUR FRIEND - boring!9. MONEY FOR NOTHING - Great version of the song! Better on BIA.10. BROTHERS IN ARMS - Great guitar riffs.I easily get tired of this CD after listening to 5 tracks!If you want a good cd, pick this one or Love over Gold."
3,"sounds so polished to be live, but good","I like the CD but it sounds so polished that it is sorta hard to believe that it is live.when one hears a talented guitar player like MK playing live... once would like to hear him stretch out the song, or play his solo a bit longer and maybe embellish the song for the delight of the audience. Nothing like that happens on this recording.That is not to say that this recording is not good, for it is great but, it is so much like the original recordings.. you could really accomplish the same thing by just buying a best of Dire Straits CD (of which there are a couple to select from)."
5,Great Live Show Better Together With The DVD,"Great live recording from Dire Straits. Where the hell is BUGor SOLID ROCK. Those are from the DVD and those were great.Anyway, the rest of the CD is great. Here's how the songs are.1. Calling Elvis - Great!!!!!2. Walk of Life - One of my favorites. Rocks way better than studio.3. Heavy Fuel - My favorite song!! Very great song, repeat.4. Romeo and Juliet - The greatest song!! My favorite. Repeat.5. Private Investigations - Great. Really heavier than studio.6. Your Latest Trick - Newer than studio. Still gets boring.7. On Every Street - Studio is slightly best.8. YOu and YOur Friend - The studio is slightly the best.9. Money for Nothing - Great, another big hit though the studiois the best.10. Brothers in Arms - Sad song though this version is the best."
3,This Really is Not Dire Straits at their Best,"I know there is a tendency to vote an unfavorable view of a review when you feel it is disrespecting a band that you love. Look, nobody loves Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler more than me, have every album. However, this is a very questionable CD. Recorded as they toured ""On Every Street,"" the playlist is odd. Of course the boys had done other live albums, which had covered great songs not on this album, but still. Many of the songs chosen for this album are soft and not really ""concert"" tunes. So many really good songs that have never made it to a live CD are ignored. And then there is the horn playing, too much of it. This album is not the Dire Straits I grew up on. It is too overproduced, there are too many musicians on stage and the playlist is weak. I give it three stars because of my loyalty to the band, but this album seems like nothing more than a quick buck by a record comapny."
1,On the Night-Live,"I would like to give a review but the order I placed 26/4/2011 is yet to arrive(as at 30/5/2011)Seems to be takeing a long time as I order two Cd's on consecutive days, and the other one came about 2 weeks ago."
3,Good Way to Go Out,"Basically their last album as a working band, this live overview is taken from the tour that backed 1991's On Every Street album. Mostly comprised of material from the band's last two releases (although you can't avoid yet another workout on ""Romeo and Juliet,"" this one almost two minutes longer than the live Alchemy version), Dire Straits sound loose and relaxed. The real treats are the live versions of standout songs from Brothers in Arms, particularly ""Walk of Life."" Knopfler is in fine voice and the playing is tight and intuitive, if characteristically meandering (it takes 10 1/2 minutes to get through ""Calling Elvis"" on the opener). But it's all about mood and atmosphere and On The Night fits in comfortably in their catalog alongside Alchemy. It's an unremarkable (hence 3 stars rather than four) but satisfying farewell serving, essentially the equivalent of a double LP at 75+ minutes."
5,Dire Straits Rock!,"Knopfler knows how to pick. He keeps to a minimum, guitar screeching, and goes for out and out great picking!. They know how to pick the audience up and bring them down gently when needed! One of my great disappointments is that I never saw them live. Although, this CD is probably the next best thing. Try it, you'll love it!!"
3,Observances & Philosophical Insights From A Fine Poet.,A series of poems from one of Mexico's best prose writers presented here showing his skill in the medium of verse.His best poems are the one's with intense lyrical touch; a highlight of grandeur & marvel at the poet's relationship with the creation of the word & the world around him. The best works lie in the shorter efforts.My rating for this is 3 & a half stars.
2,Several songs about killing animals,"I bought this CD for my toddler daughter in an effort to branch out from the usual children's music. Musically, the songs are fun to listen to. But a closer listen to the lyrics was off-putting for me.A number of the songs are centered around hunting, i.e. killing tigers, bears, geese. I am not anti-hunting (provided it is done responsibly) but I don't particularly want to sing songs about killing animals with my 2 year old! Particularly since we tend to sing along and she really pays attention to the words. If you share this sentiment, I would avoid this CD."
4,Cute!,"We love Johnny Cash. I probably have all these songs on different CDs or downloads, but I bought the album for my son's Easter basket anyway. Looking forward to playing it in the car with him! It's something mommy and daddy can enjoy too."
4,Johnny's album for kids,"I was looking for something for my 5 year old grandson as he suddenly decided he liked CW music. This album has several that he has attched to and has almost memorized. One song perhaps questionable as to being a childrens song but overall, great."
4,my little one loves it,i've played this album regularly for my little girl since she was a month old. it's been interesting to watch her progress from cooing at johnny cash's voice to bouncing and swaying with the music.
4,Johnny Cash children's album,We love this album! We can't get the songs out of our heads... It's not your typical kids' album - very refreshing.
5,Great Kids Album,"I am a big Johny Cash Fan so I bought this cd for my 13 month old son. Its a very cute cd and not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be kids singing Johny Cash songs, but its songs that he wrote for his kids and their friends. Great pick!"
2,Childrens album ?,"While I really like Johny cash & I bought 3 of these for my grandchildren based on the reviews, the inclusion of ""Tiger Whitehead"" & ""Old Shep"" was rather bizarre and ruined it as far a childrens album goes for me.The one talks about someone who kills 99 bears for their hides and keeping score to get to 100 bears slaughtered for their hides.The other one talks about the sadness of having to shoot a beloved pet.I don't consider either of those songs appropite for young children. Of course your value system may be different than mine."
4,Kid in Black,"What a strange album. For those wanting to help their youngsters learn early on to walk the line, this amalgam of song and spoken word is a strange but wonderful introduction to the Man in Black. Some songs, ""Nasty Dan"" and ""Tiger Whitehead"" for example, are simply swell -danceable for the very young and their buffoonish parents- other tracks drag, and the final monologue, which includes the line ""Russians are red,"" smacks of the absurdity that underlies the concept of a children's album by the man who ""shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die."" Cash fans, who know that many Cash albums come with one or two songs that will make them blush at the oddity of their message or delivery (Like ""Live at San Quentin?"" ...remember ""Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart""), will be willing to look past the drippy ""Little Magic Glasses"" and see the true warmth of songs like ""I Got A Boy And His Name Is John"" and the album as a whole. Others, stick to Raffi."
3,Cashed Out,"Some of the songs just seem too dark for a little one, like the one where the boy ends up shooting his dog. There are a couple good ones like One and One Make Two. We kept the ones that we thought were good and deleted the others from the IPod player. Overall, there are better kid CDs out there. Try some from Putumayo collection."
3,Diamond in the ROUGH,"If you are looking to learn to play the guitar through self-study, then BUY THIS BOOK - the whole series, for that matter. Your purchase will prove useful as the series contains good information and I believe his instructional method for guitar is quite sound and pragmatic. However, do not expect a polished product, by even the most minimal retail standard. Edwards may rate an A as a guitar instructor, but he gets an F as an editor/publisher. The otherwise good pedagogical content is poorly organized/presented, and heavily peppered with off-topic digressions (many of which express significant negativity). From an editing/publishing standpoint, it is *really* awful. You will work very hard to wade through the organizational problems and distractions contained in this text, but the fundamentally good content will reward your efforts in the end if you have the determination."
5,The most PRACTICAL and CONCISE instruction book yet!,I'd played a variety of styles for nearly 8 years and was relinquished to the 'brute force' memorization methods I'd been taught by instructors and books alike...until I picked up Fretboard Logic I upon a friend's recommendation. It should be the STANDARD INTRODUCTION TEXTBOOK FOR EVERY BEGINNING GUITARIST. But anyone who has not yet read this book may benefit from it.
3,Ehhh.,"Being a fan of the Vornado line of fans, I was pleased to get a working unit at such a decent price. Now that the initial glow has worn off, i feel as if my five star rating of the transaction was a bit to enthusiastic. The fan was described as being in used-very good condition, but was dirty upon arival and makes an annoying, struggling whine at lower settings. It is still a vornado and that makes up for these flaws."
1,How do you make a fan this bad?,"All it needed to do was blow air and not sound like an airplane engine.This is by far the loudest non-industrial fan I've ever heard. It sounds like some parts inside are misaligned. I'd return it under warranty, except that my friend has the exact same fan with the exact same problem, so it doesn't seem to be an isolated issue.Go buy a cheap fan from a hardware store. I can basically guarantee it will be better than this thing."
2,Lukewarm At Best,"If you've read the very fine ""The Last Kingdom"" and ""The Arthurian"" series, you already know what an exceptional writer Bernard Cornwell is.So what happened with ""The Archer's Tale"" series? Repetitious, meandering, and downright boring, with Thomas wandering aimlessly about the story. Such a one dimensional character! Bring back Uhtred! Bring back Dervel! Give us characters that jump off the page!Take it from me, if you've read ""The Last Kingdom"" and ""The Arthurian"" series, you will be bored."
4,Another Good Journey,"Story started a littel slower than most of Cornwell's novels, but really picked up the pace and I wasn't ready for it to end when the last pages came rolling along. Definitely need to read the Archer's Tale first. Vagabond does not stand on its' own like many of the Sharpe books do. However, it was another excellent read about the 100 years war from Cornwell. Can't wait for the next in the series to hit the streets."
3,"I like it, but I like everything and its really not that good.","This writing is just ok. We have a chance for a really good series but it just does not seem to come together. It seems like about half of each of these books could just be skipped since they have very little to do with the main plot. Thomas' travels are erratic and do not make sense, they seem to be there just so he can meet up with the villians that have become his enemies just because they are pricks. Also his waxing and waning interest and belief in the grail tend to get annoying. Robbie is an interesting stereotypical barbaric tag-along that really does get involved in the story. I guess I like the books because they take place in a setting that I find interesting but they really are not that good."
4,Vagabond,Excellent story combined with history that is accurate. The characters are real and developed with sympathy. The battles are bloody and the pictures of English archery fabulous.
4,Another solid novel by Cornwell,"If you are a fan of Mr. Cornwell, or historical fiction in general, you will love this book. It is the second in a trilogy so I would recommend reading the first book and I will definitely be moving on to the third book!"
4,Typically enjoyable Cornwell,"Typical Cornwell material; well researched with a winning lead character (always male & usually of the lower classes but in this case the bastard son of an errant priest nobleman) who faces adversity and overcomes it - credibly. Poor Thomas does tend to lose most of his female loves in this one, usually to the perfidious actions of a suitably motivated villain or two or to the hopes of a better fortune, but this is a book you can enjoyably devour in a few sittings.If you want to put a human face on the Hundred Years War period and the ever-shifting French, Norman, English alliances, the influence of The Church, and the aftermath of the battle of Crecy then this novel will entertainingly inform you. There is a third novel in the series too (entitled Heretic), also enjoyable: et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
3,Tepid Drama,Repetitious wordiness and a slow-moving story line detract from the interesting detail of the tumultuous events covered by this novel.
5,"Vagabond, Bernard Cornwell, book 2 of the grail quest","This was another awesome book from this author. I have read all three of the Grail Quest books, and found them next to impossible to put down until I had read them all. I am a great fan of history, and especially English history. I learned yet more of history in this read. And ordered more books from the same author. Will do so again too, his writing is fascinating."
4,Turns History Into Adventure,"Vagabond turns one of our least-studied periods of history into high adventure. Of course ""those people"" ""'way back then"" were real men and women with strengths and foibles. But it takes a gifted author to breathe the gift of realism into folks portrayed as living centuries ago. Bernard Cornwell has obviously done his research. This isn't really an historical novel, but rather a splendid novel set in an historical era."
5,Excellent camera,"I bought this camera while on a trip to St. Maarten. I have since used it while skiing, kayaking, hiking, swimming, etc. and have found it to take great pictures. Due to its construction and watertight casing, I don't have to worry about it being broken when getting wet or banged against something. The APS 3 picture size feature is great. Also, the accessories available make it much easier to carry and keep accessible.I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who is active, or just like to take great pictures easily."
2,Caveat emptor,"This camera has had a recurring problem wherein the ""replace battery"" icon flashes and the camera will not allow us to take any more photos - even after replacing the battery. This camera was purchased for vacation photos and three times now it has malfunctioned and needed repairs during the vacation, effectively making it useless. The zoom feature was previously repaired under warranty after minimal use. It took 3 months for Minolta to return the camera on that occasion. Our experience may or may not be rare, but it was bad enough to dissuade another purchase from Minolta."
4,Great Shots in all conditions,"This camera was great! I say was as I had it stolen just recently and am replacing it ASAP. Underwater fishing shots, snow or water skiing, snorkeling, name it, it does it. I several great sunrise panoramics that I took with this box... If I can't take the FE due to the conditions, the Vectis is the choice. Mid roll film changing is a problem as it isn't possible, and it's slightly bulky but as good as it gets otherwise."
1,underwater turnoff,"The on-off switch on my Minolta rusted, due to exposure to saltwater. The company said it was not defective...If you're buying this ... [as] an underwater camera...forget it!!! ...."
1,"For ""Still"" water ONLY","While this camera is advertised as being for all water sports - it is not to be used in ""moving"" water. The instruction manual includes the following: Do not rinse the camera under running water. Do not jump or dive into the water while holding the camera. Do not surf with the camera. I contacted the ""Help"" line to verify they were not saying ""no extreme sports"" and was told - in fact - this camera is for ""Still Water"" use. I was disappointed because this is NOT an all water sports camera as the writeup implies."
4,Way Too Quiet,"Actually, this nifty little camera deserves 5 stars. I give it 4 only because it is too darned quiet! I can't tell if I've made an exposure because it lacks the standard click of the shutter or the whirl of the film advancing I have become accustomed to. One other potential drawback for experienced APS users is that this camera is not capable of stopping mid-roll or re-loading partially exposed rolls of film. This is a feature I have come to depend on using other cameras (which are not water-proof) This little camera takes such great underwater photos it is a shame that Minolta decided to leave this feature out.Overall, it is really a cool little camera and worth every penny!"
1,Water Proof? I don't think so,"I have owned this camera about 2 years used it 3 times on canoe trips.it took great pictures! it got wet twice from splashing water. took it snorkeling once never went below 8 feet deep on a shallow reef with my 8 year old. the lens fogged up and would not work after that. Minolta can not fix it ""Water Damage"" buy a new camera. Ya right."
2,Only a peek at Bonnard,"This is a small book, limited in the scope of its scholarship and illustrations. The paintings chosen for the latter are pretty much standard to all books on the painter. In my opinion, there are much better works on Bonnard for those seriously interested in his work and life."
2,"No lumps, just dirt",I thought this would be funny for a gag gift at Christmas. There was no lump. It was just a tiny bit of coal gravel.
1,Not a Rug,This is not a rug at all. It's an outdoor mat for a porch or patio. It would be good for outdoors if thats what it was labelled. Warning! Buyer beware. It is for outdoors.The worst part of the whole affair is that the company that ships it didn't give me my full refund back. I am in dispute with them over 20% of the refund. I would never order anything from home decorators again.
1,damn hippies,"I dont like it when hippies start writing books bout things! and I dont like Hippies and also I dont like books, unless im throwing books at hippies."
1,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would.","I have been assigned to read this book for AP Government, but 25 pages through I have come to the conclusion that I will never finish it due to the incredible shortcomings of the text. My brief explanation of this book can be summed up in five words: Liberalist propaganda complete with cartoons. I think it best that I give all of you who are deciding whether or not to buy this book a little piece of the text. ""Tens of millions of [Americans] are addicted to alcohol, nicotine, or some other drug. Millions more are addicted to drugs such as amphetamines and barbiturates. The pushers are the doctors; the suppliers are the drug industry; the profits are stupendous."" There you have it, in all his glory, Michael Parenti. Buy this book and you can find much more just like this. I will read the remaining three hundred pages because I get at least one laugh out of every page."
1,Read this if You're Stupid and wish to be Vengefully Stupid,"Very Stupid. Usual left-wing trash pumped out by a guy with a major ""I hate America"" agenda. We had to read this guy at Gordon College in freshman political science class, circa 1977. Back then, he was applauding alleged superiorities of the Chinese health care system relative to the U.S. (not Taiwan, but the PRC). Once you enslave your mind to a Marxist class-based critique of society, and convince yourself ""business"" is demonic, this is what comes out of your pencil. But read it and be greatly impressed if you wish to waste your mental capacity on a retrogressive rehash of the frustrations of an outdated totalitarian worshipper who now, I seem to recall, subsists in a left wing think tank in Washinton, D.C. (always clinging to ""power"" centers) scribbling more trash."
2,"Nice chair, hard to get together","Chair came quick. But part of the bottom of the fabric ripped when putting it together. The screws were really hard to get in and took two of us to get them in. The blue paint chipped off as we were getting it together. Once it is together, it looks good."
1,The description of product is wrong,"The description of this item does not correspond with the product, if you order, you will receive a wrong item. I happened twice."
1,Another mis-listed product from Amazon marketplace,Look at the description and the pictures. Notice how they don't match. Both a subwoofer and an LCD are advertised here. At least they are getting closer. I thought I had ordered LCDs until subwoofers came in the mail. Back then there was only one tiny place in the listing that mentioned a speaker.I have no idea if the problem is from Amazon or from their marketplace vendors.
5,"worth the extra money, good quality","This bell was a little more expensive than others, but it is heavy duty, not plastic. Has a nice, loud ding. The ones sold for dog door bells are part plastic."
3,Scared my dog,"It's a great bell, the same as the ones you see in hotels, but it scared our dog. We got it to bell train our dog, so that he could let us know when he wanted to go outside instead of scratching at the door, but he ended up being so scared of the noise that the bell made that he would run away every time he heard it... The bell didn't work out for our purposes, but it's no fault of the product."
5,Krystal's review,"Postive lyrics, make this CD a winner. It brings me make to the days of BDP and Brand Nubians era where hip hop was taken from the street and enlightend to the fullest. Now that hip hop has reached a platoo, it only mentions materialics things which those lyrics are never remembered. This group parleys from this type of style because it eventually looses it finesse. Instead, Blindcyde keeps it real, simple and direct and this type of style could eventually put DJ's like Premiere out of work.....K"
4,Excellent training method with reduced use of force.,"Most methods of dog training rely heavly on the use offorce. This method is an excellent alternative.The techniques are simple and effective, but will require a lot of hands on work for the handler.This is not a twenty minute program that will have you walking with a perfectly trained pooch. Rather a life time of commitment by you and your buddy.Mike Boehm"
4,Le Havre,I thought that the movie gave a good view of people who live on the margins and the friendships that they establish between themselves.
3,French Social Structure,"Though this movie was highly touted by reviewers and friends, I found the experience to be a bit maudlin. The characters were involved with issues that seemed specific to such a small part of the population that I never developed even a passing concern for their outcome. Not my cup of tea but others liked it."
1,A Distortion of AA,"The author of this book is obsessed with linking AA's success to Christianity. Of course, this is a corruption of the very principles which AA adheres to. Stay away from this book."
2,Missing Tables,"I was very disappointed to find that the list of Crafting Schematics, actually even referenced in this manual, never made it into the manual. It was my primary reason for purchasing the book, and it was missing. No sign of it at Prima's Website as addenda either."
1,Useless Guide,This guide was useful when the game came out about 2 years ago. The game has changed so much. Its a completely different game now. Very little of the information is useful.
1,Only get this book if your studing Video Game HISTORY!!!,"A few months ago I just got SWG JLS along with the ""Official Game Guide"" from Prima and Its now useless because of the so-called CU or combat upgrade. I want a total refund from Sony for the Guide $19.99 the SWG $29.99 JTS $19.99 and my 60 day pre-paid Game Card 29.99. THIS is not the game I payed for.It's the only game I know were Healers are not allowed to heal.This Book Makes a great Paperweight"
2,Was good when game launched (perspective of a gamer),"This book was wrote when Star Wars Galaxies was in Beta still and even after Beta some things were changed. Profession's have changed such as the Bounty Hunter Profession as in terms of requisites. New items have been added (Especially in the terms of Chef) along with other new schematics (Speeders, Droids, Poison and Disease Resist Packs etc) and then there is the Jedi that are not even mentioned due to the fact that in Beta not one person unlocked the Jedi Profession and the fact the game's in a stage where a slew of revamps are about to be introduced.If you need a source that can be at your fingertips it may be better now to find a website instead of the book or seek advice from those that have previously tried that profession and made there way through the ranks. My recomendation for the beginner is to NOT buy this book due to the book being dated."
1,CU killed SWG,SOE ruined SWG with the CU and the subscription numbers don't lie. hopefully some other company will get the franchise in the future and won't make a total mess of it like SOE did.
1,Already out of Date,"MMPORPGs are dynamic worlds. As such, any ""guide"" is doomed to be obsolete. You best bet is to just bookmark some good SWG website for info. And, hey, they are free."
1,Beyond Terrible,"There is just nothing here, not even what you would normally expect from this type of guide. For example, you might expect to find out what a new skill gives you and the guide has this information, but not really. Image design skills give you new and different hair styles, tatoos, and the ability to customize your character in different ways. But what does each skill say? Exactly that without any specifics. Gee, that was helpful. Maybe I'd like to know which skill does hair and which one lets you work on someone's face and which one lets you change colors and spots. Nope. You might expect to find out what new clothes each level of tailoring gives you. Nope. You might expect to find out what different droid modules do. Nope.It has no detail, just generalities. Even the included manual is more helpful.I'm usually a defender of MMP Prime guides. This one doesn't even have the basic reference information. It is completely and utterly useless."
1,This book is worthless.,This book contains no useful information not already in the manual provided with the game.
4,Great if you are a new MMORPG player.,"This strategy guide doesn't give any more information than the instruction manual to the game. But it is ordered effectively and has helpful charts on weapons, professions, etc. When I started playing this game, it was my first MMORPG and I had no idea what I was doing. The instruction booklet to the game didn't help me figure it out. This strategy guide did, beginning with character creation and taking me through professions. And it offers extremely helpful tips on etiquette and how to communicate with other players online. If you are a veteran MMORPGer, then this book won't tell you anything you don't know. But if you are a rookie like me, it will get you on the fast track to success."
2,Didn't have the information I was looking for.,"Although this is a large book, it didn't have the type of information I wanted. It talks mostly how to pick a class, and master it. What I wanted to know was what made a resource good or bad, how to make better harvesters, and it didn't even touch that. This book doesn't really give detailed information of this type. If you just want to know how to climb the ladder to become master of a field, then this book will help. Also tells you what you will gain with each level advance. But, if you're looking for the type of information I am looking for, check out the internet instead."
2,I'm Good and this Release is Very Bad,"Unless I'm missing something, and I have a very good ear for music, this release drains fluids from the parakeet and then some. The one release I love is ""Times Squared"" and that's the one I'd recommend. But beauty is in the eye of the beholder and, yes, some people are just tone deaf."
4,Good for the lists...,"Be mindful, however, that the words in the book, because they are subject-related, are largely Tier 3 words and not Tier 2. I had to comb through each section to pluck out Tier-2 words and will probably have to get another book to help me with that."
3,great film - horrible ending,"Everything is right about this film until the ending. Barrymore is fantastic as is Conrad Veidt. Sets are immense and Barrymore's tragic scene when he removes is clown makeup, knowing he is exiled, is one of the two or three greatest acting scenes in film. And John proves himself a fine comedian in many scenes. But the ending---there is none!There is no conclusion, nothing but a tremendous build up to a confrontation that never occures. For me it destroys the film. But this, along with Svengali, contains probably Barrymore's two best roles."
2,"So much dexterity, not enough artistry ..............","So much ability, not enough judgement. There is no doubt Mark Whitfield at his best is as good as anyone. But he's not often at his best. He can write great tunes and play them to perfection (see ""Strollin'"" on this and ""LFO"" (long version) on G-Fire II), but not often enough.And what's with all the breathing noise on some tracks here? It completely destroys an otherwise fine version of ""What's New"".Is it intentional, or merely derelict production? There's a noise at 2:27 you just won't believe if you buy the mp3. Through headphones it sounds like he's got a life-threatening dose of the flu all the way through."
4,Fantastic but not Mark's best,"I am biased. It is hard for me to look at Whtifield's music and be disappointed. This project is heavy on instrumetnal guitar jams. Another effort in Whitfield distinguishing himself from themany others in this area. If you are debating betweenthis and others by Whitfiled, buy 7th Avenue Stroll."
1,Sissy Duck,"I find the word sissy to be a negative word. I have been a teacher for 15 years and do not feel that cooking, building sand castles and putting on puppet shows is anything sissy at all. Every child is unique and that is something to celebrate but not sissy. People that throw the word sissy around are wrong. It is name calling. He dedicates that book to all the proud sissies. Anyone that wears something totally wild anywhere is setting themselves up to be mocked. We all have common sense. Wake up people and recognize the gay agenda. My daughter brought this book home from Kindergarten and if you could see how the other ducks look at this little guy Elmer. They have extremely mean faces. Very unrealistic. Harvey is proud to be gay and that is fine but don't go pushing a gay agenda to my child under the cover of a cute duck book."
3,"maybe for older kids, not for 5 yr olds","I got this for my five-year-old because I thought it would be a sweet book celebrating people's differences via a metaphor about ducks, with the ""mean"" ducks being no meaner than, say, Rudolph's dad, coach, and Santa in the Rankin and Bass Rudolph special. But this book was just way too dark for me to read it to my little guy. The father duck in particular is just downright nasty to the ""sissy"" duck and there's a suggestion that the other ducks are actually going to beat up ""sissy"" duck on his way home from school. While I know this horror is true for a lot of real-life people, I just don't feel my 5 year old is ready to be exposed to such ugliness. This book is more for older kids who already have heard the ugly term ""sissy"" or are a little less innocent than a 5 year old who hasn't yet conceived of homophobic hatred. So, I'll keep looking for a gentler picture book that celebrates different-ness."
1,I guess I will go against the flow.,This is a lovely book with great pictures. I don't mind a book about being different but this one is clearly about more than that. It was not a message I was happy giving my four year old.
5,Wish I had this book when I was young,"I wish I had this book when I was growing up. I wish the people I had to deal with had this book, too. Maybe then I wouldn't have had to deal with such grief. I was a sissy, the biggest sissy at my school. I had no interest in sports (and threw a ball like a girl), enjoyed dressing up in my mother's clothes, and played with Barbie dolls. And, yes, when adolescence reared its ugly head, I realized that I was a homosexual.Concern that sissy boys will become homosexuals seems to be the main reason sissies are bullied, and told to be more masculine. But the fact is it doesn't work. People are people, and some of us are sissies, and some of the sissies, and some of the non-sissies, will grow to be homosexuals.This book acknowledges that people are different, and our differences are what makes a world. This book is must reading for sissies, as well as the parents and teachers who deal with them."

2,Band Won't Last,"The watch is nice and works fine, but the rubber band turned a dark brown within 3 months of purchase, had to buy a new leather band--- no reason to buy this watch"
4,Great Value!,"Although the piece is extremely lightweight, it appears well and solidly constructed, especially the hinge and closure. By comparison, another locket from Amazon itself at the same price point was small and tinny with a particularly poor hinge and closure. This one might be questionable as a gift since it feels a little unsubstantial, but great for my purposes."
4,Enjoyable,"We bought this for our three year old daughter and she enjoyed it. If your children like coloring and crafts, they will appreciate this gift."
3,"Less talk , more art please.","This was just okay. You can stream it for free in a lot of places. If you have no idea what BM is this will help. However if you just want to actually see the festival, the art, the people, there are probably better movies."
5,Read This Book!!!,"As a beginning Shotokan student, this book has been invaluable to me. It covers all the aspects of Shotokan from the body to the mind. It truly is the Master Text."
4,Fundamental part of your Martial Arts library,"Just commenting on the Kata reference portion. I think the walkthrough kata pictures are a bit sparse, but the text descriptions are very good. Personally, I prefer something like ""Best Karate"" for specific, take with you in the gym bag, reference materials for the kata. But this is a very good ""core"" book to keep on the shelf.In addition to the other topics in the book, the kata presented are:Taikyoku: Shodan, Nidan, SandanHeian: Shodan, Nidan, Sandan, Yodan, GodanBassai, KwankuTekki: Shodan, Nidan, SandanHangetsu, Jutte, Empi, Gankuku, JionTen no Kata (""Introductory kata to sparring"")(yes that's alata kata for one book)"
1,Karate teacher,Pure crap dont buy the book there are many more karate books out there that are much better if you like being lied to and fed candy buy this book you will really like it.
5,Focus is everything.,"The text in this book very enlightening. I recomend this book to all people, from the begginer to the most advanced pupil of the Art. Master Funakoshi expresses his ideas and methods very well."
5,Absolutely essential!,"I own a fairly good number of karate books, and this book is by far the most useful; it is unsurpassed as an aid for students wanting to refine their kata, and also offers good insight in the basic concepts of what karate-do is. This is not a book you can learn karate from (as if there were such a thing), but for those who already practice, this is a real must-read book. Funakoshi Sensei wrote this book as an aid for students of karate at the request of many of his own students; I believe he succeeded magnificently."
4,A return to simpler tunes,"It seemed as though the 1980s ran away with Gord. After a beautifully written/performed/produced ""Shadows"" was released, Lightfoot delved into other horizons. A tip of the hat must be given to someone who tries to expand themselves. The only problem was that 1983's ""Salute"" was too much of an over-the-top electric patchwork that didn't flow very well and 1986's ""East of Midnight"" was a jaw-dropping adult-contemporary nightmare.After having taken a break from the writing and producing for a spell, Gord returned in 1993 with what is possibly his best since ""Dream Street Rose"". ""Waiting For You"" has everything that made Lightfoot records of old so enjoyable. The songs are easy-going, listenable and singable. The music is instantly memorable and Terry Clements is up on his game on lead guitar, especially on the title track.Highlights include ""Restless"", ""I'll Prove My Love"", ""Waiting For You"" and ""Drink Yer Glasses Empty""."
5,My favorite and maybe the best Lightfoot,"My favorite used to be Endless Wire, which was 8 great songs with two snoozers that I found just too slow to keep me interested. This song has no filler. It's 10 great songs. I'm not sure that the 8 best here are better than the 8 best on EW, but maybe so. There is great variety and the Bob Dylan song is one of his best performances. His voice sounds a bit thin on the first two songs, and thinner on all than in the 70s & 80s, but you get used to that and the lyrics and melodies set this album apart."
3,"""Any Way The Wind May Blow""","'Waiting For You' released in '93 was Gordon Lightfoot's eighth and probably last collaboration with Reprise. Definitely Gordon's best days are behind him, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a nugget or two left to offer his adoring fans.Now late in his career we hear an aged, weathered balladeer who has just about experienced all there is to experience in this life. Older and hopefully much wiser Gordon presents his audience with -10 tracks- of musings about the road he has trod. His tunes are simple and uncomplicated. There are a number of weak tracks on this album/CD but a couple of very good ones as well. My particular favorites are 'Restless', 'Ring Them Bells' and 'I'll Prove My Love.'One thing you can always be certain of when it comes to Gordon Lightfoot, there's a message in each and every song. That's the mark of a true poet."
1,Is this some kind of joke?,"Who ever these dipsticks are it is just wrong for these people to appropriate the name of a group who made many fine albums, including one masterpiece which as far as I'm concerned is one the 20 best rock albums ever made, ""The Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardinicus"", to sell this drivel. The REAL Spirt obviously had nothing to do with this.Happy trails, John"
1,overlong and shallow,"This book is like a magazine article stretched to book length, with no increase in content. The writing is cloying and mawkish, mooning over ""mysteries"" any parent has seen 100 times, and understands better than the author..."
1,Single Mothers Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The differences between females and males was truly the best part of the book. After that I had several disappointments. As a single Mother I am looking for suggestions and guidance. This author states that no matter what we do as parents are children's lifestyles and habits are based on how their brains are formed!! How discouraging. There were also other references that go against my own personal and spirtual beliefs. My suggestion to other potential readers is to read this book from a different perspective. Do not read it as a guide as I did. Read it as another viewpoint out there about the incredible world of boys.
2,THE WONDER OF BOYS,"There were some very interesting facts in this book, but I bought it for my 21 year old granddaughter. She has a 2 1/2 and 3/13 year old boy. It was not very lay person friendly."
5,Great book!,"In the western culture people sometimes are so far off from the nature when it comes to raising kids in particular. This book (and some other good books on topic) is trying to accent the factors that shouldn't be ignored when raising boys. Boys and girls are very different in how they percieve the information, how they develop and how they are raised to be successful adults. Ignoring these facts is an ultimate road to nowhere."
4,"Must read, just keep perspective","A friend lent my husband and I this book. She has two boys as do we. She won't be getting the book back, I'm online now to buy her a new one. Very inciteful, particulary for me growing up with the theory, women and men can be the same in everything. The idea that through nurture we were teaching women a different role. This book changed my perspective.One negative:The book is preachy in regards to religion and male bonding groups. My husband decided to skip some of that. I read it, found it interesting, but like all books, I'm taking the parts that apply to my situation. The rest I'll leave out.A true must read if you have or care for boys."
5,The book is a valuable resource,"I'm shocked this book has gotten such bad reviews here. I've read it twice in my son's first year! I will probably read it again in a few years. I wish everyone who cares for or teaches boys would read this book. He tells about the differences between the male brain and the female brain. He stresses the importance of teaching boys spituality (not religion, just spirituality) and responsibility. There is a section in the book about how to talk to boys about sex and why it is so important. As a mother, I find this book to be very important and I've marked sections for my husband to read. Let's be realistic about the differences between boys and girls. While there are always exceptions, boys and girls do tend to be different in certain ways and this book is about how to raise and discipline a boy."
4,"Open your minds fellow proud feminists, PLEASE","Anyway, this book is oh so valuable. I have gotten SO MUCH out of it, including a greater understanding and respect for my husband and what his role in the life of our boys, our family, truly is. Wow. I msut admit, the chapter on mothers stinks. Gurian did an awful job on that, and is probably the main reason i couldn't give him a 5th star.And in response to soemone who thought only fathers liked this, as i said I'm a mother and i found this book tremendously valuable. Especially the part regarding the spiritual and mentoring needs of boys as they grow through adolesence. Gurian stresses the need for male mentors, and he has good points, but I personally imagine a boy needs any mentor with whom he clicks regardless of the gender of that individual.Anyway, this book is wonderful and thought provoking."
1,Pseudo-Feminist Alert,"Gurian claims in this book to be a ""feminist"" family therapist but reveals his anti-woman bias throughout the book, especially when he names the only ""feminist"" thinkers he agrees with: Katie Roiphe, Camille Paglia, and Christina Hoff Somers -- women who are more misogynist than feminist. Gurian's philosophy is truly dangerous. He states that men are biologically determined to be violent and dominant over women, and that women should not try to change this fact. He wildly understates the consequences of the ""boys will be boys"" attitude, such as sexual harassment and rape; and he seems bitter about the economic strides that women have gained in the past twenty years. This is a backlash book masquerading as a parenting guide."
1,Few people will accept all the unjustified opinions,This book contains mostly unsubstantiated biases of the author. It contains a philospohy rather than results of careful analysis. The philisophy is bizarre.This book will only appeal to a minority of gulible people who accept the authors opinions without substantiation.
2,Conservative or Christian Buyers Beware,"If you liked the women's rights movement, you'll love this. Michael Gurian starts with the idea that boys have been asked to be more like girls than men because of the victim/villian stereotypes of the women's rights movement. Unfortunately, he does not recommend a conservative correction to this injustice. What he recommends is a liberation of male culture. Teach boys that whatever you feel is OK, you just need to channel it in the right direction. For instance, Guirian hails masturbation as a proper channel for sexual urge. Gurian also favors the biological basis of homosexuality, explaining that there is a genetic tendancy toward being homosexual. He believes that we should just accept the facts if our sons ""are"" homosexual. This makes as much sense as allowing them to drink alcohol because, as we all know, there is a genetic tendancy toward being an alcoholic. Buyer beware, this is not a conservative or Christian approach to raising our sons."
2,Would Never Recomend,"This book was highly recomemnded to me, Yuck. I read 20 pages and hoping it would get better, it never did."
2,"boys need punishment??? WHAT?! and rarely, a spanking???","At first, I thought that Gurian had some very helpful/insightful things to say about what boys need....THEN, he goes on to say that boys need rules, and consequences, and punishments... he suggests how to punish a boy.... and then even goes on to write about SPANKING! saying that it should be very rarely done, and then quotes John Rosemond's guidelines for spanking !!!!After reading Raising Cain, I was definitely expecting more from Gurian than punishment....I can see how the other reviewers would say that they think his poor relationship with his mother (as he describes it) made an impact on the writing of this book."
1,What a dissapointment,"I was so dissapointed! After having a son, I was looking forwards to reading this book and stupidly bought it. At first I thought some of the ideas were interesting and was very upset to read that boys are more suseptible to child abuse. Then I read two whole pages on how to spank a child!! North America has the highest rate of child abuse as the North American law allows spanking..other countries..like Scandanavian countries do not allow any kind of physical punishment of children and have a much lower incidence of child abuse.Shame on this author! I can't believe someone would write a book outlining how to spank a child!!! As a parent, I read precisely to have many other options than resorting to that..I was going to give the book away, and then decided to just throw it away..I wouldn't want to pass this onto someone else!"
2,"Interesting, but get ""Real Boys"" by Pollack instead.","As a parent of 3 boys, a grandparent of 2 boys, and a classroom teacher of boys for 34 years, I found this book to be interesting, but not as insightful as I would have hoped. There were just a few too many generalizations. I found ""Real Boys"" by William Pollack to be more in depth aboutwhat really makes boys tick (aside from testosterone)"
3,Interesting and thought-provoking; some kernels of wisdom.,"I found the Wonder of Boys to be a mixed bag. I finished feeling I learned a lot about my husband and my 17-month old son but some of the author's theories seemed ""over the top"". In several places throughout the book, I had to suspend judgment to see what I might learn. I found there were kernels of wisdom mixed within a strong-willed and peculiar view of boys and their place in the world."
2,okay coat,Great price but coat did not arrive as pictured: no faux fur trim at the bottom and cloth side looks a little unfinished as result (as if cloth side was just cut a litle too long). I kept it only because I desperately needed something warm the day it arrived. Faux fur very soft but sheds a little.
4,"Utex Women's Fun Fur Reversible Coat, Brown, Medium",The coat is nice and very warm. The only problem that I have with it is that the sleeves are too short and when unbuttoning it sometimes the buttons get twisted.
3,Description of item is mis-represented,"The description of this item indicates that there will be more than one baffle. Generally, you would think they would come in pairs. However, I got only one baffle and now it looks like I will have to pay full shipping again to get the other baffle for my dyna.Also note that although it comes with the attaching nut and bolt, there is no hole drilled into the baffle to use to secure inside the pipe. Be prepared to drill your own hole in some pretty hard metal.If only I had known to order two. The price was not prohibitive."
4,teeny-weeny cute as pie,"purchased long ago-when released, for $12.99, and was pleased. Used as prop in 1/6 diorama BUT would NEVER pay this out of line price! If a toy this price is outrageous, if collecting it is still out-of-line!!! Come on people-use your common sense, be reasonable! This is made of plastic, just another mass produced item. We can be a consumer society but no need to be INSANE. I thought the price I paid was PLENTY."
5,Loved this book!,"I used to own this book back in college and then lost it. I was so thrilled to find it again. It was a great as I remembered! Freddy is darker and creepier. ""Miles to Go Before I Sleep"" and ""Asleep at the Wheel"" were my favorites."
5,A tribute to a legend,"Clint Eastwood is one of the few actors who can direct, produce and compose the music for his films. Many actors who try to do this fall flat on their face. However, Eastwood has proven himself time and time again through extraordinary films like ""Unforgiven"", Million Dollar Baby"", ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and ""Gran Torino.""""The Eastwood Factor"" is a documentary about Clint Eastwood's film career. While this documentary does not speak to Eastwood's personal life, it does a great job of describing Eastwood's notable films. The documentary also includes Eastwood himself speaking on what inspired him to make each film. Most appropriately Morgan Freeman who has co-stared in numerous Eastwood films narrates the documentary.If you interested in documentaries or Clint Eastwood himself, you will find this documentary to be quiet interesting and entertaining."
3,Grab Bag,"My favourite song on this cd is Sash!'s ""Just Around the Hill"" feat. Tina Cousins. On this Cd, you have a touch of American pop as well as Europop and Eurodance. The songs range from differnt genres, but all popular in the UK. I really couldn't stand Daphne and Celeste's ""Ugly"" becuase it's a cheer that they sang. It's very chipmunky voiced and not worth the torture. There are a lot of songs to choose from, so even if you don't like some of them, you may surprise yourself and find others that you do."
5,The best human resurrection novel I've read,"I've read Stephen King's PET SEMATARY and Richard Laymon's RESURRECTION DREAMS, and loved them both, but Daniel Gower's THE ORPHEUS PROCESS is my favorite read on the topic of bringing the dead back to life. The horror, the sci/fi, the deep emotional involvement, make this the one I'd take to my desert island library."
1,another borefest,"This is the second dud in a row that I've read. I hate when that happens. I got a little over 100 pages into this story and there were STILL NO ZOMBIES! I'm sure they showed up after awhile and I'm sure it was cool, but I'm not sticking around to find out. Who writes a zombie story and doesn't put the zombies in the story for so long! It goes on and on about the main characters home life and his work in the lab. After awhile you just don't care anymore. If you like looooong character development then go right ahead and read this. If your looking for a fun zombie story like I was? Stay away."
2,"Lotta potential, but....","Gross, disappointing, cliched... Daniel Gower's THE ORPHEUS PROCESS is 1 of the weakest horror novels I've ever finished (the other is Mary Hanner's RAPID GROWTH, also part of Dell's Abyss horror line, home of the brilliant Kathe Koja), but I DID finish it.... The main character is a doctor/researcher who tries 2 bring his murdered daughter back 2 life -- but B4 that happens U'll B fed up with the cliches, the Frankenstein's-laboratory-style reanimating equipment, the stupid story developments. Sorry, not even the obvious gross-outs woke me up...."
1,did not work,it did not work like other reviewer say that .try to watch a moivie from pc and two different tv different room to watch netflix streaming
2,didn't work for me,"With all the warnings from previous users, I still decided to try it out. Needless to say, it didn't work for me. I do have the dual-link dvi card mentioned by another review, but still it didn't work. I don't think it is the quality of the cable or connectors since it looks nicely constructed. The computer simply refuse to display anything when I have it plug in two both monitors. I would advise against trying this unless you are desperate. Even if you can return it, it will likely still end up being a waste of time."
1,Not what I expected,I purchased this product to enable dual monitor capabilities on my desktop computer. Product description was a little misleading as this cable does not perform this function.Beware cables unlimited does not offer technical support over the phone. I emailed them about the product and received no response.Wish I could return this but its past 30 days.
1,Bad product,"I used to connect my laptop and DVD to my projection TV. But the quality from the laptop to TV was a very bad.When I connect the laptop direct to TV was perfect, so definitely the problem was the cable"
1,Misleading product,"Do not buy this product believing it will allow you to send the signal from your computer to two screens, or to a TV. This product will not work without buying an expensive booster. Amazon stood by their return policy so this venture didnt cost me anything except some time."
2,Didn't work out,"I was trying to split a single digital signal into two for multiple monitor use. Regardless of the fact that the description did not tell you that you need to have a dual-link DVI output on your computer, I was still savvy enough to check for that. My video card does in fact have dual link output, but this particular splitter still did not do the job. It only splits the same video output onto two monitors. Something I have no idea what people could possibly use it for. At least it was cheap."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"It splits the signal as it's designed to, you can't complain there. You need your devices to be able to use it though, which can be an issue."
1,It Does Not Work,I join the majority of the reviewers who stated that this product does not work. I tried it. The cable is also very thick and not flexible.
2,Not that simple.,"Splitting a video signal is not that simple, your computers video card must support multiple displays (and if it does it prabobly alredy has 2 or more connections). if your video card does not support multiple displays this connector will definitlly not work. I found out the hard way."
1,Not compatible with mac...I think,"I tried to split one of my display outputs so that I could use both my LCD monitor and my television. They both work individually, but when I hook them up to the splitter, neither of them work at all! Very dissapointing. I may have a defective product, but we'll see once I exchange it."
1,Stopped working after one day,"The splitter worked ok when connected initially.However, after unplugging it twice, it failed. One of the pins came loose. Returned item for refund"
1,omne or the other monitors gets detected by pc and only one works tried oredering another one does same thing,junkomne or the other monitors gets detected by pc and only one works tried oredering another one does same thing
3,It could have been played better.,It could have been play better. Ricci has a very diferent wayof playing. What I mean is that when he plays he has bad bowing andthat makes the song messy. It could of had more gusto. You half to here Perlman play that song and you will know what I mean.
1,"Puerile, stupid and annoying","I bought this book as a complete novice, hoping to get started with programming. However, with its total abscence of excercises I found it boring and pointless. There was nothing to test or engage any sort of real understanding of the topics covered."
1,wrong show,"I cannot review this dvd because they sent me the wrong one twice. This is not Charles Starrett or Frontier Fury. It is the Lone Rider in Frontier Fury with Fuzzy Al St. John. Wrong actors and wrong title. I reported this mistake and I hope they resolve it so I can buy it. Your old western pal, Kevin Boyd"
1,frontier fury=INCOMPETENCY OR DISHONESTY?,"BAD BAD BAD !!!!I VE BOUGHT FRONTIER FURY,WITH CHARLES STARRETT AND RECEIVED A BAD BAD BAD COPY OF THE THE SAMETITLE WITH GEORGE HOUSTON.SHAME !INCOMPETENCY OR DISHONESTY?OR BOTH AT THE SAME TIME?I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
4,Great efforts which should really be appreciated!,"Being a dinosaur collector, I found this book interesting and quite comprehensive. Full of pictures and good quality printing! Though there are still rooms for improvement. For example, the list of the Carnegie collection is not complete, neither is that of the Jurassic Park series. The prices contained for some of the items are not realistic, too. Despite the above, I still love this book very much. Thank you!"
2,Another garden variety financial book,"I saw this in the library today and spent about 2hrs reading it. To be fair, the book gave some basic advice on saving money and invest it for the future. Unfortunately, it's just like 99% of the so-called financial advice books out there -- telling stuff most people already know."
1,Nothing New,"One way to start yourself on the road to financial independence is to save the money you would spend on this book and just read some advertising from any mutual fund provider. Halfway through the book, the author lets us in on how he made his money. Not made from his sound investments, but from direct marketing of pamphlets providing ""investment advice"". The kind of ""get rich quick"" scheme you find in the back of second rate magazines. When I hit that piece of information, I threw the book out. I couldn't even sell it second hand with good conscience."
3,a pretty Good set,this is easily the Best Smokey Robinson Album in how I don't know how long.He is One of the Greatest songwriters&vocalists the World has Ever heard Period.the material here is uplifting&truly captures where Smokey is in His life these days.
4,Smokey's best songwriting since the early days!!,"Smokey is known for his quick wit and metaphorical spunk and this, his first Gospel album, is his best songwriting since the early days. One can hear traces of the call and response style we've come to know and love. For someone who has been in recording studios and on stage since the late 50's, Smokey's voice has remained pure and smooth. The stand out tracks are ""Jesus Told Me To Love You"" and ""We Are The Warriors"". These songs are not Smokey's first Gospel recordings; The Miracles released two great Christmas albums during the sixties, and their recording of ""Rock of Ages"" on ""In Loving Memory"" is astounding. ""Food For The Spirit"" is full of some of the best current music around and is sure to raise the standard for other contemporary artists."
5,ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST,I love everything MOTOWN old school have always loved smokey's sexy soul how ever if you want SOME GREAT GOSPEL this is it try it you'll NEVER see MOTOWN & GOSPEL THE SAME it is what it's title says'
2,The opposite of good is meant to be good!,"Yes, this man is a gentle giant when it comes to transferring the human emotion, the soul and the spirit into music. No, his taste in music production hasn't developed in 20+ years. It still sounds like sappy mid 80s computer pre set inferno. If you want classic and not zeitgeist-y sounds then go and use a real band for starters, please, will you, Smokey!? And if you want the modern 2004 sound call Raphael Saadiq, or the Roots. They'll be delighted to fix you up with that organic, yet modern sound you need so despereately, believe me, you do. Sorry."
1,Awful - Smokey what was you thinking?,"This has to be one of the worst CD's I have ever heard. I love good spiritual music but this CD lacks continuity. I don't even know what category to put it in. It is not gospel, not contemporary Christian, just a bunch of hodge podge. I don't know what Smokey was thinking. I eventually gave the CD to one of his biggest fans and she didn't like it. Pray about it long Smokey before you make another spiritual CD like this one. This was a disaster."
2,Cool but not what I'm looking 4,"I definitely need 2 save my money on this one 'cuz I haven't give it much thought. I know it's hard to try it out and give a short listen. I think he needs to work hard next time in order 4 him to deepen more into his singing a lil bit while singing gospel. Believe me I'm still a long-time Smokey Robinson fan and never thought he had a gospel album out until day 1. Keep it up, Smokey. Look forward 4 the next album 2 drop out."
4,For the money...Killer,"I got this lens for my daughter. I shoot Leica. We went to Mexico together, did lots of the tourist photos. When we got home we had a one hour lab print 5X7s. For sharpness and contrast it was a near match to the Leica. I can't think of a better endorsement for a lens under $100.00. Sure the zoom range is limited and it is a bit slow. but the build quality is good and it make fine images."
5,the COOLEST gift for young readers!,"I enjoy comics, and this one is high quality, literate, and under the Gorey-like macabre world of the Little Vampire, is a very tender and funny story about friendship. But I didn't immediately realize just HOW popular this book can be with the young crowd.I first read it to a six year old niece of mine who was -- literally -- howling with laughter half the time!Then I gave it to my neighbor's 9 year old son for his birthday -- and he has already lent it to all his friends. i've given three others to 10 and 12 year olds, and they go berserk over it. So if you feel like making yourself popular and cool with the young ones, this book is the ticket.It also deals with difficult emotions like grief and loneliness, but stays playful and goofy at the same time. And the dialog is really intelligent. So yes FIVE STARS for the (adorable) Little Vampire."
4,Dreamy & Lovely,"Belly's Star is the perfect early '90's alternative album in my mind. Tanya Donnelly's breathy, little-girl voice twists and giggles through all these wonderful yet brief songs, but the buzzing instrumentation keeps the album from being too poppy. She is absolutely fantastic, and I wonder if she is still performing.All of the songs are great, but at times sound a bit repetitive, as they have similar themes and sounds. Yet all in all, the entire album wraps you up in its mood and takes you somewhere else, to a strange land that is hard to leave. ""Full Moon, Empty Heart"" is easily my favorite, with its combination of melodic and tense vocal styles, with the bouncy ""Gepetto"" at a close second. But all the songs are a nice listen on a rainy day afternoon."
5,great first album,"white belly is my fav song on this album! although i find both star and king to be ausome, king has a raw new wave appeal with songs like red and seal my fate. but star rocks nonetheless!! it's very belly."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Tonya Donnelly is probably the most boring, bland, blah altera-chick ever. I'm still trying to figure out why everyone loved this album. Feed the Tree and SlowDog were cute, but they got old quicker than Tiffany in a scrunchy-outlet. Belly lacks the ferocity of the Throwing Muses and the pop innovation of the Breeders. Belly is alt-rock that's moved to the suburbs."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I bought this album on the strength of Feed The Tree and Gepetto, both awesome songs, but was disappointed to find there isn't a single other song on the album that is even half as good. I know, they're obvious favorites because they're the singles, but in this instance they really were well chosen. A lot of the other songs have an odd off-key quasi-classical style. I'm not sure what it was the band were trying to achieve, but unless it was experimentalism for it's own sake, I don't think they were successful. As far as 90s alternative chick-rock goes, you could do far worse than this album, but it's hard to see the rest of the album as anything but inexplicably wasted potential after hearing Feed The Tree and Gepetto."
4,Among the top 20 CDs of the nineties ...,"This is one the few CDs from the nineties I have in my collection. It kinda has an 80's ""indie"" quality to it (when alternative used to be actually experimental and creative) - ethereal and haunting, yet artsy and quirky as well. I also think Tanya's vocals, while not as powerful or wide-ranging as a Sinaed O'Connor, are simply beautiful for this music."
5,Great album!,This is one good alternative-rock album. Tanya Donelly's vocala are great and the songs are very smart and catchy. I would highly recommend this album!
4,Love the mood.,"Belly sets up a mood with this album that is sustained throughout each song. The album's a little melancholy and sullen, moody and thoughtful. The music is sort of like what Fiona Apple's dreams must sound like. I've had the album for years and will never part with it."
4,solid alterna-pop,"I was once mocked for liking this band in the 90s because apparently they weren't 'real' enough. Bah. They're totally catchy, and I like Tanya Donelly's voice much better than Kristen Hersh, who tends to sound like she's being strangled. I can't really handle a bad vocalist. This also has pretty good lyrics; it's great summer music; great driving music. Don't be afraid of liking ""pretty"" music. ""keeping it real"" is 90's b.s."
4,Good Early 90's alt album,"This is a good alt. album. Belly had one small radio hit back in the early 90's with Feed The Trees. that song never gets old. Other songs on this album have to grow on you, but after listening to them, you really get to like it."
4,overall good product,is a bit on the small side but my sony a200 and all acc. do fit as well as my dell inspiron 1520 but everthing fits tight. Is a good buy for a carry on as it is small.is well padded and seems to be good protection for my stuff but would hate to have to get cammera out or put it away in a hurry.would have gotten five stars if the camera compartment was slightly bigger.
2,Upgrade if you have a SLR,"The top pocket for the camera is outfitted with a suspended base to protect the camera from shocks. However even as my Pentax K100D camera is listed in the camera matrix spreadsheet (available on CaseLogic's website) for this backpack, it will only fit, if I remove the lens, which is not really practical. Alternatively, remove the suspended base, lay the camera on it's back and loose the benefit of the shock protection.The straps on the side of the bag is to short to hold on to a tripod, which makes me wonder what they are there for. I tied on bungee chords to hold on the tripod.Construction and build appears good. Fit for the lenses are tight but workable. If you have a lot of extra gear like cables, filters, etc. you will likely end up using one or more lens places to hold that.I have a CaseLogic shoulder bag SLRC-2 which works great, but should I make the selection of a backpack again, I would likely go for a larger model."
4,Not too spacious but quite convenient to use camera backpack,"A little tight on space for the camera body (my Rebel EOS camera did not fit until the objective has been removed), but with plenty of space for objectives and other gear. Cudos for easily accesible pockets and very smoothly working zippers. Aha, the price of about $60 is unbeatable..."
4,Just what I needed,"I had received the Nikon D40X DSLR along with the 18-55mm kit lens and the 55-200mm lens for my birthday. I've also purchased a camcorder and I already have a Dell Inspiron 6000 (15.4 inch) laptop and a Canon S50 point and shoot. All of these things plus chargers, cables, extra mini dvds, mouse, accessories fit perfectly into this small backpack. The fit is snug, but that's how it's supposed to be. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase, although I just found it for $32 on cyber Monday here at Amazon. 4 stars only because I've only had it for 2 months and I don't know how it's going to hold up in the long run. It looks and feels like it's a quality product."
3,Great value for the money but too small,"I paid aprox. 175$ for this bag which I must say i pretty cheap for a bag like this. Quality is also quite good.But fitting a 15"" laptop in it is VERY difficult and i bet with some laptops impossible....the zippes becomes VERY tight. I use it with a 10"" MSI Wind and still it's tight.It does hold an SLR camera but adding a batterygrip on digital rebel makes the camera space VERY tight also.Top rating for price and quality.....but the space in it is a drawback."
4,Great size and customization,"I looked at a lot of bags that could hold my 13"" tablet PC and my Sony Alpha at the same time for travel. Most were way to huge/expensive for my tastes.The fit up top for the camera itself is a little tight like others said but the camera does indeed fit OK. And you can adjust the ""floor"" of the top compartment down some to fit slightly longer lenses than my kit lens.Lots of customization for the lenses and compartments. They are all held in place by Velcro so they can be moved to taste. Nice.I also like that the bag stands on end whenever set down.The Bad: Build quality of the zippers is marginal. One of the rubber zipper pulls tore of completely the first day. Easy enough to add another loop to replace the pull but annoying. Zipper action not too smooth when the bag is loaded."
1,Limited coverage of the Caribbean,"WARNING: If you are planning a trip to Cosumel or Playa Del Carmen-in the Caribbean, you will NOT find any information about these places in this book. Someone should sue Fodor's for calling the book: ""Fodor's Caribbean"", since it does not encompass the entire Caribbean! I am very disappointed and plan to return the book."
4,INTERESTING,I don't know anything about this title but found it very easy to understand and can use it!Thanks
4,Portable Ice Maker,"Only problem I had was knowing if it was running or not, light comes on, then off, then... nothing for a long time. But it did finally start making ice. Now that I know how it operates I'm quite happy with it. Thebigger cubes take a lot longer to produce than expected, if you want ice in 10 minutes, start with the smallest cube size. However I'd recommend the product overall. Draining the water is a bit of a nuisance but at least the port doesn't leak."
5,"Djur, May the GD of your choosing Bless You.","Who has ears, USE THEM.Amalia Rodriguez->Cesaria Evora->Chava Alberstein->Merita Haliliand... Her.Well. From this CD I only bless 1, 4, 5. If you want to be mystified further and are tonaly adventurous, find this and listen: Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares.Pay especial attention to word Mystere. Yes it means the same thing in French as in English.Anything from Cesaria. From Merita... She is Albanian, is very hard to find her best recordings, but who finds it is for a great surprise.Chava? Yiddish Songs. Unglaublich!!!You are almost done with World Music Quins.Here is one, that even though has only One Great CD, but she is in the same league.Souad Massi!If you would like to experience her Magic/Magick, listen to DEB, and ONLY to DEB.Continue the journeyGood luck and good night..."
3,Uneven,This disk would be tremendously improved by chopping it down to the three good tracks. The rest should go out with the bath water.
5,Best book on network based markets,"I came across this book because I was searching for relevant expertise to help me with real-world decisions. I have helped launched B2B and B2C products for networked-based businesses including amazon, realnetworks, and t-mobile. I've also consulted on network-based business models and products to make go/no go investment decisions.From the perspective of an investor, a busines unit owner, or a product manager this is the best book there is for understanding and succeeding in network-based markets. This book is a fantastic resource."
3,"Nice quality, good looks... a tad short on protection.","Well made case for Palm V, but a bit short on design forethought as it does not protect the PDA sufficiently as to prevent the buttons from being activated through the cover, therefore allowing for the device to continually power on and off, significantly reducing battery life between charges. Good looks, short on practicality."
4,Masterson Method,"Good preview to work, helpful resource adjunct to the book. Book & video are great together. Makes you want to take his training."
5,must have,"My show mule has been lame from a pinched scapular nerve, off and on for about 5 yrs. His current chiro retired and the last one did more harm than good. I live in an area that there aren't any chiro's to choose from for about 300miles. I ordered this as an attempt before hauling to denver 5 hrs away.I can honestly say, wow. I did everything he suggested, wrote notes and used them off the video and my mule is completely sound. It was his neck as usual, and everything he offered for treatment was spot on.He did a great job showing the angles he's working at, the horses reactions and releases and how he handled the situations. I owe alot to this guy for what he did to help me with my mule because it would of been a 5hr one way drive next weekend had this not worked.This is well worth the money and something you want to keep, and take notes with you to the barn when you go."
4,They Tore Out My Heart and Stomped That Sucker Flat,I already knew the subject and content of the book and simply wanted another copy of it.The book arrived quickly and in very excellent condition.
3,It's okay,"The book I received was great and in good condition, however, I ordered 2 of them and did not get the other one. I only received one. I think whoever reviews the orders should do a better job, I payed for shipping on 2 books and only got one."
1,Heartless,"The most attempted book on my shelf. I've many books on Buddhism, but none that I've begun more times without finishing. This book is stillborn. Dead. I've read car repair manuals with more feeling. I absolutely hate to throw books out, but this one I finally managed."
4,"So real, So painful","Mixed blood Ojibwe writer Drew Hayden Taylor touches the heart with this two act play which relates the pain and grief resulting from government programs in which Indian children were virtually stolen from their parents to be adopted by non-natives.The plot revolves around the newly found relationship of long-separated sisters who have been reunited; one from the reservation and the other an urban raised attorney. A short play of pathos and humor, the characters are very alive and will remain in the reader's memoryThis reader found herself hoping to have an opportunity to see the play performed someday."
1,too small,Call me crazy but I believe this hat is for women. Luckily my wife is a Cowboy fan but it certainly doesn't fit me.
5,great product,The Cowboy fan was very pleased with the hat. It wasn't overdone and it was easy to adjust for his head size.
2,it'll do,"The mask isn't all that great quality, the chain doesn't seem as long as in the picture. It'll do."
4,"GREAT for preteens,girls with sensitive skin,and scientists","****My mom bought this for 10-year-old Amanda, who has eczema, and has to be careful what she puts on her skin.~ - ~ - ~For other pre teens who need to be careful of skin, - this is great! You know what the ingredients are, as you make the concoctions yourself. Now all can join the herbal and scented shampoo/body potion craze.****Directions are easy to follow, but be prepared for a little searching for a couple ingredients (we initially had trouble finding sea salt which was used in one of the best recipes)Great recipes included milk bath for dry skin, and salt skin scrubs (seriously-feels great!) for mild exfoliating and skin softening.Pre-teens and teens can follow recipe instructions fairly easily, but may need help shopping for a couple of the more hard to find ingredients. (Natural beauty supply stores and the Internet helped)****Lots of good, *clean*, healthy fun, attractive to young teen girls"
4,Great books!,Bought two of these books as gifts for Christmas for neices (ages 13 & 14). Great book! Wish I'd had this at their age!
2,Okay place to start if you are just getting into foxpro,"Just to keep it short and simple, if you are even slightly familiar with Foxpro this is not the book for you. Whereas if you are just beginning to learn an xbase langauge, this book will give you a great overview of most topics."
4,Helped me get my feet wet.,This book helped introduce me to VFP 6.0 even though it was written for VFP 5.0. Very elementary and good for the beginner.
2,not professional,"I purchased this DVD based off the positive reviews. This DVD was a bit odd. It is very cheaply made, the music is jazzy which does not seem to fit with baby massage and the joy segment is almost exactly the same as the peace segment just a little different music. It is not enjoying to watch. I gave it two stars because I did learn some good information. Once I have mastered the massage moves I will not longer use the DVD because it is really annoying. I wish I had purchased baby TaTa insead, it looks more professional."
3,The perfect companion to a romantic evening.,"The CD is wonderful. There are songs here that can be played over and over again, without exhaustion. But the design really doesn't mirror the movie, so it stands on its own. That might be a bad thing, because the movie was a good one, and had lots of tempo changes. This CD does not, it pretty much stays in one or two gears, as far as too little of the songs being upbeat."
4,just like I thought,Just like I thought it would be. Some of the songs I did not remember from the movie even tho' I have watched the movie dozens of times. One of my favorite.
4,A very eclectic group of artists.,This is a soundtrack from a movie that appeals to a broad base of the public and the producers picked artists that will appeal to many. I have two twenty-year-olds that recommened the cd to me after seeing the movie. In all the soundtrack is great.
4,notting hill soundtrack,"If you want really beautiful music to have a glass of red with ,this is one you will enjoy"
1,Only bought this for one song on the cd....,"I don't know why Elvis Costello's ""She"" isn't available on iTunes. I had to buy this awful cd just to be able to download ""She"" onto my iPod. it's a ""throwaway"" cd."
5,A Great Soundtrack,"i think that this is such a wonderful soundtrack. i really loved the movie as well. the tracks ""she"" and ""when you say nothing at all"" are my favorites!!! this is a great cd to add to a souundtrack collection or any collection! it's great!"
4,excellent music for everyone,"This soundtrack has so many beautiful songs. ""youve got a way with me"", ""When you say nothing at all"", are just to name a couple. My mom loves this soundtrack, my brother, and my boyfriend does also, so that tells you that this is for everyone."
4,very well put together,"I was sure in the movie Faith Hill singing First Kiss was heard, yet I don't see it on the sountrack, apart from that I liked the soundtrack alot :)"
4,uh huh...it's a nice one...,In the originally i thought the movie is okay so i decided to watch it later.But after i listened the CD i just can't wait to see the movie .
5,The Bomb!!!!!!!!!,This soundtrack was absolutely wonderful.. It made the move so natural and relazing. I enjoyed terribly.
2,too cheesy!,"I really, really liked the movie ""Notting Hill"", but the soundtrack already annoyed me in the movie theatre, becuase I thought it was just too cheesy. That's really the only word that comes to mind. I do like romantic music and there is some really classy stuff out there (I HIGHLY recommend the ""When Harry met Sally"" soundtrack), but this one just overdoes it. The movie has such great moments that speak for themselves, the music just comes across as much too heavy-hitting."
2,"Okay, but not that great over all.","I own this cd and there's really only one good song on this entire album, and it's ""No Matter What,"" sung by Boyzone. Boyzone is the only really gifted singing group (or person) on this album, and the reason for that is because the person who discovered them was Andrew Lloyd Webber. (Andrew Lloyd Webber also wrote ""No Matter What,"" by the way, for his musical ""Whistle Down the Wind,"".) It was a real let down that the rest of the songs on this album were not as good as the first song. Fortunately, that first song was WONDERFUL! --Green Knicht"
2,"Ugh, can you say 'awful'?","And I thought the movie was pretty crummy! The soundtrack has only a few good tracks and the rest is complete mush! Don't get me wrong, I like love songs. But Boyzone? Shania Twain singing yet another one? 98 Degrees? We've gone too far! The only songs I could like were 'She' by Elvis Costello and the song by Al Green! Not to mention all those bonus tracks, topping this peice of cheese with a little stupidity. Don't get this album, unless you liked the movie!"
5,PERFECTION,"This soundtrack is the perfect example of the movie itself, simply worth seeing, and this CD is simply worth buying!"
1,Gruesome dirges vie with classic trax,I have to give this a kicking because of that horrendous dirge they insist on plastering over the music sequences. Yeuugh. Even the genius Bill Withers can't sweeten this little pill.
1,Missing Songs,"Where is the incredible Pulp song that was in the movie? I don't appreciate incomplete soundtracks, especially when some of the best songs are left off in exchange for mediocre songs by more popular artists..."
1,Another Regular Soundtrack for Another Romantic Comedy,"The movie was another typical romantic comedy that had 10 times more boring romance than comedy and was very formulaic. Now you can also have the formulaic soundtrack. The trick to all these bad formulaic soundtracks is to get all the love or rap songs (love songs in this case) that weren't in the movie you can, and put the movie's label on it. The songs, in this case, are not that good either."
2,The movie is cute---not the CD,"I love Julie Roberts' dreadfuly romantic movies and have a bunch of their soundtracks. If you are looking for one to relive the movie with, check out Runaway Bride or my personal favorite, My Best Friends Wedding. This however, has a good song, and then it's over."
5,Buy it !!,This soundtrack is really one of the better ones I've heard. Many great songs....especially the one by Elvis Costello. Definitely recommended !
5,AMAZING!,"The Notting Hill sound track totally compliments an amzing film. I love 'She', 'From the Heart', 'No Matter What' (already a big hit in the UK) and 'When You Say Nothing At All'. A lot of great songs that will remind mr of an even better movie, buy it!!!"
5,i love it,this sound track is so good and it has my favorite songs (i do cherish you and when you say nothing at all) the movie is also great. if you havent seen it or havent gotten it yet you should. it has good romantic songs.
5,So romantic....,"I loved this CD....so romantic and still present. I could remember the best moments of my favorite movie and still enjoy beautiful music....and the delivery was perfect. I received in Brazil, ahead of schedule."
4,Great music!!!,"A VERY good soundtrack. I especially LOVED Ronan Keating's cover of Allison Krauss's ""When You Say Nothing at All"". Worth the cost of the CD for that song alone."
1,I wasted my time.,"I'd give a logical and consistent argument for why I thought this was a poor quality book and unworthy of my money and time, but, since I paid for a logical and consistent argument from Ruggie and didn't get it, and this review is free, I feel under no such obligation. Ruggie's argument, and this is one of the biggest problems with multilateral liberalism, is limited to about a dozen countries, namely Western Europe, Canada, the US, and I suppose you can throw in Australia and New Zealand, and he isn't always consistent in dealing with this limited scope. For the other 180 countries, with the exception of Russia, Ruggie's argument has no power and his book says absolutely nothing. If that's what floats your book, read this book. If not, don't waste your time or money."
2,remington ladies epilator,"the batery is only one hour, and it's not really powerfulthe epilator hurts the skin, it shouldn'tbut if your looking for something not too expensive, I think it's not a bad price/quality rate!"
2,NOT AS GOOD AS BRAUN,THIS IS THE THIRD EPILATOR I HAVE USED. IT IS THE WORST. I LOVE THE BRAUN BRAND MUCH MORE.
2,Seems like it would have been great if it hadn't broken on the first day,"I purchased this item as a replacement for an older, broken Remington epilator that I really liked. I thought this would be even better, with the cordless option and two speeds. I used it once with no problems. The next time I tried to use it, the battery was almost dead (it had been plugged in and charging all day). When I plugged it in, it would not turn on. I had to unplug the charging cable in order for the epilator to work at all, and when plugged in, the charging indicator light didn't go on, and it did not charge. I did not receive a packing slip or receipt with my order, so I emailed the company and asked how to return or replace it, and they never responded. I imagine this item would have been great if it had not been defective, but now I'm stuck with it and I wasted $50."
3,not better than Emjoi!,I was used to emjoi which would pluck. This on seems to cut the hair instead of plucking...
5,Good knowledge source,"For anyone looking for tips and tricks on lead generation, this is the book for you. Still relevant today. I recommend for any manager as well."
5,MESMERIZING,Gorgeous restraint and clairivoyant insight reside at the center of David Huddle's second (and finest) novel. How he is able to imagine and weave together the lives of an aging art history professor at the end of her marriage and a young girl entangled in a charged mental dance with a dying painter (La Tour) is nothing short of mesmerizing. I read this book in one sitting and sat stunned at the end.
3,Just lighten up willya?,"The Electric Amish or the Pre-Industrial Revolution fab three are the spinoff invention of the Bob and Tom radio show on WDVE and have developed quite style unto themselves. The song parodies are solid and worth the listen. By the way, the sales of their cds benefit charities."
1,Disappointed by false information...,"I got this book expecting to learn about hormones, progesterone and menopause. Unfortunately this book did none of that! Most of the information contained in this book is undocumented and false. It is simply advertisment for the author who is a chiropractor. Everything he says is followed by 'we can do that testing for you at my office' aka give me more money. It is people like himself that give chiropractors a bad reputation as being quacks!"
5,Very Good Replacement,"It's a horn. It has nearly the same sound as the original, mounts correctly, and the electrical connections are correct. In the end, this is what a replacement should do and is 1/3 the money of the dealer part. No way to know the durability but would have to burn through 3 to break even so looks like a deal."
5,Book Review,"The book is in good shape, it was mailed in secure packaging. Very pleased with service given in mailing the book."
4,remembering the War,"I enjoyed the portrayals of the Yanks in Britain and their relationships with the local people. I liked the scenery, the glance into a World War II home in Britain the dress and in general all of the glimpses in to the past at that time.I know this movie has been criticized as being not too historically accurate, but for a historical, romantic film about World War II I enjoyed it greatly.Kristin Margetts"
4,A nice look back...,"""We'll Meet Again"" is a British series which nostagically looks back at an English town when the Yanks came over to begin their European assault. It is a romantic piece, with a great cast."
5,Great Film,"The scenes between Susannah York and Michael J. Shannon were very convincing. Sussanah York was outstanding in her portrayal of a woman doctor conflicted about her feelings for a US Army officer and her wounded husband. The film tells the story of the American Air Force in Britain prior to D Day. Besides the story of the Major and the doctor, there are several other relationships which depict the problems of US servicemen in wartime BritainThe progression from dislike to love is well told as the major and the doctor face their feelings for each other."
5,dvd review,GREAT SHOW. WATCHED IT AS SOON AS RECEIVED. I ENJOYED IT EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS WHEN i ORIGINALLY SAW IT YEARS AGO. A great love story of WWII Great viewing
5,great cd,"Tia Carrere is awesome and so is this cd. I recommend this to everyone. The best song is ""Love is a cannible"" Tia should come out with another cd......"
2,"Subject: Detroit, Vol. 2","This review is a little bit special..And the reason for that is that the item I got is in fact not the item I purchased..My order was for Subject Detroit vol 2, but I received volume 3 instead.The item i did get however, was in good condition, except the cd cover, which wasquite damaged. But that is probably due to bad postal services though, so I don't blameyou for that..I did not already own a copy of the cd i got, and i am satisfied with it, so no real harm done,but the fact that you sent me something other than what I ordered is not so good i guess..Therefor I won't rate it any higher.. So sort it out..Peace"
4,Buckle broke..,I bought this product for my husband because he wears scrubs to work at the hospital and this way everything is in one place. It's only been a couple of months and the buckle already broke. I would not purchase this item again.
1,Not what I was looking for,"The writing felt very disconnected to me and did not flow well along with bad grammar and use of tenses. The illustrations are beautiful, but the book seems to be written from a girl's perspective, but it is actually written by a man named Patrick Regan. Not that is bad and I can see where he's coming from, but you can tell the words don't come from a mom or daughter. I sent the book back, as it was not for me, my mom or my daughter."
4,Book is too small,"The words are sweet and perfect to address the relationship between mother and daughter. This book is meant to be given from daughter to mother. The art work is stunning. The trouble is that you need a magnifying glass to appreciate the art for all its beauty. The publisher did this book a real diservice by making the book so little. The dimensions are 6.6 inches by 5 inches. I looked to see if there was a full size version, because I would have actually bought another copy if it came larger sized. I could not find a larger copy. If the size doesn't bother you, then I do recommend the book because of the lovely words, art, and how beautifully the mother-daughter relationship is portrayed."
4,Halevy: La Juive,"I listened to the Met brodcast of ""La Juive"" in December 2003 and I was taken! The Opera it's self is badly unproformed, it is possible to say that it is as good as Verdi's ""I Lombardi"" or Puccini's ""Manon Lescaut"". I would say to any one who wishs to buy a recording of this opera to do so.The plot is about the Jews and Christians of Swiss decent.The Jews, thou all the pain of this five act, long, opera win out in the fact that Rachael is a Gentile. Adopted by Elezar.""LA JUIVE"" is a five-act super-mega Opera like ""Les Huguenots"" or ""L'Africaine"" by Meyerbeer, all three with libretto by Scibe, who created Grand-Opera with Meyerbeer. Plot points in ""LA JUIVE"" could be deleted, Elezar does not have to die but Rachael must for the major plot point."
4,Smooth...,"Had no idea who Talvin Singh was. As a matter of fact, for a long time I thought this was a Dave Seaman mix! Imagine my surprise.Quite simply, it's great. It's definitely downtempo but has some cool grooves laced throughout. Another great example of finding some cool songs you might not otherwise here. These DJs are in tune with the world's music in a way most of aren't. As such, they have the ability to weave it all into a glorious tapestry of music.Definitely worth checking out."
2,4 1/2 stars?,"I don't understand the reviews of this album. Jaco was an amazing jazz bassist. But he is so overshadowed by all the brass instruments on this album that the end result is painful to listen to. I counted on the CD insert four trumpets, four sax, four trombones, plus a french horn or two. I doubt he was happy with the end result, I hope it didn't add to his life ending pain. Bill M."
5,The World on the Wall,"Imagine, waking up in the morning and looking at a vast expanse of land in front of you. Many of us keep dreaming about as a way of life most of the time. Given the fact that for most urban dwellers this is not an everyday thing. Imagine if you could do it everyday - atleast be able to think about it everyday.If you do think you want to do something like this... ...A World map is a must for you.A perspective from your little drawing room... an important tool for your children to grow up with... a reminiscence on the time of the past for those elderly... a roadmap of places to visit for those aspirational.It's all in one.Get it on to your wall, get a world view"
5,Cookie Sheets,I search far and wide to find these Aluminum cookie sheet pans of this size for my wife. She is well pleased with them and likes them better than the teflon coated sheets that are every where. They appear heavier than her old sheet pans.
1,don't buy more than 1,"I bought 2 of these sheets for holiday cookie baking because they are oversized and I thought I could get my baking done quicker than usual. That scenario didn't happen because I made the (apparently horrible) mistake of storing 1 sheet on top of the other. Once you stack, game over... there is no prying the sheets apart. A total waste of money!"
4,Quality costs more...,"Purchased for building oak frames for a stain glass project. I had several cuts and needed to get a clean edge. This set is well made and did a nice job. I purchased the set, since you pay $$$ for buying singles. Now part of my tool inventory the kids will get to sell, since this will not be relegated to garage sale table while I am alive. I am giving it four stars just due to cost."
1,The worst wallpaper paste I've ever tried,"This produce seems like it should be the ideal breakfast food, but no amount of sugar or butter or milk will make this produce edible. Really a disappointment because I had such high hopes. I'm not giving up and I intend to try again, but every morning I look at it and decide that this just isn't the day.....maybe tomorrow."
2,Not that great,Quality not great.. The screws are not good the truck is falling apart.I have to use glue.Too many parts too many screws.An adult has to assemble this takes over an hour.Kid is sitting trying to put it together and can't.I can't understand the use of this toy.The kid can't put it together and once it is together doesn't work that well.. keeps falling apart.Poor design poor toy
5,This truck is not Trash!!!,Great truck. Time consuming to put together but well worth the effort. A child's imagination is something to watch while they play with this STURDY truck. It has already outlasted the plastic trucks.
1,"""Garbage"" Truck is right.","Absolute garbage from Melissa & Doug.Shoddy work. Unsteady when assembled. Ill-fitted parts.Wheels don't roll smoothly (I should state that ""the axels don't spin"" as the wheels are screwed in place).Worst of all, the most important part of the ""lifting"" mechanism is barely glued in place. You'll be lucky if the the ""Cargo Lifter"" survives assembly. It certainly won't survive more than 10 minutes of play.I have come to the conclusion that, despite the packaging, this is not a toy. This is a heavy sharp edged dust collector. Once assembled, the best place for this is on a distant shelf on a doily with Hummel figurines."
1,"Not Appropriate for Children, Poorly Made","I put this on a wish list for my toddler, only to discover when it arrived that it was meant for ages 6 and up. My husband had to put it together (way too complicated and intricate for my 6-year-old), and he found the pre-drilled holes were off, it was difficult to follow the instructions, and it was hard to get the pieces to fit together. The finished product has dropped wheels, making it downright dangerous for the variety of age groups in my house. It is also extremely heavy and hard for children to move. It is a hazard and a disappointment and makes me question Melissa & Doug's quality control."
4,GREAT toy for the price!,"My son got this toy for Christmas over a year ago when he was 2 1/2. He is now nearly 4 and he still plays with it a LOT. It is still in excellent condition. The only negative comment I have is that the garbage can connects to the collecting ""arm"" via velcro and is not a very strong hold. Otherwise, this toy is very good quality. My son and husband had a a lot of fun assembling this toy, and he has not stopped playing with it in 1 1/2 years of ownership."
4,Good quality product,"I am impressed with the quality of the toy. I believe my 2 year old will outgrow the toy long before it breaks.It took me about an hour to put it together while I was watching television. It could be done a little faster if needed. The directions are easy, and anyone should be able to put it together. I would recommend an electric screwdriver to make assembly easier and faster."
4,my 8 year old loves it,"Its exactly what it looks like in the picture. My son wanted a wooden truck and this is what he got for Christmas. One thing I didnt realize was that I had to put it together. It was fairly easy but afterwards my hands were sore from using the screwdriver. I had bought the 2 pack tho and had to put together the firetruck also. It seems very sturdy. All of the little pieces are attached with screws also. No glue is used. One neat thing is that the little garbage can has a magnet on it that connects it to the lift to ""dump"" the wooden trash in the truck. Kinda cool :)"
3,fun but hard to build,"We bought this for our son. The truck is very nice and sturdy, but was ridiculously hard to put together. It took us about 2.5 hours to build. The instructions were very unclear, in fact, the pictures lead us to put half of the truck together backwards! The screws were very tiny, and difficult to screw in. Our son has enjoyed playing with it; he especially likes the movable trash dumper in the back. Overall, if you are willing to spend a significant amount of time assembling the truck, you will be pleased with the results."
2,Not a very durable toy!,"My son was very excited when he got this garbage truck, and we had a lot of fun putting it together. However, the screws that came with the truck were not long enough, and the wheels and other parts kept falling off, no matter how tight we pulled the screws. We replaced most of the screws, but the wood is too soft and even the longer and wider screws keep coming loose. Needless to say that my son finally got so frustrated with the toy that he quit playing with it. I though that I had bought an heirloom, but I was wrong!"
4,"Fun truck, but some build issues","Our son really wanted this truck for his 3rd birthday after seeing it online. It was the only thing he wanted. It is nice. The magnetic dumping action keeps him interested. The build could be a bit better. Parts of it went together a bit skewed because the pre-drilled holes weren't in the correct locations. The dowels for the wheels and dumping mechanism were too long, so I put in washers to make them less loose. Nice to have something not made out of plastic."
1,"Nice idea, poor quality","This is a really great idea for a toy. But there are way too many parts to assemble. Very disappointed in final result. I got this truck for my son because he LOVES garbage trucks and I thought this one would be better quality than the other garbage trucks on the market. Boy was I wrong! It looks like a piece of crap once assembled. Pre-drilled holes are off, resulting in the whole thing looking crooked. One wheel doesnt even touch the ground. The velcro that holds on the trash can is pathetic and barely holds it. One piece was missing a sticker, so one side doesn't have a ""door and window"". Save your money and try another garbage truck. I no longer hold the ""melissa & doug"" name up with ""good quality"" -- I've had about 5 M&D toys recently that were very poorly made."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality for a Melissa and Doug toy. Holes for screw are too small, putting the truck together is difficult.Would not recommend."
1,Awful toy for kids!,"I am so disappointed in Melissa and Doug! What kind of toy requires you to take 2+ hours with a tiny Phillips head screwdriver to put it together? Online it looked like it was big pieces to put together, but I would never have bought this if I had known it used real screws -- tons of them -- to put together. Stupid."
4,Great truck!,"This truck is so cute, and my son enjoys driving it around and picking up 'trash'. My husband and I put it together without him though--the building part is out of sync with the age of child that would enjoy playing with it. more like something you would have a 5 or 6 year old build so that his/her 2 or 3 year old sibling could play with. That said, putting it together was easy, we had no trouble with miss-drilled holes as other reviewers for this or similar trucks had. the pieces were high quality and its a nice toy."
1,Bad Product,The item was damged. The wood was chipped and after a long time placing it together the time was waisted because the item was dfective with the wood having a chip in it.
3,there's nothing more I'd like than u dead,I likeded this first cd a much but then this one is in hte mail and not so good but the mailing was #1 and it was still orange.
4,Necta Sweet,"It's great, no bad taste and easy to use. I do wish the company would make a dispenser for it so you don't have to touch it. They have these in Europe. So smart and handy for a party, office setting."
2,I donated mine to the local library,I am wayyy beyond the simple designs and I agree that there were a lot of ugly designs in the book. But maybe someone who checks it out of the library will appreciate it.
4,"Not so hip, but ok...","I really like how the last 2 pages have a guide on how to knit and crochet. The pictures were clear in this section, so if you are just learning how to knit and want a book with some patterns, this is nice. As far as the projects in the book, personally out of the 65 I found 10 that I liked. I wouldn't say the projects are hip persay, but there are some cute ones. The directions are pretty clear, but you need to learn the abbreviations associated with patterns, ex: STS = stitches. Considering the price and how quickly I received it i am pretty happy with the purchase. Since I'm only learning how to knit, I'm sticking with easier projects, but I may try some of the other 55 projects in the book with different stitches and such when I'm a bit more advanced."
4,Hip Knits - Better Homes and Gardens,"Not Hip, but nice. I just picked this book up for $7 at my local book store and you know for $7 it has so ok patterns. I am actually exicted about using it. You know, with some innovation and creativity, you can take a lot of what this book has to offer a long way. I hated it 2 years ago when I first picked it up but I guess tastes change, or I got more creative and open minded. I love that everything is classic. No wrist warmers or bikini's here.All and all, not half as bad as everyone says, but I would say for the some novice and conservative of knitters."
4,Hip? Maybe not hip . . .,"While 'Hip' is in the title, I am not so sure it is in the patterns. This book offers a nice variety of patterns for women, men, teens and children, with, I feel, the cutest patterns being for the kids. It is mostly sweaters with some hats, mittens, scarves, purses and throws in both knit and crochet, though mostly knit. The patterns all seem fairly simple with straight-forward instructions. Most of the sweaters have a very boxy shape, which to me does not equal hip. I think this book would be good for a beginning knitter ready to move on to something with more pieces and shaping than a scarf, but keep in mind that the authors assume you understand how to knit and don't have much of an instructional section."
2,Ok for beginner and that is it,Thank goodness I didn't pay full price for thisbook. There are too many things in here that are not going to be able to be worn more than one season
2,a disappointment,"Definitely disappointed with the projects in this book. They're anything but ""hip."" Most are shapeless, overly simplified patterns. Even beginners can work something more interesting than the projects in this book. While there are a couple of cute items, it's definitely not worth the expenditure. You can find better in knitting magazines or on any of the many sites offering free patterns."
2,Not as hip as implied...,"I am a relatively new and young knitter, and the title caught my eye. But I ended up returning the book. The patterns were boring, not very 'hip' and too easy, even for me. I guess I should have known, as it was compiled by Better Homes and Gardens, which has a very staid idea of hip, it seems. Not recommended."
3,Not For A Beginner,"If you are new to knitting, I do not recommend picking up this book. Hip Knits features 65 easy projects from hot designers. With gorgeous color photos and easy step instructions, you'll find fun and trendy patterns for projects for the whole family ... babies, kids, men and women. From terrific tanks to cozy cardigans, shawls and great guy gear, vests, hats, caps, mittens, and so much more. This terrific book is geared toward the intermediate knitter. A great gift idea!If you're a new knitter, look for a book called Stitch & Bitch.. it's much better and has great patterns for all levels."
5,Life Changing,"I no of no other discipleship material better suited for new Christians and experienced Christians attempting to excel in their walk with God. The interactive nature of the book makes it perfect for one-on-one discipleship and small group study. The truths presented are eternal and life changing, as opposed to shallow and trite. Additionally, the illustrations help simplify some very deep but essential truths."
1,Error in Description of Contents,"This CD was purchased for class work that required item 3 in the description:3. Moz-Art À la Haydn Composed by Alfred Schnittke with Olga Astrachanzew, Wladimir AstrachanzewThis piece is not on this CD."
5,If I told you that. George Michael & Whitney Houston,This is a great song that you cannot find in any compilation or previous album. Combining the fantastic voices of both singers.My rating for the seller is great too. He sent me the CD with an extra case because the original one had a little crack.Héctor...
2,Out of align feet,"My Biesemeyer Miter Table was some what of a disappointment given the feet upon which it stands were out of alignment. Given it is of up most importance to have the miter saw and the miter saw table align perfectly, I had a terrible time attempting to straighten out bent legs and inserting shims to accomplish this goal. Had I not been attempting to open my shop ASAP I would have return them."
3,Poet Laureate?,"Strand's poetry hits the mark of greatness at times, but at others -- which to my dismay seems the more prevalent -- floats along on mediocrity. Perhaps I'm missing something. I was nevertheless disappointed by this collection."
5,Tigers Tale,"The Movie was very thought out and a wounderfull story line ,greatcast and very good people to work with on the film."
3,Majin vegeta,This Majin vegeta action figure is a good buy since majin vegeta was never just a plain saiyan he was always super saiyan this action figure is very good for collecters and it even comes with a Dragonball Z CCG Promo card.
4,Majin Vegeta at last!!,Irwin toy has done a good job in making Dragonballz figures since they began creating their own figure molds. This is the first majin Vegeta ever made. for those who dont know Vegeta becomes majin when he lets Babidi take over his soul. this figure is a great take on vegeta in his majin form. It was originally supposede to be released with goal hair but a manufactoring problem occured resulting in him having his regular black hair. Irwin is fixing the mistake which means this black hair version will be rare!
3,Vegeta-san,"Majin Vegeta was suppossed to be a Super Saiya-jin 2,not the regular Saiya-jin Vegeta,therefore,accuracy isn't in this one,but if you're into it,get some gold mettalic paint and supe him up.But,he's ok though..Good detail."
3,AP student in South Carolina,"This book is strong when discussing free-response questions (DBQ, COT, COMP) and is very informative about the test in general. however, the multiple choice questions in the book are low quality. I bought this book in conjunction with the Princeton Review Cracking the AP World History Exam book. I use that for multiple choice practice and some review, and this for essays and the majority of history review. Overall, it's a worthwhile item to buy, but I suggest investing in another AP book as well."
4,Good Book,I really enjoyed this book. It was very reasonably priced and arrived in a very short period of time.It was an easy read with a great perspective on where Egypt is as a modern society.This book was very helpful in planning a lesson for my Social Studies class.
2,"more 'made in china"" junk",it is what it says it is... but not what i was expecting.. was not impressed...would not recommend to others...pretty lame actually!
2,Undependable gag mirror,"The mirror is not very motion sensitive so most of the time when people pick it up and set it back down, it doesn't respond with the laugh it is supposed to deliver. Disappointing."
2,dated,"This film is rather dated by to-day's standards (story can be told in 30 minutes). The redeeming factor (and the reason for my buying it) is the music of the Cornish Rhapsody. The last 15 minutes of the film present it best. Unfortunately, the quality of the audio is rather poor with it requiring attention to the volume control to bring it to normal hearing standards. I do not fault it being what it was for the times but for the poor attention to quality and volume in the dvd."
1,Not an accurate fit,"Sorry, but the front vents do not fit.The rear window vents fit.Unfortunately to find this out I had to open the packaging and attempt installation and now will not be able to return or exchange this item.Also, I thought these were the 'snap in' type but they are adhesive....very tacky. No pun inteneded."
3,Hannah's Daughters,Passed it along to local church library as it was not what I thought I'd ordered.
2,Stopped working 5 days after warranty expired,Only used it about ten times. Has not even been installed a year but is out of warranty because they count the warranty period from the day that you order it. Computer screen is stuck on DEMO. The repairman that they gave me ( at my expense will not come eto the house) I think that for $800 a microwave should last more than a year.
1,Do not purchase this item- cleaning nightmare!,"I purchased the Sharp Insight range and microwave combo about 4.5 years ago. Works fine, does it job. Nothing special. I should admit that having micorwave in the upper draw is very convenient. BUT! There is a huge BUT!. How do you clean the wall at the very back of microwave, behind the draw. Food gets there, it sticks and thats it. My husbands or my hand doesn't get in there. I tried sprays, towels on spatulas, nothing gets all of it. It's a germ's paradise. I would never recommend this item to any person!"
1,Broken after 10 Months,"Our Microwave broke after 10 months. We were told a repair person would come out and all they did was take our microwave and told us they would call back in a week. $800 for a microwave that is broken in 10 months is not acceptable!! Now we have a huuge opening in our cabinet and a 9 month old without a use of a microwave to sterilize bottles and re-heat my home made frozen baby food, etc.I would NOT buy this brand of Microwave if I had to do it again.I am VERY dissapointed that we could not just get a replacement within the 1 year warranty. 2 days off of work for the repair person to pick up and drop off is another hassle too."
1,6 months and blown up!,"6 months after purchase, unit tripped breaker and quit. 6 weeks later repair service is still waiting for parts. Sharp refuses to replace unit which is under warrantee. NO time limit on their option to fix. Will NEVER buy any Sharp product again!!!"
1,Just arrived and no worky worky.,Drawer does not open and close. Brand new out of the box. Haven't even tried to see if the microwave works but it looks like I made a bad decision. Now on a brand new appliance I have to call for service and that does not look good from here.Do not buy this product!
1,Broken twice with little useage,"In my kitchen remodel I needed a low mounted microwave that my disabled daughter could use. This one seemed ideal. But now we are using the $100 target model in the laundryroom while this expensive junk takes up room in my cabinets. It ceased to open and close immediately. The repairman replaced it. Now, a few months later, it starts and hums, but does not heat. I, like everyone else, have more than I can handle on a daily basis and cannot babysit this appliance or wait for repairmen.Save yourself some angst and buy a throw-away cheap one for the countertop."
4,An impressive debut,"""One part STARSHIP TROOPERS, one part OUTER LIMITS-style psychological suspense... McCarthy cranks up the tension effectively. Recommended."" -- Charles DeLint, Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. .""A short, fast-moving tale of human and alien psychology. The exploration... is well done and fascinating. I like McCarthy's details. Not many authors can create truly alien aliens, but McCarthy appears to be one of them."" -- Janice M. Eisen, Aboriginal SF. .GET THIS BOOK BACK IN PRINT!Happy reading--Pete Tillman"
1,"Do Not Buy, Poor Quality",I have only used it 2 times to cook pasta ( no metal utensils were used in this pot whatsoever) and the covering has already popped and rust is forming inside the pot on the bottom...do not buy....very poor quality
1,"Inspiring Life, But Difficult and Monotonous Read","There is no doubt that Cheryl Heppner rose above her diversity to do many great things. I was particularly excited to know she had an autobiography out, but I must admit I was rather dissapointed at the this book.I started this book four times and three times I couldn't get past the middle. The fourth was forced and I did finish the book. Although it has some interesting insight, it's rather dull and I found myself asking, ""Why has she gone on for four pages about (such and such) boring subject,"" many times throughout the book. I am not insulting Cheryl herself or her life by no means. But to sit through that book again would be ... well, unthinkable and I don't recommend it for reading pleasure. Perhaps for a sleep aid.... That's just this deafie's opinion. :o("
3,Getting on my nerves..,"Hmm mixed feelings about this DVD. I have enjoyed others from the same company: Myofascial, Pregnancy, etc..This one makes use of great graphics in depicting a lot of details along nerve pathways (only the upper extremities folks!). However the presentation and monotone delivery is a little off seeting to my personality (boring). So i digest it in pieces.As far as the many many techniques it claims to teach, well many are very simple and common sense (atleast to myself) so do not hold your breath on redefining your tool box too greatly. People interested in this type of work and serious about bodywork shoulde definitely look into ART (active release technique)- only problem being that they monopolize their products to seminars and big money investments. There are some good things in this dvd, you just have to make it thru the slow hum drum presentation."
5,"Great Man, Great Book","It's sad that as time passes fewer and fewer people seem to remember who Rich Mullins was.That's the way it is with life and time, I suppose.But it's especially sad in this case because the life of Rich Mullins was so extraordinary.For that reason I would recommend this book to anyone. Everyone.It has no agenda. It is not ""preachy"" in its approach. And it does not repeat the tired mantras of conservative Christianity, like so many other titles do.Instead it is an honest account of one man's extraordinary life, and the profound truths we can all learn from it."
5,An excellent biography,This book really captured Rich Mullins. There is so much to learn from the example of Rich's life. I am thankful for having the oppurtunity to be blessed by Rich Mullins works.
5,Update...,"I've finished this book, and all of the chapters were just as excellent as the first three. Reading this book is like seeing snapshots of a life lived according to ""The Ragamuffin Gospel"" by Brennan Manning. The book enforces all of the same points (God's unending grace and love), but with real-life examples and depth. It made me realize that God is much more accepting and forgiving of me than I am, so it has given me something to work on. It would be a great gift for someone who is not too familiar with Rich Mullins, because it has a cd with a song for each chapter. This book is a must for the Christian collection. I will read it many times!"
5,An Exposition on the Love of God,"More than a biography of Rich Mullins' life, this book is an exposition on the love of God. Smith uses Mullins' life, legacy, music and writings to illustrate the ovrewhelming expanse of God's love.I read with a highlighter in hand and almost every page is marked with gems and key points that I will want to use as illustrations. In fact, there could be a complete series of Bible studies on the love of God using the chapter titles of this book as session topics.This book helped me to see clearly the struggles I have with investing in people only as long as they respond to my investment. A clear explanation of unconditional love challenges that approach to ministry.For those who love Rich Mullins' music and those who have (unbelieveably) never heard of Rich Mullins, this book is a key theological statement."
4,Wine bucket,"Durable with the look of glass, without the worry of breaking.I am sure I will have this for years."
5,Sounds like it was recorded today,"Wow, this sounds great! They did a wonderful job and if you are a fan or just like John Barry you wont be sorry you got this. It has a great sound and would be perfect to use to sell speakers to customers."
1,Wrong item,"This item's description is for a Toyota MR2 1991 to 1995, however, the package is for Toyota 1987 and up. You would think it would fit, however, Toyota has a very specific connector for the MR2 which s not this one. It will probably fit the earlier MR2 fine...but the MKII (1991-1995) used a different connector. If you have a MKII, keep looking. :("
4,"Big Fellow, Long Fellow","Picking this up by cahnce I was surprised by the details T. Ryle Dwyer went into. Such intimate looks into the personality's and the main hops, skips and jumps that went along with these two great men's lives. Highly enjoyable and hard to leave at home! Easy to read and sometimes fairly amusing."
2,Surprisingly dull,"Even after hearing about the uneven writing, I was surprised by how meandering and unfocused this book is. It's a mishmash of confused metaphors, irrelevant details, and unclear points. I can't tell whether it's meant to be instructive, or merely illustrative. If you're already familiar with the technologies described, you'll be bored. If you aren't, you'll be baffled. None of the men discussed in the book are portrayed as being particularly interesting, aside from the obvious, though unexplored details of their various technical abilities. I was excited by the subject matter, but put off by the plodding and pedantic prose. It feels like Gilder wrote this while half asleep."
1,very boring book,I was very disappointed in this book. Gilder writes in a very obtuse way and it is hard to connect the dots with him. Save you money.
2,Poor pictures,"The pictures are so poor and blurred that this concert never should have been released on DVD. When purchasing a DVD the customer should expect far better pictures than what this DVD is offering. The selection of songs and arias is excellent, but that can not compensate for inferior pictures."
4,Much better on VHS,I liked most of the selections included on the tape. The sound and video quality were much better on vhs than dvd.
4,"""The Druid Duo""","This wonderful concert reminds those of us fortunate enough to have heard these singers in person of the excitement their outstanding vocalism alone was able to generate. Highpoints here are the fiendishly difficult duets from ""Semiramide"" and ""Norma,"" both of which are sung almost to perfection. Horne is in her absolute vocal prime, moving with ease from lush, long-held low notes to fleet coloratura passages. Sutherland is somewhat past her prime. Consequently, her very highest notes are noticeably thin here, and her release from held notes sometimes has her slipping from pitch. Nevertheless, these are small faults when taken in conjunction with her still mostly present, extraordinary elasticity and power in taking on such demanding duets and arias. Altogether, this concert amounts to a grand night of singing."
5,"Beautiful, well-balanced pendant","This piece is remarkably solid and well-made. The construction is beautiful, the moonstones complement the design perfectly. One bit of warning - the cord is not colorfast, don't get it wet or it will bleed onto your clothes! Overall I am very very happy with my purchase."
4,Very pretty,Very pretty pendant. Actually bigger than I had expected but not in a bad way. Didn't like the satin rope it came with so I just use it on a chain or leather rope. The only downside is that it has tarnished quite a bit but I guess that's just how silver is.
2,Faerie Star Pendant,"I was very disappointed with this pendant. From the picture I couldn't tell how small the moonstones would be. While I like the overall seven-pointed faerie star design, the heavy silver star overpowers the moonstones. The moonstones are much too small."
3,"Great product, but not as pictured","No issue with the quality of the product, but just wanted to write this for anyone else that it might matter to. The bags I received are not clear like those pictured. The ones I received have a big Wilton logo across them. Wouldn't be a big deal except that I purchased these for a craft. Won't look so nice having the logo across the finished product!"
2,Too expensive,"Great bags, but I have a feeling I cld have gotten them for cheaper somewhere else. But they do the job."
3,fast shipping,we have but have not used it yet. it's at our disposal if we need it though. It's a wilton product what else can i write about it.
3,Nice But,"These are nice if you like throw away. They stretch, so you may get a hole near the coupler. When you are decorating a cake you may need many colors of icing. Therefore you may end up using many bags, then throwing them away. I prefer the poly or cloth bags that can be washed and reused time after time."
2,UNsatisfactory,"This was definitely NOT worth the money. I repeat NOT worth the money. From the picture i expected to have the metal point at the front. However it didn't include it and essentially is only household plastic bags with the corners cut. I used to do that, but decided to buy this so decorating would be cleaner, but that is not the case. I would not buy this again."
1,Did not receive,"I received a shipment that contained the pastry bag holder, but my order of pastry bags was not in it"
4,well made coax crimp die,"I like these dies for crimping coaxial cable ends, and they do fit my crimper. there is a problem though in that if you have a quck change tool such as mine they do not lock in place. I made a small dimple on each side of the center hole to solve that problem though."
5,Bargain with the Devil!,"Simon Clark has created a truly monstrous haunted cemetery novel. A true crime writer begins recieving strange notes which request that he leave items (a red ball, a pint of beer) in a giant rundown cemetery next door. At first he resists but bad things start to happen, accidents, coincidences, and he finally gives in. But when you bargain with the Devil you always pay a price. This thriller is true to the classic formula of a small town which hides an ancient evil. The supernatural forces are glimpsed but never fully explained. I strongly recommend this novel for fans of Stephen King or John Saul."
5,It'll hook ya.,"I am not a horror reader, but have been trying different genres to see what's out there. Writing styles, turns of expression, etc. This sounded like a good story, graveyards and all, so I gave it a shot, assuming I'd put it down halfway through, like I do so many books. No way.This book messed with my head. Movies never scare me. I hate to watch horror. But when you read it... it's in your head then, your mind bending and twisting. I actually had nightmares, which I guess means that the author has done his job.This author is very good and I want to read more of his work. My daughter wanted something to read, so I handed her this book. She hasn't been the same since... (Not really, but it did shake her a bit.)"
2,Nothing memorable + not entertaining,"Ordered this based on glowing reviews, and was disappointed. The ending was too depressing, and the story overall really didn't have much in the way of a scare factor. I guess if one is looking for a ""downer"" read, this would be a good book for that. Ended up selling it to local bookstore for far less than paid for it."
4,Clark offers fun reads,"After I read ""Vampyrrhic,"" I just had to get my hands on another Simon Clark book. I enjoyed this one just as much. He has a great feel for atmosphere and makes you feel as if you are in the places he's writing about, standing right alongside his characters. I was surprised by the ending, as it took a little turn I didn't expect. Check this one out for a good creep-out."
2,Wasn't Impressed!,"Judging by all the reviews, I decided to read this book. I am a big fan of Graham Masterton and James Herbert (our other token British horror novelists) so I expected to be wowed by Simon Clark's talent. All in all the book was just mediocre. And most reviews pointed towards this novel being his best. I was rather disappointed. The book just didn't have any guts really! I found myself hurrying through this book to pick up something better. Now if you would like great British horror try Prey by Graham Masteron (awesome!) or anything by James Herbert."
3,"Interesting, but not much of a finish.","I liked 90% of the story--kept my interest, but the ending feels like he just decided ""time to quit typing!"""
3,Print on demand - but it has the essentials,"This is a print on demand book, that looks like it was formatted from a HTML web page, then bound into a loose paperback binding.I've never owned a real, bound copy of this book before, so I can't tell if it really the whole thing. Perhaps it is missing things - I'm not familiar enough with the original to know if this is quality or not.That being said, it is worth the price."
2,Unclear Directions,"Maybe I'm just learning disabled, but I've gone through quite a few books teaching the fundamentals of several areas, and this one doesn't seem to explain them in a way that's very clear.Hopefully if I decide to continue reading it I will find the rest of it easier to follow, but the graphics and pictures are small which doesn't help."
4,Fantastic Book,"I've been going through this book for a few weeks, learned a couple tricks, and I've been pleased with the quality of the instruction. Sometimes, I find myself supplementing the descriptions with youtube videos, but this book definitely provides the road map. A must have for the aspiring magician."
4,The Best Starting Place For Card Magic,"Just like I titled my review this is the BEST place to start card magic. It's a low cost investment to the art and has some seriously amazing routines inside. This will cover things like the double lift, the glide and other basics that are key. Not only does it teach this but has a ""lesson plan"" built into the book. It actually advises following the order, learn the sleight and pick two effects to master from that chapter which is great. A lot of book just say ""have fun"" and don't really have a guideline for how to learn from it. It also has great tips on presentation inside kind of like a Kard Klub intro (DVD by Brad Christian) to get you really blowing minds. Let's face it, it's not about the sleights it's about how well you present the effect. A simple key card effect can really amaze people if you present it as a miracle.Buy the book it's worth having about even if you only read it for kicks and giggles."
5,Must Have Fantastic Classic,This is the must have classic of card magic. I bought this book in 1978 and studied it religiously. This is the book to have if you are serious about mastering the skills of card magic that will make others beleive that you have real powers. This book takes you through all the basics of card control and helps you apply them to the tricks that will astound your audience and make them believe that you are a real master of the art of card magic. This is the book to get and master.
4,Card handling is not easy....,"This book is great for learning different card handling and shuffling techniques, however it can be a little tuff to follow sometimes. If you dont already have a basic understanding of how to handle cards you might want to start with a video first. It's usually a bit easier to learn when you can actually see whats going on. A side from all that, this is a really good book."
2,Can be very hard to read/understand,"I'm having fun with this book, but at the same time i get extremely frustrated with it! i love doing the tricks, but some (about 1/4) instructions are just written very poorly, then i give up on that trick :(i'm needing to read some tricks over and over to understand the mechanics of it (not becuase the trick is hard to do, but because i can't figure out exactly WHAT TO DO, becuase the instructions are unclear, and the english is funky) i recommend the a newer version of this book which might have better english. GET THE NEWER ONE!"
2,Needs better graphics,"I got as far as page five, then I was unable to follow the graphics as compared to the text. Perhaps I am just learning disabled...."
4,Content Useful. Patter Dated,"The book covers basic card control, the glide, the glimpse, the key card, the palm, the backslip, false shuffles and cuts, the double lift, the pass, reverses, the classic force, top and bottom changes and use of arrangements. It also contains 76 tricks, of which about 25% are excellent, 50% are unremarkable, and 25% are weak. You'll get more than enough usable material, including many classics of card magic.This book itself is rightly regarded as a classic of magic. However much of the suggested patter is overly formal, reflecting the style of the late 1940's, when it was written. There are illustrations, but no photographs.The book is aimed at complete beginners, but provides material that would be of use to anyone interested in card magic."
4,A book every woman and man should read,Bem is a pretty cool psychologist who lives her life in a way to test the theories she proposed. It really helps those who want to raise their kids in a non-sexist and gender aschematic way to gain more insights of the practical issues in doing that. I really appreciated that being a researcher Bem was able to share her personal life to others so as to illustrate the gender related problems and struggles in our society.
5,"Biesemeyer T-Square, Outside/Cut-off Miter Stop","I ordered it on Friday and received it on Monday. I was expecting it to take at least 7 days. Needless to say I was very pleased with the shipping timeframe. I product is great, very high Quality, it looks like it will last a lifetime. Packaging from the Manufacture was first class all the way. There is no way you will receive damaged goods from this maufacturer, unless of course it get's run over by a semi-truck."
1,NOT BLONDIE,"A sad shame that Ms. Harry has fallen so far from the glory of her Blondie days. The cd can not make up it's mind if it was to be a Blondie sound a like, or a Modanna sound a like, or something in between. ""I Can See Clearly"" is hands down the best song on this outing, and it's not great. It really doesn't sound like any thing she has done before. Skip this cd if at all possible."
2,Disappointing,Just a list of books. Very few have recipes. I was hoping for old different recipes. What I found was mostly trite hackneyed Jello salads and green bean cassaroles from the fifties. The older recipes I did find had totally nebulous measurements i.e. 2 tosses of flour or a fist of sugar. Many had no amounts just a list of ingredients. A few were interesting however very few.
3,"stable, small, nice, horrible ram support",no ide support for linux or any other os other than windows xp ... very sad this motherboard is really nice .. also it has very horrible ram support .. bios is kinda flimsy too
5,Back For My Love,This is my favorite freestyle song of all time! Stefanie Bennett has an awesome voice along with Paradigm. The bass will blow your mind. A must have for every true freestyle fan.
3,good history but the man remains a mystery,"This is a lengthy book full of interesting historical material. But, as for the man himself, I never got the feeling that I was getting more than a sketch of him. Could any author do better? McM had more than his share of quirks and he didn't suffer fools, or anyone else, gladly, so perhaps there is no way anyone will ever get too deep into the mind of the man. The main thing I took away from the book is that Robert R. McCormick was a good businessman and the oddest duck of his time. The book is not a difficult read but, after reading it, the man remains a cipher. After a detailed accounting the war with FDR, the author seemed to rush to get to the end of RRM's life. Far from being a sympathetic character, pathetic more easily comes to mind. RRM had lots of power and plenty of money but he lived in a very cold world of his own that it appears no one during his life, or readers of this book today, can enter."
3,Geared more toward adults,"I bought this book to teach to high level middle and high school students of English in Korea. The topics are really focused more toward adult learners of English, and some of the themes are somewhat outdated (i.e. a speaker going to a Tina Turner concert). Also, for teaching students in another country (such as Korea) some of these references are totally lost. I see the potential in the book, but it won't work for my students.Also, notice that the book and cassette are sold separately and are pricey when combined."
4,Colourful book,"I liked the quick technique for the patchwork bags explained in this book, but still feel that the bags in the first book have the edge. As usual the photograpy is fabulous, and the colours are a feast for the eyes. If I had to buy only 1 book, I would buy the first one though."
3,Gag gift,These itemes were bought as a gag gift for a christmas party. They went over really well since no one had any thing like these.
5,great gag gift,"my friend always says he needs to keep his head down when we play golf, when he opened his gift he started laughing right away. great gift."
4,A necessary purchase for Easy Bake owners!,"This is what you've been waiting for if you've had enough teeny weeny cakes that cost...If your child can't get enough of her Easy Bake, you need this book! Some of the recipes need minor alteration, like more sugar or what not, but just knowing the proportions that will fit in the pan is so great, we don't even care. I wasn't looking forward to dividing all of my big cake recipes by 16, but this mom has done that already. There are even big batches of mixes you can make ahead and then just add liquid to if you want a quicker baking project. The brownies are delicious!! Also, the itty bitty measuring spoons (1/8, 1/16, 1/32) are adorable and useful. My daughter is proud to have her own utensils and cookbook to go with her oven."
4,Child Cook Book Review,"I gave this cook book 4 stars because I looked through it and it is more for young, young, children. It should be for children 4 yrs. to 7-8 yrs. The recipies are very good though.I think if you have young children and they like to cook this would be a very good present for them. They'd enjoy it. I know I did."
1,Bad book,"I'm not a good writer but an avid reader. This book is left wing, liberal garbage disguised as a history book.Stay away from it."
4,needed to be all diana,"its christmas time should have become a christmas classic!! i so love this song, it is hard to wait till christmas to hear it! i only wish every song were with diana, even though they are very well done songs!! buy it if you don't have it!! i have two copies!!"
3,Caveat Emptor,"This is the only recorded meeting between Jackie McLean & Ornette Coleman.... except there's a catch: Coleman only plays trumpet on the recording. O.C. on anything but alto saxophone is an acquired taste, I think. Billy Higgins is on drums, recalling J-Mac's sublime _Let Freedom Ring!_, but the rest of the group is Scott Holt on bass and Lamont Johnson on piano. This album deserves a listen, but more as a curiosity than as being one of the two principals' most important moments. The best track is certainly the title-track, a terrific gospel workout, & the album's worth getting just to hear that."
3,mixed bag,"For my tastes, this album was a definite mixed bag. The opening track, ""Lifelong,"" is a sprawling four-part piece that is much more avante garde than previous Jackie McLean compositions that I've heard. Frankly, I don't really enjoy this track. But the next song, an Ornette Coleman piece called ""Old Gospel"" really picks up the pace. True to the title, this is an old school Gospel jump-up-and-shout track. The final track, ""Strange as it Seems"" is also a Colemen piece, but not really as exuberant as the previous track. Still, though, a very good composition. Those with an interest in, or tolerance for, the more avante garde style of jazz, may appreciate the first track, but I thought that was an overly long experiment that never really clicks, and a big contrast to the other two pieces on here."
5,phenomenal,"phenomenal blend of new age digital composition and traditional eastern and middle eastern vocals and instrumentals. I love almost all the tracks, and haven't heard such high quality and immense variety of both innovative composition and singing in a 'world' CD. The tracks are connected seamlessly to each other by samples of street sounds, voices, digital sounds, etc. If you are a fan of rai, Indian gypsy, or any middle eastern or eastern genre, you'll go crazy over this CD. If you're not, you're still in for an aural feast."
5,Belly Dance Music & Soothing Tracks,"I am listening to the CD right now, and it is so relaxing. There are a handful of sings suitable for belly dancing, upbeat and energetic, such as Track 12. Other songs are so intoxicating, you may just want to use it as soothing background music in your home for a nice evening. I'm happy I have this one!"
5,"Unique, fun, impressive, with flawless production values.","The Third Planet is a unique and impressive blending of reggae, ragas, fun, and futuristic electronics. This audio showcase of Italian, North African, Asian, and pop culture takes the listener on a global excursion immigrating into the 21st Century. Featured are The Third Planet (5:04); Mektoub (5:12); Salam Salam (5:03); N'Satni (4:49); Sulimani (4:51); Raghupati (6:09); Karwan (6:20); Dylan E'Jerbaaran (3:28); Baghdad Rai (6:14); Besaurari (4:14); Esmer (4:30). Total Time: 60 minutes."
3,It just doesn't work,"If you're looking for smart melding of world music sensibilities with a jazzy Western vibe, you're looking in the wrong place. Way too synth-heavy for my tastes, with a kind of annoying trance sensibility, it may appeal to someone who's looking for a world-music aesthetic mapped onto a kind of syntehtic New Agey/anachronistic electronic thing.For music with similar intents that actually works, try instead John Wubbenhorst, Safa, or Omar Sosa."
4,Great Read!,"I enjoyed reading the book. It was a quick read, I didn't want to put it down. I know the story of Esther, and enjoyed how the book helped me relate to the times and trials. I hope to see more from Rebecca Kohn."
5,Beautifully written,This is a gripping tale of a strong and beautiful woman. I was moved by this story.
4,Very Good,"I thought this was a very good book. As for historical accuracy, not so sure. Its more....'trashy', for lack of a better word, then The Red Tent, and I wouldn't recommend it to my ministers wife, but I enjoyed it. Fast paced, it didn't stall out @ all. I really was sad when it was over, I miss the characters, which is exactly how a book is supposed to make you feel."
2,Promising but fails to deliver,"This is one of those books I found most promising and I wanted to like it even more. But it gets to be boring and it doesn't completely deliver. The idea is there. And it has an excellent start but then it doesn't lift off. Still, it can make a good easy read. The characters are quite one-dimensional, particularly the heroine Queen Esther, who never truly comes to life. Historical fiction is such a hard genre and this book proves it. Yet, it is not completely bad. It has its moments."
3,Not Bad...But...,"""The Gilded Chamber"" had a big display in my local bookstore last year, with a sign announcing that those who enjoyed Anita Diamant's ""The Red Tent"" would love it. Since I did love that novel, I had to give ""The Gilded Chamber"" a try.It was...okay. Esther's story should be told, and I love the concept of fleshing it out from the female perspective. However, Kohn's writing is a little formulaic. After the first dozen pages, you already know what Esther is going to do and say. You know what she will accomplish, and you know how it will end. It is a very predictable read.Still, it isn't written poorly. It is certainly several notches above the kind of book you just can't get through. And given time, Kohn could improve her talents. I think she is capable of really writing something on par with ""The Red Tent,"" eventually."
2,disappointing,"The story of Esther is one of the most exciting tales in Bible. If you can get past the archaic format, you can see the makings of an amazing and passoinate epic: an orhpan girl, taken against her will into the king's harem, rises up despite the odds to become a queen and her people's savior. Esther could have been smart and cunning, or a heart-warming anti-heroine, or a dozen other distinct characters. Instead, she's just boring. Khon takes the ancient text and rewrites it in modern language, adding some filling, but nothing new or fresh. The characters are one dimensional and the narrative is flawed.All in all a very disappointing retelling of a tale with a lot of potential."
2,Bland and Boring,"I would really like to give this book a good review because the subject matter is surely captivating, but I found the book to be bland and redundant. Esther comes across as weak and almost whiny. I couldn't wait to get to the end just so I could stop reading the author's limp text and over-extravagant description of everything. Not reccommended."
1,NOT a book for all ages.,"I was really looking foreword to reading this book, Because it's about one of my favorite subjects (Queen Esther).But I ended up reading only 2 or 3 pages and closed the book,because I couldn't believe how graphic (sexual) it was...and I'm sorry but I was Disgusted by it.Now I know and love the story of Queen Esther very well, so i fond this book very distasteful.And also it's NOT a book for all ages."
2,This is no Red Tent,"For those of us expecting a novel like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, this book is a big disappointment. The Red Tent is about women's relationships with each other, and tells of -albeit fictional- background that may help our understanding of Biblical events. This book is written by and about one person, Esther. Esther is clearly the innocent heroine, the perfect victim who rises to every occasion as she is prepared for one task, to sexually please King Xerxes (known to many of us as King Ahasueros).This is a romance novel! That's the only explanation and the only possible category for it. Pity, because it appears that the author did a good amount of research into the history and lifestyles of the harem and royalty. But it's a romance novel, with the girl and the two men, one the beloved and one the powerful. It's an overdone theme, and it's not worthy of the story of Esther."
3,Not quite comparable with THE RED TENT,"Having seen all the comparisons with Anita Diamant's THE RED TENT, I knew that I had to read this book. I can't say that the comparisons were valid. While the story and topic were interesting and the writing fast and easy to follow, I can't say that I ever felt captivated or motivated to continue. Although I did finally finish the book, it never had that ""can't wait to get to the next page"" feel. And the ending was so anti-climactic! One question bothered me throughout: Why was Esther so head-over-heels in love with her cousin and unwilling to let go of an impossible dream of being with him? She barely knew him and he showed no signs of returning any of her affections. Enough said..I won't blow the whole story for you."
4,LOVED IT!,"This book stuck with me for a few days, I loved this version of what possibly could have happened. It's a short enough read--doesn't take long to finish--you'll enjoy it!"
2,Not faithful at all,"This book was a quick read, but it was deeply flawed. To begin with, in place of depth of information about the time period, we get repetition, such as constantly describing the same beauty regimen. Esther isn't much of a character; she comes across as a bored whiner. Mordechai is basically slandered by Kohn's writing that he's discarded his faith and only rediscovers it at the end. The Book of Esther is short but there are many explanatory stories that flesh it out pretty well. Kohn seems to have either not heard of them or ignored them so anyone who knows the Book of Esther and the other stories will find this book very unfaithful because only the bare bones of the plot have been kept. Finally, the Gilded Cage is billed as a feminist story, yet it is anything but. One of the subtexts in the Book of Esther is that men and women need to respect each other, while in the Gilded Chamber this is completely missing."
3,A Fast Read,"Interesting story and certainly removed any illusions I may have had about life in a Harem. Better than ""The Red Tent"". Highly recommend ""The Other Boelyn Girl"" by Philipa Gregory and ""Katherine"" by Anya Seyton. Really talented writers."
2,meh,"What started out really interesting, swiftly became tedious after about the 10 billionth time a room, garden, or outfit was described for 6 pages.I don't know. There just wasn't much depth here and the ending was weak. It was almost as though the author got reeeallly tired and just said ""Screw it, this is the end.""The more I think about this book, the more I just saymeh."
3,Bath toys,"My son is 2.5 and interested in all kinds of toys but also picky. We use these in the bath for now and he's mildly interested in them. These are fine toys and when he's ready to dive for them in the pool, all the better. If you're looking for that, these are great toys- they go straight down to the bottom."
5,An absolute gem,"""Loading Mercury With A Pitchfork"" is the most insightful and interesting book of poetry that I have ever read. Having not been familiar with Brautigan, I was shocked when I picked this book of the school library shelf to find the poems not rhyming or even melodious in their length. What I found was a mix of short insightful, witty, intellegent, and sometimes bizarre sketches from a truly gifted writter. This is a book that can be enjoyed in any form by anyone."
5,Really Observing,"The picture on the cover of my copy shows that Richard Brautigan let his hair grow long. The title ought to make it obvious that this book is by someone who has seen the total collapse of concepts like integrity. The poems included in this book were written from 1971 to 1976, a bit after Richard Brautigan's popular triumphs. Page 41 is not quite the middle of this book, but it is where he confronts ""The Necessity of Appearing in Your Own Face."" The obvious thing about it is ""you have to be there."""
5,Great for wrapping insulation,"This stuff is great for wrapping fiberglass insulation on furnace piping. Sealing joints and corners with duct tape works ok, but will unwrap as the tape ages. This is easy to cut and shape around the pipe and corners. What is great is the fiberglass gets sealed in under the cloth and away from your skin so you don't get itchy when changing filters or working around the furnace. Nice professional look too.Simply wrap the pipe and let it dry. Then paint the cloth to make it water tight."
5,scenery maker,I received the Plast'r Craft very quickly. I used this to create props for scenery for a play. It was perfect! It went a long way. A lot of Plast'r Craft comes in a 20 pound box! It was easy to use and created sturdy props.
1,"Fourth of July, Sparkly Sky (Sparkle n Twinkle Books",I paid $12.53 for a book that originally cost $4.99. My daughter ordered it for her daughter and the entry on Amazon indicated that a video was to come also. Only a an 8 page cardboard book! I emailed the vendor 3 times trying to return it and have never received a response. Don't get sucked in!
3,"Color is pink, not red ruby.","If your looking to get this as a ""birthstone"" gift for someone dont...its way more pink than red. While its a great piece I got it for someone for a birthday present and there birthstone is ruby well that went out the window when it arrived its so pink I honestly dont think they will even know its rubys...unless I tell them. So I dont event know if I will give it to them or return it."
5,This stuff is great,"We have a rescue dog that ""submission pees"" due to fear of humans. This stuff is great and really stops the urine stain from smelling or staining. This is indespensable for any dog owner who is pottie training their dog. I have tried the others, and this is by far the best."
2,Did Not Work,"Maybe my dog is just crazy, but I would spray this stuff all over something he was licking and it did not really stop him."
1,My dog ignores it,"My dog doesn't even seem to notice when this is applied and justs ignores it. She's a beagle, too, so she is VERY scent driven!"
3,Tarp Straps just ok,"NOt sure how long these straps are going to last. Im am already seeing thousands of small hair line cracks in them. Might just be the outer coating, won't know until I have had them a little longer. I have never seen my other straps crack so quickly. They are also not very stretchy."
3,Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry Callahan,"My how times change!Back when Dirty Harry was all the rage was such a different age. I enjoyed Clint Eastwood in both these films, as the good Irish detective stacked up against City Hall. Add in spectacular shots of San Francisco in Blu-ray, and both movies worked well for the era.Now we see how Clint Eastwood was evolving as a pretty good film maker, which reminds me to rent The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."
4,Wonderful Chinese Grammar Book,"This is a fantastic book, recommended only for serious learners of Chinese. This is a book you can use during your whole life of learning Chinese. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is the author is so pedantic. The author should use language to speak to real people, not other linguists. However, this is a wonderful, very technical book. I still need a more simpler book on Chinese grammar, but do not regret having this book."
3,Way Too Expensive,"This book must be used in a college setting due to its price. It seems college books are automatically priced 50 to 75 percent more than non-college books. I ordered this book and had it returned due to the size/content vs price. This would be an excellent book for around 30.00.I think the content is good but should have much more examples and explanations.If the book was priced at around 30.00 and had more examples and explainations I could give it 5 stars.For an alternative, I found A Reference Grammar of Chinese Sentences by Henry Hung-Yeh Yee to be a better selection for me."
3,Reads like a medical book,I just received this book and gave up reading it after the first few pages. It's definately a reference book but seems to be a thorough reference book. There are many linguistic terms that the reader will also need a dictionary. This makes the book a bit hard to read. It's more for advanced students. I've been studying Chinese for a year and wanted something a bit easier to read without too much detail. I'm going to return this one and try Basic Chinese : A Grammar and Workbook by the same author.
2,A cheaper alternative,"I was looking for a Chinese reference book that explained complements and the verb aspect system. My Chinese instructor recommended _A Chinese Grammar for Foreigners_. Most likely, you will find it used (as it is sold to foreigners living in China) at around $20. The book provides examples of sentences in simplified Chinese and English. The layout is not the most ideal, but it provides a systematic approach to understanding the language."
2,What?,"This is an odd one. At first, I erroneously thought that the authors were British. When they had American characters saying ""maths"", I put this down to a gruesome and horrific lack of research on the part of the authors and prepared to put it down unread. Then I did some research and found out that the authors were American. So why the British quotes, spelling, grammar, etc? Because it was typeset, printed and bound in the UK. From an American manuscript. Anglicizing the entire content of a huge manuscript in American English is about the funkiest and most pointless thing I have ever seen. Ever. Especially when they release it on the American market. I can't be the only American to find this so odd that it detracts from the story. I would like to find a volume printed in the US. I doubt very much that I have the patience to finish all four volumes published this way. My loss, I guess."
3,Worth a read,"I liked this story, but only give it 3 stars because I found it frustrating to be constantly switching between characters. Just when you are getting involved on one group of characters' storyline, you would be switched to another. They are all good, but I wish more time was given to each.None the less, it is an intelligent addition to a field too often regarded as ""kids stuff""."
2,Just doesn't hit the mark...,"I tried like hell to like this, but ultimately couldn't get more than about 250 or so pages into it. An interesting world, and a decent plot, are killed outright by just plain poor writing. The dialog is unbelievable with a strong tendency towards long and unnecessary exposition, and the narration is hyperbolic and overly detailed. Like I said, the plot itself had some real potential, and maybe it gets better later on, but I couldn't stick with it to find out."
2,"Good ideas, bad writing","The Hickory Staff is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the basic ideas are pretty good. I like the storyline, overall. However, it's full of the most awful cliches and lazy writing imaginable. Imagine a movie adaption of The Loard of the Rings, but this time directed by John Woo and starring Vin Diesel and you'll be just touching the edges of how cheesy this book gets.I did a search on Amazon for the authors and one of them seems to be a true crime writer, which would explain the penchant for being constantly overly-melodramatic. (Imagine a Steven King story as told by a 13-year old drama queen.)The characters are paper-thin. There is no real depth to them and their emotions and reactions are canned responses with all the sophistication of a beer commerical.This book gets two stars for the ideas and nothing at all for the story-telling itself."
3,second album curse?,"Tribe's first album ranks up with the best albums ever to come out of Boston, and yes, that includes the Cars, Aerosmith, J. Geils and Boston. It missed the horrible production that seemed to doom so many promising others like O Positive, The Atlantics, Robin Lane, and the Nervous Eaters when they made it to the majors. So one has to wonder what happened. Too quick a followup? Anyway, there are a few good tracks, Supercollider, Red Rover, Sing to Neptune, and the title cut. Others like Romeo Poe, Crawl, Mr. Lieber and Smile, have some good moments, but are misses. The rest are just not very good. Don't know whose fault it is, the producer or the band, but its a real disappointment."
3,A weaker album than their first,"This is the 1993 second album by the Boston alternative rock band Tribe. Their first album, Abort, is a definite five-star affair and should by rights have been a big hit. ""Sleeper"" isn't in the same league. The songwriting and production aren't as strong as on ""Abort"", and the single ""Supercollider"" wasn't catchy enough to grab the attention of newcomers. But there are three great tracks: the wistful ""Red Rover"", ""Crawl"" (with its hyperactive chorus about ""the spiny fish are breaking the barrier""), and ""Dogflower"". Look for ""Abort"" first, and come back for ""Sleeper"" later if you liked ""Abort"".(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
3,Super Reader,"Here, three people discover a dead person, and then further discover that they have the Night Warrior ability, and at night, must enter people's dreams to fight off some evil, and some not inconsiderable risk to themselves.Just average people during the day, the whole hero thing does not come naturally to them."
5,Muscular folk/pop blend,"This five-song EP is full of spark and life. Harding gives his all to the material, and the result is a high-energy (without being over-powering) program. You can hear some clear Beach Boys influences combined with the Byrds in Harding's songs, and he combines the best of both in this disc."
5,Gotta have,"I lost this cassette, when my car was robbed a few years back. I decided to buy it again. Any one who even remotely likes rap should have this. Its Ice Cube's first solo c.d. and he really produced."
1,Cube without Dre,"Like the title says,the production on this record is terrible. Which makes most of the cd terrible If you liked straight outta compton you probably won't like this one, too ""east coast"" for me."
1,Garbage,"Ice cube SUCKS. He soulda stayed with N.W.A and made another classic like ""Straight Outta Compton"" and avoided making trash like this."
5,Hip Hop Gansta Rap Classic!!!,"I remember back in the day when this album dropped. We didnt know what to expect. NWA had the fans in their corner and we all thought Ice Cube was ill for leaving NWA. But then something happened....... ICE CUBE hit us all with something never really heard before. It was a whole album of Boyz n the Hood and Dopeman all in one. Ice Cube continued owning the streets respect and held the crown til Dr. Dre dropped ""The Chronic"".I also recommend: ICE CUBE ""Death Certificate"" cd. Another classic cd by one of rap music's best lyricist. Ice Cube is definitely no dummy on the mic."
3,The Bamboo Cage,"I first read this book at the age of 23 while I was a Sergeant in the Marine Corps. I was angered, disgusted, and deeply disturbed by this book. I intentionally left the book in the Squad Room of the barracks and never saw it again. After 15 year of searching I finally found it here and ordered myself a new copy.This book is still as disturbing to me as it was back when I first read it. It has a large number of ""facts"" however upon further research thanks to the internetwhich was not available to me when I first read the book, I found numerous errors. I still believe that its a good book, but can not look upon this book as a definitive account. There are just too many errors."
1,Very disgusting,"I borrowed this documentary from the local library, thinking it was a cute dog movie like 'Hotel for dogs', or simply local SPCA's ad. It turned out to be a disgusting unemployed woman's lonesome cry for men, sex, and a close shot of a picture of dog mating. she would stand on the street asking strangers(men) whether they are married. she is looking for a mate for her dog. Can she find one for herself, sort of things.it is very disgusting. she is using the dog as an excuse. Dogs want to be dogs. they do not care about their outfit, sunglasses in 'heart' shape, and engagement party with another male dog. Please do not watch it."
4,Better than the FRAMs of old.,"Never was a fan of the old Fram oil filters that appeared to be nothing more than cardboard in a can.These are actually pretty cool.The ""grippy"" rubber like top they put on them is a really good idea.I picked one of these up at Wally World (Overpriced, buy them here on Amazon) as they didn't have anything else to fit our Van. After struggling to remove the old filter which seemed to be welded on and actually punching a hole in it during removal, The grippy coating on this filter was a welcome relief to my oily hands and made hand tightening a breeze.Well done FRAM!Finally a product worthy of my vehicles."
3,Romanticos de Corazon,"I am Australian & unfortunately, do not speak Spanish, but Marco's music & voice explains it all to any non-Spanish speaker, particularly in his later Albums.La Historia Continua...... ""The best of all!"" BrilliantLa Historia Continua Parte 3 is good (but not as good)Razon de sobra, also excellent!Trozos de Mi Alma is a good disc with some good tracks, and his DVD,The Marco Antonio Solis ' Grandes Exitos En DVD' is supurb.Grandes Exitos En DVD with Los Bukis is nowhere near as good.I wish he would do more DVDs"
2,"Not for ""middle mouse click"" users","I purchased two of these, and they perform well except for one quirk. The click wheel in the middle is stiff and unresponsive. If you rely on using the middle mouse button to select items on a webpage, avoid this model. I often have to click several times to get it to work; in the process, the wheel moves and I am no longer on the area I am trying to select. I will be replacing this product with another soon!!!"
2,"Nice mouse, horrid wireless","Mouse has a nice feel but is not consistently smooth in operation. Missed button clicks, sluggish mouse movement, and other wireless oddities ruined the experience for me. I returned for a full refund."
2,Felt like a left-handed mouse,"I'm a right-handed person, but somehow the fit was not very comfortable in my right hand, even though it is a large mouse, and i am comfortable using a variety of mice. Moreover I was looking for something without the extra receiver it comes with. went with a bluetooth mouse, since my laptop is bluetooth enabled. I'm happy ever since."
5,Better than Intellimouse Wireless Explorer,"I replaced my MS intellimouse wireless explorer with this and this one is much better. That one was big and clunky and I never used those side buttons. This one has the tilt scrolling wheel for left and right scrolling which I find very useful. This also has a smaller footprint and easier to hold. It is symmetrical, so easier for left or right handed operation. Amazon's gold box deal made this almost as sweet."
3,Luggage,The problem I have with this item is that the wheels do not revolve as they should.I am writing to the company to see what can be done about this problem.
3,Not sure if it will last,"After reading many positive reviews, I decided to purchase this luggage. I love the look and the bags hold a lot! The design is woven, not printed, and after only one flight I noticed several spots where the thread is beginning to unravel, and both of the bags I used have places on the bottom where the vinyl is coming apart from the cloth. I realize airlines are hard on luggage, but I would expect them to hold up better. I really like this luggage...I hope it lasts."
5,THESE COLPIX ARTISTS SHINE ON THIS CD!,"I was so pleased to see this Import CD come out. I can't tell you how much. Not only are the songs in True Stereo (thank you Producer Stu Phillips) but this collection is more complete than the Colpix Story 2 CD set. On Triangle, we have the inclusion of James Darren's ""Gidget"" along with Paul Peterson's ""She Rides With Me"" (the only song not in stereo). Then there are the big hits by Shelley Fabares, Darren and Peterson. All here! The songs follow the original format of the original albums. The CD package is pleasing to the eye, also! This is a real winner! Nuff Said!!"
1,worst purchase,"I bought this high performance wires, they came with a set of wire plugs and connectors that were not compatible with my vehicle I had to buy another set to use the wires, meaning this package came incomplete, because the new set I bought came with two different to types of connectors, so I could choose the right connectors, if you buy this item chech first it comes with two sets of connectors or return it."
5,Helpful and well-done dictionary,"I bought this dictionary after my english teacher's suggestion, and I'm very happy of this purchase.This Dictionary is perfect for people who need to improve their english skills.There are a lot of examples, a complete list of phrasal verbs and expressions. Differences between british and american english are well highlighted.The attached CD-ROM is very helpful too. It contains british and american pronounciation tool and a good search engine.Only a little problem about this software: it requires an old version of QuickTime (included in the CD) and it doesn't work with recent versions."
5,Marvellous Book,"This is a book that is truly liberating. It should be read by each and everyone of us brought up on a diet of undiluted Eurocentrism. An amazing journey through history and cultures, one is left at the end of it wanting more. For someone with a limited and frightening exposure to school math, the level and literary clarity makes much of the math quite palatable. Would unreservedly recommend the book. I would be amazed if at the end of it one's perception of mathematics has not changed for ever."
4,"Good and informative, if needlessly polemical","A very fine book about non western mathematics, concentrating in such civilizations as Ancient Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, the Arab world, and to a lesser extent, precolumbian civilizations. There is a lot of information here. Unfortunately, the book is unnecessarily polemical. To highlight the contributions of non western civilizations to mathematics, Gheverghese feels the need to belittle all the time the western contributions to mathematics, which any independent observer would say were crucial ones. A worthwhile book for those interested in the topic, nevertheless."
5,Making Sense Of Millennium,"This is EWF's second album of the 90's and their best up to this point.The funk tracks (and there are many) are good even if they tend to be very hyperactive but it's the album's more unusual moments that catch fire 'Sunday Morning' and 'Honor The Magic' are the standouts to me,as is the lilting 'Divine'-the latter two have a new slinky sexuallity not even heard on EWF numbers.'Superhero' is penned by Prince and while being very modern and 'new' doesn't try to burry the bands own organic talents in another artists idea-Prince let EWF sound like themselfs and that,even if this is'nt even close to one of their classic albums,is very much worth it to those with more then a casual interest in the group and a MUCH needed improvement on 1990's pandering 'Heritage'."
3,Not Bad but not there Peak Level either,"I got this Album when it first came out&I liked a few tracks.""Sunday Morning"" was nice&in step with EWF.I was most Curious about Prince's ""Super Hero""&that song's Lyrics hit the Spot, but Musically it was Average at best.""Wouldn't Change a Thing about you"" is cool.overall this Album had some moments but overall not quite as Good as ""Heritage"".I Look toward there Next Album whenever it finally does drop."
4,Adem's Cross,"The author has traveled to Kosova/Kosovo, both before and after the NATO airstrikes there, and is currently active in attempts to release Kosovar Albanian prisoners held by the government in Belgrade. In Adem's Cross, the author attempts to depict rural life in Kosova/Kosovo during Serb rule, from the perspective of a Kosovar Albanian teenager, Adem(Adam). The humanity of individual Serbs and Roma(Gypsies), the ineffectiveness of several policies of the Democratic League of Kosova(LDK), the depictions of the city of Prizren and the nearby border with Albania, the views of Kosovar Albanians toward the then raging war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and the prediction of future intervention over Kosova/Kosovo by the United States, make this book unique, in that it was published before the open emergence of organized armed resistance in Kosova/Kosovo, let alone the start of involvement by NATO."
2,Misleading .. Read the ingredients,Very misleading. Thought this was all natural but when you read the small print it says it contains Ammonium Alum. I wanted all natural vegan. Very disappointed.
2,Does not control odor - dissapointed after use,"I work in an office and so my physical activity is not challenging. I used it three weeks and it grew steadily less effective. During week three I started experimenting. I tried applying once and repeating a few minutes later. I tried wiping myself w/ alcohol to kill bacteria that the salts are supposed to kill, then applying. I tried I tried scoring the surface to make sure enough salts were dissolving onto my skin. Nothing improved the results.I am using conventional deodorant again. My wife is happy w/ that. This is a really great concept, but it does not work."
2,Heavy and needs water to work,"Trew it to trash this morning. It needs watter to work, too heavy to carry around. I basically needed something to cary in my gym bag but this is not the product that woud work for this purpose."
1,pkm,I was disappointed to see the ingredients as ammonium alum while thenatural body deo are potassium alum. I dont know why they are making foolbut its a serious matter because there are still no studies to prove thatthis synthesized salt is safe to use.
2,Not exactly what i expected,The product is not as good as it is described. Maybe scent-free concept would have been good if the deodorant totally eliminated sweating. The result is that with the product you still sweat...
3,It worked - then it shattered,"The deodorant worked well for me. Getting it wet beforehand is a slight nuisance, but not a big deal.The problem is that the cylinder of salt is not attached at all to the plastic housing. It just pops right out if you tilt it too far. So, today, I was careless and didn't watch how far I was tilting my hand while using it and the whole cylinder of salt fell out and shattered on the floor. My wife already broke her salt cylinder a few weeks ago. I'm going to try the other brand next time, to see if they attach the salt cylinder to the plastic housing in some way."
5,Lasts at least 24 hours for me.,"I was very skeptical about this working when I bought it, but so far, I've been highly impressed. Even after 24 hours with me packing to move in between it kept all odor at bay. I admit that even after using it a couple weeks it still feels ""weird"" compared to traditional deodorant since it simply feels like you forgot to put any on at all. In the long run I think that would be a plus though.As has been said it's NOT an antiperspirant, so if you sweat a lot and are looking for something to help stop/impair that, this is not the product for you."
5,No More Nasty Chemicals - and Last For Years,"It can be hard to believe that something like this is very effective until you try it. Too different from conventional deodorants. You may have to moisten the tip a bit before applying it.Pros:- It really works.- Natural. Made from a certain type of mineral salts- One stick will last for years- Absolutely no scent- Non-staining & invisible- Not sticky at all.Cons:- Remember, this is a deodorant not an anti-perspirant"
2,"Long lasting item, poor odor preventative","I like that this item will last me for 2+ years, but I don't like the fact that it will randomly quit out on me. Maybe it's do to the changes of my work, but I can not find a way to keep this working more consistently for me throughout the day."
4,Good But you Have to PUT ALOT ON !!!!,This works Perfectly fine!! You wet it and rub it on. The problem for me is that I had to rub it on numerous times for it to work so Id sit their and rub for a couple minutes each morning (thats the reason for 4stars) Do not drop or break it either cause then its sharp and it hurts to put on. Besides that the product worked and was great!!
1,Does not work,Followed directions and applied liberally and does not work at all. I don't really sweat much either. What a waste of money.
3,Fast return.,"I received the product fast. The turning mechanism didn't work properly. When I twisted the lever, the deodorant slumped over. Maybe I happen to get a bad one, I don't know. It seems this twisting case is a cheaper quality compared to another brand I used. I was so irritated by this malfunction, I set this product under my sink as back up plan if I run low the other brand of crystal deodorant."
4,Works pretty well,"Works as advertised- there isn't anything glamorous about it. You don't smell for a while if you use this right when you get out of the shower. Sometimes I need to reapply, but not often. This can also be used to seal nicks from shaving."
4,"not EXCELLENT, but very good.","after reading a lot of reviews about this product, i decided to give it a shot. i have a mild case of acne and i have some blemishes. i've tried almost every product that there is over the counter, but none of them seemed to clear up my face completely. however, after using this cream for about a week, i started noticing some difference.my blemishes are almost not noticeable now, and my acne is clearing out. the only thing about this product i don't like is that it does get my skin dry, so i don't recommend it to people with sensitive skin.it is a SMALL jar, but you only need a light layer of it, so it lasts for a while now."
1,on a clear day h202,There is no experation date on the container but I think it may be expired because it has an odd texture and is really really thick.....I wouldn't buy anymore products from Amazon.
3,"some care a lot, others don't","Puttin' It Togetherthis CDR (made on demand) has been taken from an LP, and on track 2 (Sweet little Maia) are a few scratches.I had to cut them out with an editor.the music is great, print and package are ok.since this record doesn't seem to be available anymore (unless you pay a 100 bucks or more)still a good catch."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"It's really not worth your time. The first 1/4 of the book was stil decent; rather enjoyable, in fact. It did seem so very promising. But not even halfway through the book I guessed all the villians and knew how the plot was going to turn out. The fictional elements of El Dorado and the beasts were just too unbelievable. And you know it's just bad when Fantasy gets haphazardly combined with reality. As if the writer were writing some dort of fan fiction or plotless manga.But I would have to admit the narrative was a plus point, and there were parts that made me laugh out loud."
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read! That's saying somthing!,"Why can anyone not like this book?! I recived this book as a birthday present and kind of put in a corner not thinking it would be good, as I write this I hit my self on the head for this is one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made! So a week or so later I finished the book I was reading and was desparate to read somthing so I took this book out and began to read. The first 40 pages were slightly boring so I once again put in the corner. Finaly I began to read it and was engulfed, I unfortly was forced to eat and go somwhere once again delaying the process of reading this book. One might imagin that I read and then stoped again, but no I read ad read and read untill I was finished and than I dreamed and thought about it long after I was into another book. So if you are looking for a book you can stop and start this is not for you because once your in you are not coming out intill the end."
2,mmmmmm,"Yet another Cross over book for both adults and children to enjoy. This one, however, is mediocre. It has no real insight, terrible prose (maybe this is the translator's fault) flimsy spirituality, and is just plain boring. I expected better from Allende but maybe she should stay away from children's books. Two adult/children's books that are good however are Sabriel and Summerland (Michael Chabon).A book i highly recommend is The Beguilers by Kate Thompson. Beautifully written, full of emotion and insights into growing up and becoming an independent person, it is one of the best children's books i've ever read."
1,not worth even picking up,"For an author of Allende's caliber, this is a major disappointment.No sense of place or person. 100 pages into it and there was not one character with whom I could identify or care about. The professor is an unbelievably cliched stereotype. The environmental message is painfully obvious and annoying. The earlier reviewer correctly hit all the reasons NOT to waste your time on this book.I DON'T recommend this to any Harry Potter fans, instead suggest Lloyd ALexander, Brian Jacques, Garth Nix, Philip Pullman, Susan Cooper, or Tamara Pierce, to name a few."
2,disappointing,"Allende is one of my favorite authors; lyrical and intriguing. This book was neither. Although intended for junior audiences and the story premise was promising; the end result disappointing. There was no passion in the tale, none of the beautiful literary images she does so well. I found myself bored almost immediately. If I wanted to encourage young readers to read more this is not the book to select."
4,I really liked it,"This is an unusual book- hence the divided opinions, I guess. I held off judgement and just kept reading, and when I finished, I was so glad I had done so. I really liked the mix of science and paranormal events, because I believe that we need both in order to make the most of our lives. The descriptions of the Amazon were amazing. I enjoyed the characters, and the story line kept me intrigued.I would not call this book a classic, but I was enriched, and felt that I had a better outlook on the world for having read it. I ordered it immediately for my personal bookshelf."
2,Dissapointing,"I wasn't expecting much when I picked up City of the Beasts. I was intrigued by the cover, and curious; but I have never read any of Isabel Allende's works before, and as such have nothing to compare it to.All that I could think about while reading this was how often she repeated herself, and how terrible the dialouge is at some places. The characterization leaves alot to be desired. The only really interesting character was, in my opinion, Borbora, Nadia's pet monkey."
1,Allende is no J.K. Rowling....,"I deeply respect allende but she really messed up with this one. To me, this is a vulgar attempt at a latinamerican Harry Potter-ish novel of adventure. You want to know what's even worse? There's a sequel out. I saw it and I couldn't believe it.I guess Allende acted like those rock stars that reach their peak and then think they can sell any garbage they put out....and sometimes do."
1,Do NOT read this book.,"Let me put it this way. I just cut the book in half with a saw, hoping that would improve it. In some ways, it actually did."
5,This book is great,"This is a really good book. It has action, magic, and, possibly best of all, talks through a 15-year-old's point of view. The book is focused, esciting, and has a good twist."
2,The second book was much better,"I read first El Reino del Dragon de Oro and I like that book very much, then I read this one and the first part is very good, but the second half of the book is just boring, when Alex and Nadia went with the natives and they want to make you feel that they live better than any civilization is just pathetic, and I won't tell anything about the ""invisible Nadia"" the last 100 pages could be written in 50 or less pages. If I read first this book I would never read the second one."
3,bad books happen to good writers...,"Well, I am a huge Isabel Allende fan but this was too much! And I read it in Spanish so you can stop blaming the translator... I can't even begin to explain how insulted I was (and on how many levels!) by the Omaira character. On top of that, the story is one sorry new-age cliché after another. I gave the book 3 stars because despite the omnipresent [stuff] we do get a few glimpses of Isabel Allende at her best. I don't know about the rest of you but I want the old Isabel back. PRONTO."
3,End is not as good as the beginning,The beginning was very good and hooked me in. But the middle had too much description and it became boring. The ending was better than the middle but not as good as the beginning.
3,A NEW DIRECTION IN A RIGHT WAY.,"Isabel Allende's ""City Of The Beasts"" it's an entertaining book about adventures a-la-Jones, Isabel Allendes master description and turn twisting writing still here but with a heart for the mystical and suspense. I won't describe the plot because is unfair to tell the whole story if your going to read it, wich I recommend, because first it's an entertaining book, second Allende's description's gave you the whole idea, like if you're watching a movie, third the characters are well define and every one has a part in the story, and the end is somehow what you expected but with some curious twists, in fact this is the most easy to follow book from Allende, it will satisfy your need for some chill-out reading afternoon, after this you can also follow up with The Kigdom of the Golden Dragon, with the same people from this book but in a different adventure in a differente place."
2,Disappointment....,"City of Beasts is a book that rockets off to a great beginning, a mediocre middle, and a plunging, just awful ending. In my opinion, it are the books like City of Beasts that disappoint me the most. I mean, you have a fantastic opening. GREAT! Keep going before you lose both the suspense and the momentum! However, the plot just keeps slowing down and twisting. By the time you reach the end, BAM the book finishs with a crash, and you end up with wasted money and time. I bet if Isabel Allende had spent a couple more months revising the ending, City of the Beasts would have been an A+ novel. But sadly, it isn't...."
3,"Maybe yes, maybe no.","I liked this book, and I didn't like this book. I didn't like this book because it was somewhat boring, and written quite simply, for the first half of the novel. It took a great deal for me to actually want to finish it, and I almost didn't. Some parts are very corny. However, I thought the concept was great and the main adventurous part towards the end was quite fascinating. The twists and turns were also quite clever. If Allende stayed away from lame endings and ideas, and could write to appeal to both teens and adults, this could be a great novel. But, alas, it's done, and it's been done okay. 2.5/5"
5,Fantastic read!,"Isabel Allende's new book for young adults is a marvelous story! The book is rich with magical imagery, while at the same time giving us insight about the everyday problems of growing up. Some reviewers suggest that the book is too long (Harry potter #4 was 700+ pages) or that the themes are too scary (have you looked at the life of todays teens?), but Allende lends her amazing story-telling abilities to show readers some of the realities that may be outside their mundane world. Alexander's journey is not just through the rain forest - it is the journey to manhood: with all the beauty and pain that such a journey intails.Isabell Allende is a master story-teller, and she doesn't disapoint in this new book. As you read you absolutely loose yourself in its pages, just as the protagonists seem to loose themselves in the dense growth of the ancient jungle. There is something for everyone in the pages of this magical tale of adventure. I highly reccomend it!"
2,Not a good gift.,"City of the Beasts is being marketed as a children's book, apparently because its leads are teenagers, it is heavy on educational passages about the jungle, and its green theme is preached rather than developed.However, it is not likely to appeal to young readers. The translation uses academic phrasing rather than natural. The characters do not grow through conflict, they just add on capabilities as needed, and the ending hands off the resolution to grownups."
1,Beastly Boring,"I found this book in Perugia, when I was desperate for new reading material in English (besides the copy of Dan Brown's hideous ANGELS AND DEMONS someone left in our hotel). Had it not been for the dearth of reading material, I would have never finished this book. I thought at first it was a problem of translation from Spanish to Italian, then Italian to English, but that was not it. This book is written for young people, but seems to assume young people are terminally stupid. Would not recommend this, even if you are out of reading material. Read your guide book again."
5,City of the Beasts Review,"City of the Beasts is about a boy who lives in California. He has to be sent to his grandmothers house in New York. When he gets there his grandmother has to go to the Amazon for a National Geographics expidition. Alex gets captured by a tribe of indians along with Nadia the daughter of the leader of the expidition. While they are in the Amazon they become friends. Throughout the book they need to learn to use their inner strength. They mostly learn to use the capabilities that they had never before seen in them. This is a great book because it is very adventurous, mysterious, and you never know whats coming up next.I recommend this book to people who like scince fiction thrillers."
1,This book should be in the fiction section,This book is full of biases and misrepresentations. The author has a political agenda and sees everything from this biased perspective. It is a piece of fiction and not worth one's time.
4,A man in the ivory tower,"Shoher correctly wrote about Chomsky,""Regardless of how misguided and idealistic are Chomsky's views, I deeply respect him as a voice of conscience, reminding us of morality where we prefer efficiency and of compassion where we pursue self-interest.""But for the balanced view, I suggest Samson Blinded: A Machiavellian Perspective on the Middle East Conflict."
1,Chomsky defends Arafat and others who kill innocent people,"This is not a book about what is right and wrong in the Middle East, it is a memoir about a self-hating Jew.He feels that Israel has human rights violations and military aggression. Far from it. There are militant Palestinian's whose mantra is to eliminate Israel. What are they to do? Sit and wait for the bombers to kill innocent citizens.Israel is the greatest ally has in the Middle East.But Chomsky would rather ignore that and focus on the secondary issues.If Chomsky could get over his hatred of Judaism, he may be able to open his mind to the truth."
4,An incredible analysis of US policy towards Israel-Palestine,"Chomsky does an excellent job of presenting the flip (out of the mainstream media) side to this delicate issue. His analysis of US policy towards Israel over the decades since 1948 is both fascinating and insightful. Although it covers the issue only to the early 1980's, this is an excellent text for anyone who is trying to better understand the factors that forged the current US-Israeli-Palestinian relationship."
5,Call it a treaty on moral decadence,"The main idea on this book is that Israelis and its supporters have descended in a downward moral spiral, as they perpetrated or turned a blind eye to ethnic cleansing, human rights abuses against Palestineans in the occupied territories.After you read this book, you will find yourself really bothered everytime you read in the mainstream press that ""Israel is a democracy"" or other platitudes repeated ad nauseam by apologists of Israel's apartheid regime or Arab-haters.The only silver lining is that eventually oppression ends. It happened before in South Africa. The Soviet Union is gone. Soon Israel's occupation may even end. Or perhaps that is just a dream?"
4,Interesting,It was very interesting to read such a different perspective on the middle east. I would read another book by Norm Chomsky
1,More preaching and entertainment than information,"This book is intellectually dishonest. The author has a point of view and goes through great lengths to edit facts to get to a conclusion. This is a book that is great for learning a way of thinking, an agenda, but not a good book to get to facts. If you can see the difference than this will be an interesting read."
1,A ONE-SIDED DIATRIBE,"Not meant for folks who want a balanced and serious retrospective on the relationship between the 3 peoples. Chomsky and Said both have serious Pro-Palestinian agendas, and their academic credentials are widely known to be lacking serious content. Great Palestinian fluff piece, if that's what you're looking for. Extremely disappointing."
5,American especially should read this book,"If you are comfortable with American foreign policy in the Middle East, this book offers a great opportunity to test your comfort. For some the most difficult part about reading something like this will be clearing their head of decades of US-Israeli bias in America's press and popular culture. Remind yourself that it really is ok to consider opposing views and then see for yourself if you still like the way the United States coddles and manipulates Israel's violent self-interest for its own gains.You will find excellent resources for further study and consideration, including updated discussion covering recent developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Sources are plentiful. Regardless of where you ultimately land on this debate, the book is well-documented and useful."
4,"Good primer, not fun to read","A very interesting analysis of the conflict, though a bit one-sided (which is somewhat justifiable). Chomsky, as always is very dry and boring which is why this book will probably take you awhile to read. Nevertheless, it is a good primer on the conflict written by a highly controversial and well-known intellectual."
2,Monkey of Terror,"I have not been very impressed with any of the 'Baby Einstein' products I have seen, and this monkey is no exception. My daughter received this toy as a Christmas present, at six months old. She couldn't quite decide if she liked it or was afraid of it, but eventually came down on the side of being afraid. I can't even sing ""Head Shoulders Knees and Toes"" now without making her cry. Even if this monkey didn't scare the pants off my daughter, I think that it is not the best quality toy, and certainly the idea that a child is going to learn any more from it than from an engaged parent is a lot of marketing hoo-ha."
1,I want my money back!,"One word comes to mind--disgust! This book was poorly written and organized. The maps are microscopic and the walk-throughs are so simplistic as to be condescending. Aren't walk-throughs supposed to be just that--walk throughs? (If it looks like a teleporter, and smells like a teleporter, then it probably is!) The obvioius does not need to be spelled out for me!Not to mention what little information that _is_ included is incorrect! The author obviously is not a gamer, nor has he played this game. There are no charts to quickly guide you to your destination, nothing to cross reference and the maps are utterly worthless. They should have stuck to the M&M 6 format! Don't bother buying the book--just get what you need online."
3,Disappointing if compared to their M&M VI hint book,"I've been a Might & Magic fan since the first of the series. Geez, that really dates me. This hint book was deficient in several ways compared to the M&M VI hint book.There wasn't a chart showing the locations and requirements to upgrade the various skills of your players. You had to root through the listings of every single map to try to find them. I found an online FAQ that was very helpful though.The maps were often too small with locations listed on the back of the page. A minor point but the M&M VI book had all the maps together and they used the whole page. It also had the locations listed on that page with a line directly to the spot.All in all it is helpful but a better job could've been done to make it more useful. Did I say that the M&M VI was better done?"
2,"badly organized, incomplete","The back says ""In-depth walkthroughs of every quest"", but a quick examination reveals that they don't even include information on where to find a couple of the class promotion quests, which are very important. Also, they've organized everything around the regions instead of around the quests, which makes it difficult to find the info you want without accidentally seeing stuff about quests that happen in the same region, but much later in the game.It's an OK book, and does cover the things that are likely to have you stuck, but the MM6 book was superior in many ways."
3,Just OK,"I expected the quality of M&M IV and didn't get it. The layout and artwork have really been worked on but the organization is terrible. Who wants to flip pages in the middle of a game? The only real improvement I have noticed is that there is an arrow which indicates small areas on the map to help find Skills, Shops etc. And the walkthroughs in M&M VI were very good."
1,Second-worst strategy guide I've ever read!,"I'd give it first-worst but frankly it does not deserve first-anything. It IS essential, if only because the manual is so deficient, but that's the best I can say. I've spent almost as much time searching through the guide as I have playing the game. Surely Prima can do better than this."
4,thanx,"with a glut of garbage games being made now, i still like playing my old games, and this book, in fine condition makes the game run much smoother. many detailed maps and info on characters, weapons, armor, and etc. helps."
3,More underwritten than underground.,"Thought this might be one of those underground cult gems, but it's just a sad little tale of a wanna-be who strings some schmuck along, and ends up no where herself. Actually too realistic. Really a downer. I prefer when the characters rise above their faults, even if they don't succeed. These folks just allow them selfs to be swallowed up by the circumstances of their lazy lives."
1,HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS ITEM IN MY MAIL BOX,"I remeber reviewing this to buy, but it's never showed up here.Will check further on this item =As it would be in my Woodworing Shop on it's arrival - maybe it was out of stock - but will certianly check it out asap."
2,Misleading Description,"The Delta product description is ambiguous. It is simply marked ""Right""(or ""Left""). Does ""Right"" mean the tape reads from ""Right to Left"" of ""To the Right""? You guess. There is no elaboration in the Amazon product description. You have to buy it and return it to find out. I got what I wanted from Lee Valley tools. They describe their products adequately."
2,"Good songs, really bad mixing","The tracks on this cd are pretty dope. He managed to throw in some nice techno(e.g. the Joel Mull) into this cd, but his mixing is really really off point. I would think that on a cd one shouldn't have to hear the dj correcting his mixes, and at some points there are trainwrecks, not serious ones, but very noticeable ones. And another thing, he mixes every single song exactly the same way which I find gets annoying to listen to."
3,last time w this seller,The book arrived within time ( two weeks period ) but it was before the period finish by two days and for me it is considered late because I have school .I dont think that I am going to deal w this seller again .I tried two other books from bookbyte and the timing was very perfect .
5,Salt free,"If you are on a low salt diet this is the chili powder you should probably be using. I'm no gourmet, but it makes good chili. I ran across it a couple years ago in a chili recipe that had won a prize in a contest that wasn't for low salt chili. So it probably tastes as good to others as it does to me.I haven't seen another chili powder without salt. And I haven't run across this one locally. Since you have to order online, it isn't an imposition to have to get 24 packs and just stock up if you are a chili fancier."
4,A-Z Complete!,"This is a great book to have. This guide has every character, place and event from The Hobbit, LoTR and The Silmarillion. If your really into Tolkien, you need this."
4,one error,"at page 565, Aragorn 2 (Elessar), who married to Arwen and one of the fellowship, is misspelled as Arathorn 2."
2,You need to be a tolkien head to understand the explanations,"Somehow, I was always of the opinion that an explanation was supposed to make things EASIER to understand. Many of Foster's explanations only seem to make things murkier. Witness the first sentence of his description of Sauron: ""Ainu, one of the Maiar of Aule."" Now, if that explanation means anything to you, you probably don't need the Complete Guide. For the rest of us people who get out sometimes, this explanation is useless. Admittedly, the explanation picks up after a bit, but why force me to wade through a paragraph of gibberish to find out what I need to know. Why not just tell me that Sauron is some really bad guy or something, you know, English. But then again, if he wrote that way, Foster couldn't impress you with his Tolkien Fluency.Don't impress me. Just tell me what I need to know.Otherwise, a somewhat useful book."
5,The only complete and accurate encyclopedia,"In an age when readers habitually turn to the Web for reference guides, it's useful to remember that the =only= complete and accurate encyclopedia of Tolkien's legendarium as published through =The Silmarillion= is a book, and to have it reprinted in this new edition. This is the first trade paperback of Foster's classic guide. Its page references have always been to the Ballantine paperbacks; new typesettings of =LotR= have given this edition three sets of page references, making it a bit hard to use. A cross-reference table to the old hardcovers is retained, but newer typesettings of the hardcovers are not mentioned. Or I think not: unless I missed it, the book doesn't actually say what editions the new page references are to. Still, Foster remains the most essential book about Tolkien's world by someone other than Tolkien himself."
3,Didn't realize it was LITERALLY A-Z,"I was expecting a book that summarized ""everything you wanted to know about middle earth but were afraid to ask"". What it turned out to be was an encyclopedia of ME, which is probably what it should have been named. It's complete & well done, so I'm not marking it down for being poor quality or anything. It's just not in any way readable, more like an encyclopedia that you could refer to if you were reading the books or watching the movies, and had a question like ""Where's Morgoth??""."
5,An Indispensable Reference For The Tolkien Fan,"As otherwise comprehensive as the appendices at the end of The Lord Of The Rings are, Professor Tolkien seems to have forgotten (or not to have had time to include) one important thing: a glossary. Fortunately, Robert Foster has come to our rescue with his wonderful Complete Guide To Middle-Earth.Tolkien has created an incredibly complex world in his Middle-Earth books; a world in which it's almost impossible not to (at least occasionally) get lost. Can't quite remember who the Numenoreans were? What the Eldar were? Where Thangorodrim was? Here's the book for you.Highly recommended to Tolkien fans both new and old."
5,The Greatest!,This is a must have for all Tolkien Fans. It has everything you need to know about characters and places to make you a Middle Earth expert!
4,The Way to Read and Understand Tolkien,"Reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy with this book next to me was a whole new experience. There are hundreds of incredibly subtle references that you can shed new light on, and a wealth of background information on every character and culture to be found in the guide. The reason it does not get 5 stars is this: This book is abridged from a similar book released in the 1970's. The older version contains more, unofficial information from various other sources. I was able to find that at an antique store by a stroke of luck, and I found that it was even more helpful, it even had maps showing troop movement at the Battle of Pelennor Fields. So if you find the old version, get that, but if you can't this is well worth it!"
5,Extremely helpful guide to the world of Middle-Earth,"This is basically a glossary and appendix for many of Tolkiens writings. While reading the Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, or The Simarillon, you should keep this wonderfully handy book by your sides. Due to the complexities of Tolkien's works, a reader will sometimes find themselves wondering who certain characters mentioned are. If you have any questions you can simply look in Foster's brilliant sidekick guide. This is great for repeat readers of the magnificent fantasy. - Gandalf White-"
5,Only five stars? This book should get MORE!,"How can a real Tolkien 'Ringer' or even a beginner read Tolkien without this book? Every name, thing, place, etc. in the books. Background information. Explanations. Trivia. Etc. Etc. I keep my copy with me as I read. It helps keeps characters straight in your mind and expands on what you have just read in whatever Tolkien book you may be reading. Fills in gaps that make the reading much more fun! A must have!"
4,Great Book To Understand the Middel-earth World,This is a very well written though guide book for the Middel-earth world. I personally think that it's great for any one who wants to learn more about the world that Tolkien created. It answers a lot of questions that aren't difficult to understand.
4,Good... could be better.,"I agree with others that the definitions aren't often that clear and require that you know the character/item ahead of time. But there are a few areas of improvement that would really make this book shine:-Including guide words on the top of pages would make finding terms easier.-The genealogical charts at the end are full of errors - mostly typographical - including obvious ones such as switching the names ""Aragorn II"" and ""Arathorn II"".-Maps would make geographical descriptions so much easier. They may have not been included for other reasons, but would make this truly a superb reference.In conclusion, this book may be misleading in its appeal and not be so well suited to the casual reader. It may also spoil some events you have not yet read if you are reading Tolkien for the first time. It is great for that occasional (aka frequent) confusion though. It is a useful reference and with a good edit would be vastly more excellent and accurate."
1,UGh,I read this book over the summer in the course of researching Grace O'Malley and was rolling my eyes the whole time. Why take a fascinating historical figure and turn her life story into a boring romance novel? I don't understand.I was also unable to finish the book despite my usual fascination with anything related to Queen Elizabeth or female pirates. Bleaugh.
2,Nothing more than a romance novel,This book is nothing more than a romance novel with some historical names & dates. I was hoping for a more thoughtful historical novel about Grace O'Malley's life but was disappointed to read what lay before me. I'll try another book for a more accurate & true picture of the life of Grace O'Malley.
4,GREAT EXTRA LONG LOAF PAN,THIS LOAF PAN IS GREAT FOR ANY POUND CAKE AND GIVES YOU SUCH NICE NEAT SLICES.WOULD HAVE LIKED FOR THE PAN TO HAVE BEEN A LITTLE HEAVIER.I HAVE BAKED ALL KINDS OF CAKES IN THIS PAN BESIDES POUND CAKES WITH GREAT SATISFACTION.
5,Just not as wide as I imagined,My goal was to bake a long loaf of sandwich bread. While it gives ample height...it just isn't as wide as commercial bought bread. Still.... It's a great product for longer bread
5,Awesome bread pan,"Bought and used the loaf pan to make bread. It baked the bread evenly, browned nicely, and came out smooth. Easy to clean."
1,Wilton Aluminum 16 by 4 by 4-1/2-Inch Long Loaf Pan / purchased at amazon,It was well beyond the date it should have arrived / Although inexpensive it is not sturdy bends easy / I do a lot of cooking & would not recommend this product.
4,wanted a big loaf pan this is it,barely fits oven but this is the one if you make standard loaves rather than short ones .I make a lot of homemade bread in it when we want sandwitch style loaves.
5,wilton aluminum bread pan,This pan is AWESOME!!!! Makes bread perfectly everytime.I bought two pans so far and I'm thinking of buying another one.
3,...meh,"Product delivered as promised, but was all stuck together & extremely difficult to separate the pans from one another. Also, disappointed in the cheap material the pans are made from. Had I seen the quality of the item in a store I certainly would not have purchased, unless the price was significantly lower."
5,i'm with trejo; get this book,"When I read the trejo review of this book I thought ""no way"" it could be that good. I WAS WRONG; TREJO WAS RIGHT. First comment: you'll have to get used to the language-game of the author. Give yourself 30 pages or so to warm up; he's difficult at times. Having said that; BUY THIS BOOK. This is more than a presentation of the Hegelian right. It is a fantastic text for ""hermeneutics"", if you happen to be teaching that class. It is primarily a grad-level or post-grad-level book; but with good lecture you could use it in undergrad. He respects jurgen moltmann which is also another big plus. Pages 30-140 should be read by all Hegelian students. Those pages alone are worth the price of the book. Thanks to trejo for the recommendation. I loved it."
5,Extremely important,"This is one of several crucially important books to be read today. Here's why: our planet is in the midst of a major extinction of life, and it is caused by humans. Governments and corporations are doing very little to stop it. The Nature Conservancy is devoted to preserving land and biological communities, which is one of the few hopeful directions we are taking. Birchard's book about the leaders of this amazing organization will hopefully inspire the reader to contribute in some way to the saving of our precious earth."
4,Great Book for NGO Management,"""Nature's Keepers"" is an important and well crafted book. For a young person in the non-profit community, the book has been extremely valuable, as I watch, contemplate, and participate in my own organization's thinking on strategy, management, and governance. I have recommended it to many of my colleagues."
4,Just what I wanted,This was recommended by someone from the village of Noatak where I live. It is nice because it has people from the village and surrounding area and gives a good indication of the mindset and history of this area. Well worth the price.
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!,"Don't buy it! This is the worst dishwasher I have ever used. You absolutely *must* wash your dishes before loading as it will not get them clean. It doess't dry, either. Water all over all the dishes is very common. I have to use Jet Dry, which does help, but it's still not acceptable.Also, with no handle, it can be hard to move.The electrical cord does not go in or out easily.The inside walls around the door get filthy. It's scary because the dirt is there but doesn't get washed when you run a load. I always have to clean it. Gross.I really regret purchasing this dishwasher.This morning the inside plastic wall cracked. How, I don't know. It's only about two years old."
4,A nice holiday read,"Yes, I agree with the other reviewer--I, too, found this a fun, romantic read and full of holiday spirit. My only complaint is that the heroine was a bit too precocious for an 18 year old at one time, and a bit too naive at other time. She had a good heart and passionate for some charity works, but she also presented as an impetuous and yet a non-practical young lady. Not quite my kind of heroine, but everything else was pretty well done."
2,could be knit-picking but...,"Listened to this book recently and couldn't believe the gaps in police procedure! I kept wondering when the test results would be mentioned. Fingerprinting per-chance? DNA? Paternity test? Did I miss something?Those distractions, and a ridiculous description of a person taking Prozac made me feel like the author didn't have time for research or accuracy. I finished the book, so I was interested enough to find out what happened."
3,OK Courtroom Story with Weak Beginning,I am more into police and PI books than courtroom drama but this is OK. There is a lot of the hero dealing with his inner demons which doesn't add much. The first 50-55 pages are useless. Setting the scene could have been done just as well in five pages and saved everyone some time. Once the story gets rolling it is OK. I liked the fact that even though the defendant isn't guilty he is still scum so it is not a matter of a poor downtrodden innocent getting jobbed by the system. My wife bought this as part of a box of books for five dollars from our local library so there was no real investment involved. I was ready to quit early on but in the end the plot was fine.
4,The Disappearance,"I really hate to read most mass market books because they are so predictable. This one isn't. He kept me guessing down to the end. Even though the plot does seem to ""thicken"" a little more than necessary the author uses our curiosity to pull us through this very good novel. I would recommend this book without hesitation."
2,Good soul searching story bad case,"The interpersonal story in this novel of the lawyer Luke is a touching one. His struggle as he renters the world that he left after his divorce is a powerful story. The scenes where he confronts people he once knew in his old life are well written. They are written in such a way that the reader understands Luke's struggle, very few writers can write like that.The problem with this novel, however, is that the bulk of the novel is about the case Luke takes on. This part of the novel is non belivable. There are to many holes in the story and the conclusion of this tale is rushed and less belivable than the rest of the story.On the whole I would not recomend this book the good scenes with Luke are outweighed by a dull unbelivable court case."
4,"""Who done it?""",Freedman is a page-turner! A teenager's mysterious death puts a powerful family in the spotlight and the pressure mounts until the surprising finale..You won't be able to put it down. Enjoy!
3,A Really Good Ride to a So-So Ending,"As a reader of mostly true crime, I only read mystery fiction if it's fast moving and fun. This was both (even though I wished his hero hadn't had that stupid pony tail). The characters were engaging enough to keep me turning page after page. Trouble was - the ending. Too trite. Just too pat for my taste. I don't know exactly how the author could have made it better, but I wish he'd tried. Anyone who can write like that has a better imagination than the one he showed me."
4,An excellent legal thriller,"If you enjoy legal thrillers, you will love this book. This is the third and by far the best book I've read by J. F. Freedman (Key Witness and Above the Law were the other two). Luke Garrison, a former star district attorney haunted by his past, is persuaded to come out of semi-retirement to take on a seemingly unwinnable case of a TV news anchor accused of kidnapping and murdering his boss's 14-year-old daughter. The client, the victim, and the victim's family all have secrets somebody will go to any length to keep hidden. All the ""genre"" elements are present as Luke takes on his personal demons and unravels the state's case against his client, but the interesting characters, well-thought-out plot, and crisp writing keep it from seeming cliched. The story moves along briskly, with lots of plot twists that cast suspicion on each of the major players in turn, keeping you guessing until the end. A thoroughly enjoyable page-turner."
2,Too formulaic to really grip,"Freedman writes better than most of his rivals - especially the legal thriller authors, many of whom rarely rise above cardboard where the characters are concerned - but I found I could see where this story was going to easily to fast. Why? Because I could sense the author setting up his 'surprises'. They don't spring lifelike from the grain of what the story is about. They're simply assembled - albeit quite well."
5,"A ""couldn't put it down"" book!","""The Disappearance"" held my interest from start to finish. Nothing was predictable, yet neither was any of it unbelievable. This, in my opinion, is the true mark of a great ""who dunnit."" I ""happened"" upon this book and can't wait to read Freedman's other books. I would suggest that the many readers who read Grisham's latest book and thought it was pretty terrible - as I did - give Freedman a try. ""The Disappearance"" is a much better read than even the best of Grisham."
2,Boring and predictable,"This should be called ""The Disappointment"". The first hundred pages are well done. But as soon as the protagonist shows up the story loses momentum. For more than 200 pages there is just repetetive dialogue. It gets a little better when the trial begins. But any experienced reader knows after the first chapters who did it."
2,Carbide edges chipped during shipping,"I am sure this is a great router bit set, but the bits were not properly secured in the box during shipping - which caused them to shake loose and rattle around inside the box. By the time the package was delivered the carbide edges were severely chipped, which made the bits useless. The picture of the bit set on Amazon did not show the type of box that was included with the set. Refer to Freud's website for an actual picture of the set. The picture on the Amazon product page shows a box that looks like it actually would secure the bits pretty good during shipping, but unfortunately that is not the box that is included with the set. Needless to say, I returned the set to Amazon."
3,Plagued by bad sound quality,The main problem with this CD is that it comes up short in sound quality. While some songs sound great others sound as if recorded a very long time ago or being recorded in bad sound studios. This is absolutely unacceptable when Putumayo has such a wealth of similar titles with incredible quality. For me the best song was #5 because of this funky harp that is played excellently and thankfully the sound was good. I will have to recommend the Putumayo releases Afrolatino and Afro-latin Party before this one.I really cannot understand the 5 star reviews below in light of the sound quality.
5,Cowboy Country At It's Best,"I first enjoyed this album nearly 20 years ago. It's a great collection of 'country-traditional-western-cowboy-songs' and the stand-out track is Paniolo Country. Randy's vocals were in fine form and this Warner Bros release accompanied a movie with Chuck Norris and Burt Reynolds of the same name.Other notable tracks include the haunting title track, about the darker side of cowboy life. The stirring vocals, as Randy sings 'Beyond the campfire light, through the stillness of the night, came the call of the coyote choir, and the song of the wind in the wire'.The album also covers Bob Wills territory with several Texas Swing numbers that include the excellent Roamin' Wyomin' and Cowboy Boogie with it's fabulous foot-warming chorus.As a side note, this is also one of the finest album cover shots of Randy!You won't hear this style of country on the radio anymore, making it an extra special item to own."
2,Watch,"The watch I got was good but, there was one thing about it that I didn't like, the strap on the watch (the one that keeps the watch on your wrist) is VERY fat this watch would get 5 stars by me if it had a thinner strap."
2,Not What is in the Picture,"I ordered this awhile ago. When I received it, it was not the Goku pictured. It was Goku in Saiyan armor and was a Jakks Pacifics toy, not Irwin Toys. Its a good toy, just not what I wanted."
5,WOW,"This was suggested by Amazon based on a purchase of stuff by Owen Pallet who I heard interviewed on the Vinal Cafe. It was nothing like I expected and I need more.....it (like Arcade Fire and Owen Pallet's Final Fantasy; although I am not sure it is normal for people my age to love this stuff) has opened up a whole genre of music that has gotten my entire head involved, not just my ears. I am 54 and I have a renewed passion for music. ""Wicked fun"", again."
3,Repetitious recycling of some important work,"Herdt has spilled millions of word about pederastic initiation among the people he has called the Sambia. Anyone but a hardcore, masochistic anthropologist would do better to read his Holt book _The Sambia_ than this minimally edited, highly repetitious recycling of some of his journal articles. The introduction is particularly opaque and unhelpful. Herdt is a recovering Freudian who takes a thousand words to say what could be said clearly in a sentence."
4,Classic Mothersday songs,"this is one of those cds that once you hear it, you will realize that it is a classic. There are many songs on this tribute to mothers day that are out of circulation and you wont find any where wlse. So if you see this cd some where by all means buy it you wont be let down."
2,Slow moving rotoscoped animation,"The storyline for this movie was interesting, but took so long to get moving I started to lose interest. If it was a one-hour movie, it probably would have been more entertaining. The Big Bad Evil Ice Guy is attempting to conquer the Good Guy Fire King, but most of the time is spent with the Fire King's scantily clad, fantasy-proportioned princess running from ape-like soldiers and being rescued over-and-over by a sole-surviving warrior from one of her father/king's tribes. It all wraps up very quickly in the end. If you like Frazzetta, then you'll notice this is a whole movie of his paintings in rotoscoped animation."
5,Finally on DVD!!,"I have an old, worn out copy of this film on VHS and I bought this yesterday. Finally, this great, gritty and violent animated film has been put on DVD. Nobody paid this movie much attention when it first came out, which is not surprising since this film was way ahead of its time.Even better: the second disc loaded with special features.Well worth the money."
5,Frazetta!,"Foe American anime this is great! Much better than Wizards or the heavy Metal toons. Of course you have to like Frazettas voluptuous females and over muscled dudes, but what ever. It is well done and entertaining and shows that America can give good anime! Hah!"
2,Could have been better.,"I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and loved it. When it was released on to VHS I was probably one of the first people to buy it. Loved it still. Finally, i got off my wallet and bought it on DVD thinking it was going to be a great entertainment investment. Sadly, my VHS copy looks better. the producers didnt digitally remaster a single cell in this version. I'm not asking to remake it in CGI or anything, but cleaning it up a bit would have been nice."
4,Good fun,Brings back memories from England in 1983. I was stationed there temporarily and watched it with my mates. Was cool back then and still is today.
4,Frazetta paintings brought to life,"FIRE AND ICE is an adventure fantasy in the vein of Sword & Sorcery paperbacks of the seventies--particularly the ones with Frazetta covers, as Frazetta provided the character designs and informed the overall look of the world.The script, which is fairly stock pulp fantasy fare, is provided by veteran comics writers Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, who had a lot of experience with this sort of thing from Marvel's Conan series. The animation is good for the era, but of course, it's over twenty years old and pre-computer animation. Certainly the rotoscoping provides a versimilitude of motion that will surprise those that only remember TV cartoons from the era.Overall, for fans of adventure fantasy, particularly in the comic book vein, Fire and Ice is highly enjoyable, if not particularly deep, and a testament to what interesting things here being done in the fringes in the days when film animation was virtually synonymous with Disney in the American mind."
4,Interesting Little Video,"This film was created almost thirty years ago and I had not known about it until recently. It's not a blockbuster but it is a nice diversion and fun to watch on a rainy day.It is animated of course although the characters are rotoscoped (real actors which are painted over on the film) so it is pretty fluid. The people are scantily clad especially the heroine who is in a thong bikini almost the entire length of the DVD. The hero wears something that covers just a little more but not much more. Some people are offended for whatever reason so I'm stating it.As for me, it's a good addition to my collection where I'll probably watch it again when I need a light escape from the world."
5,Return to Paradise,Upon purchasing a condo in Florida I discovered one of my neighbors to be one of the stars in the film. I thought that it would be great to buy it if possible. My first thing is to search Amazon.com. They had the film on DVD and it was bought. It was a delightful film and more special knowing one of the stars.
2,It's an ok book...,"...But NOT for beginner artists:SThe book itself is pretty cool with lots of characters and pretty pictures to look at. That alone, is ALOT of inspiration:)BUT.... And this is the bad part about the book... I'm not learning much from it:( There are very little hints on HOW to actually draw something. I'm not advanced enough for this book as i need step-by-step guides, wich this book does not contain much of. Sadly:(It's probably a really great book for the more advanced artists, but i cannot recomend this book for beginner artists like myself... I'm sorry. I also cannot recomend any other books as i haven't bought that many yet. But by all means, if you really WANT this book, the pictures in it makes it worth buying:) Inspiration is also an important part on your way to becoming a master artist:) And besides, the more people who buy it, the bigger the chances gets for a follow-up book:) Wich will probably be better for us non-professionals:p"
3,NOT A MUST BUT NOT TOOOO BAD...,"This general introduction to ancient Egyptian civilization certainly is much out-dated, much-neglected and much-criticized, perhaps as an extension of the criticism that her book on ""The God of Witches"" had received in 1921 up-to-day. None the less, I must confess that it has been very useful to me as a mind-opener and as a font of inspiring thoughts for further researches. So that I dare to recommend it as an optional title for your bookshelves. There are some unusual illustrations and photographs, which are worthy as to justify the expenses."
5,Genius!,"This is not your typical Peter Gabriel CD, but then again what is? Peter has written and produced every song on this CD. The catch is that he has other artists singing most of the lead vocals. Richie Havens, Paul Buchanan and Elizabeth Fraser sing lead vocals on most of the tracks. The three are full of talent and bring great emotion to these wonderful songs. Peter has lead vocals on two tracks, including the touching ""Father and Son"" and the rocking ""The Tower That Ate People"" He shares lead vocals with the other three on the wonderful 10 minute epic ""Make Tommorow"" which closes out the album. Each song gets better each time you listen, the Peter Gabriel ""vibe"" is there throughout the CD. Peter plays many instruments on each track and is joined several times by his usual bandmates:Tony Levin, David Rhodes and Manu Katche. The lyrics and the music combine to make a must-have CD! The CD is pricey because it's an import, but if you're a Peter Gabriel fan, you must buy this CD!"
2,For Lightfoot fans ONLY!,"Gordon Lightfoot described his performance in this film as ""I'm so awful, I'm good!"" He underestamated himself. Granted he wasn't given a good script to work with but his performance is one of the few highlights of ""Harry Tracy"". (His rare song one the soundtrack was another.) Other than that no reason to forfeit two hours of life on this watered-down Sam Peckinpah/ Butch-n-Sundance wannabe!"
2,So so,"A cheap one, yes, I know, but still have to say that the remote has to be very near the signal receiver to use it, so that makes it kind of ineffective from some angles."
4,Equal focus on trio interplay,"This Haitink/Beaux Arts/LPO Triple Concerto is superb and also unique in my experience. The acousticcaptures the BA Trio so closely that one can hear their playing in minute detail. At the same time, the orchestral playing is equally detailed and attractively unbloated. The BA plays the concerto from a chamber music perspective more than a triple superstar perspective. Nothing drags and thebouyancy helps. Pressler and Greenhouse are especially eloquent. Both play with beautiful tone. Try the cello intro to the second movement and both in the polacca section of the third movement. However, Isidore Cohen sounds a bit scrawny/anemic at times. On the whole the trio playing isaddictive. This performance faces major competition from Serkin/Laredo/Parnas/Schneider/Sony and Demus/Jochum/VSO/Tacet (see the review of the Tacet). The Beethoven Variations are totallycaptivating and beautifully played. Highly recommended with the single reservation."
5,Afloat,"As a sailor I read this little book like reading a yacht's log book. The device is fresh and alive. Much of how he wrote it captures the feeling of being with him on that yacht with the wind taking Guy, you and a wide range of thoughts anywhere on a whim. You are always brought back to the ""Bel-Ami"" itself to move forward-book as yacht. It has been said that to understand the French you had to read Guy de Maupassant. Well, to understand the spirit of the sailing life it doesn't hurt to read him either. Delightful."
1,Poor quality,"Very Nice Looking shirt,...looks can be deceiving. Wore it once and the dye started to bleed. I followed the label's directions and now there are black marks all over the white bits. Live and learn."
4,Electronic Goodies,"This album will please all the Daft Punk fans who have been disappointed with their last effort, Human After All. The Looks is fueled by high tempo, catchy and groovy melodies every house fanatics has been craving for the last few years. MSTRKRFT is simply brilliant when it comes to create multi-layered dancefloor tracks reminiscent of the Best of French House, melody driven, bass pumping with insane rythms.The highlights on this album are 'Monster Hospital' and 'Paris!', and the only thing wrong with this album is its length: way, way too short.Party people, this one is for you."
4,There's Something About Jonathan,"I used to drive bye the Stop'n'Shop with the radio on. Didn't you? Massachusetts when it's late at night and the neon on when it's cold outside.I say listen to it once, listen to it twice, add it to your library and you will feel so nice.You'll have the Jo-jo <jonathan on...>There's just something about Jonathan Richman ;-)"
5,FANTASTIC,"This CD blew me away. I'd known that Indecision was a good band for a long time and I enjoyed their more recent 7inch work, but Unorthodox is one of the best records of the 90s. The vocalist here, Tom, is actually better (I think) than Artie. This record is definitely one of the more unique and memorable hardcore offerings; no generic, flat songs here. Full of memorable lyrics. After you hear this, you'll only want to hear it again, and again, and so on. Best of all is 83 tracks featuring the band members and various people talking about anything and everything while on tour, laying around at home, etc. including a very interesting grind/death joke song towards the end. You WILL enjoy this."
3,haha!,"I heard this back inna day when I was in high school ditching all the time! Funny,commercially-freindly ode to lsd."
1,Poor quality mastering,"The engineer must have been asleep at the mixing board, because the sound level of this disc is so low, I had to boost the Largo movement 11dB and still can barely hear it. Ripped it several times thinking something went wrong, but it is just a bad level on the disc. Buy someone else's version...Can't comment on the performance, because I can't hear it!"
3,Not her best mystery...,"I'm a big fan of Hercule Poirot's mysteries. I agree with otherreviewers, though, that this book does not reflect Ms. Christie'susual style. In fact, I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as her other Poirot novels, so if any of you haven't read Agatha Christie books before, DO NOT start with this one. Get Five Little Pigs instead. By the way, to another reviewer, Hastings meets his wife to be in Murder on the Links. Anyway, read Big Four after you've read more of Christie's books."
2,Agatha Christie Falters,"Agatha Christie was out of her element in the spy thriller, The Big Four, in which the villains are fomenting nothing short of world wide conquest. And moving Hercule Poirot away from country houses was not a good idea as he traipses uncharateristically all over the continent. His famous gray cells seem a little slow as well as all the puzzles set before him will be readily apparent to the reader long before the famous detective figures it out. The saving grave of this otherwise dismal entry into the Poirot library is the return of Hastings and the development of the relationship between Poirot and himself. A mystery to be skipped except for the die hard Christie fans."
2,Definitely not Christie's best - possibly her worst,"I love, love, love Agatha Christie. When I read the back cover of ""The Big Four"", though, I became a little skeptical about how she could cover such world intrigue with huge characters in such a short book.I should have listened to my instincts. This book seems as if A) she was in a hurry to get something out on a deadline, or B) it was written by someone else entirely.It was choppy, predictable, pointless, and very far-fetched. I hope this is not the first Agatha Christie read for someone, because otherwise it will be their last, and they will forever wonder what the fuss is about her.I gave it two stars instead of one only because it's worth a read ONLY if you are trying to read her complete collection."
4,"Not the usual Christie book, but still fun to read","This book is totally different from Christie's other stories. In this tale, Poirot faces a secret society formed by four criminal minds that seek to take over the world.And the plot reminds a lot of a James Bond film. But Poirot has no guns or gadgets but his wits. The book has a racist touch, but then, so have many James Bond books and films. And this book was written at a time when the political situation of the world was a lot different.So, what's this book worth? I personally believe it is highly entertaining. The mysterious Number Four is an intriguing character, an assassin and master of disguise. We never get to see his features, not even after he has died. As the story unfolds we face Poirot's death, his ""return"" from the dead and Hastings torn apart his loyalty to his friend and his wife. And the ending is equal to the rest of the book: Unrealistic, yes, but still fun to read.I read this book almost twenty years ago and I still like it."
2,Who are you? And what have you done with my friend Hercule Poirot?,"This, Christie's 5th Poirot book (although it takes place earlier in time than the third,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, as this novel was earlier published as a series of stories), is by far the weakest to that point. Poirot is up against a conspiracy for world domination, and he runs around in disguises, with poisoned darts in his cigarettes and little bombs. It is not unusual for Poirot to - as he says - ""play the comedy,"" but much of this action feels out of character. And the ending is unsatisfying. The plan of the villains seems supremely inadequate.I found it entertaining enough, but any of these others are better: The Mysterious Affair At Styles, Murder on the Links, Poirot Investigates, the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, and Peril at End House (i.e., every other Poirot book I have read recently). Go there first."
1,Probably Christie's Worst,I usually like Agatha Christie books. This book seems as if it was written by a ghost writer. I do not recommend it at all.
4,I had mixed feelings...,"I am a huge fan of Agatha Chrisite and picked up this book out of interest. This plot seemed a bit unlike her. Usally she deals with low key murders in certain towns and cities but this one had to do with murders that could effect the entire world. I really did like the ending, the best part but I was unimpressed by the beginning and middle parts. I totally fell for the little ""trick""(if you've read the book you'll know what I mean). I think everyone who is a fan of hers should read this book just to complete your understanding of Ms. Chrisite but if you are a first time reader, I would suggest otherwise."
1,awful,"I am normally a huge fan of Agatha Christie's work, but this book is really awful. A ridiculous premise of a gang of 4 super-criminals out to conquer the world, silly plot twists, etc. Not her usual style at all. Read her ""drawing room"" mysteries instead."
3,Tongue-in-cheek,"I found this book really amusing. Christie had to have been laughing the whole time she was writing it. The plot can't possibly be taken seriously, but is fun to read. Just don't use this book as a gauge for her other books which are well worth reading."
3,More like 007 than Hercule Poirot,"Of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels, ""The Big Four"" is one of the easiest reads, probably due to the fact that it's really an action/adventure story rather than the usual mystery. The storytelling, for that is what it truly is, is simple and straight-forward. There are no real clues to follow as there is no real mystery: the evil-doers are revealed early in the narrative. All that's left is to hang on for the ride as Poirot and Hastings embark on an adventure worthy of a James Bond movie. If you're looking for entertainmet, you've found it. If it's a Poirot mystery you want, look elsewhere."
3,Square Peg in a Round Hole,"Agatha Christie is generally a truly excellent writer, but I think she made a mistake when she sent Poirot on this tale on international intrigue. The story seems to take place over too long a period of time, snaking all over the world in loosely linked (but well-solved) cases. Generally, Poirot goes better ""armchair detecting"", solving a local small mystery in a week or so. The plot seemed a little too snaky, and the ending seemed forced and a little awkward. Perhaps a little more backstory, especially with Countess Vera Rossakoff, would improve this one. I also got rather tired of hearing about vile Oriental fiends, which seemed to feature prominently in the story, even for 1930..."
2,"No more stereotypical Chinamen, please...","Using Agatha Christie's term for Chinese, I was bothered by her unfortunate use of somewhat racist remarks in this book. However, it was the 1930's, what can I say?However, that is not the reason why I gave this only 2 stars. I don't blame people for using beliefs popular at the time in their literature. The reason 'The Big Four' deserves only 2 stars is because it was: a. lacking a realistic plot (even more so than N or M?) b. badly written. and c. It had Poirot. I hate Poirot. Give me Marple any day. So, basically, I just didn't like it."
2,Not her hest,"I don't think Agatha Christie is at her best when she tries to do conspiracies, international affairs,etc. This book has so many plots and weird characters that it became boring after a while."
4,The Moriarty Syndrome,"Ever since Sherlock Holmes pursued the super-villain Professor Moriarty, mystery writers have seemed compelled to pit their sleuths against an invincible evil opponent, often with the fate of the world in the balance. These efforts universally fall short of the authors' usual standards of excellence (Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe vs Arnold Zeck for instance).Agatha Christie's ""The Big Four"" falls into this category. The saving grace is that Miss Christie treats the whole thing as a joke. The book reads more like an E Philips Oppenheim adventure than a detective story. Because Hercule Poirot is so great, Miss Christie matches him against not one but four super-villains including a Fu Manchu look-alike. There are both overt and subtle references to Sherlock Holmes. Even Chesterton's ""invisible postman"" makes an appearance.Have fun. Forget detection. Approach ""The Big Four"" in the same spirit as you would a James Bond adventure."
1,One of the worst Agatha christie's books,"I admire Agatha Christie very much and am a big fan of her mystery novels. She is at her best when she writes a murder mystery novel with any of her well known detectives such as Hercule poirot or Jane Marple. But Big Four is a ""Big Disappointment"". It has no mystery, no exciting plot and it seems to have been written when Agatha had run out of ideas and had to meet a publisher's deadline. Similar novels of her which fall in this category are Nor M, Passenger to Frankfurt. I am sure there are others which I haven't read which are similar to these titles."
2,Tedious and Uninteresting,"Coming in the wake of Murder of Roger Ackroyd, this book is a major disappointment. It is less of a novel and more of a collection of short mysteries tied by a thin thread. Like the other reviewers point out, the plot is highly unbelievable, and seems to be satirical of other crime literature.I am really glad Agatha decided to ditch Hastings in her latter novels. The running commentary provided by this latter-day Watson is redundant, distracting, and makes the whole thing look more like a story about the greatness of Poirot rather than a mystery that involves the reader. This whole book is too Sherlockian to begin with. There is much going about and doing action, despite the purported emphasis on sitting and thinking and psychology. True, some of it is in jest, such as the twin brother, but the shadow of Holmes is too dominant in this to allow enjoyment of Poirot as Poirot."
4,Who are they?,"Like all of Agatha Christie's books this one is full of suspense, mystery, and drama. This one's a little different. However, the story is not really a who-done-it but a who-are-they and how will Poirot stop the Big 4. I prefer the who-done-its myself. I recommend the book - its a great read."
3,"Extremely silly, but still entertaining","This is one of Dame Agatha's ""thrillers"" (""N or M"" is another example) as opposed to her classic murder mysteries. This one is about a group of four mysterious people whose ""aim is world domination,"" making this read more like a James Bond movie than what you'd normally expect from Christie. Forget any hard detection; the plot twists are extremely silly and credibility flies out the window early on.I still gave it three stars, however, for two reasons. First, it has Poirot and Hastings, and their teamwork, their sparring, their unique quality is just as much in evidence here as anywhere else. Second, as is usual with Christie, it is still entertaining and clearly written. So just don't take this one seriously; enjoy it for what it is."
4,Lots of fun,"Goofy early Poirot has so many plot twists to it, you'll be out of breath keeping track of them all. Hastings narrates again and proves to be his usual muddled self. A nice follow up to Murder on the Links, where he first met his Cinderella, who's only used here as a plot device and never seen. The ending is vintage Christie and vintage Poirot in one. The humor interweaves nicely with some very creative death scenes. Try to overlook the Asian stereotypes as a sign of the times. Once in a while, you can notice a few other remarks in similar fashion in Christie's early works. The English mind set in the 1920's wasn't exactly illuminating"
2,A very slow paced book.,"I was not real impressed with this book. Agatha Christie is supposed to be a great mystery writer, but this was not a great mystery. The only mystery was how I got myself to finish this book. It was very slow paced. The highlight of the book was when Poirot faked his own death to get the jump on the Big Four. Other than that I would not recommend this book."
1,un-Christie-like,I agree wholeheartedly with the Reader From Dallas. This book is un-Christie-like in the extreme. I do not recommend it and advise you to read one of her succeses instead.
2,"Optics work, LEDs are bust","I imagine these have terrible quality control and some work perfect and others don't. They aren't expensive, but they should work. The lens work, and they work fine so they are still usable. The headband is loose, and sloppy but it will stay in place with some clever balancing. The LED's came defective. I tried wiring them to separate power source to test what part of their circuit was defective. For sure the LEDs are blown out (out of the box).Anyway, they are still useable for what I am doing but they should be about half the price given the quality and the LEDs. I think in retrospect I would look for something that has a better fit and then worry about the lighting afterwards."
3,Candle magick,"Not a bad reference but found the spells quite simple. i have a tendancy to like spells that when preparing them they seem to fill with energy. If your preparing a spell and it only takes 2 minutes to prepare and cast it doesnt feel powerful.There isnt a lot of information on preparing for spellcasting and the info provided is very broad, like calling the quarters it is explained to just call the spirits of the west/south etc earth/water but to have the presence of the elementals or archangels i beleive they require the caster to be more specific.Not a bad reference though, it isnt a big book either so if your expecting a treasure chest you'll be dissapointed."
3,It was interesting but repeated it self.,I liked these books they taught you quite a lot about history and I liked the way the story went through the generations .The story line is pretty predictable when it comes to their love life. I definitely think #1 was the best.You should read them but if you don't like book one then you probably won't like the rest.
3,Not to burst your Lovebubble....,"Book of Love are widely acknowledged as a pioneering force in modern rock/alternative music. Sadly, this album lacks the jocularity and boyancy of BOL's earlier works.There are a few good tracks here: ""Happily Ever After,"" ""Hunny Hunny,"" ""Flower In My Hand"" and ""Chatterbox Pt.2"" are all enjoyable, even if they don't hold a candle to ""Alice Everyday"" or ""Turn The World"" from the album ""Candy Carol"" some two years earlier than this effort. The best songs here both clock in at under a minute and a half: the short-but-sweet ballad ""Leap of Faith"" and the equally poignant ""Woyaya.""This is a so-so album, one I'd only recommend for the previously-committed BOL fan. If you're new to BOL, check out ""Candy Carol"" and leave this one behind."
3,Good to complete one's collection,"It should be said, right from the beginning, that this is a good album.It is only by the standards of Book of Love's first two albums that their last full length release seems not very spectacular. Nonetheless, it is well worth purchasing - the version of Bowie's ""Sound and Vision"" (original from his album ""Low"") is one of many highlights.Don't be put off by seemingly limited avilability, neither. The album is readily able to be purchased from numerous suppliers: mine was shipped internationally within five days.Fourteen tracks provide ample opportunity for Book of Love to demonstrate why they are an utterly compelling group, and why we are all worse off without them."
5,"A CERTIFIED CLASSIC - NO BUTS, NO MAYBES!","I bought this album soon after I moved to New Orleans in 1980 - it became an essential component of my living there for seven years, and has continued as a memento of that experience. Forget that the core band are British musicians, since their playing invests these vintage tunes with a vitality and intensity which has yet to be matched, either by the originals or subsequent cover recordings. Along with the authenticity vested by New Orleans natives Lee Allen and Roger Lewis, the piano of Diz Watson and particularly the drumming of Kieran O'Connor are exemplary. Regrettably, there's nothing in New Orleans today which exemplifies this degree of respect and musical expertise in honoring the 50's New Orleans R&B tradition."
1,This book is an unfortunate dissapointment,"The material covered in this book is very basic, and quite frankly, not very inspiring. Those interested in this subject would make a better investment of their money by purchasing Beth Cote's Altered Books 101 and/or Altered Books 102 (I would not recommend Altered Books 103) and/or Holly Harrison's Altered Books. All three of these books do an excellent job covering the subject."
4,Worth owning,"Bev Brazelton's book walks the reader through some essential altered book techniques and she does it well. If you are interested in altering, this is a must have for your bookshelf. It is clear, well organized and shows excellent examples."
4,Great for beginners-excellent photos,"If you are new at altered books this is a good way to get started. It is a small book with good, basic ideas to get your feet wet.I have to agree with another reviewer in that I would not recommend tearing out pages before starting your book. Tear as you go and you'll probably be pleased you waited.If you are experienced with altered books you might still enjoy the book but you may already be familiar with the techniques presented within these pages. Probably not very interesting for younger children but my neighbor's daughter who is 13-14 borrowed it and her mom reported back that she can't pry her daughter away from her arts and crafts projects now."
4,Inspiring,"I thought this book was well worth the money. It is well photographed and gives many basic ideas as to the creatingof altered books. I am glad I have this book in my arts library. It goes well with Altered books 101 and 102.For people who have already been creating altered books, this one might seem like a review of sorts. I think it is especially helpful to those of us who need a little nudge in the right direction.I know that the women I share creative time with will enjoy looking through this book."
5,Nice.,I haven't read the book yet but I imagine it's good. The book was in great quality for being used. I am very happy to add it to my collection.
5,Precious Child CD,"CD is excellent, even better than I expected. Delivery, however, was poor. Paid for rush delivery (2-3 days) and received in regular mail a week later. Maybe the folks shipping needed the $5 worse than I."
5,a superb rock record,"This remarkable album still sounds exciting and relevant twenty years after its release. Anyone who likes rock music that is at once adventurous, smart and tuneful, will appreciate this masterpiece."
4,"Overrated, not the Oil's best","For some strange reason, this album seems to get a lot of attention and hype as being the best MO album. Although it has a few classics in the Midnight Oil catalog, it's definitely not their best album. All albums prior to Diesel and Dust show the band trying to find the right balance of melody and experimentation. Plus, for a band with a strong sense of guitars-drums-vocals, this album has too much sythesizer and electronic drum noodling.I'd put this album in the center of a list of albums from best to worst. Blue Sky Mining, Diesel and Dust, and Earth Sun Moon all outshine this one."
5,beauty and energy in a capsule,"im just a lover here, complex and sublime, Oils, more energic and intriguing album, this is THE ALBUM to own"
5,AMAZING !!!!,"10-1 was the first music recording I ever bought and to this day,(thousands of music purchases later) I still consider it one of the best purchases I ever made. For those looking to get into the Oils, this is the perfect starter album.....If you can handle this, you can hadle the rest."
5,The Oils Rock!,"I have the original LP record version of this album and despite the fact it would sound better on CD, the intense and original songs still manage to give me goosebumps. Not only is the music infectious and extremely danceable (Read About it, US Forces), the lyrics are also contentious,political and daring. Its also wonderful to see so many US listeners appreciating this band for what its worth. Although its hard to pick the 'best'""Midnight Oil"" album this ranks as one of the all time faves amongst Aussies, especially those of the Eighties Era. UNfortunately, most people my age (20)are too young to appreciate this particular album. Im just glad my mother got me on to it when I was a tot!- it's fantastic! I just hope more American listeners 'discover' it, and other Oils CD's (Dont buy them on Vinyl, you just can't turn it up loud enough- besides the fact that record players are so passe!)"
4,excellent rewrite for all ages to understand vs org. text,"anderson's background in grammer and old english styles allows her to take original text to a more readable and simplistic version. After reading original text you can become a little bogged down in it's old english style, as translated by j. smith in the early 1800's. The new easy to read version of the book of morman does not take any new docterine approaches. Sticks directly to the orginal text but uses english background to bring the message of ancient america home to the comman man. Great work and great contribution to sticking to orginal text and themes."
4,The score with the midas touch,"One of the few Bond films where the score is as good as the film Sean is at his best and Barry delivers one of his best scores for a Bond film and here it is at last complete on a single disc (the bonus tracks were released on the British LP and later on the Bond Twenty Fifth Annivesary Edition two disc set). Bassey""s title is the best she did for the films. The highlights of the CD are Bond Back In Action Again for the pre-credits featuring the Bond Theme at its coolest and Dawn Raid On Fort Knox which is a soaring peice of action music as Pussy's pilots gas the Fort. This score is filled with classic Barry big brass sections and is amust for all fans of Barry's music.P.S. Why weren't Man with the Golden Gun, Dr No, From Russia with Love, Octupussy, and A View to a Kill given the same treatment is beyond me Money restraints my a**."
4,Great for my little phone charger project,Got to me fast and works great for my little cell phone charger that I made to take backpacking or keep for emergencies. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it didn't come with the 9v clip so I had to solder wires on. Not a bid deal but had I realized this I would of just went to radio shack and got it for half the price. I'm still happy though. It served it's purpose. Oh and it's wired up in series. Not parallel.
1,Bad quality control,"I ordered two units to test this product out. One worked, the other had a bad connection and was useless (couldn't get to the disconnect to try to solder it either). Not really a good price on this either. This type of unit also requires an additional 9v-type snap connector - which could be a plus if your project needs a quick way to switch out power units, but in my case just added to the expense of using this item. All in all, I do not recommend."
3,Tough Problems and wordiness...,"To do some of the problems in this book you have to know a lot of physics and math. Not good for a lower level course in Engineering. I recently used this book in a semester long course and found that the author overused adjectives, and details to make things far too complicated. However on the bright side the book is very informative, good for a reference to MATHCAD."
3,Pretty good book,"Well, this book is good in a sense that it provides you with exercises that you could work on. But it is kind of wordy, make my eyes go hay wire. Overall, it is a good reference book."
4,Well researched and well written,"Julia Gelardi has written an extensively researched book, her subjects come alive through their letters. I felt that these women had a surprisingly tough life , when you think of princesses you think that they have a pretty good life but after reading this book , they had heartache and problems just like the rest of us.I look forward to reading more of Julia`s books."
3,Too flowery...,"It's a little sad that such an interesting historical set of subjects has been made overly flowery. While the facts and stories are accurate, the ornateness of the language feels forced.For example, check the first page of the hardcover edition via Amazon's Look Inside feature. The author writes that ""...Maud was not expected to occupy the same vaulted position as her eldest brother..."" Vaulted is an architectural term; clearly the author means vaunted.That said, the actual stories are very engaging and well-cited. Just be prepared for some groan-worthy florid prose and the occasional misused word."
2,Very interesting; very poorly written,"It should be pointed out that this is a very interesting comparison and appears to be well researched. However, the grammatical errors, basic spelling errors and failure of the author to keep events within the era she is writing of is enough to make one put this book down and give it up out of frustration."
3,Please find a new editor!,"While I found the facts interesting and the writing acceptable, Ms. Gelardi should find a new editor. Typos and transposition of numbers in dates (e.g. incorrectly listing a date in the 1890s as being in the 1980s,) were irritating and detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book."
3,Interesting yet unfulfilling,"Born to Rule is interesting - almost fascinating - reading. Yet it is obvious from the outset that the author has chosen a favourite. Gelardi tries to give equal time to all five women, but fails as soon as Queen Marie of Romania is mentioned. She spends chapters and chapters expounding on the private tribulations of Marie while leaving Queen Maud of Norway as a virtual stranger to the reader. Queen Sophie of Greece, Empress Alexandra of Russia, and Queen Victoria of Spain all seem to have the just the right amount of attention paid to their stories. The author also seems a little too fond of the royal family's nicknames for everyone. It's easy to get confused after a while. But for these faults, the book is very informative, enjoyable, and a fairly easy read. It's not quite a stay-up-way-too-late-because-you-can't-put-it-down book, but it's a good addition to any collection of Victorian Royal biographies."
2,Superficial at best,"This book rehashes all the old anecdotes without providing anything new. Coverage is superficial at best, and the writing is full of grammatical and mechanical errors, as well as problems in chronology and organization. If the reader is new to the period or personalities, it just might do, but there are plenty of better sources available. Not recommended."
3,Too Much Favoritism.,"The problem with group biographies is often that the author likes one of the people best, and focuses on him/her to the extent that it overshadows the others. This is much the case with Born to Rule. Early on, the author clearly chose Missy as a favorite and declined to write as much about the others, especially Maud, who I personally thought was more interesting, though Missy might have been the most lively. On Queen Marie, it was an excellent biography, but I bought the book for a portrait of all five women. Also, perhaps a little bit on Margaret of Connaught would have been nice, as she did marry Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden and was Crown Princess before she died young."
2,Bad writing can ruin even the most fascinating of stories.,"This book is just awful. The story of five reigning consorts is theoretically fascinating reading, but the writing is so bad, you just feel irritated. Awkward, stilted prose -- often repetitive, often cliched, often overly dramatic -- this book is a pain to read."
5,Fascinating history book,"It was always interesting to see how Queen Victoria ruled the world and reading of her granddaughters who became queens, is very fascinating!!! A part of history that will probably not be repeated except for the present Queen of England.Loved the book, even the footnotes."
1,Born to Rule,Did not receive hard copy. I would like to receive this book if paid for it. I receive an electronic version.
3,Could Have been Really Good,Fascinating topic but I agree with other reviewers who found the writing poor. It distracted from a what could have been a very powerful look at a pivotal time in the history of the western world.
3,Interesting subject matter overall; poor editing,"While I did enjoy the book's subject matter, I agree with previous reviews that the editing was sloppy and there were trite, repetitious passages. I began to dread the sections on Tsarina Alexandra of Russia and Queen Sophie of Greece. The book is worthy of checking out from your library, but I would not recommend buying it. I found ""Victoria's Daughters"" by Jerrold M. Packard to be more appealing."
3,Could have been better,"And I was looking forward to reading this! One major element that kept me from enjoying the book was the numerous typos, sentence fragments and bad punctuation; whoever edited this book was definitely asleep at the wheel.Also, there was a great deal of confusion with regards to people/relationships and I think this was due to two things: The first is due to the writing; the author tends to interrupt her narrative flow, mentioning other people at odd moments or breaking one story to start/resume another. The other is the book's set-up; I think the reader would be better served by ""profiling"" each granddaughter separately, instead of trying to tie all five lives together. This would have helped with keeping family lines straight, and perhaps help keep the overviews more concise.All in all, a disappointment."
2,Try the better book:,"I wouldn't call BORN TO RULE a historical tour de force by any means. There's a shallowness to the writing, and it has numerous little errors of fact that grate on my nerves. Frankly, any reader can get more depth and detail about the lives of Marie of Rumania, Maud of Norway, Alexandra of Russia, et al., from GRANDMAMA OF EUROPE: The Crowned Decendants of Queen Victoria, by Theo Aronson.Mr. Aronson's book covers the same five women covered in Ms. Gelardi's, and while you might have to go to more trouble and expense to get a copy, I can basically promise you a better reading experience; one more expertly written and researched than Ms. Gelardi's."
4,Lacking for a few of its subjects,"Interesting but long read. I also felt that Maud of Norway was by and large neglected... perhaps Gelardi should have just left her out if she wasn't able to find enough info on Maud or if she thought Maud was too boring (which she was in contrast to the lives of the other Queens who were all alternately hated/loved and eventually forced out of their adopted countries or murdered, in the case of Alexandra).I enjoyed the comparisons of personality and fate of the Queens, but would have like to have a genealogical tree handy because I had to constantly remind myself who each Queen was a daughter of.In all, a good read if you are an Anglophile or devourer of all things related to monarchy (like me... sadly enough)."
3,"Well-researched, poorly written","While her sources are impeccable, Gerlardi would have benefited from some serious editing. At times, this reads like a poorly written high school history report-choppy sentences, vague pronouns, and incomplete, abruptly transitioning paragraphs. There is a disconnect between the granddaughters' stories as she has written them, and I agree with other reviewers that a different format-a section for each, with timelines or other graphics to show their overlapping lives-would have been a much better way to tell their stories. I read this immediately after reading FOUR QUEENS by Nancy Goldstone. That book, which has its flaws, is superior to BORN TO RULE."
4,Underrated. A small gem,"Tale of a sixty year old artists relationship with a sixteen year old school has charm, humour and pathos. The leads are more than adequate and the script is thoughtful."
3,Could have been constructed better,"I thought this would be a nice addition to my miter saw and I thought Biesemeyer meant quality, so I wasn't to concerned buying the product unseen. The box arrived undamaged, so I was suprised to see the poor condition of the table once I opened it. The tabs on the feet were all bent which wasn't too big of a deal because I just bent them down with pliers. While doing that, I noticed one of the legs was welded at an angle. No big deal but for the price of it, they should have been flawless. I checked the flatness of the table and it was bowed 1/4"" on end next to miter saw. Zero support from Delta e-mail. Disappointed!"
2,Not sure about this one,The title is definitely a little misleading because I wouldn't consider any of these to be Christian songs. The CD really is just not that good.
1,"Good performance, poor sound.","I cannot believe that so many people give this recording five stars. Sutherland is brilliant. But the sound quality is horrible. The sound is foggy and it echoes as though the performers are singing from a storm drain. The sound level is also very dim. This must have been recorded on a mini-recorder from the last seat in the upper balcony. I can understand wanting to praise Sutherland's performance. She is magnificent. But don't praise a poorly recorded cd just for this reason. Give the consumer a break. Don't buy this foggy mess. Instead, get one of Sutherland's two excellent studio versions. I wasted my money on this set. They make lovely coffee coasters, though."
4,Thumbs Up !!,"Just put one on a Sears contractor saw. Definitly heavy duty. I think a 40"" fence is about as long as is practical on this type saw. Since I have to move the saw around I didn't want the table legs or to buy the mobile base. Be warned this is a universal fence, I had to drill the saw table to mount it. No big deal just get a good 1/4"" drill bit before the fence arrives. The cast iron drills easily. I love the way the fence works on the saw, no ""play"" when locked down and slides over the table easy. You do need to buy or make an extension table for the right side, the directions show how to make one. Don't do without a good fence!!"
1,Memo to record company : writing and producing don't mix ...,"She has a unique and lovely voice but nine of the ten songs here were co-written by her, and her writing can't hold a candle to her singing.With the producer being the co-writer, nobody had any perspective. Undoubtedly her worst album."
3,Modern Irish fiction,"This book contains several short stories. (I had thought it was a novel.) Some of these stores are tangentially related to each other. By far the best one was the longest (maybe one-third of the book) entitled The Big Snow. All the stories are set in a winter of very heavy snow, unusual in Ireland. It is a thoughtful book, not a cant-put-down one. The characterizations in the longest story were wonderful, and the dialogue was superb."
2,The Old Bait & Switch,"The price was right; It arrived on time; But it was the WRONG book.As I ordered the book I requested the 11th edition. What I got was the 9th edition. I just had a baby 2wks ago, and we are starting our second week of class so I don't have the energy to fight it. Its just a little frustrating to not be fully confident that I am on the same page as my peers."
2,Biased Authors,The book is well written yet fails to provide various perspectives on social problems. The authors share their liberal views throughout the chapters in the book and fail to include other viewpoints. I found the book unbalanced and was disappointed by the overbearing opinions of the authors.
5,Great Service!,I needed this book for a class that was starting the next week and it arrived on time. I had emailed the seller to let them know when I needed the book and they assured me that I would receive it on time. I was very pleased with the service.
4,Social Problems and Quality of Life Issues Class Book,"Social Problems Class Book for school, great shape, and covers some tough issues with varying opinions, Highly recommended even for leisure reading to get a feel for today's society"
4,not one miss in this collection,"A beautiful command of texture and meter, with a clarity that so many avoid these days. There is a depth in her work that it's simplicity belies. The work is done for you, enjoy."
2,Not blown away,"I bought this book after reading two 5 star reviews. I am amazed that we read the same book. These poems are cute and witty, sometimes provocative (e.g. ""Herring"" and ""Failure 2"") but they never left me breathless. Perhaps my standards are too high. Kay Ryan's gift is her ability to write tight short poems that always contain subtle rhyme schemes. However, she rarely has anything important to say and her poems have no emotional power. Again, perhaps my standards are too high. Or maybe I have just been spoiled by the works of poets like Lucille Clifton and Joy Harjo. I recommend this book for large libraries only. If you looking for poetry that is fresh, emotional powerful, and relevant to the everyday world that we live in, try anything by Clifton, Harjo, E. Ethelbert Miller and Diane Lockward."
1,Poor Range,The range is actually 1 Mile only.Its not 10 Mile Range that has mentioned on the product.we were disappointed.
1,Very poor range,Great radio but I got .3 miles flat land with trees range.I though more of motooh wellBeware !!!!!!!!!!!
4,INTERESTING STORIES,"Although 'Killer Weather' does not include any fascinating new information about America's meteorological disasters, it is worth reading anyway. One hears twelve chilling stories of death and survival involving hurricanes, tornadoes and floods. The best and longest chapter deals with the New England Hurricane of 1938, in which the author was an eyewitness.Disasters included here are as follows: The New York Blizzard of '88, The Year Without a Summer, Galveston Hurricane, New England Storm of '38, Agnes, 1925 Midwest Tornado, Super-Outbreak of '74, Donnora Smog, Andrea Doria Collision, Big Blowup in Northwest, and finally the Dust Bowl and the Sahel Famine of the early 70's."
2,Who is singinsg?,"This ""supposed"" recording of Bumbry, Bergonzi,Baglioni,etc. is not those singers at all. It is Arroyo, Lamberti, Manuguerra and Morris from an earlier met performance of 1975. I recognize it because I was there. You also cannot miss the voice of Martina Arroyo. Now, if you want Bumbry and Bergonzi, dont buy this. But as a good performance you wont be dissapointed. Arroyo recorded so little, this is a nice addition to her small catalogue. Sound is good, and the other performers are acceptable."
1,"The ""Gay Fox""?","Personally, I suspect the co-authors' attempt to paint Bill Miner as a (homosexual) is wishful thinking on their part. It seems to me there's more of this in books & movies nowadays. I guess it's a way of trying to sell books ""with a new spin"" on an already well-researched subject (especially when there's no one left alive to sue the for libel)."
1,Might have to read this,"The critic's review of this book is rather depressing when one considers what happened when Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Productions hired Richard Farnsworth to play the title role in the early 1980s film, The Grey Fox. The film was brilliant from beginning to end as are most of Farnsworth's films. Also, in the film, there is no mention of a gay lifestyle though back in the early 1980s, that was more taboo than today. Find the video and enjoy the story."
4,Jazz at it's best,"Once again, Diane Schuur has done it. I look forward to getting more of her CD's. Whether with a small group or a big band , she fits right in"
1,Cheap Don't buy it!,This item broke in 2 place in my hands as soon as I touched it. Do not waste your money on this junk. No even worth returning as shipping would be more expensive than this junk!
2,Not like the picture.,"I was pretty disappointed when I saw the product I received. The silver ends on the cord appear very cheaply made and do not look the same as in the picture provided. They are much shorter than what is shown and the piece that fits into the clasp is thicker, making it more awkward to put on and take off. I would not recommend purchasing this, and I'm currently looking into getting another cord to replace this one."
4,"Wonderful score, great production!",The Pajama Game was an excellent revival on Broadway! The recording translates the energy of the production. O'Hara is a beautiful talent!
1,"stay away from ""thou shalt not""","i didn't even throw the celestine prophecy away as fast as I trashed this CD . . .Unless you like the Broadway obscure, Thou Shalt Not is horrid!"
4,Better to wait for PAJAMA GAME to get a separate release,"The Roundabout Theatre Company's revival of this 1954 musical sold-out every performance thanks to stellar reviews and the Broadway musical debut of Harry Connick Jr. He and co-star Kelli O'Hara add sparkle to this classic, and Connick's jazz piano riffs on ""Hernando's Hideaway"" are alone worth the price of the two-disc set.Yes, there are two discs packaged as HARRY ON BROADWAY ACT ONE. In order to get THE PAJAMA GAME you also have to buy a second Cd of jazz interpretations from Connick's failed 2001 musical THOU SHALT NOT. It does appear that the two discs will eventually be released separately but for now it's a package deal only.The booklet is disappointing: No synopsis or production notes and only four black and white photos from the show."
3,Not your average harry,"From what I had come to know of HCJs work this is very left field. It made me think of the old black and white midday movies from my youth, but still enjoyable. I think that if I saw the actual productions I would have a greater appreciation of the work but it is still good background music."
1,Misinformation,"Shirley MacLaine did not play Babe in the Broadway version of The Pajama Game. The role was originated on Broadway by Janis Page and then played in the movie version by Doris Day. In both these versions the play was written with the female character as the lead part although it was redone with the male part as the lead for Harry Connick, Jr. in the recent Broadway revival."
3,Wish They Would Have Offered Separately,"I really enjoyed ""The Pajama Game"", but was rather bored with ""Thou Shall Not""."
2,"Worth one histroical listen, but that's it","All the defects noted about this set are true. The sound is extremely murky, and the ensemble is very ragged. Stravinsky could be a decent conductor of his own music, but on the night of this premiere he must have been nervous, since the tempi are lagging and dragging throughout. The continuo is a piano rather than a harpsichord (the instrument used on every other performance). The two leads, Rounseville and Schwarzkopf, do their best but are clearly hampered by Stravinsky's failure in the pit. All in all, this set is worth one listen for historical purposes, but that's about it."
2,Could have been great,"I was really excited when I started reading this book. The characters were fairly deep and well-developed, and the circumstances were at once amusing and understandable. And then I was halfway through the book and nothing had happened yet. Lo and behold, I finished the book, and still, nothing really happened. There is a rushed bit about robbing a restaurant and running from gangsters, but it all happens so fast that there is no time to really care. The writing is good, the characters are interesting, but this book should have been at least twice as long as it is. In its present form, it reads like a story from a talented writer who realized on Monday night that he had a dealine on Tuesday morning."
2,Something missing,"I could not wait to get another book from Tony. However, this one seems to be missing something. I liked ""Bone In the Throat"" and felt that ""Gone Bamboo"" was good as well. This one, however, seems overwhelmingly simple in comparison. It does have Tony's wit and the food references and the mafia connection but not as many twists and turns as the other two books. We also miss out on the colorful scene descriptions. It's just too simple. If you haven't read Bourdain's fiction yet, start with the other two and then finish off with this one. Tony, I hope the Les Halles cookbook will be better."
3,This book is unfinished,"Too bad. I was hoping for a book as good as (or even better than) Bone In The Throat or Gone Bamboo. Instead he gives us some great characters, rushes them into interesting relationships, and then develops neither. There's no pay-off at the end when it could have gone so many different ways. Shame on you, bro!"
3,He needs to stick with non-fiction,"His non-fiction and essays are great, but this book, which is fiction, just comes off as flat. It was like he got offered a deal to write whatever he wanted based on his non-fic success and just decided to blow it on cramming in every fantasy plot idea he had into a very thin book."
2,"No, no, and no.","I read someone's review of this book that was positive. I wish I remembered who so I could write them a nasty letter. It may actually deserve only one star. Paper thin characters, no substance, gratuitous violence, and, oh yeah, no real story. I hope the author cooks better than he writes. Save your money o serious readers; there must be something better out there."
4,"Not his best work, but still enjoyable","The Bobby Gold Stories follows in the mafia-esque footsteps of Bourdain's previous efforts at fiction, and comes up somewhat short. There's not a whole lot of character development here, and what serves as a plot is rather choppy and incoherent throughout most of the book. It was almost like Tony couldn't decide if he wanted to write a novel or a bunch of short stories. Sadly, references to the food service industry were sorely lacking in this one. I think he should keep that, as it really sets him apart and makes his work that much more unique. Regardless, it was still fun to read, and I look forward to more of his work."
4,K-Swiss review for Amazon,I like the shoes. I have had 2 other pair of shoes of the same product/shoe and they fit great. Until I went to a professional shoe fitting store I would have never bought K-swiss. My view of them was one of a more trendy/young persons shoe. The salesman suggested the shoe and when I tried it on I was very pleased.With the pair I just bought the one thing I noticed is it appears to have sat on a shelf for a long time. The material around the heel feels rough and dried out compared to my other shoes.
2,Harry K. - The Reluctant Barber,"Breaks with a bit of humor. Harry K.'s THE RELUCTANT BARBER shows a few good cuts can do. But, in all honesty, there's not much there musically. Maybe a few discordant tones on the short ""Bring It"" or the funk bass of ""Pretty."" The quicker ""Pen to the Pad"" tries to raise pulse rates, and the darker ""Boo The Hero"" grooves with a touch of psychedelia and jungle, but, overall, sort of blah."
1,Not worth the rental,"If you are looking for a version of Anything Goes, don't bother. This was a recorded special featuring Ethel Murman and doesn't follow the current storyline. The only redeeming quality is getting to hear Frank Sinatra sing."
1,Anything Goes,I loved Frank Sinatra and like Ethel Merman but this Video was terrible. I thought it was going to be a movie and you stated in the Information that Bind Crosby was in this and he was not. This was a live TV show and it was terrible. The singing was great but everything else was not good. You could see that Frank Sinatra whom I am a great fan of was not comfortable in this show. Do not buy this you will very disappointed.
4,"Fun, but know what you're getting","This is a 50-minute TV musical from the 1950s, set in the Roaring Twenties. It's built around Cole Porter songs, some of which are from his 1934 Broadway musical of the same title.The plot and dialog are radically different from the Broadway original, though there are some common points: it's still a shipboard comedy, Merman again plays a nightclub singer named Reno Sweeney, and there's still a comical gangster named Moonface (played beautifully by Bert Lahr) and a pompous nobleman named Lord Evelyn. But the script was largely new for this TV version.It's a great cast and the program is fun, as long as you're not expecting the Broadway show. One highlight for theater buffs: Merman and Lahr singing ""Friendship,"" which they originally introduced together in another Porter musical in the 1930s.The picture and audio quality on this DVD release are a pleasant surprise: they're much clearer than any of the earlier video releases I've seen of this live broadcast."
2,Fairly boring,I knew it was going to be short however it was just corny. These actors had/have big names but they are not up to par with todays actors and singers.
4,An Interesting Book,"""Death in the Grizzly Maze"" is a very interesting book. I enjoyed reading it. I recommend it to anyone interested in the questions of how we interact with nature and grizzly bears in particular.The book illustrates the belief of some that people can achieve a real rapport & trust with large dangerous wild animals, like the grizzly bear. That notion just doesn't make sense to me. Bears do not think and act like us and we cannot think and act like bears. Our understanding of grizzly bears is always going to be limited.It seems to me that Timothy Treadwell, in many of his bear encounters, must have been living through an adrenaline high. This may explain his need to keep going back to the bears year after year. I don't understand why Katmai National Park officials allowed Treadwell to keep violating their rules concerning bears.It is sad to know that two people & two bears died because of someone's misunderstanding of nature."
3,Nutter,It was an ok book. Kind of rehashes things over and over. Would have liked more on Treadwells friend instead of all on him. I would guess it's kind of hard to have much to say about Treadwell since he really didn't do much in life except get himself killed and kill his friend. I would say that he was very lucky for many years and then that luck just finally ran out.
