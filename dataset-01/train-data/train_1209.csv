4,Very good case,"Especially for the price, this is a good case (especially if your priority is more utility than glamor)... excellent protection, very good fit, feels good in-hand, all controls remain very usable. A drop to the floor is no worry. Makes it a little bulky, ok in my briefbag or jacket pocket (but too big for shirt or slacks pocket). Hard screen protector provides excellent protection, although with a little optical distortion. Rubber grooves let me wrap-around the cord from my cheap earbuds to help it stay untangled. Belt clip is a bit bulky, is white(??!!) and the player swings on it (no detents to prevent rotation). The other 4-to-5 star reviews have good remarks."
5,Best protection,"The Speck ToughSkin is the best protection for the Sansa, hands down. It's rubber notches makes it easier to grip and stays where you put it. The buttons are easier to work except for the volume (have to use a finger nail or a light touch), but how often do you constantly adjust the voume. The skin is a pain to get on, but that's good cause it won't fall off. I use my Sansa while working outside, ie. mowing, weedwacking and other outdoor household duties and I don't have to worry about the sansa falling and being damaged. The only thing that I wish was that the belt clip didn't release so easily, but can understand that it might be designed that way so you can pop it off, make adjustments and put it back on the clip without a fight. The easy fix for that was to use the clip that came with my cell phone."
1,Boots will not stand behind product,"Asked Boots for a refund on their poor quality MASCARA and this was their reply:""Thank you for contacting Boots.Boots does not offer refunds for general dissatisfaction and apologize for this inconvenience. Everyone has different skin types and will have varying levels of skin change.Sincerely,Boots Customer Service"""
2,One big mess!,"The idea behind this is great -and the sand really does mold pretty well. There are three colors - blue, green and yellow. There is more green than blue and yellow (not sure why). I helped guide the kids to use it over the opened plastic case - but a ton of it still managed to get on them, on the chairs and on the floor. It dusted off of them ok and didn't leave any coloring on the chairs, but if you are one who sees sand all over the place and cringes, well, maybe look for something else. I think I am going to ""hide"" this toy so it is out of sight, out of mind, unless they can play it outside (but then they can play with real sand). Unfortunately, I gave this as presents for two birthday parties before having first hand experience with it, and I wonder if my kids will be invited back next year. :-)"
3,Be Prepared for the Mess,"Got this as a gift for our son. It is an artificial sand complete with molds and tools plus some added little toys. The sand have pretty candy colors and are very attractive. It is a lot of fun for the kids, but at the same time it is frustrating for them attempting to create critters with the molds as the sand crumbles very easily. It needs some help from grown-ups to press the mold harder to make a press. Still, once they hold them with their hands they crumbles. Obviously, not for kids who love to put things in their mouths.It is just no way you can have this toy played inside the house especially near carpets or your couch. Be prepared for a big mess."
3,Ask for extra packing!,"I ordered two Dap Easy Caulk. Very little packing, causing one of them to explode in the carton.It was a mess!!!!!!"
1,Exploded in the box,"Should have opened this a bit sooner - when I finally did, the pressurized contents appear to have exploded in transit. As a result, I now own an unreturnable (past 30 days) box of dried easy caulk with a bottle cemented in the middle. If you buy this, don't do it online."
5,Medical use of Anabolic Steroids,"To request this type of therapy from a Doctor without being informed, without something to back it up would be like... standing in front of a wall and hearing...fire!. ""Built to Survive"", gave me the knowledge to tackle the prejudice and stigma attached to the medical use of Anabolic Steroids to treat HIV. It gave me the necessary information to argument successfully. It's easy to read and it's very, very well researched. I liked the impresive reference bibliography that adds a scientific approach to it. This book taught me how to do this therapy and how to do it right, with nutrition and exercise, to maximize all the potential medical benefits of the use of Anabolics Steroids to treat HIV. Excellent job!."
3,TetraFin FLakes,"The food was fine. The fish ate it, Not quite the same as the other tetra fish food I've used, but it worked fine. I did notice the fish tank getting dirty a lot quicker. BUT... I also changed the filters I used around the same time, so it could have been either or, or maybe BOTH."
4,Not too bad....,"This food is for fish with huge mouths. The flakes are ginormous and I'm thinking that the manufacturer thinks he's feeding dogs, not fish! And, they float to the bottom so fast that the fish barely have time to grab the flakes - before they knock them out after landing on them! One of these flakes landed on our frog and terrorized the poor thing! Anyway, that said, if you have tetras, don't buy this food - just get something else. I use this for my angel fish and something else for the tetras. Great food otherwise, but I wish they'd find a way to keep the flakes on the top for awhile. I won't mention how they dirty up the tank quickly...."
4,A GREAT BARGAIN,"Local pet stores charge twice the price for these exact flakes. They might be coloring my aquarium water, though, so I might try another brand."
3,fish like it,"I wish this didn't all float. The fish don't swim on the surface of the horses' water trough. Oh well, they eat it when it starts to sink."
1,HORRIBLE! Leaves my fish tank dirty!!,"Ever since I started using this fish food for my goldfish, the water has gotten dirtier fast then ever before. I know goldfish are dirty, but the water got dirty less then 2 days! It also makes the fish poop colorful which I don't think means anything. I do not recommend this fish food at all. I am switching back to the original food I was giving them."
1,Phoney reviews?,"I was over at another site and every review sounded like it was written by the Tetramin company. They didn't even sound natural.I tried to post a more objective review (simply describing my fishes reaction to the flakes with no judgments attached) and was denied. Couldn't post.In fact, my fish tend to ignore this food. I had a food some years ago that my fish of that time (same species) ate well. Wish I could remember the name because I would go back to it.Thumbs down for Tetramin's phoney reviews (paid shills?) and unreliable product."
3,Misleading Listing,"Photo shows a box of Tetra Min Flake Food that is over 1 pound. When item arrived it was a 7.06 ounce can. After viewing the listing again, I realized the description was not completely reviewed. Please make sure you dont make the same mistake."
5,as expected,This item isn't bad for the amount of food versus the price paid. The fish don't seem to have any problems with it.
4,Tropical Community Fish Love it,"We have Giant Danios, Tiger Barbs and Black mollies and they all seem to love it. I think this product is worth the value and is almost priced the same as Petsmart if not less."
4,bright colors,"These flakes do really seem to brighten the colors on the koi and comet goldfish in my tank, and it is practically a lifetime supply- its a really big container for the price."
2,"Berry understands space, but not Earth","I suppose it's only fair to mention that really, this book is kind of cool in its predictions, in its splendidly comprehensive bibliography, and even in a certain Britishness of style. I don't mind it; Robert Heinlein would have loved it. And therein lies the reason why I only gave it two stars.Adrian Berry does not understand a d--n thing about ecology, or about its value to the future. As far as I can tell, he's not particularly religious, but he might as well be in his attitude toward the Earth--you know, ""be fruitful and multiply, and all living things were given unto you for your dominion"", or whatever. He does not get it.This is why I cannot really recommend it unless you are prchasing it very cheaply indeed. For a more ecologically aware view, Marshall Savage's The Millennial Project is certainly worthwhile."
2,Unless you want to mount the saw to a wall you must have a stand.,"Unless you want to mount the saw to a wall you must have a stand. This does the job but is cheaply designed and made. The stand is simply galvanized ""angle iron"" with a bag full of U-bolts and low grade nuts and bolts. Instruction sheet is crude so you have to figure out how to assemble it the best way you can."
5,NICE,"Purchased this and a Makita grinder (from Amazon) to remove bark and sapwood from a slab of mesquite; intend to use as a sofa table top. Oh yah, BTW there was an active powder post beetle infestation involving the bark and sap wood. This chainsaw-like grinder attachment cut very efficiently and I had the job done in no time. No grabbing or kickback.Though the Makita grinder did not specifically recommend this kind of blade attachment, I found it to work well w/this grinder."
3,Good chainsaw sculpture tool,"This tool does exactly what it is advertised to do. It removes wood - a lot of wood - fast. I have been using it to rough out wood bowls from cherry burls. It works fine to carve away the outer bark, but it's a bit too aggressive for working on the inside of the bowl. It seems better fit for the world of 'chainsaw sculpture', bears and eagles and such, where precision is less of a concern.STRONG warning - be VERY, VERY careful with this tool. It is every bit as dangerous as a chainsaw. Wear leather gloves and eye protection, or even a full face shield, at ALL times when using this tool. Do NOT remove the guard from your grinder. Double check the arbor nut before every use. I found out that most experienced carvers (which I am not) stay away from this type of tool for intricate work due to the dangers involved."
3,Cheaply made - but works ok - you get what you pay for I suppose,I had to glue cheap plastic fixtures together as it fell apart just getting it out of the box.You get what you pay for I suppose.
3,Funny little score,"I don't know the circumstances that led Danny Elfman to only compose the main titles and ending selection for this soundtrack, but his compositions are quite fun. Definitely a switch from his dark stuff, it harkens back to his Oingo Boingo days, with a twist of Caribbean. The rest of the album is okay, listenable, but nothing to rave about. It's fun and bouncy in the style of Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Back to School. (Sheffer has conducted some of Elfman's scores, so I think it has rubbed off on him.) I got it cheap, and I would say try to find it on sale, unless you're one of those If-It's-Elfman-I've-Got-to-Have-It people."
2,Do not buy this if you are not 100% sure its what you need,This order will ship from a 3rd party called Tech Depo. I ordered 2of them for the wrong slot type and they DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS!!!SO now I am out over 500 dollars.Be careful
1,Boring,"This book takes way too long to get anywhere. Also, the heroine of the book, Jane MacGuire, is annoyingly tough for a 21 year old. Yeah, yeah...she was a street kid, yada, yada, yada, but no 21 year old really acts like that. The sexual obsession between her and much older man, Mark Trevor, is rather gross.This book was a waste of my time."
1,Couldn't finish it...,I have read some of Iris Johansen's books previously. This one does not compare. It found myself skipping pagest upon pages and finally just not reading any more about half way through...
4,"Very good story, but something was missing....","I have read the whole Eve Duncan series and although I found COUNTDOWN to be a very good story there was something missing. It was fast paced and I read it quickly, but it revolved around Eve & Joe's adopted daughter Jane, and I was really disappointed that they were hardly ever mentioned. I hope when she writes the next one she brings them back because I really like those two characters."
1,Total Flop,"I haven't read such a bad book in a while. The plot was far fetched, too fragmented, and unlikely. The characters - especially Jane - unsympathetic. The interaction between the characters is psychologically a stretch.But what really bothered me was the repetitive writing style. ""She stiffened"", ""he stiffened"", ""Trevor stiffened"", ""McDuff stiffened"", there was a lot of stiffening going on - in lieu of interesting action, obviously.Everyone is angry and constantly saying ""dammit"". Jane's gaze flies a lot. Her gaze flies to his face, flies to the action, flies here and there. And she whirls. ""She whirled on him"" - frequently. McDuff whirled a few times, too.Between the stiffening, the whirling, the gazes flying and the dammits, the style was insipid to the point of torture. Needless to say, I do not recommend this book."
2,Countdown was a big Let Down,"Let me start by saying that I generally love this author. But, this one was a huge letdown. I tried to read the story 2 times and ended up giving it to my sister to she if she likes it. I have to say this is probably 2 out of the thousands of books I have read that I just couldn't finish.The book started out with promise but then it almost seemed like the author was trying to push the story and not let it develop. In addition I found that the main female character (Jane) who I have loved in all the other books lacked her normal brilliance and shine in this one. You felt sorry for her and at the same time I was annoyed by her actions, especially with the friend she has protected all these years.I can't say if I liked the ending or if the book gets better because I never got there.I gave the book 2 stars as I did like the initial start (first 20 pages or so) but that was being generous."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","I am an avid reader of Iris Johansen and always buy her books as soon as they are published. I am about half-way through this one and have put it down. I can't keep up with the story, it is so dull. I have to keep re-reading parts just to figure out what is going on. What a waste of money. Check this one out at the library. Please Iris, go back to thrillers."
2,Telling and not showing,"Bla-bla-bla. I was hoping for a thriller, but sadly disappointed. Where was Eve? I really tried to like Jane, but she came across as a hotheaded snot. Trevor and Jane's sexual bantering back and forth left me believing I was reading a bodice ripper and not a thriller. I'm having a really tough time finishing this book. Ancient gold coins verses September 11....please. Sorry, Iris, but bring back Eve."
1,Definitely a disappointing read,"I can generally read anything, but I after I got about halfway through I realized that I really didn't care what happened next. This series started to go downhill with the last book and this one continues the trend. At times I thought I was reading a Harlequin romance, not a suspense thriller. Also disappointing was the fact that Eve Duncan appears only in a supporting role (at least in the half of the book that I managed to read).Don't waste your money - if you must try this one get it from the library."
1,I don't get it.,"This book is so terrible. It's difficult to keep track of who is in alliance with whom. I also couldn't understand why in the world the CIA or FBI would be so interested in this. It just didn't make any sense to me. Maybe it would have been explained later in the book, but I am another that was unable to finish it. I quit about 50% of the way through. I have never read an Iris Johansen book before, and with this being my first attempt, I doubt I will make another."
3,okay but not great,"This book was okay, it was right along the same lines of all of Johnasen's books. I liked most of the ones she wrote a few years ago but lately I feel like something is missing from her books. If you have enjoyed her other books you might like this one but I would say wait untill it comes out in paperback."
1,Put Down Countdown,"What a tangled mess of would-be thrills! The author introduces us to a rather unlikeable heroine and draws us into a tepid plot that combines ancient history and suicide nuclear bombers. The heroine, Jane MacGuire, is unsympathetic; instead of being feisty, she just seems contrary. The dialogue in this book is full of small but continuous argument that becomes very, very tiresome.I listened to the book on CD and found myself skipping to the next track again and again. Here's the most telling point - I really didn't miss anything by fast-forwarding. The plot was predictable and the dialogue as well.After all was said and done, nothing 'happened'. Most unforgivable of all, the author's attempt to create a believable love story fell flat as well. It's really a bad book if even the sex scenes aren't exciting.A must-miss!"
1,Just Awful,"Muddled plot, weak character development, repetitive phrasing, boring conversations -- this book is poorly constructed and almost unreadable. It's supposed to be a thriller, but most of the ""action"" is Jane hanging out, waiting for something to happen: waiting for Mario to finish translating the scrolls; waiting for Jock to come out of his hypnotically-induced brainwashing; waiting for Trevor to have sex with her. And while she's waiting, there are dozens of interminable discussions that only serve to rehash useless plot lines and fill pages!I always try to finish a book, but I've really struggled through this one. After reading other reviews here, it confirms my reaction, so I'm going to take their advice and stop reading. Whew, I feel better already. Thank you, Amazon readers, for telling it like it is!"
1,Done with these books,"As others reviewers have stated I am finished reading Iris Johansen books. The characters are ridiculous and unbelievable, especially the women. I have read the the first 5 books of the Eve Duncan series and they were pretty good but have continued to decline in quality and are just plain repetitive and boring. I will not be able to finish Countdown, horrible book. The women are just snotty and guarded. Jane's character is the worst of all!! Find Bonnie for gosh sake or move on with the story line. Save your money and buy thrillers from someone who knows how to write them."
2,Eh,"This was the first Irish Johansen book I ever read. I noticed this in the store where I work at, and it looked interesting enough, so I thought, why not. I was expecting way more than... this.The story is not very well-constructed and focuses more on the character of Jane and her connection with a Roman woman named Cira. I know this is supposed to be part of a series, but the mark of a good series is that any book within could be read by itself. The story is rather sparse given the description on the back of the book. Unless you're a die-hard Johansen fan, I can't recommend this book."
3,Not the best,I normally love Iris but couldn't get into this one at all. The whole antiquities and the premise did nothing for me. I felt Jane was very one dimensional in this story and I was disappointed in her behavior in general.Sometimes you get a character that only works well when it's with those it was created with. Maybe Jane isn't ready to move out on her own yet.Not ready for a spinoff at least not this one.
2,Not good enough,"I have to say I am getting very bored with the direction Ms. Johansen is taking the Eve Duncan series. First of all, on the cover it states that this is an Eve Duncan story, which is not. This is a Jane Maguire story just like Blind Alley was. Second, this story was filled with nothing more than the sexual tension between Jane and Mark Trevor. If I wanted that, I would buy something with Fabio on the cover. I think Ms. Johansen needs to get the story back on track with Eve, Joe and Bonnie."
4,I'm the only one who can save the world,"I've been buying these books as soon as they come out, but I'm about to start passing them by. All of the female characters have a common attribute -- they seem to believe that they alone are capable of confronting the evil adversary and saving the world. In this installment, never mind that the CIA and Homeland Security can't do the job, Jane isn't about to let the bad guys get away with being bad. Come on Iris. It's too far-fetched to continue having these amateur characters assume such epic responsibilities."
1,please give us the option to rate a book 0 stars!!,"After Blind Alley, I swore I'd never read another Johanssen novel, but I thought I'd give her one more chance. Big mistake. What happened to this author? Why has her writing gone downhill so badly? Is it because Jane (a very immature, unlikeable character) is now the focus? Is it because the plots have become goofy and implausible? Does she have a guarantee that she'll be published no matter what she writes? If ""Countdown"" and ""Blind Alley"" are the best she has left, she's running on empty."
2,unbelievable and boring,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. I'm only halfway through this book and I'm having to force myself to finish it. The main character, Jane, Is not believable at all. Her life is in danger and she's not scared? Instead, she's bold, smart-mouthed, and cocky... and she's only 21! The plot is stupid and I don't care what happens next. Very disappointed. Not sure if I'll be able to finish it or not."
1,No need for a continuation...,"This is a continuation set years after Blind Alley, but it lacks the plot and mystery of the first book. Main character Jane is a few years older now and living on her own when she is targeted again. The unfortunate decision to bring back her ""love interest"" from the first book was longlasting. Most of the book is spent on arguements between the two,flirting, and sex scenes. I did a lot of skimming. Worst of all was that the matchup of the two lacked any chemistry and bordered on being a disgusting age difference especially considering they had met when Jane was a minor. Stick to the first book, this adds nothing but romance under the guise of mystery."
2,Just too much,"Too many pages. Too many characters. Too many settings. Too much dialogue. Too much repetitious internal monoloque. Lacks cohesion. The action, what little there is of it, is fine but it is too tedious and not worth the effort."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"This is a continuation of Blind Alley, which I reviewed some time ago and mentioned there were plenty of unanswered questions for another book. It is now four years later, Jane MacGuire is at Harvard, and during an attempt to kidnap her, her childhood friend is killed. Then Mark Trevor shows up out of nowhere and convinces her to return to Scotland with him so he can protect her. She doesn't totally trust him, but can't deny her physical feelings for him. The problem is: Trevor has the scrolls and knows where the gold is; the really bad guys are after Trevor and think they can get to him through Jane.The story includes several other characters, some in a surprising role, and has everyone trotting around Europe and the U.S. Will they get the bad guys before the blow the country apart? Do they really know who's who? There's enough action and some suspense. And, yes, there are a few unanswered questions for the next episode."
3,Left hanging,"I agree with previous reviewer, Iris let me down. I was anticipating a great ending, but was left with Eve and Jane reminising over better days. No conclusion to the gold, the romance with Trevor.... suspect a lead into the next book. I was disappointed."
1,Unfinishable!,"I must read 100 books a year and I finish 99% of them, even if they don't start out very well. This book is the other 1%. Dull plot, poorly written, stilted language. Yuck!"
1,Count Down,"This book says it's an Eve Duncan thriller. NOT!!! It was all about Jane with a far fetched plot, actually ridiculous.. If you like the forensic aspect of Eve don't by this book. I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Uninteresting,"I found Countdown did not live up to previous books by Iris Johansen. I grew bored with the main character, Jane MacGuire and the contrived ""sexual tension"" between Jane and Mark Trevor. The storyline about ""Cira"" is ludricrous and not believable. I don't recommend this book."
2,Very disappointed,"I have read all of the Eve Duncan books. Although Eve is certainly not warm and fuzzy she is sympathetic given her past. Not so the lead in this book, Jane MacGuire. I flat out don't like this character! She is surly and rude at every turn, and comes across as a spoiled 21 year old know-it-all. I can't imagine what Trevor would ever see in this spoiled brat. I honestly think she is the most pugnacious character I've ever read about. By the end of the book I was actually hoping Jane would get caught by the enemy just so they would shut her up and stop her whining!"
1,A boring book,"It's very rare that I don't finish a book. I most always plod through a story to get to the ending before deciding if I liked it or not. This book, however, just couldn't keep my interest. I gave up about half way and decided it just wasn't worth my time to finish. I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book---especially by Johansen. Terribly disappointed. But I won't give up on her. I hope this was a rare exception."
1,silly,"Really silly to believe that a 21 yr old student can outwit and outmatch international terrorists, homeland security forces, CIA, and various mercenaries just because she is cute and fiesty. This is really old character writing and not very clever, the only interesting part for me was the Egyptian/Roman archeologic tie in."
3,Disappointing ending,"I tried this book since I got it for free. It was pretty interesting throughout bringing out some great ideas and concepts, however the ending was a huge disappointment for me. It just ended and nothing was really concluded. The whole theme through the book was never really resolved and I finished the book without any feeling of enjoyment. I said ""that's it???, what a waste of time""The author could have concluded better in my opinion or closed some tangent story lines that was introduced."
3,Gold???,"This book was just okay for me. I was interested all throughout the book, but I guess I just didn't like how it ended. The whole time we kept hearing about Cira's gold, but in the end no one ever found it. I was kinda ticked when I hit the last page and I didn't get to find out who got the gold after all these characters were fueding over it and even killed over it!!!!"
5,Good read,"As an avid reader, I've read a lot of Iris Johansen's books....all are good, this is no exception. This is another good book."
1,Overly Simplistic,"This book is touted as being a great source for teachers at all grade levels and levels of experience. This book has simplistic, everyday ideas many teachers employ without a book to guide them. Maybe it would be suitable for a brand new teacher, but even then....."
2,Big Scottish cliche,"Boy, was this movie by the numbers. Liams character was a pussy most of the time. Cutty (his boxing opponent) was far too stoic considering he was thoroughly screwed by the end of the film. The ""bad"" guy acted really, really, badly. He was like some confused game show host. The end of the movie sucked really badly, too. The movie might have been salvaged if Liams character had used his loot to bribe an army of drug crazed Columbians to besiege the ""bad guys"" faux castle, force him to OD on his coke, then celebrate with all of the deprived local townspeople in a drug crazed orgy. Instead the film ended with Liams character being celebrated as some half-ass, soon to be deceased, loser ""hero"". I hated this movie."
2,Edgy,"This was my first exposure to Touching Evil, and I'm delighted to be warned. This is an ""edgy"" detective story, meaning violent, ugly, obscene, soap opera like, and without a trace of humor or wit. I'll take Jack Frost, thanks. Buyer beware."
3,"Nice live music, but sounds a lot like the studio versions","This is a nice album of early live hits at Austin City Limits. The only draw back is many of the songs sound very similar to to the studio versions. Compared to the DVD (which I liked better) much of the dialog with the audience was cut out of the CD. Dwight fans will like this, but it's hard to recommend it to anyone else. It's okay, but nothing spectacular. Dwight's other live album is much better and easier to reccomend. A newer Dwight Yoakam live album would have been a better CD by New West Records."
4,An interesting series with deep and thoughtful characters,"This is not the first book in Oliphant's (who is also A.J.Orde and Sherri Tepper) series about Shirley McClintock and her household, but it does bring back characters from earlier books. Shirley McClintock runs a guest ranch, along with her live-in companion, JQ; a retired friend, Xanthippe, who also lives with them, and Shirley's adopted daughter Allison. Besides the main plot, which involves an almost-anonymous guest dying after Shirley and JQ rush her to the hospital, there's also a subplot in which we find out more about Allison's family.Semi-""spoiler"" (don't read this paragraph if you want absolutely no hint as to the resolution of the plot) - Oliphant manages to neatly skewer both UFO/alien encounter nuts, and ""repressed memory"" therapists who see Satanism everywhere. If you like clear, logical thinking about these issues, you'll enjoy how they are brought into the plot and then treated as the pseudoscience they are."
2,For lazy people only,I framed a house last year and I only used the stick three times. I think it is fine for very lazy people or for a guy framing 100 houses a day.
3,Good game but came broken,"I was disappointed when I opened the box to find the broken frame. It was on the underside where one one the legs attaches. It was caused by a loose piece moving while being shipped. My wife was not in favor of this purchase so I was in a tough position that Christmas Eve around midnight. The instructions say returns can be made, but at your expense. Not a option. So, I got my wood glue and my clamps and went to work. I was able to save Christmas. Santa would have been proud, my wife, not so much. The table was a huge hit hours later when the kids got up. It plays fast. The size was perfect for my space. The score keeper is cheap but does the job. In the end, my wife loves it more than the kids. All is right with the world."
2,Yoko walks like an Egyptian,"Out of all the album covers Yoko has put out over the years, this is my favorite.The ancient splendor of the pyramids and Yoko as the mysterious Sphincter is so apropos."
2,A Surprising Two Stars,"Of all the Yoko albums, I despise this one least. That's like saying of all the forms of cancer, I despise brain tumors least."
4,Baked Ambition,"My husband is an aspiring baker, and all of the fantastic pictures and out-of-the-ordinary recipes are just what he needs to expand his horizons. Our only complaint is that the pictures are often pages away from the actual recipe, making it harder to correspond the delicious thing we want to make and the recipe for it."
4,All Encompassing Baking Book,"This book gives enough information to get anyone started in baking. If you were to only have one book on baking, you wouldn't be far off the mark in getting this one. My only criticism is that, although there are a number of color photos scattered here and there of the finished products, it would have been nice to have more ""how to"" photos included in sequential order accompanying the text for each recipe. But all in all, this is a great baking book."
5,Julia does it again!,"The relatively old ""Baking with Julia"" book is still one of the best. The chapters on French backing are truly excellent, with clear, precise directions and alternatives (as for instance, making the dough by hand or by mixer). If you're a dedicated baker, this book is well worth having."
5,A gift my daughter almost didn't get.,"For the serious baker, your cookbook collection is really not complete without this reprint. Gorgeous illustration and wonderful recipes in Julia's own no-nonsense style."
3,Way too time-consuming for my lifestyle,"This is a wonderful book for impressing your guests with interesting recipes. However, I was hoping to find a good book with recipes for a variety of breads. This book has good explanations of techniques and ingredients. There are way too many ""artisan"" style breads like Bialys, Nan and Challah. Many recipes also use a starter. I prefer to grab ingredients off the shelf to make herb, wheat, foccacia, irish soda bread, etc. This book includes those also, but I'm afraid I paid too much for a book that didn't have many practical recipes. The sections other than breads were the same way... too time-consuming and complicated."
2,If you could only eat the pages...,"But you can't, you have to end up with an edible dessert from following these recipes and so far...NOTHING WORKS! Muffins refuse to come out of the pan, cakes don't cook all the way through and end up as glop...It's not my oven, because the desserts I've made from Pierre Herme's book have come out perfectly. Who'd ever think an Herme book would work better than a Julia Child book? I'm a little flummoxed since Ms. Greenspan was involved in both books. What gives?"
2,Disappointed,The recipes are tedious and time consuming. The results are disappointing. There are many better books available for the home baker.
3,"Great Recipes, Cheap Book","We consider this recipe collection as the essential bible of baking. It is important to follow the recipe, ingredients and especially directions closely.Although the recipes are top of the line, the book itself was cheaply published. Many of the pages have come loose from the binding after only a couple of uses. We have a Betty Crocker book from the early 70's that is still bound well, even though many pages are soiled from many ingredient spills. The Crocker book has been used many more years and times, but is still intact while this Child's book is falling apart."
5,Great book,"This book is a treasure for anyone who loves to bake. Recipes are clear and concise, perfect for the beginner, I love this book."
4,inspirational cook book,I've gone through this book many times and think about what it would be like to actually have time to bake bread. I've finally started and now think about which recipe to do next.I'd like to have a bit more detail on what the dough should look like when it comes to certain stages in the mixer. I'm now looking for the videos to see if those will have the answer.
4,Fantastic but not completely comprehensive,"While those of us who have a bookcase of cookbooks know that other Julia Child books have necessary information (such as measurements), those who wanted a comprehensive cookbook should not rely on this book alone. However, with that said, this book has some of the most creative, tasty baked products I have seen. The Tourte Milanaise is my particular favorite. It says to serve it room temperature or cold but I would recommend cutting it and then warming it again. The cheese and tarragon in the eggs comes out when warm and you miss it when it is chilled. What a delight though. I recommend this book for anyone who loves to bake and anyone who loves Julia Child!"
5,An inclusive book for bakers,"I bought this book when I bought a new mixer. And I bought it primarily for the bread recipes. Yes, some of the recipes are complicated and labor intensive, but of those I've tried they are definitely worth the work. I have been impressed by the list of contributors and the quality of the recipes. I've made the Classic French Bread a standard part of my baking repetoire (when I served it at a dinner a friend said he didn't know we had a bakery nearby). It's definitely for those who enjoy baking and who aren't afraid of the work involved. If you are up for it, you won't be disappointed in the results. (Unlike some of the others, I have not had trouble with the recipes not working as they should.)"
5,Beautifully presented,"'Baking with Julia' is just a book that must be owned by all baking-enthusiasts because of its concise directions, it's beautiful pictures, and the satisfaction of sharing the completed products with friends and family. There is something for everyone, and a basis for anyone to build off of. The book covers recipes from the simplest Irish Soda Bread (which is delicious nonetheless) to much more elaborate pastries and breads. What slightly disappointed me upon first opening the book was the presence of a heavy-duty mixture in almost every recipe. I still don't have my mixture, but I have completed many recipes successfully by hand (it's a great workout).I am delighted that all of the recipes that I have tried have turned out so succesfully. I definitely recommend this book to everyone."
3,"Excellent content, terrible binding","This is one of my most-used cookbooks (and it has been for nearly 10 years). The recipes are very reliable and refreshingly diverse. Unfortunately, just weeks after I received this book (new) as a wedding gift, the binding completely fell apart. The glue must have been cheap, leaving me with a collection of loose-leaf pages (or sometimes clumps of 10 or so pages), which I carefully stuff back into the cover after use. I sent a letter of complaint to the publisher and never received a response. Since I continue to use the book often, I intend to have it professionally repaired, but I'm cringing at the thought that a new binding might cost more than the original price of the book! (And I'm certainly not going to just buy a new copy, only to have it fall apart again.)"
1,I wouldn't want Van Dalen as a teacher !!!,"Terrible layout : paragraphs, concepts, titles, definitions, theorems... are all dumped in, indiscriminately.More fundamentally, Van Dalen skips a lot of necessary explanations and some of his statements are ambiguous, confused, confusing as he attempts to relieve the reader from the difficulties of over-formalization found in other authors of logic indigestions such as Enderton and Mendelson : so we fall from Charybdis into Scylla !!!I stopped losing my time with this book and turned to Kleene's beautiful and masterful achievements ""Introduction to Metamathematics"" and ""Mathemathical Logic"" (see my reviews)."
4,Soft Sheep,This is the cutest and softest little sheep. It has weighted beads in it's paws and sits nicely on your shoulder. Any child would love this -- or any adult that still appreciates something cuddly. I do wish I had gotten the larger size though.
5,Terrific scenes of Dorothy,This movie has terrific scenes of Dorothy when she was alive taken at many Playboy functions. (It also has video of the real Paul Schneider) I recommend it to anyone who liked Star 80 but wanted the real story. Seller was great too.
4,A fine basic history of the BUFF,"I found this book fascinating, especially the chapter having to do with the island of Guam. I was a B-52 crew chief for approximately 12 years and I have stood on Pati's Point and looked across Andersen's flight line at the forest of B-52D ""tall tails"". I simply couldn't put it down until the end. We, my wife and I, did find several errors in the book, but to the novice/civilian reading it they are of no consequence as they concern the organizations and not the plane. I also am a member of the B-52 Stratofortress Association."
3,Calming,"Check it out...for a guy like me whom in to hardcore and grunge music, the first time i played this cd...which is my sis's, i was really surprised by the music...it was totally calming and inspiring...to those out there who need to relax and get a grip or start with a new begining...START OUT WITH THIS CD!"
3,Cuisinart red toaster,"The only thing that was disappointing was the brightness of the toaster, I wanted a metallic look. It works great just keep it in my cabinet"
2,"Maybe it is just me, but........","To begin, I would tell you not to buy this if you think you are getting a ""compact"" toaster, as that it is not. Otherwise, it is a nice looking unit and browns the bread evenly.However, if it is crispy ""toast"" that you are after, this ""toaster"" will disappoint you. What the Cuisinart CPT-120R produces is actually ""hot, browned"" bread. Not crispy toast. As much as I want to like this thing, I just cannot get used to the texture of the end product.Hopefully, this device will die as quickly as my previous Krups toaster."
2,"Pretty, but damaged.","This toaster is very pretty, lovely bright red, and the controls appear to be user-friendly. The only problem was that upon removing it from its inner carton I discovered that the Carriage Control Lever had broken off from its mooring and nothing I could do would fasten it back on. I suppose I could have rigged up a solution, but when buying an appliance I expect it to be customer-ready, so regretfully decided that I couldn't accept it. I was sad to have to send back such a good-looking appliance because otherwise I think I might have loved it."
4,Red toaster,The Cuisnart Red Toaster would have been a good buy at the original price. At the delivered price it is a fantastic help in this depression!
5,Cuisinart CPT-120R Electronic Cool Touch 2-Slice,"This is the best toaster I have ever owned. It is fast, accurate and easy to use and I love the color. It is a great value."
1,Nice design & attractive features -- but electronics sure got toasted,"This toaster worked great for over a month, yielding evenly browned slices; the defrost feature was particularly useful. But after 2-3 months the 'browning' dial suddenly stopped functioning so that - even at the lowest setting - the bread would keep on toasting till it turned black and smoky, and even then kept going till unplugged. After a few fire alarms, we just unplugged it. Then the 'Bagel' light came on uninvited and could not be turned off - yet without browning one side only. Not worth the hassle going thru warranty -- we're buying different make; are any still made in the USA??"
4,Red Fattie,"Very pleased with the new toaster so far; wish it wasn't so ""fat"" on my counter, but it is eye-pleasing, light weight and fairly quiet; the only disappointment for me was that the english muffins, for example, do not pop up high enough to grab them without having to ""go in"" and burning your fingers if you are not careful; ""they"" had said that this particular model had a higher ""carriage"" so this would not happen, but it does.Otherwise, great little fat red bug.Price was excellent with no shipping fees or tax from Amazon."
4,Awesome feat of bread burning technology,"Hard to know what I enjoy most - the compact design, lipstick red chassis, LED-lit numbering system, bagel option, wide slots, the ability to actually make it release my bread before it's done . .No, wait. IT'S THE PRICE. (-'"
3,Feels cheap,"It's Cuisinart, but it feels cheap. It feels like it's on the line between Fisher Price and a toaster that actually warms bread. $30? Not terrible"
1,Not red,"I do not like the color. it should be red, but what you get is a pink shade of red. Ugly!!! I have a collection of red appliences and this one just ruins it. unfortunately i have to look at it.:(((( I do not recommend it if you are looking for Red toasters."
2,Burnt Toast,"This is a very shiny toaster, BUT it burns my toast. No matter what number I choose, it just randomly burns it whenever it feels like it. Sometimes, I think it is in a bad mood. When we first got it, it worked very well. The toast is still GOOD, but you don't have to take my word for it."
1,Dissappointing,"After taking nearly three weeks to get (just simply didn't ship for the first week and a half), it just doesn't seem worth the wait. The first cycle made a terrible plastic burning odor. it also burned the toast. I didn't think it was odd, i had it set at the halfway mark and just thought it needed to be turned down. Not that that made any difference. I ejected the next attempt before the cycle completed and got my just overdone toast.My wife let me know a day or two later that even on the lightest setting that it would still burn.We returned it, got a replacement within a week.On the lowest setting, it was still overdone. We gave it a week and it never got better. The Kitchenaid we bought to replace it doesn't have all the buttons and settings, but at least the ones it does have work."
1,Cute but not made well,This toaster worked great for about a year. Ran a little hot but useable. One day the lever just stopped holding the toast down. We opened it up to see if it was something simple and found that most of the operating mechanisms inside were made of flimsy plastic. We never did find the reason for the lever not working. I wouldn't waste my money on this. It just isn't well made.
2,Garbage,"I've owned this toaster for a couple of years. It has broken twice, toasts unevenly and is very poorly made. Would not recommend."
1,Crispy Toast?,"This cute little number looked like a great Christmas gift for my mother-in-law who saw red as her new kitchen color for 2008.Mama loves her toast in the morning and her first try at setting 3 proved fatal for the bread. At setting 1, the bread was still over toasted.Thank you Amazon for the prompt replacement at no charge. But the latest report from Mother is that the replacement toaster isn't much better. Another return is in the offing. Time to shop for another brand I guess."
4,Good little red toaster,"Have had the toaster about 5 weeks. Makes toast just fine. The backlit psuedo-digital readout seems out of place on a retro styled appliance, but it is small enough that it's not gawdy. The toast is not restaurant quality, but neither is the price. If you want a bright red toaster that makes consistent decent quality toast, bagels, etc., this is a good choice. It is another solid performing small appliance from Cuisinart."
5,Awsome Soundtrack! Quick Delivery! Get Up And Buy It Now!!!!,"I've Heard Many Disney Soundtracks, But ""The Adventures Of The Great Mouse Detective""Is One Of The Most Fantastic!!!! I Love This Movie So Much, And Now I Love The Soundtrack So Much!! I'm Only 12, And I Still Think This Movie And Soundtrack Is Awsome!! My Favorite Is The ""Big Ben Chase"", This One Is When Ratigan And Basil Are On The Big Ben Clock Tower And They're Battling!! Half Of Why I Like This Film Is Because Of The Music.This Is A Very ""Great"" Soundtrack,And If Your A Fan Of ""The Great Mouse Detective"",You Should Buy This Soundtrack!!! YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT!!!!!!!!"
4,great resource,R&M is a great resource if you are interested in learning more about the biological aspects of weastewater engineering.
3,Review of Tea pot,"The good thing about this tea pot is that it has a generous 6 cup capacity . But there are substantial deficiencies.The spout drips , so one has to take care while pouring to avoid a spill which is hard. The china itself is utilitarian and robust , what I would expect for use in a commercial facility. But lacks refinement. Made in China where it probably costs a fifth of its price here."
5,Gil Elvgren: All His Glamorous American Pin-Ups,"Wonderful picture book, many ""suitable for framing."" There is something charming about these pinups from another era, not at all sleazy."
5,The best collection of works by the best pinup artist ever,"Gil Elvgren is by far the best pinup artist of all the pinup artists. Just compare his art to some other pinup artists. Put them next to each other and you will see that Elvgren is the best. This book is the best collection of Elvgren's art to date. It collects nearly all of his art in categorical order. The only complaint is the size of some of the art reproduced is quite small -- maybe too small to appreciate properly -- but nonetheless, it is the definitive Elvgren pinup collection."
5,Smoothes without hurting.,This file works really well at smoothing the bottom of my feet without being too rough. Just remember that moisturizer of some kind must be used to keep the softness!
2,I know I'm the first person to rate this less than 5 stars...,"I guess I was under the impression that this was one of those metal type foot files that sort of 'grate' your feet. It's my dumb fault for reading the description wrong.... but for someone who really wants the callous gone, this will do minimal work. The salons use a grater type foot file on me and it took me forever to find one but I did... the one I got is like the ones you see in a real spa. This tool would be a good compliment to the metal file but it doesn't do the entire job on its own"
5,LOVE IT!,"I bought this devo for my son, perfect to do before school! It has practical important life lessons. Definately recommend!"
4,Fitting farewell for MI,"I can't believe this is the first review of the final album by the happy-pop kings Material Issue. For those who need a review, guitarist and lead singer of MI, Jim Ellison killed himself over 4 years ago, and to me it's still a loss because MI represented quick catchy pop-rock tunes, girl's name love songs and true romance in 3 minute bursts of music. And so in 1998, the 2 remaning members of MI re-worked and completed the songs that were to be the next album, and as a bonus to fans re-released the initial EP that sprung the band to indie-stardom. And so what you get with this disc is 11 tracks that is a new album and 7 tracks of remastered old tunes, quite a bargain. If you're wondering about the music that didn't change over 4 albums, quick catchy rock tunes about love and loss, and Jim Ellison's clear passionate voice echoing over his guitar work. This and the 3 other MI discs are recommended for the true rock and roll fan."
2,"I like ""Here I Am"" other than that - thumbs down!!","What a lousy cd. I really like ""Here I Am"" but don't waste your money on this cd for that song. Just get it off itunes. I really liked their older cd, those were good. This one sucks. Boo for making a corporate rock cd."
3,"haha, susie q is funny!","whoever wrote that about susie q its pretty funny. it got me laughing quite a bit. And all the things he said are true, I actually got quite the belly laugh. Hey, here's an idea: lets turn this area into a forum where we discuss how STUPID susie q is! Anyone with me? Ill start: Susie Q,We laugh at You!"
2,Somewhat outdated.,"I felt a lot of this book was a waste of my time. I skipped over a lot because it doesn't really apply any more. I bought it through a dive shop for an equipment specialist course sight unseen, without knowing the title. I thought it was a PADI manual and paid 21.99 for it. They mailed it to me, and when I looked it up on Amazon I found copies for a penny! Almost cried! Wouldn't be so bad if it were a fresh, current manual. I kept waiting for Lloyd Bridges to pop up. I did learn a couple of things I had never been told during my training."
1,Don't Buy It,Too many other decent devices out there. Motorola tech support made a half-hearted effort at troubleshooting and then mysteriously hung up on me. I'm giving the worthless device to my 9YO as a toy and getting a real bluetooth headset from a company likely to be in business next year.HelloMOTO? Nah. AdiosMoto.
2,Didn't Last Long,"I bought this headset about six months ago and it stopped working totally. The battery life is very low. It worked okay while it was working, but I could only use it for local calls. No one could understand me if I called someone 100+ miles away. I would not recommend this or get one of these again."
4,"Good, small, headset","I let my wife try my headset and liked it so much we bought one for her. What I like about it: It's small, very light, and has a low profile on the ear. The best feature we like is to to turn on and off the bluetooth with the switchblade like boom. Powering it on or off with a single flip motion was more useful than we thought. The call and volume up or down buttons are easy to use. Sound is clear, no problems. Drawbacks: It's small so I have a tendancy to put it in my pocket, which at times, presses against the call button causing it to enter 'discovery mode'. Easy to lose / misplace this device if you're not carful with it. When on the ear, it doesn't always fit super snug. So when driving, I turn my head to check for traffic, the device moves a bit, but doesn't fly off either. Overall, a good bluetooth headset. I'd buy another one if I needed it."
1,static static static motorola h700,the title says it all. i had to return the headset motorola 700 after 2 days. got the plantronics 510 instead. nothing to compare. the plantronics is so good. nobody even asks me if i am on a headset or cell.
4,the packaging is weird!!,i just got my headset today...and ill have to admit...i love it!!! my house only gets reception in very few places and it allows me to walk around my house or atleast my room without losing a call...the only complaint i have is that the package looks nothing like an authentic motorola package...which begs the question...is it a counterfeit?? i think it very well might be...but i have no idea...it works well...the sound quality is good...it comes with a wall charger and a car charger...no one has complained they cant hear me... it is light and comfortable...and costs way less than buying directly from motorola!!! So whats not like??
3,Not quite there,Returned a H850 for this newer model (H700) with a smaller size- big mistake. The H850 worked perfect- clear and strong. This unit very frequently develops static or other disturbances that make the call quality very poor.
2,A big dissapointment...,"I chose this product because I used a previous BT Headset from Motorola of the same general design (I believe it was the HS850). It is smaller and fits in my pocket better. It is louder than the previous model that I had, which is better in a slightly noisy environment. I do like the ability to turn the device on and off by opening and closing the boom. This facilitates easier use in a mobile environment.Unfortunately, I have a lot more people now telling me that my audio is horrible and very noisy. I hardly use it because I have to keep shutting it off and return to using the handset itself. I guess newer models aren't always better.I don't recommend this product unless you are in a quiet setting."
1,nice garbage....literally,paired with my phone nicely...dealt with the bluetooth induced static....very sensitive to wind...okay...then it just ...stopped working.charger? nothing. beating it? nothing. just died after like a month of use.never again.
3,"Great headset, poor technology","This headset is very light and comfortable. Great ergonomics, the functions work great, especially paired with the Razr, also uses the same charger which is nice. The sound is clear sometimes, somtimes people ask me if I'm on a speakerphone, and sometimes people tell me we have a terrible connection. I notice this picks up static from my PC and also when driving the reception can be bad, must be picking up interference from the car.I think most of the reception problem is just bluetooth technology in general. I never had any of the reception problems that I have with bluetooth when I use a wired headset. I heard a national radio computer guy say he gave up on bluetooth headsets, the technology is just not very good for that application."
1,It sucks,"The quick guide says that you can answer a call by either opening the boom or pressing the call button if the boom is open, but you can't answer a call by opening the boom. Atleast that hasn't worked for me. It should work as a flip which it doesn't. What is the point of having the boom feature then. I think it doesn't adjuct to the ear very well. I'm scared it's going to fall off if I lean over. I think it's too much money for what you get."
1,The headset is fake,The product I bought from this store is fake. Delivering to me without package. This store sucks.
1,An unhappy camper,"I purchased this product from the AbsoluteTrading ebay store. Upon receipt of the product I was able to link it to my phone easily and quickly. Then my problems started. The volume control button was compressed such that it was nonfunctional. I received defective merchandise. I then followed the return merchandise procedures, filled out the form, and mailed back the product. I have not received a replacement and have been forced to file a claim with eBay. Hopefully that process will work."
1,First Bluetooth a Disaster,"The H700 was my first step into BT headsets. Setup was easy, as was pairing up to my Motorola Razor. Thats where the good stops. The trim piece on the boom came loose after one use. The fit is lousy, it balances on your ear at best. It fits loosly and always feels like it's going to fall off. The first call I made with it was a nightmare. I had to take it off, redial the number and talk on the handset. I would NOT recommend this device."
1,Not Impressed With Amazon Products,I loved the product for about 1 week before it stopped working and I had to pay $12.00 to ship it to Motorola for a replacement. So much for finding a great deal with super saver shipping on Amazon. The $11.00 I spent in shipping back a non-functioning product took care of that savings.
1,Returned,I returned it without opening the package. I actuallycancelled the order prior to shipment but I could not reach a live person by phone at the seller. They ignored the email that I sent and shipped anyway.
1,not highly recommended,This little headset is probably not a good idea if your very active. The reception was poor and volume level wasn't too good.
3,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset (Retail Packaged),Bought 2 Headsets and both of them had problems with the button not working. Had to call Motorola and they are in the process of replacing both of them.
3,Great Features...unless you want a clear conversation....,"I had been waiting for months to get a Bluetooth headset, and the guy at the store that I bought it at said that this was the top of the line. I got it home and charged it up, it paired up perfectly with my phone, and then...major disappointment.This unit is increadibly comfortable and light...but as soon as I got about 3 feet away from it there was so much static that I couldn't hear anything at all. In fact, even if I had my phone in my pocket, or next to me in the car when I sat down I still got major static. I took it back and got a Samsung WEP200 which works wonderfully - check that one out if this one isn't doing it for you..."
3,Motorola H700 Bluetooth,"This product is comparable to most other less expensive bluetooths. I like its design and battery life, but am not especially pleased with the reception and range. Beyond two feet the reception had an extreme amount of static. I have mine connected to the Palm 700p (PDA-motorola). This model may work better with another brand of phone. The Palm 700p is an extremely temperamental piece of equipment(JUNK). I would how ever give the H700 another go if I lost my present one..."
3,H700 Bluetooth,"While it was to be ""retailed packaged""; that was not the case. The bluetooth device arrived in a little plastic bag, not the packaging I had seen at several stores. As far as the device itself, I am a woman and have small to average sized ears, and I find it does not feel secure on my head. I have used it very little feeling like I have to constantly check to see if it is still there. The reception is not as good as my phone."
4,Excellent Bluetooth Device,"Not a bad Bluetooth device. Automatically turns on when the microphone is unfolded and enabling Bluetooth was fast and easy. The only reason I don't give this device 5 stars is that I wish I could enable it to hear music from my smartphone. In some cases there are workarounds which allow the H700 to be able to receive music from cell phones, but I haven't found any software which allows me to hear music from my Treo 700W."
3,Not for use with Macs,"If I were using this just with a cell phone, it would be great, but it will not stay connected to my MacBook. Once it cycles into low-power mode, it becomes invisible to the MacBook and will not reconnect without a re-install."
2,"razor friendly, palm enemy","Used same headset for the Razor and worked well and is less than well with the Palm Treo. Sets up in no time but you have no functions other than answer, which is very selective in its operation, and end call, which usually happpens when trying to answer. You can do voice calling but it is such an effort that it is not worth the trouble. Now works as dust collector in vehicle."
1,Buyer Beware of the H700... Run the other way!,"This ""compact, lightweight"" (the only thing it has going for it, thought it doesn't particularily fit my ear) item has been nothing but trouble since I bought it. I can hear everyone just fine...that is, when it doesn't drop the call. However, no one can understand me! Everyone say they can hear static and I sound like I'm talking through a tin can! I took my first one back to Sprint (and yes I paid an overly inflated price for it out of ignorance) and exchanged it. The jacka** manager claimed he couldn't set my new one up with the instructions that came with it. So, I took it home and paired it with my Treo without a hitch, and without fail it DOESN'T WORK! It worked for a whole 30 seconds and then...it dropped my calls AGAIN! It says it's paired, but it's just o P.O.S! So, tomorrow I will take this one back, get a full refund on this and save my money for something that wasn't designed by a monkey in a space suit!"
1,Hard to work,My product connest easily but there is a lot of static and my device constantly looses signal with my phone. I think I may have recieved a bad bluetooth device.
2,Style without substance,"I picked this up about a month ago to accompany my PPC 6700. After oohing and aahing when I first held it, I charged it and took it for a spin. It is not even worth the turn people. The lousy audio quality is my first gripe, if you can barely hear it at full volume when you are in a quiet living room you can forget about using it when you drive. Couple that trait with the way the headset will dip in audio quality when the power gets anywhere near 25% and start dropping calls long before it runs out of charge makes this less than desirable for road warriors or anyone who doesn't regular intervals to charge during the course of a day.In the end, it looks shiny and pretty but it may as well be stuffed with shreds of exotic silk -- expensive and useless."
1,Beware of Counterfeit,"At first, I thought that maybe this model of Motorola was cheap, but then I heard that there are counterfeits out there and so I learned more about that. I found out that the bluetooth i was sold was a COUNTERFEIT! It is really hard to tell though, you have to pay very close attention. It doesn't have the same quality as the original models do. It sounds staticy and metallic. Beware of the cheap priced ones those are the counterfeits."
2,Underwhelming,"In its favor, it does hold a charge for quite some time.However, it's uncomfortable and the volume doesn't go up very high. The volume is adequate for someone who is sitting still in a quiet room- but what is the point of the device at all if that's the only way it can effectively be used?"
3,Extremely Disappointed,"Love the battery life, look and size, but have found the sound inferior to my bottom-of-the-line HS 805. Frequent static.And then the topper--whenever it is on, the blue light on the side blinks. The instructions say that this stops after five minutes, or that it can be disabled by holding the two volume buttons. Both are lies. Maybe some twenty-something year old designer thought it was way cool to walk around with a big blinking LED on the side of your head, but I can't use this in a business setting. It's going back."
2,Static and pairing problems,I am experiencing intermittan static and problems pairing this device. It's maddening... Motorla has lousy customer service and I can't find any warranty information. Form over function.
2,Disappointed,"Fit snugly on my ear,becomes unconfortable after about 30min of wear. Volume in earpiece was low. No one could hear me clearly, and connectivity to my Treo 650 kept dropping. I dont know if that is because of the phone or not. Overall I would not recommend this product. The search for a good bluetooth headset continues!"
2,Poor reception with Treo 700,"I've now tried 2 different H700's with my Treo 700. The signal has a great deal of ""crackle"" in it even when my phone is on my belt holster. I'm trying the Treo bluetooth headset next."
3,Didn't fit me,The electronic parts worked fine; it sync'd fine and sounded alright. I just didn't like the way it fit on my ear. It didn't feel stable or secure. I have the same problem with my headset with a similar ear pattern at work.
4,Cheap and effective,"I bought an earlier version of this product with less than stellar results, but the newer version seems to be working great. Easy to use and setup both on my mac and cell."
5,One of the Best!,I love this bluetooth. It fits really snug on the ear and is highly recommend for those on the go. My job requires alot of lifting and moving around and this bluetooth doesn't even budge. I would and am recommending this bluetooth to all my friends and family. Its size is also very good.
3,Eh!,"It might be my cell phone that's the problem -- a Treo 650 that has given me problems before -- but, the headset works great... sounds great... cuts noise great... but after about 5-10 minutes of inactivity it seems to go into some kind of ""suspend"" mode. I can't answer a call -- and I have to close the boom and reopen it to get it to come back to life... I'm getting a new phone in a couple weeks, so I'll hold on to see if it continues to give me problems."
1,Not pleased,"This Bluetooth has not worked at all well since I got it. Often, I cannot pick up voice mail message because of all the static in the earpiece, and when I am on a call, at some point during the call, static get so loud the other person cannot hear me, so I have to switch off the Bluetooth and call the person back.I had an earlier version of the Motorola Bluetooth, and that one was never this bad!"
1,"Terrible performance, static, can't hear other party","This was my first bluetooth headset for my Blackberry Pearl and I was very disappointed. Pairing was okay and device itself seems fine as far as fit and looks go. Performance matters the most though and in that area it faltered. I couldn't hear anyone else who was talking to me and that was with volume turned all the way up, only if you were in a library could you hear their voice. In a quite office you couldn't hear the other party. On top of that there was lots of static. So I've returned it and just ordered a BlueAnt and pray that it gives me acceptable performance."
1,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset,"This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone. I tried two of these and both would not work. I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure."
3,Needs Work,"Works okay, Does not fit in my ear just perfect. Sometimes there is static. Works okay but not great."
3,Super small but too much static,"I returned this product because of the excessive static and low volume. Callers couldn't hear me well, nor could I them. I ended up getting the Jawbone Aliph, which is sigificantly heavier, but at least everyone can hear me, there is no more static, and I can hear my callers with reasonable ambient noise levels. I have a blackberry 8830, maybe that's the problem here, but I've found the Moto Bluetooth devices to lack when using with my other previous phones.. . ."
2,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset,I used the headset only a few times and it broke. The prongs on the inside broke and cannot be charged.Not very happy with this product unless it was just a bad product. I would not buy another.
5,Great product to use!,I purchased this product and have been very happy with its performance since I received it. The earpiece is very comfy to wear and works very well. This is also the cheapest I have seen this product.
5,Works great.,I have had one for over a year and it has always worked fine. Good reception and very dependable.
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I would never buy another one...mic is too sensative, creating too much background noise for the other party...I can't answer a call in my car with the AC running...The backgound fan noise drowns out my voice, I've been told...It's constantly synching and unsynching with my phone. The other problem with Motorola bluetooths is the black market...There are many fake Motorola bluetooths being sold on line and at ""reputable"" cell phone stores...The quality is inferior to genuine Motorola...the problem is that no one can tell them apart...My advice is to stay away from this one."
2,poor mic,"Paired this with my motorola krzr, people I talked to always seemed to have trouble hearing me, or heard a lot of background noise. Dont know if its the headset or the phone, but would not buy this again."
4,Handy little gadget to have,"I really like this headset - a lot. It is really great to be able to get a call while I am at a job and still be able to keep working. It is also great when I am vacuuming and can't hear the phone ring, but I can hear the little beep in my ear. It is nice while shopping or at a restaurant, if you don't mind people looking at you funny for talking to yourself. It doesn't seem to be able to go very far from the phone, though. But we are in a rural area with fairly poor reception, so don't let that deter you. I would recommend this Bluetooth headset to anyone looking for one."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this item to go woth my new Krzr phone. I got it because it got good reviews & I thought a ""new on the market"" bluetooth would be the best. I loved how it synced to my phone. It came on when the boom was opened & off when the boom was closed. It was also very comfortable.Unfortunately,as soon as my husband asked me to speak up, that I sounded ""muffled"" I immediately got concerned, & with good reason. Soon my friends were telling me they thought someting was wrong with THEIR phones, because they couldn't understand me. As soon as I turned off the bluetooth & spoke on the phone, the sound problem cleared up. I had to return it, & now I'm back to researching a better Bluetooth."
1,CHEAP PIECE OF ****,Bought two of these bluetooth headsets on the recomendation of my local celluar rep. I have to agree word for word with Krause that these headsets are a piece of P.O.S. They drop calls constantly and everyone you call say you sound muted. My son-in-law had the same problem with his so I know it is not just my Moto V551 phone if it does the same with a Moto Razor.My best advise is to stick with the last H series that came out I have 3 of them and they work just fine.
2,It is just ok,"I have a simple test when it comes to Bluetooth Headsets, before I will try to have a conversation with a client I first call my 100 Year Old Grandfather. If GrandPa can hear me and we can have a conversation then it is client ready. We call it the GrandPa seal of approval and sadly this headset did not pass the test. After about five minutes of, what did you say and Nope can't understand you; we throw in the towel and just used the cell phone sans headset.I hear good things about the Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology so we are going to try that next"
2,Not what I expected.,"The product is better than the one I had... But it doesn't add up to what is advertised on the lable. It lists that I would be able to speak and hear from accross the room. On the packedge it lists 30ft. I haven't been able to talk or communicate with anyone beyond a 1 (one) foot range with out a hole lot of static and the loss of connection. Its been paired and it is recognized by my Phone unit. It's not what it says it is. I am linked to a Pocket PC and I shouldn't have this kind of problem. There are times when I receive static just between my right ear and my leftside belt holster (My waist)... Not good. If I didn't have a real need to use it at this time, I would return it... But for the most part it does work on the same side the Phone unit is. (both on the right or left side one on the ear and the other on my hip[belt])"
3,"ok,need improvment.","this a nice small earphone device,however it dosen't work as good as it should.on the description of the product it says that it should work from up to 30 feet from the phone and that is a lie.it hardly work somtime from five to ten feet from the phone.also it kind of cut off somtime from the phone while in the middle of the conversation even when the phone is in your pocket.i like it but i wish it works a little better."
3,not that great,"poor sound quality, sometimes the person on the other line says it sounds like I'm talking on speaker phone or as if I'm far away from the headset.pros - great size, nice looking, easy to use boom mic."
2,Average no better,I dont see it a lot of people loved this item. I thought that reception was spotty and you really couldnt hear much I used it for a couple of weeks then it sat until I sold it on a auction site for $20 just to get rid of it.
2,Not too impressed,bought the bluetooth headset but ended up not using it. Noisy and not too easy to use. Hardly can hear the other person on the other end.
4,Activates even when closed,"Don't get me wrong, it functions very well. It has a clear sound it is clearer than the built-in speaker in the phone.The only drawback I've found in it is that sometimes even when you got it closed if the button is pressed it conects with the phone and dials the last number called. This has cost me a lot of airtime."
2,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset,"I am very happy with the H700 Bluetooth headset. It is very comfortable when wearing it. Call are very clear when sending or receiving them. I really like the alert to a phone call coming in, especially when the radio is on. I highly recommend this product."
2,"Looks AMAZING, works HORRIBLY","i just purchased this headset 2 weeks ago after eagerly waiting for it for months when motorola hyped it up nearly 6 months back. i was even on their ""notify me when it comes out"" list. i have a motorola e-815 phone, and this headset annoyed the heck out of anyone i was talking to on the other end (static, mumbly sound, etc). it's awesome for it's flip mic style, etc etc, but it sucks. trust me...if a motorola phone gets static with a motorola headset, you're not gonna have too much luck with it if you use another phone. i usually try to see the good in things, but i've just been severely disappointed by this one. sorry to those of you who were eagerly waiting to purchase this headset, as i was. i returned mine to BB yesterday."
2,Looks cool works terible,"I have used almost every headset in the last week and the H700 looks better then any onther headset on the market but sounds the worst. I had static when my motorola v551 was in my pocket. Also had complaints of an echo on the other end. Went to the Plantronics Voyager 510, the best I found at least."
3,Motorola H700,"I read many of the other reviews before purchasing and felt adequately assured that it would work fine. and, as this has been only my first earpiece, I really have nothing else to compare it with. It works fine, although my wife doesn't care for how ""loud"" it is on her end. I have found that I can't really be outside with any desent wind or inside the car w/ radio on, or eating chips, or the person on the other end has a hard time hearing/understanding me.All that said, it serves the purpose I purchased it for....to drive with both hands."
2,Nowhere near as good as the description,I returned this product after two days. I had great difficulty getting the bluetooth to pair with my Treo 650 and the flip up mic feature was clunky while wearing the headset. You can do better.
4,good headset,I like this headset. It is very comfortable and lightweight. Stays on fine when adjusted properly. The volume is great. Callers say they can hear me fine without noise interference. What I like best is You can close it to turn it off an open it and it automatically reconnects. You can answer call waiting with this too. Also I haven't had it randomly disconnect as I turn my head as my other one did. I don't know about battery life yet as i only have had it 3 days.
4,Excellent sound quality,"This is an awesome unit. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the mouth piece closes towards your face, which makes it awkward to open and close while it is on your ear. Too bad they didn't make it so it opened and closed on the outside of the unit. Other than that, I highly recommend it."
5,Small but POWERFUL!,"This is the second Bluetooth Headset I've owned and my first Motorola H700. I love its simplicity. It's small,comfortable, discreet and easy to use. The features on this headset are the reason I purchased it and I recommend it highly."
1,Wouldn't use it if they paid me!,"The BT headset was such a disapoinment. After buying a ""cheap"" model that was less than impressive, I decided to go with the name I knew and trusted (past tense) Motorola. After receiving my sexy looking new H700, I was surprised that I could not hear people clearly, nor could anyone hear me- and BT is supposed to work for up to 30 feet (or so) from the source, but if the phone was more than 2 feet, the signal started to degrade worse that it already was. Thank God that Amazon makes returning sub-standard products very easy. I will continue to use Amazon, but Motorola is off my list for BT headsets (and possibly products alltogether)."
2,I would stay away if I were you...,I purchased this item based on the reviews... But I have to say I was looking forward to this product.. But I am very disappointed in the ability to produce a clear call. If I am in a room with dead silence it works well.. The minute there is any background noise people say that I sound muffled/muddy sound. I tried other bluetooth products and so far I found that some jabra products produce better audio quality with some background noise (i guess some kind of noise cancellation) I would not recommend this product to anyone.. I gave it 2 stars because it does work well when you are in a silent room.. but thats not the case when you are on a cell phone.. Hopefully this was helpfull to others.
2,Not worth the money,"Cheaply constructed, it falls apart when just opening the microphone. It seems to drain the battery within 24 hours, even when it's turned off. Sound quality, in terms of the speaker, was good, but the microphone picks up a lot of background noise. It does fit on the ear comfortably, but if it connects to the wrong device, then I have to look online to find instructions on how to properly reset the connection. There were no instructions for this."
5,The best mini headset,"This small Bluetooth Headset is the best I have used. I am on my second one since I wore the original out that I bought when it was first introduced. It is very small when closed and is easy to use and carry with you and also link to your bluetooth phone. Very few people know I am speaking using the set and it is not intrusive looking like many of the other gigantor head sets. Great buy at Amazon and great headset, very discreet."
1,Very unhappy,"We bought two of these. One for a Treo 700wx and one for a Blackberry. It wouldn't even pair properly with the blackberry, and the sound quality was terrible in anything but a completely silent room when using it with the Treo. I was very disapointed."
5,Great Product,Simple to sync with my Treo650. Very sturdy which is critical as I am very hard on equipment. My cell minutes run around 4000 minutes each month so the clarity and stability this headset has is great. It sits a bit high on the ear but I find it very comfortable as it is light. I have tried several different products and this is by far the best.
3,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset,"I feel there is a great deal of room for improvement in the bluetooth. I find it is difficult to adjust the volume loud enough for both the sender and the receiver to hear. Also, I hear static (crackling) in the earpiece."
3,Battery Problems,"This is the second of this model I have purhased. The first functioned rather well until I dropped it into the toilet so i felt ok ordering this one as a replacement. Unfortunately, the battery life for this one is EXTREMLY limited, with the unit failing to get the attention of the phone, sometimes after only an hour or so of use. I'd use caution before ordering as I don't know if this problem is specific to the one I received, or the lot."
3,Great except.... static!,"I have had my H700 for about a month now and love it except... there's annoying static when I have the phone (a Motorola Razor) not more then an arm's distance away from my body on my left side while wearing the device on my right ear. That close a range should not produce static in my opinion. I can fix this by moving the phone to my right side so that there is a clear line of sight between the phone and the H700. It's a resolvable issue but not desirable. Other than that issue, it's got great charge duration, great volume, great fit and great styling for it's size and shape. It also connects to my phone wonderfully each time I open the boom mic for use. Fix the range and the device would be perfect."
2,"Lifespan, good for about 6 mos <ave voice quality","I run a mix of LG, Blackberry and Motorola phones btween work and personal. When I first got the H700 it was a good solid connection to phone with excellent audio. After 2 months of heavy use, the Btooth connection would reset w/o warning...callers would complain about voice audio quality and battery life was horrible at 6mos. Noise cancelling was poor but the headset was rather light plus the power supply could be used to charge both phone and headset and vice a versa. Now with headset dead...at least I've got a spare phone charger out of the deal"
1,The worst,"I have the Razr phone and thought that this headset would be great to have w/ the phone. Boy was I wrong!This earpiece is the worst piece of garbage on the market. Everyone I've spoken with has asked me to use the handset because of the insane amount of feedback they hear! Not my voice; they say, their own voice. I've tested this device w/ other phones and the result is equally disappointing.Bottom line: buy somthing else."
1,Great Concept. Poor execution.,"This was a great concept. Small. Boom mike for rapid on/off. Mini-USB charging same as newer Moto phones. Sounds wonderful right? I thought so too.Which brings us to the poor execution. Well, everything is great except the reception - which is why you buy one of these things isn't it? Lots of static on both ends of a call. Back it goes."
2,make sure it's new,this headset is a pile of junk. i have another headset(850) it blows this one (700) out the water. i will not purchase nothing else from this site.
1,"if you have a razr and/or t-mobile, READ","I got this headset for my new razr that I have with t-mobile, and it's very difficult to use. First, you have to program the phone to make the headset compatible each time you turn the phone or headset on/off, by going to different options and tools on the phone. Then, each time the phone is out of range from the headset, it has to be set up all over again.It's much more trouble than it's worth. Another thing I didn't like about it is that it can only be used on your right ear and is not interchangeable. It's one redeeming quality is that it's comfortable since it doesn't go in your ear, but around your ear."
2,Looks good on paper,"This is a beautifully designed earpiece with all of the bells and whistles. It would be the perfect upgrade except that after trying out two separate headsets, I found that it does not perform as consistently as the prior model. Echoing, ambient noise interference and sound distortion were very significant. Once the bugs are worked out, this will be a great earpiece."
1,My first BT--A real POS !!!,First the instruction book was wrong about how to set the unit for pairing to my phone. Had to get on the Moto support site for proper instructions. After much wasted time I got it to pair and connect and made a test call to my wife and she reported it sounded fine. Then it disconneted from the phone and could not re-establish connection. Tried over a dozen times with both the new phone and headset fully charged. No luck. Out of disparation I reset my phone and went through all the button pushing to setup all my options and re-paired the headset. Worked for two calls and then dropped connection again. Would not re-connect again.I think I'm going to tape it to a target at the local range and send a .45 cal bullet through it. It won't work any worse and at least I'll finally get some pleasure out of my bad purchase.
1,H700 Blue Tooth,"This product does not perform. I ordered two sets (yes, 4) and got the same performance. I'm completely disappointed. Instead, for X-MAS, I went with the Samsung WEP 200 and it is great!!!! Motorola let me down!"
1,FAKE MOTOROLA HEADSET!,"While the Motorola H700 headset is a FANTASTIC headset, the headset that this seller is selling are not the real McCoy. I ordered two headsets from this seller only to get them and find out that neither headset worked properly. Both produce a horrific crackling quality that none of my other Motorola H700 headsets have ever produced. I emailed the seller several times to make right on the situation only to be ignored on all occassions.With nowhere else to turn, I turned to Motorola's warranty department. Unfortunatly according to Motorola these are not authentic Motorola products so they are not covered by warranty.If possible avoid this ""OEM"" headset and seller at all cost. It might be inexpensive but trust me, the extra couple of bucks for a working bluetooth headset is worth it."
3,"Good Interface, Disappointing Sound Quality","This headset looks great, feels great, is easy to control, and very convenient. But with my phone in my pocket, only three feet from my mellon, I still heard some static crackling noise. Is it really so hard to eliminate at reasonably short distances? This is like the iPod FM transmitters that also suck at point-blank range. I thought Motorola would have had this technology perfected by now.So I await vNext."
2,lacks voice quality,"My husband said I sounded muffled while using this earpiece. I've had it two days and plan on returning it tonight. I wasn't able to be understood while on it. Also, when others were talking to me I heard a static noise in the background. I really loved my HS 850 and think I need to go back to it."
4,Great Product,"I can't give a full review since I bought this BT headset for my girl, but from my couple days of using it and her continous talking on it, I think the product works great. Can't wait to get another one."
5,A perfect handsfree solution to cell phones.,I love the fact that there are no wires attached to get tangled up or boom mikes sticking out on the side of your face. It is very discreet. The ear piece is extremely comfortable for me and a great fit. I forget I even have it on.
3,The clone wars,"I've had my H700 for almost a year now, and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE! WOAH! After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake, I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However, the headset has worked VERY well. I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset, and I ended up keeping my fake H700. Overall, it has been a very good copy, although not the real thing. Very reliable. However, I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?"
2,Mark,This headset does NOT work well with Motorola Razor phones.The reception is not god and people I called had a difficult time hearing me.I would not recommend this product.
2,crackle crackle crackle,"unless the phone is within 2 feet of the headset, all you hear is crackling, and you still hear it even when the phone is that close. I have a Treo 650. The speakerphone probably works better than this device. Very disappointing."
4,Only one con: you sound muffled,"I just recevied my h700 from amazon. It paired with my v3c perfectly, without any problems. Talking to people it is very loud i cranked it up all the way and i had to turn it down because it was too loud. I have not experienced any static what so ever, i have no idea what all these people are talking about. I put my v3c down on the table walked across my room and i could hear the person perfect, and they could hear me perfectly. I havn't ever heard static once. Maybe i have the CDMA version some people talk about but i'm not sure. My friend does tell me though that my voice sounds a little muffled but everyone has said that and its no supprise, he says its a little annoying to talk to me lol. The best way he can describe it is that i sound a lot different between using the actual handset vs the h700. So i'm not sure exactly what the means but take it however you want. Thanks and thats my little mini review, Feel free to ask questions."
1,This is my 2nd Motorola Bluetooth in less than a year,"It's not because I love them: It is because they don't last and it's easier to buy a new one than to get Motorola to honor their warranty policy. No one likes to be put on hold, especially three times. I was connected to a tech that described how to pair a bluetooth device, then I was connected to another tech who repeated the description. Wow guys, I already read the how to and had it working for a little while there...all on my own. When I told them that their quick fixes didn't work they connected me to their ""Alaska Help Center"" After twenty MORE minutes, I hung up. I bought new one March 19th. It has already gone kaput. They are light and nice when they work...."
2,Nice- except for the battery life.,"Good set. Sounds good, looks good, fits good. But only lasts about 20-30 min of talk time before you have to recharge it! That's weak. I lost mine and I won't be buying this model again."
1,Be careful charging this POS or you will damage it,"I have used mine for about six weeks now. It works well, but has a really loud, ear-piercing ""ping"" when it connects.Charging this is a joke. If you leave it on the charger for more than two hours, you risk damaging it. This was explained to me by the support people. I could not find anything on the worthless manual stating this--you would think they would put it in big, bold, red letters. Better yet, they should put a regulator on the headset or charger to prevent it in the first place. The support people said they would not cover it under warranty because I did not buy it from them.If you have one, do not leave it on the charger!"
2,NOT SO GREAT,"The Bluetooth 700, is not so great, even with a slight wind it can make it very difficult to carry a conversation. sometimes even after charging it for 3 hours, it can cut off."
3,Slick but volume on both ends a little low for high noise areas,"The look of this device is slick with its metallic finish and flip microphone. It synced up with my Pearl easy enough and supports the Pearl's voice dialing which is really cool. The problem I have with it is volume. I read reviews saying this device has very good volume, and relative to other headsets maybe it does, but this is the only one I've ever used. I bought this mainly for use in my car which is a convertable. And top up or down my car is loud. I can usually hear fine or atleast ok, but other people complain alot about the volume or clarity on their end. It's not bad, it's just ok for me."
4,motorola 700,"I like this earpiece,it works good,is compact. Holds charge for a long time. This is what I dislike, The fold up boom is hard to use while wearing,and I wish it had an earpiece that fits into ear to make it fit better."
2,too much back ground noise!,"Your in bound caller hears every warble, woosh and crackle. The sounds from inside the car if your driving. We sent one back and traded up for a Jaw Bone!"
1,did not work,the bluetooth that I purchased was no good. It did not pay to lose more money on shipping to send it back.
2,Works fine - after you perform surgery on it...,"Before you buy this headset, please know you will at some point have to take it apart and fix Motorola's mistake.I sent this to my father for Father's Day, and was pretty angry that he had to take it apart and remove a piece of rubber/foam that was blocking anyone from hearing his voice.He synced it up fine to his phone, and he was able to hear whomever he called, but they couldn't hear him - and this was brand new out of the box!This is NOT an uncommon problem with these headsets, as I quickly found on Google.However, I was SO thankful to also find a quick solution here: http://www.geocities.com/jconkwright/H700fix.htmlUnfortunately, I'm still pretty angry as my dad had to perform surgery on his own gift for it to even work.I'm only giving it 2 stars b/c it does work now. Thanks a ton Motorola."
3,H700 Review,"I tired this wireless product for two days. Set-up was very quick and simple. The sound was OK, the range on this devise was maybe ten feet before it became static. I was almost sold on the device until I walked into a Lowes and the static became bad enough that I had to switch to the handset. Bottomline, This device is OK in the car and in the open but when you go into buildings be prepared to switch back to the handset."
5,Works fine with my Samsung SYNC.,"I like the Motorola H700 because it has a hanger for around my ear and is easy to use -- close or open the boom to turn it off or on. The charger connector is great and the volume is adequate. Previous to this, I had a Motorola HS820 -- the volume was too low, the bright blue light was distracting because it reflected off of things, and the charger connector was easliy damaged. I don't like the earbud type of headsets because they fall out of my ear and I am not even aware of it (unless I am on a call). It wouldn't be long before I lost it. I use the H700 with a Samsung SYNC (SGH-A707) phone."
5,"Currently, absolutely the best.","My biggest hang up (no pun intended) is standby time. M previous bluetooth headsets neededto be recharged every few days whtrh I used it or not. Though this one has a standby time of a week or so, it will hold its charge even long when it's off. That may sound right but it does. You buy one, you'll see exactly what I mean. Also, the multicolor light and audible warnings let you knowwhen it's time to recharge. Recharge time is a couple of hours or so. In my previous life, I always found that the headset was suddenly dead when I needed it in the car."
4,good deal for the money,"I felt that this was a pretty good deal for the money. The reception is usually pretty good. My only complaint is that you can't get more than a few feet from your phone without the reception going to static. That's the reason that I did not give this 5 stars. Otherwise, it's a good product."
2,maybe I have a 'lemon',"I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'. It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable. I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better."
1,Horrible,"This bluetooth device is horrible. It's fine when you are talking in a quite room but as soon as you step outside, people can't hear you anymore.I am trying to get rid of it and I paid $99 from Verizon :("
1,disappointed,I replaced an h500 w/ the H700 and have been very disappointed. This unit has good sound but many times does not answer properly. In addition it is painful to wear for any length of time longer than 4 minutes. I hope to return this piece of junk.
5,Bluetooth H700,This is one of the best purchases I've made on-line. The H700 is a big upgrade for me (previously used the H500). No complaints whatsoever. Love the fact I can turn off the headset by just closing it. I have a small face & small ears -- this dainty piece is perfect!
2,Not prime time,"This is a replacement for a prior Motorola bluetooth headset of very similar design. I was quite pleased with the old one, until after about 2 years when it just died. That was 2 years of daily service, so not an issue. But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G, and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset, and not in the holster. The old one didn't have that problem.On the positive side, the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling, which is a good thing. They should all have that feature."
3,It picks up EVERYTHING!,"I have a LG CU 500 and the phone did not have a problem in recognizing the cell phone. However, I have a problem with the mic as it picks up EVERYY sound in the background. If you are in a quiet room, the phone is great. However, if you are in a mall or at the check out counter, you hear the background noises better than you hear the person on the phone!"
1,STLL WAITING,BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST 3 WEEKS AND HAVE NOT RECIVE ANYTHING....WHATS GOING ON .WOULD NOT HAVE GOT THIS IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IIT WAS GONNA TAKE THIS LONG
3,Motorola H700 Bluetooth,"Product was shipped with a European charger, but I was able to use the old one I have to make it work."
3,An ok headset,"This headset is passable, but not perfect. The person that you speak to can hear some static and so can you. That said, I have yet to find a headset that was perfect, so - from the ones that I sampled - this is one of the better ones."
5,Great Headset,"After doing all the research and selecting this one, I was eager to see how it would perform. It is a great headset. The sound quality is excellent for both people hearing me and me hearing people. It is light weight and DOES NOT hurt my ear when it is left on for long periods of time."
2,Very hard to hear using this headset.,It is extremely hard to hear both incoming and outgoing conversations using this headset. I usually end up taking it off to carry on a conversation to enable the person on the other end to hear me and me them.
4,Don't Know What to Rate It!,I am pleased with the item. I don't use it much because I don't use my cell often but I do like the convenience of the hands-free. It fits nicely on my ear and I have small ears which sometimes makes it difficult. After wearing it for a while it does become a little uncomfortable for me.
3,Car Charger did not work,"Headset was ok- although picture was not representing the real image, it worked. Car Charger did not even work- I am not returning because of shipping charges"
3,A lot of background noise,"Good: Fits comfortably on ear.Bad: Picks up a lot of background noise when the volume is up, but the volume doesn't go high enough to hear clearly, when in stores or when the radio is on in the car."
3,No Real Problems,"I have had this about 3- 4 months now, It was my first BT Earpiece, so I have nothing to compareit to, but so far it as been reliable, stays paired, almost always connects. I use with an A940some people have trouble hearing in windy/noisy enviornments so, I don't think noise cancelletionis all it's cranked up to be.But again, so far, it's been reliable."
3,Hoped it would have been better,Purchased from Amazon.The people on the other end complain that they cannot hear clearly at times ... I try repositioning on the ear but still sometimes forces to turn off instead.Using with Sanyo Katana get static when I keep phone in left pocket during usage so distance is not that great.
2,Not that great,"I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews, it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said, it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone, you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it."
2,hmmm,"well... it was delivered on time wasn not damaged but the product itself,how sgould i say it: very bad quality of sound, droped calls, disconect from the phone and couple other of things but it is not worth my time"
2,Keep your phone ON YOU!,"Crackle, crackle, crackle... good for a candybar, not so good on a blue tooth device, even when my phone is on my hip. At arms length, the person on the other end couldn't hear me the crackling was so bad, and I have a Treo 650 (powerful phone, I would think). This device fits me well, but I can see where you may need to have a small face and slim cheeks for it not to block the mic. I like the look and feel of it, too bad it doesn't meet the expectations it creates in advertisement (i.e., ""range of 10 meters"" apparently means less than one meter). I'll probably keep it anyway since I paid so much for it; I'll just keep the phone on me. Very disappointing."
3,Effective,"Works well except for when you are walking. There is a slight bit of static at all times which is also a bit annoying. The range is not as far as I expected (thought I would be able to use it downstairs with the phone upstairs). So, overall, good product, but it has its downsides."
2,Not Like My Old One,"I bought this bluetooth from Dbroth through Amazon. It seemed to work fine, as I have had this model before and loved it. However, I soon realized that it wasn't able to answer incoming calls by pressing the headset button. Nothing by dead silence. I emailed the seller and they assured me that they would replace it if I sent if back. Did it and got an email stating they had received it and a new one would be shipped to me. After a couple of weeks, I contacted the seller. They informed me that they had no more in stock and would refund my payment. That's fine but why are they still advertising them as ""in stock"" on Amazon. In any case, the headset was not as sturdy as my previous one, apparently."
1,Won't answer incoming calls,"Wish the product was solid as the packaging - you need a pair of heavy duty scissors to open it. As for the product, I was unable to get it to work either with a Motorola Razor or a Samsung phone. The phones recognize the headset and you can hear the audio of established calls, but it will not allow you to answer incoming calls."
1,motorola bluetooth,This is my third bluetooth all the same model..the first one I lost the second one I dropped and ran over it with my car.they were both good bluetoooth head sets this one has been nothing but trouble it drops calls and makes a wierd noise i lost my receipt because I would try for either a refund or exchange. I guess they are just making them cheaper now
5,It was a gift for my daughter.,"Her fiancee actually had this headset already, so I knew he was pleased with it before purchasing. She's had no complaints at all, loves it, and keeps it with her at all times. I knocked a homerun."
3,Love it!,"I received the first H700 and it wouldn't work right, so I returned it for the 2nd one. It worked nicely. I love the smallness of it. People do complain sometimes about the airy noises they get when I am riding my bike using it or in a crowded room. It is supposed to not pick up surrounding noises, but it does. But overall I like it, mostly for its size and features."
1,Sleek and sexy on looks falls way short on performance,I am really beginning to hate Bluetooth headsets. I read the reviews of this headset and thought I finally had found a device that would actually work and not sound like I am talking into a tin can. After using this device for 3 months now I hate it. I am pairing the headset to a Motorola RAZR and the connection rarely works well and there is a stupid bug in the headset that causes the phone to make random calls to the last person I dialed. The only way to solve this problem is to not allow the device to automatically pair to the phone when in range. What a stupid waste of time when I go to use it I have to follow the prompts on the phone to allow the device to connect then I can make a phone call. Don't waste your time (and money) with this headset
4,Works well for me!,I read a lot of reviews on a lot of headsets before purchasing this one. I've had it for a month now and so far the performance is just fine. I use it mostly in the car with no problems. People tell me they can hear me just fine. The battery life is good; the lights on the headset are helpful indicators. I like the small lightweight size.My wife tried it out and was pleased with it. So I've purchased a red one for her....she'll get it for Christmas.
2,Good when and while it works,"I bought this product exactly one year ago to use with my Razor V3. For the first six months, it generally worked just fine. I used it often for 3-hour conference calls. At about six months, the battery became odd. Maybe I wore it out. Some days, it functioned just as new. Other days, it'd run only a few minutes. Finally last night after a fresh charge, it would only run for about a minute at the time. I restarted it five times before crushing it under my boot. It now lies in several pieces in a Georgia landfill. I will replace it tomorrow, surely with a different model, perhaps with a different manufacturer."
2,Won't keep this one long,"I purchased this headset to replace an older model I had lost somewhere. The older one was a little bit larger and I thought this smaller model would be more convenient. The sound quality is poor to fair, with a lot of crackling and static type noise. And I often have to ask my callers to repeat themselves, even tho the volume on the headset is up all the way. On top of the poor sound quality, it is very uncomfortable, and I can't wear it long without having to give my ear a break. My other unit (which had a longer mouth piece - more like the HS850) was much more comfortable; in fact, I often forgot I even had it on. I'll replace this unit soon, but I'll be shopping at a phone store, where I can actually try the unit before I buy."
3,Scratchy sound,"I have a new LG 8300. Basically, as long as I sit still with the H700 it works fine. In the car it works pretty well actually. But, if I put my phone in my hand or pocket and walk around the audio is pretty much staticy and scratchy. Most annoying. I've tested this in my office, outside, and in my home. It is always bad. But again, if you just sit still it works pretty well. Dissappointing and confusing limitation of the H700. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,It works for me.,I got this so I can talk and drive. It serves its purpose well. I use it with a RAZR and the voice commands are great. Easy to use. The only problem I have run into so far is occasionally I forget it is still on my ear.
3,lot of jiggling gong on,I gave this as a birthday present for my brother in Houston - When he got the h700 bluetooth he notice that the off/on botton was loose causing a rattling sound. Other than that the headset worked ok.The problem was not so much the product is the procedure to return the item. I had given him and his wife the tracking purchase number but AMAZON refused it since it wasn't me doing the return. I had to get on line myself and do the return and mail him the Parcel Select Return Service.All I am saying is I wish AMAZON would be more return friendly next time.:)
1,Big disappointment,"I returned the headset because I was getting so much statics, and ordered the second one hoping that the first one was just a defect. But second one was also very staticky, and I ended up returning the second one also.Simply put, the quality is just not what I expected from first class company like Motorola.Very disappointed!!!!!"
2,Motorola H700 Headset Blows!,"Don't buy this headset. It is terrible. I got mine from the Verizon store, so I expect that it is OEM. In a reasonably noisy environment, this headset sounds like you are in the middle of a waterfall. The range at home is about 10-15 feet. It is definitely not worth $99. Try the knockoff $30 version if you must, but be warned."
1,Incredibly bad static,"I bought this headset from a different website after having read relatively positive reviews. The static is so bad that the headset is unusable. People on the other line say they can't hear me even when I am indoors. I went to the Verizon store today and they told me that some headsets simply don't work well with certain phones. I have the motorola razr v3c and according to the motorola website, the h700 should work with my phone. Verizon recommended the H850 so I bought one today but have not yet had a chance to test it out."
2,Good Brand but not a good product.,"I had a Motorola HS850 bluetooth headset and I liked it a lot. I used it everyday and I had no problems with it. Then after couple months I bought the Motorola H700 bluetooth headset. After using it, I found out that it is not as convenient as the Motorola HS850 because the battery charge does not last long and the connection between my phone and the headset gets lost every five or ten minutes. I bought it from the amazon store and I did not expect such a product from them. I mean the brand was good but I did not know if it was used or not. It said new when I bought it and that's why I did not like the product."
2,Bad Sound Quality,It's being used with a new LG VX8600... I've been told I sound like I'm yelling into it and it picks up every little noise background noise and amplifies x10. I've tried 3 of them so far... all the same. But it's still better than the HS850 that echoes really badly. I'm going to try a different brand.... Motorola has gone downhill the past few years (refering to their phones too)
4,Doesn't Get Along with Bluetooth Mouse,"I am happy with the headset thusfar, but when using it on my Powerbook, it does not get along with my Logitech bluetooth mouse. If I have both turned on at the same time the computer freezes up and I have no option but to shut down and restart the computer. Otherwise I am happy with the quality of the device."
2,Comfortable but poor quality for talking and listening,"Overall this one of the more comfortable headsets I've owned and I think its more stylish than most available.However, the sound quality is terrible. While talking on this you always sound like you are far away in a tunnel. It is just never as loud as talking on the phone normally; plus listening can be quite difficult, especially in the car. The headset claims to have noise cancellation, but it does not seem to make a difference. If your phone normally gets poor reception, the quality of this headset will amplify those problems both for talking and listening.I've owned 2 of these (returned the first one b/c quality was so bad) and know 2 other people with this headset; we've all had the same experiences."
2,garbled voice,"I am disappointed at the sound quality of this headset. If I turn up the volume loud enough for me to hear clearly, then my voice is garbled and full of background noise to those on the other end of the call. The only way to make my voice come across clear is to lower the earpiece volume very low.I tried Motorola support via the web, but the automatic emails I get back want the model number of the H700 - makes no sense to me.Lesson learned - I'm going back toa wired headset with a boom mic closer to my mouth."
2,so-so performance,"It works, but the static has been annoying enough that I have to switch to the handset. I haven't used any other BT headset so I cannot compare with others. I plan to return the one I bought."
1,Motorola H700,This product arrived and did not work; I ended up mailing it to Motorola in Fort Worth Texas for a replacement--7 days after receiving it. Have not received a replacement as of this date.
1,H700 is for the birds,"This unit is a piece of junk. Nobody can understand me even though I might be able to hear them fine. I've tried everything to get this thing to work properly, but nothing I do helps. It's just a pile of garbage. I bought the Plantronics Voyager 510 and LOVE IT!! Bulker, but much better."
3,"Comfortable, good sound, but mic quality for others is not great. At least for me.","I really wanted this to work. It's a great design and it's easy to use and set up. Sound quality listening is great. Sound quality speaking, for others to hear, was unacceptable. This could be because of the way it fits me, since this seems to work well for many others. If you try this out, however, it's very important to check that others actually hear you well, and not, as in my experience, too loudly and with too much low end on the sound quality. I'm returning it."
2,1 year later -- dead battery,"It was great for the first 8 months. I bought the H700 for my wife, who is in no way a super-user. With perhaps regular usage, the headset lasted a good 8 months and then the battery started weakening. It is now trash."
5,thumbs up,"works great, no prob with volume or echo issues, it couldnt work any better sync'd in seconds battery last for a week without needing recharging"
4,"Good product, would recommend","The H700 has so far been a good purchase; it easily connected to my Samsung phone, it has good volume, it's comfortable to wear, the battery life seems good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that after polling people during the first week of use, most people noted that the headset didn't sound quite as good as the phone itself - not surprising and not a problem, but it keeps it from getting a perfect rating."
4,Great product!,"This product is wonderful. I had bought another Bluetooth from a Verizon store and then went on Amazon to check out the reviews for it. While checking reviews, I came across this product and decided to purchase it because of reviews from people who had previously bought this product. I was more than pleased after eceiving it and using it. Only one person said they had difficulty hearing me when I was using it. However, I think it was more of a problem due to a low signal, not due to the product. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,Great Bluetooth Headset,Clear sound and easy to use. I can hear them and they can hear me. Great noise-cancelling. Very comfortable and light.
1,This headset is unreliable and hard to hear,"I have two of these headsets. I bought one and three months later the other person's ability to hear me was gone. I thought maybe I just bought a lemon. So I bought a second unit, same model number and 3 months later the exact same thing happened. The whole time it was difficult to hear while driving. My phone was all the way up and people were having trouble understanding me due to background noise. I would not recommend this headset to anyone. Cheap technology. I did call Motorola and their customer service was great. They agreed to take back both units and replace them with two more units. I have to receive the two new units, but honestly I won't even use them, I have no use for them."
1,Not Compatible,"Has good looks and size, special features not compatible with smartphones like treo palm, must have a motorola phone for it to work good, battery lifecycle not good, used it for about 3 months and battery never worked again :("
5,h700,"this is a very good device,,light weight, reliable with alot of function's.Once you've used it for awhile,, you will wonder why you would ever want to hold a cell phone again,,,,,, a must have product"
2,UNFORTUNATLY LOOKS ARE NOT EVERYTHING,"LOOKS GREAT, NICE FUNCTIONAL COLOUR LED'S, EASY OPERATION, USEFUL FEATURES, BUT POOR PERFORMANCE I FOUND EVERY THING VERY NICE WITH THIS HEAD SET EXCEPT: COMFORT, RANGE, AND RECEPTION/TRANSMISSION AUDIO QUALITY. USED WITH A MOTORAZR MAXX, ACCEPTABLE FUNCTIONAL RANGE IN AN OPEN AIR ENVIRONMENT OF LOW AMBIANT ELECTRONIC AND AUDIO NOISE, WAS ABOUT 2.5 METERS. AUDIO RECEPTION, BOTH ENDS HAD EXCESSIVE STATIC AND DROP OUTS, COMPARABLE TO THE HS820 AT 8 METERS. NOISE CANCELLATION IS POOR OR NONEXISTENT, WIND HOWL AND BACKGROUND NOISE OFTEN BEING DOMINANT OVER CONVERSATIONAL INFORMATION THE EAR HOOK OF THIS MODEL CAN PRODUCE MINOR FATIGUE. THIS CAN BE REMEDIED BY REMOVING THE HOOK FROM THE HEADSET THEN HEATING AND RESHAPING THE HOOK IN A HOT WATER BATH. (THIS PROCEDURE NOT OFFICIALY RECOMMENDED)"
2,experiment,"i thought since i saw all these controversial reviews, i would have my own experiment. both experiments were in same part of house at same time of day. --moto 700 vs. plantronics 510--I first bought the plantronics voyager 5101. it actually DOES go over 30 feet with avg signal2. controversing is very easy.3. little heavier than moto700 & is awkwardly shapedthen i bought moto7001. it barely went passed 5 feet from phone.2. it is more comfy and a lil lighter.3. setting up and controls are farely simple.over all** if u want the looks go with the moto, but dont expect to roam the room or anything. the plantronics is a little awkward at first, but its just as easy if not more and it goes 30-35 feet from phone, seriously!!all this was done on my samsung sync-cingular phone. at the same time and the same place in my house.."
2,Disappointment,This bluetooth wasn't compatible with my Sprint Katana II. I sent it to Motorola for a replacement and there was still a lot of static and echo on the other end so I didn't use it long. I gave it to my husband and it works better with his Verizon Palm Treo 700.
1,Arrived DOA,I can't honestly say how well this would have worked because it was DOA. We never had a chance to find out how good it was.
1,Arrived DOA,Maybe it is a great product but our arrived DOA.We consulted with Motorola Tech support and they ran us through some diagnostics and confirmed it had to go back to the Amazon seller.It is now on it return journey.Hopefully the replacement will function.The web blogs are indicating a 30% defect rate and the counterfeits are rampant.The Engineer
1,Muffled Transmissions,I like having the hands free but I have to put something between the boom and my face so my party can understand me. I keep hearing that my transmissions are muffled.
1,Terrible Mike; Terrible battery life,"Nobody could understand me on this device. They always thought I was someplace really windy even when i was in a quiet car. I expected the H700 to be an upgrade over my previous headset (HS850) but it sure was not one.The Battery life was terrible. I had to charge it multiple times a day to the point where it became unsuable. Going from an 8 hour talk time to basically 30 minutes was terrible.I think im going to to back to the HS850If you are stuck with this device and have a noise problem, one way to alleviate this is to hold the mike away from your face. The further away from your face the mike is, the better other people could understand me."
5,PRODUCT AND SERVICE ABOVE EXPECTATIONS,THE H 700 MOTOROLA BLUETOOTH WIRELESS HEAD SET IS WONDERFUL. IT PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED AND ACTUALLY DOES WORK. IT IS RELIABLE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN THIS TYPE OF DEVICE.THE SERVICE WAS ALSO ABOVE EXPECTED LEVELS. IT ARRIVED IN JUST THREE DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE ORDER WHICH WAS NICE. THANKS TO THE MERCHANT AND THE MANUFACTURER.
4,Sleek Bluetooth with great performance,"I bought this after using Plantronics and Jabra bluetooths. This has been the better of both. The best part is you dont have to play with the buttons to connect to the cellphone everytime, the mouthpiece when pulled out connects with the phone and when closed disconnects.Only drawback, sometimes when you are outdoors in the open you need to hold your hand over your mouthpiece for the other person to hear you clearly. Again, this is not often, happens only sometimes. Overall, a good buy !!"
1,"Same Printer, Same Problems.","I have had the same experience as everyone else. I replaced the cartridge and had no problems, but all of a sudden one day...it just started prining blank sheets. I am about 30 days out of my warranty period. Epson has offered to give me a discount on another product or fix this one for free, but I think the problem will continue to occur...I am just going to buy a new printer NOT and Epson"
1,A brand new CX4600,"Yes, it has great software that's easy to use. The scanner has decent quality. However, I NEVER managed to get this printer to print yellow and cyan and this was right out of the box. If you buy one on Amazon, I HIGHLY recommend that you buy the $9.99 insurance.But yet, before you buy, search google with the terms CX4600 and clogged print heads. You'll get the idea."
1,Is a -1 star possible?,"Save you money. I bought from Tiger Direct about 8 months ago. The first time we changed the cartridges, it starting running blank pages (with NEW cartridges). When we cleaned the nozzle heads, it depleted all the ink we just put in there. I wish I had read the reviews on this. I am going to by an HP PSC 1510, the nozzle head thingy's on that are replaced every time the ink cartridge is changed. Better reviews on that one at Amazon."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!,"This is classic Epson GARBAGE. The ink runs out after printing probaly only 10 pages and if you do not print every single day, the ink dries out and needs to be cleaned 3 or 4 times before it will print properly again. Spend the extra money and get an HP."
2,Do Not Buy This Printer - Known Design Flaw,"This printer has worked well for me for almost a year now. I'm a fan of Epson and do like this printer. BUT, there is a known design flaw that causes this printer to stop printing after nearly a year of use. The lines and/or heads get clogged with ink, even after multiple ""Print Head Cleaning"" processes are followed. Do a search on ""Epson CX4600 blank pages"" and you'll see. It's at the point where Epson corporate is replacing these free of charge with newer CX4800 models.Epson Customer Service handled my complaint well and is replacing my printer, but do yourself a favor...do not buy this model."
1,stopped printing altogether despite cartridges half full,"This printer worked fairly well for the first two or three months, though I didn't put it to much use. Soon, however, the inkjets began to fail - presumably clogging. Figuring I had simply run out of ink, I purchased a new set of cartridges at considerable expense relative to the initial purchase price. When this didn't solve the problem, I called Epson technical support. The individual with whom I spoke was rather rude and even adversarial. I wouldn't recommend purchasing one of these, though it did work admirably initially."
2,"Epson Stylus CX4600 Photo Printer, Copier, Scanner",I was very satisfied with this printer until recently. I had a very important project to print and all the pages came out blank. New cartridge doesn't help...cleaning heads was no good. Grrrr......
1,Another Dead Printer,"I've used both Epson, and HP AIO machimes, and they have the annoying habit of dying at about one year. When it does work, the CX4600 prints well. Unlike HP machines that announce an error code ("" buy a new one""), the Epson reports ""out of ink-black"". Once that is replaced, it then reports ""out of all color inks"". Another trip to the store. Once replaced, it's blank pages. After using about 20% of the new ink on headcleaning (where does it go? Not on my page!), the printer is broken.Couldn't Epson have a label on the box that says ""This printer will work until one day after the warranty is up."""
2,Doesn't Print Anymore,"Being unfamiliar with inkjet printers, my family left this printer unattended for 3 months. Now it doesn't print anymore. They bought all new ink cartridges and have used up over half of them on cleaning cycles. Still nothing except a few faded cyan dots. Avoid this if you want to use it as a printer."
1,The worst printer ever? Could be.,"Although my printer hasn't yet died completely, there is clearly a problem with the chip that reads ink levels. I use a printer very little, yet every time I turn on the computer, my ink level reads lower. When I remove the cartridges, there is clearly plenty of ink left, as evidenced by the ""sloshing"" sound. Believing it has no ink, however, the printer will not print.I also have a horrible time with the defaults. It constantly resets to 4x6 as the default paper size, and full color printing. Just try telling it otherwise! What a nightmare. This printer is not worth any price. I haven't decided yet whether to send it to Goodwill, or the dumpster."
1,Not worth money or time,"I do not recommend buying this printer at all. Sure, when I first got it everything worked fine and seemed great and all, but then later down the line things started messing up. I had to do multiple head cleanings and nozzle checks quite a few times and they suck up so much ink. And the ink is very expensive.Eventually, the printer started printing blank pages. I contacted Epson and they suggested head cleanings, which I did over and over again. I did them so much that eventually all 4 ink cartridges went empty. I thought maybe they were bad ink cartridges so I bought 4 new ones and tried it again. Same thing happened. I guess there's no way to solve the problem. I suppose my printer is dead. I hate this printer. And have gotten so frustrated with the cleaning process and wasting money on the ink trying to fix it. I just want to throw it in the trash. Hopefully my next printer, which will NOT be an Epson, will work out better."
1,WARNING: these printers don't last.,"You'll print great documents and photos, but don't count on Epson printers to last long. The Stylus CX4600 was my third Epson printer and it lasted only 6 months. The reoccurring problem with Epson printers are the heads clogging. If you do decide to purchase this printer buy the insurance, but better yet buy a different printer."
1,This is the worst printer ever!!!!,"I purchased my Epson CX4600 from Staples, and it has been a competent scanner for almost 2 years. Where it has failed miserably (and,in doing so,cost Epson my business) is as a printer. Like the vast majority of reviewers, I experienced the sudden death/blank page phenomenon, and this resolved almost magically after switching to another printer in the house for a month or so (and spending way too many $$$ on ink cartridges that did not actually need to be replaced---see practically any other review here). Not so quick...it began a series of feeder problems that made the blank pages preferable!These problems weren't only constant, but seemed to come up at the most inconvenient times. The scanner was good, but even when the printer worked it just wasn't consistent enough to be considered a reliable product.I would not suggest buying for a college student, a home office, or any purpose--it's competitors are reasonably priced and should last more than a few semesters."
1,Epson Stylus CX4600 bites,"I, too, has the problem with it printing blank pages, and I only ised Epson replacement inks. I've had the printer just over a year, so it's not under warranty. This is acting like an American-made car, so I'll never buy another one. I need a printer tomorr, so I'm going to buy another brand tomorrow. I got the printer for free when I bought my iMac. Even at that price, I paid too much for it.By the way, if there was an option, I'd give this printer a zero star rating."
2,Get what you pay for...,"I've had the Epson CX4600 for about 6 months now, and up until a month ago it worked fine. Little slow, uses ink almost faster than I can buy new cartridges, but overall a decent all-in-one. Then, I started getting the dreaded blank pages I've read about; cleaning the nozzles does nothing and uses a ridiculous amount of ink. When I contacted customer service, they told me to clean the nozzles (after I had informed them that I already DID and nothing happened) because sometimes it takes a few times... well, do that and your ink levels will be depleted by about a third and the printer still doesn't work. I wish I would have read reviews of this product before I bought it; I definitely would not have gotten it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is the cheap price and the fact that the scanner/copier works well (that is, when the printer is working)."
2,Prints well but don't recommend if you don't print much,"It's an overall decent printer as far as quality goes. I don't print much tho and every time I do (every few weeks) I have to ""charge"" the ink which in turn uses ink so it eats it up a lot faster and these cartridges aren't too cheap really. If you don't do much printing, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Bought 2 Epson Stylus CX4600 printers - BOTH JUNK,I have always bought Epson products. The first printer was dead after the ink ran out the first time. Since I bought Epson twin pack ink cartridge refills I bought another Epson Stylus CX4600 and before the second set of refills were used it too died. I will not buy another epson printer.
2,Disappointed by lack of OCR software,"The Epson CX4600 setup and software installation was relatively painless, and the unit appears to perform the basic functions adequately. However, I was disappointed to learn that OCR software is not included. When I called customer support, they informed me that the next model up, the CX6600, does come with ABBYY FineReader OCR software. It's also worth noting that the CX6600 is also a more recent model, and a bit my stylish than the boxy CX4600."
1,Please don't waste your money on this,"I have had this printer less that a year. The ink jets are always dirty and need to be cleaned, which uses too much ink. If I get 50 pages out of a cartridge, I'm lucky. Very surprising since my last Epson was fine."
1,"Horrible Printer, Terrible Support from Epson","We have 2 Epson CX4600 printers in our office. They recently both needed new ink cartridges. After installing the new cartridges, we only got blank pages printed. We followed the instructions given to us from Epson, to run the cleaning cycles, and still nothing would print but blank pages.When we called Epson for technical assistance they told us that our printers were not under a warranty anymore. One was bought 9 months ago, and the other was bought 10 months ago, and Epson said they aren't under warranty, and the only way we might be able to have them fixed would be for us to Mail them to Epson and they would charge us $65 each, to look at them and tell us if they could find any problem with the printer.Because of their lack of warranty support for printers that were bought less than 10 months ago, we refuse to purchase Epson products ever again."
1,I wish I had read the reviews,"This thing has turned into an unfunctioning piece of junk overnight. It was printing fine, slow as Christmas, but fine until a few days ago. It is less than ten months old, light use, & just a few days ago, it first quit printing black. I went through the whole routine of cleaning the print heads, nozzles, etc.Now nothing works but yellow. It is also the sorriest excuse for a scanner that I have ever seen.Consider this thing trash.... the first thing that I have purchased from Amazon that was junk.As for a rating, how about minus 5 ? Why do you insist that I rate it at least 1? This thing is not worthy of a 1."
1,do not waste your money!!!!,"the printer worked for less than a year, when calling tech support they wanted to charge me. search the internet, there are a lot of copmplaints against epson. it is an ink waster and the print heads clog easily, i just installed new cart and the printer started printing blank pages. this seems to be epson's biggest complaint, when i used up all the ink trying to clean heads, printer softwaresays out of ink buit there is still ink in the carts. get an hp, the print head is in the cart not the machine itself. i also had an epson c82, sae thing happened after less than a year from purchase. i will never use epson ever again!!!!"
2,Great printer--WHEN IT WORKS.,"I've had my Epson CX4600 for awhile now, and let me tell you: listen to all these people who have had their printer for any length of time instead of those who just bought it! Yes, it is a rather nice printer... when it works. I've printed many photos on it, and I'm mostly pleased with the quality. (I did have an issue where the ink did not stick on super-glossy photo paper.)Where this printer runs astray is the ink. This printer sucks ink like an SUV sucks gasoline. You have to use all cartridges pretty much EVERY DAY, otherwise they will dry out. When that starts to happen, you have to clean the print nozzles (all of them, not just the one you need), which wastes a LOT of ink. I've even had to clean the nozzles multiple times because it just wouldn't print.This printer is a joke. Serious manufacturing flaw, and I REGRET BUYING THIS. There's far better out there for your money."
2,ink vampire,I thought I was getting a good deal on this machine from Tigerdirect with a rebate and all. Turns out that this think sucks ink like there's now tomorrow. I don't print much but it still seems to cost a fortune to use this thing. I've had it for 6 months now and am on my 3rd set of ink cartridges. I just installed 4 new ones (at a cost of 35$) and now it only prints yellow...apparently it has a problem with clogging. I have used the utilities to try to clean the heads (which wastes a huge amount of ink) and it still doesn't work. I'm waiting for tech support. I would not recommend this printer at all. SAve yourself some money and buy something else!
1,frustrating machine,I finally gave up on this printer and purchased another one with a different ink delivery system. I don't print everyday and almost every time I tried to print something I'd have to clean the nozzles and that didn't usually work. I can't even comment on the print quality since there was always at least one color that wasn't printing and the colors that were printing weren't printing well. I was spending more on the ink than I did on the printer to begin with. If you don't print every single day don't buy this printer.
1,"Epson Stylus CX4600 Photo Printer, Copier, Scanner","This is very bad. The printer does not print, I changed the ink, installed it Ok. Scanned ok. Printing and copy do not work. This is used printer"
1,"Had a problem with ink, was replaced with 4800","CX4800 is excellent! The 4600 had an ink problem, so Epson sent me the 4800 instead for free."
1,Clogs all the time and uses up ink like crazy,"When new this product was nice. It was a good scanner and the print output looked good. However, if I don't print for a week the print heads need cleaning, and sometimes more than once. This cleaning in turn uses up the ink. For me I print about one thing a week, clean it once a week which causes my ink to run out in about 8 weeks. On top of this the cartridges are hugely expensive. I estimate I am paying somewhere around ten dollars a page! Obviously this printer is useless for my needs."
1,Another (unintentional?) throw away electric device,"Like many other reviewers, I was happy with the rep, price, features, and functioning of this printer - at first. I've had this printer for about a year and it has been used infrequently. I've replaced the (Epson) cartridges once or twice. It was easy enough for my kids to use, and has been great, until now. When it's down, though, it's apparently out. Within a couple of pages, it printed scattered infrequent black marks or a faint yellow (when any color but black chosen). Cleaning the heads did not help. I have an email into Epson but have lowered my expectations after reading other reviews -will update if any positive outcome emerges."
3,"Convenient, but costly","This printer is convenient to use because it has copying and scanning capabilities. It really saves space. However, the ink is used up quickly. This makes the cost of printing or copying very high. Another problem is that the printer head needs to be cleaned quick often. The software cleans the head, but has to repeat a few times before the head is clean."
2,Ink waster,"I agree with the reviews that recommend not purchasing this unit unless you print frequently, like everyday. If mine isn't used to print for a day or so, it requires a cleaning cycle to print properly. This uses large amounts of the very expensive ink. I intend to dispose of mine when the cartridges run out and try a different brand. I previously had an HP and never had this problem with it, even when it wasn't used to print for weeks at a time. All the manufacturers overcharge for ink, but you should at least be able to use all the ink for printing, not to constantly clean the printheads. If you use the 4600 everyday, it may not be a bad machine, but for the occasional user, I recommend not purchasing this machine or other Epson printers that use this type of cartridges. I gave it 2 stars only because it will make excellent photo prints and the scan/copy functions worked fine for me."
2,My friend was wrong,"I wanted a printer that was reliable. He wanted me to have one that made pretty pictures. My friend, the photographer, told me to buy this printer. I'm not sure we can be friends anymore. I've had it for 6 months and I want to throw it out the window at least once a week. If you can get it to work right, the print quality is fine. It just rarely works right. DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR FRIENDS - LISTEN TO ME. Don't buy this!"
1,Save your Money!! Less than 1 Star piece of junk,"Like a previous reviewer, we purchased this printer from Tiger Direct about 8 months ago and have now replaced the ink cartridges 3 times since the original ones that came with the printer. We print a few pages per month, and very rarely print pictures. It seemed like a good value at the time, but we've now spent $150 in ink and the printer doesn't print in color...online tech support recommends changing the ink cartridges (they're 3/4 full). Instead of spending the money on more ink, we'll be buying a non-Epson printer. After doing some research, it appears that Epson has changed the way their ink cartridges operate. There is a chip in them that makes the ink expire in 4 months to force you to change your cartridges whether you use it up or not and there is no way to save the ink!"
3,"decent printer, but one problem","From what I can tell, the printer itself is excellent. Other reviews have already been written about most of the things I could say, however.Except for one little thing that for me, and I'm sure for others, is a significant problem. It never allowed me to choose where to install the drivers and various programs. It automatically put them on my C drive under my windows folders which is the last place I wanted to have them. If that kind of thing is important to you, it might be good to look elsewhere. Otherwise, it's great."
1,Very Poor Quality--Do Not Buy,"This would be a great printer if it worked more than a week or two. Roughly two weeks after I bought this the paper feed broke and it wouldn't print (or scan for some reason). After talking with tech support and detailing the problems they agreed to replace the unit. The replacement I received was a refurbished unit, and it too died in short order. I took good care of both printers for the short time I had them, and neither one was used more than 5 times.Bottom line- don't buy this, it's a waste of money."
1,Avoid,"I would strongly advise against getting this printer. After several months, it spits out blank pages. This seems to be (a) extremely common and (b) a hardware problem. Epson is replacing people's printers with the 4800. They have offerred to ""fix"" mine (out of warranty). Before even considering this printer, google ""Epson cX4600 blank pages"" and beware. Also, I'm fed up with the cost and rapid consumption of Epson ink cartridges. Avoid!"
1,Do NOT buy this printer!!,"This is absolutely the WORST printer I have ever owned (about 7 in the last 18 years). While it OK as a scanner, it is HORRIBLE as a printer. It has an insatiable lust for ink. It is hell to print a simple letter. If one of the 4 ink cartridges is low printing is NOT possible, even if black is full and that is all you want. The qulaity is embarrassing if you are attempting to use it for simple home office professional things, such as client billing. Stay away from this one!!"
1,Stay away from this thing.,"I had this printer for a year and it worked fine. Prints were good, scanning was fine. I was very happy until just after the warranty expired. I could not get the paper to feed properly. The paper kept jamming in the printer. I tried everything to fix this including EPSON's support. No luck at all. So I boxed up this junk and put it down sellar. I bought a new Lexmark and I'm now happy again. I will NEVER buy another EPSON printer again."
2,Good for a year,"I agree with the recent reviews. Mysteriously, my printer stopped printing all of a sudden. It still scans and reads my media card. It will not print or run a self test. I contacted Epson and, after waiving the $9.95 fee to continue the phone call, they instructed me to clean the heads which did nothing but drain my cartiridges. I, too, went out and purchased all new cartridges. Still no improvement. I am in need of a new printer now and am tempted to buy another Epson only to get my money out of the new cartridges but I'm sure I'll buy a Lexmark instead. As a side note, before it quit, it did print beautifully..photos and text."
3,Brilliant score,"This is equally as compelling as the original score. How sad then to see that heaps of the films music was missing on the soundtrack and the version we have is all out of order. Why the music industry do this is bizzare enough but its long overdue a revamp AKA Jaws, close encounters, Superman etc."
4,Better than Jaws 1,"This is certainly better than the original Jaws score.It has more excitment. It is obvious than the film is much more inferior than jaws 1,but this another story..."
5,JUST ONE OF JOHN WILLIAMS'S BEST,"JAWS 2 SOUNDTRACK IS SUCH A REMAKABLE SCORE THE MUSIC ON THIS SOUNDTRACK IS FAR MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST. IVE ONLY JUST MANAGED TO PICK UP AN ORIGINAL COPY ON EBAY AND IT WAS IN MINT CONDITION. IVE BEEN SERCHING MONTHS AND MONTHS FOR THIS CD AND NOW I HAVE IT. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THIS CD YOU WILL KNOW HOW GOOD IT IS SUCH AS TRACKS LIKE FINDING THE ORCA,THE OPEN SEA AND NOT TO MENTION FIRE ABOARD AND EDDIES DEATH. LONG LONG OUT OF PRINT AND ONLY RELESAED FOR A LIMITED TIME THIS SOUNDTRACK IS A MUST FOR ANY JAWS FANS OUT THERE. SO IF UR LOOKIN KEEP TRYING ONE WILL POP UP SOONER OR LATER BUT PLEASE BE PREPAIRED TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOT IT A SITS VERY RARE AND COLLECTABLE."
2,Not the Best...,"It's not as good as the original Jaws (1975). The original Jaws was awsome! It Had a more freaky feeling. Jaws 2 has up tempo joyful music for like half the CD. The other half is abrupt, pathetic, altered version of the first Jaws' main theme. Not a suprise in it. Basically this CD is not John Williams at his best"
5,Great song from a great album!,"All I want is you features some awesome vocals and guitar playing...the B-sides on this CD are excellent too...check out this song live on liveconcerts.com - a part of the Paul Rodgers Live at the House of Blues concert archived there, that concert is fantastic!!!!!"
1,Will not rip,"This blade is so thin it will not rip, it just tracks off and follows the grain of the wood. It would not even cross cut 5 stacked sheets of 1/2"" plywood. It cross cuts a 4x6 ok, but wanders a bit on 3x6 ipe."
4,A name that'll stick in your mind for years,"I don't understand why people are looking at this book like it's some sort of historical text. I doubt many 5-year-olds are going to read this book and say, ""Well, it was OK, but it was full of historical inaccuracies and perpetuated stereotypes harmful to the Chinese community."" It's a story, nothing more. It's not meant to teach any life-changing moral. Stop searching for offensive material and enjoy the book the way a child would.A child will enjoy this, by the way. I know I did, when I first read it perhaps 25 years ago. It may not (as I said above) provide profound revelations, but it does encourage children to do the right thing whether people treat them with respect or not.Lighten up, enjoy the rhythm of the name, watch kids try to say it all in one breath, and years from now you'll still remember Tikki Tikki Tembo and his helpful brother."
4,Great Childhood Memories!,"I would like to express the impact that this book made on me as a child. I am 24 years old and this book has stuck in my mind throughout my life! I would always borrow it from our school library and bring it home to have my mother read it to me over and over and over again! Very enjoyable, read it to your kids!!"
1,written in ignorance and perpetuates stereotypes...just what i want for my kids - NOT!,"i vaguely recalled this book from my childhood, and was appalled at the storyline when i re-read this book to my children. being chinese, it was EXTREMELY offensive to see that this author attributes a nonsensical naming convention to my culture. not only are the illustrations way off (it's pseudo-oriental while being neither in the chinese nor japanese style of drawing), but how the younger brother is named chang because it means 'nothing' is ridiculous. this book is as offensive to me the 1930s movie of pearl s buck's ""the good earth"" was - played by caucasian actors with taped eyes and yellow makeup, it was (and still is) a blatantly ignorant attempt to make lot of money off of asian stereotypes. this book will never be seen in my house again."
1,Classic? perhaps. Stereotypes? Bad.,"While this apparently has a catchy rhyme, that's no reason to promote a book that perpetuates harmful stereotypes."
5,Treasure from the past!,"I remember this book when I was in my early years! This was many eons ago! Anyway, I saw it as a recommended book for me and I could not believe that I forgot this fantastic book from my past. I was at first hesistant to introduce it to my kids. My son who is 5 thinks everything is dumb or boring. It must be a phase. He told me it was ok. However, my 3 year old daughter was trying to memorize the name. It definitely has a ryhthm to it. The second time I read they were very enthusiastic about it. Now, they want me to read it to them to help them learn the long name. I am glad they think it is so much fun! I recommend this book highly for the ryhthm, repetitiveness that helps readers to progress."
5,I love this book,I used to sit and read this book over and over when I was little. I can recite his name by heart even though I haven't read it in 15 years. I look forward to sharing it with my kids!
4,From a mother to her son,"I remembered this being one of my favorite books to read as a child, and now my 21 month-old son always asks me to read it to him!! Reading it as adult, and as a parent, I was a little bothered by the second son, Chang's, name meaning ""little or nothing"" because I would never want ANY of my children to be referred to as ""little or nothing"". I don't know anything about Chinese culture or whether or not any of the traditions are even accurate, but when it comes down to it, it's just a book. Take it for what it is...a story, and try not to read too deeply into it, and this book is really enjoyable...especially when you get to say ""Tikki Tikki Tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo""."
5,Beautiful Illustrations and Fun to Read Aloud,The story is memorable. I bought this book because I remember how much I loved it when I was a child.It has beautiful illustrations.Tikki Tikki Tembo is also great fun to read out loud - although you may need to take a deep breath and practice a little first. Children will appreciate your efforts either way.
5,STILL LOVED: GENERATIONS LATER,"The other day, my two adult children and I were discussing their childhood memories of my reading aloud to them. They especially liked the voices I invented for each character in the stories. And when it came to naming their favorite book??? Was I surprised when they chanted in unison, ""Tikki tikki tembo, no sa rembo, chari bari ruchi, pip peri pembo has fallen into the well!"" They still remembered every word! So now, I'm ordering copies for my four grandchildren and I shall read it aloud to them."
1,"Propogates stereotypes, incorrect Chinese meanings","Yes, tikki tikki tembo, is a catchy phrase, but so are alot of things that are/were not really worthwhile teaching our children. Its 2010, let's teach our kids about other cultures and their stories in an illuminating (and moderately accurate) way. Even if the author had gotten all the Chinese meanings right (they are not even close), you can tell that she is not of Chinese background. Try authors like Karen Chinn, Ernie Chan and HongYing Yang, if you'd like to open your kids eyes to another culture."
2,"Rhythmic Story, but a little inaccurate","I think any child would love to hear the rhythm of saying Tikki Tikki Tembo's entire name. I would say that this aspect of the book makes it the most memorable. Aside from that, I would say, as a college student, I find many inaccuracies regarding the Chinese culture in this book. Firstly, the attire is more akin to the Japanese culture, and the name Tikki Tikki Tembo is rather misleading. I also feel that the indifference that the mother feels toward Chang may lead a child to believe that a second or third born is considered ""little or nothing"". I would recommend this book in terms of entertainment, but not for educational value."
1,Disturbing,"I just don't get how could a book that talks about a mom who names/consideres her second son ""nothing"" get so many good reviews???? This book isn't a classic, it's garbage!!!!"
2,Not Quite The Way I Remember It,"I vaguely remembered this book from childhood, and was delighted when I saw it at our children's library, but decided not to take it out after I reread it. Though the refrain of ""Rikki Tikki Tembo"" is very fun, the book really does have a pretty unpleasant premise. I really did not feel the unappreciated and unloved second brother theme was something I wanted my kids to read about, especially as there is no change or any sort of redemption for this son within the tale at all. I think that even my 4 year old would pick up on this. I'm generally not a protective or necessarily PC mom, but this book is going to stay on the shelf."
2,"Fun, but inaccurate","Tikki Tikki Tembo has a beautiful and fun name to say. However, that is where my praise of the book ends. The illustrations are lacking, not to mention inaccurate. A seemingly uncaring mother obviously favoring one son over the other is the main thing that stands out in my mind after having read this book. Perhaps my biggest problem with this text is the sweeping generalization it ends with, ""from that day to this, the Chinese have always thought it wise to give their children little, short names, instead of great long names."" I believe it is important to eduate and expose children to cultures outside of their own. However, we must do so in a way that promotes their curiousity and an accurate understanding. Multicultural literature can be a wonderful tool in the classroom as well as the home, when used properly; Tikki Tikki Tembo will be left out of my toolbox."
4,a classic,This is a wonderful tale and illustrated beautifully. I do remember reading this some time ago and it appears to be updated or rewritten and I think it was better in the original but it is one not to be missed.
5,Wonderful Book,I bought this book for my sister to bring back memories of our childhood. We both loved this book as children and always seemed to be the only people who knew who Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo was. The book is beautifully illustated also. Just as I remembered it.
2,Pros and Cons,"There are elements of the book that I both like and dislike. The book's best quality is that it is entertaining. It has a lyrical tone that is catchy to people of all ages, especially young children. If you are looking for a book that is going to excite your youngster and make him/her sing and dance, Tikki Tikki Tembo is a good pick. However, if you want your children to be able to learn something from what they read, this is not the book for you. Tikki Tikki Tembo is controversial from a scholarly standpoint because of its cultural inaccuracies and stereotypes. The illustrations in the book also leave something to be desired. Basically, whether you will like this book or not depends on what you are looking to accomplish by reading it. Personally, this book will not make it to my children's shelves."
4,Tiki Tikki,"I borrowed this book from the library several times to read it to my 3 year old and decided to purchase the book. It is a fun book to read, even for a 3 year old."
1,Awful message!,"This book sends an awful message about the value of children in the birth order -- the mother goes on and on about her most honored first born, and treats her second born horribly. I read this to my daughter once, and then threw it out. Don't buy it."
1,Terrible,"I cannot believe this book got such high ratings. If I could rate it a ""0"" I would.I checked this book out from the library and thankfully looked it over before reading it to my two boys. Why would a childrens story book be about the first born being honored and revered and the second one treated horribly? I just didn't find it appropriate for our family at all. My kids would definitely pick up on this.Sure the older boys name is cute and fun to say, and I can get over the Asian inaccuracies as others mentioned, but a Mothers favoritism in a child's story isn't appropriate at all."
1,terrible story,I took this book out of the library because I had read it is a children's classic. Thank goodness I read it first before I read it to my 3 year old son. The story is just awful focusing on the importance of the firstborn son and discrediting the younger boy. I was appalled that such a revered book included both children having near drowning episodes and CPR! I would not recommend this to anyone as I think the moral of the story is so negative and debilitating to children.
2,Incorrect title,"The original name of this book is not Tikki Tikki Tembo, it's Rikki Tikki Tembo. I dunno why I got so irked that the name was mispelled but this was one of my most beloved stories to read as a child."
5,Kids are smarter than you think,"This is a great book. The honored brother gets a grand name and ends up suffering for it. The ignored brother gets a meaningless name , but doesn't suffer and even is heroic. Plus you get to say a funny name over and over.That what kids will enjoy and that's what I remembered 35 years later. As far as historical accuracy or sibling rivalry or even racial stereotypes who cares. If this book causes your child to think in any of those ways you have a lot bigger problems than a politically incorrect book. You would have to throw out all classic childrens books, fairy tales, nursery rhymes, and also most disney movies to avoid any unpleasant reminders of the real world. Kids see through that stuff and get right to the guts of a story, only adults worry over or glorify the bad parts. Bottom line it's a fun book ."
2,NOT A TRADITIONAL FOLKTALE!,"This cute story is NOT a retelling of a Chinese folktale and should never be used as such. Mosel herself acknowledges that it is a story her father invented. There is no Chinese equivalent! In fact, Chinese names can be traced back for thousands of years in their current ""short"" form. My name, Chin, for instance is at least 2000 years old, dating from the Emperor Chin (or Qin), famed for, among other things, uniting the Chinese kingdoms and building the Great Wall. There are many authentic retellings of traditional Chinese folktales. This book, however, is not one of them. Please be aware that it is not an appropriate choice to use as Asian literature."
1,Disappointing as an adult,"I remembered liking this as a child, so out of a sense of nostalgia I hastily purchased it for my toddler. First of all, reading this book is tedious and exasperating, because as everyone knows, most children want you to read any book more than once (try 50 or a hundred times). But my biggest complaint is that the mother highly favors one child over the other, so much that his own name has a negative meaning, and it is pretty appalling to find out how differently she responds when each child falls into the well. Maybe some people think this is taking it too seriously but I do not want my children picking up on that. And as far as the stereotypes present...well, other reviewers have already pointed that out. I gave my copy away but maybe I should have thrown it in the trash."
2,kinda cheap...,"i guess i should have taken the hint from the phrase ""rouge scholars."" i thought this book was not the greatest. the first bit is pretty cool, but the rest of it sounds like something out of a video game or bad RPG (which some other reviewers have said it actually is). i wouldn't buy this if i were you. instead read grant morrison or pete carroll and experiment."
4,still a good album,"Most people will hate this album, after all it features yoko screetching and snorting and soaring over Lennon's hard line guitar and Ringo's solid drumming. mmmmThere are other explorations here with rhythm and voice. Most of the time Ono manages to sound like a synthesiser, and to stretch what people could do with their voices on rock records. Sure not all the album is great - the 16 minute bonus track south wind could have easily been left in her apartment where it was made, and AOS sounds like almost everyother peice of sixties avante guarde. But that still leaves you a lot of passionate noise and rythm.Anyone who likes experimental rock should have this in their collection."
5,Don't go shopping for kiwis in a shoe store!,"Here's some great universal advice: if you don't like country music, don't buy a country music cd and review it as terrible.. of course you'll think it's terrible... if you don't like Britney Spears, don't buy a Britney Spears cd and review it as terrible. Same goes for Yoko... if your simplistic mind can't handle an avant-garde cd, don't buy an avant-garde cd and review it as terrible. And yes.. Yoko does scream over and over again in ""Why?"".. and has a very humorous laughing trip in ""Why not?""... but uhmm.. has anyone ever tried to laugh high pitched for 9 minutes?? Has anyone ever tried such a high pitched scream? It's harder than you;d think... so don't say Yoko Has no talent."
1,Excruciatingly Frightening,"Plastic Ono Band by Yoko Ono (to be confused with Plastic Ono Band by John Lennon) answers several questions: What would a goat sound like if it could plead for its life before being slaughtered? What sounds does a cat make when caught in machinery? What does a baby crying incessantly sound like when played backwards? What does a coven of witches sound like when being burned at the stake? If you need answers to these questions look no further.John Lennon, Klaus Voorman, Ringo Starr, Ornette Colman and Charlie Haden cannot overcome the vocal noises made by Yoko (there are no lyrics). This will frighten little children and deafen anyone who has the courage to sit through the entire CD plus bonus tracks.All that can be said is that John Lennon REALLY loved Yoko Ono.[DW]"
1,this blows,cant beleive a genius like john would even associate his music with this asian goofballthis is not even close to art or music its just plain garbage and yoko is an idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Come on Yoko???,"This album would be great, if it was just Ringo, John and Klaus Voormann jammin' out and going crazy. It would be the best, if only Yoko would just be quiet for 10 minutes. Well I guess John was diggin' Yokos ""thing"" so Ill have to deal with it. But the band on this album is just great, and the music is so crazy and good. But Yoko screams dont turn my ears on so this is a pass unless you love John and Yokos first three albums."
1,Avant Garde...,"...is just another way of saying that something is not commercially accepted and is horrible. Let's all put on brown bags and dig this rotten album! Yipee! It's ""AVANT GARDE!"""
1,is everybody mad? this is awful.,"John Lennon's companion release is one of the greatest albums ever recorded. This album is just painful. I had to review when i saw someone compare this favorably to Sgt. Peppers and another reviewer say Why not was better than helter skelter. For the record: though this has some great backing tracks, yoko's voice is barely listenable. She ruined John's appearance on the Rolling Stones R&R Circus and ruins Double Fantasy and Milk and Honey. Thank god that these songs were not interspersed between John's POB songs."
2,A low point for Yoko.,"I'm a fan of Yoko Ono. I think she's a genius and when it comes to a ""who broke up the Beatles"" argument I am the first to defend her.Still, when this came out Ono was in a pecarious position. She had no experience writing songs, and yet she had just been forced into the music industry. This and it's followup ""Fly"" are more of the avant-garde Ono ""Pieces"" than music. Yes, the backing instrumentals are catchy and Ono's improvisation is ingenious (let's see YOU try singing ""Why Not""), but she has done far, far better; lyrically and musically."
1,You don't have to be a hippie to know it's not music,"Attention No Wavers and Avant Guard fans: Make all the noise you want, just don't call it music. I am ok with Yoko recording some caterwauling and have nothing against anyone who buys it and listens to it. I do not blame Yoko for ""breaking up the Beatles"" and I don't believe she did. I am glad the Beatles broke up because they went out on top and never released dreck like Bridges to Babylon or Steel Wheels. I am happy that John met and fell in love with Yoko. But come on, without her famous husband no one would have paid attention to her noisy, annoying albums. If you want music, this isn't for you. Period."
1,PLEASE STOP TORTURING ME,"As noted by another reviewer, it is very rare for an Amazon editorial review to say anything negative about a product Amazon is selling. So when the Amazon editorial review above states that this album was originally released to broad disdain, BEWARE.The Amazon editorial then claims that this album laid the groundwork for future musicians. Don't believe it. That is just bull that Yoko's publicity machine has put out to make her seem to be a misunderstood artist who allegedly was way ahead of her time.Let's face it, if she werent' married to John Lennon, no one would have ever permitted her to record this trash, much less try to sell it to an innocent, unsuspecting public.The world lost a great entertainer the night John Lennon was murdered, but John's unfortunate passing does not suddenly make Yoko a talent. This album was garbage when first released, and it is still garbage today.I would give it 0 stars if I could. AVOID."
3,"Keeps the tool handy, HOWEVER.......","Yes, it keeps the drill quite handy, but one word of caution.... you have several pounds of cordless drill swingin' around below your waist with a sharp object sticking out of it. There are just some places a #12 c'sink drill bit aren't meant to be. It's a good idea, but be careful."
1,"Good Concept, but Poor Durability and 0 Company Support","As a tool holder, it worked great. But in casual homeowner use over a less than 2 month period holding only my 12V drill, the aluminum rivet holding the 'Lugg' to the spring steel belt clip broke. As an engineer, it became obvious that a joint between aluminum and spring steel requires special consideration that was not given in this design. To make matters worse, I contacted via e-mail the company that produced this, from whom I bought the device originally, and have yet to hear from them. If your's breaks, don't try to fix it yourself. I did, and the 'Lugg', which also appears to be made of aluminum, failed at the thread as I was removing the nut. There was probably some loc-tite in the top nut. Yes, the device is very useful, and relatively inexpensive, but if you buy one, be prepared to replace it often."
4,Bigg Lugg needs longer belt clip,"I use this every day as part of my tool belt for my cordless drill. Only one problem. Through movement, the belt clip slips up off of my tool belt - clip needs to be about 3/4"" taller and more rigid. Otherwise, it's pretty handy."
1,Nice Idea - Bad Application,"The Bigg Lugg's idea is a good idea, but does not allow the person to get to the gun and get it out of the cradle. Most of the time, the clip comes off with the gun. Not a good product."
1,Bigg Lugg doesn't work for some drills,"I can see how it's a really great holster -- for many drills. But I have one of the older Makita drills that has a long straight handle, not one with a big lump at the end. I'm sure it's great with the lumpy drills, but for my straight drill, I had to abaondon this and get a Search 940528 holster, which works OK (though probably not as good as a Bigg Lugg with a lumpy drill)."
1,Fell apart already,"These seem like a good idea, and they work pretty well, but I have only had mine for 7 days and it already fell apart. I fixed it easily since the nut just fell off, but it really isn't that great a design. I think I would try a regular holster holder for a drill next time. These are handy for their versatility, but the lack of trust in it actually holding a tool makes it worth less."
5,The best of the ones I've tried.,I have used several different versions of these over the years and this one has lasted longer and worked better than the rest.
2,Not worth the money,This thing pops of the belt too often. Risk the well-being of your tools everytime you use it.
2,Weak-Lugg,"This is an example of a good idea badly implemented. The clip slides up and down the tool belt and the hook bends easily. I stopped using it after having my Panasonic drill fall to the ground twice. Should have used steel, not Aluminum for the hook and come up with away to keep the clip from sliding. Unfortunately, this is useless."
2,"Overpriced, poor quality","Simply put, this belt hook isn't worth the retail price. It does hold virtually any tool, as advertised, BUT:1. When not in use, the belt hook continually snags on objects. Even if you fold it in, it works its way out and becomes an annoyance.2. The wire hook that holds your $200+ cordless tool bends rather easily when snagged, and can result in a dropped tool.3. The cheap plastic swivel and rivet arrangement that transfers all of the weight of the tool from the wire hook to the spring steel belt clip BREAKS easily.All in all, this clip is NOT recommended. The versatility is nice, but the quality of construction/materials and overall performance just don't make it."
2,Not too crazy about this item,The first problem I had with this item was that it kept sliding down my tool belt and finally the clip bent so that it didn't grip any longer. So I cut the part that hooks over your belt and fastened it with a small screw and that part is great now. But now my drill sometimes falls out and the hook bends open even though I have a fairly light drill (4.4 lbs). My friend has a cheap looking hook and his gun never falls out. I would not buy this kind again until they improved it.
2,Good Idea....But,"I'm an interior trim carpenter and I bought one of these to hold my cordless drill while installing bipass doors. It seemed like every time I tried to take the drill off the hook, it would hang up. I tried to tighten the nut so the hook wouldn't swivel as much, but still had hang-up problems. Also, when I wasn't carrying my drill in the hook, it kept falling off my belt. Mine now lives in the bottom of my misc. junk bucket. Hope this helps."
1,Watch those toes,"I bought the Big Lugg because I am a carpenter who is constantly looking for ways to make my job more fun and to justify trying new gagets. I thought this gaget would be great for my 18v Makita drill. Unfortunately, the first time I moved, the drill fell out and landed on my foot. Needless to say, after a couple of choice words, I packed the Bigg Lugg up and sent it back."
5,"""The essence of genius is simplicity."" - Emerson","Duh! This is such a simple product, designed for clever reliable use. I have two of them and tossed all the other gizmos for belting my cordless drills. Folds out of your way on your belt when not holding a drill. Clips on and off with ease, but stays put otherwise. My only problem is that it is so easy to misplace in my tool box or on a job site. Or perhaps someone else likes it too and helped themselves to it! If so, least they know a good thing.It just makes me ill to think that I could have designed and patented this simple to-the-need too and be retired by now. I could have been a millionaire!!"
5,thin lizzy sounding,"I got the secound album first so this cd was better than the first ,both both album rock .This cd is a little thin lizzy ,and some cheap trick in there and other classic rock .Pluss glder writes good songs and is having a good time . If you enyoy classic rock you like this iam sure ,i hope this review was helpful to you"
4,O'Mally Chronicles Volume 2,This is the last 3 books about the O'Malley's. This book follows the younget of the adults but they all seem to go in and out of each others lives just like a reqular family. They are easy to read and to follow but their lives. They are all looking for something and at the end they find it.
2,"Great Book, no so good condition.",We were a little dissappointed in the condition of this book. It obviously has had water damage because the book is warped and does not close or stand in a book shelf correct. This was a Christmas gift and I was a little hesitant to give it by the way it looked.
5,Dee Henderson is super!,"If it says Dee Henderson I want to read it. I have the O'Malley Series and it is on my keeper shelf. My daughter, grand daughter and hair dresser have all borrowed the books to read. I love her books! I like the way she allows her faith to shine through even in the difficult situations she writes about. She shows how you can stay strong in your faith.God bless her!"
3,Morrissey throws his hat in the ring...,"You are the Quarry is not a bad disc but it screams of calculated, money making in the simplest form. Morrissey follows the trend of Depeche Mode's ""Exciter"", and moreso the success of David Bowie's ""Heathen"" and ""Reality"" CD's. It is simple, now that the teen fans that made Morrissey, moreover, the Smiths a hit are now 30-40 years of age and are buying and spending all over the place. The sad part of You are the Quarry is that there are some good 80's retro songs on here but the listener is left with the impression that once Morrissey knew that he had a few good songs in the can, he filled the rest up with filler and bolted the studio. ""Irish Blood, English Heart"" is a good and catchy single... but the album ( god I must be old ) falls fast from there."
4,......Typical.,"It's not exactly the type of music you're going to listen to on a Friday night at a party, is it? But this is not the platform for this. I say.... welcome back, Morrissey. This for me is another fantastic, thought provoking, intense album from Morrissey.Does it stray from his previous albums? Nah.... He's not trying to re-invent himself is he? Why play around, or alter what's been proven to be a winning ""recipe""?You either enjoy the sound of Morrissey, or you don't. It's that simple, there is no in between, but please listen to the lyrics as much as the music.I gave it four stars, because that's what it deserves, there is no five star album, in my opinion, ever, from any artist.In a nutshell - if you enjoyed the sound of Morrissey and Marr, if you enjoyed ""Viva Hate"", ""Bona Drag"", then you will enjoy this."
5,Brilliant,"Thanks Moz, for returning with impeccable style. ""You Are the Quarry"" is a brilliant album from start to finish. There are no dull moments. Simply one of the best Moz albums to date."
1,Horrifyingly dull,"I thought it was impossible for Morrissey to make an album worse than Maladjusted. I was incorrect.While Maladjusted had its moments, You Are The Quarry is the most shockingly banal album I've ever heard. ""Irish Blood, English Heart"" is the only song that I can bear all the way through without snapping off the stereo and staring balefully at the Morrissey on the cover. What made him think this was releasable?""The only one around here who is me is me."" Oh? The profundity astonishes. God awful lyrics through and through. This man used to be clever. Cheesy electronics, recycled instrumentation, slick production of a voice that's best left alone. I can't believe other fans accept this.I'd give it zero stars if I could."
1,This album is terrible.,"""You Are the Quarry is so effective because it's less an overt rallying cry than a heartfelt plea for the world to make sense to him again."" (from the Amazon.com review above)Sure. As soon as young people start to respect this aging has-been the world will start to make more sense to him. Any day now...This album is terrible. Morrissey is terrible, too. I loved everything between Bona Drag and Southpaw Grammar, and I've seen the guy many times, but this album sucks. Maladjusted sucked. Morrissey has lost his touch. ONLY high-schoolers trying to fake some kind of cachet and PAID REVEIWER STOOGES will find anything of merit on this album. ""English Heart..."" sounds like some old, drunk Irishman wandered into the world's most expensive studio while a bunch of fifteen-year-olds from Orange County, CA were trying to start a mall-emo band. Thumbs down!"
2,"Time To Retire, Moz.","This is either a ridiculous collection of bilious pop songs, or a bilious collection of ridiculous pop songs. Either way, it's bad.Am I mistaken, or is there actually a song here called ""I Like You""? What a jerk."
1,Bloody wanker... Sorry I ever owned a Smiths cd now...,"Give me a break. Morrissey is a bigger fraud than Enron. does the guy really think he is something unusal. Typical Christophobia, America bashing, and everything else people are trying to do to be hip and mainstream. Still the old stick in the mud he always was in more ways than one, just playing depressed to rip off mopey teens for their mall money. The old Smiths sound was interesting, this is just silly attempt to put another album out, maybe it will be a hit in Commie Old England. Wanker..."
1,Morrissey as Center of the Universe,"With the exception of one track I did not like this CD at all. I found it to be too over-the-top-self-indulgent, for my taste, and lyrically rambling. The big controversial ""America Is Not the World"" starts off strong, but ends up in an immature kind of rant, which is unfortunate, because I think the idea behind the song is important. I think Morrissey is a phenomenal talent, but many songs on this CD made me cringe. ""I'm Not Sorry"" , however, is the sole exception. Go to I-Tunes and buy that song & maybe track 1 if you're curious, but I'd pass on the rest."
2,He really needs Johnny Marr to prick his balloon,"Those of us who like Morrissey (and particularly the Smiths) look forward to his solo releases in the same way you look forward to a new John Grisham novel: rarely great, often good but predominately derivative. Morrissey is ultimately a good Bowie/Bolan/Ferry immitator. (Of course, he denies this, but after all, he even brought in Ronson to Bowieize his one truly classic album, ""Your Arsenal"".) . The problem with this album isn't the usual sophomoric lyrics, it's that it sounds like outtakes from the last three albums. It's not terrible, not quite good, just forgetable and irrelevant."
5,STILL DEPRESSED AND STILL THE BEST,"This has got to be the best Morrissey album yet. I am always tickled to read people's reviews when they dislike Morrissey for his complaining and whining. That is what makes him so wonderful! He is the master lyricist of our time.The best way to enjoy this album is to listen to tracks 7, 8, and 9 first. They are so awesome. I have been a Morrissey fan since the early 1980's, and this album has got to be his best work. ""You have never been in love until you've seen sunlight thrown over smashed human bone...."" Need I say more?"
4,Thank G-D he's back!,"It's been far too long since his last album and that is my only complaint with You are the Quarry. Morrissey sounds perfectly grumpy, angry, sad and hopeful and his voice has never sounded better. If his last two albums were too spacy or unfocused for you, than You Are the Quarry will be a perfect listen for you...with tight well thought out themes and Morrissey's beautiful pen and heart prose...I highly recommend this album to the die hard Moz fan, the casual Morrissey listener or the long lost Smiths fan..."
1,Pathetic and sad attempt by Morrissey,"I had high hopes for this CD only to see them dashed to the ground by what seems to be more of a message in song form. The music is not quirky Morrissey, and it starts early with the first track which is a clear attack on America's influence. It doesn't matter whether you agree with his message, it is not Morrissey's style and it clearly shows.The CD was not quirky, but serious. Sadly, without Morrissey's off-the-wall lyrics, his music is dull, even painful."
5,morrissey does it again but better,"Morrissey is one of the few artists today whose music doesn't sound like a disney movie plays; manufactured in a machine shop. Morrissey and a select few have the ability to manipulate music, to understand musical composition and put that understanding in to practice, to use the voice as an instrument that symbiotically accompanies the other instruments instead of being the focal point with the music as mere filler. This is by far one of his best albums with melodies both hard and soft, terse and supple, he delivers quality with every single track. Not a moment is wasted with this gem. If you can appreciate music then this is for you. If you're looking for the latest fad in recreated beats then look elsewhere, there's a pile of trash on the left I believe."
4,"Solid story, but thin on romance","I really want to love Kenna White's work. I *like* her plots, her characters and the pacing. I've read her early work and I've seen her grow as an author. She just needs a little nudge from a good editor in the right direction and I'd absolutely love her stuff. What I think she lacks is a little more romance, a little more tension and flirtations between the love interests. Oh, and more sex. Then her work would be perfect."
3,Nope,"So I did it, I read another Kenna White. As with the other book, it was a good story, solid writing, likeable characters.Unfortunately, as with the other book, the ending here was rushed as well, added to the fact that a rather ludicrous storyline was added towards the end that really didn't accomplish anything toward the major plot.I'm not sure what makes writers to choose that their books are better if they go out with a bang. That works for some story lines but here it didn't, IMO.But I guess now I know that abrupt endings are White's style I'll stay away from her. Too bad, because I really enjoyed the stories otherwise and the writing is good."
2,Really bad filler character,"I must admit that I was enjoying this book, regardless of the wrong adjectives used. In actual fact, there was a lot of wrong words chosen but I got over that.I have noticed a lot of authors are using the wrong words and after checking my Microsoft Office thesaurus, I know why. I would like to suggest to authors to get a decent dictionary or thesaurus OR to use an online dictionary/thesaurus and not rely so heavily on Microsoft. So very many of their words are either wrong or inappropriate.Anyway, to continue with this review.What I didn't get over was the added fruitloop character that I felt was included to bulk out the book. In all honesty, I ripped out those pages. I thought it was a much better read but a friend borrowed my copy and was pissed off that she couldn't read those parts."
2,Truly disappointing...,"Quite frankly, this record disappoints. Although I am a longtime JM fan (saw him live the first time in the mid-60s and never looked back... ) unfortunately I have to say that this record leaves a lot to be desired -- poor sound, weak material, and the delivery (especially on some of the tracks from the 70's) is simply embarrassing. Thank goodness it lasts only 36 minutes. For ""completists"" only..."
4,"Not his best, but still pretty good.","Mayall is Mayall. This record is no exception. While I personally prefer his studio work, this isn't bad for a live performance. Some of the live BBC peformances I have heard over the years have seemed over produced. Not so this one. Again, if you are already a John Mayall fan, you won't be disappointed. If not, let me suggest Spinning Wheel."
4,Teach yourself Visually Word 2002 - Reviewed.,This is a well written book I used it to teach Word 2002 to a friend. I think it might have been better if it had more exercises.It is good for a beginner/novice who hasn't doesn't have a good knowledge of word processing; someone who needs key stroke by key stroke explanations.
2,Homeowner's Delight,"This table is a delight. The cutting accuracy is incredible. Having recently retired, I'm catching up on 30 plus years of ""honey-do's"", including house remodeling. The large table space and the ease of operation are features not found on other saws I've owned. The portability is a major plus. Highly recommended."
2,Item was great but in no hurry to ship,"Item was great but in no hurry to ship. I was told that I would get the item within 6-10 day. Well lets try 15 days latter. I even called them a few times and they always told me ""Oh it will go out the next day."" Wrong, I am not sure what the next day is to them."
3,5 VOL.,"Food, Farming, and Hunting-Buildings, Clothing, and Art-Trade, Transportation, and Warfare-Medicine and Health-Science and Technology-"
5,"big, beautiful glasses","I really wish I could find these available again! They are large and elegant, the perfect wineglasses! My set has suffered a couple losses (they are fragile) but they're so pretty I'd keep buying more. They are large and tall- 10-12"" or so."
2,Some good tracks is all.,"While I have enjoyed several of the other works by the Residents. This collection has a few tracks on disk one and a couple on disk two that stand out for me. The rest of the work reminded me of a free form jam session at a Dead concert. For me the money spent was not a good value. Most of the tracks that stand out are on disks that you would find on recommendation lists. So I paid about $4 per track of music, that I would listen to on an MP3 player. If you have very little of the bands music you should find about 6 or 7 tracks that you will want to repeatedly listen to. If you find less then that, this music just isn't your cup of tea."
3,"I didn't hate it, but ...","The heroine was frustrating -- she loves the hero, he loves her, he wants to marry her, and she looks for reasons to turn him down. Then, she does some really moronic things to try to convince the hero that she's not worthy of him. She really is an immature brat a lot of the time.This book is 460 pages long -- there are a lot of unnecessary scenes and details throughout the book, but amazingly enough, there are a lot of loose ends, too. And then there are ""jumps"" in logic that are unexplained and make no sense.One thing I will say is that this book was originally published in 1986, and it was one of the author's earlier books.I also think that the title could have been better.It was entertaining for a weekend read, but definitely not one that I feel comfortable recommending."
3,Not one of her best,"I agree with the other reviews, it's too long and takes too much to get out what she wants to say. I don't know why Meredith doesn't accept Lord Rutherfords offers either - sounds like a good deal. I love Jane Feather's books, but this one wasn't one of my favorites."
2,Not One of Feather's Best,"I normally like Jane Feather's books. The ""V"" books were great. This book, however, seemed to go on and on and on. It seemed to me that Lady Meredith had very little reason to say no to Lord Rutherford's proposal. The reasons given were a little forced, if you ask me.I agree with previous posts that the book could have been shorter."
2,Too long...,"OK, i am a fan of Jane Feather books, read alot of them and i also read other romance books. The Smugglers Lady had a good concept, but it was to long. I really liked the beginning, but after about the 300th page, i wish it had ended then. Not gone on for another 100+ pages. If you want to try it, borrow it from the libary, DO NOT buy it, it is not worth it at all..."
2,Nice idea but could have been minus 200 pages,This is my first Jane Feather book and I was very excited to read it based on the reviews and the back of the book. I am only at the 300 page mark and finding it hard to believe that I still have 150 pages left to read. I am forcing myself to finish it but I feel almost no desire to find out what happens. I was dissapointed when Lord Rutherford discovered who the smuggler was in the first quarter of the book. The book holds very little suspense and I might just skim to the end.
1,Give up the verboseness,"It was an interesting story - way too long, but my problem with the book is that Mrs. Feather used too many words that are not used in today's language. I don't mean in the dialogue, I mean in descriptions."
3,okay shed,i don't think this shed is exactly worth the price they get for it. It does not go together easy. Once it was together it leaked. It does say to silicone the roof which has been done and it was better. The doors are not even and one came dented.
2,For those Hardcore Seether fans only!!!,"Being a big fan of seether and owning Karma and Effect already, I picked up this CD for one reason and one reason only. The Remedy (Acoustic Version) track (from Rockline) since none of the music download places such as iTunes or Kazaa seem to have it. It makes you wonder if paying for shareware is even worth it if ALL the music you want is not available. OK, the video was cool too.I am however kicking myself in the head for paying such an outragious price for such a small amount of music here (much of which I already own) but it is a single so what do you expect? Thank Amazon for third party sellers though. Keeping this short, just buy the full length album instead (for almost the same price) and wait for the accoustic version to come out on some download site and get it there, unless you have no patience for shareware like me."
3,Born to be Healthy and Thin,As a chemist I found a few errors in his book such as the one on page 141 where he is discussing trans-fatty acids. I have heard Dr. Komadina speak and he is a compeling and charismatic speaker. He really looks healthy and trim.
2,"Fox Home Video needs to Re ""Visit"" this film on DVD","Why go to the trouble of releasing these films in these horrible pan and scan versions? This isn't VHS here. Films starts in a beautiful widescreen then converts to the old 1.33 ratio. Might as well not even release it as you don't see the whole film in pan and scan. Shame on your Fox Home Video. Take a cue from Warner, they don't do this!"
5,The visit. A classic,"Excellent plot, cinematography in the grand style .Top notch acting. Should be a required must watch. Watching it, is akin to having a seven course meal, not a hot dog n chips."
4,"Mosaic, a new, peaceful hobby",This book is a small vacation in itself-peaceful and highly varied beauty in design and color. I did miss a Spanish artist's work I was hoping to see. Susan Beck
1,Designers very repeditive. Only a few stand out as unique.,"My complaint is the lack of different design approaches, most seem pretty casual, hit or miss, and many are miniature pieces, or partial views of larger work, without an over-all view, or total environmental view, except for the Boston ones. A few are very exciting."
3,OK mice for everything except gaming,"This mouse is great for multitasking, and the tilt wheel certainly is no gimmick, but there is a slight lag, which is noticable only in games. There is a cool feature that allows you to only have one battery in, and the mouse still works. The single battery has to be placed nearthe middle or there is a strange feel to it without a proper center of balance. Wireless is a lot more comfortable than a mouse anchored by a wire, but if you want a gaming mouse, go logitec. They make the best mices for gaming."
1,poor ergonomics,"I acquired one of these mice in a Microsoft Optical Desktop 2.0 bundle.The scroll wheel also scrolls sideways, but this is of little practical use; it also requires far much more force to use it as a middle mouse button that it's useless for gaming.This model is much higher than most normal mice I'm used to, and I found myself getting a sore hand after using it for more than half an hour.If you're after an ergonomic mouse by Microsoft, consider one of the newest series three Microsoft IntelliMouse models. If you're after a decent symmetric pointing device, consider something simpler such as the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse."
1,Warning! Worked for a while then sucks!,"I bought this wireless mouse a few months ago and have had numerous problems. This mouse just plain hasn't worked for me. I've tried every type of surface known to man and the mouse still has problems working properly. Buttons don't work, my left-right scroll doesn't work, pointer doesn't move correctly. My old Microsoft wired optical mouse was fine on the same surface. I seem to have good connection and battery, but can't continue to fight with this thing. I'm plugging in my wired mouse. I do have a Logitech wireless at home and it works great. Make sure you really shop around before you buy."
1,Inadequate driver software,"The driver software does NOT work with any version of Windows except Windows 2000 and XP. The mouse itself appears to be mechanically excellent, but the lack of driver support is unacceptable. Buy Logitech instead."
3,Nice but software bug,"I bought two of these. They're good to handle, nice to use and look at, and a real step up from the wheel mice that we had before. They really do increase my productivity (i.e. my willingness to click), and it was good to throw out the mousepads. The BAD PART is a warning comes on the computers evey couple of days. It says something like ""Warning -- Low SIgnal.: It happens on both the PCs, so it is obviously a glitch in the mouse software. I think it might have to do with dust or something in the mice.....no idea. It is disconceting."
5,Very Very Very comfortable!!!!,"Did I say it was very comfortable?? :)I bought this mouse about 6months ago and I didn't have to replace the battery yet!!! Amazing! and i use it 5 to 6 hours a day! I suffered from carpal tunnel syndrom and my doctor recommended I buy this Microsoft mouse. Since i started using this mouse, i don't feel any discomfort from using my computer. And because it was designed by Microsoft, i had no compatability issues with my computer."
3,not perfect,"Yes indeed, it is an ergonomic mouse and easy to carry with your notebook. Why am I rating with 3 stars? My first intention on purchasing this mouse was to use it during oral presentations, this device is supposed to work with a distance up to 6 feet from its receiver, but in the real life, it only works within a distance of 3-4 feet... The problems increase when there are other electronic devices close to the receiver, fact that diminishes the quality of signal transmision. If you are a teacher or one of your tasks on your work is to give oral presentations, I only recommend this wireless mouse IF you also buy an USB extension cable that can help you get the receiver closer to the mouse... In this way you won't have to worry about distances."
2,Bad Item,"I have had 3 of these microsoft wireless mice, and none of them had lasted me more than 6 months. i was stupid enough to keep giving it another try.The mouse worked great for the first few weeks, even months. It was really good while it lasted, i have to admit that, but afterward, it was a complete disaster. Double-clicking doesnt work anymore, and even worse, the pointer does not response to the mouse correctly, range from not moving at all, or going to a completely random direction. I tried changing the batteries, nothing happened.The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because of its comfortable design. the mouse feels great in the hand. The scrolling wheel is nice, love the way it feels, but to be honest, the sideway scrolling is completely worthless, doesnt even work 75% of the time."
3,Smooth but erratic,"I like this mouse quite a bit, but at least every couple of days it pops up saying it can't quite read the base, and do I want to run the troubleshooter. Otherwise, it's a great mouse. The optical feature is fantastic. It's a good size, and feels nice in my hand. I like that the roller on top is smooth. I ended up buying one for a new member of our staff, since mine worked out."
3,"Sluggish scroll wheel and no 'click' feedback, but overall good","A decent mouse. I have used it at work for the past 2 years. I've had to change the batteries about once every 3-4 months which isn't too bad.My only problem with this mouse is the scroll wheel. Its a very quiet scroll wheel, which is nice, but the wheel gives no feedback. No feeling of ""clicking"", not even slightly. Also, over time it has gotten progressively harder to spin it. I mean, it was always alittle sluggish but it gets worse and requires more effort, which causes fatigue much quicker than you'd think."
4,Great Job Microsoft (I doubt I'll say this again in my life),"This is a (sigh) great mouse from microsoft. I love the way it fits my hand. The scroll wheel is incredibly smooth and allows for more sensitive scrolling. Also, like the box says, this mouse is very economical (when it comes to batteries). I have found it to have great battery life. I was able to use it without having to replace the batteries for 4 months. (I use my computer a little more than most people.) My one complaint happens to be wiith the selling point of this product. The tilt wheel. I barely use it because it cannot be programmmed to do anything except move from side to side in large documents. (I have a large flat panel display and I keep my resolution at 1024x768, so I never really have documents that need to be scrolled side to side). I was hoping it could at least be progammed to move back and forward in my web browser or highlight text. Still this is a good mouse that is reasonably priced."
2,This is a Kids Opinion,"yea, im a kid, and my dad wouldnt buy me a new mouse since he said the one we had (wired, not opitcial) was still working, and he was right, so i bought this mouse because bluetooth was MAD expensive, and i installed itand it worked. however, the next day, i tried it and it just all of a sudden screwed up. the pointer started getting laggy, and the mouse still was MAD ssensitive, making me lose in cs ...like 0:5 ratio!!!!!and this is what i say, DONT BUY ITthat cheep tilt wheel thing was so stupid, you barely need it, and the mouse design isnt good for the ""right"" part of your hand-bad mouse-bad design-overly sensitive-sux for laptops-tilt wheel is just another one of those gimmicks (it works, but you rarely need it)-SUX"
3,Beware the tilting wheel,"In other respects this mouse is pretty good. However people who use the wheel as a button (for example, opening new tabs in Mozilla), should know that while that capability is still there, it is tricky to use. The tilt functionality is triggered instead, more often than not. It is very hard to press the wheel down perfectly vertically, so as not to tilt the wheel.The tilt functionality itself is not that useful anyway, so on the whole this is something of a backward step.Apart from that, the mouse has good ergonomics, and tracks the movement quickly. I wish they did a left handed version of their top of the line mouse (the Explorer), or failing that added more buttons to the symmetrical models such as this one."
2,Stopped working after 1 year,"I bought this mouse about one year ago, and I used to love it, even if it needs new batteries every 2-3 months, but now it's starting to die, the left click button and the signal are failing, sometimes I can't click anything at all, I've replaced the batteries 3 times and it's still malfunctioning, I had high hopes for this mouse :(, so buy it if you don't expect to keep it for longer than 1 yearPS: do not buy it if you're planning to use it for a laptop, this thing is huge (it fits my average size male hands perfectly), not portable at all, and the signal receiver is also huge, it looks like another mouse, I didn't know where to put it since its so huge and ugly looking. Not for laptops since it has a cord going from it to the back of the PC"
4,VERY PLEASED,"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT I BOUGHT AND THE QUICKNESS THAT AMAZON GOT IT SHIPPED OUT. WOULD I USE AMAZON AGAIN? YES, THEY PROVIDE A GOOD SERVICE. BREEZY"
1,Perhaps the worst mouse i ever had!!!,"I bought this mouse as part of the wireless desktop 2.I'm extremely happy with my new keyboard but i really hate this mouse. it's bulky, it's slow and the middle mouse button requires actuall pressure until you here a click for it to work properly.I will finish saying that the tilt feature is probably the most useless gimmick ever.I love microsoft mice i always had a microsoft mouse and my favorite one is still the blue optical USB one. I prefer a mouse that fits comfortably in my hand and feels like a natural extension. no matter how much time i gave this WOM2 it still feels like an uncomfortable piece of junk."
3,"Scarfs up the batteries, but a good mouse otherwise","This is one hungry mouse and requires feeding every couple of months! The six month figure quoted above is highly optimistic--I have yet to have a pair of batteries last three, let alone six months. I have gone through a dozen AA's and have come to regret not purchasing rechargables. Other than this, the mouse is wonderful, fits my hand like a glove and, to me, represents mouse perfection.But it got a bit expensive on the ol' batteries. I do suggest getting rechargables. And why didn't Microsoft include them in this $30 - $40 package? It would have cost them a couple bucks at most. Thanks Microsoft for filling our nation with millions of discarded batteries, so that additional mercury can sink into the national water supply."
1,Disappointing,"Mouse is clunky, feels too big for my hand - frequently 'lost' connection and then finally just stopped working all together.I expected better from a Microsoft mouse."
5,Great multitool,"I just received mine after ordering from Amazon (after waiting almost a month!). It's a very solid tool, and it's lighter than the comparable Leatherman, which I was also considering. My only two complaints are that the scissors are very small - moreso than my previous Swiss Army Knife that was significantly smaller - and the knife is the combo-blade without a sharp point. Rating this tool down one star for this might be too much, though.Locking tools are very nice, the case looks nice, and the bonus mini-knife is a good addition too."
3,This is a good book summarizing Wrights Usonian work,"Good background material on the development of the Usonian concept. Lacks what many of FLLW books lack, color photography. Seeing these homes, especially the interiors in color, makes your perception totally different. Good work here, belongs in all Wright collectors libraries."
3,The Less Well Known FLLW,"The author spent six years researching the book, which is ostensibly about the houses but quickly turns into a book about the man. And how could it not? How many famous architects built mostly houses? Or started a commune during the Depression? Or had elaborate, futuristic, monorail-equipped cities all planned out in complete detail?Profiles the iconoclastic artist a bit too sympathetically at times, though. For instance crediting him with setting the example for the Postwar ranch house, which would have undoubtedly emerged on its own. He also defends FLLW's writings as well as anyone could, but they're really too old fashioned to mean much today.The drawings--just small floor plans--are nice but no details are included. Otherwise, plenty of substance."
3,Pain,"Received on time, the box was destroyed and the hitch scratched up. The 20 minute install was a joke. I had to pry, pound, and bang this hitch to get it in. The problem seemed to be that bolt holes between mounting tabs were about 3/16 of an inch to close to each other. Once in [2 hours later] the hitch looks like it belongs right where it is. Now to purchase some black paint to repaint it and I'm finally finished, maybe.I would have given it 5 stars except for the condition it was in when I received it in and because of the diffuclty of the install, the paint also chips VERY easily."
5,One of a kind,"Last night I was looking for an album to test out some new earbuds. This was the first one that came to mind, because it covers such a huge range and variety.Bothy Culture is an amazing mix of club beats and highland sounds. I don't care whether you think you hate bagpipes or not, you should check this out. What Martyn Bennett did with these highland sounds was amazing.And the beats make this a perfect album for workouts. It starts out strong and fast, and then shifts into a higher gear that makes you go even harder.Listen to the samples and see what you think. And then give it a try. It's almost guaranteed to be different than anything you've ever heard."
5,Really GREAT!!!!!!!,Martyn Bennett est un musicien hors paire il fait preuve d'une qualité exceptionelle dans sa musique : DE LA MUSIQUE!!!!!! sans faire de commerce de la musique celtique qui porte actuellement.
3,Bennett's Story is Better than the Album,"With its driving electro rhythms and wailing traditional Irish folk instruments (played by Martyn Bennett), track 5, ""Ud the Doudek,"" is a pretty fun listen. ""Hallaig"" is also worth hearing, for Irish poet Sorley MacLean's recitation of his own marvelous poem set to Bennett's effective backing music. All in all, however, with due respect to Martyn Bennett, his diverse musical background and tragic demise are more compelling than the music on this album."
4,Not a bad CD,"This is a pretty good CD. Flowing with sounds and rhythms, it takes you flying throughout a lush world. Very clever creation, but not the best of its sort that I've heard."
1,Concerned Consumer,"This memory card is great if you want to save a slice of a game. Its way too small, wish I would'nt have bought it."
2,Scary book,"As I read Kimberly's book, I kept waiting to be enlightened. Instead, I read a horror story about malicious spirits and haunted houses. This book was scary and not enlightening at all."
1,Shocked me back to reality;probably a good thing,"I was but a wee lad of 8 when the Beatles hit our shores, and I was entirely smitten. Their music, their dress, their actions, words and manner all captivated me. I thought they could do no wrong. Imagine just four years later at the tender age of 12 I was accosted with this nonsense. It was dreck then at age 12, it is dreck now at age 53. Though I continued to like much of the Beatles music, both group and solo, this album proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only were the Beatles not Superman, they (or at least John) was capable of putting out embarassingly bad product. George followed suit with Electronic Sound, but at least his embarassing moment was covered with his own bad drawings rather than his and his wife's genitals.Shockingly bad taste then, shockingly bad taste now. That it is in print 40 years later is only due to the rather pathetic need for the Beatle fan to ""have it all."""
1,WTF Is This CRAP?,"Shockingly bad, unlistenable. This is the end result when narcotics totally screw up your judgement and sense of reality. This should have never been released. I don't understand why this is still in print, just because its Lennon? If anybody else would have made this the master tapes would have been thrown in a dumpster. At least they could have put some sounds of them screwing at the end of Side B."
1,Wrongheaded Garbage,"Unlistenable and without substance, it's clear that Yoko is responsible for the majority of what appears on this disc. When it was first released, it was simply grating and annoying noise. With the passage of time, it now seems silly as well."
4,history,"Not exactly music, this was recorded the same night that John and Yoko first made love; hence, the title _Two Virgins_. While it is possible to decipher an occasional melody, usually on piano, the real interest on this recording is not its melodic qualities, but rather its purely sonic moments. Listen with your eyes closed and imagine the two of them in love, engaged in the art of creation. Bizarre, beautiful stuff."
1,The emperor has no clothes...literally...,"Sorry for the extraordinarily cheesy pun, but in the case of this THING (not an album), it fits nicely. Anyway, this unconsciable crap would never have been released if John wasn't on top of the world in 1968. 1 star because there is no option for -5. Sorry John."
1,ahoy,"Hey John here again. You might remember me from such ventures as the plastic bags in bed incident, or the naked on the front cover incident, or the breaking up my band because of my incessant girlfriend incicent.I'm here again to flush toilets and put reverb on them, make squealing sounds late at night, blow tubas in a random way, sing a ca pela to nothing in particular, record the lot, shove it in some stupid sleeve with my naked self on the cover again, and sell it to anyone who cares. Oh, and because you NEED to know, I made love to my woman the next morning.\Nothing has worked thus far..Not my protests, not my great songs, not my controversial actions. So stuff you all. I'm not even going to try anymore. From now on, I record anything in any order and use my wang to sell it.Good day to you. I am the high art creator."
5,Make Them A Double,"Well, you can certainly hum to it should you like. If you do, however, you might miss the humor. On the other hand, how actively you listen to TWO VIRGINS depends most likely on how seriously you take it. Me, I listen to it in the spirit in which it was recorded and released: sometimes from another room.'Remember Love' (it was the B-side of 'Give Peace A Chance' - - these two loved imperative titles) has her Husband inverting the guitar part for 'Sun King' as His wife sings a lullabye; that the two lose their place midway through and then find it again is . . . suitably 'charming'."
2,well.....,"well i guess its ok... i mean i understand that fact that they wanted to show their love through music but.. this is so damn ridiculous! sure its a classic but ahhhh! listening to tubas, creepy piano keys, yoko screaming, and of course john being john for a half and hour has got to drive someone other than me crazy!I mean sure it was the late 60s but thats no reason to take your clothes off and scream for a 1/2 an hour! Thanks but no thanks!Frosty"
3,Not impressed but SATISFIED,"You will enjoy owning this album IF: 1) You are an absolute Lennon fan (of his music and ideas) 2) and you enjoy (or can at least tolerate) experimental music. Why? This disk has no songs, just random sounds (like ""Revolution 9""). The sounds aren't amazing, nor disturbing, but it is an interesting collage of sound. It's notable that this is one of the first ambient recordings ever recorded and an extremely bold move by Lennon. At the time, he was at the pinnacle of his fame and had recently divorced his wife for Ono. For him to put out an album of noise with a stark naked cover was outrageous. Basically, this was Lennon giving ""the finger"" to the artistic trappings of his fame. And it's a great COLLECTORS ITEM now, nothing more. I'm glad I bought it."
1,Shi** of the highest order,This is SHI**This is SHI**This is SHI**This is SHI**This is SHI** you surely get the message by now!
2,A First For John & Yoko,"Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-). Search Judemac Forever"" on msn."
4,John And Yoko Unfinished Music #1: Two Virgins,"You know it took me many years to even try to understand why this even made any sense at all. Well it still don't. If you are a collector of John Lennon's past this is the one to get. Although being a collector as myself, go for the numbered edition. It seems to be a collector's item just to have. You can chance listening in headphones but I would not advise it."
3,Good Avant Garde Stuff...,"As a fan of avant garde music, and of John and Yoko as a musical pair, I enjoyed this album. However, I can fully understand why many people don't like it, and some people just plain hate it. I still think it was very courageous of John to release an album like this when he was a member of the biggest rock group in the world.It consists mainly of chatter, strange noises, the occasional piano, and the occasional snippet of Yoko screaming. I prefer the work they did on Life With The Lions and The Wedding Album, as this album feels very rough, mainly because it was recorded spontaneously in one night and probably wasn't even intended for a release. If you're a fan of John and Yoko, like me, then it's definitely worth getting just so you that you can say to people ""I've got the naked album with John and Yoko"" but, if not, then just leave it and go on to something else that is more mainstream."
1,Listened partially once,"I bought this 8-track in 1971. I tried to listen to it in my car while driving, but just couldn't. It was completely unbearable for any sane person. I was a hippie and huge Beatles fan during that period, and I couldn't comprehend this. I traded it to a friend for an 8-track of Iron Butterfly ""Live"". I can't imagine what my friend thought of me after that."
1,Two Virgins-Unlistenable Music #1,"Basically John and Yoko playing around like two kids with a new toy, in this case a tape machine. In fact, you could have probably sat two nine year olds down with the same equipment and acheived comparable (if not superior) results. I like John's music, but this is a complete waste of money and is the most inessential CD in his catalog. For hard-core fans of ""Revolution #9"" only."
1,Garbage,"Basically a recording of sounds from John and Yoko's first night together, there is no real music here. Perhaps some avant garde types can convince themselves that this is some brilliant achievement, but for someone looking for music this is trash. The test as to whether you may like this is Revolution #9 from the White Album. If that is one of your favorite Beatle tunes, this album might be for you. Everyone else should stay away."
1,"Music, this is not","Yoko mindlessly howling and screeching while John messes with his guitar and piano, then distorts to make it sound strange, for a half hour...and I thought Revolution 9 was bad."
1,What?,"This was the biggest waste of money that I have ever spent in my whole life. The title of the disc is unfinished music, yet, I cannot figure how it can be labeled as ""unfinished"" when there was no music to begin with. It's just a bad mixture of low fidelity sound and a lot of noise. About 30 minutes worth. One track. If this was recorded by anyone other than John Lennon, it would never had been published let alone received the praise that it has from the ""critics"" that label it as pure genius. If I were to record a half hour's worth of noise and try to sell it, labeling it as unrefined genius, I would be the laughing stock of the whole midwest. When Lennon and Ono recorded it though, they were hailed as visionaries. Whatever. Listen, it's a waste of money, don't buy it."
2,Unfinished Music No.1,"The first in a series of anti-popstar releases designed to, and largely successful in, knocking John Lennon off the pedestal his fans had erected for him. With his new avant-garde wife at his side -- and enough money in the bank to last a lifetime -- Lennon set about ruining his bank value so he could return to being a 'private citizen.' All three albums -- Two Virgins, Life With The Lions & Wedding Album -- are potent reminders of a simpler time when artists could experiment wildly (or just be very silly) and still get released and distributed (erm, somewhat). Rykodisc nicely duplicates the original packaging (except for an odd anachronistic sense of prudishness) and the remastered sound quality is, for 1967, pretty darn good.Of course you can't actually LISTEN to this stuff...."
1,"Lennon's nadir--""Two Virgins""","""Two Virgins"" lives up to its title--it sounds like it was created by someone with absolutely no musical experience at all. While I'm a big fan of Lennon's Beatles and post-Beatles solo albums (even the weakest Lennon album ""Sometime in New York City"" has its minor moments), I found this completely unlistenable and a waste of 30 minutes of my time.Is ""Two Virgins"" misunderstood? If it is it's because it's in an incomphrensible musical langauge. The cover was the only thing this album was notable for--a nude portrait of a couple who had found love. It created controversy (EMI didn't want to distribute it). As avant-garde its too simplistic as music it's a disaster. Avoid unless you must have everything (including every fart, belch and toe nail trimming) from Lennon."
1,"Two Damfools (three, counting moi)","I remember the afternoon in 1968 when I walked into downtown New Haven's Merle's Record Rack and was shown with great furtiveness a NEW John Lennon LP that was being kept UNDER the counter. It was literally encased in a brown paper slipcover that revealed only John's and Yoko's b&w; faces.As if being let in on a big conspiracy, I was told that the Beatle and his wife were totally naked on the cover: frontal nudity and rear nakedness on the LP sleeve's flip. So, like a dummy I laid out good money for what is TOTAL GARBAGE.Noise. Junk. Offal. Piffle. You pick the negatory noun.The photos are ugly. The recordings are uglier. This is the barrel bottom of Sixties crapola, and that's coming from a devoted John Lennon fan.Please don't make the same mistake I did way back when."
3,Cool looking - but Timex Internet Messenger watch better,"These watches are cool looking - but having to recharge your watch every 3 to 7 days seems like a pain. Timex has has the Internet Messenger Watch for a couple of years. Does all the same things - stock quotes, weather, your horoscope, sports, very customizable. Also - can send reminders. Does basically all the same things - the battery lasts a lot longer. Unfortunately they have been discontinued. When you bought the watch for $100 you also got a free year of nationwide service that worked pretty much everywhere with Skytel. You got an 800 with your own voicemail, and unlimited text messages. While these watches might look cool - they're more expensive and aren't really doing much new - plus coverage is a lot less limited. The Timex was was also an Ironman - waterproof - not sure if these are... It's funny how they play the technology as something new - but it's been around for several years now."
2,Big but underpowered,It was mismanufactured and sat out of square on the sled. Then the degree angle levers were misaligned;you could not tighten them as they struck the sled. I found that the big hole in the sled makes it hard to use when starting cutting a beam. The power is not alot different than my 7 1/4 Bosch circulat saw. You have to be really careful to pry away the cut off as the saw binds and stops.The guard lever needs to be longer as NORMAL fingers cant hold it up when starting the cut.I did not find it all that heavy.
5,Great Shoe,"This is my second pair of Mezlan branded shoe, and still NO regrets. The Quinn looks great when woren with a suit and it really compliments a professional look. Highly recommended."
1,Ted,"I don't know if Yoko really broke up the Beatles, & I don't really care. One thing I do know, is this album sucks! I can't believe people gave this CD 3 stars & up. Some of you wrote this was ""advant-garde"", ""cutting edge"". Are you all hearing impaired?? After all that wailing & screaming, this CD makes me want to throw my Stereo off the edge of a cliff. This CD should come with a Warning Label: ""Listening to this CD could cause permanent brain damage!"""
1,There's Something About Yoko,"OK, not to be perverted, but WHAT is going on with this album cover? Looks like she has a streamer of...Goo Goo Ga Choob...on her face. Hmmm....perhaps her and Ben Stiller compared notes. Incidentally, looking at what's on the cover is infinitely more entertaining than what's on this album."
1,Crap,"It kills me to see the Yoko apoligists here. If you were to put a turd in front of a great front band and have it scream, it still brings out the elitists who will say ""By jove, I don't believe I have ever heard a turd scream--why, this must be some high new art form! I will prove my acceptance of art and distinguish myself amongst my other posers, and proclaim this enjoyable!"" You are the same group that applauds the crufix in a bottle of urine as art. Yoko is the same art form. Enjoy."
1,Great Gag Gift,"Lately I've been listening to the music of John, Paul, George and Ringo after the break up. Some of it wasn't too bad. I decided to listen to some Yoko as well, which prompted a co-worker to give me this CD. What surprised me the most about Yoko was not that she was bad-- we all knew that-- but that she was THIS bad. Her ""music"" is truly awful. She wails and screams and makes weird noises and tries too hard to be 'avante garde.'It's great if you want to really annoy your co-workers and friends, but it's not something you would probably want to listen to with any regularity."
1,This recording is a borderline criminal offense,"The making of this recording should have been a criminal offense.Amazon should consider allowing for zero stars on their ratings and this album, in my opinion, would be right at the top of the CD releases."
1,A Hard Jo(o)b's delight (?!),"Ah, don't mind that crazy title of my review. Perhaps not really obvious for everyone...For god's sake people! The fact is that if Yoko and John had been never married, Yoko would have drown in the sinking barrel of the long time forgotten avant-garde zanys. Avoid this like the plague."
4,"The ""Standard"" Stand Mixer","My wife and I chose this mixer because it was the ""standard"" mixer to get. It is the first one you think about when you think ""stand mixer."" I was inclined to go with other brands as I liked some of the European brands features, but the price was good and after my wife used it for the first time, she loved it. That is all that mattered.One thing that we don't like is that the supplied splash shield doesn't prevent all the mess and there is a gap at the back of it that provides an easy escape point for ingredients. You can tell that the shield was an afterthought and eventually it will be relegated to the back of the cupboard to be forgotten about."
4,Essential,"I wouldn't think of getting one of these portable saws without the Rousseau table and this extension. I've thrown 100# sheets of MDF on this table (using some additional saw horses for side support through the cut) and ripped them down to usable size by myself using the rousseau table, this extension, and outfeed table. Accuracy is as good as I can measure for large sheet goods. Just like the Makita saw, set it and it stays set."
3,Less than expected,"The whole Rousseau set up is a little wonky. There are set screws to adjust the angle but you have to reef on it to get it in and out of the base table to adjust. After all the wrestling it's not in line with the main table. This product gives me the extra rip capacity I want, but it's far from perfect. I have it because I need it."
2,Warmans Antique Jewelry,"This is a good book FOR someone who knows what the heck they are talking about! The drawn pictures are way too simple to understand on the mechanisms and the rest of the photos are nearly all in black and white which don't help one bit. Waste of my money, wish I had purchased a book with all color photos and actual pictures of the mechanisms. The dating section is once again.....too simplified to really ""Date"" a piece."
4,Picks up a lot of dust,"I bought this unit about 2 months ago. It is used in the master bedroom, which has a 16-foot high cathedral ceiling and forced air heating. That means a lot of dusty air to clean. I have found it to be quiet and very effective. It can collect quite a bit of dirt, so I can go 2-3 weeks between cleaning. The cleaning light has not gone on, so it can evidently hold even more.It is very easy to clean. I put it under the shower and wipe it with a cloth. It is impressive to see how much dirt has been collected (and a relief to know I am not breathing it in.)My one complaint is one that others have mentioned. The power light is overly bright for a bedroom. I took another reviewer's advice and covered it with black electrical tape.That solved the problem.Finally, it is much less expensive than the ones advertised on TV and I am glad I bought it."
3,IONIC PRO ION AIR CLEANER,The IONIC PRO air cleaner is quiet & runs well & seems to be easy to clean. I wipe the blades & occasionally rinse off the dirt using my shower. The fact that it needs cleaning shows that the ION blades are absorbing the fine floating dust from the air.This is important to me.I know the cleaner is doing a job but it hasn't seemed to improve my particular nasal & congestion problems. (but neither have any of my DRs)
4,Good,"Since I've bought it, I've had no problems with it. Had some buzzing after 3 weeks, but cleaned it, and the buzzing went away. Cleans the air well."
1,worthless,i dont know if it was because it was an ionic thing BUT it had a smell i didnt like.the light never came on to clean it and the plates were really bad looking.
2,Warranty is awful,"The unit I purchased worked great while it worked but it stopped working after 4 months. I simply would not turn on (search the internet and you'll find others who had similar problem. I called the company and they were willing to replace the unit but for a $29.95 shipping and processing fee! I did order a replacement unit but when it arrived, there were not instructions on how to return the defective unit. I called customer service and they wanted ME TO PAY to have the defective unit returned. I refused to pay and after much arguing, they agreed that I could discard the unit without returning.If this replacement unit breaks, I you can bet that I'll never by anything from Ionic Pro again!!"
3,Pretty good but not as good as I expected,"Cleans the air ok but the LED indicator that tells me which level of purification I'm using does not work right - sometimes it lights up, sometimes it does not. We do notice cleaner air and the dirt on the electrode blades are evidence that this product is doing it's job. Overall, I'd say it's a good deal compared to the name brand version of this unit."
1,Do not waste your money...horrible customer service.,"I have never written a review before, but feel compelled to do so after my bad experience with this company. I bought three units from Amazon about 2 years ago. Honestly, I am not sure if the units really work but the reason I am giving it a 1 star review is because of the conversation I just had with their customer service department. The woman didn't try to make suggestions as to why the red clean light came on; instead she told me I needed to purchase a $29.95 extended warranty for each of the two units AND pay $29.95 for each to be returned. No apologies; no standing behind the product. Just more money. I was furious and told her I would be writing a negative review on Amazon. Her response, was thank you very much. Ridiculous. Do not buy these machines. I wish I never did."
2,Ionic Pro Review,"I purchased my Ionic Pro Turbo from Wal Mart in February 2009. It was easy to use, totally silent and very efficient for approximately five months. Then I started having problems. It kept shutting-off, I found myself cleaning it every weekend. While this took little effort, the Ionic Pro failed to operate properly. I returned it to Wal Mart customer service. They indicated the item was outside their 90 day return policy. So, I contacted Ionic Pro directly. When I spoke to their customer service representative, she gave me a confirmation number and had me fax my purchase receipt. She stated that I must wait 48 hours before contacting Ionic Pro again. Additionally, she indicated that I would be charged $29.95 plus shipping for a replacement product. My wife and I have decided to purchase another air purifier, one with better customer service and a better warranty.Ionic Pro 90IP01RF01 Turbo Ionic Room Air Purifier"
2,Review of IonicPro Turbo Air Purifier,"The ionicpro seemed to clean the air pretty well. The problems with the unit are that mine only lasted 17 months and then died, and the limited warranty is only for 1 year. Also, it was noisey while running at time, so you cannot sleep with it in the same room. For the $179 I paid, I would have thought it would last longer than 17 months. That's my biggest complaint."
3,A few problems...,"I bought this product for a christmas present and it worked great for a little over a week. Then, we noticed that two of the three little light bulbs that display whether the setting is high, medium or low had burned out. We called amazon and they said to send the machine back and they will send us another one.(free of cost) When we plugged our second one in, we noticed a very loud noise. We checked the blades and they did not need cleaned. So, once again we called amazon and they sent another one. (Free of cost also) We've had the third machine for a little over a month and have had no problems other than a little crackling noise every 5-7 days (meaning the blades need cleaned). Even though we had a few problems and it took about 2 months to actually receive a good working machine, I am satisfied with the purchase."
1,"POOR C,S.","I have had 2 machines, nierther one has lasted very long, when I called thier custormer service it was a joke,Once they found out that I needed to return the item (full size) they hung up and woul dn't answer the phone when I called back."
1,dont waste your money,"Bought two of these, and they worked for less than a year. Both of them broke. Immidiately the clean light turns on and the product will not work. No amount of cleaning will fix this."
1,It's all true! This is nothing but a death trap.,"What you've read and heard is all true. This product does nothing for you except offer discomfot, light-headedness, nauseousness, and utter disappointment. I bought mine a year ago in Lubbock, Texas; and all I can tell you is that I have not experienced any beneficial side effects from using this particular unit.Ever since I bought that thing and used it in my dorm and apartment each day, I've had nothing but problems with my heart (which I think is due primarily to use of the Ionic Pro). My doctor advised me to stop using it immediately, and guess what, after a few months the pain in my heart stopped. This thing worries me so much that I will never buy anything ""ionized"" or releases ""ozone"" particles into the air ever again - period. Please, everyone, don't even consider purchasing this.You will only be asking for severe health problems. An absolute waste of money!"
4,Ionic Pro Review,"It works really well at reducing allergens (my husband has been inhaler-free for three weeks now!). However, when the Ionic Pro needs to be cleaned (after 3-5 days), it starts to buzz. Quiet at first, then louder and louder. A little annoying, but not enough for me to return it. All in all...I'm glad a bought it!"
2,Dust in the wind,"This Ionic Pro air purifier was purchased along with two other large Kenmore units as a battery to mainly help reduce the dust in my home. With only about a month's duty, I can see a reduction of dust, but absolutely not near the 99.3% or so that this unit and the others advertised. Two nice features of this Ionic Pro are that it operates in total silence. The other feature is that there are no filters that need to be replaced, which should make this unit more cost efficient. Although I haven't had to do so yet, there is an inherent danger of residual electricity in the collection rods that must be discharged before touching them to clean them! I am not too keen on that idea!One other small drawback is the ozone oder that this unit produces. For me it is negligible but some may object. Simply, it has not seen enough service for me to rate this unit any higher than 2 stars."
3,Can't tell if it's work,"I have been using this for half year...can't really tell the different after using it. I have a cat at home, but the filter only trap a very thin layer of dust, not even one hair of my cat. ( My cat loose a LOT of hair)."
2,ozone alert,"I bought this for my home due to difficulties with allergies. After I had ordered it, but before it had been delivered, I read the Consumer Reports article reporting that these Ionic purifiers (this brand and other brands) put out ozone, and are NOT recommened. The reason the air smells so ""clean"" and fresh when in use is the ozone it is putting out. Not what you want when you already have respritory difficulties.WARNING: Before ordering this please read the review in Consumer Reports!"
1,Don't waste your money,This Ionic Pro Air Purifier does not do as it says.Theres no difference in the air. It is a total wasteof money and Amazon says free shipping when it costalmost $13.00 to ship it.
1,DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH,"Air Purifiers were recently reveiwed by Consumer Reports Magazine. They are quite ineffective and can be dangerous to your health. For further info, read article in Consumer Reports."
1,Not mature product,"It looks like good when you buy this product new. However, it works only for a couple of weeks, then noise comes; the longer the more, and finally, you cannot tolerate and have to give it up. I have bought this product for six months and threw it away. My conclusion is that this is a not mature product on the market. Don't buy it. The manufacturer should make more lab research before put it into market."
2,Don't buy! Here's why!,"I bought this and then did my research. I know; that was dumb. Let me share what I found out and what led me to return the product. 1) This does not do much to clean the air. Consumer Reports did a study and found out that there is not enough air circulation produced by this gadget to clean the air. Sure, it will grab some of the dust floating around but so will fly paper. 2) This emits ozone and ozone can be dangerous to anyone with lung problems. This unit is made in China. Do you really want to trust that a foreign made product is going to be made so well that ozone levels will not exceed what is healthy? I don't. Sharper Image sells a gazillion of these - but you should check out what consumer reports says before you go for one of these."
4,"It does what it says it does, just not as well as it says it should","I bought it because I saw someone else cleaning theirs.After having it for a couple months, I've some to the conclusion that it does what its supposed to, but not as well as the advertisements say.Plus: It does remove the odors, allergenes, and dust out of the air and it does work almost silently.Easy to clean. Room smells better than it did. Cheaper than competition's similar products.Minus: You almost have to have a fan blowing air into it to keep the air circulating, otherwise it'll barely move the air around.Designed for smaller rooms. So I wouldn't plan on your entire house smelling better. Smaller HEPA air purifiers designed for 1 room are much cheaper and don't cost near as much as the advertisements make them out to.In the end, it does clean the air, but it takes awhile to work without a fan."
2,"Similar to Ionic Breeze, but not quite ""silent"" (as claimed)","I got this because it was about $50 cheaper than a refurb ionic breeze. It seemed to do something - there was some crud collected on the blades - but I didn't notice any difference in the smell of the room really. Worse is that it has a very faint buzzing sound even when the blades are completely clean. It said that it is supposed to be completely silent on the box.I returned it for this reason and just received a refurb ionic breeze from Sharper Image today. Hopefully it will work better and will be silent (my friend has one and claims you can't hear a thing even if you put your ear on it, so hopefully that's true).If the manufacturer reads these reviews: please fix the buzzing and you'll have a decent product."
3,too soon to tell,Have had an Ionic Pro for about a month. The room air certainly smells cleaner. Don't know if this is from ozone or not. The filter blades begin to give out a slight sizzle after about a week of use. Booklet recommends cleaning every week. You have to lay it down horizontal to extract the blades. And a damp paper towel with some cleaner on it is best for removing the black build up on the blades. Then the instructions tell you to let the blades dry for 24hours. A bit inconvenient. Extra blades are $30.
2,"Extremely noisy, lots of work to clean, possibly dangerous!","I've had 2 of these for a few years. I've tried to make the best of them since they were so expensive. I've also bought new blades periodically.After a few months, the unit will make an extremely loud noise even after cleaning the blades. Buying new blades doesn't help. The screeching sounds is sometimes intermittent and sometimes constant. The only option is to use it in a room that you aren't in.I've tried vacuuming and cleaning the actual tower on the inside and blowing air inside it. It seems to help sometimes. I think that particles must get trapped inside, never release and cause the screeching.I didn't know this at the time, but have since learned about the dangerous ozone emittence of the product. And am now thinking that could be the cause of some of my health problems that I didn't have before?I'm not only disappointed with this product, I think it should be recalled and customers should be given refunds."
2,I don't recommend Ionic Pro.,"I bought two Ionic Pros awhile ago and am very disappointed. After they started making crackling noises, I cleaned the collection blades and tower as best as I could. When that didn't work, I called their customer service, who apparently are located in India. I was told the collection blades were defective and that I should buy new ones, which I did. The first set of collection blades sent to me didn't fit, nor did the next set they sent me. Finally the third set fit, but unfortunately didn't stop the crackling noise. Although I was told I would be refunded if it didn't work, I won't hold my breath waiting for the refund. I don't recommend Ionic Pro."
1,Doesn't work long enough to pay for itself,"I purchased the Ionic Pro in June 2007. While it worked it did help my allergies but the problem is it only worked until October and then the red time to clean light comes on the instant you turn it on and no amount of cleaning makes it work. When I called their customer service I was told they have no record of me buying one but if I want to send in $99.00 they will send me a new one and a gift of a small one. I don't want to buy another if the first one only worked a few months. I was told I had to take this deal during this phone call or it would never be offered again. I must say, I will never deal with this company again.CJW"
3,"Works, but ...","I bought two of these. I live near a heavy traffic street, and it gets filled with black particles every three of four days, and I believe my allergies and my son's are getting better.The problems:1. The power light is so bright that you do not need a night lamp to read.2. Good thing is that the power light stopped working after two days, I had to put some black tape on the other unit to have a dark room for sleeping.3. One of the two units I bought makes and extremely loud noise. I tried to change the blades from the other, but the problem seems to be in the unit and not the blades. Being outside the U.S., bad luck for me."
2,Buy an Ionic Breeze Instead,"I have an ionic breeze and an ionic pro, i wish i hadnt wasted my money on an ionic pro and got 2 ionic breezes. The Pro needs to be cleaned twice as frequently as the breeze, not becasue it collects more (actually it collects much less) but because it starts sparking in its chamber if theres a little dust on the collection grid. My breeze collects more, never sparks and works totally silently. Save yourself aggrevation go with the Ionic Breeze."
1,Dangerous for people with asthma,"My sister bought this unit for me for Christmas and I have asthma. Not knowing much about ionic air purifiers, except from the advertisements ontelevision, it seemed to be a good idea. I ran the machine for about 2 hours and got a bad headache and started to feel ill, also the machine emitted a bad smell while running it. (The plastic housing also smells bad). After reading the manual that came with it, it warns that you shouldcheck with your doctor if you have any medical problems, such as asthma, as the ozone that it emits is dangerous for people with asthma and other respitory problems. Consumer Reports magazine gave ionic air purifiers a bad review. (The headache went away when I turned off the machine and opened a window)"
3,air purifier,This air purifier is the same kind that I have in my bedroom but this one makes an annoying small noise when the purifier goes on.
3,Good but...,"Yes it works and yes you will sleep better. But it isn't easy to clean and mine broke down after about 2 years. I kept it on all day every day, so perhaps 2 years is all you can expect."
1,Horrendous,"The writing in this book lacks cohesion, purpose, and style. There is not any form of plot structure, nor development of sound character analysis. It appears that the author has written nothing but a trashy rendition of her view on life at the time. Unfortunate that something like this would even make it to print. Not worth a penny."
1,Did any of the previous reviewers actually read the book?,"The Doldrums was by the far the worst book I have ever read. The writing was sub-standard and the storyline was incohesive and poorly strung together. One gets the feeling this author is merely retelling highschool stories. If you need to read a good book about teenage angst, pick up the Outsiders."
3,"Cluttered, but useful","Most good programming books have clear examples and good Appendices.This book, unfortunately, decided to take the examples and the Appendix and shuffle them together.Code examples for the 'Note Taker' application are hard to follow on first read through. Too much detail is given for tag options (that should have been in appendices), and the example app is never displayed in full.It may just be me, but I learn quicker if I can see something practical and then have it explained. I can identify pieces of a puzzle much better if I know the context of each piece beforehand.It may be ""Rapid Application"" Development, but I'm afraid it isn't Rapid ""Application Development"" in my opinion. It's obviously written by someone with a deep understanding of Mozilla application development - I just wished that they had tested it on some Mozilla newbies and taken on board feedback before publishing!"
2,a bit disappointed,"As other readers pointed out,though this book has a lot of information it is a bit messy making it hard for completly newbies to the Moz platform. Every chapter took me one or more deep re-reading (which is not something I appreciated very much).The code provided is desperatly buggy (-3 stars) and only works with Mozilla 1.4 (precisly, 1.4.1 it won't work!). And as the author points out debbuging is not easy.Fact is, there's not many books around on the subject."
3,Other books are better,"I just finished this book, and find it to be poorly written, and carelessly laid out. At the end of each section there are comments by people who are ""in the industry"". These comments are repetitive to the subject covered in the pages prior, and it seems that either the authors writing was tailored to fit the ""industry experts"", or vice versa. The sample answers to the sample interview questions seem too cut and paste, and often site examples that are not applicable to most applicants.Not an awful book, but definitely not up to my standards."
4,Good High Level Read,"This book provides a very good intro on how to answer challenging questions. It could offered a larger variety of responses to account for the diversity of jobs, but still a good quick read."
3,Not as good as the reviewers have indicated,"I purchased this book about a year ago and put it to use in the last 2 weeks with 7 interviews. The feedback I gained from the reviewers was much better than most of the information I gleaned from the book.It is important that no one, while searching for a job, use the answers in the book. Apparently they are wrote and are fully expected by the interviewers. The real thing to learn from the book is to begin with an example but always lead into how you learned from whatever the incident was and bring that to what you have accomplished with what you learned.Overall I am not unhappy I bought the book, but it will not be a book I keep as a reference."
3,An OK book,"The examples given in the book use written language not spoken, making it hard as a reference. Certain content is redundant. Didn't get much from this book. It's better to find info. from website."
5,Good ol Rock n Roll,"If you like the music style of Jerry Lee Lewis, you are gonna love this one! It's rockin all night long!"
5,unexpected beauty,we only got it as amazon run out of a similar design with flowers - but when we saw it the minimalistic beauty of the product and the impeccable craftsmanship won out hearts
3,Pig Tails & Froglegs,This is a beautiful cook book with a very touching forward by Michael Jackson. Very fitting from him... in a cookbook about feeding the family and nurturing the children.I was however very disappointed in the packaging and shipping of the book. There was not enough protection and the cook book was dinged and marred in the shipping process.
5,Highly recommend it!,"This book has no pictures or fancy illustrations, however it contains recipes that you will love to make over and over again and recipes you will be excited to try next! I am a culinary arts student and I can really appreciate recipes that turn out excellent products without having to tweak them! This book is perfect for those who love to try interesting combinations of flavors as well as traditional ones. Directions are very clear and SIMPLE to follow! As the title indicates, cookies are CHEWY and SOFT... This is a ""fun"" book to have on hand for fail proof cookies in no time!"
3,Good reference,This book was not quite what I expected. It assumes that you are already an accomplished cookie baker (I am) and gives recipes that are quite tempting but no methods on mixing. It does offer a few tips on here an there but I would not recommed this book for a novice cookie baker
4,My son loves this watch,The only problem with this watch is that it is a little hard to open. The wistle in the tin gift set is tiny. But the watch works and my son enjoys it.
3,Only for Bosch,"Good quality construction, seems well built, but will not work on any other brand rotary hammer drill except Bosch. Thats the reason for 3 star. Had to order the Dewalt brand spline to sds adapter, which will work with any brand rotary hammer."
5,flawless,I received the speakers very quickly. I love them. They sound great! The best speakers I have ever owned. I can hardly believe the price was so low. Research and listen to these speakers before you spend a mint on any others!
5,Great Bandaids!,Bandaids like these are hard to find. They stick all around the wound and don't gap like other bandaids. They flex nice with your finger and last for days before they fall off. And the price is right for the amount you get. They come in so many sizes it's hard to choose which ones to keep in stock. I highly recommend these bandaids to mothers with children and wives whose husbands are always coming to you for first aid.
3,Clermont,A good gothic plot. Typical herione who faints at least 20 times thru-out the story. I felt all in all it was a good read if you can bear the histronics which are quite consistent all through the novel.
5,I got the last one,"So glad they offer this filter. Mine gets used every night, and after a couple months, is pretty oily. I mainly use Lavender, but have experimented some, and it's time to replace it. The vanilla stained my filter! Don't think it matters, but a clean one will be nice."
5,work great,"easy install, and easy to add more oil. I havent tryed to change scents yet but it is easy to do"
3,You want the banned video?,"I pre-ordered this CD in advance just so I could get the video for (s)AINT. As far as I know, it was the only way to get it.I enjoy the video collection, even though the video for ""Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes is not on it.I also would say that I do not consider most of the songs on the albnum to be ""greatest hits"", though that may be the cruel irony of Marilyn Manson. I know I would have done it differently myself."
2,Beware!,"For some reason no one seems to have had a problem with this DVD, but I did. I bought this item primarily for the DVD so I could watch the videos, but it does not work in my DVD player. It keeps saying it's a different region code. (In other words I got ripped off.) Luckily the CD is fine and I can listen to the music which is nice.But beware when buying this item-- the DVD may not work in your player and it would be a shame losing your money."
3,XTC-Lite,"There is something weirdly unfocussed about this album. The music and the lyrics seem to have been pieced together to form a set of songs which meander along nicely enough but failed to evoke any sort of emotion in me. Also, I found all the electronic bells and whistles jarring which I never did with Beck (with whom they seem to be getting compared, as if)."
4,Patchy,"A date played ""You Got the Style"" for me (it worked), which inspired me to find the whole CD. At best, Vehicles & Animals is fun, uplifting and catchy, but after a while the sing-song quality of many of the songs starts to sound the same and it gets a little monotonous. It's a shame to say it, because I love ""You Got the Style"" and ""Salvador,"" but I don't think the album is anything special, unless you want some mellow, cheerful background music."
2,Support wing/chop saw stand,"If you need to do many duplicate cuts under 20"", i guess toll is ok....But it really is hard to asemble/use with any ease..Most of the Rouseau Products were good. But reall missed the mark as far as what we expected...Saw support doesn't really work as described...But is better tham most"
4,classic Buk,"A must-have for any serious collection of Bukowski's poetry. Contains some earlier work previously released in chap books in the Sixties. The poems are generally classic Buk material; if you're a fan of his work as I am, you'll find a lot of good stuff here. Get hold of the book, rip open a beer, and start reading..."
3,an ok collection from bukowski,"not the greatest of work. i felt the collection disjointed--not that the book needs ot have a theme, but i felt this work not to be as powerful as others. it contains the least amount of saved/marked poems that i will go back and re-read"
5,"Hank to his friends, Charles on the page",When I was first discovering the works of Charles Bukowski this book was a favorite; re-reading it again after many years I find it is still a very strong collection. This ranks up there with Love Is a Dog from Hell as some of his best work.
3,Early Buk; not the Buk that turns me on,"I've read several of Buk's books of short stories and poetry, and this is the earliest of Buk's work that I've read. I almost want to say ""YUK!""This book has more obvious attempts at style, metaphor... fancy stuff that I'm not used to Buk feeding me. I like his later stuff (e.g., Betting on the Muse; The Prettiest Woman in town).The later stuff is unrelenting. Raw. That's the Buk I've some to love. Burning in Water Drowining in Flame gets distracting with its attempts at being fancy."
3,Incomplete soundtrack,"The soundtrack is really good but incomplete...They based all the movie marketing on Guns N' Roses ""You could be Mine"" song, including in the trailer and they don't put it in the soundtrack, a lot of good songs heard in the movie are not on the sound track...."
2,Only Two Good Tracks,"I bought this CD almost solely because of the last track (""It's Over""), which IS excellent. The first track (""Main Title"") is good (memorable), too. Otherwise, there's nothing outstanding on this. That's not to say the music doesn't work well for enhancing the mood of the Terminator 2 movie, but for stand-alone listening pleasure? Only the two aforementioned tracks are any good.Simply put, what I got wasn't worth what I paid. Thus, I would NOT recommend you spend your money on this unless you have a strong penchant for movie soundtracks."
2,Redundant,"The most obvious problem with the score to Terminator 2 is that it is redundant. It consists of loud metallic clangs and late 80's/early 90's synthezized noises, and that's about it. It is without strings, percussion, or any real noticeable brass instruments. Scores can be done well with this sort of style (see the thrilling Speed score) but this one is just boring. It doesn't lend excitement or thrills to the action-all it does is give off a sense of menace about the machines. But the ultimate question is wether or not it serves the movie. Well, I definately think that if the music had more personality, the movie's action sequences would have been even more thrilling, but that's just me. Overall, this CD is not worth a purchase by any means."
1,Lack of Information in Catalog,"I received the Cheeter PN 10101 thinking it would work with my Porter Cable Extra Heavy Duty framing saw, only to discover that the guide works only for blade-on-right saws, and mine is a blade-on-left. The only way to do 90-degree cuts is by clamping the guide on the other side of the board, and the cut is made so that the guide is being pushed out of alignment. The catalog should state that the guide is for blade-on-right saws only! If there is a blade-on-left version available, please let me know."
2,Another dust collector,A tool that you'll likely stuff under a shelf and find once or twice a year while moving around the tools that are practicle.
1,hard to trust for a square cut,"Have not even bothered to use it, just returning. It is supposed to ""lock"" into place to give you a 90o cut guide, but the alignment holes are off for the dimples that are suppose to fit in the holes, so it never ""locks"" into place. The only way I would trust that is was square would be to use a right angle to check for square. Mine was hard to set at 90o using just my hands (does not rotate smoothly). However, when using it, it would be easy for the saw to push it slightly out of alignment because there is no way to lock it at a set angle.Elimination of the 90o alignment holes/dimples and the addition of some kind of real lock that was accurate would be good."
2,Not for me,I am fair skinned and had a very decent tan before I ordered this product but when I would put it on it would literally burn my skin for hours. This product is def better suited for someone w/out sensative skin. Smelled amazing tho!
2,not too sure what all the hype is about,"i've used a lot of different tanning lotions in the years that i've tanned and i was not very impressed with this one. i've heard great things about the 'new' OC line of tanning lotions, and purchased it based on the reviews on amazon.com. i just didn't get the great results that others seem to have noticed. perhaps it's more of a level one lotion. the smell was just okay - nothing too strong, and there was no 'after tan' smell. after my purchse, i spoke with the owner if the tanning salon i go to and asked her more about the OC line (which apparently i should have done before my first amazon tanning product purchase) and she'd commented that more people seemed to like the 'over night celebrity' and 'show off' a lot better than the 10X. oh well, you don't know until you try =)"
4,Pretty good,"This product works excellent. If your looking for a good bronzer that helps you develop good color, this is a great choice. My only complaint about the product is the smell. It doesn't smell Bad, but compared to other better smelling tanning lotions, its lack-of good smell doesn't help the experience. If you don't care about scent, its a great choice, easy to apply, goes a long way!"
4,Works great!,"I really like this product. Not sticky and dosen't leave a residue. Does leave a little bit of an aftersmell, but gives a great deep bronze. Will buy again."
1,will not purchase again,I am not happy with product. will leave orange spots on your feet and hands if you do not rub in all lotion.
3,don't rip cut,"I purchased the PRAZI PR2000 Beam Cutter for the expressed purpose of ripping 8' x 8"" x 8"" western red cedar beams down to 7"" x 7"" and for saddle notching the top of the beams to accept a 4"" x 6"" lintel. I found the PR2000 did a fine job on cross cuts but was not suitable for the end grain rip cuts. The tool became very difficult to control and hold on line and the tear-out is completely unacceptable. I am sure there are applications where this tool shines but for my saddle cuts and ripping applications in this particular material (Western Red Cedar) it receives a failing grade from me."
1,just not good.,"I use these reviews,so feel obligated to comment. I bought one of these to cut tenon joints for timber framing. I might as well have just used a chainsaw. NOT accurate at all. As another review noted, makes a chainsaw cut. That would be fine, IF it could cut straight. saw guide is just too flimsy, it flexes. I know it sounds like a good, inexpensive way to cut timber, and it does cut like a chainsaw, just doesnt cut straight like you most likely want. It can cut fast though!"
3,An alternative,"I do not own this attachment and am not opposed to it, but in comparing options I stumbled upon this technique:[...]"
1,need info and parts,"the first day when i tried to bolt it to my saw, the nut that holds the chain to the saw broke off in the saw, now the saw and the parzi is useless."
2,Not dark enough,"Even with toner savings mode turned off and dark turned up all the way, it's still too light. Yes, I've tried 1 2nd cartridge, namebrand. Just having to turn the toner saver off and select dark means every single printout you have to click-click-click.The paper just hangs out, bent, and over time gets permanently bent. The plastic holders are exposed and break easily."
4,Decent printer for the Money,I have owned the ML-2010 for 4yrs and bought 3 toner cartridges for it so I have printed 1000's of sheets. It's a budget printer and does not print as clear as the professional Cannon units we have at work but its perfect for home use and I have never had any issues with quality of prints. My kids use it for school and I use it for email or whatever. I have got good use out of this machine and it was well worth the $99 I paid 4 yrs ago.Pros: -Prints fast and text looks good.-Toner lasts me over a year @ 1000 prints or so.-paper sits flat in bottom so it does not curl.Cons: -It does not hold much paper. I have to load it all the time.-This last year its started to jam and mis-feed a lot. might be time to retire it.-Toner is getting expensive now that this printer is obsolete.
2,Re: Got what I paid,"After a year of light use, it started to jam so ofter that I wanted to trash it. But I still have a spare toner sitting there. Sigh. It helps if you push the paper a bit when it feeds. But it is annoying. Not recommend for any usage. Two stars for the price I paid. Otherwise, one star."
4,Perfect home office printer,Samsung has produced an excellant laser printer with this model. Affordably priced and easy to install and use.
3,"Good for what it is, but its NOT NETWORKABLE","I bought this printer because I needed a small ethernet laser printer. I ended up with this one because it was small and cheap, had good reviews, and the Samsung web page said it had an optional ethernet adapter. So once I bought it, I searched around to find the ethernet adapter. Finally I emailed Samsung and they said their site was wrong. So, as great as this printer is for a USB printer, I bought it because it was advertised as a networkable printer, and it is not."
3,Good for Mac but LOUD,"I purchased this printer a few years ago. After downloading the drivers from the Samsung site, I've had no issues with this printer. It seems that with many printers, the claims of compatibility are minimal compared with what is offered to the Windows OS.The only complaint with this printer is that it is very, very loud. I also understand that it's an energy hog as well. I would still be using it, but a lightning storm, even when connected to a surge protector, fried it."
2,Value printer with questionable performance,"With the price, I figured I didn't have much to lost with this printer. I was just looking for a decent laser printer to print black and white documents w/no graphics. I was disappointed to learn that ALL text that is supposed to be black prints medium gray instead. It's as if the entire document is ""grayed out"". Today I still print my black and white docs on my inkjet. The speed is a bit slower, but the quality doesn't look like a 15-year-old dot matrix in draft mode. In addition to the poor output quality, the printer is loud enough to wake my children, so it joined my power tools in the list of equipment I can only use before 9pm. Save yourself the cash - look elsewhere."
1,A very erratic printer,"I purchased 2 of these printers and they have both stopped working. The first just quit within 6 months. The second started out OK, then began stopping while printing in the middle of the page then stopped working all together. I won't buy this model again."
4,Decent Home Laser Printer,"I have now owned the ML-2010 for about 6 months. During that time I have been pleasantly surprised by it. It is a decently economical, fast, and attractive printer. While I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wanted to print graphics, this is an excellent printer for the home office."
4,Samsung ML-2010,"A great value. I found it a bit noisy at times, but really fast and inexpensive. The toner saver for non-critical documents is a great way to save toner costs. It is a perfect small home office printer."
4,Fits the bill for a limited budget,"My wife prints her students' papers at home so it was time to dedicate a laser printer to the task. For our limited budget, this fits the bill quite nicely. Pros/Cons: It doesn't support USB 2.0 and the long warm up time is kind of frustrating (""Did I click print??? Oh yeah, there it goes."") Once it gets going, the pages come out quickly. It is louder than most other laser printers, but not louder than some ink jets. And yes, the room lights flicker when it fires up. No joke. Not worth the price without a rebate, and the price seems to be on the rise. Samsung has replaced this with a later model, and I can only hope that they'll support this one for a full lifecycle (although the cost of toner replacement rivals the purcahse price of the printer!). You can also get a Dell laser printer for around $99."
4,Great printer for the price!!!,I bought this printer a few months ago and it has been great. It prints really fast and the quality is pretty good. It is a little bit loud when it is printing. It isnt that big of a deal to me because it prints so fast. Once it finishes printing it is silent though. But if you are in an office or something and are printing things all day long I would probably not recomend this printer. I really like the toner save feature also. This printer is very economical and I would recomend it to anyone who wants to save money.
2,Paper Jam! Paper Jam! Near Toner Cartridge!,"Despite the title, there are no paper jams. Instead - after about 6 months - the unit just tells me that there is a paper jam, when there isn't, every time I try to print something. I only paid about $80 for it, but I was hoping it would last a little longer."
1,VERY POOR PRINTING QUALITY - SAMSUNG ML-2010,"I never write reveiws, but in this case I had to: the quality of the printing was so poor. Like other reviewers, it prints grey not black no matter what you do. Also, there's banding. Plus, you get nowhere near 3,000 pages with the toner. Also, I saw no difference between the 1200 and 600 dpi setting. It also disturbed my power source.What else can I say? Samsung should be ashamed of turning out such a poor machine. Too bad there are not lemon laws for laser printers."
1,Prints in Grey,"This is a nice looking printer with a small footprint. It is better than the average home laser printer in terms of speed, noise and operational cost per page. If you can live with grey print, then this is for you. However, I need black print and this printer won't deliver. This is my second machine and it has the same problem. The only remedy Samsung Tech Support offered was to exchange my new printer for a used one at my shipping expense. And, they did so with an irritating attitude.I will never buy another laser printer without seeing the output in person. the 2010 is a great machine except for its printed output and the support. How unfortunate."
3,Buy something else.,"Print quality is good but not too much better than my old HP Deskjet 600C. Due to the heat inside the machine, the copies are curled up & don't lay flat even after days on the desk. I can't undestand how you can purchase a brand new printer including the print cartridge for less than the price of a replacement print cartridge. Something is wrong here. Why buy a cartridge when you can get a brand new printer for less.Noisy & doesnt include USB cable."
4,Good printer considering its price,"I bought this printer because of its cheap price, but it turn out to be very good. It was easy to install, and print quality is reasonably good. One drawback is loud noisy, but it didn't bother me much."
3,"Cheap, but noisy","This printer is a true joy for bargain hunters (like myself). The mail in rebate process is somewhat of a pain, but for 50 bucks off it's worth it. The printer is easy to set up and it's very compact. The print quality and speed are good. For those who are complaining about missing cables: this is an old issue. By now, most of us have had a printer, so why not use the old cable? If you want cheap, then forget about the extras. However, the seller should provide the customer with this information.My problem with this printer is the noise level (from the fan). I find it intolerable for use in a home or working environment. The only relief is that it stops when the printer goes into power saving (after some 5 minutes). I would have tried to return the printer, had it been over a 100 $. The price is 5 *, but the noise issue has a substanial impact on my rating of this product/offer."
4,Good to introduce,"The good thing is it is so fast to print than I expected. Bad thing is the color of letter is not so dark even though I made it dark in the setting. And it's hard to print both sides because I have to do first for front pages and then do back pages later. It makes me confused. Another thing is all languge for setting the program is Korean. I am Korean but how other persons can make setting the soft program. However, generally, I am so satisfied with this materials. Especially, the price is so attractive and fancy and small shape. It's encourageable."
1,"I like Samsung, but I won't be buying another printer from them...","This is a cheap printer, but not worth it. It runs out of toner quickly, and it's really slow (I'm used to HP III, 4MV, etc...). It quit feeding envelopes unless I pushed by hand and you've gotta push them at just the right second. Last week, after trying to print the same envelope 12 times, I took the printer out into the parking lot to see how high I could throw it. This was my most satisfying moment with this printer..."
1,False advertising,I was never informed that I was getting refurbished printers. When I complained I didn't receive an answer for over a week. Then the answer said that I may return them but only if they didn't work. I am disgusted with AMAZON and will never order from AMAZON again.
1,Jams,"Jams. Jams. Jams. Jams. I had read that this thing is prone to jams. But I couldn't resist the price. I've had it out of the box for 12 hours and can't get it to print. Because every time I print, it jams. Buy something else."
4,Sumsung printer,"This is a very good printer for the small price. What I hate most is the refill catridges often cost more than the printer itself. When are machine builders becoming more reasonable and sensible to consumer needs. Yes, refills are neccessary but its more like gauging the customer than providing a reputable machine. For instance, the Konica/Minolta Pagepro is $99 with a $50 rebate. The catridge is $74 plus tax. What's wrong with this picture. How can a refill catridge costs more than the machine. In this case, the Samsung printer is identical. $105 for the printer with a $50 rebate but the refill catridge is $70 plus. Ouch."
3,Come'On!,"Mine didn't come with the usb a/usb b cable...How stupid is that not to include all the needed cables...come 'on amazon and samsung, get with the program. How the H*** was I supposed to know I needed to shell out another $20 bucks for a stupid cable that should be included. BOO!"
5,Reliable even for Mac users,"I've had this printer for a few months now, and its absolutely wonderful. Crisp print and very fast. No problems as yet!"
1,Inferior quality,You could not print 3 pages continously without jamming ( the printer would pick up 2 to 3 pages from the paper tray at the same time and end up jam itself ). The only way to get around is to manually feed the paper one by one. I have noticed this problem ever since I got it as a gift( it's the reason I did not return it ). I think it's a product design flaw.I hope anyone who is thinking about buying this printer see this message.
4,Samsung printer,good quality print for cost. only complaints is that the paper tray isn't deep enough to hold more than 50 sheets of paper. It occasionally jams and the paper feed doesn't have a release for the paper jam so you have to fight to pull it out. I am fairly satisfied otherwise as I only use it for school to print up notes and papers.
3,Sunil,"It is a good printer for the price I guess. But if you ever need to print on envelopes, buy something else, because it is a tremendous pain to do so with this printer. It takes about 60 seconds to print a single envelope and you must feed the envelopes one at a time, because any more than one envelope in the envelope slot will jam it up. Otherwise, the quality of print is good, but it could definitely be less frustrating to use."
1,A total waste of money,"This printer worked fine for about 2 months and then I had one paper jam, which seemed to clear easily enough. But the ""error"" LED never cleared, despite turning the printer off, waiting 15 minutes, turning it back on, resetting the network connection, reinstalling the printer on my computer, removing and reinstalling the toner cartridge, etc.... Now the printer is completely unusable. I wouldn't bother repairing it even if someone came to my house. It is going in the garbage (well, to the hazard waste recycling) and being replaced by an HP."
2,leaves smudges on resume paper,"I got this printer to print official correspondence on, mainly resumes. However, every so often (every 20 pages?) I don't know why it leaves a dirty mark. Usually a smudge at the top. I have to print again and dump my expensive resume paper. Quite annoying. Also, keep in mind these small laser printers tend not to be as dark as inkjets. I got mine for $[...] after rebate, so look around for that deal."
3,"OK, but there are better values out there.","Tried this printer. Not impressed at all. Quality not as good my previous one (Konica Minolta PagePro 1400W). Samsung is noisy and the replacement catridge is definitely more expensive than Minolta's.Samsung electronic products are cheaper than name brands, but the quality is not that good. You get what you pay for."
3,ML-2010 Laser,"The printer was easy enough to set up, but the picture quality, especially printing photos is fair to poor...in addition the main reason I bought this was to print on Vellum and Cardstock for my daughter's wedding invites which she had designed. The fee mechanism jammed about every 10 pages of vellum, and the cardstock would be inexorably curled up after feeding thru the printer...great for printing regular text pages as well as low res graphics...would probably buy a higher end LaserJet printer with an ejection out the back of the printer so the curling would be alleviated."
3,Decent soundtrack to funny action film,"This record features the type of music well suited to an action film; it's nothing great, but it's not bad either. Also includes the classic hits ""Runaround Sue"" and ""Big Girls Don't Cry""."
5,For Mantovani lover's only,"This is wonderful relaxing music. While I prefer modern jazz, my wife plays this day and night so I made sure she had a large and original recordings. The soothing sounds allows us to perform and focus on other tasks in a very tranquil environment."
4,Great Fireside Music!,This cd collection is a great fireside companion. Great music for relaxing on a lazy night!
1,"Boring, sad","This isn't quite ""music"" - it's closer to the kind of bloodless, overproduced orchestral music made popular in the 50s and 60s for older people who lacked a background in the classics, yet enjoy sentimental easy listening. This sort of thing has long been replaced by the likes of easy rock and easy listeing jazz, though it's possible that there are still listeners who haven't been exposed to much else, or otherwise have depressed standards in their popular music. Even Lawrence Welk had more variety and personal style in his presentation of music for older people.This isn't even nostalgic anymore - just dull."
4,Where's the soundtrack?,"This movie is it, It has a steamy plot that will push you to the edge of your seat cursing at the screen.I would recommend it to anyone.Not to mention that the gorgeous Shemar Moore stars in it!!Just a little bummer, why isn't the soundtrack available?"
4,Good film!,"Since the beginning Motives keeps you wondering, it's a sexy thriller with an ending that no one should tell you, actually you must see it for yourself. It's interesting, with good rhytm and it's not that long... and not that expensive :)A perfect film to stay at home, with popcorn and cold outside :)"
3,Suspense and a Love Triangle,"Emery (played by Shemar Moore) has it all. Money, a great career, and a beautiful wife named Constance (Viveca Fox). He could lose it all by having an affair with a beautiful temptress named Allanah (Goldyn Brooks). The movie is a suspense thriller. The movie is about Love, Betrayal, and making decisions that you will later regret. The movie has you wondering who is trying to play who, the person that you think is doing the playing ends up getting played. I enjoyed the movie. It's a decent movie. One I will watch again."
2,Don't waste the two hours of your life.,"I didn't think that the movie was going to be Oscar-worthy when I bought it, but it was even worse than my expectations. If a permanent pout and useless dialogue is your cup of tea, enjoy. As for me, I'll watch Criminal Minds for free."
3,For Fans of Shemar Moore,"This is a thriller that is low on intelligent scripting but high on grit and edginess. Good for males who want to sit down with the guys, have a couple of beers, and not be challenged."
4,REQUEST A SOUNDTRACK,"There is no formal soundtrack and alot of the songs are not available anywhere else.I found a way to contact Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment via Sony Pictures. With enough E-mails, maybe we can convince them to release a soundtrack. Here's the address: WebSiteTech@sonypictures.com.Let's hope this works"
4,Motives,"I don't know how many of you have seen this wonderful movie. I have seen it! Insightful independent film set amongst an ensemble cast of characters, starring Shemar Moore and lovely Vivica A. Fox. The dubious Emery Simms (Shemar Moore) embarks on a sinister course, secret rendezvous leading to blackmail and murder. His reputation seems to precede himself, a beautiful wife home and career. He tried to represent but to no avail hunted and captured by the game."
4,Nothing is as it seems,"I must say although Shemar is good to look at, I don't like to see Bro acting cause I don't think he has anything except the right look. Ok with that said I did like this movie, the way it unfolded in different ways kept you completely on edge a very intriguing twist."
5,A must see,This movie was off the hook. Ms. Fox need to win an award for this movie. Everyone should see it.
4,"My, My, my","This movie kept me intrigued from the very start, first with the star power and then with the revelations that started to unfold. It is definitely one for your collection, short enough to share with company and not take all night and something to start a good conversation about relationships!"
3,So-So,"Motives has a lot of problems like a very loose plot and at times unconvincing characters. Luckily the leads ( Shemar Moore and Vivica Fox ) hold it together. Golden Brooks did nothing but bring a string of annoying scenes to a film that would have been much better if it had focused more on the plot instead of style and flash. It's a typical drama urban style. A married man has an affair which leads to dangerous consequences. No more, no less. This has been done thousands of times, way better I might add but still this film is watchable. Don't expect too much because it's a little on the cheap side, but if you like the main characters you'll survive. Intead of naming this film Motives it should have been named Unbelievable. Who in their right mind would cheat on Vivica Fox? And with Golden Brooks...sorry couldn't buy that one bit, no matter how you wrote it."
5,Fine flick,"As a Shemar Moore fan, I rented this movie, not expecting much of a movie I had never heard of. I was pleasantly surprised. Fine acting and loved the plot including the surprise ending."
2,it's ok,"The sound isn't very good, and it came apart after a few weeks. But it's just a toy so I guess it was worth it"
2,Sounds bad,I have a plastic recorder that I bought (around $20) that sounds way better than this one. This one just looks like the manufacturing might be a little sloppy (like they didn't get all the wood sanded down and smoothed out on the inside) and I think it is negatively effecting the sound quality. Glad it was just for my two year old to blow in while I played my other one...
4,"Nice instrument for a young child, but not very durable","I bought this recorder for my two and a half-year-old and he loves it. I chose it because it was the cheapest wood recorder I could find. My son loves playing with it in a variety of creative ways and tries to make music with it. He would rate it 5 stars.I rate it slightly lower because the sound is disappointing and because the instrument is already breaking. I find it very hard to play the low C and D notes clearly, and the sound of the instrument is generally weak. The varnish is coming off wherever my son puts the instrument in his mouth. After two months of almost constant play, the top part has developed a 3 inch long crack, partly because the bottom part swells when wet and stretches the top part when reassembling. Because it comes apart, my son disassembles it constantly and bangs the two ends together and blows on all the ends."
1,Doesn't work,"It doesn't change notes when you cover different holes. I am no expert, but isn't the sound supposed to change when you add fingers to the holes? Also, the sound the instrument makes is annoying--it just seems more shrill than it is supposed to."
3,Works but not all notes,"We bought this for our toddler to learn to blow and hear music. While it does the basic job of making notes, I can't say it's very reliable. When I cover some of the holes, it doesn't necessarily change the sound. When I play the same holes a different time, they do affect the pitch. I'm not sure if there's a big seal between the two pieces of the recorder.The other thing I dislike is that the lacquer on the mouth piece has already worn off. We've only had it a few months and don't play with it every day.It's entertaining for a small child but not a good choice if you actually want to play tunes regularly."
1,"crack, broke apart, did not keep tune","i bought this for my 3 year old son because he likes to make sounds and blow on things (kazoo, harmonica, saxoflute). i read some of the poor reviews so i tried it out first-- the pitch was off and didn't change as well as you might think from covering various holes, which was puzzling. i gave it to my son anyway, as i figured he wouldn't really care about that stuff. well, in just a few days there was a noticeable crack in the top part of it, and eventually it just fell off. definitely not durable. i've since glued it back on with wood glue. we'll see! also, i wish melissa and doug would use less plastic in their packaging."
1,Sounded Horrible!,"If you plan on using this as kindling for a fire, or to wedge open the door while you move boxes in/out, or some other unintended use, then it works great. BUT if you are buying this to introduce your child to music, I recommend spending a couple dollars more and getting a real recorder. This one SOUNDED TERRIBLE. Half of the notes/holes did not work properly, and most of the notes that did work were off (sharp or flat). Big waste of money and time."
2,"A fun toy, but does not last long.","The recorder's head area developed a huge crack after one day of my four year old son's hard playing. Never dropped, banged on something or anything like that. The product seems to be made of very poor quality wood."
3,"Im not sure that I ""get"" this album.........","Well this is without a doubt the strangest thing Zappa ever did . Overall the music is a little arty and unlike his other work I cant figure out for the life of me what FZ was trying to turn into satire (or rather the subject of). This is NOT something you would want to give a friend and tell them ""yeah this was what zappa was like""."
3,A strange collage,"This is one of the weirder Zappa outings (and that is saying a lot). It consists of snippets of people talking intercut by music. The music is of course great and represents the first time Zappa recorded with an orchestra. As for the talking it might be interesting the first time but the next time you just want to push the fast forward button on your cd player and skip to the music. Now Zappa made other cds wit talking (thing-fish, joe's garage) but on those cds the talking was meant to explain the story of the album. The talking on Lumpy Gravy is pretty much about nothing and is not very amusing. This is another album that is more for true fans than for the casual ones."
2,"The ""Lumpy Gravy CD "" I Think more or Less.","I think Frank Zappa musician genius, but some discs are more or less. The Lumpy Gravy is one."
3,"Interesting collage, but needs a bit more MUSIC!","First things first. To the kid from Staten Island: yeah, your kind won't listen to this, but this type of stuff isn't half of what Zappa did.For those who haven't heard a Zappa album but want to hear music, get Apostrophe NOW, then proceed through Zappa 60+ album catalogue as you see fit.Now the album is mostly irrelevant, unintelligible conversation. We do get a few snippets of noise here and there, then that's about it. At the end of Part 2, though, is a little groovy, 60's inspired surf jam. In fact, that's the only real music that's played.Still, an original concept by the late, modern-day composer. If you're willing to pluck down the money, and a Zappaphile, get it."
5,Bull Dada Insanity,"This is not ""nice"" rock and roll Zappa, with the goof ball lyrics and ten minute solos. This is full music concrete, at least as it is practiced by junior college dropouts from the high desert of California. Prepare to get hit with a layered club sandwich of styles: Stravinsky, Varese, doo-wop, acid rock freak-out, often within the same bar. I wouldn't call anything on here a song, in fact I think you could drop in at any moment and it would make as much sense as starting at the beginning. But that's the charm. I've had friends complain that this is a difficult album, but I'm not so sure. Zappa got his hands on a studio, and a impressively large group of competent and willing musicians, two tools he struggled with his entire career. This is the sound a fiercely iconoclastic and talented musician putting his favorite toys through their paces. Wonderful, weird album."
4,An attention grabber,"Sometimes the dialogue snippets go on a little bit too long, but overall this is a masterful interweaving of classical-music dissonance, pop-music goofery, found sounds and truly bizarre conversations. Edgard Varese would have approved.But besides all that, there's one thing that makes this album absolutely essential.Three words:Louie the Turkey."
5,Mini Mcaw LOVES it!,"Excellent food! Owner of this Canadian company came to speak at our Long Island Parrot Society. I was really impressed at the science that goes into the manufacture of this food. Samples were given out........my bird loves it, and it is really healthy and natural."
5,Easy for my grey hold,"This size is perfect for my African grey to hold and eat. Unlike some brands, all the pellets are the same colour so he won't be picky about which colour he wants to eat. Has a really nice fruity smell and he gets fruit breath after eating it. I've been giving this to him for 6 years and he's still strong and healthy"
5,a sweet little book,"I found this for my daughter (14 and we just moved--her boyfriend broke up with her and started seeing one of her friends from home--she's devestated!) I looked all over for a really good relationship book for girls and this is it. Really sweet, kind hearted and I loved the writer's style--thanks so much for helping my baby, it's nice to see her smil and say Mom, I'm SO over him! I'm planning to buy anything else this writer (I think it's a woman, but has a different name???? must be!!!) writes, but I haven't found much for my kids age group (her other books are for younger) Thanks!"
1,pen will not write ink is horrible order dozen only one out of dozen work.,Bad product will not write ink clogged ordered a dozen only one pen worked. I am very disappointed with this product.
3,sub-standard,"It's not easily cleaned and can easily become gross from the type of toy it is. Also, the noise that it did make was sub-standard. I was very disappointed in this product as M&D items are usually fantastic."
1,Kazoo,Will never buy this product not good for kids. My daughter was unable to use it.Too difficult even for me.
3,a present for my sister.,"I was dissapointed this was mass produced in China,but that was my fault for not looking into it further.We got a good laugh out of it(for my sisters's 57th birthday) because it replaced a metal one we all used as teenagers.I really thought I was supporting an American couple.Oh well.It made her laugh and that's all that REALLY counts."
2,Why wood?,"I know Melissa and Doug toys are typically made of wood, but this does not seem to be a logical choice for a kazoo. I bought a Melissa and Doug Harmonica for my son that is fantastic (and not made of wood). It does not make sense to me to have a toy made of porous wood that is intended to be placed in a child's mouth from a cleanliness point of view. In my opinion the sound out of this kazoo is not very good as well."
2,Doesn't sound like a kazoo,"I was excited to purchase a wood kazoo, thinking it would better for my 1 1/2 because it wasn't plastic. But it just doesn't sound good."
2,Kazoo,The kazoo is high quality but my 4 year old daughter can not play it and either can I. My husband is the only one that can get it to make any noise. I had expected it to be much easier to play since it is rated for 3 and up.
1,Don't Buy (Huge M&D fan by the way),"Normally love anything and everything by M&D, but this toy is CRAP. Read: doesn't work at all. Couldn't get it to make any noise and the unfinished wood hurts the mouth. Didn't read the other reviews and should have. Defective product. Not worth the cost to send back, so it is now in the trash."
3,"Wooden Kazoo, could be better...Not very loud...Although as a parent that could be a plus!","I have really been wanting a kazoo for my kids to play with and I bought them these for a gift. It LOOKS like it would be awesome. It's a great size for fat toddler fingers to grab and the wood is soft and smooth. The part where it lacks luster is the noise making...It's just not that loud. The cheapo brass $1 kazoos are way better, but I do still like this one because it's safe for my toddler, and the brass ones wouldn't be."
1,sound hardly comes out.,"It's really hard to blow and make noise (which is the point). I bought this because my daughter loves them and it barely works. It easier for an adult to figure out, but overall it's no good. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Don't Buy Power Pack 2001,"Aug. 17, 2001 Webster's Gold Encyclopedia, the Food Lover's Encyclopedia, and the rest are apparently no longer being supported with an on-line site. Used to be you inserted the CD, called up the program and then you had a choice of browsing what you had off-line; updating the books, or recipes; or going on-line and browsing there.I just tried updating, and going on-line with Food Lovers, and the misnamed New Millennium Encyclopedia and got zap, nada, nothing. When I tried contacting tech support listed on the Food Lovers CD, I got the Pearson home page, saying that Macmillian is now Pearson, and there's absolutely nothing there at all about this CD, or any other in the pack.What a rip-off. We just bought the set a couple months ago, and certainly didn't expect this."
5,concise and practical,"As an EE student in CMOS VLSI design, I find that this book is very useful to erase the gap between the classic CMOS digital/analog design textbooks and journals, such as IEEE J. solid state circuits. Chapter 3 Array architecture is particularly interesting. Strongly recommend this book to the students who are interested in pursuing a career in CMOS VLSI design."
4,Good diaper bag,"I used this diaper bag for the first several months after having my son. I soon realized that I needed a bag with a zipper top and now have a backpack type diaper bag. This bag is very well made, nice cushioning on the changing pad and loved the design. It has lots of pockets and is very handy."
4,Fish love it,"I have two bettas and a 10 gallon tank stocked with minnows and all of my fish really enjoy the food. My apartment-mate got a very small female betta that kept regurgitating the pellets she fed her, so we fed her Bettamin and the fish loved it. It is easy for them to eat and they particularly like the light orange bits (shrimp?). The only downsides are: if you don't know how to feed your fish properly they will get the water dirty and that they give red tints to the fish (which is annoying if you have a fish that doesn't have red hues)."
2,My Betta's Wont Even Touch These...,"It makes the water cloudy and my bettas won't even touch it, they'll try a few but spit it back out and eventually it all falls to the bottom."
1,Classic B Movie,"If I had spent mor on this movie I would have been upset. As it is, it is a classic of the genre, and you get what you pay for with these movies."
5,The Man with the X-Ray Eyes,"Top Movie, Great Classic.They need to make a modern version of this movie."
5,Family favourite!,"We bought this for our daughters birthday this year, and it has become a family favourite. The kids love both playing the game, as well as making patterns on it with the beads. We like how simple the design is, and how portable it is. Much nicer than Connect Four."
5,Video purchases,"I need these movies for work as demonstrations . I was surprised they were still available, much less new copies."
1,Badly Advertised,"I looked forward to getting this Abbot & Costello DVD with great anticipation of sharing it with my children. I especially looked forward to their ""Who's on First"" routine. I was greatly disapointed.Most of the material on the DVD comes from an early television program and was probably very funny at the time. Taking it out of that context, however, leaves it less than amusing.The greatest disappointment was the clip of ""Who's on First"". Not only did they abridge the routine, it's done as an afterthought during a cameo appearance. What you find on the internet is much better.My recommendation - if you're looking for the real Abbott & Costello, don't look here."
2,Where's the Colorization??,"Well, I've been fooled again. I bought this DVD along with Vol. 2 of A&C Funniest expecting to get COLORIZED versions of the Colgate Comedy A&C comedy routines, instead all I got was b/w versions of their bits. The bits are good, for sure, but I expected to get COLOR versions, not the b/w drab versions. I am very disappointed, I wanted these in color. I was also fooled with another Legend release supposedly releasing 3 Stooges bits in color, instead only a tiny piece was colorized and the majority of the Stooge 3 disc set that I got was in it's original b/w. WHERE'S THE COLORIZATION??? What's with the misleading advertising leading you to believe you're about to see a beautifully colorized DVD set, when instead you get literally a couple of minutes of some material colorized but 99% of the DVD is b/w. I WANTED COLORIZATION, not b/w, I've been ripped off. Who do I clobber? Oh, myself for being fooled twice."
2,whoops,"This is my first year using the Learn at Home Series. I was hoping this book would cover our full curriculum needs (with a little supplementing, of couse). It provides Lesson Plans but most subjects just give you a topic without further assistance.I have been using the Comprehensive Curriculm of Basic Skills from the same company and love it."
2,Once upon a time...,I was very disappointed with this book. I was expecting an adult book with a moving story about taking time in the present to enjoy your life. What I got was more like a young childrens book that was over simplfied.
4,What a message!,"The Precious Present has a precious message. I was surprised by the huge impact this little book had on me. Instantly, I did exactly what it said."
3,Fluffy,We used this book at work to kick off a leadership development program. Some of the participants liked the book because it made them reflect on appreciating life in the moment versus looking back or looking to far into the future. Much of the feedback was that it lacked substance and the parable was baby-ish.
3,"A riddle, a reminder, a respite","I don't want to give it away. Read the book, it will take you an hour of active reading. Anyone, everyone should read it. My eight year old read it and understood. It's good for team building, morale building, and life affirmation. Like other Spencer Johnson, Ken Blanchard, Jon Gordon, Mark Sanborn stuff, you know this, but you forget it because life sometimes separates you from living."
3,"Good Picture, poor experience.","The maual that comes with this frame is almost unreadable on a Mac, which makes it difficult to discover the features. There is no information that tells you how the frame decides on an order for your photographs. Also be aware that it does not make SD cards available to the computer over USB, so you can't use this method to load photos on your card, only the internal memory (which appears to be about 12MB.So, if you do setup your photos in 720x480 resolution they look GREAT in the frame. As I bought this for my wife to use at her office, it will serve this function well. But it won't be useful for anything else. I was hoping that with the onboard battery she would be able to carry it around and use it like a picture book, but that won't be happening. The controls are slow and basically... stupid, and there is no battery life indicator other than the one that tells you the battery is dead (it turns off... :-)).So, Photo Quality GREAT. Value POOR."
5,Great product,"I ordered this for my parents, so they can watch their first grandchild all day long :) I haven't spent a lot of time with it because I won't be keeping it, but I used it enough to load a bunch of pictures on it for them and found it to be very easy to use, with a great picture."
3,Dital picture frame,"This is a good present day capability digital frame. It has virtually no internal memory. The resolution is okay. Overall, it makes you want what you get on your computer, but hey it is far cheaper. We don't turn it on often but others see and love it when they visit."
5,Even better than I expected,"We've all seen these frames in a variety of places, so I really knew what to expect. Never the less, I was surprised by how easy it was to operate, copy photos from a memory card to the frame's memory, and to change some of the options. It's really working out of the box, which is a nice thing as I purchased this one as a gift. By the way, if you are buying this to take overseas, you will have no problem. I just had to add a European jack as the transformer is included. A good purchase."
4,Grait Gift :),"I bought this digital frame as a gift for my wife , and it was wonderful she liked it a lot , the size of the frame is very good it looks like an original frame , the resolution is perfect ,the main disadvantages of the frame are:1- it doesn't show movie/video files (for me and my wife it doesn't matter thus we just want to use it as a photo frame ).2- there is no USB input that u can directly upload to the frame ( its not a big deal because i like to use the SD cards ).3- there is no sound speaker for the frame(i already don't use the video).4- its a bit expensive comparing to the other brands that has all the features with cheaper cost .despite the disadvantages i love it , it has the best design between all of the brands , and so is the quality , with a nice touch of slide transitions , for me its worth the money spent on, with a good known brand , overall i recommend this product ."
5,Awesome frame!!!,"I bought 3 of these Philips frames in the past month for gifts. They are awesome. No trouble with any of them. I read a lot of reviews before hand which was very helpful and made my experience with the frames trouble-free. The best way (which I read from someone else) to put photos on, is to buy the $9 all-in-one card reader (USB device) which reads a variety of memory cards. This acts like a little hard drive then. Put all your photos on the card in a folder (not on the main level or root). Then insert the card into the frame and you are done! No problems at all! I did not copy any of the photos onto the frame memory, only the card, so I can edit my library whenever I want easily from my computer and dump the new library on the card.I prefer the Metal frame also, the wood frame is plastic, it looks kind of cheazy and very disappointing. They should describe to you its painted plastic, NOT wood at all! Otherwise very happy so far!"
3,Worked well for me,"This was a highly recommended picture frame that is working well so far. My roommate and his girlfriend had issues with similar versions from Philips but mine has worked like a charm thus far.However, i will say their software leaves a LOT to be desired but it works with clunky Copy/Paste."
5,Great gift!,I gave this as a gift to my husband who had requested a picture of our new daughter for his desk. Since she grows so fast and we have tons of cute pictures this allows us to see them all! It is also easy to use.
3,Works well enough...,"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Image transfers from a PC are easy enough, it shows up a USB storage device in Windows.My only real gripe is the user interface. Although I was able to change the device settings (e.g. transition mode, LCD brightness, etc.), my parents found the interface to be quite confusing since you can't actually see the buttons you'd like to press."
1,"Not a ""book"" at all","I just purchased this so called ""paperback book"". It arrived a few days ago. Is is not a ""book"" at all. It is a 10 page paper with an additional 14 pages of references. It's ""bound"" like you would submit a high school term paper, in one of those 3-clasp folders with a clear plastic cover. It took me about 15 minutes to read the entire thing. What a rip-off for $9.99 + postage, and it actually has a price sticker on the first page with a price of $23.95. If you're selling a paper, advertise it as a paper, not as a book. Very disappointed."
5,An exciting Rebel Spy!,"When Leah and Jeff end up on a blockade runner during the Civil War, they never dreamed that it could be so exciting and frightning. They end up being on the same ship as Belle Boyd, The Famous Rebel Spy! But will she come to fall for someone on the enemy side? And will Jeff and Leah be able to resolve their friendship before it's too late?"
3,corny but cute...,"Corny but cute...it was a fast read, I finished it in just a couple of days...has a couple of sex scenes but nothing too graphic...I'll be interested in see her books further down the line...she kept the story line going and it definitly has a plot...this book seemed to me to be a young adult read..."
3,Not impressed,"This book was too cheesy and superficial for my taste. There aren't a lot of vampire world things. I find it ironic that Darcy (the heroine and lady who did from the world for 4 years in an harem), wants to teach the harem ladies to be self sufficient and less superficial, yet all she sees is the superficial in the hero. All she thinks about is Adam/Austin's looks. She forgives him trying to kill ALL vampires, including a list of her friends, because he is pretty. Not only that, but the harem ladies were not al all charming or interesting. I heard that they were interesting in the first book. I was pretty turned off by the fact that the ""hero"" started snapping pictures of Darcy's body parts when he was staking out the vampire TV studio during the first few chapters. STALKER VIBE! The end of the book wasn't very impressive either, but ssshhhh.... You might still read this. Some parts were amusing, but they were fleating."
2,This is the first time ever...,"I can honestly say I don't like the ""great guy"" in this book. Adam as a leading man lacked honesty and so many of those other qualities I look for in a ""hero"". Honesty (he didn't have much on that end), great sense of humor (he seem very cynical to me) sexy (his overall attitude and lies totally washed out every other good thing there may have been about him). Sorry, as far as romances go, this one missed the mark. Take him out of the book and the author would have a great story."
2,Not as good as the first,"I was looking forward to reading this book since I enjoyed the first one so much. I found myself laughing out loud several times in How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire and was hoping Vamps and the City would be as entertaining. Sadly, that wasn't the case. I couldn't find any reason to like either hero or heroine and since I enjoy reading these books because they ARE about vampires I was also disappointed in the ending. I will read Ms Sparks third book since the first one showed so much promise."
3,Could have been better,"I read the entire book with no problem only because I am a fan of the series. The humor is great and as was the story HOWEVER Darcy really got on my nerves. I found her to be a whiner. Yeah sure, she didn't want to be a vampire, but seriously its been FOUR years! Get over it!! Maybe if she spent less time resenting her natural she would not have been so unhappy. Way to negative. She just rubbed me the wrong way with her constant boo hooing."
2,"boring, not worth reading","I loved the first book in the series, this one was just so stupid. I didn't like the woman being the vampire, and stronger than the guy (Austin). I couldn't get into the story. I could care less about a reality show, which I thought had no real part of a romantic development. The storyline was so uninteresting and ridiculous."
1,"BORING, DISAPPOINTING AND SILLY 2ND INSTALLMENT TO 'LOVE AT STAKE SERIES'","I must admit with a few other reviewers here. I loved HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE VAMPIRE...... but and a HUGE but, I trudged through VAMPS IN THE CITY and was tempted not to finish it.The plot and premise was ludicrous, boring and not even that humorous. The whole reality show The Sexiest Man on Earth, was very far fetched, ridiculous and nonsensical. Even having the women from Roman's X-harem be the judges in the contest. PLUEAZE!!!!!There was little or no chemistry between Darcy and Austin and a lot of ""Oh, how I hate that I am a vampire"" bemoaning from Darcy to Austin about her situation. It was very annoying and you wanted to just smack her at times!!!This was a very poor sequel to HTMAMV, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I hope that BE STILL MY VAMPIRE HEART redeems the series, as VAMPS IN THE CITY didn't do justice to the first installment, in my humble opinion."
3,funny sequel yet not as good as the first,"This is once again a very funny book with a light touch. It does not delve too deeply into the vampire world, so if you need a break from Christine Feehan et al, this could be the book. The dialogues are outrageously funny and the two main characters pretty well developed. Yes, some scenes seem a bit rushed, but I didn't think it made the story less believable. If you know what to expect - it is a very good book.I liked how Darcy is trying to keep her humanity and teach the harem a thing or two. She was after all, a very independent woman before her untimely change. That she falls so hard and completely for Adam, ahem Austin, just makes this story sweeter compared to the usual where the heroine hates the character at first and then develops those feelings that she knew she had inside her all along. In this book, the heroine was refreshingly intelligent.3.75 stars"
3,funny but not her best,I won't go into plot because it's in the other reviews. I will say I did not see the slight twist ending but it made sense for Darcy. Not the best in the series but you do see Gregori a lot which makes up for it.
2,A flop for a sequal,"I loved ""How to marry a millionaire vampire"" the first in the series. It was creative, sexy and im my opinion well written. This sequal follows Darcy who has been a vampire for 4 years, and Austin a secret agent who kills vampires. He is competing undercover as Sexiest man alive.I just didn't like the main characters. They were boring and ill-described. The shorty also lacked action. There was nothing really interesting going on. The author threw their ""rushed-love"" down our throat. They fell in love in a week? I know it's fiction, but come on. I also didnt like how the ending was so quick to turn darcy human. The author never really gave closure. I have high hopes for the series, so I hope I will learn more about this interesting group of people."
1,winner?,"Was this book the winner in a junior high writing contest? The winner in the ""cheesy"" catagory."
2,Disappointed,"i was rather disappointed, when i downloaded this book without reading the description, only to find out that the two main characters from the first book were not the main characters in this book. i was unaware that each book would be about some minor character from the first one. i wanted to continue to read about the first set of characters, i tend to like my books to stay on one set of people, not a whole different cast for each one. needless to say, i didnt even read it because i was so disappointed."
3,I hate to do this!!,"I was looking forward to this sequel like crazy. I absolutely loved How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire, but I'm afraid that this book didn't come close to that first book. In fact, I still haven't finished VATC. I didn't get into it right away, but hoped that I would. I never did. Something just didn't click. After thinking about it, my conclusion is that I like it when the guy is a vampire (Roman, in HTMAMV, was absolutely delicious. He is in my Hall of Fame), but when it's a vampire woman and mortal man, it doesn't work for me.The minor characters that I loved in the previous book weren't as wonderful as I remembered them.I will eventually finish this book. I will have to re-read it to finish it because I can't even remember half of it. I hope Ms. Sparks re-reads her first vamp book and gets inspired for the next. I still have hopes for Connor and Ian. (I hope they weren't killed off in this one. I didn't get that far)."
2,uhhh no,"This was the 3rd book in the series I have read and I am so glad I didn't start with this one. I probably wouldn't have continued reading the other books. I almost didn't finish this one because I didn't like the main characters and to be honest I didn't care about them that much. I got so sick of Darcy whining about being a vampire and I feel like I barely got to know Austin at all, but what I did see really turned me off. I hated how disgusted he was with her after he found ouT she was a Vampire, couldn't even look at her. I hated how she forgave him so easily for betraying her and trying to kill her entire race. Also, i found it kind of creepy at the beginning when he was taking all those pics of her from the parking lot. It was also alittle silly how fast they fell in love. They had only known eachother for a few days and had barely spoken an entire sentence to eachother. Do yourself a favor and skip this one and read Ian's, Jean Luc's or Roman's stories."
2,Hero seemed like a stalker to me.,"This book started out innocently enough, but I didn't find the hero all that likeable. He seemed like a stalker who only had lascivious ideas in mind with regards to the heroine. Likewise, I didn't understand why the heroine liked him. She knew nothing about him. Her attraction was all based on how he looked and visa versa. I put the book down after around 200 pages."
5,Sexy and Full of Fun,I have read the entire Love at Stake series and I LOVE them. I can not wait till the next one comes out. I love the characters and the emotions of the books. I found it very easy to get into and relate to the characters. I recommend this series to anyone who has an open mind and is into vamp romance with some mystery added.
1,Totally Sucked (And not literally),"I somewhat liked the first book in the series, so I had hoped that this book would have been just a tad bit better. The heroine Darcy just made me want to throw this book into the trash, she whined through the entire book. And how could she be so mad with Conner he saved her, and though she may not have been happy, the chick could have at least been grateful.I especially did not like the ending for this book and I do not give spoilers when writing reviews but, for those who have read this book you know what part in particular I am speaking of. I already know that the next book involves Angus and Emma (from the Stake-Out team) and all I want to know is why? As big as New York is are you telling me that none of the Vamps can find a normal chick who isn't out to kill them when they find out that they are Vamps. 2 book and already this series is starting to get on my nerves."
1,Tear-Jerking Trash,"Come on give us a break. How can an author touch any of us, when she is ""broke"" herself?"
1,Awkward,Good idea in theory but lousy in practice. This tool did not work for me. It is very awkward trying to hold the drill and position this gadget. I had the luxury of removing the sashes from the window jamb and working on a bench -- still impossible. Try a heat gun.
2,Save Money- - - - Pass This One Up!!!,"This company has a good idea, but the product suffers from poor materials, other than the carbide cutter. Ater a few serious uses, the cutter mangled the inner diameter of the plastic guide. Leaving an almost useless cutter on a comically long steel shaft. The guide and handle should have been made of Brass or similar, and all one piece. The guide has a tendency to slip, and spin with the shaft, so the bosses that make up the guide wear almost smooth and lose their grip anyway, since this piece is made of (not durable)plastic. As the tool is a long shaft, it is easy to get out of control and gouge the surrounding metal, or wood. I found a little care and a Carbide 1/4"" router bit used in the drill chuck more effective and less complicated. Faster too!"
1,Slow and Hard to Control,"this tool is slower than using a heat gun, and has a tendency to damage the window frame."
1,Prazi Putty Chaser,I purchased this item hoping it would work for very old windows. My wife has an art business and she sells about 200 antique windows a year. I've been cleaning out the glazing with a heat gun and chisle for years and was looking for a easier way so I thoughtI would try the putty chaser but the glazing is just to hard for the putty chasier.
3,Chips Through Dried Old Putty Like Butter,It chips through that putty like butter right out of the package. There are a few things to know though.First you need a powerful drill. It recommends a minimum of 2500 RPM. The fast the easier and cleaner the job will be for you. Second this is an acquired taste. I found that after perfecting my chisel and mallet technique I was not far behind the Putty Chaser. With the Putty Chasser you have to be careful. It has a guide but it know not the difference of wood from putty. If you have a huge house or you do this for job then give it a try. Also it's only $ so you're not going to break the bank giving it a try.
2,Product not as expected,Not well made. The bushing/mutton spacer is plastic and wears very fast. Doesnot remove glazing well and grooves wood on muttons when it does. Worn out after 1 window of 6 panes. Cannot recommend this product at 1/2 the price.
1,Just Stupid!!,"There is as far as I can tell no redeeming value to this ""tool"". Better you should use a sharp stick or a screw driver. There is a need for a tool such as this one purports to be, but this rendition is not the answer. I know what this tool is attempting to do, however it is obvious the designer has no idea how one designs tools that meet the rigorous requirements of such work. Aside from the quality issues the dam thing is downright dangerous. This tool is a total waste!!!"
3,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"Purchased the Prazi Putty Chaser to remove old window glaze. The item works, but not well. The depth adjustment does not stay in place and using a drill is awkward. After using the item a short period of time I came up with three other alternatives using a router. The router works much better and faster. I chalk it up to a $15 lesson in learning to do with what you have on-hand."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This putty chaser is junk, it does not work well at all. It is much easier and faster to remove the glazing putty from around your windows with a heat gun, much easier. I return my putty (junk) chaser back to Amazon."
1,Didn't work well,Didn't take long for this thing to break. And it didn't really work very well getting any of the old hard putty out either.
1,Before you buy Samsung...,"Before you buy a samsung TV, make sure that you google ""Samsung TV"" and ""white dots"" to see how many people are getting TV's that look great for a year and then they start getting all these white dots on the TV. I have this TV and I was happy with it until right after the year warranty ran out. These dots started appearing and now are all over the screen. It costs more than half the original cost to fix, even though samsung knows it is a defective part."
3,Good TV for 2 years and 9 months then started to have issues - Samsung fixed them though,This was a great large screen TV at a good price but at around 2 years and 9 months of normal family viewing white dots began appearing on the screen - turns out there is a problem with the projection unit that afflicts some dlp tv's - samsung service was excellent they fixed it with no quibbles.
5,great,"it arrived a little late, but on the day it was supposed to. set up was easy and the price was very good."
4,Great TV at a awsome price,I am very happy with my purchase. The price was absolutely awsome. I would say that this TV is the best value and it ranks right at the top as far as picture quality and options for expanding your home entertainment system.
5,SAMSUNG does it AGAIN!,"This amazing DLP HDTV is for someone who demands quality. It's incredibly light, but displays the most amazing images as if it were a Plasma or LCD HDTV.The 61"" display turns any room into a theater, with perfect views from any viewpoint."
3,Picture quality: Great Support: Poor,"As stated below, the quality of the output of the picture is terrific, but IF you have a problem Samsung sends a tech to your residence. BUT, if your TV needs to be replaced, God help you. The price paid for an expensive TV is high, especially when it comes to brand name support. Make sure you read reviews/posts from other brands to make a logical decision. Samsung is not what it use to be. Their too many customers and I am being treated like cattle. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been handled poorly.Good luck!"
1,DONT BUY THIS TV,"DO NOT BUY THIS T.V! Purchased the samsung dlp tv in 2008 and within two and a half years the tv began to have white dots that completely covered the tv screen and shortly after that black dots began to pop up all over the screen as well. I found that it was a samsung manufactures mistake. After calling samsung and getting the run around, they said that my tv was not one they would fix for free.Sad that a billion dollar company would not take care of their customers. They transfered me to there repair department only to find that they do not repair dlp tv's anymore!! Yes you read right, THEY DONT REPAIR TV'S THAT THEY SOLD ME A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER!I called a local tv repair service to see what could be done. It came down to me having to pay $500.00 to get it fixed! Wow, I payed over $2,000 for a tv that only worked for less than four years.Samsung DLP tv's are horrible. Dont waste your money."
1,Don't buy this TV!!!!!,"We bought this tv about 4 years ago! We bought an extended warranty. The lamp went out a month before the warranty was up, them after the warranty was up we started seeing white specs in the tv, and they became more and more until you could barely see it! We called Samsung as we had seen that it was a defect! Samsung told us that it was only a defect in SOME models and that they would only fix it in those models not ours! A few days ago, my husband was home and heard a loud pop, he came into our living room to find our TV smoking!! It had basically blown up!! Called Samsung, they informed me that since it was out of warranty, there was nothing they could do! Really?? My house could have caught on fire!! What if my dogs were home alone and there was no one to respond to the loud noise?? My house and beloved animals wouldn't be here!! I am VERY unhappy with samsung and this tv!!"
2,This television is too large.,I went from a Sony 42 inch 1080i to this Samsung 61 inch 720p. The 42 inch picture quality is much better. The 61 inch television is nice but I can clearly detect the square pixels even in high definition broadcasts. I believe the size and not the brand causes this. I wish I had not bought this television and I cannot return it since I bought it from Amazon. I will probably get used to it but my first impression is negative.While I'm at is there is no point in buying a 1080p television until broadcasts are made in 1080p. Currently there are none unless you have a $1000 Blue Ray or HD DVD player. Your 1080p television will not be any sharper than a 720p or 1080i but you will have paid a serious premium in price.
1,Not From Amazon,"This is a great TV - But do not buy it from Amazon!If ANYTHING is wrong with it, God help you because Amazon won't.Amazon needs to stick to used books."
4,Great picture for a short while,"We bought this TV last February and have enjoyed great picture quality until recently when the bulb in the picture lamp assembly blew. After waiting 5 days for a technician, we were informed that this item is not regularly carried by technicians as it is too new and that a replacement is $179.99 from Samsung and is a self installed replacement. The technician quoted that this issue may be a frequent occurance after 9 months to a year (less than 5000 hours). Hopefully, technology will improve the longevity of these bulbs in the future."
5,This TV Rocks!,"I am watching more TV than ever. The built-in HD tuner with a simple rabbit-ear antenna is the winner. ""Dancing with the stars"" on CBS is lively. I wish they had the superstation - channel 5 - as HD as well.Got a Sony HDMI and optical audio out DVD player(DVPNS75H) for $111. HDMI cable from e-Bay for $1.50 + $5.99 shipping. And I am all set.By the way, originally I got the TV for 1940, but got price matched to $1700. I am not at all scared with the prices falling. Amazon is great!Wish list-The USB should have supported the movie files instead of just stills and MP3's. Would have loved to play the DivX and VOB's etc. from USB drives.Audio could have been better. The optical audio out could have been the raw audio out (5.1 or 6.1 - whichever the DVD supports) - output to audio reciever, so that a non-optical DVD player would have been fine."
5,"Samsung HL-S6186W 61"" DLP HDTV","I was Fry's looking at the Sony KDS60A2000 and Samsung HL-S6186W. The Sony was a 1080p and cost $1300 more than the Samsung which is only 1080i. I decided to buy the Samsung based on the following.1. Currently, no cable or dish provide broadcast at 1080p. They only broadcast at 1080i. So why pay more for a for something I can't get anyways.2. When it's all said and done, I'll be saving almost $1300.3. Quality wise I can't tell the difference between the Sony and SamsungI would recommend you comparing the 2 side by side to see if the it's worth it."
2,Another of De Laurence's literary piracys. AVOID.,"This book is one of mail-order magick/literary pirate De Laurence's thefts. This is the Mathers/Crowley edition of the Goetia. Beware-- multiple editions of this this book were published over the course of 50 years, ALL indicate they are the first edition. Most are not. The $700+ price this seller is charging is ridiculous. Not even a 1st De Laurence edition of this book is worth more than $100.00, and later editions substantially less so. Much better (and more complete) editions of The Goetia have been published in the last decade, for a lot less money. Buy them, and avoid this overpriced piracy."
4,Book of evil spririts,This book os a very very old cerimonial magick book. It is very hard to come by but those interested in midevil ancient magick this is the one gor you!
3,"says youth, but big enough for a teenager","I thought this would be good for my three year old who is as big as most 5 year olds, but it seems to be more suited to a teenager or adult. I'll have to wait a few years before I give it to him."
3,arrived quick..but..,"I got the dvd in record time, but it was scratched a bit, and skipped during certain parts of the movie. Otherwise everything was good"
3,Carry On Boating,"This is a Boulting Brothers cast in a ""Carry On"" movie. It's not as bad as Leonard Maltin thinks, but it just isn't very good. Ian Carmichael, Dennis Price, Sid James, Liz Fraser, Janette Scott and the rest of the first-rate comedy actors do their best with a very lame script that depends upon tight clothes and jiggling from the women and slapstick from the men. The story is about a couple of newlyweds who buy a lame old houseboat, take it to sea, wind up in France, and then best their crooked landlord (he owns the wharf) in a bet to see who gets home first. The DVD, by the way, is first class; the film looks fresh. Now if only it were funny."
3,old school,Got this DVD and I guess I expected more because the enhancment when switching from film to DVD not the best. The jokes are still the same though and thats what they were all about.
5,AWESOME!,Bought this item twice - once for me and once for a gift. The best quality and price anywhere! Shipping was quick. Lots of laughs. I highly recommend it.
4,abbott & costello,"Bought it for the who's on first routine. That is a ""10"". The rest of the routines, on a scale of 1-10, is a 7."
4,"Abbott and Costello: Funniest Routines, Vol. 1",I highly recommend this DVD. It was a present to someone who repeatedly had talked about the Who's on First routine between Abbott and Costello. I think I made his day with this surprise. He loved every minute of it and was truly surprised and said Santa did good. Very enjoyable.
5,Lovely platter,True to the Mikasa name. Dip bowl is removable and the platter can be used on it's own. Gift for my sister-in-law. She loves it!
3,Good for low production cutting,"Ok saw. Hard to line up for vertical cuts. Also, the saw guide next to blade can get bent. Must have the extensions and wheels to make it easier to use. Good use of floor space."
2,Not too excited!,"I bought Coolpix 4300 two months after I had bought Canon Powershot S400. Reason for two? It was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid.The two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing.I've had no problem with Canon whatsoever. With Nikon, althoughpicture qualities are as good as any other 4 MP cameras, I've had the following headaches;1. Pictures won't transfer to PC directly from the camera using the included transfer cable. I did everything I could, and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to PC is with the card reader. Card reader is included.2. The speed is noticeably slower than Canon, especially so with flashes on.3. With low battery, it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip. I used Lexar 256 MB and I still use it which means nothing is wrong with Lexar. Be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries."
2,Nice Photos But Its Faults Aren't Worth It,"My family had a Nikon 4300 for a few years and we enjoyed it because of its small size and its photos weren't bad. However, we did come across some problems.1. The shutter lag was utterly annoying and I missed a lot of photo oppurtunities.2. It takes a long time to delete the photos.3. Our lens got stuck or something and the camera gave us a ""SYSTEM ERROR"" in which the lens would not get pushed in our out.4. Poor photos with low lighting (Very blurry), which includes indoors.5. Battery life pretty short. Half of its energy was gone when I had the thing on for 20 minutes and I didn't have it on the whole 20 minutes.I DID get some good photos from the camera. It's not as manual as I'd like it to be, but I recommend to get a lens protector to avoid the System Error. I tried the Canon S1 IS in Best Buy and it turned on really fast and took photos really fast indoors. Also it wasn't blurry!"
2,Forever to power on and too long between pics taken,"When you power on the Nikon 4300, it takes forever to be ready to take a picture (over 5 seconds). After you have taken one picture, you will have to wait another 5 second you can take another picture. So disappointed. -JP"
5,Damn Good Little Camera,"I've had this camera for just over a year now and I still love it. Yes, if you leave the lens cap on, it won't work until you recycle the camera. If you are smart enough to take the lens cap off first, this problem won't *BE* a problem (which I hate to admit has happened far more than once). In all fairness to some negative feedback that I've read, the camera works as well (I would say much better) than its 4 MegaPixel counterparts. Deleting a file takes a few seconds, not minutes. Delays in taking pictures has to do with utilizing the autofocus function, which you have the power to override with a manual option. My biggest complaint is that when you use the video function it does not record sound. So video is just video, unfortunately. I find this an irritant, but one I can live with. For it's robustness, it is surprisingly small and, using maximum resolution, the only flaws I've found in pictures has been due to the cameraman, not the camera. A solid ""Thumbs Up"" for me!"
3,Buy an extended warranty,"Purchased the coolpix 4300 in March of 2004 and loved it. Great photos and loved the features. In mid June, just 15 months later, the zoom and focus died. Nikon wants a check for $249.00 mailed with the camera to even look at it. A local camera repair shop wants over $200.00. Cannot believe it when the camera was only 3 months post warranty. Have replaced it with a Canon A95 from Amazon for about the same price as the repair would have been but I lost some $260.00. To say the least I bought an extended warranty. Will never buy another dig camera without one. Is that not a shame???"
5,Great Camera,"Great camera. I am impressed with how easy this camera is to use. It takes great pictures. The manual is easy to understand, and it is mostly idiot proof. It is small, unlike my Canon SLR, so it easily fits in my pocket. I have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots. Now where did I put that manual?"
3,Blurry Photos,"Everthing is great but when u turn off the flash the photos become very blurry. With flash their great, without the flash the photos are crap!! DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA. I bought it and thinking about returning it.Justin"
3,"Good pictures, loud, slow, and a bit big.","Overall: Good for the price, and the quality Nikon optics.But it is slower than I imagined - comparing it to other camers that use a different metering system with the ""red light laser"" thingy.That plastic cap - I got use to it - don't worry about that.The battery - I NEED ONE THAT LASTS LONGER!The pictures - great 4mp quality with plenty of handy scene modesThe extras - I wnat to get a wide angle lens soon."
2,The perfect Camera.....if you are a rock.,"I bought this camera with very high expectations and for the most part it has done a good job. It takes wonderful pictures even in extremely dark areas with or without a flash. It captures beautiful color and detail has a great zoom and tons of options. The problem is unless you have a tripod with you at all times it is nearly impossible to get a good picture without any blur. This is not only from my experience, but also from friends and family who have used it as well. I even set it on a level rail and set the timer to take the picture and it came out blurred. So unless you want to carry a tripod all the time I would suggest buying one of the new Kodak cameras."
3,Initial impressions,"I got a chance to play with this camera today. The picture quality seems up to Nikon's typical quality. The only thing that really lept out at me, however, was how slow the camera was. Browsing through pictures can take up to 8 seconds a pop. Deleting a picture takes, literally, minutes. I've never used such an outrageously slow digital camera in my life. It seems others have also had this problem. In addition, the lens cap is a pain, and the lens smashes into it if you forget to remove it--not good. Nikon's mid-range seems to be lacking in the digital world, but their high-end stuff cannot be beat. There are better cameras than this one in the point-and-shoot segment."
4,"good camera, but not terrific","I bought this camera one year ago and paid mid $300 for it. It did produce several nice pictures. But I'm disappointed with two facts. First of all, it's hard to get a good picture of moving subjects. Many pictures of my baby girl, when she is waving her hands or rolling over on the floor, are blurry. Second, I haven't gotten any good prints yet. All pictures look vivid on the computer but dull on the print. Maybe it's because I developed them at Sam's club. But it sucks if the only way to get good pix is to develop them at somewhere else at higher price.I have read several good reviews of this product on this website and many others. I feel either those guys are smarter than me, or they just have relatively low expectation of digital cameras. I really hope that in the future when someone writes his enthusiastic reviews of this product, he can tell us whether he has experienced my problems, and if yes, how he solves them."
4,"Disappointed at first, now focus problem solved","I have owned this camera for about 1 week and felt disappointed at first. I took well over 150 pictures, many that are very good BUT about 20 were blurry. All of the blurry ones were taken with the Scene - Party/Indoor setting on. If pictures are taken indoors with normal auto mode, the colors are not nearly as good as other cameras. It is very slow at taking and storing pictures, and as I read in another review, it does take 10 seconds to delete a picture when there is about 100 shots stored.Since my first set of pictures, I read the manual again and followed the directions. If I press halfway, wait for the focus light to appear and then take the picture, I do not have any focus problems."
4,Good book,"Teaches you how to be a great person along the way.It is good that it teaches you to change your both your insides and outsides, whereas many other books out there only teach you one aspect.Solid book. I recommended it for everyone who wants to be a better clicker."
5,How to Click with Everyone Every Time,"David has this amazing ability to make us see what we really already know, but aren't sure how to enact. This book is so smart and gives a lot of practical tips that can be implemented immediately, without therapy! :-)"
3,Excellent starter book,"This book is good for every reader, from novice right thru the advanced trainer. Point of view is unique and fun. A MUST OWN book!"
1,request,please add the size (ie 4 inches in diameter) to the description? I need that info. before I can buy...thanks!
3,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly 1975","A don't know if Willie Colon were just trying to fill a quote whit this album before leaving to go to college; but this album is not at the same level of previous productions or those that follow this one.I only buy this CD for the song ""Que Bien Te Vez"" and I have no regrets."
5,Cool shoe - great price,Cool shoe for a teen boy and great price. Great gift - what they wanted... I would recommend getting them.
2,Spiffy looking piece of junk...,"I spent hours over weeks looking for a stroller that I could use for jogging, but that didn't break the bank. I knew this was not a well known stroller, but by the specs it seemed it had everything I needed/wanted in a stroller. When I got it, It seemed OK....however,I just couldn't get past how big it was, and how cheaply made it seemed. Then, the first time I used it for more than just a walk into daycare, it started squaking SO loudly...The storage on the bottom is pretty small, the parent tray is so close to the button to fold the stroller, that it's basically useless. It had a couple of neat features, like the removeable child tray, and it does sit about vertical if wanted, but it is such a pain to get it all the way up. Pinches my finger every time, and you have to move the seat fabric. Overall...I'm definitely not happy, and will be returning it and paying the extra money fo a baby jogger or a BOB. Hope this helps."
2,"Good idea, but poor quality","nice stroller, but very cheap made. If you are looking for a stroller that will last - this isn't the one. Very disappointed."
3,Kind of overpriced,I feel that in this price range you should get large cup holders that fit. The front fork literally deformed from stressed but was sent a new 1 with free shipping.
1,Dangerous!,"I LOVED this stroller at first with the exception of the very long seat straps (too loose for even my 9 month old)and small canopy. Seemed to have everything I wanted (love the storage, child & parent trays). Great price and friendly customer service. HOWEVER it has been recalled for the front wheel falling off...and then the back wheel fell off during a 5K (thank God I was walking) I tripped and my baby almost hit the pavement. I returned it the next day. I will spend the extra $50 for a Joovy 360 which gets great reviews and will hopefully keep it's wheels on!"
1,be aware,"This stroller seems very nice at first, but it has flaws. I used it daily for 3 month. I am not doing anything crazy with it, but just today one of the wheels fell off. I was reading a review stating the same thing after I purchased and was hoping this was a one time thing, but it happened to me, too! So be careful. Look around and you might just be better off purchasing a different stroller.It also wears off fast by the connection parts, where it folds. I was just waiting for this thing to break, tell you truth... Nothing happened to my son, because I had a good grip on the stroller..."
3,Have Used Better,"I have owned this stroller for just over a year now. I bought it because my other stroller did not have a very large storage area underneath. This is a definite plus of the Urban Advantage. I also like the size of the parent cup holders in the tray. I have a few complaints, however, and would not buy this stroller again had I had a chance to test it before purchasing. It always seems to pull to the right, regardless if I have anything in it or I am pushing it empty. Additionally, as the other reviews state, it folds up very easily; however, it is very bulky when folded, and it does not lock, so it tends to open back up while I am lifting it into the back of my SUV(I am only 5'3"", so this is a challenge sometimes). The sunshade is very small, so it's not great at blocking the sun when the seat is reclined. I liked the idea of this stroller, however, I have not found it as easy to maneuver as my Chicco or BOB. I would not recommend this stroller to a friend."
4,This book in its innocense is a good look at 1 girls life,"I enjoy the book Also reccomend "" My Secret Life"" Anonymou"
3,great toy,"my son actually got this for his construction themed 2nd birthday, and the belt was too little for him, the tools are very durable, were keeping it for when he is a little older!"
1,This Book Is A Joke,"Whoever this ""Commander X"" is, he's obviously a comedian. This book is a joke. The author's argument wanders all over the place and is not coherent. The quality and resolution of pictures and documents in this book are incredibly poor. The pictures are out of focus and/or grainy, and could easily be fakes or pictures of something else besides what they are claimed to be. Anyone who believes this book will believe anything. I am NOT a UFO skeptic, I do believe they exist, but this particular book is a sham. Save your money!"
5,A creepy soundtrack!,"Body Parts is a highly unheard of movie,yet has a very good story behind it.The soundtrack is very spooky is consists of pure classical music with heavy use of a theremin that adds a perfect degree to strangeness to the film score...enjoy!"
3,Definate brain damage movie - rabbit hole ahead,"Well this movie is a real bad trip. You wont get the plot, and you probably will lose several brain cells, but its one freaked out ride. The movie actually has decent special effects paired with a dialog that consists of running puns and TV commercial sentences that will continue through out the movie. There will be scenes of bad animated (vga quality) nudity, a fair amount of topless and bodypainted women, as well as several full frontal male nudes. This movie is about (at best guess) secret viral experiments and gun toting hoods who go around killing for drug scores. There are several graphic sex scenes and lots of bodies. Not a movie for the kiddies. But so bizarre that its almost worth watching, if you can take it."
1,Wouldn't Work With My Receiver,"This system has a nut welded on to a U-Shaped ""lock nut carriage."" The way it's welded on makes it a bit tricky to thread the bolt into the nut, but doable. However, when I insert it into my rack from North Shore, the fit is tight enough that the open ends of the Lock Nut Carriage gets squeezed together a bit. This means that when you're trying to thread the bolt in, it's at a slightly off angle. Over and over, we could almost get the threads to catch, but then it would pop back out. Really frustrating. Bought a second one assuming that the first was just odd somehow and had the exact same problem. Maybe we just got a bad batch or maybe we're just idiots, but it kind of killed our big mountain bike trip so we're switching to a QuietRide from SoftRide. We'll see how that one works. I actually think the design of the TriMax is really slick and I assume it must be working on other receivers, but it didn't happen to work in mine."
4,"Good value, works well.","Holds tight over long trips. Supplied wrench should only be used for emergencies, plan on using a real wrench. Sometimes key/lock can be a little finicky, and bolt area is a little small so somewhat prone to slipping, but does the job as advertised and is great value."
4,Works as advertised,"We bought this to solve movement of our bike rack. I have used it once for a short trip. It took me about 20 minutes to install. Getting the internal sleeve into the correct position takes some trial and error. I could probably do it in 15 minutes now, but I would definitely budget time to install it. Not great for a quick trip to the park. You really need a ratchet set to tighten the system up. The provided tool will tighten the unit, but not enough to keep it from moving I was able to create a solid connection with a ratchet. I do not leave this installed as some others do. I recall that some reviews mentioned corrosion which concerns me and others mention loosening on long trips. I would consider using a locking washer for a long trip, but would still check it at every stop."
1,Not long enough!!,Won't go all the way through on my Toyota Tundra stock trailer hitch (class 5). Useless. Would get 5 stars if it was long enough. Be sure to measure
2,What is the lengh of the bars?,"The only reason why I am NOT buying this product, is because the description doesn't give the lengh. How stupid...!!!I am sure I am not the only one to turn this great product down. Come on, think a little and tell us how long it is."
4,correction,"Dear editors: please add the following to the review of the HD2950 that i submitted just a couple of hours ago:I called Rousseau's toll free number and they are sending me new wheels free of charge. Their customer service was friendly, prompt, and intelligent... perfect.This brings the stand up to 4 or 4.5 stars in my opinion... to make it up to 5 they would need to make it easier to work with while folded up -- as another reviewer said, the attachments for the T-stands stick out a lot and there's no easy place to stow the T's themselves. But in actual use I love this stand and it's always worth the setup time to use it rather than going back to repetitive measured cutoffs with a skilsaw."
3,out feeds break,Overall the stand is good except that the outfeed on one side snapped within two weeks of using the stand
3,Good summer beach song,Friends heard this in PNG in July and have talked about it ever since. I first heard it in Fiji where they play it every hour on the radio. It will remind me of my holiday in Fiji
1,Worst purchase ever!,This projector stopped working after one month. And I can not get warranty for it.
1,el origen perdido: no se moleste en buscarlo,"compre este libro por curiosidad, ya que el tema parecia interesante.. y tal vez lo sea, pero de alli no pasa.la historia esta sencillamente mal contada, extendiendose sin necesidad en situaciones poco interesantes. aun ignorando las mal hechas citas 'tecnicas' (a la autora, por favor asesorese mejor o no escriba sobre cosas que no conoce!!), posiblemente lo que mas me molesto de este libro fue la forma como la historia es previsiblemente 'rematada' al final, dejandola descaradamente abierta con el fin de escribir mas libros sobre el mismo tema. por favor, no mas 'caballo de troya'!!!! si quisiera tener una coleccion de libros, me compro una enciclopedia!!"
2,Still requires 2 people,Title of product misleading. You still need 2 people to bleed with this kit. How else are you supposed to pump the brake fluid out AND loosen and tighten the needle? Save your money for an actual one person PUMP.
3,Typical air box replacement. Not ALL that quality.,Rusted up very quickly.... probably within a week or 2. A couple months later nearly all the chrome was gone.Didn't hinder its operation.It attaches to the car via the base. there is no way to stabilize the filter. It simply crimps on with a hose clamp and wobbles all over the place.. contacting your carb linkage and choke. Will fail rather quickly I'm afraid.Not made for the outdoorsy aspect of a VW engine bay.. and not solid enough to take a good shaking.
1,Not what I was looking for,This is not the in-depth study I was looking for. I wanted more insight into Isaiah 16-19 but couldn't get much with this.
2,Not what I wanted,"Not organized the way I prefer. A good book, but I prefer a Barclay type commentary."
4,Don't be fooled by the reviews of others.. this CD is great!,This CD has different songs for different genres. Plus it's good if you want to hear some of the earliest songs from the GooGoo Dolls. I also like the song Everything Remains The Same by Junk Monkeys which I can only find on this CD.
1,Warning,"Although it is listed under Brian May, please note it's NOT the actual Brian May of Queen fame, but rather an Australian composer who died a few years ago."
4,HEM has an official site and store...cheaper than retail!,"I'm not sure what the reasoning behind the $73 price tag on this FORMERLY rare EP is but...Go to the HEM official website (google is your friend) and click 'store'. There, I'm Talking With My Mouth - the actual EP - is $8.00Best part is that you are buying it through HEM's own label so they get nearly if not actually all of your money.Just thought you might want to know."
5,Product Details,"Cover : The Girls Of Kiss Sex & Music IssuePlaymate : Alexandria KarlsenInterview : Drew Carey20 Questions : Gerry AdamsPictorials : Girl's Of Kiss, She'll Take RomancePublication Date: March 1999"
2,movie dvd,based on description I thought one of the stars of the movie would have a major roll but it was only a cameo appearance so I gave it away
4,4 stars for leaving ''lumpy gravy'' alone,"remixing ''we're only in it for the money'' is the worst thing that zappa ever did. good thing they reissued the original album, and it's good that it has the original sgt. pepper cover, and it's good that they left ''lumpy gravy'' alone, but for some reason lumpy gravy has a really low volume, even if you play it really high on any stereo, i've heard the reissued version, it sounds louder and cleaner,but ''money'' sounds really pixelated and 80'swith the new drums (drum machines?), bass, and the extraacoustic guitar. geez. 1 star to the remix.(it's good to here the unedited material)4 stars to lumpy gravy for leaving it somewhat alone."
4,Lots of fun,"This is a great satire. Amazingly, some of Zappa's best music is buried underneath all of the nonsense that is on this album. Funny, abrasive, intelligent-it is Zappa at his most accessible."
5,A true classic!,"Hey, I am here to say this is one great album. If you are in anyway interested in getting into Zappa's music this is a good place to start. What can I say, pure genius. And I usually get mad when people say that about anyone, but its true here!Ok one reason I want to do this review is to say to other Zappa fans if they like this they will really like a newer band called Ween, check out God Ween Satan or The Mollusk or anything by them. I'm 18 and I love Frank Zappa and I think Ween carry on where he left off, in the best way that they are completely original and equally strange. So buy this and check Ween out. Or just buy this!"
4,Classic Cover Art - Must Be Seen!,"While I enjoy the vintage Zappa music, this CD is also a ""must see"" package for the way it lampoons the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album. Every picture is a variation of a picture from Sgt. Pepper. Hilarious!!"
3,Zappa's most overrated album,"WOITFTM is almost universally praised as Zappa's best album, but to my relatively young ears it hasn't dated well at all. Critics routinely cream themselves over its potshots at the Flower Power generation, which unfortunately have lost much of their satirical bite in the ensuing thirty years. The CD reissue also boasts tinny sound quality, the worst of any of Zappa's albums. By no means is it a bad album, but it pales in comparison to ""Absolutely Free"" and ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh,"" two of Zappa's genuine masterpieces."
4,"good cd, but sound is just of the era","I always wanted and wished that frank would have rerecorded this cd with any of his later lineups, just live, and see what would have happened. Don't get me wrong the cd is great, it is just that the recording methods back then were so poor, and frank was using every inch of the tech back then. I just wished this was recorded later and talk about a masterpiece."
5,what,What's the deal with this s.h. guy? He completely copied the review for Money from the AMG musick guide? THIS WAS THE KIND OF PHONEYNESS REPRESENTED ON THE ALBUM
3,"Over-rated, but that's not Bad","Well, reading reviews on Amazon is kind of pointless considering that people give every record five stars, but here's my take on WOIIFTM. I think the songwriting is good, and there are brilliant moments on it, but come on... this is not one of FZ's better works. It's very immature, and is a dated slap at the psychadelic movement. I guess that's just me. I guess everyone that is a mild FZ fan should own this record, and it's important one in his catalog. So what am I saying? Yes, buy this record, but it's not that good. Don't expect to have your mind blown by virtuoso instrumentation, but WOIIFTM is catchy and fun. Purple monkey dishwasher."
2,Start Cryin' Zappa Fans: This Is NOT VERY GOOD.....,"Yes the Zappa-heads will be whining loudly after they read this: WOIIFTM is the most overrated disc in FZ's catalog. The real masterpiece of this era??? Absolutely Free. AF has better songs, and the studio tricks are incorporated smoothly into the music. The tunes on WOIIFTM wear thin after about 2 listenings (I mean c'mon; how many times can you listen to ""Bow Tie Daddy"" or ""Flower Punk"" once you know the joke????). If you want ""weird"", go to Lumpy Gravy or Uncle Meat. If you must have this though, stay away from the Rykodisc versions with the ""new"" drum and bass tracks, they are horrible. Let the whining begin!!!!"
1,I just don't get this.,This is unlistenable. I could only get half way through before giving up. Too clever for me.
1,Run of the mill weirdness,"A lot of people are seemingly impressed by weirdness and the social commentary. I can appreciate the weirdness, there are a lot of us who have a very off the wall absurd sense of humour. Zappa is far from unique in this; perhaps a lot of the boring types fail to understand this because they're not that type. I'll take some of the more inventive prog acts from then over this, this is overrated just like Zappa thought the Beatles were overrated. And the music is weirdness packaged as music. It's not clever or interesting. Supersister, the Dutch prog band did it better. I suppose that makes me one of those hippies or perhaps the establishment that the pompous Zappa raved about himself. His own biographer Barry Miles outs him as a pretentious control freak. Whatever, keep the myth alive."
4,were only in it for the money,"i bought this album back in the sixties,the CD quality is much better then the vinyl.Zappa is not for everybody,but he does have a following that spands for decades."
3,Whats wrong here?,"This was my first Zappa album growing up. It is still one of my favorites, and should be 5 stars. I took 2 stars away because of the way they just chop the ends of the songs off. I played the hell out of this album and know all the little snorts and pootz by heart, and they are missing. Its not just this album either, it seems to be all the old Mothers stuff is like this. If they were to fix this situation, I would trash my current copies, in favor of the ""restored"" copies. If you are new to Zappa, this is a great album, but its sound properties need to be reworked. You would be better off with a good vinyl copy though."
3,Why screw up a good thing...?,"There are enough pristeen vinyl (hell, even tape and 8-track) versions of the original version of this still floating around out there, there was no need for Zappa to rerecord all the drum/bass and consequently ruin the sound of the entire album. I'm sticking with my beat-up vinyl copy on Verve. The only thing this version gets you is the verse of ""Mother People"" which was backwarded on the original mix (I can't quote it here, or amazon won't post this review), but given the studied profanity of much of Zappa's later work, it amounts to about a third of a stale dog biscuit. Go find an original. You'll be much happier.I'll also mention that Ryko's stingy decision to turn the old two-ger CD (WOIIFTM paired with Lumpy Gravy, the Cheng to its Ang) into two separate CDs. Shameless exploitation of consumers, none of whom can say they weren't warned. Zappa (not to mention the worms) is probably tickled pink down below the ground-o."
3,Disappointed,"First, I love Nonni's..I buy the chocolate and plain ones all the time, but never saw the Limone. The order arrived and I noticed a somewhat musty smell on opening and then noticed the expiration date on the boxes is just 8 weeks off. The biscotti in the store are much fresher. Also found one box with a wierd mound of dried glue on the box with dirt and hair imbedded in the glue. I managed to forget the above and enjoy the biscotti...I tossed the box with glue mound. At least I hope it was glue."
5,Delicious Gift Basket Addition,"I used these to add to a Christmas Gift Baskets, filled with Special Cocoa Mix, Spiced Tea Mix, Fancy Jam Spread, and three or four Scones, for family and friends....and unexpected company. Everyone loved them, and I had a package or two left for myself....and they are delicious. They are such a good value for the money, and an exciting addition for these gift baskets.."
5,"Great biscotti, but had better price...","I've just bought this biscotti at Walmart for $2.88 an 8-pack. Wonderful flavor! Chocolate flavor, with more chocolate on the bottom, deliciously crisp, and has a nice almond flavor, too.However, if you buy 12 pack at Walmart it comes to $34.56, so the price here is not that great. I just don't like when they put a price here, then cross it and make you believe there's a deal you are getting."
4,YUMMY,Good cookies; but too expensive now. I used to buy them a couple of years ago and they were $10 less. I think they're too expensive now.
3,Too expensive,"I thought I was receiving 8 packs of eight instead of 6 packs of eight, therefore, I paid way too much for this product."
5,Just right,"This is a delicately flavored, not too sweet treat. Just the right thing for that mid morning coffe break and indivdully packaged for convenient transportation to work."
2,Could be better.,"The nuts are too hard for my teeth. Also, delivery was made by UPS, which must have put the items on their truck in the morning but didn't deliver until 7 o'clock that evening. By then, in the Florida heat, the chocolate coating had melted and stuck to the wrappers. Would not order by mail again."
4,biscotti from Amazon,"Good flavor and texture. Individual wrapped, stays fresh for 3 or more months. Flavor chocolate with pecan over cookie base. Wonderful with cookie or tea."
5,Wrong Color,The item itself is great. The only problem I encountered is that the mouse is supposed to be white and it is silver-gray not white.
5,A must-have CD for any jazz collection,"Jazz flutists don't often get much recognition, but in her new CD, Lori Bell proves why they should. Her clear, clean tone and lyrical, imaginative improvisations highlight this collection of original tunes and standards. She is -- bar none -- the finest jazz flutist recording today, and this latest offering is sure to please both serious jazz fans and casual listeners alike. Her take on Coltrane's 'Equinox' and her signature composition 'A Heart is but a Flower' highlight the mix. It's the perfect accompaniment to a sunny summer afternoon (or to the cool winter evening when you wish it was a sunny summer afternoon!)Enjoy........"
5,Heavenly!,"The scent of Coco Mademoiselle is just pure heaven! The perfume is very expensive, so i buy the lotion for about half the price and i still get the same scent. The scent lasts all day...i can still smell it on my clothes at night when i undress. I get compliments everytime i wear it!"
4,Perfectly serviceable map of Iraq,"Bought this to be able to follow news reports. It has towns, cities, roads, railways, political divisions, contour lines and color coding, oilfields (though not very detailed).Does not have: ethnic divisions, former no fly zones, any indication of how important the port of Umm Qasr is (other than the hint that the railway line terminates there.)Net: good choice for following events in Iraq. Probably also useful if you are going there on a driving tour (are you crazy?)"
2,More for women than for men.....,"If you're a man and you'd like some perspective on why you work as much as you do----don't buy this book. The author admits that 85% of her clients are women, so perhaps the information is helpful if you are female. But for me (a man) it missed the mark as to why men work so much and what we can do to work less and feel like adequate providers (or just keep our jobs, for that matter!!)."
4,good compact reference,"this book is fairly complete, for a small paperback. i use it as my reference for mulching, planting, pests, etc. it has profiles of the common vegetables listing: soil, location(sun, drainage, etc), fertilizer, soil type, depth of planting, width apart in rows, width of rows, how much seed, planting instructions, watering, date of planting, succession planting, types, harvesting, storage, yield, and notes. also covers, starting seeds, composting, insecticide alternatives, and general organic info. certainly not a 1 book library, but the simple comprehensive info n the veggies is valuable to me."
2,"Bad design ,no controle and flimzy",".You need 2 people to fly this brick. One to run as fast as they can into the wind and through it up and one to hold the controler and try to fly. If you are not flying with a 2200 Mhmp,11.1 LyPo for get it. She will pull hard left at lift off. If you make it up, get way up because she is a fast flyer, No low speed passes. Everone I know how has one, has crashed it! If you bought the E-flight P-38 ($199.99) you know what you are getting a great looking plane that needs to sit on the ground. When it does crash look for a total rebuild everything is flimzy. Buy super cube and have fun !!"
4,"A useful, biographical source","McL.Cote offers an in-depth account of the lives of Charles Stewart Parnell's family, focusing on his mother's heritage, her life and that of his sisters. Of special interest are McL.Cote's account of the workings of Famine relief in the US and the role Fanny and Anna played in collecting and distributing funds. These activist sisters contributed significantly to Irish Famine relief, and Anna continued in her role as a national activist during the rent evictions that followed. Added to the biographical narrative are selections of poetry written by the sisters. Although sometimes tedious in detail, the book offers readers interested in 19th century Ireland an important history."
5,Excellent,I received the product I ordered quickly and it was in perfect condition. I would use this seller again!
5,Exceptional piece of work!,"Amanda Sloat is a keen observer and a fine writer. Her description of the development of Scotland's constitution was both informative and incisive. The book has an obvious market in university libraries, but I should think that anyone interested in Scottish history would want to own this book. Though Sloat is a scholar, her book has the appealing quality of being accessible. I recommend it."
5,Love these beautiful cabinet knobs,"I have these knobs on all the cabinets in my house. I recently purchased more for a second bathroom. They are very pretty and hold up well. They add a decorative touch to any room. However, one must purchase metric bolts to fasten them to drawers and doors as the ones provided are too short."
4,"A Bear to Install, Ties up Saw. But it Works Great.","Initially I purchased model PR2700, but it would not fit my Bosch CS5. I. returned it for a PR7000 to install on a worm drive Skil HSD77. It would not fit so I called the factory who advised the blade guard must be removed, a tricky 3 hour process I had to figure out myself.It was as a hassle to install and my expensive worm drive saw is tied up as it takes too long to remount the blade guard. The chips are dropped up on top of the cut which blocks the line as you cut so a vacuum or blower line to move them makes life a lot easier.The attachment does work great. However, in order to get clean square cuts, much as it is using a regular circular saw, the plate must be square to the blade, the saw cannot be forced faster than the saw can remove chips and the blade has to be sharp and lubricated. I use it on anything over 3x4 lumber, landscape timbers and fence posts."
3,Australian-made circumcised version,"Just acquired, an Australian-produced DVD presents two forty minute stories of the Universe beginnings and alien existence possible, a far cry from a product from Amazon.Visually attractive, New York City lovely depicting, in such context work is hardly educative too much at all."
3,Brain or not to be brain,It is a good video but it is nothing more than one person's opinion about how human brain works. The presenter's about human spirtuality were less developed and he was trying to understand everything from physical point of view which is not always correct.
2,A COSMOS copy?,"Maybe I was spoiled by Sagan's COSMOS that was produced 30 years ago, but this video really didn't impress me. I found the host somewhat distracting and a little bit of a ham in the way he presented things. As for the content, very little of it is anything new. Like one other reviewer said, a lot was missing from this video (and I haven't even read the book). They could have used some of the time they ""wasted"" on the anecdotal details of discovery to include more material. Most of the stuff in the video are things that we've known for a long time, with one or two newish ideas. I would recommend watching this if you can catch it on TV, and maybe as a purchase if you can get it for just a few $$."
2,Lackluster and sometimes inaccurate,"NOVA isn't what it used to be. The BBC Series ""The Planets"" contains much of the same subject matter, presented more accurately with interviews of more relevant people."
3,"Hello, Rykodisc...?","This is a great album, but the Rykodisc reissues that originally came with a white card with personnel information, etc., now only have the regular CD inserts. The information found on the white slips is not to be found. This unfortunately tends to happen with nice reissues - overslips, for example, or ""obis"", tend to disappear with later pressings. In this case, it's quite an insult to the musicians."
2,Broken Jewel Case,"On the one hand, this vendor had the somewhat hard-to-find CD and shipped it promptly.On the other, it was simply put in a padded envelope so, predictably, it arrived with a broken jewel case. I assume that is Amazon's fault not that of Overstock, but I don't know with certainty.Hard to accept when you pay $40 for a CD.This has happend to me many times with CDs shipped by Amazon."
3,I Beg To Differ,"Whoever wrote the editorial review for this album REALLY needs to get their facts straight. Imagine was written and recorded in England well before the Lennons moved into the Dakota in NYC, so John could not have been sitting at his white piano inside the Dakota looking out over Central Park and composing Imagine. Nice thought, though.As far as the album goes, it's bearable. When I try to take the vocals out of the mix and listen to John and Ringo (and Klaus Voorman) laying down the groove musically, I can appreciate it. I mean, after all, you have half the Beatles playing together on record!"
1,"A Joke, but not a funny one","Let's be honest: Yoko cannot sing, not even a little. Her voice can be compared to fingernails on a chalkboard. Her navel-gazing poetry is just as bad as her vocals. Am I bitter that this no-talent woman broke up the Beatles? You bet.I will give this to Yoko: she was a driving force to the re-civilization of Central Park, and for that I am grateful."
4,VERY Underated.,"Don't write this off as another one of ""those"" albums. This is a really great album. There is very minimal shrieking and the lyrics are very heartfelt. It's painful to listen to at times because Yoko conveys the universal emotions that everyone feels after a serious loss so well in all of her songs. Rather than trivializing John's death by screaming and shrieking about it (this is not Plastic Ono Band 2), she managed to pull herself together and make a really great record. Minus one star because her voice begins to grate after awhile and not all the songs are winners, but as a whole this is pretty damn good. And the cover photo is worth the price of the whole album by itself. Pretty powerful stuff."
1,Disgraceful,"The album cover, the gun shots on the record, the disco single, the survival themes, etc.--All done to sell the record and advance Yoko's position, myth, status, and legend. Pathetic and disgraceful. This is not an artist experiencing a great catharsis after a trauma but a conniving, shrewd, calculating, stone-cold business person who is a master of media and image manipulation. If you enjoy pretentious, corny music produced by top notch studio cats forced to make something out of nothing, go ahead and buy this. If you want music with heart, soul, pain, loss, emotion, grief, triumphant and catharsis go listen to some George Jones records from the early 80s. I can't appreciate ""art"" when someone's recording and marketing budget hovers in the millions."
1,"time travel, cancel trip!","Oh dear, initial premise good, 1800's school marm reads 17th century pirate tale and ends up on pirates ship. I do not have enough English Major in me to figure out what exactly is wrong with this book, but it read as very flat, almost like reading a play and trying to inject emotion from the page into a character, very exhausting and ultimately not worth the effort."
4,An Insightful Critique,"Marcuse offers a brilliant critique of advanced industrial society that fuses dialectical thought, Freudian theory, Marxist perspectives, and even a bit of existentialism here and there. It provides a comprehensive critique of our technocratic social order, as it has become, that is reminiscient of the works of later French poststructuralists, like Deleuze and Foucault. Ultimately, Marcuse founders on the contradiction between short-term and long-term interests, explicitly critiquing the Welfare State while implicitly, it could be argued, advocating it. However, ""One-Dimensional Man"" is the best basis for critique yet, with much of the insight that later emerged in the French intellectual fast track, but without the ambiguity of poststructuralist alternatives. Marcuse is both entertaining and brilliant, a must-read for specialists, and an eye-opening classic for the general educated public."
2,I got a dud,"I ordered two of these (one for headphones, the other for my car). One of them worked perfectly, the other was defective. The bad one was NOT in stereo, and it wasn't even really mono, because only one channel came through and it sounded distorted.However, the seller (BargainCell) really came through and sent me a replacement on the spot."
3,I own It,"This item serves it purpose to plug into the phone any standard headset. The only problem I encountered was that after about 4 months, the plastic housing that surrounds the phone side plug separated, causing me to enlist tape to hold things together."
1,Poor Quality,"I had it in my pocket(for two hours at work-sitting at my desk)... with nothing else in my pocket mind you, but the female end has seemed to start to come off and detach itself from the main wire. so if you buy this product, dont bend it whatsoever. im lucky i could tape it back together but its not worth the shipping charges to get it to you."
2,Badly made! Waste of shipping fees.,Broke the second day at blackjack connection end. Very delicate and lost sound on one channel.
5,Worth the price,"I've had this product for 2 weeks now, and I've had no problems with it. I use it with my Samsung Sync (A707) and have not experienced the popping noise that other people have experienced. I leave mine in my car so it doesn't travel, as others have had the casing come apart. I think it is well worth the price to turn my phone into a iPod."
2,"Wow! Horrible Sound, It truly proves the saying ""you get what you pay for""","I have a Javo adapter but it broke so i thought that i would try this one since it was cheaper. The sound is horrible! it sounds like mp3's are ripped at 16kbps. It's a very hollow sound, and not a lot of bass. I have no idea why sound quality would be different across these adapters but I use the same earphones, and there is definitely noticeable. Luckily I'm still covered under the Javo warranty so they are sending another one out to me for free."
2,bad product,"the thing kept breaking on me after a week or so, then it completely stopped working shortly after. Thats what happens when you try to save a few bucks."
3,"Works but makes popping ""crack"" sound between songs.","I can't remember who marketed this or made it either (most likely in China or Asia, which goes without a doubt), as I bought it in January 2007. It works, just with that one exception of making those very loud pops between songs. I can't relax and listen to a lot of songs, drifting off to sleep or such, because everytime that pop happens, it jars me awake. At work, it isn't a bad idea to keep me alert."
1,This fell apart before I used it...,Don't waste your money on this product. I have tried 2 different brands of this adapter and both fell apart withing the first use.
2,Popping noise annoying,"Probably not as much to do with this product as with the Blackjack, but the popping sound between songs, when the audio is turned on/off, is very annoying. I suspect there can be a solution by adding some sort of noise filtering on the adapter.It can be mitigated by using faders (so the audio does not go on/off), but it is still persistent, and the fader solution requires a 3rd party product (like PocketPlayer).I used two different adapters (I purchased two, one for my phone and one for another Samsung) -- it does not seem to be a problem on the other Samsung model (A707).I'll be using a bluetooth wireless earphones from here on out."
1,Big Design Flaw & Slow Service,"This seemed like a bargain, extended delivery delay notwithstanding. However, the sound is awful. I ordered two, and both produce tinny sound and loud, unbearable clicking noises. And one literally cracked and fell apart after one use. The price was great, but ultimately a rip-off for the delivered product.I got one from Cingular (at a higher price), and the sound is perfect. It saved me from having to buy a new mp3 player. With a 2G microSD card and the headset adapter to accommodate my regular headphones, presto!, no need for an iPod.Just buy it from somewhere else!"
2,Pops Crackles and Fragile,If you can look past the occasional well actually frequent pops and crackle noises and the fact that the item is very fragile it is a great product. I had to pull out some tape to provide it with some extra reinforcement after having the item for 2 days...but in all fairness it does accomplish the goal of being an adapter adequately.
2,"Very Cheap quality, connector cracked open very next day","The product is of the same quality which you pay for. I had ordered two items together and when i received the shipment, this product was missing.After calling amazon and bargain cell for few time, i got the item shippedand whe i started using it, the connector shell opened up very next day itself.I would suggest dont go for it, not even worth the shipping :(two stars from me for it."
1,"Crap, Crap, Crap...",This device has the durability and quality of a preschool construction project as it broke within the first 3 minutes...no joke. Much better off just getting the Samsung headphones which are made specifically for the Blackjack. They actually work very well.
2,"Works as stated, except for one major flaw","I bought two of these headset adaptors for my blackjack to listen to music. When I pluged my headphones into the adaptor, I found that when a song changed in media player a loud click sound would play. I also heard the sound when using other applications on the phone. The loud ""click"" sound happened between every song and was very distruptive and probably bad for my ear drums.Just a warning. Please leave comments if you found a way to fix this flaw."
4,Survival Guide to Signing,This is a good book to keep in your car or purse (briefcase) to do a quick look-up of a word although it is limited on how many signs it carries it's still a good book. I would like a index in the back cause when you learn more of the world of signing you will find out that one sign could mean more than the word your looking for with the same sign and might be listed under another word.
3,An interesting score for a horror film,"Don't expect anything in the same line of the three strong and classic Jerry Goldsmith's scores, this is a surprisingly ""light"" score to an horror film. In fact lots of the ""horror"" scenes in the movie uses music from ""The Omen"" and ""The Final Conflict"" (not included in this CD) and the only track that, very vaguely, reminds the style of the score to the other films is ""Jo's Death"", but even in that track the tone is much lighter.This music reminds me more of a ""looney tunes"" cartoon (even with some ""circus"" music), with a kind of ""mickey mousing"" quality, following closely every small action in the screen. Even if it does not seem like an horror score, in the movie it does function to enhance the suspense portions in a very different way that I find interesting.My favourite tracks are ""Felicity"", ""Psychic Fair"", ""Karen's Baby"" and the finale. Not for all tastes, but if you like the sound samples you will enjoy this album."
1,"An annoying read; stick with ""Crocodile on the Sandbank""","There is absolutely no point for the introduction of Ramses; if Peabody doesn't like kids then she shouldn't have one--it's as simple as that. I hate how they don't seem to care whatsoever about the kid; he's just ignored and forgotten through most of the tale. Also, the whole romance triangle between Mary--Arthur--Karl--O'Connell was just ridiculous and irrelevant, especially considering how out of the blue the ending was.Crocodile on the Sandbank (Amelia Peabody, Book 1)was much better."
2,What a disappointment!,"As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series. I was deeply disappointed. First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking. (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.) Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting. I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me."
1,A Waste of Time,"Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially ""catty"" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian ""archaeology"" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it."
1,Don't Bother,"Tedious and inane come to mind. It is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a ""catty"" pseudo-feminist style, rambling descriptions of Egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the ""ignorant natives"" of Egypt and inept sexual innuendo. The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real. Very disappointing. Leave this one on the library shelf."
4,Picks Up Where the First Book left off,"Elizabeth Peters has done it again. The second book in the Amelia Peabody series is just as tongue-in-cheek funny as the first. Her narratives of location make the locations come to life for the reader. The mystery is amusing, as most of Elizabeth Peters murders are. They are taken seriously, yet the characters are not. I say that because of the characters' reactions to murders and mummies in the book. This series of books is great fun to read."
4,Better than the First One,"I just started on the Amelia Peabody books. Crocodile on the Sandbank I thought a little stilted and the writing a little dull, even though I loved the characters. The plot is lightweight but still entertaining. But I really thought this book was much much better: the writing was crisper, funnier, snappier. I find the relationship between Peabody and Emerson an updated version of Jane Eyre and Rochester--or the wonderful couple from Bronte's Villette. If you don't like that kind of interaction you won't like this. As a feminist I find nothing insulting or backwards about this portrayal. It is ironic and hilarious. The mystery is fully enjoyable."
3,Light but confusing!,"This second novel of the Amelia Peabody series is unfortunately not quite as enjoyable as the first one.The setting is still the 19th century Egyptian archeological milieu and there is still a good dose of humour throughout the book, but the convoluted plot is hard to follow and of course totally unrealistic. Secondary characters are rather stereotypical and one-dimensional: an Irish journalist, an American millionaire, a French nun, a German archaeologist, etc.More care could have been taken in editing. Some elements, though amusing at first, become tediously repetitive. Such is the use of the window to enter their bedroom by the main characters. Also, specific expressions such as `time is of the essence' are repeated two or three times in a few pages for no plausible reason.Someone looking for light entertainment with a touch of information on Antiquity will however consider this book worthwhile."
3,A Bit Melodramatic,"This story about the pharaohs' curse is somewhat melodramatic, but Elizabeth Peters is a good writer, and that saves it from falling into a maudlin heap to my mind. I found the story a bit tedious in spots, and the mystery was fairly easy to figure out, but there was enough to keep me reading until the end in spite of that. I stil think the series gives a good look at Egyptology in the Victorian era, and Amelia, although caustic, is still quite funny. I will read more in the series hoping that they will get back to being as good as the first book was."
5,collectable,"Although not as pristine as therest of my collection, I am very happy with the purchase as it has become so rare!"
3,Huge undertaking,"Since this hasn't been released, just announced, this obviously isn't a review. But considering the massive scope of this project, and much of the material included, it stands to reason this could be the shining star of WWE DVD's. The first match I ever saw, the match that got me into wrestling and that I havent seen since 1975 but can still picture is on here. Terry Funk winning the NWA belt from Jack Brisco. Hope it's good!"
5,The Next In Line,This Is The Next In Line Of The History Of Title DVDs. It Will Be A Retrospective Supposedly Going Back To The Lineage In The NWA/WCW. That Is An Exciting Deal.
4,World heavyweight championship-7 years in the making,(2 out of 3 Falls)Pat O'Connor vs. Buddy RogersGene Kiniski vs. Dory Funk Jr.Jack Brisco vs. Terry FunkHarley Race vs. Dusty RhodesRic Flair vs. Magnum TARic Flair vs. StingDisc 2Ric Flair vs. Scott SteinerLex Luger vs. Barry WindhamVader vs. Ron SimmonsVader vs. Ricky Steamboat(Steel Cage Match)Hulk Hogan vs. Ric FlairSting vs. Hollywood HoganHollywood Hogan vs. GoldbergJeff Jarrett vs. Booker TThe Rock vs. Chris JerichoDisc 3Triple H vs. Rob Van DamTriple H vs. Shawn MichaelsKurt Angle vs. The UndertakerRey Mysterio vs. Randy OrtonBatista vs. Undertaker vs. EdgeJohn Cena vs. Chris Jericho(Ladder Match)Jeff Hardy vs. Edge
2,Third time is not a charm,"This is the third set of ""History of the title"" dvds. But although the cover is cool the dvd is less than epic.The documentary on the history of the world title is more like a history of wrestling which isn't bad to watch honestly, but the world championship is more talked about in the last 10 minutes of the documentary.The match selection was also not the best. It does have a couple of great matches that some people may have forgotten along the way. Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle at No Way Out (which they were actually trying to get for Wrestlemania 22) was great and John Cena vs. Chris Jericho at Survivor Series 2008, a few good matches, but not enough to get the dvd. The rest of the matches are random and forgettable."
3,I don't know...,"...but the video preview here on Amazon doesn't give me much confidence for it'a accuracy. They say that the card at Comiskey Park had an attendance record that stood until 1987 with Wrestlemania III, however I can confirm that the WCCW David Von Erich Parade of Champions in 1984 and the 1986 Big Event in Toronto drew more prior to Wrestlemania. So it's hard to have confidence on this documentary when they can't even get the facts straight."
1,You want a blade with that? It is NOT included,"3 weeks since I got delivery of this saw. You must order the blade from them since none is included with a $1700 saw and it takes only 8 inch blades. Home Depot dosen't carry 8 inch blades. My saw motor came with a wobbly engine. When you put in the blade - of course properly and tighten it - it wobbles. I called and they asked me to go through milwakee's warantee. I am going there tomorrow and will report back. My advise, avoid this supplier."
3,"Cool Idea, but Short","Okay, when I saw this title I couldn't resist it. And I enjoyed reading it. But I would have been very disapointed had I paid full-price for it (I bought it used). It's a very short book, one of those with one quote per page (or two pages) that is about less than a hundred pages long. The intro was great, about half the sayings, yes, had swear words, but were also relevent and enjoyable, usually using profanity sparingly. The other half of the sayings were just obscene. If you see it at a used bookstore/library, go for it, but personally I wouldn't spend the full price."
3,Lacking in detail,"Immunology for Medical Students is a good overall resource but leaves you a little fuzzy about detail and scope. Overarching principles are presented clearly, but the text doesn't elaborate enough on important specifics such as VDJ recombination in lymphocytes and cytokine function. This text is insufficient for the current medical school course I am taking and wouldn't even have been adequate for the undergraduate immunology course I took a few years ago. Janeway's Immunobiology gives you a much better understanding of the topics, though it does probably go too far to the other side in providing detail."
4,Good study tool,"This book is great for brushing up on concepts quickly, expecially when exam times are approaching. I use it alot. However for indepth research i would suggest you use this in conjunction with your bigger, texts."
3,"Seems Ok, but I am no expert","Everything about the racket seems great except for the stringing. I bought two rackets to play with a friend and you don't get much pop off of the racket unless the ball is hit dead center. I am sure a more experienced player would tell me that I need to upgrade the strings, but I expected the performance of the strings to be a little better. All in all, a good buy for recreational tennis."
3,Tennis racket review,The tennis racket plays very well. At times I get some undue vibration that seems to come from the handle area. But overall I am well pleased.
4,Very comfortable and offers cushion,"I am an umpire and bought these as base shoes. I just put black over the white stripes. They were reasonably priced, have good traction, and are very supportive.They are sized small. I usually wear a men's 7 1/2 and ended up with an 8."
4,Erika tells it all n spiced it with her sense of humor!!!,"""It couldn't be better written than this!!! A great book for teens, and a Plus for parents to get to understand their girls what they go through in their academic life; although we all go through bullying; however, time changes and new ""Tricks"" are often created. That's Erika I know of, happy! happy! happy! and trying to share her laughter, love and self confidence to all..I like the qoutations at the beginning of every chapter, it gives the ""bullied"" or ""victim"" a sense of courage in handling the ""Mean Chicks""""Erika summarizes her ""Power of Several"" by recommending to the girls more books, magazines, and internet resources to help them get ""through the day with Smarts and Style""..Well done, Erika!!!"
4,GOOD BOOK!,"well, i bought this book cos i needed to know a little bit more about teenage behaviors and alittle of their psychology and stuff.well this is a book well written for girls between 12 and 15 it lets u know why girls behave one way and some others differently, it also says some good ways to deal with them or avoid them etc.it talks about, the bully, the drama queen etc etc. so its a nice book, i rate it with 4 because is not like a book to read is more like a manual.but anyways it helps"
5,"Mean chicks, cliques, and dirty tricks",Wonderful help for a 13 year old daughter. She read it with great interest and I feel it helped her understand some of the problems she is experiencing as a 13 year old
5,awesome!,"I highly suggest buying this album. teddy geiger is an amazing singer songwriter and is only 16. he is from rochester, ny and was just signed to columbia records. he was also on VH1 the Partridge Family: Battle of the Keiths. he is opening for hillary duff this summer and is an amazing kid! (...)"
5,"A ""Hallelujah"" of a Keepsake","A wonderful set of 6 acoustic songs which were written and performed by Teddy Geiger, this album went out of print before ""Underage Thinking"" was released in March of 2006. Hard to find, but a wonderful keepsake."
3,Great map but the guide is only okay,"The map that is included with the book is one of best Cape Town maps I have seen. It is a little big for walking around town (you look like a tourist with a capital ""T""!), but it has a street reference and all the tourist sites well marked. The book is more narrative than other guide books, and it is small, so it doesn't good into as much detail. As a tour operator for Adventures Within Reach, I recommend the map to my clients going to Cape Town, but I recommend other books to use as reference."
5,Can't get enough,"9 and 6 year old girls are hugh fans of Scooby and the gang. They are now enjoying Scrappy, too."
2,More fun with everyone included,"I prefer to watch the shows with all 6 members of the group (Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy) equally involved in solving a mystery."
1,incomplete episode,"The episode is supposed to be 20 minutes, but only 19:47 is here. It's frustrating to have the video end so abruptly, especially when Fred is summing up the solution to the mystery!Can this be fixed? If so, it's a terrific episode of Scooby & Scrappy and is worth watching."
4,Scrappy-Doo isn't that bad,"I would consider this first season the only season that is worthwhile in the Scrappy-Doo series. The gang is there and they find clues, which lead to a fake monster!"
5,No complaints,"Just like the wheels that come in the sets. Be careful not to use with material that is too thick, its meant for small jobs. Replace them often, they are not reinforced. There is a good reason why they are sold in a 36 pack."
3,Dremel cut-off wheels,"Found and purchased on line, fast delivery, easy to find as I don't need to drive around to find. New items packaged in original packaging. These wheels are fragile and for light use only."
3,get what you pay for,"They did the job, cutting .5"" thick plywood. It took a long time and went thru about half of these blades doing it. Had to cut both sides of wood to get complete cut, I should have looked at the dimensions of these blades prior to buying. Make sure you do not drop the blades or tighten them too much, as they are pretty fragile. I had a few break putting them on my dremel, but I guess that's why it's a pack of 36. For wood, I think when these run out, I'll buy a metal saw blades or the reenforced metal grinding blades. These are just too fragile for me and had multiple pieces fly and hit my face, but I might have been too close."
1,cut off wheels,"total waste of money ,don't know why they even bother making these. went through 2 packages of 36 each in one afternoon Advise every one to spend the extra and get the reinforced cut off disks much better value for the money."
1,Not so good,I try to cut wood with these discs. They are so easy to break. It also takes a lot of time to install and remove them. What hassle!
1,Do Not Buy,"Do Not Buy! Literally crumbled first time we used this product. Fortunately, had safety goggles on to protect from flying pieces."
1,Fragile and limited use,"Uh huh, I know they are supposed to be used gingerly- only at the edge... But when cutting at dremel RPM's - on any but the lightest materials, these fail.I mean, come on.. Who is cutting things with a dremel, in which you dont apply some sort of pressure? (Which usually sends the disk into several fragments)My dremel came with a pack of these and I spent more time screwing these things on the holder than actual use. Which sucks.Unless you are making tissue paper models or cutting whipped butter, get the reinforced disks, or the full fiber disks. In cost / time comparison with ANY other cutting disk, These are useless. Even the super cheap ""off-brand"" diamond wheels cost less, cut more."
3,Okay,"I had most of these songs already. I only bought this because of "" Dial My Heart "". In all fairness this is a very boring compilation album. At least the price was low or I wouldn't have thought twice about it. "" Dial My Heart "", "" Let it Whip "", and "" Super Freak "" are the only songs worth having. And I already had two of them."
4,Duel of the cheesy Kung Fu flic's,Picked it up for a buck at the local walmart. The Digiview release is of of course sub par in terms of quality and the movie was poorly cropped from its widescreen original. Nonetheless it serves to offer up a kung fu movie complete with halfway decent british dubbing and all the thwacking sound effects one comes to expect from such a film; can't go wrong for a buck.
5,Great Eclecticism,"Frank Zappa's post-Mothers (Flo + Eddie) material is prim yet fun. The musical direction of Chunga's Revenge is wholly eclectic---swopping from Jazz to Blues to Rock n' Roll. As remembered for their raunchy ditties, Flo + Eddie assumes a more ""genteel"" attitude on songs like ""Tell me You Love Me"" ""Would You Go All The Way"" and ""Sharleena"". I good Zappa album to start with. Also check Flo and Eddie's more daring songs on Zappa's 200 Motels."
3,"I know it's supposed to be a compilation of styles, but...","This is a CD that's all over the map--The Nancy and Mary Music and The Clap are garbage. The Flo and Eddie vocals are for the most part, great (not subject to the excesses that came later). However, why they used a slow rendition of Shaleena is beyond me; look for the version with Sugarcane Harris on vocals instead. Road Ladies always brings a smile to my face. The instrumentals are average--the title track stands out, but Transylvania Boogie is just a jam. No one could like this whole CD--it's just all over the map. It'll either be too pop for you, or too out there. Just take it for what it is, an OK record that was thrown together at the last minute."
4,My introduction to Zappaland,"A friend & I were flicking thru Rolling Stone & I said 'that guy's cool' & he said 'what would you know?' & lent me this lp. @ the time I was confused by how it was half instrumental & half vocal, which would faze me @ all now, in fact I witnessed someone in a shop trying Kind Of Blue & being surprised Miles Davis didn't sing. Anyway, this is a fine album, Transylvania Boogie is still mighty funky & I alwas was amused by Rudy, the last time I played the title track I thought the guitar sounded like a duck singing & that's not necessarily a bad thing. I think Flo & eddie did actually get better w/ Fillmore etc. The Clap isn't rubbish, it would be very useful for scratch DJs I think."
4,excellent,"Here is another Zappa disc that does not get its just due. True, Zappa put this out in between the origional Mothers and the Flo and Eddie band. Some say the material is fragmented. Diverse is more the correct term, and all the material is great.""Traselvana Boogie,"" is a fantastic gypsy rocker with great wha wha work by Zappa and some fantastic driving bass. ""Road Ladies,"" and ""Rudy Wants...."" show the vocal prowess of his new group. The suite that ends side one is pure Zappa, as editor and genre blender.Don't forget the great percussion experiment, ""The Clap,"" and the title track, which could have been an early 70s Miles Davis electric horn brew.And would not Deep Purple or Black Sabbath have killed to have ""Tell Me You Love Me"" as the A side of a single, its twisting opening riff accending like guitar DNA.Don't be a critic snob. This is great."
4,NOT HOT RATS BUT.......,"Not up to Hot Rats stellar standards but pretty damed good regardless. If you can't raise a smile out of ""Rudy Wants to Buy Yez a Drink"" you must be dead from the neck up!"
1,it's hard to read a book you did not receive almost 2 months after you ordered it.,"I paid for but did not yet receive this book, even after two complaints, so here's my third complaint.I'm sure it's a good book though, because I have read it before and it transformed my perception."
4,Time for a change,"After years of using Norton/Symantec products I finally got my fill. Their tech support being off shore stinks, especially the attitudes of the support staff. I also desired more control over the software. ZA gives me that control in an easy fashion."
2,Really Bogs Down systems,"I have ran Zone Alarm and Zone Alarm Pro for a few years so I thought stepping up to Security Suite was a natural. I have never used any system that bogs down a computer so much. I have done the many fixes that are in the blog and no luck. I am not even going to finish out the year with this. I know it is nice have a secure system, but it isn't worth the time I wait with Zone Alarm Suite."
1,Highly Dissapointed,I installed the software on a new Dell Latitude running XP and it absolutely made the system run as if it was sitting in sludge. It took at least 2-3 minutes to launch a new browser virtually locking up the system. When I tried to launch Outlook the system felt as if it was running in reverse. I have never installed software that has corrupted the system processes as bad as this one has. As soon as I disabled the software the system ran as it had before. I am not willing to take the additional time to see if the software was conflicting with any other software running. I have used the free version of the firewall in the past and have been very happy with it. I unistalled the suite and re-installed the free Zonealarm and everything is running fine.
1,BEWARE OF THIS SYSTEM RESOURCE PIG!!!!,"I kid you not, this suite,program,resource *THUG* IS THE WORST GARBAGE ON THE MARKET. Like others i read the shiny reviews and took a chance and purchasing it because of the frequent trips to HELL I had logged in with other so called ""SECURITY SUITES"" over the years. Works ok for about the first month or so and then...WHAMMMM..crash city. Think I'm joking...buy it and find out for yourself. I'm no PRO yet, but i do have enough knowledge about programming to know when my PC goes from( NORMAL to CHOKE) out of the clear blue. Uinstalled it (3X) just to make sure that it was the cause of the problem,sure enough,it was. Other reviewers mentioned thier processor being pulled to the grind...well it's true. STAY AWAY...STAY FAR..FAR..AWAY."
5,"Small Footprint, Strong Security","As the reviews all say, the GUI is fairly user friendly and the three main parts (firewall, anti-virus, and anti-spyware) all work well. I found one virus and 3-4 spyware programs that our Norton suite had not detected on the computers where this was installed. Couple that with a smaller impact on the performance level of older systems (noticeable difference after taking Norton off) and the company is quite happy."
2,Unpleasant Suprise,"I purchased this product after reading many negative reviews on other products (my last Internet security product was PC-Cillin, I didn't renew because of the Low ratings for 2007). What I found was that an huge load was put on my processor, and system memory apparently because I use a program that feeds video over the internet from a network cam. I never had problems like this before, and after some research on the ZA support site, I found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking. VSMON.exe seems to be the culprit, and is the main component of the Zone Alarm product. Everything seems fine, as long as I don't try to use video over the internet(including IM webcams). I would recommend thinking about if you intend on using webserver programs before making this purchase."
2,Had some problems,"This program has some features that I like, but in the end I had some problems and switched to Norton Internet Security. After one user logged into XP, nobody else could because the password input boxes would no longer take input. I also had the runaway process issue with vsmon.exe. The process would take up more and more memory until the computer was swapping so much you couldn't use it. To be fair, these two issues were resolved with a clean reinstall, but what happened on the first install?The third issue that I had was a startup timing problem between ZoneAlarm and Outlook Express which forced a restart of Outlook fairly often. I probably could have solved that too but I just decided to stop and switch to another program."
2,Can we have a more honest review of ZAS-7? Thanks.,"I must question the vocacity of this and similar reviews here that report how easy it is to install and operate NAS 7. I've been researching the major AV suite programs and reviews for 2 weeks. I was leaning towards NAS 7 until I read numerous posts on their own forum that report problems with install and operation. I am concerned with 3 issues their own moderator disclosed on 1-17-07: 1) error in Windows security cebter alert; 2) expert rules are not saved after restart; and 3) kl1 service can really slow the program. There were also valid complaints with issues relating to the existance of other AV files and programs still present during install. I currently have Norton Internet Security 2005, so if I can't get an honest review, I'll have no choice but to continue subscriptions on my current AV suite. I could also upgrade to NIS 2007 and improve performance via disable auto-updates! Can we have a more honest review of ZAS-7? Thanks."
1,Don't Buy It,"If you have AOL, Zone Alarm Internet Security will give you hours of grief before you uninstall it and buy Norton. There is no support to help you get through the problems."
2,Not User Friendly on VISTA,"Bought this in May 2007. Product literature claims to be ""VISTA Ready"" and is licensed for 3 computers. Had no trouble with the first two installations on XP, but will not install on VISTA. You need to download a new file from the web, which you can't find by yourself. You need to e-mail tech support (they don't have free tech support by phone), and get a link to a web page to download the file. When you try to install this file, it probably won't install correctly. Back to tech support e-mails. At that point, you get 4 pages of instructions, which include booting in safe mode, running ""regedit"", deleting registry keys manually, etc. I did get the program running, but took many hours spread out over several weeks.The program itself is satisfactory. Has problems that seem endemic to all firewall programs.Bottom line: price is good but unless you are extremely experienced (and patient), you may want to use something else on a VISTA machine."
3,Big memory hog,"I updated from Norton AV 2006 and the free ZA firewall. The latest update for ZA 7 fixed the slow boot problem for me. Scans are reasonably quick and the interface is usable and familiar after years with the free firewall.However, the vsmon process grew quickly to over 67MB of RAM and with the other three processes started by ZA, the total memory usage was over 125MB. I find that to be unacceptable and will try NIS 2007 next."
1,Great Product... but very tardy keeping up-to-date,"This a bar-none the best Internet Security Suite available... if you are satisfied with running obsolete operating systems. It is a travesty that Checkpoint still hasn't gotten a Vista compatible version out the door, and their website implies that Vista is still a future prodect for Microsoft. Shame on them!"
4,ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite,If you like ZA 6.x you'll like ZA 7. The virus/ spyware scan engine is less processor intensive than v5 and v6 and is an upgrade over previous versions in detection. I would still like to see Zonelabs and some features to the parental control portion of the suite but overall ZA 7 is one of the better security suites available. No Vista support.
5,This program works well....,"I downloaded the trial version of this software from the Zonelabs website without any problems. I have been using this program for approximately one month without any difficulties, glitches, irritations, or troubles. I tried other major utilities such as Mcafee and Norton. Both are pricey and worn-out. Norton was drastically slowing down my computer. I also experimented with Panda Security Suite and Pc-cillin. I did not experience any major issues as some users suggest and report. I decided to go with ZoneAlarm Security Suite due to good reviews and recommendations by various computer experts..."
3,Goofball music.,"Mr. Basbeball wasn't a particularly good movie and it was obvious that Goldsmith had more than a bit of a struggle trying to come up with suitable themes and motifs for this fish out of water comedy.The main title is good, a funny mixing of the standard baseball organ theme heard at every professional game and some cliched japanese motifs. Other than that the score is lacking. Not one of Goldsmith's best."
4,"moody, bohemian folk","If you have a penchant for moody, mysterious songs, ethereal vocals, and ringing acoustic timbres, you'll flip over this Robyn Hitchcock album. Backed by the brilliant duo of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings (the latter also produced Spooked), Hitchcock spins an unpredictable web of psychedelic, bohemian, and folky sounds. Layers of understated guitar, Dobro, Wurlitzer, and percussion draw you in, while allowing Hitchcock's expressive voice and edgy lyrics to dominate the mix. Rawlings has a knack for crafting unusual guitar parts -- sometimes his 6-string drones like a dulcimer, sometimes it shimmers like a miniature piano. Though quiet, this album is intense, and snippets of odd sounds dart here and there adding an eerie vibe to the essentially acoustic tracks. Hitchcock's comic impersonation of an interplanetary tour guide keeps this dazzling work from getting too dark."
4,My Son Loves It,"My 6 yr old son loves Bionicles and now enjoys the Piraka line. He loves the glowing eyes and having ""battles"" with the others. Sometimes I need to help him, but overall, he can build 95% of it himself and he is proud of his accomplishment."
5,A fine addition to the Vorkosigan series,"I am another person who normally doesn't write reviews, but I also have to disagree with the negative review citing ""paper-thin characters"" below. In fact, I think characterization is what LMB excels at, and this book is a good addition to the series featuring Miles Vorkosigan, one of the most interesting characters in science fiction.It is also a classic ""transition"" book in the series, so it definitely shouldn't be the first one you read. I would recommend either ""Borders of Infinity"" (EXCELLENT short stories that span Miles' career) or ""Warrior's Apprentice"" (the first novel featuring a more-or-less adult Miles) for an introduction to Miles Vorkosigan. But it definitely adds a delightful twist to Miles' story, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has read and enjoyed the series."
4,zappa at the Height of his Power. A must for fans!,"One of the more accessible of Zappa's albums, it also shows his band at the strongest. Mocking diners, Roger daltrey, the American Bicentennial and, breakfast foods. Enough said."
4,Solid Zappa,"This is a very good album by Zappa with a little help from Captain Beefheart. It is mostly live taken from a concert (or mostly likely series of concerts knowing Zappa's affinity for splicing tape) in 1975. The musicianship is topnotch as is the case with most every Zappa recording...Beefheart's nonsensical ""beat"" poetry can be off-putting but taken with a touch of satire works well. If you are a Zappa fan already then this is a purchase you will enjoy, that said this is not an album I would use to get someone introduced to Zappa."
5,carolina hard core ecstacy and capt beef all in one!!,"CHE is a great song, and with captain beefheart reading two of his brilliant word poems with FZ's band sorta backing him up should really make the hair stand up on your arms. 200 years old is another great song, and muffin man is a song that made steve vai take up guitar. Great Great stuff."
4,kiss and make up,Zappa and the captain maintained a strained relationship and it shows on this album. Zappa's albums are not neccessarily coherent in te way you expect other artists to be. On this occasion however it is a varied album for the wrong reasons. Great tracks (Carolina's hard core ecstacy is seriously underrated) mix with silly tracks (200 years is way too silly) and Beefheart seems strangely out of place. I always think the two of them could have made a better album together.
4,two big egos of the music era together,"It's fun to have a bit more material with the voice of the beloved Captain Beefheart on it.He and Zappa were childhood friends who in time grew to be more like a tired married couple.There's a good video out there from the 90's that tells the tale of Zappa giving Beefheart this gig out of the kindness of his heart, the flipside of course is that Beefheart also gave Zappa a vocalist Par excellence.It's a quirky mix of music and prose, but definitely more on the Zappa side of theatrical composition with electric instruments."
5,A beaut!,I bought this for Mom's red kitchen and everytime I see her she thanks me this for this coffee pot. It's stunning and a true red that only cuisnart pulls off. Don't skimp on money with coffee pots. You get what you pay for and with this coffee pot - you get a lot. Highly recomended.
3,complicated cleaning,Makes good coffee but has five separate parts that have to be disassembled and cleaned when the grinder is used to make coffee. Three are in the basket assembly and two in the grinder assembly. The Melitta grind & brew machine is equally as good and much simpler to clean with the basket and grinder assembly combined (I've owned both and wish I'd bought another Melitta). Cleaning is much faster and simpler. The only disadvantage to the Melitta is that it is a 10 cup machine rather than 12. If you don't need the 12 cups the Mellita MEMB1B or MEMB10B is a much better choice.
2,Save your money.,"My white KitchenAid coffee maker was looking nasty and old so instead of waiting for the new model, I bought this Cuisinart. I used it for four days. It's now in the garage. It absolutely drove me nuts. The lid for pouring in the water doesn't open far enough to clear the carafe so I ended up spilling half the water. And the basket thingie won't close if the basket is off a millimeter. And besides, I don't think the coffee was all that great for $70. So now I'm back to my 4-Cup blue KitchenAid and saving my dough for another big KitchenAid."
2,Dislike button pause and pour,"I am not a fan of the pause and pour feature. IT is a button and if the pot is not directly under button the coffe over flows. On two occasions the machine stopped dripping coffee in the pot, casing grounds to overflow the filter. I can only assume the pot was not perfectly placed. I searched for a red coffee maker at a resonable price but could find none without this type of pause and pour. I may have to remove button for 100% satisfaction. But I love the red accents in my kitchen."
1,"Nice sound, good price, but flatulent!","I like everything about this woofer, except the fact that--when it goes into power-saving ""sleep"" mode--it lets out a loud sound that my wife says is a snore, but I say it's a fart. Either way, we're returning it, since it wakes us up when we've fallen asleep during the music, and it emits this loud-but-odorless flatulence every 10 minutes or so when we've got the volume of the music down low."
1,bbbrrrAAAAAAPPPPPP!!!!,"As others have mentioned, this subwoofer makes a very loud and rather impolite sound when it decides to go to standby mode. And many times it'll go noisily into standby in the middle of a song/movie. I thought I had a bum unit and tried the 8"". Same thing! I'm no audiophile, and I hardly think it takes a purist to be turned off by the sound of something occasionally relieving itself in the corner of your living room.It's hard to believe Jensen continues to sell this thing with such an obvious and annoying flaw. Might be good as a novelty/joke item. Otherwise, avoid."
2,Good while it lasted,Purchased this item in July. Worked fine for 2 months then started leaking. Put in 4 cups of water and got 3 cups of espresso and 1 cup of water on the kitchen counter. Ordered a different brand espresso maker. Hopefully will get more than 3 months service ouf of this new one.
5,Good Purchase,i am using this sheath for Charge TTI it fits ok and in my honest opinion this sheath is much better than any on the market at the moment
2,"Good try, but falls short on quality","The quality of the sheath is not the best, as there is no edge treatment on the leather. Mine was also slightly offset in the snap placement so the flap is not quite perpendicular when closed. There is also no option for horizontal orientation on the belt, as I had hoped."
4,Updated picture,"Disregard the previous feedback about it being a ""sheath different than the one pictured."" The picture has been updated. I called the seller, he got back to me quickly stating he had posted the picture himself.Product cons: this sheath is designed for the older ""original version"" [...] of the leatherman wave. It's a little too tight for the newer style [...]I've had waves for years and push my equipment to the limit. This type of sheath tends to last me about a one to two years of daily use on everything from canoeing, to logging, to cold winter hiking. The part to go is often the upper stitching of the belt loop on the back. That said, it's still one of the better sheaths around for the original wave."
2,"Updated - new picture, same not-so-great product","I called AllSparesTools (the listed source for these sheathes) to veryify that they had _exactly_ the sheath pictured on amazon.com. The man at AllSparesTools assured me repeatedly that they did. No such luck! The sheath I received is the same fairly disappointing model other reviewers complained about. It really is not nearly the quality of the old style (as pictured), although it does get the job done.Update: Amazon has changed the picture to reflect the actual product. Be aware that the old ""horizontal logo"" sheathes were much higher quality than this current version."
2,Be Warned,"Customer be warned! The leatherman pouch you will recieve is not the one pictured. I made the mistake of ordering this product before reading any reviews. When I got it in the mail I thought that Amazon got my order wrong. Then when I read the other customer reviews I understood. The pouch that you will get is a less expensive made leather one. While it still is a good quaility pouch. It is lighter color leather, thinner and the botton just says leatherman and does not have the leatherman tool logo on it. It also says Leatherman in gold lettering accross the bottom part of the pouch not Leatherman Wave on top like the one pictured."
1,Again Amazon fools us with the WRONG picture,"[...]I say ""added"" because the sheath here is not the sheath pictured above. The sheath you are purchasing here is lighter brown and much more flimsy. [...]I purchased this product specifically because I have the sheath you will receive and was disappointed with it."
2,Not as pictured,"As another review stated, the sheath I received is not the same style as the one I received. I have one of sheaths in the style pictured and it just looks better that the ones they are sending now. Maybe that's why they used a picture of the older style in the ad."
5,Excellent pouch!,"I bought this to wear to work/meetings because I like to keep my Leatherman but hate the sporty looking pouches they come with (unless you spend more than $100 on one), it is very nice and fits my Blast, though it is a bit tight its getting better with a little stretching. The snap is a tad strong but nothing worth complaining about, especially since I lost my last tool to the fact the sheath was velcro and barely worked. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a nice Leatherman pouch."
5,Great sheath.,Fits Leatherman Wave black oxide. Thick leather and very durable. I was very impressed with the quality.If you have a Leatherman you need this.
2,Not what I expected,"The leather is very stiff, it doesn't seem like a very high grade of leather, but almost pleather like unfortunately. My Leatherman Wave got stuck in the sheath and required a bit of force to get it out at one point. With it being of such low quality, I was disappointed in this product and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Having all the problems that I did, it just doesn't get used anymore. I really had high hopes for it and really didn't think it could be that bad, but I wish I never bought it. Since I guess it does technically hold the Wave, I will update it to two stars even though I can barely get it out. I haven't tried oiling it, as the comment below mentioned, but to me, I shouldn't have to do that to something I just purchased."
1,I ordered 2 and they both broke...,"I ordered 2 of these cases hoping that I could use them with my leatherman wave for the next several years... The first sheath broke within a month (the belt loop ripped off). The second sheath also broke within a month (the button ripped off). Although this sheath is better than the factory issued one, I cannot recommend this leather sheath due to the poor build quality... I would not purchase again."
4,Very tight ;),"I'm not sure this was ""designed"" for the wave, as my wave only fits in one direction; my wave fits skinny-side down. It's brand new so it will definitely stretch over time, but i'm not sure it will stretch enough to fit how i wanted it to fit, which is hinge-side (thick) side down. skinny-side down it's no problem - very tight, but no problem (that's what she said). on initial use, hinge-side down is a no-go. maybe after a few months it will open up but i will wait; thus the 4-star rating. i would have given 5 stars if it had fit hinge-side down on initial use. thank you!edit: after inserting my wave into this sheath, skinny-side down, i find that it is almost impossible to remove. it's about 5 minutes later from my initial review and i still cannot extract my wave from this all leather sheath. i know it will come out eventually, and will be easier to extract in the future, but for now it's thoroughly ensconced in the leather. hope this helps."
1,cheap,"This product is very cheaply made out of stiff thin leather, the belt loop on the holder ripped after the first time I used it:-( I would not recomend this product to anyone!!!!!!!!"
1,Broken in half a year,"I had been using a former model for around ten years without problem. I replaced it with the new model in May of this year, but the belt holder came off in half a year. I'm very disappointed with it."
3,I JUST RECIVED THE RIDGID RG-10,"UPON RECIVING THE RG-10,FOR USE WITH 10 oz. CARTRIDGES.I DISCOVERED THAT RIDGID DOES MAKE A 30 oz. POWER PUSH # RG-30."
1,Extremely Limited Information,"I have several great Falcon Guides, but this is certainly not one of them. There are not maps of the campsites and there is very limited information provided for each. The author does not often mention whether camps have shoreline sites, whether there are hiking opportunities nearby, whether the noise level is low or high, or whether pets are welcome. You basically don't get a very good idea of where you are going or what makes the different sites special. In addition, the books skips over a great number of great campgrounds. You can easily find better information on the internet for free.""Moon Montana, Wyoming & Idaho Camping"" is a much better and more thorough choice - and it covers three states!"
4,A Little Misleading,"Due to the title I assumed that this DVD would primarily focus on the alphabet, something my daughter and I have been working on over the last couple of months, you can imagine my surprise when the entire first 21 mins of the video was just shapes. Of course if you're more careful then I am about reading the information and finding out everything about the DVD, then you will find yourself with a great video for learning a lot about shapes and a little about your ABC's. My daughter knows all her shapes so it didn't help us much, but I will save it for my son for when we are working on his shapes. Also I like to know how long these things are and can't seem to find the info, this DVD is 126 mins long including special features, it has a bonus episode that is 30 mins long."
4,One of the better ones..,I bought this for my 1 1/2 yr old daughter and she loves it! She actually learned from the video!!! She now knows most of her ABC's and different shapes and colors! The quality of the video is very good overall. I used to watch Barney videos from the past on VHS and they were horrible. This title is well edited and the acting is above average. All the songs are great too! I am planning to buy more Barney videos.
3,It's ok,"Barney is barney, I guess my toddler liked it, very cheesy. It is an okay children's show, nothing to write home about."
3,Son not so crazy about it !,"My son isn't so crazy about the new Barney guy, and I wish that there was actually more ABCs on this DVD."
4,Kids love it what can I say.,I don't understand the phenomena but my loves the purple pill. Anything Barney seems to be a winner.
3,not what i expected.,i bought this and the number dvd because my son had been very interested in some old barney videos i had from 10 years ago. he was not interested in these new dvds the way he is with the older versions. seems like the older videos are more interesting and songs easier to follow.
2,Barney: Now I know my ABCs DVD,"I only have one comment to say. This product took a month and a half to get to me. That was way too long seeing that I ordered another product at the same time on the same day that showed up within two weeks after purchase. I understand there are some delays due to wheather and all, but as I stated the other product I ordered showed up in two weeks."
3,less than expected,"I was looking for a much larger Barney - I don't believe there was a size description, so my fault for assuming it was a larger doll - maybe the brand name gets the price, but I wouldn't have spent that much had I known the size."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ALPHABET DVD,Mostly about shapes and colors. What a waste of my 25 month year old's time. He was bored of it easily because he enjoys letters and being stimulated. I feel very mislead by the title.
5,Good video,"All of my children have grown up on Barney. They especially enjoy the songs which teach the children life skills, the alphabet, and counting. I definitely recommend this video."
3,This is a very good book for lots a knock knocks,If you want to learn a lot of good knock knock jokes this is just for you for you.
4,Excellent Protein Bar,"This is my quick protein after a workout. They are VERY sweet, but with 22 grams of protein, 9 grams of fiber and completely organic, well worth it."
3,Awesome Ingredients,"This food bar has a great mix of ingredients, however, the flavor is a bit odd. It's okay. Great, quick snack/meal filler, but not the best flavor."
2,tastes rancid,"great ingredients, but tastes odd, kind of rancid even though the exp date is next year. I don't know if it hasn't been stored correctly or this is just the way it tastes."
3,Pretty good but like Belgium Chocolate Chip much better!,"These are sooooo sweet that I can hardly eat them. I like them okay but the Belgium Chocolate chip of this brand is the only ones I'll repurchase because they have a fantastic chocolate all through the bar that makes them rich like a dessert. I buy these from the actual website of the company who currently sells them and I love what's in them hence my 3 stars. I wish they would cut down on the sweetness, it's so sweet it almost gags me. Too sweet for an energy bar but still....great, great ingredients for healthy living."
2,"300 calories, texture of paste or play-dough","Having tried the Green+ bars and been disappointed, I was excited to try these Active Greens bars based on the positive reviews here on Amazon. Boy, was I let down. These bars have the texture of paste, and a lingering aftertaste that is reminiscent of aspartame or splenda. They are also loaded with fat and calories, making them the caloric equivalent of a personal lasagne or half a pizza!For the price, these bars are a total rip-off. If you really want green foods in your diet, take Green Vibrance powder in the morning like I do. It tastes wonderful and mixes easily with rice milk. In the meantime, people should actually taste one of these before buying the box. Because these Active Green bars are pretty deadly.I would describe them as slightly better than astronaut ice cream and comprable to play-dough. Avoid these and try the Pure Bars or Larabars, which are delicious and have 40% less calories.Or buy these and reget it...It's your choice."
2,Tastes bad,"The problem is the taste. It's very bad. I and everyone I've shared them with agrees. I have had Organic Food Bar's blueberry and other varieties which I liked v. much. This protein variety just doesn't taste good at all---the rice protein flavor is in full force. Try one before you buy a box, or you'll be counting down the days till you've finished of the $2 bars! The nutritional stats of course are great.That said, I don't know of a good soy-free vegan bar with so much protein. Let us know if you find one!"
5,Protein bar review,"The protein bar has a good taste and excellent nutrition. The fiber helps mitigate the 18g of sugar, none of which is processed sugar. The 22g of protein provide a steady source of fuel for any activity. On this listing, there is a label showing a bar with 22g of sugar, which was the content in an earlier version of the protein bar. Check out the Active green bar, which has 30% more sugar."
4,One of the Best Out There But....,"i find them to be too sweet! they are definitely tasty and you're getting fiber to the max, a good amount of protein and some calcium as well. the ingredients are alkalizing too, which is an added plus. to improve these bars, i would decrease the sugar and add some vitamins to the mix. even though these are very sweet for me, i still eat them a few times a week, but by the end, i find i'm forcing it down. i've considered starting to eat just 1/2 a bar. another con to these is the relatively high calories at 300 per bar, but it makes a good meal replacement."
3,"Appreciate the ingredients, but not for me","I really wanted to like this bar, and I appreciate the ingredients and the protein content, but I can't eat a whole one. They are too sweet for me and the texture is too uniform and blah in my opinion."
4,Slicing guide is great,"This is an average electric knife, but the bread slicing guide is very helpful in getting even slices from bread, meat, or whatever. I have had it for several years, and use it all the time. Just recently the knife is working erratically so it is time for a new one, but the slicing guide will go on forever!"
3,"ok, did not fit my needs","I liked that this gate was mechanical(did not require power), but I found it a little flimsy and unreliable. The gates would often not lift or lower in unison. They sometimes lifted only midway, where a car would not be able to pass."
5,Worth every penny!,"I love, love, LOVE this shower head. It's HUGE- kind of feels like taking a shower outside during a warm, torrential rainstorm. I was a bit reticent to purchase this because of the price, but I can now say it was definitely worth it. Installation was quick and easy, and the directions were very clear. Highly recommended!(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
3,How to increase water flow,"I also have this shower head, first thing I did was remove the ball assembly to expose the orange regulator, then with an blade i cut the center out and put it back in with the screen. I also removed the shower head face and drilled out the two side holes a little larger. Now the shower head has much heavier flow and feel."
2,Impractical,Danze is a good company but this head it truly a rain shower head. It needs to be a straight overhead fixture as there is minimal water pressure with this head
4,wish it was the larger one,"I had the larger version (10"") and lost it. The other one was unavailable so I ordered this one which is listd as 8"". It seems to me that it isn't just 2"" shorter in overall length but is actually smaller overall. That is, the prybar is narrower and the nail puller is smaller. I can't compare them side by side b/c I lost the bigger one, but this is the feeling I am left with.Still its a solid bar. I like that you can whack the end with your hammer and the fish tail (forged steel) is tough enough to just slice through nails/screws that may be holding the piece.You might also consider a set of theseTitan 17005 Stainless Steel Prybar and Scraper Set - 2 PieceI use these prybars all of the time for levering off moldings, trim, t&g; flooring, siding etc. They are really strong and sharp too."
2,"Nope, This Is Not The One","This is made in China and is not as thin and finely tapered as the original Japanese version.It's OK, but it's a BIG disappointment if you were looking for the original. At this price it should be the gen-u-ine article, Made In Japan!"
4,"The Shark is great, but Red Devil is Better","I take molding and casing apart everyday. While I use the Shark all the time, I reach for Red Devil's Scrape'n Pry Bar #4050 more. Combine the Shark with the Red Devil tool and a 3"" flexible scraper (to open up a small gap)and you will be unstoppable!"
3,ITS RELATIVELY HIGH PRICE DRAGS IT DOWN,"For the size of this book, the listed price is clearly on the high side. But if that wouldn't deter you, then, get ready to savour a delicious series of well-documented medical information.This fully revised new edition of the ""Tropical Medicine and Parasitology"" maintained the tradition of providing succinct clinical information. Its principles, techniques and consistency makes it unique. The textbook is particularly useful for tracking down summarized topics.However, it is very $$$ when compared to similar good texts."
4,Good book for tropical medicine,This book is a good resource for tropical medicine. It is well-written and the pictures are of high-quality. I have used it durring medical missions and it has proven very helpful as a reference.
5,The real deal for working folks,"Speaking as someone who doesn't have a trust fund or live off the dividends from their investments--in other words, someone who needs their paycheck to survive--I found this book to be invaluable. The author definitely knows his stuff, and he gets beyond the usual spin on the ""spend less than you earn"" convention wisdom that usually comes packaged in books like this--instead, he offers real-life investing strategies that work. If you're serious about building wealth and your last name isn't Rockefeller, then this is the book for you."
5,A great book for me and the masses.,"In his new book, Building Wealth in a Paycheck-to-Paycheck World, Paul Petillo shines a light on the path to economic empowerment for all the sorry saps like me who've never learned the art of saving and investing our hard earned money. It's all too easy in this consumer based market to spend every dime we make without having anything solid to show for it.But, as it turns out, I can save and invest my income so that as the years roll on I'll have substantial wealth as a reward for my hard work. Petillo breaks it down for us with easy to obsorb instructions and insites.I highly recommend his book to anyone weary of the never ending hand-to-mouth cycle of earning and spending."
1,Waste of time...,"A dull collection of anecdotes and simplistic definitions of financial terms likely gathered from Wikipedia.This may be a worthwhile read if you fall into one of the following categories:1) You have never heard of a mutual fund or REIT.2) You have never taken a basic Finance course.3) You are under the age of 16.4) You do not currently utilize a budget.If for some reason you do read this, please do not make any investment decisions based on the advice in this book. The information is outdated for 2012 and was only marginally relevant at the time it was written."
5,Cute and compact just want I wanted,"I love it. Compact, simple design, easy settings. Easy to use and with the container so easily used to pour out the coffee."
4,"Good for grinding, cord not hidable","Although it says in the description that the cord is easily hidable, I still haven't found a way to hide it within the grinder, since neither the manual is explaining how. Otherwise a good grinder, nice and stulish."
2,"Looks good, works bad","This looks great - nice red color, but I am disappointed in its performance. My old Braun coffee grinder took 33 secs to grind coffee to espresso style fine powder. This new machine took 1 min 30 secs to grind, which is 3 times as long. The blades look dull, even brand new.The motor is fine, probably as strong as the Braun, but the blades did not do the job.I still find the Braun grinder superior to every other version. Note: do not buy Braun if its made in Mexico, as these versions 'leak' coffee dust into the motor - the seals are a problem. I wrote repeatedly to Braun, but to no effect. Use the Braun models made in Spain - absolutely the best! Stay away from Cuisinart, they need to improve the product."
5,Excellent equipment,"I am very satisfied with this Cuisinart product. Not only is the color great, but the rpm is slower than other grinders, making it much quieter. The metal reservoir is of higher quality and all of the ground coffee easily tumbles into the lid.I would recommend this product to everyone."
5,Powerful Cuisinart Coffee Grinder Works Great,Works great and grinds all the coffee beans the first time. The grinder is compact and the color matches my current (other brand) red coffee maker. Very reasonable price.
4,Changing Dowager,"The text is a serious work of fiction. I learned much about the people and the time they lived in. Overall, the picture of China at the time seemed to be accurate. The flaw of the book is the facts available have changed the portrait of the Dowager Queen. These facts were not available to Buck at the time. But I think the ruthless and political infighting would have been the same if for a different reason."
4,Highly enjoyable read,"This story is set as a biography of Yehonala/Yehenara/Tzu Hsi/Empress Dowager Cixi, and was overall a good read. But as a novel only, mind you.The details of Tzu Hsi's life (especially her early life) are largely unknown, and many people smeared her good name (like Edmund Backhouse), so this novel is meant to be just that - a novel, because in this story, Yehenara has an affair - one of the many Backhouse spread, though Pearl Buck's portrayal of Cixi is much, MUCH kinder even with the affair (and a few other things later on in the story) This was written in an era where Edmund Backhouse's filthy (and later revealed to be false) stories of Yehenara were still widely believed (and used as a source!) It should not be read as an actual biography of Tzu Hsi's life, though I still recommend this book as a good read/novel. If you enjoyed Ms. Buck's other works, you will definitely enjoy this."
3,It works but...,Excellent tape. The only problem is that the tape twisted far too easily and now is a little difficult to use. The magnets don't help or hurt. The numbers are very easy to read from distance.
2,Not a True Blue by Any Means,"While Special Effects is the BEST semi-permanent hair color out there, Blue Velvet falls very short where the actual color is concerned. I read all the reviews stating it was more of a purple than blue but decided to try it anyway. Needless to say, upon receipt of the color, it didn't even LOOK blue in the bottle, let alone on my hair (which is bleached up to almost platinum). It was very dark and had a strong purple hue to it; with each shampoo, it turned more and more purple. NOT BLUE. I must admit that the purple is brilliant and I'm getting tons of compliments but I wanted blue. So if you want an amazing purple, get the Blue Velvet. If you want a true blue, well, I'm going to try the Electric Blue next and see how that comes out. I really, really wanted a deep royal blue but Special Effects doesn't seem to have one yet. Hopefully, they will reconfigure the Blue Velvet formula or come up with something new soon."
3,"Stays forever, but not blue","This was my first time dying my hair something so colorful, and it worked better than expected. After bleaching my hair, I used Blue Velvet and Fishbowl Special Effects hair colors. I put the dye on and kept it in much longer than the recommended 15-30 minutes, as per advice I found on the web, more like 2-3 hours. The Blue Velvet turned out very dark, and definitely purple, not blue. However, with washing it every third day, using cold water, it stayed nice for 2 months, fading a little bit to a pretty dark/medium purple. It might have even gone longer, but I'm trying to wash it out now. I probably wouldn't use this specific color again, but I would use the Special Effects dye."
4,Love the color it gives,"I love the color this product creates however it only lasts about a week, you then get a week of purple hair, then like kelly osbourn grey."
2,Works better than any other product I've found but still washes out fairly fast.,"This is a great item for blondes, however, my hair is black & I was just trying to give it that blue highlight, well like every other colored hair dye I tried (Manic Panic, Splat), it did a much better job of dying my scalp than my actual hair. It washed out within a week. I was disappointed & was looking forward to that nice blue highlight in the black hair but I didn't get it for long."
2,Stains way to easy.,"When I read to be prepared for bleeding nothing could have prepared me for how bad it was. I did my full head. To start off it stained almost everything it touched from skin, my shower, my sink. I'd hate to see what it would have done to walls/floor! Then it would bleed and dye my forehead and neck purple (it was blue dye) so I was constantly rubbing my forehead and neck to keep it off. I ordered Blue Velvet and it went right to purple. Yes, I followed the directions. :) As for how long it stayed in the hair. This was pretty good. It stayed in for about 2 weeks, some parts a little longer. This was washing my hair once a day in luke warm water. So if your looking at doing just to top parts of your hair (nothing that rubs on skin) its worth it. Or as long as your careful when using/rinsing it out (stains)."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"I bought two fans from Amazon, Kensington 62648 FlyFan USB Notebook Fan and the Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan.Kensington FlyFan is noisy, it has a high pitch noise that is quite annoying. I used it for only 4 hours, and it has been sitting in my desk drawer ever since. Total waste of money!!!If your need a fan for your laptop, go with Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan instead. My Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan is plugged in 24x7, it's cheap, quiet, and worth every penny!!!"
3,USB Flyfan,Pros: Neat little gadget. Provides extra ventilation. Runs off of USB. Stiff but flexible neck. Soft flexible nylon blades.Cons: A bit noisy if you're in a quiet environment. No on/off switch.
5,This thing is great!!,"I work in a room that is pretty cramped and has no HVAC (temporary space) and this fan is EXCELLENT!! It's a clever, useful little gimmick."
1,"Good idea, bad implementation","I saw this item advertized and thought, ""Wow, that's a great idea."" So I ordered two, one for my laptop and one for my PC. The fan-blades are soft, and the thing puts out plenty of cooling air... when it works. The motor's sealed-in, however, so it overheats, and Kensington even included a temperature-switch to cut the fan off when it becomes too warm; unfortunately, this means that to restartn the fan, you apparently hyave to remove it from the USB port and set it aside for awhile. Also unfortunately, the fan overheated in *both* of mine after 5-10 minutes, every time. Now, after a grand total of 2 hours use of each, they're dead as doornails; the motors are toast. Basically... don't waste your money."
2,Err...,"I was hoping that by getting this I'd get a decent flow of air and i'd be able to use it anywayer. But I was sorely dissappointed. It doesn't give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel... plus its too loud to use in most places...If you really need it, you can get it... but I can't use mine often because like I said its too loud. Not worth it, not enough air flowing."
1,DO NOT BUY WITH ALLEGRO,"Ordered This product from Allegro on the 20th, supposed to ship from the 23rd-24th, It was supposed to be delivered from the 26th-31st.Nothing received so far. I receive an email on the 31st informing me that the item is backordered, and will not be SHIPPED until the 16th of the NEXT MONTH. To this date Allegro still has this item marked as ""in stock"" on the amazon site and their own website. Unacceptable for this to be labeled as such and for it to take over 26 days for an item to ship.I ordered it from a different company, Should be a good product but do not buy from Allegro. Their customer service didn't seem to have a concern about this either."
4,One Bad-ass Ab Roller...,"Far better than any other ab roller in existence. The exercises you can do--especially chest exercises--are fantastic.Minus one star, though, because the straps could be better for bare feet, and the retainer tubing (around the heel) could be a bit more stable."
3,"Great fun, shame about the recording standard","I'm glad that this Zappa recording is still available, but it's not a vital contribution to the development of either rock music or comedic theatre. The humour is, frankly, very teenage schoolboy -- i.e. strong sexual content, as it's called these days -- and only raises its interest level when making side-swipes at the cultureof the day (e.g. the Vanilla Fudge and the Edgewater Inn, Seattle).The standard of musicianship is, as ever, high, when you can discern it. Sadly the recording quality is very low. Musically, Zappa was in some ways his own worst enemy: as soon as he had played a riff once, he was bored with it, so he moved on to another musical theme, to the frustration of much of the audience.If you want a great Zappa live recording of around the same period, without the blatant sexual humour, but with Captain Beefheart and some outstanding rock music, and much better recorded too, buy BONGO FURY."
4,Big Fun Pt.2,"As one of the closing shows at the Fillmore East, musically this album ranks as one of the best, and certainly one of the tightest in the Zappa repetoire.Some may be put off by the onstage antics of ""Flo & Eddie"", and I agree, they're given a little too much play on this album, but it's still a lot of fun, and the second side is the killer. A maniacally over-the-top version of ""Peaches En Regalia"" combined with a juiced-up ""Tears Began To Fall"", preluded by a hilarious send-up of the groupie-laden early seventies.Worth buying for musicianship if nothing else."
3,Perhaps the first rock opera!,Not for children.This Frank Zappa driven Mothers live concert is the funny story of a well known pop rock band of the 1960's traveling to their next gig. On one of the stop overs groupies begin to tantalize and tittilate the band members with seductive inuendo of a sexual nature. This opera is a combination or coarse language and streetwise witty repartee. The language paints some explicit pictures with hilarious references and a quirkiness that is of the time. It is best if you recognize the song that rose through the charts with a bullet that identifies the band in question.You will either love it or hate it.
4,"5 Stars for music, 4 stars for fun","This cd has one incredible track that will stand the test of time, and that is LATEX SOLAR BEEF. some really impressive keys from Don Preston. If you really enjoy a bit of humor in your music, this cd will most definently serve itself up for many helpings.music is good, the humor sorta overshadows it."
1,WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!,Listen people...... Anyone who knows this Album from the days of vinyl will recognize after listening to the first track that you have been ripped off!!!!! LITERALLY. The vinyl tracks flowed but the CD has been hacked.......parts left out from each and every track. Each track has been chopped off in the beginning of the track and again at the end. What a tragedy! Zappa will probably haunt the fools responsible for not preserving this piece in its entirety. A big dissapointment.
3,Shut up and Play your guitar?,"Funny, irreverent, and sadistic at times, Zappa's Mother's are onstage and perhaps a little too into theater for my tastes. While I'm not a huge Zappa fan, and perhaps enjoying irreverent theater as music is one of the requirements - I've long admired and enjoyed Zappa guitar playing. His effortless noodling is what I buy his records for. I have a hard time passing up a live session, and so, this one enters the foray - my take, NOT enough noodling.Without reading the historical background of what this band (this newly constructed Mother's) was made up of, you'd wonder what the Turtle's song is doing there, as did I, and you'd no doubt be a bit struck with all the obsession with fan-based, star-obsessed hilarity.No matter."
2,Imagine me and you.,Most of this live album is devoted to cringe-inducing material about groupies. But the material performed during the encore is pretty good.
1,A masterpiece...if you're 15 years old,"Hey, I'm sorry he's dead, but Frank Zappa had all the sense of humor of people writing on toilet walls. It's funny if you're male and just hitting puberty; if you still find it funny 20 years or even 2 years later, your development has arrested. This album is first among equals in Zappa's ""humor"" output for the most unfunny groupie jokes and the least effective use of his band's talents...or his own. During his life, Zappa crowed constantly about how stupid people were overall and maybe he had a point; a large number of people bought this and his other albums and they continue to do so today. P.T. Barnum would've been proud."
5,A True Classic,"When I first heard this in 1973, I could not believe it. It is truly a ground breaking live recording. By today's standards, the mudshark isn't much, but at the time, it was revolutionary. Any one who likes to challenge themselves, feels like a revolutionary must have this CD."
5,The Marriage of Figaro,"This album is rock burlesque, Francis Vincent Zappa style. Move over Amadeus. A bizzare and crude yet classic view into the 20th century through the Maestros eye. Salieris descriptions of Mozart are brought to mind. Vital with energy. I truly love the Little House intro. Somebody explain to me how one man in one life could compose and perform such diverse works like Fillmore East, Burnt Weeny Sandwich, Uncle Meat, Bongo Fury, Were only in it for the Money, Hot Rats, Waka Jawaka, One Size, Cruisn with Ruben, Tinseltown, Zoot Allures, Roxy, etc, etc."
3,On CD-R? Really?,"Manufactured on demand on CD-R? Man, the Zappa family is really hitting a new low. As a fanatic fan since the late 60's I've found the increasing greed of the Zappa Family Trust a bit appalling with their ridiculously high prices and insane shipping rates. I've continued to buy their CD's but it's getting harder and harder to swallow. Now, manufacturing to a CD-R which has so little cost/overhead it seems they're just being lazy pigs. What's next, photocopying the artwork? Jeez...It breaks my heart to say this but Gail, you've become a pig..."
3,Where's the Bandit????,"I love the Live at Filmore album. You have to be a Zappa junkie to love his music, and I am.What totally disappoints me is that when the vinyl went to CD they removed the Illinois Enema Bandit. Okay, I'll grant you it's a take off on a real life situation, but it's also the best blues rif I've ever heard on a Zappa album.I've combed everything from Amazon, I-tunes, Sony, music stores, etc... and there just isn't a CD after take of the Live at Filmore that includes this song. What a cheat!!!!!!!If anyone finds a CD version that includes the Illinois Enema Bandit flag me... I'll be buying."
2,Not Frank at his best,"I think that the positive reviews of this album have more to do with the happy memories it brings some of the reviewers than its actual musical content. Listened to today, the humor is heavy-handed and unfunny, the skits are annoying, and Flo and Eddie are unbearably irritating, whether they're singing or attempting to make jokes with a very snide and unpleasant Zappa. A self-satisfied, smug feeling of ""Aren't we so clever, making fun of pop music!"" permeates this disc. It's mean-spirited, snide and unfunny. I like a lot of Frank's work, and when he was at his best he could be very funny. This isn't his best work. Most unforgivably, the Mothers sound very tame and rote, with valuable playing time surrendered to the tiresome Flo and Eddie, whose appeal eternally escapes me. I gave this a chance long ago and it hasn't grown on me since. Give this a pass and get one of Frank's classics instead, like ""Hot Rats"" or ""Apostrophe."""
4,Inspiring images for students of trompe l'oeil.,As a student of trompe l'oeil I purchased this book hoping to get new ideas and inspiring images. This book provides just that. I had to order two more copies for my art teacher and her assistant. The photographs alone makes the book worth ordering.
4,Multiple Uses,"I have been reloading ammunition, and having difficulty cleaning the primer pockets. After trying a dozen different tools, I decided to try the Dremel with a polishing brush. Perfect! The pockets are clean quickly, with little effort, and without scratching or removing brass from the pocket. My only complaint is that the brush wears away fairly quickly (say a new brush every 500 rounds or so."
4,BETTER SEPARATELY,"To my opinion ""Desperado"" is the best entry in the trilogy. It's very stylish and romantic. Many people consider ""El Mariachi"" to be the best and I won't argue although I don't like the first film. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" consists of many first-rate stars and therefore is interesting to watch but it lacks the freshness and novelty of the previous both. As I think the whole trilogy sticks to ""Desperado"", this film is like a magnet that attracts the other two.But that's a question - to buy or not to buy? I wouldn't. Of course the price of the trilogy is impressive but there practically are no bonus features here. I'd rather purchase all three separately. On the other hand all those trilogy boxes look very good. So if you're a really crazy fan of Robert Rodriguez I think you'll prefer to by both the trilogy box and all three editions separately.4 1/2 for the movies and 3 for the edition."
4,Gruesome film about real death on camera,"I have to say the first time I viewed this documentary it made me very uneasy. It is the only film I know that actually shows real death by killing on film. The main story though is about the director trying to discover if their is a real snuff film instead of various people catching killings on camera. This film is the best one about death, it blows Faces of Death out of the water and any other fake death films. This one has all real and quite disturbing deaths on camera."
4,"Great replacement for my 25"" tv","I went from an old non stereo, 25"" to this 27"" model.Stereo works well, and also will automatically turn on the closed captioning when you mute the volume.S video conenction, regular coax (""cable tv"") and 1 set of RCA jacks, but no audio output.This is a ""generic"" Panasonic, so it has the same black picture tube as the much more expensive Panasonics, but fewer bells and whistles overall.One of the biggest selling points to me was that the screen is MUCH flatter than anything else in this price range. All the other stereo tvs at this price looked like fishbowls. In fact, even on its own, it is a relatively flat screen, which makes a big difference.The comb filter seems to have made a huge difference in picture sharpness over my old tv."
3,Quasar - Limited feature Panasonic,This is my second Quasar TV. I still have the first which is working great after 10 years. Quasar is made by Panasonic and uses the same plants and parts. It just has limited features and no advertising. If you don't need PIP and multiple A/V connections this TV is worth the price.
4,great entry level tv with upgraded connections,"This is a great TV for the price. Most tvs with S video cost more. The screen is flatter than almost all tvs at the same price, which is a bonus. Great DVD picture when using the S video.Great black/white seperation. Comes with timer and the ability to label channels with text.it fits in the same space that my old 25"" tv used to sit."
1,It died after 10 months,Title says it all. No more video. Can't even find their web site on the internet.
3,staples,staples shoud have stated coating zinc orgalv. Also a less expensive form of shipping and better packaging needs to be used
2,description does not state size!,"I am disappointed in the size of these bowls. They are very small...the largest being approx 1.5 qt. The description does not state the size and I needed much larger. They do seem to be made very well, though."
3,Zak Multi-Color Mixing Bowls,Over all the bowls are nice. The only thing that disappointed me was that they looked a lot bigger on line. They come in handy for small mixes.
3,Much smaller than expected...,"These bowls are advertised as being ""mixing bowls."" I was surprised when they arrived in the mail, as the box was tiny! They are much too small to actually be mixing bowls. They're a great set of bowls, but are really prep bowls, as they are quite small."
1,Too dry plaster rolls,"This was our third cast for the third child. Only 1 of 5 plaster rolls was proper in terms of the consistency it became after being soaked in water. The other four remained hard and crumbly, even after soaking individual pieces for 15 minutes (the good roll became right as soon as it hit the water). We were unable to get a good cast out of this kit. We got one good layer with the good roll, and our attempt at a second layer resulted in a falling apart mess. SO Diapppointing!"
1,absent purchase,"funny thing. i never got this package. i am still waiting. i ordered it in july and it has not arrived yet. i would appreciate it if you could find it for me. people have told me that amazon.com is slow, so i've been patient. still nothing.thank you.victoria garnett"
4,Great Product!,"My husband and I enjoyed casting my splendid belly as a memorable keepsake of a very joyous time. This was a very easy to use, effective product that was fairly priced and took very little time to cast. I would do it all over again!"
5,Messy but I loved it!......,"I purchased this because its my very first pregnancy and I thought it would be cool just in case it's my only. It is very easy to use, especially by yourself. It says do-it-yourself but then talks about a helper so I was a little nervous. As long as you follow the directions it's cool, even if the casting (after getting wet) sticks to itself it's very easy to straighten out again. The only problem I had was the plaster kept getting everywhere (thank God for the plastic protector). If you are doing this by yourself make sure you have everything laid out and properly prepared because even though I did, it was drying way too fast (when it dries it starts to come off) and I was rushing to get it done properly. Another thing I loved about this product is they give you enough of everything so it is meant for women of all sizes. I happen to be small so I have about a little less than half of my kit left. If I get pregnant again I will without a doubt purchase this."
3,NOT WORTH MORE THAN 10 BUCKS....,"This is a nice tool but honestly do not think it is worth MORE THAN 10 bucks. Even at 10 inches, the shank is really small for my large hands. Made in China like most everything, I think you could go to Home Depot and get one at almost twice the size for about the 16-17 range. The small size and cost factor gives this a 3 Star only. I was mildly disappointed."
5,Tool belt necessity,"The Shark bar is a part of my tool belt on a daily basis. The Shark prybar is useful all types of work; from removing delicate trim in old homes to cabinet construction and installation. The most important feature is quality. There are several ""copy cat"" prybars that cannot compare to the Shark products. I have used the tool for many years and it has never failed or been deformed in any way. The thin, wide blade allows it to be slipped into the tightest of joints with little or no damage to the wood. I would recommend acquiring 8"" and 10"" models. One for the tool belt and the other for the tool bag when extra leverage is needed."
5,Pulls Nails Like Nothing Else,"I have been repairing my home from Hurricane Ike damage. This works far better than a Wonderbar at pulling nails without damaging the material or needing a block for prying longer nails. It is lightweight, yet has a lot of leverage. A great time saver and something that has replaced what I thought was an indispensable tool."
2,Sad but wiser,"I just purchased ""Bridge Buff 19 and Visual Deal 7.0. While visually it is pretty, I did not find it worth the money.I am getting back into playing bridge and would be considered an average/above average player but wanted to practice playing to improve my skills. Unfortunately, I found this program made fundamental playing errors and incorrect bids.The postmortem (option that shows the possible bids a set of hands can make)to be wrong also. A laydown slam bid did not show as even possible. The bidding Kibitzer (shows what a bid means)was wrong many times.My advice is do not buy this program."
3,Get it from the library,"I used a few of the numbers to get samples and coupons but, I could've saved my money. You can, don't buy it."
2,It isn't the show but . . .,They really should consider putting the show on DVD. The show was and is creative and innovative.
2,Wasted Tape,"The P-touch is capable of making labels, however, it's extremely frustrating to continue buying expensive tape for this label-maker, only to have to cut an inch of tape each time I print a label. I called the manufacturer in the hopes that I didn't set the machine properly but had an extremely frustrating conversation with their ""customer service"" representative who explained (not so patiently) that it is not a design flaw. The manufacturer intended for the machine to create an inch of lead in tape each time you print out a label. She acknowledged that they log calls EVERY day complaining about the wasted tape but insists they cannot do anything about it. Given the low cost of the machine, the real money-maker is in the cost of the tape itself so cutting off an inch of tape each time you use the machine tends to add up in wasted money. If I had known about this problem earlier, I would not have bought this machine."
3,It works well,my complaint is the cost of the Tz tapes and the amount of tape it waste on each print. I've gotten to the point I setup multiple labels to print all at once and then cut into individual labels. It would be nice to have an AC adapter for the unit included with the labeler and smaller font for 3 line printing but the print is excellent and there are enough options in the fonts and layouts. I rated it a 3 because of the amount of wasted tape and the cost of the tape itself. (Can you say OEM? :D)
1,PT Labeler should be named: TAPE (MONEY) WASTER,"Glad to see it seems to be as important to most of the other purchasers of this product as it is to me about the amount of tape wasted when using this machine. Imagine my ire when reaching the end of the role to see 4 more long inches wasted at the end because of dark bars pre printed from top to bottom of the tape (for 4 inches)! This is absolutely absurd. Yes, the manufacturer can help it, if they wanted to. We should all pack our labelers in ""postage to be paid by addressee"" marked packages and let them figure out what they can do to get back in our good grace. I'll bet it would happen pretty good and fast, too."
2,"Don't drop it---extremely fragile, not fixable","I've had two of the Brother P-touch Labeling System machines, and, being human, I have dropped one on the hardwood floor in the dining room, and the other fell off the arm of my recliner onto the hardwood floor in our living room, when my cat jumped up and knocked it off. These labeling machines are NOT made to withstand ANY shock of ANY kind. My husband and I tried to re-align whatever ""parts"" were in the machine to enable the tape to print out again, and we could fix NEITHER machine. Get the most utterly simple machine they make, and DON'T DROP IT."
