2,big DM fan. But what happen to dave's voice??,"i saw them live in l.a. at the exciter tour, and they sounded excellent. the dave that sang in paris in this video stinks. the only highlight is when martin gore sings and on the 2nd cd. martin gore does an accoustic version of sister of night. i honestly would recommend you getting the DM Devotional DVD. dave and the gang all sing great there.."
5,"Dave is a hot sweaty damn good performer, and I'm straight","FIVE STARS...SIX IS MORE LIKE IT. I am a picky bastard, and my bride is even more brutal. That said, we do not own a better DVD than ""One Night in Paris"". Every time we put it in the DVD player, I get lucky. Forget all the ""Dave sings flat"" blah blah blah that some claim. That's cockamayme blowhardiness from people who want to hear ""New Life"" over and over on their Casio portable tape players. Dave gives the rarest of performances that gives Jim Morrison and Elvis a run for their money (and thankfully he isn't drugged out and rail thin like in Devotional). I saw them in Boston, and it was the best concert of the 40 concerts I have been to in my life. If you want something more than pop-fizz ""People Are People"" and ""Master and Servant"" this DVD sets the standard thanks to Dave's stage presence, Martin's song writing ability, and Andrew Corbin's direction. SIX STARS."
4,Really Grew On Me,This is one of the few concert videos that I can watch over and over. At first I felt like something is missing but it really grew on me. There are some great songs on here.
5,A must have for depeche fans,After growing up with this ban since their inception.They have reached new and unchartered heights in the music industry.This dvd show's that they have shed their purely synthsound and became a full sounding rock experience.They cover old favorites and ad new twists to new ones.How cool is it to see Martin Gore play a guitar.The photography/lighting is simply spectacular.Enough said! GO BUY THIS DVD NOW!
2,Disappointment,"The DVD did not live up to expectations. I thought Dave's voice sounded REALLY bad. When I saw DM in concert this tour, I didn't really notice Dave not hitting the notes, but it's glaringly apparent here. Sometimes it's to the point of cringing. I know Dave has been slightly off key ever since the Violator tour, but I never noticed it this much until the DVD. Ouch.I also take exception to the setlist. For instance, I thought ""Clean"" was the highlight of the show when I saw them. But here, it was replaced with ""Condemnation,"" quite possibly the WORST DM concert song - at least one where, every time I've heard it played, half the crowd goes to the restroom or buys another beer. Why do they keep playing it? I also don't understand why ""I Feel Loved"" didn't make the cut. They played it at the show I was at.Anyway, if you want a good performance, buy '101.' Good music, better songs, better vocals."
4,DM delivers,"This wasn't by far the best concert film I have ever seen, but it was one of the best concerts.Not the best film because of the sound quality, which I felt could have been much better and the editing and camera angles.One of the best concerts because of Depeche Mode's performances, their wide range of hits. Can't really go wrong there.The dvd itself is another story. The bonus items and added features make this entirely worthwhile for DM fans. It's reasonably priced for a two-disc set and well packaged.Fans won't be disappointed."
1,They look depressed,I've never seen a band look more depressed than Martin and Dave onstage during this show. I swear at times it looks like Martin is EMBARASSED to be there. The audience rarely participated in the songs. The set list is boring. Dave looks like he's impersonating his own moves from the Devotional tour. He's off-key in the worst way. The set looks like it was put together in five minutes. What a sad tour.
3,Not their best,"This performance does not match the brilliant Devotional, or even the choppy 101. This is DM in the post-Alan era, Dave has cleaned up and the show is stripped down to the bone (heh). Dave is not in the best voice, and the show lacks the excitement and drama of Devotional.I love DM, just want to turn the clock back to 1993."
2,"For real, what happened? :(","Ever since Alan left, DM seemed to just have gone down hill. He was an under appreciation that added so much to the group. Seems like he took a part of Dave's voice with him too :/What happened ........?"
5,Depeche mode Forever!,"I have not seen this DVD but I attended the show in Paris therefore I already know it is a 5+. I have been a huge Depeche Mode fan since I was about eleven years old and have gone to all of the shows in Denver since then. I have a friend in France who shares my love for the band and he bought me two tickets to the show in Paris, so my friend and I took a two week European vacation and finished the trip with the mode show the night before our flight home. What a way to end an awesome trip. The fact that the stadium was literally packed full of Depeche Mode fans from all over the world felt so awesome, everyone singing along, that is definately an experience that I will never forget. Although I had seen the mode several times at home, the energy that they put out for this show was amazing. The vibe of the whole place was inexplicable. My new goal is to see Depeche Mode in Europe each time they tour, so I hope they tour soon because I need another vacation!"
3,"Good, bad and ugly","Hey, I love a cocaine driven performance just as much as the next guy, but I expect the lead singer to sing, not stumble through pieces of a song between struting around like a peacock without feathers."
4,A Truly Great Show,"I don't know why everyone is crabbing about Dave's voice. No, he's not going to sound exactly like he does on the albums nor is he going to sound, at age 39, like he did when he was 26. If people out there want perfection, then they should just sit home and listen to the albums instead of going to the shows. That's the great thing about live concerts. There's this raw energy and it's not always perfect, but Dave is an excellent performer. He gives off so much passion and he was really into the audience. The music sounds great and you can tell the band was having a good time. The stage production is really cool with great visuals. The special features are pretty cool, also. I personally love this concert. As soon as I finished watching it, I put it on again. It's worth buying."
3,Good for a one time viewing,"The camera shots and sound quality were good. I enjoyed the songs that the band performed. However, there were many other songs that I would have liked to have heard them play. I am curious as to who chose the set that the band played on this DVD. Overall, I would say that the show was entertaining. It makes me want to check out other live performances of theirs.I give it three and a half stars."
3,Good but not the best!,"I really was looking for a DM video that captured the experience of the excitement from the last few tours I had the opportunity to see. Unfortunatly, I felt like this video was more of a really long live music video and did not serve the ""live concert"" forum like I'm used to. Several of their great hits are included but the sound was muted and part of the ""live"" music experience is to be able to feel the energy of the crowd and hear them particiate as dedicated fans. This is practically muted in this DVD. I may watch it again, but it doesn't bring back the awsome experience I was hoping for."
2,Dull,"With the exception of a few (literally) tracks, this is an exceptionally dull and monotoneous set. Unless you are a big Plump DJ's fan, I'd give this one a miss.2/5 stars"
4,Nice grooves,Very good album. This was very original and surprisingly so. This album is filled with energetic grooves that won't disappoint.
3,Based on the photo...,"It's hard to tell the quality of this wig, but it looks OK for a beginner cosplayer or a costumer who can't afford to obtain the more costly custom versions from online wig stylists. This wig would certainly work in a pinch! By the way, most cosplayers make their own accessories and frankly do NOT want things like odango sheilds permanently attached to their wigs. (I happen to make odango for Sailor Moon wigs so I'm speaking from firsthand experience.) That way, they have the option of dressing as Sailor Moon or the schoolgirl Usagi."
1,Gag,Hey kids! Let's pay 60 bucks for something that can be obtained by dying your hair and putting meatballs in it! ;)
3,Very Minor Update,"This edition of Photoshop Elements 4 Solutions is a disappointment. It is basically the same book as the Elements 3 book without the Mac information. There is little new. Even some new features of 4 are not covered at all such as ""Defringe"" even though it is mentioned on the back cover. If you have the 3 edition do not waste your money on this one."
3,Where's the Mac (version)??,"Aaland is an excellent writer, since he simplifies somewhat complicated procedures and gives specific examples the reader can try with his own program and computer, and in the process learn how to deal with similar problems with his/her own photos. However, there are differences between the PC and the Mac versions of PSE 4, and (especially for beginning image editors) confusion of terms (or missing terms - for the Mac) will not prove helpful. Michael - how about the Mac version of the book??? Why stop with #3? Bainbridge did the same thing with her ""Missing Manual"". The Mac is still the platform of choice for creative and scientific work, and the numbers are increasing. Where's the beef (book) for Mac users??"
2,Watch your fingers!,"I recently purchased a Soyabella. I don't know what the designers of the product were thinking! Although it made good soymilk the design prevents you from cleaning the machine properly. THe milk container and the element and the plugin are all one piece!!! But not to worry if you get water in the plug in area and it won't work just wait three or four days and it may recover! Not good for someone who drinks soy milk or raw almond milk every day.THe blade is so razor sharp it is very likely you will be injured while attempting to get the thing clean anyway. More thought should be put into this- otherwise great concept- of a machine. I also have an SoyQuick Soy Milk Maker (SDZ-5) , and though it doesn't make soups, like Soyabella advertises and what I found fascinating about the Soyabella, I like the soy quick much better."
2,Could have been more,"I found it disappointing. The book was much smaller in scope than the other books in the trilogy, focusing only on the end of Bester's life. There could have been much more to it. Much more interesting periods to cover. I liked the way that the book tried to examine all aspects of the character's personality, but I thought that the plot just didn't move very much. It was a wasted opportunity to tie up more loose ends."
3,"Good, but not what was promised","By far, my biggest disappointment -- and that from something (presumably) out of the control of the author himself -- was that the back cover made references to the Telepath War and Sheridan, neither of which were issues in this book! When the time frame became obvious in the first chapter, I immediately had to stop where I was and skim the rest of the book for some indication of a flashback or something to tie in the information I was expecting! After realizing it was not to be, I enjoyed the story for what it was, although with a lingering disappointment for what it was not."
3,Could have been better.,"This book was interesting. Others have already sung their praise so now I will critize. The authur built Bester's character excently but sinfully tranform Garbaldi into a one-dimensial, homicicadal, jerk. The last comfromtaion should have been one of dialog where Garbaldi would have to face his demons for betraying Sherdain. According to the series, bester merly enhanced Garbaldis suspicious mind, so Garbaldi was still in controll. All the book left us with, though, was a cheap shotem up. What a waste of an excenlent trilogy and an excellent book."
4,Best in the Trilogy,This book was the most enjoyable of the three novels encompassing the Psi Corp trilogy. What I likes most about it was this intimate glimpse into the life of Bester in his older years-- and seeing him (almost) give in to a human weakness. I also thought the author did a wonderful job of ending Bester's story and bringing the trilogy full circle. A very quick read but fun nonetheless.
3,Disappointing,"I would have liked the book more if I had not had such great expectations of it - that it would go through the Telepath War, explain what happened to Lyta, etc. Reading JMS's comments in mags and the Lurker's Guide certainly gave me the impression that these topics would be covered in the Psi Corps trilogy. I am excited about the upcoming Centauri Prime books, but I'm afraid it would look something like this: 1) Londo's childhood; 2) Londo's decision to go to Babylon 5; 3) After Londo is made Emperor, he has some affairs, travels to Paris, writes some book critiques. I know, I know, the excerpt in the back of The Final Reckoning would appear to suggest the content of the books might actually answer some unanswered questions, but so did the back page of The Final Reckoning! Overall, I'd have to say that Keyes writes well, the dialogue seemed very true to character, and the book flowed well. But, I was hoping for more answers to questions raised in Babylon 5 and Crusade."
4,Somewhat of a disappointment,"I think that many B5 fans were eagerly anticipating this book with the hopes of learning more about the Telepath War. If that is your sole reason for purchasing this book, save your money! While it does answer some interesting questions as to what transpired within the B5 universe it seemed awfully anticlimactic for what could have a been a very gripping final confrontation between two of the key characters. If nothing else it definitely begs the question now--what happened during the Telepath War????????"
2,"Well, okay, I guess.","The first two books in this trilogy had more of the Babylon 5 feel I've come to know. This book fell pretty flat. Bester from the show (and the first two books) is truly a more complex person then the one presented here. In the other two books, I could hear Garibaldi speak his lines. In this book, not really. With almost all elements of the B5 universe missing, this book could have been about anyone, anywhere. Plus, unless sleeper drugs have improved (of which improvements are not mentioned in the books from what I saw), they take hours to kick in."
3,"ok as a stand alone, but does not add to the arc","This was a good stand alone book, as an examination of a psychopath(Bester) and his human qualities. However, it reveals very little about the telepath war, and Bester falling in love with a 'normal' was unconvincing. Also, Besters punishment of simple imprisonment seemed very lenient for a war criminial. A mindwipe, new personality, and service to the society he harmed so greatly seems more appropriate. A decent book but not anywhere the level of ""In the Beginning"" or ""To Dream in the City of Sorrows""."
2,Disappointing Conclusion,"I felt that this book was a somewhat disappointing conclusion to the series. The book left a lot of questions unanswered. Also, I thought that the book contained a serious flaw in its plot."
3,Better than the other two Bester books,"I got a better feel for the Bester character from this book and when he met his final fate in this book, it seemed to make sense for me. No, it does not tie up all the Psi-Corps loose ends from the series, but it does a halfway decent job at fleshing out the character of Bester. Trouble is, if you haven't read the first two books in the trilogy, it's not going to make a whole lot of sense to you to read this all on its own.I'm a hard grader when it comes to the B5 books, pretty much all the rest of them rate only one or two stars with me."
3,book,this book was in worst shape than advertised. it was listed as good but I would rank it fair at best
4,good,"good information inside and very helpfull, i heared that the previous edition is better, but i get this because amazon doesn t provide the other."
3,Update please,"This book, as would be expected from Haynes, has a lot of very good information and advise about how to work on the Classic Beetle. It is very accurate and has helped me through some jobs that I defiantly could not have done without it. However, the book needs to be updated. New tools are available that make a lot of jobs easier and more simple. In all reality about 25% of the book is useless because they haven't updated it to reflect current technology and tools."
2,Poor Paper Quality,"THe book is comprehensive but unfortunately the quality of the paper it has been printed on is disappointing. It seems like the lowest quality newsprint type paper was used. For a workshop manual this is impractical and will shorten the useful life of the book - in workshop conditions a manual such as this is subject to exposure to moisture, oils and greases etc and therefore the paper should be of a good standard. It would have been good to have some colour pictures - this would make the technical narrative easier to follow. It would have been better if the cover was a hard cover - for the reasons above."
3,competent manual,"Over the last ten years or so Haynes manuals have steadily gotten more and more generic and unfortunately useless, with that comment in mind this particular manual on the beetle scores as above average. It still has a few weak areas but the other reviewers covered them well enough."
2,took a long time getting here,"It was almost a month, with back and forth correspondence, before I finally received my book."
5,Beautiful,This song is most of all beautiful! I just love the melody and those words really make you feel good. For you are not alone!!! Michael is the greatest :)
5,meaningful,"This song reminds me that when we can't be with the ones we love its okay, they are in your heart and always will be. Its really sweet!"
5,Michael Jackson is still a legend in his own time.,"No matter what anyone says, this man has come a long way from the Jackson Five that we once knew.His music has deep meaning that gives hope to all, especially the song, ""You are not Alone.""He is letting us know that no matter what happens, no matter how hard times are getting, we are not alone. There will always be someone who is there for us. Even when it seems like no one cares."
2,INCREDIBLE SONG WHICH MOBILISED MY PASSION!!!,I am a music fan anyway but i've never been carried away in the field of music as i was with this CD.I actually heard this cd in a party!Then i developed passion feelings within me that I'M NOT ALONE IN ANYCASE. This guy is the hell of a nice guy anyway but this wasn't the reason why i was carried away but i was carried away with his mode of dancing and shortly this CD is THE FOUNTAIN OF EXCELLENCE!!!CUS ITS SUPER. DAVETOP ONAMADE.FROM LAGOSIANS CITY OF NIGERIA.
5,the CORRECT track listing,this is a great single/e.p. but amazon has the wrong track listing.the correct one is :album edit(4.54)radio edit (4.29)franctified club mix (10.40)scream louder - flyte time remix (5.30)mj megaremix (10.35)
4,NOT AS GOOD AS STRANGER IN MOSCOW,"Only one problem with this song... Michael did not write it... that makes me sad, I love HIS songs."
2,No book...no rating,This book was never recieved....how can I rate it. There has been no response from Amazon or from the suppling book seller when I responded to first customer satisfaction inquiry by Amazon.com
4,scream at the top of your lungs,michael jackson remixes are always at best. 2 birds in 1 stone having 2 big stars in the form of siblings michael and janet in one great cd. the remixes are great especially the 9 minute morales explicit mix of scream which is rare and controversial.
3,"Got what I wanted, but...","They sold me a CD labeled as `new' but it was actually a used CD with resealed plastic wrapping. Also, the disc looked like it was burned on a home machine. I got the music I wanted, but it felt shady. I would be reluctant to purchase from them in the future."
1,dremel model 300-1/41H review,I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE @ A HOME DEPOT STORE.The hi speed rotary tool is comfortable to handle.The variable speed motor is easily adjustable with a slider switch.The tool kit included is a good selection of pieces.The tool I got had a defect right out of the box.I discovered that the tool has a wobble in the shaft. with a 2 inchlong tool inserted in the chuck it is quite noticeable. I returned to the store and checked out 2 more [new in the box] and they all had this defect. At 35000 rpm top speed this could be hazardous to use. Be aware that this defect may be found in other units.
3,A waste for me...,"I liked the price of this unit. But even after repeated calls to Belkin support, I could not get the router to work consistently with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. I put it outside the DMZ, turned off the firewall, downloaded the current firmware and everything else the tech from Belkin offered. I even double checked my ISP to make sure the issue was not on that end.I purchased a netgear router and have been golden ever since."
1,Sold as NEW - Received as USED,"This router was received as previously used, therefore had been setup and assigned a password. This was sold by Amazon (not by a third party vendor). Amazon should be more aware of items returned - then sold as new. No problem getting the credit - but no more in stock so had to find another router in a hurry elsewhere."
1,Constant disconnects,"I've owned this router for about 2 years now. It worked correctly for about 3 months, then immediately started having tremendous problems with any packet data being sent from PCs on my network. I constantly have disconnects while gaming, MMO, and no firmware upgrades or settings can be changed to resolve.DO NOT BUY."
1,nothing but trouble,"We had nothing but trouble with this router. We kept getting kicked off the internet when we were using this router and had to spend hours talking with tech support. We also couldn't hardly understand the people at tech support because they are from another country and didn't speak English very well. After having it only two months, it finally quit working completely and we have to buy another router."
4,"Easy setup, works great.",Easiest wireless router setup that I've come across. Works great and has a very good range. I get a very good signal at the opposite side of my house and on the floor above the router. I highly recommend this router.
1,"If you want to spend 1hr and 55 min on the phone with tech support, then buy it now!","Something that was supossed to be a pleasant experience took almost 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back in 2 different calls.Some one at Circuit city recomended it to me and I fell for that. I am returning this item. The set up wasn't that difficult. The problems began when I wanted to set up the security features. After that it wouldn't connect. I had to make 2 different calls and spent a lot of time on the phone. The issue was fixed after having to do lots of changes in my computer, going to different web sites and downloading updates.Even though the problem was fixed, I jsut don't want to go trough the same process if the problem re appear."
4,"Nothing special, but it works.","I recently purchased one of these to replace my now dead Linksys router. At first I was losing connection every minute or so; I contacted customer support twice, which was in itself a horrid nightmare (as with any other company). I eventually called my ISP and I was told there was something wrong with my line, and after that conversation with them, I haven't had any disconnection problems since.There's nothing really wrong with this router; in fact, I like it...to some degree."
1,Drops connection after a couple of hours,The router that I purchased was unable to keeps it PPPOE connection for more that a couple of hours. Now I have to constantly reboot the router to reestablish a connection.
1,Completely without Value,"This router drops my connection every few minutes. I've spent hours on the phone with Belkin and replaced the whole thing. A quick internet search finds dozens of people reporting the same problem, with no solution offered.It's just no good."
2,Randomly drops connection,"I also have the problem of random disconnects. We had a techie come in and try to set it up for us, he got it working, but the thing still randomly boots us off. It does the job, I guess, of giving us a connection, but it's got almost no reliability. I hear it's got a lifetime warranty; good, we can return it."
1,Another dissatisfied customer.,"Not only was this difficult to set up (even a generally polite but sadly ill-informed technical helper from Belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases) but once I finally managed to get it to work (by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip) it had practically no range whatsoever; in fact, my MacBook Pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75% signal, and once the threshold of the room was crossed, the signal disappeared altogether. A free four-year old Linksys router which I received with my Earthlink ""home networking"" package (and which this Belkin was supposed to replace) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed, and Linksys is supposed to be notoriously Mac-unfriendly. Anyway, I hope that there are enough UPS trucks in America to handle the returns that this item -- mine included -- will require."
5,Fantastic,"Even if you know well this chapter of the Middle East history, the way it is written will keep you paste to the book. Very good job."
5,A tripple PHD in the history of this war,"An exceptional book.First book depicting multiple angles of the conflict.Covers the war from the perspective of soldiers, generals and politicians.Allows reader to understand the complex scenario general Elazar had to deal withWould have loved to see a second edition with more coverage of the Egyptian side and new information from the Israeli archives opened after 30 years."
4,Stuck with tradition,I have been using Norton Antivirus forever and am reluctant to move on although I've read reviews of other products that put Norton in the middle of the pack.
1,"Norton - I've used their products since the 70's, not anymore","Norton is now owned by the huge behemouth Digital River, who haven't a clue how to run support or customer service. They are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it, wouldn't consider it. Norton used to be top notch, now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer. It interferes with everything. Microsoft seems to have given up on them too, as Norton has not bothered to interface properly with Windows, a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic. I can only warn you ~ AVOID!!! A bad bit of software and a company that hasn't any clue about what customer service is and doesn't look likely to change. Profit seems to be likely more important to them than service or keeping the Norton family of software up to date and working well..."
1,Do Not Buy It,"Had 2006 anti virus and it worked great. Had 2006 Personal Firewall and it worked great. Figured I'll try something better ""Norton Internet Security 2007"" What a waste of time and money. Scans are way slower than 2006, updates are slower, The firewall is a joke (what happened to ad blocking) I'm buying the 2006 stuff again and throwing this 2007 junk away. Read the reviews people, there is a reason it rated so low."
4,Some people can be a little harsh.... its not that bad!,I dont normally take the time to write reviews. However with how people have given this product such a bad wrap it almost stopped me making the purchase. I'm glad I did buy it in the end. I upgraded from Norton Antivirus 2006 and yes it does slow your computer down compared to not having it installed but your computer will be more vulnerable to threats by it not being there. The accumulation of these threats will also slow your computer down and probably cause more harm.Therefore if you're at all a tollerant person and can be put out by your PC's performance suffering a tad this product I think is great and a definite step up from norton 2006.
1,AVOID AVOID AVOID,Just terrible software. Often does not work - if that would be the only thing it would be enough. But it is worse than that. Bogs down your computer big time. Makes it run super slow. Horrible. Whoever has written good reviews must be shills for Norton. Avoid. Repeat. Avoid.
1,Should have read the user reviews first,"I bought this product on the strength of the Norton name, and a positive review in Business Week. I uninstalled ZoneLabs, Ad-Aware, and all Norton anti-virus. There were still NAV files after the uninstall. I had to download their Norton Software Removal tool, which also could not remove some NAV files. Everytime I re-boot, those problematic NAV files want to re-launch NAV.The NIS 2007 install was still difficult after all of that effort, and once installed NIS 2007 either freezes up my computer, or makes my internet connection so slow that it is un-usable.So, now I've uninstalled NIS 2007, still have issues with the corrupt NAV files, and will being go back to ZoneLabs and Ad-Aware."
1,Sorry I bought this,Been using Norton tools of one kind or another continuously since the days when they were actually written by Norton (early 1980s). It's hard to recognize any of the traditional Norton traits in NIS 2007. It seems more like a MS/BigBrother product -- a huge package that wants to think for you from a company content to let purchasers finish the Beta testing. When it scans you can actually watch it miss worms and trojans on your PC. The only way to report such files to Norton is to pay them about half the cost of the product for their phone time. They offer no email addresses for reporting.
1,Very intrusive.,"Very intrusive.Instead of only alerting you when there are real viruses or spy wares it constantly interrupts you with non sense pop ups saying that everything is normal on your computer or your subscription would expire in 60 days, and I find this extremely annoying and intrusive and there is no way to turn the pop ups off."
1,Trash!,"I have used Norton products for 20 years and may never buy another. This is if possible a bigger piece of trash than Systemworks 2007. It edges out Systemworks because after the install of Internet Security 2007, Liveupdate is added to the list of features that no longer work, making it impossible to get future fixes to the bugs in both products!"
1,Major install issues,"I attempted to upgrade to NIS 2007 after using NIS 2005 for quite some time. First of all, it tells you to remove Windows Defender and Spybot. Once the program was installed, it hung while trying to run liveupdate. Then after rebooting, which was almost impossible, it said liveupdate was STILL running. And CTRL-ALT-DELETE wouldn't work to see if the process was indeed running. Then, to top it off, Symantec charges $30 to talk to tech support. So I uninstalled the program and then my computer still wouldn't reboot. I will never buy another Symantec product."
1,AVOID - Only 3 non-renewable activations - then product is useless!,"I purchased Norton's Internet Security 20007 about 3 weeks ago. In that time, I had to reinstall it four times for various hardware issues (faulty harddrive and bad O/S installs). On the fourth try, the program indicated that the product couldn't be activated and to call Symantec. After waiting 40 minutes to talk to a call centre in India, the told me that they couldn't renew the activiation, and to send the disk back to Symantec for a refund.So as of now, I need to fork out more $$ for a new security product, while I awiat a refund that will arrive in God knows how many weeks. Please, learn from my experience, if decide to buy this product. After 3 activiations, your Norton's 2007 Internet Security is useless!After 10 years using Symantec products, it's time for me to look elsewhere. Thanks for reading."
1,AVOID this product,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!This fiasco of a program took 3 days of my time to get fixed and cost me more to pay a technician than it cost.I too, have successfully and faithfully used Norton products in the past. This NIS 2007 is awful. The installation and uninstallation was atrocious, it corrupted many files on my computer to the point that the computer would not even bootup correctly, required a service technician to fix it (which cost more than the product did) and I have since changed to another Antivirus program. In the meanwhile I am searching for another internet security-type program to handle everything (parental control, spyware, adware, phishing, etc.)I am disappointed with the product, disappointed with the email support service, and disgusted with the amount of time and money I had to spend on fixing my computer because I installed it in the first place.Symantec has lost my business."
1,Norton is a Virus! Destroys Computers,"This program destroyed my computer. After downloading Norton Internet Security 2007, my P4, 3.4 Ghz computer is usless. Norton's non english speaking help line, somewhere in god knows where was no help. After using Norton's online removal tools, the computer is still unusable. Norton is not responding to refund requests after over 7 hours on the phone with them. This program is a virus and Norton's sales team should be fined or Jailed for knowingly selling such a destructive product.Do not buy this product unless you are ready to reformat your hard drive and reinstall all of your programs.Shame on you Symantec. After 20 years of using Norton Products, I will never again trust them."
2,Don't Buy NIS 2007 Update Download,"I started with Norton Internet Security 2006. I had 23 days left on my subscription. I spent megabucks to buy a 2-year update subscription download. After a ridiculously complex installation process, I ended up with ""You have 23 days left on your subscription."" I tried Live Update and everything else I could think of, several times, on two different computers. No luck. I could find no place on the Symantec website to get a refund, or even to complain. A total waste of money and a lot of time. At least, thank goodness for the Norton Removal tool, which cleared everything associated with Symantec off my computer. McAfee AntiVirus installed quickly, cleanly, and simply. It even has a cleanup tool and a defragmenter. Adios, Symantec!"
3,NIS 2007 Disappointing,"I, like some of the other reviewers, failed to notice that NIS 2007 doesn't actually come with anti-spam anymore. This is surprising because 2006 had it, so I'm not at all thrilled. I also had issues installing it. My installation attempts failed until I manually uninstalled my previous version (NIS 2006). I've been in IT for a long time so it's no big deal for me, but I bet many users would find this to be a significant stumbling block and it's a pain no matter how you look at it. On the positive side, the UI comes up more quickly and is a little snappier. I haven't had any of the performance or registry issues others have mentioned."
1,Don't Do it.,"It trashed my desktop machine and still would not install. I'll be reloading windows and all my software this weekend.It ran on my tablet pc, but slowed it down to the point where the tablet was barely usable.Do not buy this product!!. Get an older version or go with another software suite."
1,Symantec is killing Norton,"I remember the days when Norton Utilities and Norton Antivirus were THE tools to have. Now? Forget it, unless you want your computer to slow to a crawl, your Internet experience slower than molasses in January, and constant reminders that ""your subscription has expired"" even though it's new and is most definitely not expired. Add to that the problems downloading upgrades, where NAV was blocking itself!No more.I'm done with Norton. Thanks, Symantec. You used to have decent products too. What happened?"
1,Poorly designed,"I have seen better textbooks. This one does not give enough examples and does not clearly explain the steps in solving problems. Unfortunately, if professors require this textbook, you're screwed...unles your prof explains everything themselves without the use of the textbook."
1,Tech problems w/DVDs?,Discs wont play; Ive tried 3 different machines. My DVD Players are each 5 to 8 yrs old but rarely do I have a title that wont play in at least one machine. Anyone else had this problem w/Spectacle S.2?
1,Apologists for genocide,"Absolute nonsense from a passle of kooks and conspiracy theorists eager to pass on propaganda from genocidal sociopaths like Slobodan Milosevic. While the reactions of the ""West"" to the events of Yugoslavia's disintegration and the aggression of Serbia on its neighbors (and Croatia on Bosnia) were hardly exemplary, it is facile at best to argue that the U.S. and/or NATO had anyhting at all to gain from ""stimulating"" war in the region. Including ""contributions"" from Milosevic to make the case for these brain-dead theories is like quoting from ""Mein Kampf"" to prove that Hitler was a peace-loving individual. Read this only if you are looking for evidence that there are still people with little enough regard for the truth and morality that they would act as apologists for some of the most evil people of recent history. This work defies all credibility and is both morally and intellectually bankrupt.(Consider the rating to be 0 stars.)"
4,The Empire is Striking Back,"The debut album for this Springfield, MA band can only mean that they are bound for greatness..Heavy but melodic, there is no reason that metal fans could go without this disc"
3,This has to be the most BORING game ever,If you like playing a game with no story then this is the game for you. The duels are pretty cool but a lot of cards are forbidden which means you can't use them. I haven't played the 2008 version but it can only get better compared to this one.
4,Come on Eileen the tops,"The other songs show that Come on Eileen was their pinnacle. The rest of the songs are pretty good, but not great in my opinion."
5,Absolutely amazing.,"Look closer at the product description: not only does this CD contain the 12 songs you can sample on Amazon, but This is What She's Like and I Love You (Listen to This), two songs I'm just crazy about and what just ecstatic to find were on the album upon receiving it in the mail. But it's so difficult to say which ones are my favorite on this CD... they're all incredible. The only one I am surprised is not on here is Burn It Down, or even just Dance Stance. With that, it truly would have been a definitive Best Of collection for me (all except for the BBC version of Let's Make This Precious... maybe it's because I'd gotten used to a live version. It just fell way short of my expectations after that, which is such a shame, because I adored that live performance.)"
3,Ripoff!!,"The product is great as you can't find it in stores. We love to use it sprinkled over white cheddar popcorn, which Target used to sell. What an incredible flavor!! BUT, the shipping charge was OUTRAGEOUS!! DON'T fall for it!!!!"
2,Refill tablet is great...I guess,"From the little bit of use we got from the refill tablet, it was great. However, the FLY pen, not so much so I can't really write a long review about this item, since the FLY broke after only using it a few times."
3,Read My Palm,"Misnomer on cover to say ""Quick & Easy"". No it's not. Lots of good information but one must put on their thinking cap and digest the images. There's a lot to learn. Plenty of visuals but this is not something you're going to pick up in an afternoon. Very detailed informtion."
5,Exposes a Different Angle to Exploring,This book is a fabulous read for those of you that are hardcore Japanophiles or for people that enjoy taking things a cut deeper when learning about a culture.It's refreshing and a quick read. I'd say it would be important to make notes in the book and possibly highlight. There are great points to which you can refer later.Do yourself the favor and get this book.iKnow
3,Good for light reading,"This is a very interesting book for those who are familiar with Japan. (This books claims to be about Asia, but most of the examples and stories are based in Japan). Actually, I've been living in Japan for over 6 years, so it's difficult for me to remember what it was like to come to Japan for the first time. By reading this book, I rediscovered some of my feelings and thoughts that I had at that time. Putting that aside, that is probably the major flaw of this book. It comes across as someone spouting off about his trip after his first time in a foreign country. There are too many generalizations and minor errors for someone who has lived in Japan. Also his overly-literal translations are just silly. If you've lived in Japan or have a lot of knowledge about Japan, you're not going to learn anything new. However, for those who are visiting Japan for the first time, this book will prepare you for your experience. It's an iteresting introduction to Japan and Japanese society."
3,East versus West?,"I think one of the editorial reviews said it best: ""readable but superficial"". T.R. Reid begins with some general observations of Asian society and his experiences living in Japan. Liberally sprinkled with some interesting statistics, the author goes on to expound on some of the cultural differences between Asian and western societies. But, I think the book fails to capture the many facets of Japan that make the place so unique. The writer starts to slow down in the middle chapters as the life and influence of Confucius is explored. He finally finishes with thoughts of individualism versus societal needs in the context of East versus West. I would suggest that readers looking for more on Japanese culture read Lost Japan by Alex Kerr which is also published by Lonely Planet Journeys."
3,Good anecdotes but overgeneralizes,"I have alwayts enjoyed T.R. Reid's NPR commentaries. I also enjoyed most of his book. Aside from the excessive explanations confucism it is a good read. Reid does overgeneralize about Asia. For example, while Tokyo is very safe, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Singapore are not (relatively). Additionally, while ""official"" divorce rates are low in Japan, there are large numbers of couples that are divorced in every sense but the legal one.Living in Japan, I am spoiled by the personal safety enjoyed being even the smallest children. I attribute it to a much more monlithic society than the U.S. and the government-fortified middle class.Don't read this as your only view of Japan but combined with some other books is makes a good supplement.For some lighter reading that also illustrates many differences between western and eastern thought also try Max Danger: Adevntures of an Expat in Tokyo"
1,Superficial generalizations and ignorant bias galore,"After seeing TR Reid speak to promote his book and wax poetic about all the insights gained on Asian culture during his stint in Japan, I am appalled to think that the general public is going to eat up his book and buy into the authority with which he writes. This is his talent no doubt, to write with such confidence about phenomena that are merely extrapolations of fairly entrenched stereotypes. His observations are semi-plausible to the uninformed, as most stereotypes and generalizations are, which is why this book likely will be such a success. TR writes and speaks well, but PLEASE disregard the content of his words."
2,A naive account of Asian success,"I was surprised to find that Reid has lived outside of the U.S. for so many years because in this book he exemplifies the American liberal mindset that characterizes all things Western (or American) as bad and all things Eastern (or foreign) as good. I can see that he has tried to give a balanced account of two cultures, but he sets up a dichotomy and lands on the Eastern side.Of course, there need not be sides, and Reid's point that Confucian values are essentially the same as Judeo-Christian values is well-taken. But his thesis is naive and weakly-argued. He consistently underrates the social advantages of homogeneity, ignores the social price of conformity, and overrates the mechanism of propoganda. To transfer Japanese methods of socal indoctrination to the U. S.(as Reid describes them) would simply not work.On the plus side, Reid offers a fascinating account of Confucianism and a few fun anecdotes."
5,A pleasure to read Reid,"Reid's prose is superlative. English teachers should show their students the writing in this book as an example of how to write in an interesting and clear way. For those of us fascinated with East Asia but unable to travel there or immerse ourselves in scholarship relating to Asia, this book is a wonderful pleasure. Some of his critics deride his thesis as overly simplistic, but this is not supposed to be an academic treatise (and thank goodness that it's not). The only section that is missing is a thoughtful appraisal of the position of women in Asian societies -- but that would require a separate book. Highly recommended."
3,enjoyable but ...,"While parts of Reid's book do provide unusual insights into ""Asian"" culture that I had not previously known, the overall writing style of the book can get a bit annoying. I also found myself getting a tad bored at times and skipping around. Still an interesting read. (lauger5.19.99)"
4,"This was mostly good,informative, and often funny.","I enjoyed this book. A lot of facts, a lot of social commentary, politics, predictions, and history. I most enjoyed the author's stories of his family's adventures and misadventures in Shibuya, Tokyo. I skimmed about ten percent of this book, because there were some things that just didn't interest me. Also it starts a little slow and boggy, but stick with it and you'll learn a lot and laugh a lot too."
3,Good service from company,We purchased this for are son. The CD player did not work. We contacted the company and they gave us information to send it back to them for repair or replacement with no problem at all. We received our replacement soon after sending in the defective unit. The replacement works just as it is supposed to. I really appreciate their kind and quick service with our problem.
2,More of a Coffee Table Book,"This is a nice book if you just want to display it in your living room. If you are a serious knitter, this is not for you. Most of the scarves are done in the garter stitch and the only things that change is the type of yarn and the amount of yarn to cast on. Nice book to receive as a gift - not worth buying"
2,Garter stitch galore but not much more...,"As a knitter, I was happy to see all the celebs who get the idea that knittting is relaxing, fun and productive. BUT the patterns are non-existent in this book. Nearly every scarf pattern was garter stitch and the only variations were the yarn used and the length- long or very long. This is not a book for serious knitters!"
1,name dropping galore,"Well, I guess there's a reason ""CELEBRITY"" is in larger typeface on the cover. This is really a silly book with not much substance. For People Magazine fans, this is probably a dream. If you're looking for a knitting book, I'd go elsewhere."
1,Nothing but Basics,"I agree with Lori Corzine-Hinkle, and I wish I had seen her review before I bought the book. It is almost all garter stitch with the only difference being the yarns and needle size. I'll see who I can give it to for Christmas..."
4,The creative urge,Celebrity Scarves by Abra Edelman is a charming testimonial to the joy and relaxing pleasure of mindless scarf knitting. It is such fun to see celebrities struggle with the creative urge and produce wearable results. This book is a great present for friends and family especially because it supports a charitable organization. I am a lifelong knitter and love that it demystifys the process and lets all know that anyone can pick up two needles and create.
1,Only for beginners...,"...the patterns in this book seem to be nothing but repeats of each other, using different yarns. If you are a beginning knitter and/or unsure of color/style combinations, you might enjoy this pattern book. Otherwise, it is probably way below your skill level. How many times can you see the same garter and stockingette scarf patterns displayed in one book?"
1,Minor Celebrity Scarves,"Ugh! What an extreme disappointment this book was! I looked forward to buying this book when I first heard it was being published. I had heard all the bad reviews regarding this book and was still curious about it anyway. I wanted to see the scarves with my own eyes. I didn't think the book was too bad when I first glanced through it. But the more I looked through the book and really looked at the scarves (and then read the annoying celebrity interviews), I realized what a waste of money it would be to keep the book. The other reviewer was right, you can go to your local yarn shop, browse the shelves for cool yarns, and then come up with something more creative than these patterns (even if you are a novice knitter). Thank goodness I bought this at a store with a return policy on books because it's going right back where I bought it from! I guess this is the book for you only if you are interested in a $25 coffee table book."
3,"Lovely photographs, very basic patterns","If you are interested in looking at celebrity photos only, and are not looking for scarf patterns, then this is the book for you. 90% of the patterns are garter stitch or knit every row. The only difference in any of the patterns is the yarn used. I rate it as 1 star for the patterns, but 4 stars for the celebrity photos and stories."
1,Save yourself time and money,"To make it short and sweet: Most of the scarves in the book are simple garter stitch in gorgeous yarn. So, save yourself time and money. Instead of buying the book, going to the yarn shop and making one of the scarves in the book, I'd suggest you just go to the yarn shop, pick out some exquisite yarn, and make your own one-of-a-kind designer scarf."
1,Don't bother!!,"If you want photos of movie stars, buy PEOPLE, it's cheaper. If you want creative scarf patterns, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Seventeen of the 25 scarves in this book are done in garter stitch (knit every row for the non-knitters). There are five scarves done in Stockinette stitch (knit one row, purl one row), one done in a rib pattern, and two that are crocheted. If you're looking for scarf patterns, there are magazines and books with more creative and unique patterns. Better yet, go to your local yarn shop and have them show you all the yarns you can use to knit a garter stitch scarf--the possibilities are endless. Spend your money on yarn, not on this book. No publisher would have published this book if these scarves were done by anyone else! I'm returning my copy thanks to Amazon's generous return policy."
1,"the paper is a RIP-OFF, the remover is wonderful","I ADORE Peel-Away stripper. It's fantastic. I reviewed it separately.Peel-Away PAPER is a giant rip-off in my opinion. Plastic wrap, or painter's masking plastic, or thin gauge wastebasket liners work better. And they're a lot cheaper."
1,No good,Not worth the money- does not help. I wanted to strip paint from brick and it it only stuck and made it worse.
4,The saga continues,"Turtledove's intriguing alternate history tapestry continues to take shape. The reader would be well advised to read the earlier books in the series despite the introductory synopsis of the prior volumes in the series. All the tried and true characters appear again, including Jake Featherston of the CSA, a home-grown facist intent on seizing power. It is staggering to realize how easily Turtledove's vision might have been our reality. I recommend this book highly."
5,"Fun book to read, leads me to more ""what-ifs""","I have read both the Worldwar series and the Great war series. The Great war series and this continuation is, in my opinion, much more entertaining. You can imagine the ""human development"" of events, and find yourself asking more what-if scenarios from this.Although, he does make the Hitler comparisons rather obvious, it does makes you begin to ask ""Just what would it take for another 'Hitler' style leader to gain power?""In another area, ""What would I do if someone executed my son(or my spouse) for no good reason?"" These are the reasons that I kept turning the page and look forward to seeing what happens to the characters in the next book."
3,Okay for a transition,"Blood & Iron is a good transition book: now that the war is won, all of the characters are moving towards WWII, with a ""Hitler"" arising. I didn't enjoy it as much as some of the other books, but it moved along. The one thing that Turtledove really needs to do is lay off the sex.The man cannot write a good sex scene. It's actually embarrassing.Other than that, I'm looking forward to the next book."
4,A Good Work,"American Empire: Blood and Iron was a good, enjoyable read. I read it without putting it down, except to sleep. The same characters you know and love from the Greatwar Series are well shown in their postwar experiences. The same excellent detail has been shown as previously.The only criticism I can offer is that it did get a little predictable and the ""Xena-type"" females get a little tiresome after awhile.The struggle of Morrell and other patriotic military men under a socialist regime to struggle on and to defend the nation with a shrinking budget is reminiscent of our own military's struggle today. Overall an excellent work!"
3,Skipping entire paragraphs is possible...,"I really enjoy Turtledove's recasting of history, with its actual actors in different roles and the minor characters that he creates. The problem is that he insists on telling us details about minor characters over and over again. This is problematic, because sometimes the characters do have something interesting to say or something interesting happens to them, but not often. If someone you know only passingly told you they don't like anchovies, I am pretty sure you'd get it around the sixth or seventh time. I had to skip entire paragraphs that were, ""Remember, this person doesn't like anchovies"". I am sure if I missed an anchovy moment in this book it will be picked up in the next one."
3,Turtledove's Best Book Yet,"I've read alot of Turtledove's books World at War, Great War, How Few Remain and up to now my favorite has been JHow Few Remain butt I never cared for his other books too manyy characters complicated you really have no idea whats going on in the world. Well I must say this book is better. The characters are defitnaly known better and you geyt idea of the big picture. Personally I'm not sure if the world would havee turned out this way actually during the Civil War it was the Russians who were close to the U.S. and very nearly became a ally. So theres a good chance Russia and the U.S. might have allied against the Confederatesand Germany Well I like the idea of a United States at war in a WWII style atmosphere since I was a kid I always sort of wondered what would happan if the Civil War had ttooken place in the 1940s or who knows maybe the 1990s."
1,Unreadable,"I've read a minimum of several hundred books in my lifetime and I'm sure I could count on one hand the ones I couldn't finish. This book was one of those few. It's not a story so much as a seemingly endless series of 'scenes' in what appears to be a chronology of sorts. The problem is that there is absolutely no continuity or narrative thread. Nothing tying the characters or plot together (at least not in the approximately one-third of the book I slogged through). My other major objection is Mr. Turtledove's copious use of a particular racial epithet commonly called ""the 'N' word."" I don't generally object to the use of such language if it advances plot or character development, but Mr. Turtledove sprinkles this word around with such abandon that I have to wonder if he has some underlying motive. This book might make the bestseller list in the Hillbilly Weekly Standard but I found it to be a pointless bore."
4,"a very good book overall,but...","This is something I could not,would not put down since I took up ""The Guns Of The South"" and ""How Few Remain"" et al.The action, intrigue,and politics expressed and implied throughout the book left me asking more questions instead of tying up loose ends like most sequels normally do.Overall,this is an excellent read if it were not for the sex scenes the author has a bad habit of using as filler for his stories(which seem to escalate in quantity and intensity book by book)."
3,Even Turtledove takes a break sometimes.,"This is an OK book, nothing more. Seems like Turtledove ran low on that delicious irony that is his halmark. That said most series writers have stronger and weaker books, and they can't all be ""How Few Remain."" There are more than a few kernels in there,though, and we can wait for the next one."
2,Readable,"There's a reason this was in the $0.50 pile at the used book store. It's not terrible, but not that good.The main character is neither likable nor believable. Something felt so 'off' about the book that I had to look up the author to see if she was even British.The series might improve but I won't spend any more money on it."
2,Disappointing,"Kate Kingsbury has never written particularly clever mysteries, but her Pennyfoot series was long on charm and interesting characters. This book lacks even that. I wasn't pulled in at all, and the mystery itself was dull. I won't be reading the next installment -- there are too may other good books around."
3,Good enough way to spend a couple of hours,"Adequate start to a new series. However, the characters are a bit stereotypical and Lady Elizabeth is not particularly likeable. Easy Read."
2,Kingsbury needs to do her research,"The mystery in this book was OK, but there are so many errors and anachronisms that I was put off. The one that bothered me most - and it would have been so easy for an alert editor to catch - was that apparently the heroine's father has a living brother. Anyone familiar with the British peerage would have known that this brother would definitely have the title and probably the ancestral manor as well. Lady Elizabeth would be entitled only to what was not entailed. What's so annoying is the reference to this uncle was totally gratuitous. It could easily have been her mother's brother, or her father's sister's husband, or the paragraph could have been omitted entirely.This is not an auspicious beginning to a series. I hope Kingsbury spends a little time getting to know her subject better."
1,A Disappointment,"I wanted to like this book because I'm always looking for a good historical mystery series. The setting seemed promising--an English manor house during WWII. Unfortunately, that's as good as it gets. The heroine is completely unlikeable, and she is surrounded by characters who are flat, annoying, or downright unbelievable (particularly the butler, who is portrayed about as realistically as the ""Uncle Teddy"" character in Arsenic and Old Lace). The mystery itself held no interest for me, and the resolution was deeply unsatisfying. Overall, the book seemed amateurish and hastily thrown together. I don't usually write reviews, but in this case, I felt like I should warn potential readers not to expect much."
3,Hype overshadows caveats,"Siegel seems intent on convincing investors to buy and hold stocks, yet a close reading of his caveats clearly takes away much of his hype. For a detailed critique, see Eldred's Value Investing in Real Estate. You will never again think that you should hold (as Siegel urges) 80 to 110 percent of your portfolio in stocks. As Ben Graham advised throughout his long career, relative pricing and yields matter most. And right now, investors can find much higher expected returns in rental properties."
5,Simply the general overview on investing in Equities,"I read everything that Jeremy writes. He is simply the best researcher on equity investing alive today. Every fact in the book is extremely well researched, I imagine helped out by a team of eager finance students at Wharton, the best finance school in the world. This book gives even novice investors a very readable broad based knowledge set for investing. It also proves that equities should be the foundation of everyones long term investment portfolio. His other more recent book The Future for Investors is also a must read. I have bought both of these books for everyone in my family and have told them if they want to build wealth they will read these books."
2,More trivia that advice,"Partly an investment advice book, but more filled with history and trivia about the stock market, plus many of the author's academic studies rewritten as book chapters and thrown in. This book is for you if you want to know what happened to the original 12 companies in the Dow Jones average, or what the author found about the success of using 200-day moving averages as a market indicator. The trivia is interesting, but if you're looking for investment advice, look elsewhere."
5,holds up well,The book has held up rather well over the years despite the drastically changing economic conditions. Some good data and good analysis as well.
5,Its all true: you can get rich (but it takes a long time!),"Professor Siegel does a great job of advancing the thesis that everyone can ""get rich"" in the stock market. The caveat: you may have to wait a long time. In other words, over 200 years the US Equity market has always delivered positive returns if you are willing to wait at least 15-20 years (over 1 year periods the results are +66.6 to -38.6%). The book is well written and you do not need a financial background to enjoy it. It makes a great addition to professional's library as well."
2,Old data has to be suspect,"I love history but beware of a book that has data going back to 1800. Very unlikely to be accurate. Going back even 10 years is suspect, with the data from the BLS.But, an interesting read."
1,Hard to Read,"A difficult book to read. Filled with excess charts, boring and verbose. I suspect that most people who agree with me, are so sick that they bought the book, they have not reviewed it."
1,No help at all,"This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364: Principles of Long term investing: ""Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."" Now look at Chapter 8. ""Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2 (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."" duuhhh. Now I know what to do. I have a choice of two stocks. If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all."
1,Are you Kidding me,"Since they are ""Academics"" I expect the mumbo jumbo that they write, but to actually think that people follow there guidance is baffling. If you want to lose money, follow the ideas in this book. Maybe as soon as one of these guys does something in the market they can publish, but until then I say save your nickels and buy something useful"
5,Classic Work for your Library,"This is one of the few ""must have"" bookd for investors. I would also include Charles Ellis' ""Winning the Loser's Game"" and Malkiel's ""Random Walk on Wall Street."" No one can time markets consistently well, and very few of us are superb stock pickers, and anyone who purports to tell you you can do these things with a little study is deluded or dishonest. What you can do is control your own behavior: buy (and keep buying) a diversified stock portfolio and hold on no matter what happens. Be grateful for the market's volatility -- it is the source of the return stocks give over and above that of bonds. Siegel shows you why this approach works, and why, in the long run (to me, ten years or more), stocks are safer than bonds: because stocks are more likely to give you the return you need to reach your investment goals."
4,Snow Island,"Beautiful imagery of this small town island community. A slice of New England life. Characters are ones we've met in our lives. The plot is carefully constructed and holds the reader's attention. Rich language. Take this one with you to the beach, the mountains or your favorite vacation site. Highly recommended."
3,Not for me,"They are just ok. If you are incontinent this is not the product for you. My son is completely incontinent and i wanted something that he could pull on and off easy. Once you urinate in it it leaks out of the side. It does say that it holds 250ml, not sure it holds that much. My son is only 14 and maybe if he was older the results would be better. This is based on his usage."
3,Nothing to write home about,"The snowmen are a much better, cuter, etc. The santas are an odd red when lit, and are small, it's hard to make out what they even are unless you are up close. Not a bad decoration, but I would have prefered 2 of the snowmen."
2,Blah,"Vallee is WIMPY. What's up with that ""too-much-starch-in-my-shorts"" voice? How the heck did he EVER get popular!?!? Skip the recordings of this boring and not quite talented crooner and listen to RUSS COLUMBO or BING CROSBY, some REAL crooners."
4,Nicely Done!,"This is a nicely done introduction into muzzleloader hunting. The writing was very thorough and the pages were lavishly filed with quality color photos. Most every aspect of owning, safely using and maintaining muzzleloaders were covered. Hunting with these unique weapons was of course covered in detail.The book was a little slanted toward the ""modern"" muzzleloader crowd. While I am less interested in this, I can understand why this would be a hot topic to many hunters. The person who co-authored this book, Tony Knight, is credited with starting this phenomenon in the 1980s.This is great introduction and I would highly recommend it for someone interested in the sport. It will certainly serve as a jumping off point for further study. For some, however, it may be the only book you need on the topic."
4,"No fabulous, but really not bad :)","I would recomend this product. I have a salon in an assisted living facility. I've tried the tray on 6 clients in wheel chairs. 4 of the 6 got water on their necks, 1 stayed dry and 1 got water down their back and a little on her leg. Even with the leaky problems, I would recomend the tray. It gives clients with limited mobility the relaxation of a traditional salon shampoo. It is better than the betty dain plastic head band capes and much better than dry shampoo options. The arm strap is tricky for some, depending on their ability to hold their arms still. With a little creativity and patience, the tray can be a good addition to a salon. Since the tray is hard plastic and water is spraying on it, its a good idea to wear a smock or rain gear because the water really flys. Even with that minor hassle, it is a good tool."
1,Got soaking wet!,I got this because I am disabled and I get dizzy when I get shampooed at salon...my back got soaked! I am sad :(
1,Junk,Only got it because I don't have a shampoo bowl and needed something to pass inspection...won't fit a medium to bigger guys neck and the strap broke just demonstrating it to someone. Get it if you just need something but understand you'll never want to use it.
1,Development Pornography,"Earlier I thought the trend of ""development pornography"" had ended or slowed down, but this novel 'The Scent of Wet Earth in August' suggests that the trend is still in vogue. The writer of the novel belongs to that class of NGOs (upper middle class elitists of Pakistan) who would try to give a shock to their readers to get cheap popularity. Some experts of this subject say fierce competition for donations in a ballooning NGO sector has led to an alarming resurgence in shock tactics that critics call ""development pornography"". Here the type of the donation ""targetted"" by the author is publicity that several third world writers try to seize in the developed world or elitist sections of their own societies."
1,book,I never received this item. I paid for it immediately. I've sent many emails about it and NOTHING!
3,Zondervan NIV version???,"I purchased this Zondervan NIV version and then compared it with my regular Zondervan NIV leather bound Bible and found that it's not the same translation as my regular Bible as the verses are entirely different versions. I'm not sure what version this Zondervan NIV is, but it's not verse for verse compatible with my Zondervan NIV Bible. I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew that it wasn't compatible."
5,Love the Holy Bible,I downloaded the Holy Bible NIV version on my tablet and I absolutely love it. My friends are impressed with how quickly I can find a passage or verse. Highly recommend!
1,Very disappointed,"I just received my Kindle today and am very happy with it. However, I am disappointed in this book.It is very difficult to find the exact book, chapter and verse one wants. I may simply not know how, but having to go to home, then to the NIV Bible and then to the TOC and then to the book of the Bible and then to the chapter and then to the verse is very time consuming and frustrating.There should be a way to search for the exact point one wants by entering the citation. If there is a way to do so, I have not found. The search function does not seem to do it.I am not at all sure I would have purchased it if I had know it would be so awkward. I have several versions on my IPod and they are much easier to work with.If there are easier ways to work with this version, I would be pleased to learn them."
1,Incrementalism,"This version of the NIV IS different from the 1984 edition.It will be up to you which one you use. Before you decide, look at botheditions side by side and see if the differences matter to you.They did to me.gm"
2,GGGolferGirl,I was very disappointed in this book because it only included the old testament. I thought it included both the old and new testament. When you purchase a bible you expect to get a complete one not half.
5,Good Bible!,I would recommend this Bible to anyone. Very easy to use. Very happy with it. I can't think of any cons about it.
4,"Good translation, easy to use.","I have long relied on NIV translation, but to have it available on my iPad along side other reliable translations and commentaries is very handy, especially in a Bible study setting."
5,Great,"Great buy. Purchased this kindle version for daily reading. was an easy and quick purchase, delivery, etc... Would recommend to all"
4,NIV Rapid Reading,"Like: Excellent dynamic rendering of the Hebrew Old Testament, & of the Greek New Testament into English that is very easy to read, especially for rapid English reading. Five star for reading large sections of the Bible in one sitting. Four star for literal rendering of the text from the original. - M. Finley, Th.M. , New Testament Literature & Exegesis"
4,NIV HOLY BIBLE,"The NIV bible for my kindle fire is a nice addition to my kindle, but navigation is a little difficult and not at all intuitive."
4,phone use of Kindle version,"The NIV version is the best. I wish I had looked further and bought a study version, like our paper one. It's cumbersome to navigate around on a small cell phone screen, but it's perfect to take on trips and keep up with your bible reading program."
1,A mission to navigate.,This Kindle version sucks since it is very difficult to navigate and even hard to see what book you're in at any given moment. Do not buy.
5,NIV Bible,"It is very readable, easy to understand, and includes easy to use explanations. It is also easy to move around."
2,Holy Bible is incomplete,"I only received the old testament. I like the NIV, but I really need the new testament , too. I would appreciate learning how to get the new testament."
4,Holy Bible (NIV),"After receiving my Kindle for Christmas, the first thing I did was order the Bible. I wanted to take my Kindle to church instead of carrying a heavy Bible. I am still getting used to using it. I have had some difficulty going from book to book."
3,NIV Bible,"NIV Bible is the normal version which leaves out certain items such as ""Get thee behind me Satan"". Not the fault of the publishers but of the translators. I find it very difficult to navigate within the bible especially when I am in a study group or church."
3,Holy Bible,"Finding passages in the bible can be quite time consuming on a kindle. If you wish to read two or more passages in the old and new testament, it is difficult to locate for one sitting. This is the reason why it is only given three stars. The contents in the bible change a bit with the NIV interpretation, to become far more understandable, which is advantageous. This method of reading the bible is ideal of going on vacation, as it compresses the entire book into a readable format, and while on vacation you will have time to find the passages that you wish to read."
5,Bible,I love it! Great buy. Now I can carry my Bible where ever I go. I highly reccommend it for everyone who has a Kindle.
2,I did not like it.,"I did not like it. Many places it completely changes the meaning. I did not notice it in time to get a refund, but I deleted it from my Cloud anyway."
4,Readible on a Kindle,"This is the new NIV (as opposed to the TNIV) version, so it doesn't do away with all gender-specific references, but some. While there is some controversy in Christian circles, the world at large is probably in favor of that. As someone who started off memorizing King James, and went to the NIV in high school, I still think this is far more comprehensible, but less poetic. The kindle version makes this more like a book, as opposed to being able to easily find chapter in verse, but that was by purpose, so this fits the bill."
2,NIV Thinline Bible,"I've loved my 1986 copyright NIV Thinline Bible since early 1994. It's been my primary study Bible and the Bible I've most used in my sermons, Bible studies and small groups. It's text font is easy to read -- even standing at a lectern in less than perfect lighting conditions. I was expecting the same font readability in the 2011 version and looking forward to the updated translation/paraphrase. However, the 2011 thinline NIV is not as readable. The font appears to be thinner with perhaps lighter inking than the 84 version -- not nearly as readable. Preparing a product for an aging demographic with a less readable font does not make sense to me."
4,A good track stop watch,I got this to replace a broken Robic 800. It works fine for my application. I use it to time laps on road course Driver's Education events. It has adequate lap memory and is legible.
5,Nice Watch,Does everything I need and more for my son's track meets.I did break the plastic lens the first day by leaning into a tent post with it around my neck. Still works fine but just has a little visible crack in the plexiglass. My fault I suppose.
3,Ok.,Only really basic. I think its more designed for younger readers. Just has a few basic expression of each character. Still its handy to have if your interested in drawing these characters.
4,Good Product,"I've had this monitor for well over 3 years and the original battery has finally died. The functions are fairly easy to figure out through trial and error. I've had to do this because I have no idea where the manual is. It does not have a backlight which is a little annoying. Gym equipment does pick up the chest strap signal which is good. The bad is that wireless equipment makes the reading go crazy. I can not use my wireless phone or laptop near it while the wireless signal is activated. Otherwise this monitor has served me well, but I want one with less interference and a backlight."
4,Great buy for the money,"I should specify that when I bought this watch on Amazon it was $49.95. As I'm typing this review, it is now over $70. I have been using it for 4 months with no problems at all. I found it easy to program and it's easy to view the data for my workout. I don't even notice the chest strap when I'm wearing it, but do find the watch a bit annoying while working out. But I'm not normally a watch-wearer as is, so I probably have less tolerance for it than other people might. Overall I'm very pleased with it for the price I paid."
1,frustrated,"This Ekho E-15 Heart Rate Monitor Watch fell apart on the 4th use (the stop/start button fell out.) When I approached Amazon for information on how to return it for a refund (by email) they referred me to Ekho. When I approached Ekho for information on how to return it for a refund they referred me back to Amazon.Meanwhile, I don't have this very important piece of equipment for my work outs!What gives?"
5,Well-programmed matchup & great sound,"Two long out-of-print LPs -- ""Those Lazy ..."" from 1963 and ""My Fair Lady"" from 1964 -- make a welcome return on CD. The remastered sound is excellent and the program is relaxed and upbeat on two albums that fit together quite nicely."
3,Voice treasure in not regular repertoire,"The late Nat Cole is one of those treasures of American Music. He was a great Jazz pianist and singer, no doubt. Also a stylish balladeer with great albums but with some neglectable ones.This EMI twofer shows his two sides as a balladeer. First a neglectable album of unimportant repertoire with some few exceptions. Second there is the splendid album with 'My Fair Lady' repertoire. This is worth buying the CD.Here you'll find Mr. Cole at his best in vocal performance.A Note on UK's EMI twofers: it's incredible that we could ever have the opportunity to listen to such old and rare material. EMI has issued a long series of CD twofers in a memorable initiative to show all the splendid material by splendid artists never before released in CD."
2,Leaves much to be desired,"I bought this to replace a similar priced Karcher pressure washer (which broke after a 2 hour deck cleaning). Out of the box, the pressure regulator lever will not stay on the unit and falls off. Installing the unit involved only 2-3 steps but the pieces did not come together easily. The Karcher pressure washer had more power at this price range even though the Sistema had a higher PSI rating. Washing cars will be fine with this but forget driveways, fences, siding, or other medium duty jobs. I am beginning to think that pressure washers in this price range (below $200) are not worth the investment due to the poor reviews most of these products get."
1,I wish this would have...,"I was truly excited to receive this product. I opened, assembled and followed the instructions. Flipped the power switch and nothing, re-read the manual changed the power outlet and...still nothing! So my rating on this product is JUNK!"
2,doesn't work for me,"I was excited to receive this product after read many good reviews. I used it once on my small deck and stored it in the garage. I took it out 3 months later, and the main circuit breaker tripped everytime. Tried the reset button. The manual was no help. Called the manufacture but couldn't get through. I was lucky that Amazon would take it back for a full refund. I give it 2-star because of the parts which seemed sturdier than others in its price range. I might received a defective one."
2,"OK for an Electric, but not upto the task at hand.","I purchased this electric power washer with the hope of being able to clean decking and house siding. While it is reliable and simple to operate, it simply does not have sufficient power for those tasks. We have used it over the last year for cleaning the boat, washing cars, washing blacktop, and cleaning lawn furniture, it does not have the power needed for cleaning siding or decks, although at its most powerful setting it will strip some paint from some surfaces if you are not careful. I suspect that it would be perfect for anyone wanting a simple, but noisy, sprayer for cleaning patio stones and the like, but a garden hose adapter would likely do as well and at a significantly lower price."
2,My vote on this product: 'Pass it by',"Bought this unit in 2004. It's now April 2009 and I've given up on it for good. Too many times trying to get this thing to start. Ultimately, just not a well engineered product. I've gotten five years of use out of it -- but just too exasperating getting it to start all the time."
1,Beware of using for continual tasks,"We bought this unit for its small size and large performance. It cleans very well, has great on board wand/tool storage and rolls around quite well on lawns and gravel. The controls are laid out well and easy to understand. When we tried to wash our house with it after 35 minutes it stopped dead and was deamed ""unrepairable"" by the service center. The second(same) unit finished the other side of the house, however it would not work the next day for the car, prompting us to get a full refund."
5,Theory and Practice all in one!,"So many books on teaching are either all theory or collections of activities loosely connected by a theme. This book explains and illustrates reasearch on second language learning while at the same time describing and explaining numerous activities that put that research into action. I disagree with the person who wrote, ""I've seen better."" This is a high quality, useful book (Although, I'd be happy to read at anything people think is better)."
4,Better for elementary teachers,"Gibbons does a good job of balancing theory and practice in this book. Although some of the practice can be applied at middle school level, the book is most useful to elemntary teachers. The 6 period day common at the secondary level does not lend itself to the integrated curriculum that Gibbons recommends. This is still a good read for ESL teachers of all levels. It is a book an elementary ESL teacher or ESL coordinator should read in order to set up a good ESL program at the elementary school level."
4,"Ok, but I've seen better!","This book was a disappointment to me. I am an ESOL professional and so may have a different perspective than a mainstream teacher. It also only deals with mainstream teachers in elementary school. I think I was looking for a book that not only gave strategies for scaffolding, but a perspective on the right of ESOL students to be included in a classroom. Many mainstream teachers teach their ESOL students in a sink or swim manner and start demanding that the students be taken out or retained if they don't succeed. Bilingual education isn't an option for everybody, and sheltered English programs haven't shown their promise. I 've seen very low expectations and students don't have the opportunies that native speaking peers have. Teachers need a reason to differentiate for ESOL students. They often don't understand, and that needs to be tackled first before strategies can be discussed."
5,The story,"This book is actually based on a town. In fact its the one i live in. Their is an old opera house that is all run down and John Bellairs wrote a book about it. He also based ""The House With the Clock in its Walls"" off a Marshall house."
4,"white 13.25"" Patio Clock","The clock arrived with short cracks at the center of the plastic face, but the cracks were not long enough for me to want to return it. I have it on my back porch, and it is working fine. It is perfect in size, color, and shape for what I needed."
2,There are rooms for Improvement,"I have no intention to doubt Jerry Scutts' techniques in making military vehicle models. This is the first book from Jerry that I have read and it is on the down side when compared to Tony Greenland's Panzer Modelling Masterclass.I have been making military models for 30 years and I have read hundreds of books on this subject around the world. So far, Tony Greenland's book is still the classic on my list. There are also many other good books from Japan, Korea, France . . . .This book is not well organised, the pictures are of average quality and the layout is sometimes confusing. Not a 'must have' for military vehicle modelling enthusiasts."
1,Don't want to read it again.,"Far from being a good book on this subject at all. I also owned a copy of Tony Greenland's ""Panzer Modelling Master"" and that one deserves 5+ stars.The editor should pay more attention on the layout and format of this book. It just failed to keep my attention while reading it. I have no intention to read it again."
2,The item pictured is not what you receive............,"Go Diego Go To The Rescue 4 X 4The item pictured with this $27.00 price is not the item you will actually receive. The Diego talking 4x4 rescue vehicle is pictured, and that is what I wanted. I thought the price was a great deal, all those animals, Diego and the car. What I received was an entirely different Diego product. I received a much smaller vehicle and one of the animal figures was completely missing from the box. Very disappointed with my purchase."
1,Three thumbs down!,"This book should be renamed ""DON'T Marry Me!"" or ""Why you DON'T (ever) want to marry (or meet) a professional man"". I think that authors mistakengly assumed that they represent all professional men. We can only hope they were wrong! If they aren't, we must steer clear off all ""professionals"" for our own sake. There's no place for Love in the authors' world. I don't think authors will ever be satisfied by the woman whom they find using their own guidelines, a woman who can fit them or can sucessfully pretend that she can. The next step, after a few years, would be cheating with your wife's best friend, I'm afraid.. So, ladies: do you want to be enslaved to desires, needs and likes of a man who entirely doesn't care about you or cares if you're healthy and alive only as much as he'd care about his any other property, like a car? Do you want to serve HIS CAREER with YOUR LIFE? Buy this book.."
1,Garbage!,"The only insight provided by this book is that there are still old-school, chauvanstic males even in ""Generation X"" and they're disguising themselves as modern, professional men. What sane woman would want to marry a man that expects HER life to revolve around him, his needs, his interests, his career and his emotional well-being while requiring her to stifle her own thoughts, interests, etc. lest they conflict with his version of a ""perfect wife""? If a woman ""lands"" such a husband by completely changing herself, then the marriage has no basis in common values or interests, etc. A recipe for divorce and a clear display of the arrogance and immaturity of the authors."
1,More Like How to Get Mr. Wrong to Pop the Question,"Yeah, I don't recommend this book. I don't even think it's just noneffectual, I think it could be damaging and lead you getting involved with low-class men. The mentality here is not of the caliber of men I'm hoping you want for yourself.But, here are some books I do recommend very much, that I think can help you find a real Mr. Right: THE SURRENDERED SINGLE, GETTING TO COMMITMENT, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, WHY MEN MARRY SOME WOMEN AND NOT OTHERS. Also I recommend reading this book while in a relationship or marriage: RELATIONSHIP RESCUE. As you read these, one at a time, you will feel yourself steering along the right path. May good things happen for you."
2,Marry Me!: Three Professional Men Reveal,Okay got this from a friend.. didn't like it. All it is little stories... but that is really much all it. There is no real revelation in it. Waste of money. Buy it for kicks but there are better advise and stories than this.Their first book is better.
5,Enchanting Movie,The dancing princesses is one of the best stories out of the faerie tale theatre collection. It was my favorite movie when I was a girl. It's such a shame though that they no longer have these available for purchase though. I would certainly buy the series.
5,Exaclty what I wanted,This is a movie I watched as a child and had not seen in years. It arrived quickly and was in perfect condition.
3,Great Deal,"Need it for a college course, was offered at a great price much cheaper then the campus bookstore. Arrived in a timely fashion."
1,Did not work,"I ordered four of these for our office and none of them worked as they were supposed to work. They would work if a lamp was plugged into the control spot, but not when the computer was plugged into the control spot, even when the sensitivity setting was adjusted as far as it could go. Their website simply stated that if this was the case, something else should be plugged into the control spot; but the whole point of purchasing them was so that when we turned off our computers, the peripherals would go off as well. I returned all of them."
1,Energy Saving Smart Strip,"Doesn't work.It's not sensitive enough to work with a low wattage tuner that draws about 15 watts when on and 2 watts when off. Can be set to turn on the controlled outlets, but will not turn them off. If sensitivity is adjusted to turn them off, it will not turn them back on."
5,Great way to be green at home!!,I felt compelled to write in response to the other negative review. We have two smart strips for our tv/dvd/stereo. Ours work fantastic. It's awesome and we loved it!. This is an easy no brainer way for everyone to save a significant amount of dead energy with no extra work!! Seriously.
2,Not Exactly as advertised.................,"As I understood this product from the Oprah show, all appliances plugged into this strip turn off and draw no power when ""off"".......Be aware that it does not work quite that way and will not save you as much power as you might think[very little, actually]. A ""Control device"" such as a TV must be plugged into the ""control device outlet"" and thus is always on in the ""Standby mode"" drawing power, waiting for a command, for instance, from your remote control. Other devices, such as, DVD player or VHS player cannot be operated unless the ""Control Device"" is turned ""On""[This is okay], but others such as CD player or Stereo Receiver cannot be turned on unless ""Control Device""[TV] is turned on, thus these must be plugged into a ""live"", or ""always on"" outlet.........Just be aware of this before you buy......It should be fine for PC peripherials......."
2,Quality is not there,"Bought 2 of these strips in January 2008. They seemed to work fine until June 2009. Strange thing, they both started making this terrible, irritable noise everytime a device was cut on. I had to stop using them and of course, the warranty was up. I would not recommend these strips, I went back to using my old ones, which have been working for years."
1,Not sure that it does what it says it will do,"This product seems to keep clicking and I am not sure why. Not sure if it reduces the electricity usage, or what. I might not have it hooked up properly, but have my TV, DVD, Surround Sound and all the parts of my entertainment center plugged into it."
2,Smart surge protector,"It sounded like a great idea but I have used the SCG5 not SCG4 for several weeks now but have still not been able to get my hard-drives & speakers to turn on & off with my Mac G4 tower plugged in to the master outlet. I continue to adjust the sensitivity knob as instructed, but so far no luck. I may just have to turn it on & off manually."
1,Power strip,"I ordered this product thinking I would be saving money. Some electronics need to be kept on to operate. For instance if you have a DVR you cant turn it off due to recordings occurring while not watching. Its very sensitive about turning off all things plugged into it, I had to adjust it several times and it still doesnt operate as promised. For all this money and Im still leaving things on, where is the savings?"
2,Good Concepts about Fear of Man,"A good friend recommended this book to address our fear of man instead of our holy fear of God. After a slew of complaining parents at school and an ever-tightening knot in my stomach, I decided that I wanted to read it. As it addresses the topic of fear, I think there was much to glean. However, it was a bit too counsel-ly for me. Some aspects reminded me of the books I had to read in a counseling class in college, and that's not a good thing.Welch offers important reminders that as Christians, we must not give in to becoming people pleasers, a temptation that I lean toward. God is to be the one I'm trying to ""impress."""
2,not what i thought,I purchased the book in the hopes of being empowered and then giving the book to other abuse survivors to encourage them. I am unable to do so because the book for me came across as a theological textbook. Although the theology is accurate I felt it was misplaced and the writing lacked relational intelligence. I thought the author dealt with very sensitive issues with an abrupt and unfeeling manner. I think this book could be good for seminary students but not really for women struggling with victimization. It just depends on your purpose for buying the book.
3,it was good.,"The book ""when People is Big and God is Small"" was in good conditions as the seller described. there was honesty in this description and it is in very good conditions!"
5,A Biblical Theology of Dependence,"Ed Welch has penned a thoroughly biblical theology of dependence (upon God), interdependence (with God's people), and co-dependence (diagnosing the true cause and prescribing the true cure for co-dependence). It is books like ""When People Are Big and God Is Small"" that are revolutionizing Christian counseling by providing a practical, relevant, biblical psychology of specific issues and concerns in our post-modern world.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of ""Soul Physicians,"" ""Spiritual Friends,"" ""Biblical Psychology,"" ""Martin Luther's Pastoral Counseling,"" and ""Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction."""
5,This book's incredible in applying the Gospel to daily life.,"Ed Welch gets right to the point when he writes of our worshiping people instead of God! If we fear people more than we fear the Lord, we're in trouble. The basic theme is that we must need other people less and love them more!"
4,great selection of songs,"This album contains a great selection of songs. Most of them are of a ragtime-like style. Etting has a very touching, lethargic voice that effortlessly delivers wistfulness. And there is certainly no lacking of eloquence in her phrasing.The re-mastering is good overall. However, a few songs have some slight echo effect and I'd rather have them without that. Track No. 14 has skippings."
4,*Eerie*,"Ruth Etting's ""Ten Cents a Dance"" is composed of very eerie songs, especially ""Dancing With Tears in My Eyes."" This particular song will bring shivers to your spine. I could definitely see this song in a movie soundtrack where some sort of tragedy occurs.The following is a list of the *best* songs on this album:1.) Dancing With Tears in My Eyes2.) Funny Dear, What Love Can Do3.) But I Do, You Know I Do!4.) Sam, The Old Accordian Man5.) Ten Cents A Dance6.) If I Could Be With You One Hour TonightThe following is a list if the *worst* songs on this album:1.) Mean to Me: = very [bad], desperate lyrics --> skip it2.) Body & Soul: = creepyP.S. Ruth Etting's songs are better composed than Annette Hanshaw's. Etting's songs are better organized & have better melodies. Most of Hanshaw's songs are somewhat boring, except for ""Ain't He Sweet."" = her best song"
1,Worst product I have ever used,Nilodor is the worst smelling product I have ever used. I have 6 dogs and trust me we have accidents. I read the reviews about the odor but had no idea that it would take weeks for the nilodor odor to leave. It was almost better to leave the doggie odor than to use Nilodor. Even with the doors and windows open the odor was still there and would hit you as you walk in the door. I had to use plain water in my rug doctor and keep going over and over it to get to Nilodor out. I will NEVER use it again.
5,the best,"I've used this for years and it's the best cleaner I've ever found. It goes a long way, has a fresh scent and is safe around animals and it gets rid of all doggie odors. I am never without a jug of this in my house!"
3,"Cleans as Good as Ever, but that New Scent...Ugh!","I've been using this Nilodor product for decades to clean and disinfect our Cattery. The product seems to be as good as ever, but the latest gallon I bought has a new scent, and it is by no means an improvement. UGH!!!"
1,Crap,"Doesn't work nearly as well as it claims to :( We have used it multiple times, just as directed, and it just doesn't work. It smells funny, too."
5,Fantastic book,"This is the best, easiest to read, and most complete work I've seen on the Pentecostal (or Armenian) theology of salvation. Excellent book that I am so, so happy I stumbled upon!! If you are looking for a book to solidify your beliefs or are Calvinist and looking for a book to explain differing beliefs, pick this book up."
5,A Real Find,"With any kind of play time, ""Caterpillar Cowboy"" could become the anthem for dirt movers everywhere. McIntosh's voice evokes some space between Jimmy Rodgers and Dwight Yoakum that has needed to be filled. Add his songwriting talents and what we have, purely and simply, is a real talent just waiting for a listener."
4,intriguing,"Some songs are clearer than others, but still a lot of fun. It's the only CD I've been able to find for this era with original artists."
1,Way Too Bizzare,"There are currently three productions of Thais out on DVD and unfortunately all fall short, some miserably so. I'm so glad that I didn't buy this version, as it is painful to watch. I guess some companies/artistic directors want to make a statement, but I don't know why they feel the need to film it. There comes a point when no matter how good the voices are, they can't overcome the distractions of a poorly conceived production. It would be nice to see a full scale opulent production of this opera, as the story and time period lend themselves to that. So far, the Renee Fleming version comes closest to what opera purists may desire, but even that production has it's issues. It's productions like this that keep the term ""eurotrash"" in the vocabulary."
4,"Sensuous production, weak Thas","Poda's production is a modified form of Robert Wilson's gestural theater; movement of principal singers is stylised, very slow, against an elaborately staged, symbolic background, but lavishly costumed. One either likes this or doesn't. (What happens in the language often isn't reflected on stage: e.g., Athanael doesn't get a new robe--that's part of the sryle.) There is a large contemporary dance component throughout, often largely unclothed, often effective, and much more animated. Ateneli is in excellent voice, but the production's great weakness is Frittoli's Thas--her voice is often harsh, wobbly, and strained. None of the warmth or sensuality of Fleming. The orchestra and sound fabric is very fine. (And note the shots of the interior of the new opera house in Turin glimpsed at the beginning--stunning.) Secondary material missing; an interview with Poda seems essential."
1,Poor Quality,"""We used the sling shot two times before the rubber straps snapped off. I was very disappointed with the assembly of the product and much to my dismay I saw on the back of the packaging it said, ""Assembled by the Handicapped"" I really wish that the manfacturer stated this in their product description. Bottom line, a huge disappointment and a let down for the holiday. Save your money."""
4,Nambib Desert,This was an excellent video. It covers an area that so little is known about. I found it most informative and intriguing. From this video I learned about a land that I though was realitively not inhabited. Almost anyone can watch this video and come away with more knowledge then they started with. The land is so harsh and different that the creatures are very intriguing in their differences.
5,A monumental account of the era of Jim Crow,"Leon Litwack's book offers perhaps one of the most lucid and thorough descriptions of life under Jim Crow. By the time you turn the final page, it will be clear that Jim Crow is about far more than signs over drinking fountains. Rather, it was a systemic attempt to re-impose white supremacy after the yoke of slavery had been cast off. Despite others' criticisms, I found Litwack's evidence more than compelling. As a student of history, I must say that his coverage was complete, and his analysis was accurate. Trouble in Mind depends upon a wide variety of sources, including mainstream, white, periodicals. Perhaps what is most disturbing is that many of the primary-source documents are from mainstream, ""white"" sources."
5,"American history, as written in blood","Very few non-fiction books ever written in this country have been as astonishing,as factually solid, and as thoroughly disturbing. To read a book like this is to understand that there is something basically wrong with the way we have all been taught history. It isn't simply that we have never learned the entire history of segregation, of Jim Crow law, of lynchings, of post-Reconstruction (although we certainly haven't.) It's that our understanding of history has been sanitized beyond all recognition or resemblance to its true state. History as taught in schools is *perhaps* (and this is really being generous) comparable to five or six degrees ripped from a three hundred and sixty degree circle. Every once in a while, a book like one of Leon Litwack's comes along, and adds a liberal helping of degrees to our historical plates."
5,Practical Process Engineering: A Working Approach to Plant Design,"This is one the most complete and succinct collection and discussion of the ""practical"" chemical engineering calculations with the exception of Perry's Handbook."
5,LOVE the 88,"This is such a GREAT album and yes, ""Coming Home"" is the chirpy little tune that was featured on the Target commerical and is so upbeat and catchy. The entire album is awesome."
3,Slackware is a great learning distribution!,"I was introduced to Linux back in 1995 and the distro was Slackware. It was tough going back in those days, had to set up everything manually. I learned to love Linux and several of the distros that followed (Redhat, Suse, Caldera, etc) but I've always kept Slackware as my workhorse distro. If you have a question about Linux, ask a Slackware user.The book is only so-so, I support the Slackware project but, the book glances over so many topics and delves into just a few and then doesn't touch topics like setting up a printer! There are better books for the advanced linux user but the newbie would benefit."
3,New?,"W. Boudville's review is a little confusing. He seems to imply that Slackware is new. This is simply not correct. Page two of this very book states, ""Slackware, started by Patrick Volkerding in late 1992, and initially released to the world on July 17, 1993, was the first Linux distribution to achieve widespread use.""If you are interested in this book, I reccomend purchasing it only if you want to support the Slackware project. Otherwise, it is available for free online, at http://slackware.com/book/.I am giving the book 3 stars, as this is more of a comment than a review, and I want to skew the results as little as possible."
5,A Must Have,This book is excellent to have in your library. If you have children it works as a great homework assignenment because they do not teach black history in school.
4,Beautiful,I purchased four of these to add decoration to my backyard. They are really lovely. I love the green glass and the finish of the bronze. They are a bit tricky to get a lit candle in there though.
4,strong follow up,"...this cd is more polished than the previous cd...which can sometimes spoil things for rock fans...but over all its a stronger effort than ""permission to land""...I've been purchasing music since 1970 (only back then it was LP's and 8 track tapes) and many of the titles from that era remain fresh and enjoyable 10, 20, even 30 years later. The Darkness seems to be on the same level as some of those artists. I believe their music will stand up to the test of time, which to me is a sign of quality. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoyed their last cd, or to anyone who enjoys good, solid rock music."
1,WTF?!?,"This album is doesn't even come close to 'Permission to Land'...It's not that I'm expecting it to be the same as that one, just to have the same magic that I found there.And sadly, I'm not hearing it with this one. Not at all.While it still sounds like them, It's as if they've been replaced by some Darkness cover band.[who ain't got the chops to produce music on par with the truly great music on Permission]I am very disappointed by this album."
5,Pure Brilliance,The best album of 2005. There is a bit of everything in this album and every bit is amazing. There is no low point. Is it is as good as the Permission to Land? For sure plus a bit more.
2,what's the deal?,are the darkness a real band or are they taking the piss out of all the good rock and metal from the 70's I.E trex led zeppelin dep purple AC/DCi know i'm not allowed on opipion an a band if it's not a kiss ass review well sorry some of us don't like the squeaky kicked in the balls singing and mellow rock with a bit of distortionif i wAnted rock like this i would dust off my motley crue recordsso really the darkness aren't saviours of rock that haven't given us anything new they've just given me more vomit to producethe EGO'S on the dorkness are stupid they think their that greatWELL they're not they suckoh yeah sorry for having an opipion maybe amazon shouldn't allow bad reviews i don't know
1,WTF??????,i'm at a loss for words. i've never heard such awful music (is it music??) in my entire life...i only rated this one star because they made me...
3,These guys rock........but,"These guys certainly rock, and are a breath of freshness but....damn, the singers voice gets annoying. Do yourself a favor and go to iTunes and download the best from both albums...it'll cost about $10."
1,A couple god songs,"This album isn't great at all.Nothing like the first one.This album is one reason why they are broken up.Well why the lead singer,guitar player left.1 star is what I give it."
2,Doesn't work,"Coming of an overrated first album, this album is abit more easy to listen to, but the problem is that the singer just isn't very good. Also, the songs are just weak! There are only 4 decent tracks here:One Way TicketBaldHazel EyesIs It Just MeDo yourself a favor and download these songs for 99 cents each and just skip the rest of the album. It's just too dull and the guitarwork is kinda repetitive.Oh, and Hawkins bad vocals show the worst on the ballads.ouck!"
3,WAS TED TEMPLEMAN BUSY?,"God, I loved every bit of the 1ST LP. Everything. This new one, I dunno; Roy Baker Thomas making them out to be the next Queen? Production overkill and some really lame songs make this 2nd effort a puzzle. I was sure the band would come out with both guns blazing, but so much of this sounds like outtakes from Sheer Heart Attack. What gives? No one great song like the 1ST LP. Next time around fellows; ditch the producer, crank the guitars up to 11, get rid of queen crap, and friggin' rock like we know you can...please"
3,"pretty good, but some fans are ignorant !","a pretty good album from the darkness but ignorant people like poster ""jeffery"" makes darkness fans sound stupid. Jeffery, are you seriously comparing a darkness album with the legendary queen! are you serious?...wake up my man, any queen album blows this out of the water, even the weaker albums are light years better than this."
1,Onr way ticket to the trash can,"Listening to this makes me wanna pull out my classic AC/DC albums with Bon Scott of the 70's, cause I know they sound similar and are better. This band is so unoriginal its surprising how popular they are cause to me they are just another crap 70's rock rip-off band."
2,It's a dud,"Entertainment Weekly was right on with their grade of ""D+"" for this CD. I bought it because I liked the previous Darkness release, but this one veers strongly into silly hard rock that is at best annoying and at worst completely lacking in any entertainment value whatsoever. There were moments on this CD where I heard traces of Boston, the ""lite metal"" of Scorpions or Def Lep, and most of all a whole lot of Queen. Unfortunately they've captured only the SOUND of those bands without any of the sparkle or melodic skill that made them special. I'm pretty amazed that there are people giving this album 5 STARS. (!!!????) It just goes to show, there's no accounting for taste (or a complete absence of it)."
4,More greatness from the Darkness,"I didn't think it was possible for the Darkness to actually top Permission to Land but with ""One Way Ticket to Hell..."" they may have actually done it. The music is a bit more layered and produced and that's fine by me. The important thing is that it rocks, it's catchy, and it's hilarious. The song ""One Way Ticket"" is the best song about cocaine ever written and a possible successor for ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love. You won't be able to get the chorus from ""Knockers"" out of your head and songs 3 and 4 are awesome. Hazel Eyes is proably my favorite song on the album. My wife swears they played that song at the concert in West Palm Beach but it seems like I would have remembered a song this great. Bald is another standout track and one that I can certainly relate to. The rest of the songs on the record are solidly good songs. I hope this record finally brings The Darkness the attention in the U.S. that they deserve."
5,Refreshingly Different and Not Quite the Same,"I've realized from reading the reviews that there sure is alot of buzz going around about The Darkness. Whether or not you love 'em or hate 'em is irrelevent. People are buying the CD and this album made a prominent music magazine's top 25 list for '05. One Way Ticket is undeniably catchy and different although give up trying to sing along with Justin Hawkins--his falsetto is cosmic. The comparisons to Queen and others is a compliment more than anything. I think people who are longing for ripping guitar solos should stick with their old standbys. This band is making music in a totally untraditional style in many ways (sitar in One Way Ticket, pianos, hell--even almost exclusive falsetto, etc.)but very traditional in others......they're genious. Don't be ashamed to like or even love The Darkness. There's a little darkness in all of us. A keeper for sure."
1,Terrible. Huge dissapointment after their great last album.,"This album was one the biggest dissapointment of 2005 for me. Their first album, ""Permission To Land"", was simply awesome. Creative, innovative, good guitar work, and fun. This one is soft, over-produced, not interesting and very boring. I can't believe this is even the same band. If you are thinking about buying this record because it might sound like their first one, DO NOT. Steer clear of this one.Dice"
1,nooooooooooo !!,the movie is a rare gem unique five stars and ricci is great as usual-- and i loved the soundtrack-- so many great songs i never heard before that i liked- looked forward to getting them on cd so i ordered the soundtrack-- and didnt bother to read what others wrote and paid the price--none of the great songs from the movie !! none !!! who would listen to this but the composers mom---- maybe !!
4,A difficult path,"The modern physicist learns about electromagnetism as a done deal; a very polished product centred about Maxwell's equations. But this book shows the long forgotten tribulations and controversies that got us to today's known state.This text is rather specialised. You need to be thoroughly conversant with electromagnetism. On a par with Jackson's text, ""Classical Electrodynamics"". But presumably you also have an interest in the history of your field. Darrigol shows that the path was often obscure. Only in full hindsight, after Maxwell and also Einstein made their contributions, did it all come clear.The scarcity of vector notation in the 19th century accounts can make reading some of the equations a little awkward. You have to perform some slight mental contortions to reinterpret what they're saying, in modern notation."
1,Watchzone doesn't honor their guarantees,"Watchzone has a lowest price guarantee so I emailed them asking them to honor this. After 6 days waiting for an answer, I had to email them back asking them to answer my original question. They finally answered and I received this short answer:""your price match has not been approved, the website for wristwatch is not working.."" however everyone else I send this link to (see below) says it works fine.Since you can't add URL's to reviews, all you need to do is Google Diesel DZ5087 and click the 3rd link from wristwatchking and you will see the link(s) I sent. I sent the link shown on Google as well as the redirected link.I will not do business with them. Poor service and doesn't honor their guarantee blaming their own ineptitude at following links."
1,Broken after one week of use,"It worked initially, but it is really cheaply made. I have no idea why it doesn't work anymore but I finally just threw it out. Don't waste your money."
4,Good,Use it in the car. Pretty good for its price. My husband has an iPhone and it.s really convenient when we go on long trips.
1,Car I pod Charger,Charger dose not work there is something wrong with it got it to work once think there is something wrong with the plug
2,Use With My iPhone 4... Charges On and Off,"I have had mixed success. Sometimes the charger works right, but if the dock connector is not just right in the iPhone, or if you move the iPhone around, it will usually stop charging! Very annoying, especially with the vibrate going on and off over and over."
5,I've got a question..,"So, I just bought my car charger, and it hasn't come in the mail yet.. but I didn't even check to make sure it could charge an iPod Touch? The reviews are great, and I have an older iPod I can use in the car instead, but I just wanted to ask if anyone has been using it for their ""newer age"" iPods?"
1,Worked for one day and then died,"I guess I was just the unlucky one, as others posted that it worked for them for 6 months so far with no problems, etc., but for me it stopped working after one day.After one day, it the red light that indicates iPod's being charged doesn't go on anymore. That's pretty much all there's to it.. I guess I should've known better than to buy at this price. Lesson learned!"
2,Ehh,"Ordered four chargers to keep in the car. Opened the package and only two of them worked. Didn't mind since they were so cheap, but would have been nice if they all worked."
1,Worked great until it stopped working,"I had this for...a little over a month I think, happy charging my ipod in my car while on the go. Then one day I realized that I had driven for a long time and yet the ipod did not display the little lightning bolt that tells you that it's charging. I tried replugging, using a different outlet, and good oldfashioned banging but it didn't change anything. The red indicator light that is supposed to show you that juice is flowing faithfully stayed lit even though it wasn't actually charging my device. :("
3,:-(,...Does not work for Iphone 3G but works great with my moms iphone...not that she has a car...or a need for it...
1,charger burnt up!,I used this charger maybe 6 times and it burnt up!!! I'm just glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it! You get what you pay for!
3,Late!,I was a little sceptical when I ordered it because it took over a month to arive and it was supposed to arrive in a week.The plastic is very cheap and light the kind that would break if was to be dropped but I guess you get what you pay forAnother thing is that some times my iPod rejects it so I will have to pull it out and put in a couple times until it worksThough I am happy that it gets the job done
1,Didn't work...,"Opened the package, plugged it into my truck, plugged in my iPod, didn't do anything. Oh well, I bought it for $3.25 so I didn't really expect it to work. It looks like other people have kinda gotten theirs to work, so it's kind of a hit or miss product."
3,Don't use with iTouch,When using the charger and audio cable at the same time there was interference in the line and the audio had interference in it; sounded like a distant radio station.
1,"Total Junk, does not fit properly","First off I bought two at the same time from bargaincell on this page and the two I received were different looking than the one in the picture.- The plug is wider so the audio jack will not fit at the same time as the charger, basically you have to charge or listen to music, not both at the same time.- The chargers are flaky you have to wiggle them around to just the right spot to make it work.Once again this was the one from bargaincell so if you buy from another vendor on this page it may vary but their version is utter junk even for $5 shipped."
1,No.,"Honestly, I was very disappointed. It says in the title that it is compatible with iPhones (it is NOT) and it didn't charge my iPod classic, either. Luckily I only bought it for 35 cents or I'd be very upset. It charges my husband's iPod so he can use it, but I definitely will be purchasing a charger made especially for iPhones now.ALSO: it gets HOT VERY QUICKLY."
1,Not so hot,Worked great for 1 week then quit charging my ipod. Kept trying over the next several weeks but never worked again even though the charge light would come on. Luckily it was only $.99.
1,Incredibly cheap junk,This has to be the cheapest junk imaginable and to charge $35.00 for it is a rip off at best and a scam at worst the bits are marked so tiny and lightly you can barely read them also the hex bits half are marked both sae and metric which is impossible unless you are stupid BUYER BEWARE IF YOU WANT TO SPEND $35 ON A SET THAT YOU CAN GET AT THE NEAREST JUNK STORE FOR $2 STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRASH!!!!!!!!
1,Poor Quality from Wiha,"I have purchased many Wiha tools and this is the first time I was not satisfied. Bits looked and felt cheap, the extension was a joke, and the case was too flimsy to hold it all together. The first time I tried using the extension, the ball that was supposed to hold the bits in fell out in my hand. I returned it and now a proud owner of precision screwdrivers from Wera. Hopefully Wiha will get their act together on the System 4 tools and improve the quality control measures. Thanks to Amazon, returns were painless and fast!"
4,Very Good But Not Quite Complete,"The book couldn't be better exept for one thing. There is some information lacking that should have been taught before you get to the part of the book that teaches chords. You all of a sudden come into contact with notations that you don't have a clue as to what their meaning is if you've never read music before. Dim means ""diminished"", but what does that mean? what does a ""7"" mean when it appears in the name of a chord. etc. Up until that part at the end though, I felt the book was doing a really good job."
5,Good sampler of jazz guitar virtiouso,"Eddie Lang was the greatest jazz guitarist prior to Django Reinhart(many feel Woody Allen's movie ""Sweet & Lowdown"" was a mock bio on him, being played by Sean Penn!), and in this CD compilation one gets a good idea of Lang's talents, this CD features him mostly playing as a sideman, however Lang's solos are always great. If you want his solos and his groups as a leader buy ""Pioneers Of The Jazz Gritar"""
4,Jazz Guitar Pioneer,"A very good collection of early guitarist Eddie Lang's work. The standouts are the tracks with Lonnie Johnson; it makes one wish there were more in this anthology. The music, of course, sounds quite dated (it is the late 20's/early 30's, after all), but works as a time capsule of what jazz sounded like before the Swing Era. The tracks give a good cross section of artists that Lang performed with (King Oliver, Hoagy Carmichael, et al)."
5,Classic,"Stranger In Moscow is one of the best songs from Michael Jackson's 30 year career as a solo artist. It is a beautifully done song that has so much depth and meaning, it truly reaches out and touches the listener, like much of his music. This song is classic, its hauntingly beautiful and this single is worth the price alone just to have the remixes, get it this is a milestone in his career."
5,One of the best Michael Jackson songs ever!,"This is Michael at his best! The most powerful track from History! And the remixes are possibly better than the original!!!!! Hani has done it again. His two remixes are some of the greatest mixes EVER!!!!!!! If you don't have this maxi-single MJ fan or not, It's A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!"
1,very flimsy and move around a lot,"I was trying to save a few bucks and it backfired as it often does. These mats are very flimsy, don't stay put, and tend to bunch up around my feet which can cause issues and hazards when trying to focus on the pedals. I hear the clear version is a little stiffer and might not move aorund as much, but the black and gray ones have the same issues."

1,Disappointed with paperback version,"My friend and I ordered each ordered copies of the paperback version of Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss Shopper's Guide. We were both extremely disappointed. The paperpack edition does not contain any illustrations! This experience is unique as I have never seen such a difference between hardcover and paperback versians of any publication. It was the illustrations along with the text that made the hardcover edition so worthwhile. That old saying that pictures are worth a 1000 words is even more significant with Shapiro's book! Consequently, I am returning the paperback edition and ordering a copy of the original hardcover book."
3,It's okay,Not really worth the expense. I found it boring and useless. I wouldn't recommend this. It was mailed promptly and would suggest a used copy
5,INTERESTING CRIME MYSTERY - FAST READ,"I read this book in one evening and it was worth the time. Interesting story with good character development and a great twist ending. Includes it all, Sports, the Mob, Crime in a great story line. I recommend you read it. It's worth your time and money."
4,"Nice pictures, great read","I like the other reviewer could not wait to get my book! However the other reviewer does not realize that books like this never publish color photos since it is quite expensive and costly. (There are two nice color photos on the back though that the other reviewer failed to let us know about).It has interviews with the cast, its nice to see the ratings for the series and why it eventually went off the air. The episode guide covers a lot i didnt know about the show.The pictures in my book were not blurry at all and were quite clear, even the one with April and Micheal near a knight rider birthday cake....very cool.A great read as well, highly recommended. The only thing I thought could be better was getting Hasselhoff himself, and not every interview he ever did where he says the same thing over and over, thats why I gave it 4 stars."
4,Pretty good book. Great details,"Other than the typo's in this book, it is good. You can learn a lot about the car, the people in the show (why did William Daniels deny credit for Kitt's voice, and why did Patricia MacPherson leave the show then come back) as well as how the show came about. Great history and details behind the scenes.There is also a good episode guide that gives you background on each episode as well as listing episodes that were written but never filmed. I would definitely recommend this title for any Knight Rider fan."
2,An entertaining read with horrible pictures.,"As a huge fan of the show when I was a child, this book sparked great interest when I found it on the amazon site, and ordered it right away. The material in the book is quite good and is a good read for any Knight Rider fan, however the black and white newsprint style pictures are horrible. In fact, the pictures reminded so much of old 1970's newspapers, but I don't think these are the kinds of memories the book hopes to bring back to loyal followers.I rated this book rather low, not because of the content of the book, but because of the horrible quality of pictures in the book. I know that I didn't buy a picture book here, but I feel that the book would have been better off without the pics at all."
3,Goode Leisure Reading,"Having watched this series as a kid, I was glad to see a companion book come onto the market. All the basic information relating to the creation of the show, as well as, an episode by episode synopsis is detailed, easy to read and provided in a logical format. For those looking for behind the scenes photos of some of K.I.T.T.'s stunts or very detailed technical information concerning how the stunts were done, consider viewing any information that may be available online. It is in this area that this book demonstrates its weaknesses. Much of the provided information could be easily created by anyone who has studied the show.In general, this is an extremely good book for those looking for all of the basics of the show and how it came to exist. The extras listed under each episode provide some neat details to look for when watching the show. Depsite its shortcomings, would I recommend this book - YES!"
5,"Really hilarious book from a talented teenager,","This is a very, very funny book. The descriptions and comments on the websites are really well written, and the rating system is great. The book is even more funny once you start looking at the wacky websites.The web pages themselves are DEFINITELY ""unbelievably stupid"". I loved ""The Church of Shatnerology"" ...where they worship Captain Kirk and T.J. Hooker, and ""The Center for the Prevention of Shopping Cart Abuse"" ... where Bob Crane from Hogan's Heroes lives on as a shopping cart abuser.The thing that I found most impressive was that this book was written by a 17 year old high school student. Read this next to your computer and you're in for hours of fun."
1,Give it a rest!,"This poor boy needs to keep his opinions in the trash where they belong. Yes, many of these sites were amusing. Yes, some were foolish, ridiculous, or just plain laughable. But for gosh sake, insulting them was not necessary! If they're truly stupid, that should speak for itself -- the author doesn't need to embellish it. I visited one site, The Long Hair Site, and it's centered around exchanging information for healthy hair growth, and encouraging women who are interested in growing their hair out. Is this unusual? Sure! But it's no different than professional bikers or gourmet chefs exchanging advice and tidbits of encouragement. Dan Crowley should have done better research into the nature of the websites, and presented that information in a more discreet manner. I give this book one star for gross immaturity and lack of tact."
2,Interesting List But Insulting,"Even a page of one of my old web sites made a list of lame web sites, but it's usually done in a fun or humorous way. I wouldn't even mind a book written in the style of The Golden Turkey Awards.Overall, the list of sites is interesting, but the comments seem to insult the fans of certain sites more than the web sites themselves. ...based on the sites I scanned through. I got irritated with the writer's shallow view of things. (Yeah, I know he's 17, but I expect more from a mass produced book.) I had trouble reading all of the book. Anything he didn't seem to understand or agree with was immediately discounted as ""Stupid."" There is also very little information about the web sites mentioned which shouldn't be a surprise when there are two sites mentioned on each page.I have no problem with a book that lists and pokes fun at the unusual web sites. I just can't recommend this one. This material is more suited for a personal web site."
2,"Great sites, but...","I wish Crowley would just list the sites, give a brief description and leave it at that. The ""comments"" are awful - I don't even know the guy and I seriously dislike him because his comments bug me THAT much. I have hisother book, 505 Weirdest OnLine Stores. You know, both of his books are a good resource for when you're bored and want something funny to look up while you're in front of the computer, but Mr. Crowley, seriously, your attempts at humor and being ""cool"" have failed miserably. Stick to just listing stuff. trust me."
2,Just another lackluster website in book form.,"A few of the sites listed are actually entertaining, but most are just the usual online drivel. The writer's comments are as boring as the websites he lists; either his sarcasm doesn't translate without emoticons, or he simply isn't a very good writer. This book would have worked much better as just a website itself. I may have bookmarked the website, but I definitely wouldn't pay for the book."
3,Holy smoke! I'm in this book!,"I was doing a Google search for one of my usernames to see where all it would pop up on the web, and came across a listing for this book. Apparently, at least two of my webpages are in it! Maybe more! All I could access with the free sample viewer were references on page 129 to two of my sites, ""Fendick Swern's Dreamy Dreamworld"" and ""On The Hoof."" Apparently, they are numbers 248 and 249 on the list. I entered the name of another one of my sites in the search engine and a page number came up, but I was denied access to a free sample.These are just knock-off sites that I did for fun years ago--how in the world did this guy ever find them? What a mind-boggling surprise. I guess I should buy a copy of the book, huh?(I have to rate it in order to post this, so I'm giving it a mid-range ""3."")"
3,Too fast,"Mr. Bueno does too good of a job of abbreviating his narrative. Names of locations and individuals seem tossed about. He seems more intent on giving the outline of events rather than substantiate them. At times he pulls a completely unrelated subject to conclude a line of explanation. He probably though the information was interesting and decided to add it as an afterthought. Admitedly the subject matter is rather involved and he does open up, at least for me, discoveries about the earliest colonial period in Brasil and the rest of South America. His writing style lives up to his craft as a trained journalist. His portrayal of characters is flat and without much depth - but makes for lighter reading than many pedantic historians' tales. Overall, the book feels like a long article on history rather than a historical account."
2,Boring!,"This was pretty boring. Lot's of talking, not much animation, and definitely not enough to keep our three year old interested. Maybe better for someone obsessed with dinosaurs who is at least 14."
3,Not a good idea for young children,"I thought by this being an educational type video and the fact that my son watches a ton of other dinosaur movies, educational and otherwise, that he would enjoy this movie. He is actually too scared to watch it and made me turn it off within the first 10 minutes. Needless to say he hasn't watched it all the way through and I don't blame him."
3,Security Generalism,"A book that explains literally both Internet and Intranet security matters through firewalls (proxy), and other TCP/IP techniques. Good for computer know-how-ers not covering TCP/IP matters."
5,Marvelous Moosetache!,"Delightful illustrations and story. A fun tale. Sorry to see it's out of print, but fortunately many Amazon sellers have quality used copies."
1,"The man had vison, but the story dragged","What drew me to this book was the setting. I live within 10 miles of the Rocky Flats Plutonium Processing Plant. However, the story goes downhill from here. At over 300 pages, I expect a book to build to suspense. However, the book does not get going until well after page 200! (Yes, I'm a glutton for punishment)This is a story of what happens when a unnamed terrorist crashes a small airplane into the plant, and the resulting consequences. The book was written well before 9/11) Because the book takes so long to even get to this story, the detail that should be ther are minimized, almost to the point that the story was a after thought. If I could give this book zero stars, I would have."
1,S L O W and B A D,"I, too picked this book up because I live near Rocky Flats. The first 200 pages are BORING and unnecesary. Then all the action happens in a short period and the ending leaves too many unanswered questions. And it never explained how the main characters just managed to survive at the end while the rest of the area is laid to waste.I did like how the author used many Colorado town names as character names."
3,Limited LCD MOUNT,"I bought this mount becuase it was the same brand as the TV (which I am very happy with). I wanted to make sure I had the correct hardware, which I was I bought this brand. This mount will only work for you IF you studs are 16"" apart. My studs were 12"" apart on the wall I wanted to mount. The problem is that there are only holes on in the brack 16"" apart. I had to drill through the steel another hole so I could mount. I thought about taking back, but then I take a chance that a universal mount will have correct scre size. In the end, it worked out! If they could just put holes all the way around mount you would have more options. Also, once mount is mounted you cannot slide TV left to right or up and down to adjust placement on wall."
4,An Army of Children,"I actually didn't buy this book to read it. My daughter lost the book from her school library and she had to replace it. If I had to comment on anything the company I purchased it from CityBooks did an awesome job of sending the book in a very short time and the book was marked as a ""good"" copy (the shape the book was in)and it was exactly that. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Shows the poltics of Toraja art in a verrrryyyy slow and pointless way,"first off, I must say that the topic itself is not that bad, the author tries to demonstrate how the art of the Toraja people of Indonesians has been politicized (even though i disagree with her methods, she really brings too much personal emotion into her research). but i must say that the book seems to just keep on going on about something that could have been written about in half the length. she reuses the same concepts and experiences to create new chapters.....pretty disappointed"
4,Informative Book,This book was very interesting. It is very sad to think of what so many people went through because of their faith.
4,Best deal for the money!,"I just bought this camera and after the (dollar amount) reabate, I only paid (dollar amount)! It is not the best camera out there, but for (dollar amount) bucks, you can't beat it! It has many different features including auto flash, white balance, ev compensation, and red eye reduction. This camera has a 1.8"" LCD that lets you view the picture instantly. It has 8mb internal memory as well as a slot for adding external memory. The only problem I see with it is that it doesn't take great pictures in the dark. They seem a bit dusty. Overall, I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone buying a digital camera for the first time, or anyone who wants a camera to email pictures...It is truly a great buy!"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"I was given this camera in Nov 2001 as a gift. In June 2002 the monitor broke, then the camera would not turn back on, I sent it to Pentax for repair and it was sent back in Aug 2002. Same problem in Nov 2002, March 2003, July 2003 and Oct 2003. FINALLY Pentax sent me a Optio 230- I hope this one is better"
1,Don't buy Pentax Ei-100,It is bad. I only keep this camera for a week then I returned it and got the money back. It is good for boy under 6 to play with but I don't have any child so I have to return it. Sorry Pentax.
3,Always Chasing Rainbows (The Young Judy Garland),"Always Chasing Rainbows has something for everyone. I am a huge fan of Judy Garland, especially her singing voice. You have your slow, romantic songs, your faster paced dance songs, and of course, Over the Rainbow. One of my favorites is It Never Rains But What It Pours, because I think everybody can relate to it some time or another. Wether you are in the mood for something slow, or something up beat and fun, this cd has it all. I would absolutely recommend it to any and every Judy Garland fan."
2,Messed Up Old Queens will like this one!!,"This movie is perfect if you want to feel bad about being gay and have low self esteem. If you can relate to any part of this movie, seek help now. While one might appreciate certain acting and theatrical aspects of this movie, it depicts exactly what the current right wing wants the world to think about gay people.I have never spoken to anyone who has watched this movie and felt good afterwards."
4,where is the DVD version???,"This is an amazing performance of an extraordinary piece of theatrical art and history. It deserves remastering and release on DVD!Some gay people have complained that the script is homophobic, but I think it documents the subtleties (and not-so-subtle features) of internalized homophobia. And it is a play that is beautifully composed, a wonderful part of our gay cultural heritage."
5,Two words: Leonard Frey,"There are any number of reasons to see ""The Boys in the Band,"" but I can think of none better than Leonard Frey's performance. One of the few screen performances that are truly mesmerizing, please give it a shot -- film acting of the highest caliber."
1,Boys in the Band,There was no movie on it just credits. Tried playing on several DVD players and no movie. Since I opened it I could not return it. Totally disappointed in this purchase.
4,A Classic,"People have been waiting for this movieto come out on dvd for years and years.I personally got fed up and transferredmy vhs copy onto a blank dvd so that atleast it wouldn't deteriorate any further.I'm glad I did.because I think we will haveto wait till hell freezes over before wesee it on dvd.I also copied Cruising andagain I'm glad I did.Even though I'm a 60 yr.old female.I thinkthis movie is truly a classic,because itshows us all how far we have come.Thank God !!!BRING IT OUT ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!"
5,NEED DVD,Why hasn't this been released on DVD? I know at least three of my friends who want this in their collection.
4,"Great Play, excellent movie adaptation","I was at first trying to look for a movie for research purposes for a scene study I was in.Not about homosexuality but about the people of that time...I happen to stumble upon this movie although its a dvd version but with a vhs quality.That didnt bother me ,I enjoyed watching the movie adaptation of the play ,it was great.A couple of the actors are really homosexual and has unfortunately passed on from complications of the virus .It gets quite intense but I got glued on to it ,neglected my other duties,and finished watching it.I would love to see it as a play and meet the actors."
5,Boys in the Band,"I loved this movie. I saw it along time ago and had been looking for it. It finally came out on DVD I watched it four times when I first got it. It was humerous, sad, and fun"
5,Great Flick - Still Relevant and not Dated!,This was my coming out flick on first date! It was nice seeing it decades later! Great print and great extras!
1,Not meant for a DS Lite,"The graphics were awful. You are better off getting a DSi and downloading Dr. Mario Express for only $5. The game is still my favorite of all time, but not meant for a DS Lite."
1,"Looks the same, plays worse.","There were only a couple NES games I ended up playing after new consoles kept coming out. Dr. Mario was one of them. This game doesn't live up to the original. It pretty much looks the same, and it sounds the same, but here are the problems that keep me from playing it: The game isn't smooth like the original. Remember those tricky situations where you would have to slide a pill under other pills while flipping it? Forget it. Holding left and right is slower than the original, and flipping is slower as well. Finally, a minor problem is that when you hold down a pill to make it fall faster, the yellow turns into red as it falls. The pills are too small. They should make a Dr. Mario for DS with the double screens..Heaven."
4,Gee....,"If you like puzzle games similar to Tetris, then Dr. Mario is right up your alley.Dr. Mario contains 20 levels of virus-bustin' difficulty.The game is a simple 4-in-a-row type of puzzler. Back then, it was pretty unique and was thought of being obviously inspired by Tetris.It's a really addicting puzzle game, but things are even more fun on the Game Boy because of its portability.However, the Game Boy Advance port of the NES title is more expensive than the original versions (Counting Game Boy)Since there's already a Game Boy version, which is about 6 bucks less than this port, you should go get that instead."
5,Beautiful Product - two tone brown,"This is a quality product and works and looks wonderful on my English saddle. One note - the front and back are a very dark brown, but the sides are a lighter brown. I used leather stain to stain the sides to match, and it came out perfectly. I love it!"
5,Best in the series,"This dvd is probably the best in the series of musical journeys by Naxos. I have a lot of them, but I watch this one the most often. It is full of beautiful scenery, castles, stately homes, and interesting glimpses of Scottish life (including a weaving mill, a brewery, and a bagpipe ""band""). Several pastoral scenes with farm animals are included also. The videography is very good (better than some of the other titles in the series). It is very enjoyable and relaxing to watch. The music is lovely as well."
5,Pocket Protector- Vinyl,"I had looked everywhere to find these Pocket Protectors and I told my wife that I had visited my last store looking for these protectors. I said I am going on line and see if Amazon has them, and there they were. My wife said she was not aware that you handled anything like that. I told her if Amazon did not have them,then no one would.I could have saved a lot of time and miles of looking if I had tried Amazon first.I have ordered them again so I would have some backups.Thanks Amazon for being there for me.Roger D. Hobble"
5,Excellent!,These pocket protectors work great and they look crisp! I am now the talk of the lab with these! I know where I'll be going if I ever need more!
5,Just as expected!,A hard to find item but wonderful for an engineer to be. Just the perfect thing in which to tuck my grandson's gift card.
3,must be color blind,"its only a pocket protector but white is white even in the picture, but when they arrive the product is clear"
4,Need more colors,"I think these will do the job in a pinch, but there's just no pizazz. With a little creativity and a few colored markers, though, these are a great addition to my clear vinyl polo shirts on casual Fridays. With these babies close to my heart, I haven't had to deal with sloshing ink in months. Thanks, Esselte! (and Amazon)"
2,How much did Miller Lite pay for advertising for this video?,"I am a Health/PE teacher and bought this video to show students. We use teams of 3 or 4 and I wanted the students to see the strategy of forearm, set, attack, and block on each play that you see in beach volleyball. I was dismayed when almost every shot had advertising for Miller Lite in it. As a health teacher, I cannot promote alcohol in any way. I was able to use only one segment - the world championship between USA and Brazil."
1,15 bucks for one tiny bag!,"When I was buying the bag, I didn't realize it would be so tiny. When the envelope arrived, I was perplexed. Oh, well, I am using it, and it is nice. Too much $$$ for a bag though."
4,Helpful but not explicit,"I'd say this is a 3-star book, but I can't figure out how to go back and change the ""star rating"".Joe's book provides a lot of insight into targeting big trout with flies (nymphs primarily). The experienced nymphing fisherman will understand it, and get a lot out of it. If you're not experienced at nymphing, this is not a primer on how to start. For those fly tiers that like to work from a standard ""recipe"", this book is really lacking. You'll have to use a lot of imagination creating the flies he describes, based on his sketchy descriptions. He doesn't talk at all about ""terminal tackle"" either. There are many ways to rig up the terminal end of nymphing set-up. He leaves that a mystery, on which techniques he uses with greatestsuccess."
2,not worth the money,"Product was shipped in plastic bag so opened before noticing that this set of cutters should not have gotten through quality assurance at the plant, one tip of the cutter seemed to have been accidentally blunted during manufacture.I was intending to use these to clip guitar strings after installing a new set, but cutting surfaces were not hard enough to cut one set of strings without putting some serious gaps in them.So I would only recommend for cutting soft materials. I love my 20 year old Xcelite pliers and cutters but will avoid their products in the future."
3,"Not bad, not great","This phone had been recommended to me by a manager at Office Depot, so I gave it a try. I'm rather particular about phone quality, as part of my business involves extended phone conversations with clients. I've decided to return it, preferring my old 900MHz Panasonic, but for some this phone might be fine.What I liked:-Very good, clear sound quality (at both ends)--better than the 5.8MHz Panasonics I tried-Nice ""Do Not Disturb"" lighted button (for turning off all ringers)-Lighted keypadWhat I didn't like:-Low volume (on my end--my clients could hear me fine)-Intermittent background buzz (especially with a headset)"
2,Waste of Money,"What made me purchase this phone: low price.Why I made a mistake: Caller ID rarely works... only shows up about 15% of the time, showing ""NO DATA"" most of the time.I made a mistake and should have checked reviews first. I would not recommend this phone to anyone, unless they a) need a cheap multi-handset phone and b) do not have, or care about, caller id"
3,Thomson 6.0 DECT Triple Handset System,"Overall, a decent phone that has really good reception anywhere in the house, and isn't affected by interference from our wireless router, microwave, cell phones, etc. However, the display is VERY difficult to read, as the blue backlight overpowers any of the text displayed. As far as I can tell, we have tried adjusting the contrast / brightness, but the only way to really see the text is to look at the phone from up above the display or down below. It's really kind of awkward that way."
1,"I want a ""safe"" bottle, not one made in China","With all the recent coverage on how China does not regard our safety in the least, I find it incredible that a product designed to keep us away from plastics and ""safe"" is made in China.I'm getting a SIGG bottle...made in Switzerland. I will not support a country that could care less if my family is safe or not!"
3,Metallic taste/smell,"When I first received the bottle, I washed it twice but the water seemed to have a metallic taste, whether I drank from the bottle or poured it into a cup, and there was a strong metallic smell when drinking from the bottle. I contacted the manufacturer and they said they haven't heard too many complaints about that...I must just be ""sensitive"". So, I tried washing again and mixing some powdered drinks directly in the bottle. The metallic taste is now gone if I pour the water into a cup, but the smell is still there when drinking from the bottle. I've also purchased a couple of the bottles with the sports caps. I don't notice the metallic smell or taste with those, so it may just be something with my cap."
4,"Good, could be even better","The information and the way it is delivered are excellent, except for one most annoying problem: There are cover to cover acronyms and, unless one is reading from cover to cover, one is bound to come up against an acronym which means nothing to one! (And so, presumably, to one or two, or more, others). The book is heavy (pounds weight) but would more expansive elucidation of these abbreviations be a waste of resources? If so, a glossary of these time wasting distractions needs to be appended."
4,Ride the Downward Spiral..,"I always imagined that someone in the world of reality TV would actually attempt what this movie chronicles - a filmmaker capturing the activities of a depraved serial killer. Well, obviously there'd be some moral concerns (rightly so) with the concept, but this movie also explores what else you'd find on that particular downward spiral. Highly suspenseful and engrossing, you can't help but feel trapped, much like the main character in the film, played convincingly well by Wes Bentley. I had the opportunity to watch this one on the independent circuit and was surprised. A strong debut for this up-and-coming director. If you want to be a bit disturbed, this will do it for you."
2,Not as good as has been reviewed on this page 2 & 1/2 stars,It was an original story but the acting and screenplay were not worthy of more than a 2 and a half star rating. The story progressed methodically and the acting was not very good. I think the lead actor could develop into a good actor but in this film he is too green. I really did not like this one too much and would only recommend it as one that you watch for free on a movie channel.
4,Not what I thought I was renting...,"I rented this movie and put off watching for awhile, I wasn't even sure if I would make time for it. I;m glad I did!! This movie is dark and disturbing, and it goes through the main poor decisions twice, so the audience can see exactly how a serial killer, hunts and kills. He did open up about his terribly abusive mother, whose memory haunts him and his sister, but I'm not sure if the sister was beaten like the son was. He chooses slim, dark haired women, guess who they look like? Dear old mom. By the way, how did hi mom's life end? When did it? This movie opens with and a shock and ends with one."
2,Not worth it...,"I still can't figure out why Wes Bentley of ""American Beauty"" stardom has relegated himself to films that barely make it to a public audience. While this film may feature good production quality, fine acting, and an attempt at a new perspective...it ultimately fails in all respects. Not even good acting can make this film interesting or plausible, it's entirely skeletal in its plot line."
3,Astrological Trading Ideas,"Those without detailed astrological knowledge are sure to have trouble with such concepts as ""Mercury changing speed"", ""Mercury speed in geo longitude of 59'"", ""Venus Helio Latitude at 0 degrees"", ""Mars and Venus in perihelion"", ""Mercury/Mars speed differential of 59'"" and ""Jupiter declination"" which the author does not explain to the uninitiated. He also discusses several other tenets already extensively covered in other texts, namely, that in commodity markets the opening price is usually the high or low of the day about 80% of the time, and that a 3 wave Fibonacci .618 retracement is a reliable trading method. I see that Pesavento has another title devoted solely to the opening price so don't buy this one for that purpose. For astrological indicators, I think his book Astro Cycles, The Traders' Viewpoint is much better especially since it does a decent explanation of the nature and meaning of astrological aspects, suitable for the uninformed."
4,Fun wheels!,"This is a fun sand toy-definitely the most ""active"" one I have for my toddlers, meaning that it moves and is safe for them to play with (it's hard to find that when you've got really young ones). They love watching the wheels spin when I sprinkle the sand into it.Not that this needs to be said, but I'll just add: the sand has to be completely dry for it to work! ;D"
2,Way too pricey,"This is a really fun and sturdy toy. My 2-year old loves playing with it both in sand and in water. I was very disappointed, however, to see an almost identical item at our local store for only $2.99."
4,Fun sand and water toy,"My 2 year old enjoys playing with this fun sand and water toy. I think, it was a good buy, that I can recommend."
5,Sharon,The kids spend hours in the sandbox with these toys. I bought one for each child so they don't fight over it.
5,Don't pass this up!,"I read David's other children's book, ""Voss: How I come to America and am Hero, Mostly"" and loved it, which lead me to Scrib. Again, David Ives delivered. This is a great Western tale that draws the reader in with the author's subtle yet commanding use of regional dialect. I don't know why more people haven't read this book, it's great. The Western accent used by the author isn't cheesy or over done, it's just kinda there. When you first start reading the book you won't notice it much, but by the end of the book you'll find the voice in head is completely western. For all that this book is supposed to be (e.g. a quick read, with humor embedded in quirky language) this book is great. Don't pass this up!"
1,Genuine disappointment,"I have a great deal of respect for Marion Zimmer Bradley as an author, especially for The Mists of Avalon. Therefore, after reading this gobbler I could hardly believe they were written by the same person. The character development is virtually nonexistent, the dialogue-really, the writing style in general- is clanky, and the plot seems to be little more than a frame for sex scenes. The ending also comes across as rather too convenient. It's a shame that Bradley, who has created strong female protagonists in other works, never really allows Sara Latimer to grow much or make a firm demonstration of her personal strength. In short, pass on this book."
2,Not up to par...,"I have read a good many of this author's works, and while there is certainly some good narrative here, the book seems to loose focus somewhere in the middle and never quite gain it back. It is not up to Mrs. Bradley's normally high standard."
1,Such a disappointment,"I have thoroughly enjoyed other books MZB has written, so when I picked up ""Witch Hill"", I was expecting a great story. Boy, was I disappointed.Also, living in and around the witchy community here in Massachusetts, I have to say that it's books like this one that give the real witch's a bad name. It's stories like this, and others in the media that stir up negative and fearful emotions towards the peaceful, nature loving witch's of today.However, fiction being what it is, even as a story, this book is just horrible. There is aweful character development, and immediately you are thrown into a highly sexual situation without even really understanding how you got there.If you like hot and sweaty sex with no real story behind it, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a good story, run screaming away from this book. And the only reason I gave it one star, is because you can't give it none."
1,Baaaaaaaad,This book is so bad that it would be a waste to burn it. Giving it 1 star is being extremely generous. I was thoroughly disappointed because I am a fan of her writing.
1,I actually haven't read this version...,"But the same story appears in Heartlight, book 4 in the ""'Light"" paranormal series. If your going to read this series, start with Ghostlight instead. _Then_ read Witchlight, Gravelight and finally Heartlight. The first half is a prequel to the first three, folllowing up to just prior to Ghostlight, where a possibly condensed version of Witch Hill is told from the protagonist's (Colin) view and procedes on to the 'heart' of the Heartlight story."
3,It was...interesting....,"I'm a fan of MZB, but this book was just- different. I felt that it definitely was rather risque, and believe that it definitely has some chapters that are just pure porn, which is unlike MZB. I think it's very pro-sexuality. The plot gets a little bit odd, and is sort of cut off, but is not impossible to follow. It starts out well, but about halfway through goes sour. I really wish it had been better, and I enjoyed it even though it was absolutely nothing like what I expected. I just wouldn't expect something like that out of MZB. She's usually different."
2,A Bit Confusing....,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I picked up this book but I certainly didn't expect what I read. I figured it was a love story with a sort-of-plot thrown in about witchcraft. Boy was I wrong. I suppose if I'd known what I was about to read I wouldn't have disliked the book so much but I don't know...something about it just didn't all click together. Of course, this is my first ever MZB book and I haven't heard anything about her so I'm giving the book 2 stars because of my obvious lack of knowledge about these kind of books."
2,Not proffessional,"It works ok but the connection to the Archos screen was not stable. I had to tape them together. Price is way too high for the supported capabilities. Recorded video quality is not very good. For some reason I had a lot of color mismatch (colors seem to flucuate constantly, especially at the beginning of the recording).I do not recommend it."
1,not as described......,"When I received the unit I was very excited to put it to use. I was a bit concerned when I opened the package and the unit wasn't in an Arcos labled package. It was in a small zip-lock type bag that came along with the necessary cable. I went back online to look at the picture shown and what I received was half the sizeof what is shown online and lacked labels for the power and video input/outputs. After inspecting the unit, I noticed that the locking mechanism was loose and bent. Although it works, I do get some ""video break-up"" lines every now and then. Needless to say I'm a little upset that I've received it in this manner. When I ordered the unit, I had just left for a couple of months. So this has been sitting around for a while before I had gotten time to look at it. I'm hoping that 2 months later that NewMp3Technology will be willing to replace the unit."
2,Travel adaptor?,"I bought the travel adaptor for the 404's. It does charge the unit very well if you have the DVR which comes with the AC adaptor. I have had no success with recording directly from a regular TV, how many hotel rooms have a VCR or DVD player? It looks like the travel adaptor has to be jacked into a player with a video out. I have been able to record off a plasma screen TV only because it does have a video out. It is useless for play back on the TV. and in truth you do not NEED the travel adaptor to play back. If you want to play back just get the replacement cable/jack, jack into the head phone out on the 404, jack into the the video and audio in on your TV/VCR... hit the LCD/TV button on the side of the 404 and watch your video. All and all I think this is a waste of money, the DVR station does work and is pretty small, comes with the AC adaptor, cables and works as advertised."
3,Archos DVR Travel Adaptor,"Having purchased the above I was slightly disappointed with what it said on the box (and with yet again with more wires to my collection). After trying several different digital cameras (Sanyo C5 and Sony cybershot) this devise will work with the cybershot and not the Sanyo C5. I yet to see how it will work with my other camers and VCR - I think it will with the appropriate wires, and various connections and a bit of patience. I was looking for something to put my old analogue videos onto my computer and I think this may just be the thing (first put the videos on my archos and then load them on my computer) instead of buying another device for that purpose. As with most things one has to make several attempts before one finds the appropriate device that works for them."
4,Good read and a good dose of common sense,"The Kennedy's provide a well-needed dose of sanity for 1990's America. The chapters of the book would stand on their own easily and each is worth the price of the book. If you liked Limbaugh's, ""The Way Things Ought To Be"", you'll like this book."
5,CW,"Once again the Kennedy Brothers have written an outstanding piece that should be required reading in our History and Sociology classes. What makes their writing unique is that they not only have summations with questions and answers as if being presented with questioned by an outsider, but they also have a good amount of references for further research.An outstanding book, easy to read and solid material. I highly recomed it."
1,Less Than Fresh,"This best thing about THE PASSING is PAUL GLEASON, the great curmudgeonly character actor best known as Principal Vernon in THE BREAKFAST CLUB.The bad thing is Mr. Gleason passed away in 2006, which means your ""new movie"" is less than fresh.The promising ""House on Haunted Hill""-style main plot of three obnoxious rich kids must spent the weekend in creepy old mansion in order to collect an inheritance quickly fizzles down to being just plain obnoxious.A cast of thoroughly forgettable and irritating characters, shoddy special effects and a meandering script that drags on endlessly make THE PASSING rather like the passing of black stool. It smells bad, it hurts to get through and it feels like it's never going to end.Patrick - ScreamQueenz Horror Blog"
3,This book has been superseded by 'The Terror Conspiracy'.,"Jim Marrs has published a new book ""The Terror Conspiracy"", incorporating ""Inside Job"" along with a lot of new material. ""Inside Job"" is now out of print although some copies may still be in circulation. In any event, everything in ""Inside Job"" is in ""The Terror Conspiracy"", updated, expanded and in the context of a much wider ranging book.""The Terror Conspiracy"" is available now for immediate shipping."
3,Contains some truth but goes over the top,"I ordered this book expecting to find a well documented alternative take on what transpired on 9/11. While this book offers some interesting theories, I can't accept all that it puts on the table. I do happen to believe 9/11 was an inside job but this book is just too 'out-there' for me. The author tries to make the case for the pentagon being struck by a missile of some sort and also tries to convince the reader that there weren't even any hijackers on the planes that crashed into the world trade center but rather that they were remote-controlled. If you believe these claims then I guess this is the book for you but like I said this book presents ideas that are just too outrageous for me to believe."
1,To believe this you have to be either a Nut or a Liberal,For all you nut jobs that gave this book a good score I pitty your hatred for the administration. There have been many episodes on the discovery channel that deal with what really happened. Even Penn and Teller on their show (who are anti government libertarians) express their views with facts against the radical conspiracy theories. You can watch it on google video.If it were a demolition then why were the steel beams glowing red with heat and smoldering hours after the destruction. Thats not a characteristic of demolition. Its no use stating the facts when the radical left will just ignore them like they do with every other fact.
1,More research needed.,"Mr. Marrs, the jets were not scrambled from the wrong locations. The jets were scrambled from the ONLY locations! Our former embarrassement to decmocracy, Bill Clinton, closed many military installations thoughout our country leaving us defenseless. The second airplane would have been brought down if the airforce base in New Jersey wasn't closed by the Clinton administation. I think it is very important to question our government and investigate this matter but unfortunetly this falsehood limits Mr. Marr's credibility."
2,Sounded good in nineteen-seventy-whatever,"Now...not so good. If you're still into this type of thing (Robert Plant having a seizure vocals, heavy guitar, cowbell, long, meandering songs, pretentious '70's hard rock lyrics), hey this ranks right up there. Take the worst of Deep Purple and Mountain and add a singer that sounds like Ronnie James Dio crossed with a billy goat and you get Family. For '70's hard rock completists only."
3,Difficult to continue reading,"This book, though perceived valuable by a few other readers, is a tough book to get through. It is such a slow read that I couldn't read it carefully and thoughtfully after the first hundred pages - I simply skimmed the rest. There are many many many other behavioral books that use real-world stories to get the point across that there are different types of employees, bosses, leaders. This book does it in a repetitious and slow fashion, causing me, the reader, to have to set the book down after less than an hour of reading because of how boring and difficult the metaphors and wording was to read completely through. Not only was the authors writing difficult and not to the point, but the mention of dolphin, carp, shark scattered throughout this book was just plain boring. It may have a good lesson, but so do other, more enjoyable books."
1,"Speaker is a joke, terrible battery life","I bought this unit solely for the built in speaker. The speaker is totally useless, with it 2' away from ear in a silent room, speaker distorts before it is loud enough to hear. Battery life is pathetic. Size is way to bulky for 512mb unit at 0.8""x1.3""x3.8"". First time in pocket depressed buttons and battery door fell off. Does perform basic function although it resets to beginning each time it's turned on. Only positive is that it will plug directly into USB without special cable or adaptor, it did come with a USB cable and headphones that double as FM antenna, although it only seemed to bring in 1 station weekly and it was not one of the stronger local stations."
5,Amazingly entertaining game that looks complex but isn't,"I purchased this game after playing for a few weeks with a group at work on our lunch breaks. I was able to get my 9 year old daughter into it in less than 30 minutes and all my kids love it! We play games with a group of family and friends a few times a month and after introducing it to them, they started asking where we got it. It is a great little strategy game with a myriad of possibilities and endless replayability."
3,Barbadian Insight,"This video was not expected. I was looking for a concert video. If you are a big fan of Rihanna and want to know more about her, here is your opportunity to get a large dose. Overall, the video is informative and entertaining."
2,hard to clean; buckle too low,"In order to take the cover off to clean it, the entire seat must be taken out, including the 5-point harness and the armrests. When putting together the seat, the armrests just snap into place - but I'm unable to remove them yet. Next car seat will have an easily removeable cover.Also, I agree that the buckle is too low."
1,I do not recommend,"We recently bought 2 of these seats for our daughters age 4 and 3. Both girls are small for their age (10th percentile on growth charts). The harness buckle that comes between their legs is too big. When they wear shorts or dresses, the buckle and its strap cuts into their legs. Again, these are tiny little legs. I would not recommend this seat to anyone. We paid $110 each and quickly recycled the boxes. We have little hope of a refund or exchange."
3,"ok, but not for tall babies...","I bought this carseat thinking I could use it for at least 3 years but that is not the case. My son is very tall for his age (38 inches at 18 months) and this seat has a 40 inch height restriction. I enjoyed the seat when he was an infant, I didn't have issues with belts twisting or anything like that. It is a great seat if your childe fits the 'normal' heights for age."
4,I love this carseat,I just love this carseat and so does my son. My son loves how high it sits so he can look out all the windows. This carseat is very easy to use and I just love the easy adjustable straps. It is very easy to loosen the straps if needed (for winter coats) and to tighten back when it gets warmer. I have never had a problem with this carseat.
3,Belt adjustment button is not working well.,"We bought this for our son who is 9 months now but is one year old size. He seems comfortable in this seat. We liked it a lot for a week but after a week the belt adjustment button started working funny. It sometimes works and sometimes doesn't work well. It drove us crazy when it was not working well. So today we went to BabiesRus to return it but we couldn't return it because we didn't keep the box. Walmart and other many stores give refund without box when the product has problem. But not Babies R Us!! So after a little arguing, they exchange it with another same model carseat. It works fine now but I am not sure how long it will work well."
2,Deceived parent!,When I first purchased this car seat for my son he was fine. He is now 2 years old and can wiggle his arms out but at the same time if he wears a sweater or jacket the harness is too tight! I've had this car seat 1 year now and I still can't get it to work right.
2,Just too frustrating,The incessant jumping and being knocked down everytime by flying bats is enough to drive even the most mild mannered of gamers stark raving mad. Do not buy if you want a casual waste of time only buy if you are hardcore and enjoy challenges that are near impossible.
3,"Old school fun, but very hard to master","Bought this game upon recommendation from a friend. This game dates from the era where hand-eye was king. Most games today make the gameplay easy, but to extend gameplay time they add more content. Caslevania has little content, so to extend gameplay they require skill. Believe me, if you beat it, you are some kind of awesome. I never even got past the first level."
4,A less expensive idea...,"Yes, this is a top pick double-cd gem. And if you want them to take your $45 and run, go for it.If you want the best two songs from these two cds, let me suggest a way to save some money. The exact same spacey, long version of Fly Like An Eagle (11:32) is also on Classic Rock Live (along with about a dozen other classics from various groups). The smooth flowing version of The Window (6:09) is on the Steve Miller ""Extended Versions"" cd, along with an 8:44 long version of Living In The USA and lots more.... for a lot less.Enjoy."
4,Steve Miller live,"I've always enjoyed Steve Miller's band and music, I've never heard this live compilation album from the king biscuit flower hour before. Decent recording for a live event and he sounds awesome in the recordings. Very happy I picked this up."
5,Cute book,I taught kindergarten and bought this book because a coworker had it and it was very cute. Great way to let the kids search for letters.
3,For I Spy Fans,This book is like an I Spy alphabet. The book goes in alphabetical order. Each picture has several letters hidden in the picture. Throughout the book they are building a tree house. It's a great book for I Spy fans.
3,Average,"I would recommend the Internet Galaxy to a person who is conducting or going to conduct a research about the Internet because the author provides tons of information in depth which could be a good background for that person. This could be a huge source of reference as well. Some chapter is interesting such as the Culture of the Internet that let us know more about the characteristic of network society (some context you can just skip it). Some chapter is up to date and it may refer to the current issue such as Digital Divide or is the Internet the end of privacy? You may find an answer here. Some chapter is too redundant and not necessary to know for some students. For someone who is really interested in what the Internet impacts us, this book could raise some points for you to further think or question about. However, if you just want to know superficially what the Internet is or what it is used nowadays I suggest to find another easy-reading Internet dummy book."
2,The Internet Galaxy by Manuel Castells,"This was a requirement for a graduate course I recently took. Basically, I think this book was very uninteresting to read and I would not recommend it to others. At any point in a college degree, I think 90% of the information Mr. Castells provides is elementary. Most students know a lot of this information coming into college, much less this late in our college career. There were only a select number of things that I did not know previously, none of which will be beneficial to my degree or career. Furthermore, I also think Mr. Castells's writing was very dry and repetitious, which made it even harder to read. Overall, there were very few benefits to reading this book and many downfalls."
2,A bunch of common sense,"After reading through Internet Galaxy by Manuel Castells all I got out of it was some fancy lingo. There are so many new tech terms in this book that it was hard to understand at times. I am sure that this is great research and it is a well written book, but I got very little out of it. For the most part it was common sense and repetitive. If I were looking for something to put me to sleep or new nothing about the internet I would read this book."
2,A good book for someone with little knowledge of technology,"I read this book for a graduate class and was very displeased. There is a lot of useful information but it just seems like it's a little trivial for graduate studies. Most of the things in the book are common sense and the author goes on and on discussing them. I would recommend this book to a high school technology class or maybe a basic college course in technology, but definitely not for graduate studies. Castells is very knowledgeable but can become very cumbersome in his writing."
1,Not worth the time,"I cannot say that I learned much about the Internet through this book. The book was too simplistic for a regular Internet user. The generalizations were repeated over and over throughout the chapters, which made the book fairly boring. Also, the information in the chapters was commonsense based information. If anyone has any knowledge about the Internet, this book is not for you. Most high schoolers could probably give you the answers to the questions approached by Castells. This book is not worth the price paid, I am sorry I ever bought it."
4,Internet Galaxy,"Much of what Manuel Castells addressed in his book, The Internet Galaxy, represents a new breakthrough idea that the Internet plays an important role in our society. Basically, this should be a technology issue that most readers are familiar with, but he can use his knowledge including with his incredible talent to generate the linkage between the technological basis and social, philosophical perspective. There is a lot of useful information combined together in each chapter through this book. If any interested readers are ready to develop their views and mindsets with the analyzed understandings of the influence of the Internet, I believe that this book should be considered to be another valuable asset for them to keep."
2,Internet Gallaxy,"This book had some parts that made you look at the internet and technology in a way that you normally would not. It provided a framework for the analysis of some technologies and how they impact your life. The problem was that these parts were too scarce.In between the parts that really made you think, were long sections that were painfully dry. At times the author seemed to try to give himself credibility by displaying his vocabulary. It is very impressive, I would hate to play scrabble against him, but it does not make for good reading."
3,Castells' book review,"Castells' book ""The Internet Galaxy"" is hard for me to follow, since the information and terminologies that he used is somewhat like foreign language to me, it difficult for me to grasp the view that he tried to address. In his book there are two areas regarding the issue on the ""Hackers"" and ""Privacy"" topics are fascination for me, which help me more cautious when using the Internet that request my personal information. Over all I think he did a fair work on provided the information regard Internet aspect and how its impact our daily life."
2,Internet Galaxy,"Overall I found this book to be moderately thought provoking but for the most part pretty dry. The chapters on the history and the digital divide were the most interesting chapters in the book in that they are fact based. This book is geared towards those who want to know about the effects of the Internet on society, future, past, and present. I think most people take for granted that the Internet is a part of our lives. This book opens your eyes about what the intent of the innovations were."
3,Castells Internet Galaxy,"Castells' book ""The Internet Galaxy - Reflections on the Internet, Business, and Society"" does exactly that. He explores the history of the internet and many aspects of its development through the year 2001 (the publication date of the book). The writing is technical enough at times to confuse the average reader but nothing that requires knowledge of a computer language. He discusses businesses around the globe and how they've influenced the development of the internet, and offers an explanation for the dot com craze and the stock market crash that followed. He covers the impact of the internet on society and the impact of society on the internet, including racial and global distribution percentages and reflections on each of those figures. Readers should be aware that Castells talks about other works alot and uses difficult wording throughout the entire book. Reading can be painstaking at times; however each chapter contains thought provoking material."
3,Interesting Reflections on the Internet,"There were several areas from Castell's book that were thought provoking and key for individuals to understand regarding our networked society today. It provided a good overview on the Internet and the impact on our society. Some parts of the book were better than others but that probably reflects my personal areas of interests. I particularly enjoyed the sections regarding digital divide and security. Overall, the book provided good information and was thought provoking."
3,Some Interesting Information,"There were several areas from Castell's book that were thought provoking and key for individuals to understand regarding our networked society today. It provided a good overview on the Internet and the impact on our society. Some parts of the book were better than others but that probably reflects my personal areas of interests. I particularly enjoyed the sections regarding digital divide and security. Overall, the book provided good information and was thought provoking."
3,Castells' book ok,"Castells' book ""The Internet Galaxy"" is a book that is good but not great. The book starts out with a really good explanation of the history of the Internet and different cultures that are involved with the Internet. After this though there are a few interesting things in the middle chapters, but the end of the book is pretty lame. The end of the book is pretty lame because it has a lot of commonsense statements and statistics that are not very interesting."
4,Nifty little album of songs,"I just discovered Jessie Matthews a few days ago via [...], and thought I'd give one of her albums a try. Glad I did.Although few, if any, of the songs on this cd re enduring standards, I've found each one a delight, not only becauseof the charm with which Miss Matthews sings them, but because of the rich background orchestrations.Great for listening to while driving around town. A real cheerful little earful, as well as a chanceto listen to what folks back in the 1930's were listening to before the war came and changed so much."
2,"Tough Going, Not At All Like ""The Children's Book""","Having enjoyed my first A. S. Byatt book (""The Children's Book""), purchased this and its 2 sequels hoping to reprise the experience. Started with the first of the trilogy, ""The Virgin in the Garden"" and found it extremely tough to read. The edition I got has print that seems to get ever smaller as the paragraphs got longer, and while well-written and terribly erudite (as one would expect from the author), it's a tough, tough read. It's slow, things don't really connect, and I hate to say, I finally gave up after about 100 pages. Maybe this means I am just too ignorant and too common to appreciate her writing but it was disappointing. I flipped through the 2 sequels which only seemed to get weirder so donated all three to my laundry room library."
2,A letdown,"She obviously knows how to write. However, I didn't like or identify, or find interesting any of the characters. In addition she is very good at spouting out allusions, but most of them hindered the plot development instead of helping it.After reading this I did not read the sequels."
1,"I have no idea what ""Virgin"" is all about,","except to sell books. I cannot identify with any of the characters. Incredibly outlandish (another reviewer said ""unpredictable"" -- a real understatement). I picked the book up a discount retailer after thumbing through it. Set in Yorkshire, England, 1952/1953, it provided me memories of Robin's Hood Bay (the hike); the names of all the plants (interestingly, gorse was never mentioned -- did I miss that one?); and the petit point hassocks for the pews at St Bartholomew's. Hmmmm.At the time Virginia Woolf's ""Mrs Dalloway"" was published, a critic said it would not be read in 50 years. I can't imagine ""The Virgin in the Garden"" being read 50 years from now, but with sequels, etc., it appears the author is hoping for lucrative movie deals, ala Harry Potter."
2,brutal going,"there's no music, as it were, in what a.s. byatt does: i have read three of her novels now and i'm, i think, in a pretty good position to judge her stuff as utterly pretentious and banal. read just one page of hers and compare it to a paragraph (a single sentence?!) of James Joyce. i am an english prof--hence all the lit allusions in this novel just kinda made me sick. she drops so many names/quotations you need an imaginary broom to sweep them away. dreadful dreck. you need something Englishy to read--investigate William Boyd or Julian Barnes. byatt is like a parody of good writing. only salman rushdie's fiction is more onanistic (though his criticism's pretty cool). byatt is the literary equivalent of Stevie Nicks! Icky!!!!"
1,not very useful,"This book contains little but a diary of one mother's experience -- it seems pretty amateurish and not at all worth the $$$. I highly recommend ""Mother Of The Groom: Everything You Need to Know to Enjoy the Best Wedding Ever"" as a much more comprehensive and professional guidebook for women who need good guidance for their son's wedding."
2,Very (maybe overly) sophisticated analysis,Readers of this book should be familiar with sophisticated philosophic language and concepts. It uses too many multisyllable philosophy oriented words that are beyond my (twice college graduated-BS and MBA) capacity.
2,mixed review,good: different style of pin-up art mixing renaissance style and modern poses in high qualitybad: this is a magazine and not a paperback; the cover and pages are very thin and crease with casual flipping; SQP publishing can do better; if you are a Girotto fan go on-line and seek out the hardback version though pricey
2,Self-Promotion,"Eddie Coleman completely uses this book to promote his Ad agency. He talks more about advertising than Mastery. One good statistic he uses is his conversion rate. Other than that, if you are not a DP, don't bother."
1,"A $30 advertisement, folks, that's it","I'm an experienced Internet sales director and I have to agree with the other reviewer that this book is nothing more than a thinly-veiled ad for Mr. Coleman's services. There were only a few useful nuggets of information dispersed throughout a 300-page diatribe of how effective his far-eastern, pschographic (?) principles of persuasion are. He even spends considerable time getting you ready for the explosion of business you will recieve once applying these principles to your department. Right. Very little, if any, actual instruction accompanies his psychobabble in this awkwardly organized book--I guess that's what we need to pay him for. Honestly, it's somewhat insulting. Save your money. BTW - one of these reviews HAD to be written by (or inspired by) the author himself."
3,Mostly metaphors.,"The books wasn't bad. There were many good factoids that are valuable. They could be summarized into a few pages. There were a lot of metaphors that took up the bulk of the text and I disliked that. Aside from personal taste, the author isn't bad. It is worth the $20 or so it took to buy it if you are unable to find some of the industry statistics you are looking for on google, or don't have experience with the topics the metaphors cover."
1,Infomercial form of a book,"If you think Ron @ Ronco adds to the quality of TV viewing, then you'll think Coleman is a literary genius. Otherwise, stay clear and find some actual sales experts. Eddie Coleman is all hype - his company name is Hyperdrive, maybe that's why. Once the hype wears off, there is no substance. I know, I've met him a few times within auto industry circles. If you don't already know (either instinctively or from even very limited experience) the basic information put forth in this poorly written book, then you should possibly consider not even being in sales."
2,Don't Think This Guy Has Ever Sold Cars,"I've worked Internet car sales for a few years and I've always made a living, even during the Recession. A good book is short and to the point. This isn't it. Not enough of the meat I need to close deals and work with the guy who wants to buy a car below invoice. The author comes across like he isn't a seasoned guy and I couldn't relate to his presentation."
1,The Cow and The Pig Who Went Quackers,"In ""The Cow That Went Oink"", one cow could not moo. He said ""Oink."" One pig could not oink. He said ""Moo."" All of the other animals laugh at the cow and the pig. The cow teaches the pig to oink and the pig teaches the cow to moo.I suppose that I am in the minority because I did not like this story at all. Perhaps if this book focused more on the teasing that the two animals received, I would have been inclined to give a better rating.I did not see a reason why children would care what either of the animals sounded like. Most two years olds (the group that I work with) are just beginning to associate the animals to the sounds that they make. This book would only seek to confuse youngsters who are beginning to develop their own language skills.The text is simple enough so that it could only be suitable for young children of this age group. Perhaps three's and four's can appreciate the symbolism of this story."
5,Absolutely wonderful,This album was wonderful. I have owned this CD for many years now and I have never gotten tired of it. IT is a great example of music from the 30's. You will love it!
5,Lightest-weight cup available,"This is by far the lightest-weight mug available (that i could find). It is actually the only ""dish/cookware"" i take with me on backcountry treks, even for a couple weeks at a time. It boils water very quickly since it's titanium (use your knife or something to pick it up off your stove/fire by the handle). It cleans up really well and easily (dont let food get cake at the bottom of it). And all in all is a great cup (test the brim before you take a sip if you made coffee, it could burn you if it hasn't cooled down for a couple minutes, which is about as long as it'll ever take since titanium transfers heat so fast). It also seems very durable and I haven't crushed, bent, or been able to damage it in any way.Like I said, the only dish/cookware I need to survive :-)Like all titanium products though the price might be a little steep for some, but this will probably last longer then other alternatives."
2,Overpriced,"Pass this one by. Look for the titanium products made by Snowpeak instead, better quality and price.The price on this is too high. Mine came with a dent in it. I popped it out, but you can still tell. I should have returned it, buy I am lazy.I still use it, its very lightweight and fits over the bottom of my steel water bottle."
3,NOT TITAN,"Welp....I made the silly mistake of thinking that the cup was in actual fact the Titan Kettle. I assumed this as the price is very similar and didnt realize that a titanium cup could be so expensive.That being said, its a decent cup of small proportion and very light. The build is a little sloppy on some corners of the lip, but feels sturdy enough in my hand.I love MSR's products and stand by them, but this cup is still very expensive for the size and quality."
5,An excellent primer on the Sacco-Vanzetti case.,"The author mostly maintains a journalistic disinterestedness, and is not a creature of the passions aroused by both sides. Not until the final 5 pages does he introduce his personal views. He should have offered more personal insight since he is so conversant with the facts. For example, if Sacco is guilty, then his second crime is sending Vanzetti (whom the author believes innocent) to his death. The grounds for a re-trial, even given the time period, seem secure, and there is lots of room for reasonable doubt. The publication date is 1962 not 1971."
4,Light weight life's philosophy book.,"Ok, this book appeals to me, but the basic message is one that I've followed all my life. ""To give your life meaning, get a boat!"" , ok that's not quite what he says, its more like, ""follow your dreams."" But his dream was to own and mess-a-bout in boats and that's mine too. So landlubbers aren't going to get the ""follow the dreams"" message because he talks about it in boating concepts... row when you can't see where you are going, but trust that you'll avoid the rocks.. tack if the straight way is impossible but don't lose sight of the marks...Sailors will love it."
5,Wonderful book,I got this book as presents for friends who are at a turning point in their life. The book was very helpful to me 10 years ago . I hope it helps them as much as it helped me.
1,First you have to learn to write....,The writer has good intentions but his strained metaphors get a little tedious until finally you can' t it take anymore! After.... jibing is like life.... tacking is like life.... anchoring is like life.... Do you get the idea?
5,First You Have To Row a Little Boat,"This short but insightful book, speaks to the profound truth that Mother Nature is the great equalizer and her lessons apply to all of the human race. My father who was a mariner at the early age of thirteen imparted this knowledge upon me when I was young and deaf of ear. As life has gone on, these words continue to ring forever true. No matter your status on earth, the winds of life care not and it is your flexibility to change that will see to the safest harbor!Marie Macozek 1/18/09"
3,Furber's Story,"The title concerns me some. The book was less about Omensetter and more about Reverend Jethro Furber.There's quite a mix of linguistic tricks in this difficult novel. Grab a glossary of literary terms and go looking - you'll probably find at least one example of each in here.Frankly, I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. I was expecting to have to work at this (it is Gass after all), but I just didn't really enjoy it. There were many funny, moving passages that made the read worthwhile, but I never felt truly drawn to any of the characters.Would I recommend this? Yes, but only if you have enjoyed other difficult ""literary"" experimental works. Certainly, it is not for anyone wanting a light read."
5,Great old time book,I purchased this as a gift for someone with a cat named Mrs. Whiskers... was glad to find it on Amazon as it is no longer in print. It is a wonderful book with fun but simple illustrations and rhymes that describe the different moods of a cat.
4,Revenge of the NERDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Awesome book that was purchased for my Step Dad. He specialy requested this ""must have"" for Christmas in 2009. I read a bit of it and it was really informative and interesting!!!"
4,Must Reading for Anyone Interested in the Internet,"Anyone ineterested in the Internet should read this book. ""Nerds: A Brief History of the Internet"" is a comprehensive narrative about the people and ideas that coinicided with the development of this mass medium."
4,John Entwistle-'King Biscuit Flower Hour' (King Biscuit),"Another great sounding archive release from the King Biscuit sacred vaults.This time,we go back to March,1975 at the Philly Spectrum when The Who's bassist John Entwistle(R.I.P.)under takes his very first solo tour.Probably enjoyed The Who songs the most,like ""Heaven And Hell"",""Whiskey Man"",the novel ""Boris The Spider"" and ""My Wife"".Plus,I also dug his Buddy Holly cover ""Not Fade Away"".Line-up:John-bass&vocals,Robert Johnson-guitar&vocals,Mike Decan-keyboards,Jeff Daily-sax and Graham Deacon-drums.The 12-minute plus interview isn't bad.Worth checking out."
4,JAE Live at the Spectrum,"My initial reaction on hearing this classic recording from the King Biscuit vaults was how great it sounded over twenty years after being recorded. Frustrated by the lack of live "" Who "" activity at the time, John formed his own band and took it out on the road in the UK and America,etc.Kicking off with ""Heaven and Hell "", the band played a tight set including John's songs, Who material, and a different version of the Buddy Holly classic"" Not Fade Away "" taken at a faster pace than the original.The interview with John and Who sound man Bob Pridden is interesting too. The only reason I didn't give this CD five stars is because the music content seems a little short measure.I would recommend this CD to anyone who has more than a casual interest in the Who."
5,patio clock,"Very pleased with this clock so far. Numbers are easy to read from pool which is quite a ways from patio. It has a plastic cover for the battery area that you secure with tape- an actual hard-plastic attached/removable cover would have made this clock absolutely perfect! but I have it hanging under the eave, which protects it from rain."
3,You get what you pay for...,It's lightweight & cheap. Pretty sure it will blow away in the Kansas wind. Sending it back for something more expensive & heavier!
5,Great clock!,"This clock is huge and can be seen from a great distance when working in the yard, etc. It keeps perfect time!"
5,Really great for those who like to bake!,"Country Baking is one of the best Gooseberry Patch cookbooks on the market- especially if you love to bake. I particularly love the recipe for pumpkin biscuits and ginger molasses biscuits. The Farmhouse buttermilk bread is also excellent.For those who aren't familiar with Gooseberry Patch, each book is filled with great recipes and cute pencil illustrations. Add this one to your collection!"
5,Great prep for students,I use this book everyday as review in the classroom. It allows the students to go over work they need help in and prepare for assessment.
4,Dixieland meets big band swing,"A nice collection of classic early recordings by one of my favorite big band players, trumpeter Bunny Berrigan. This disc casts a wide net, gathering Berrigan's highlight performances with early editions of the Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and Dorsey Brothers bands, as well as in smaller combos along with jazzmen such as Bud Freeman and Cozy Cole. These tracks share in common a penchant for the neo-Dixieland trad-jazz style that this generation of early '30s swingsters often reveled in... It's fun, spirited material -- they obviously had a gas playing this sort of music -- but since the performances are almost all instrumental, other than an opening tune featuring Connee Boswell on ""Me Minus You,"" we miss out on Berrigan's unique skill at accompanying singers, which I think was one of his greatest strengths. A swell set, but his later work as a bandleader is even better."
4,Something for the heart,"The book was the gift of a friend. An easy reading, nothing new, with some slightly tedious bits. However, the rather surprising turn at the end makes up for all of it - makes one empathise and think! It is an excellent choice as a present for teens and adults."
5,loved it,What a great movie to share with your family! It really makes you appreciate the great life we have today!
5,Well Written story,This here was well written story and a sad one at that I really did enjoy watch it but did have tears as the story went through. I do recommend watching this film.
5,Powerful!! But not necessarily for the reasons you may think...,"This was an incredible movie! A must see for its thought provoking story. What made it so powerful is its ability to successfully portray the Jews as ""other"" while making us all feel strongly for Bruno. The angst and stress the viewer feels is because it was ""our"" boy in that situation, not any of the others. And that's where the genius lies, we all got to feel a tiny sliver of what the real sufferers must have gone through. But only the tiniest sliver. And still it was terrifying.A brilliant film!"
1,*SPOILER!* Hate the ending,"History issues don't bother me too much. Hollywood had not presented itself to the world as a source of factual materials, although sometimes it does. This film was never promoted as factual, just like Inglorious Basterds was not. And I loved that film because it pretty much sums up my fantasy of what SHOULD have happened to the Nazis.I didn't benefit at all from this film. It was needlessly horrifying at the end. I gained nothing from this film. I already have lots of compassion for the suffering of others. I already know enough about the Holocaust. I already have seen enough kids die, working in medicine. I've seen enough pain, angst, suffering... I like to be entertained by films or moved by films... but not horrified and depressed by films. And this film is depressing. If you want to walk away feeling moved or happy, don't watch it. If you want to feel depressed about a film, you'll love it."
3,Needs Help,"I asked for the DVD for my birthday because I hadn't seen the movie yet. It was certainly not what I expected. Sure, as some mention, the story line is pretty unbelievable. I doubt there was any chance that an Ayrian boy could sneak over to a death camp. That is not the point of the movie though. The point was to show the tragedy of the Holocost on both sides. Yes, it was tragic for the German people too and the innocence lost among the youth. I would have liked to see it developed better showing more of the parents views but they made the movie really mostly about the boy. It just didn't seem well balanced to me but the acting was good."
3,Peculiar with English accents,"I cannot understand why the producers of this film cast English actors with very English accents to play the roles of Germans.Surely, there are enough German-born English actors, or English actors who could employ a German accent to add some sort of authenticity to this film. Actor's Equity may have prohibited them from using Germans, but, in my opinion, the accents made it hard to believe. Not that the story is unbelievable or unworthy in any way, but marred by the absence of German accents."
1,DISAPPOINTED ! ! !,It arrived on time but the DVD did not work. It stops at a certain spot and won't go past it. DISAPPOINTED ! ! !
5,Amazing Story,This is an amazing story about the relationship between a German boy and a Jewish boy that he meets. The plot is riveting and keeps your attention all the way through the film. The acting evokes great emotion throughout.
4,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was a thoroughly entertaining movie this stated without spoiling your viewing experience be, I advise having tissues at hand - this is a ""tear jerker""."
5,"Thought-provoking, heart-rending film","I saw this movie two days ago, and its images still haunt me. That men could treat each other so unjustly, and judge them so unfairly both saddens and angers me. I hope that many will watch and all will learn something new about themselves during the course of this film."
3,"""A boy..,.One boy?...The Only boy?"" ""No others?""","The Boy in the Striped PajamasWonderful as a Once Upon a Time story, with no surprise climbing to the next scene. Basically a little lacking in the last 1/4 of the movie, and the strange fitting, so as to show only One, (1) Child in the Camp? Very Questionable!I would say the movie was extinguished at the moment the clothes came off for the so called shower.A trying but failing end.......F I N E....."
3,"good movie, but not for kids under 16","I loved this movie, the casting was excellent. Although I think they were mainly British actors. The boy who played as the German Commanders was very photogenic and was groomed in the style and dressing of that time period. I liked the realism of the movie. I did not like the continual, daily extermination of the Jews. What got me very disturbed and bummed out about the movie was that the commander's son had been accidentally gassed to death in the showers at the end of the movie (along with several prison inmates). If I had a son or daughter I would never allow them to act in a movie such as this.That is why I gave the movie three stars."
1,Insulting,"This film perpetuates the myth that a large percentage of the German population was clueless about the genocide taking place in their country. It diminishes the horrific brutality of concentration camp life. And it asks us to feel sorry for the one innocent German boy who was ""accidentally"" gassed, instead of the millions of others equally innocents who were systematically slaughtered. This film is insulting to the memories of all those persecuted under Hilter's reign."
4,An Important Movie,"The only way to ensure we can evolve past such outright hatred and prejudice is to take a journey to such horrible realities in history; what better way to travel than that of cinema. We follow an innocent 8 year old boy that just wants what all boys want at that age, to have a friend to play with. His father is promoted and he and his family move to a home in the country. He is lonely and he happens upon this other boy his age wearing strange pajamas who is confined by a large wire fence. The beauty of this movie is how truthful it is that children see other children as automatic friends.This film is a very thought provoking film and I strongly recommend it. I do caution that the content is disturbing on so many levels as is the actual events within the history of WWII and concentration camps."
5,AMAZING!,"The film will capture your hearts and souls, putting you on the edge of you seat throughout. You will, no doubt, feel all the emotion that will seem to flow from your screen into your heart. Amazing film."
4,Very Good!,It seems a bit odd to describe this movie as good....but it really is. I suspected what happened in the movie. It was interesting to watch war from a childs innocent view.Definitely worth watching!!!!
3,Ends terribly,"The Bottom Line:The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is well-made enough but the ending is abominable, **spoiler alert** not only relying on ridiculous contrivances like the ability of an 8 year-old boy to dig a tunnel at about 55 mph, but also it's set up in a way that has us rooting for the evil Nazi to whisk his poor gentile son out of the gas chamber lest he die like the Jews who, hey, were gonna die anyway; if the movie makes you feel manipulated and slightly ill at ease, you're not alone.2.5/4"
2,Terribly sad,"This movie is terribly sad throughout. I don't recommend watching it unless you are a gluten for immense sadness.The movie is done well and I suppose its unfair to rate a movie based on content, but its just sad. Life's atrocities are bad enough, I wish I hadn't watched it."
4,heard but not seen,The DVD arrived as stated. I have not watched it yet but everyone says it is a very moving film so I am looking forward to watching it (with hankies Ive been advised)
4,A truly moving film,"What I really enjoyed about this film was that it was from the vantage point of two young boys who really don't grasp the situation they are in. All of the actors do a great job and the story is engrossing. There are films that you guess the ending before it happens and you are either still intrigued or you are somewhat disengaged, here I was fully engaged and pleased with the result. Give it a watch and you might find yourself still thinking about it days later."
4,Great story,"I have to say the story was great, the movie was good overall, only thing I know I will not be seeing this title again for the simple reason I just cannot stomach the ending again... It's too hard for me to handle."
5,The boy in the Striped Pajamas,"This was an outstanding film. The acting, directing, and story were great. It was EXTREMELY emotional, but beware...IT WAS DEFINITLY THE SADEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!"
5,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"Received within 6 days, in good shape, and as advertised, and good price. Would order from this company again. Movie subject helps me better understand this period in history"
5,A twist on this subject no one would think about.....,"This movie deserves even more then 5 stars....it proufoundly moved me and it will for whoever watches it...if this had happened in real life I am sure the German officer's ""eyes would be opened""... and the truth of what he was doing would become crystal clear to him...and he would no longer be able to continue ""his assignment""...."
4,Unexpected ending.,"Without describing the story ( everyone else has already done that well ),a few thoughts. A most unique perspective seeing the evolution of thecharacters, such as Bruno's mother and sister. A bit slow at times.BUT the ending was a shock. Sometimes we become a bit numb to the atrocitiescommitted by Germany during the war, this was a different type of awakening.Movies like this remind us never to forget."
5,A VERY SPECIAL MOVIE,"This one is a ""sleeper"" that I know as missed by most people. It is a different kind of Holocaust movie. It centers on a young boy (same actor from the movie ""Hugo"" 2011 movie) whose father is a high official in the Nazi Party. They move near a concentration camp that the Dad is in charge of. While secretly exploring the grounds, the adventurous and lonely boy discovers a fenced in area and another little boy in ""pajamas"" on the other side. They develop a secret bond/friendship through the fence. I will say no more except that EVERYTHING about this movie is wonderful. Acting, writing, directing, photography. This is a movie you will not forget, and will find yourself recommending to friends."
3,disappointing,"The DVD of the Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is based on the book of the same name by John Boyne. The basic story is that of Bruno, the nave and innocent son of the camp commandant of a Jewish concentration camp (Auschwitz). Bored with the lack of playmates, Bruno goes exploring and finds a boy in striped pyjamas on the other side of a high fence, and makes friends, with tragic consequences. The movie follows the basic tenet of the book, but differs on some minor points, (certainly, Shmuel looked less like a starved Jew than Bruno did) and I found the plummy English accent a little off-putting. It has a dramatic, Hollywood-style ending."
2,This IS A VERY Distrubing movie.,The ending IS HEART-BREAKING and lingers with you for a long time after watching it. (Maybe I'm just too sensitive(?). It went to an area thrift shop after two watchings.
3,"A quick, good read","I really enjoyed the video. I meant to order the book. I bought the book, and read it first. I felt the book was much better than the movie. I was not prepared for the ending ... what a twist.What a horrible time in the history of man."
5,Excellent!,"Essenstial perspective of the holocaust! The childs acting was top-notch! This is a must watch, must own!"
5,The boy in the striped pajamas,"I had read this book, and thought the movie was wonderful, I felt it was a wonderful way to show my children how the german people thought about the concentration camps, and they saw the typr of propaganda used to make them feel that they were doing the opposite of what they were doing. I loved this film !"
1,I cant review these items havenot received yet,Ordered in July and at this stage have not received so how can I review the items still waiting when I receive items will than comment
1,Never Received,"I never received this item, it was sent to the wrong address and then returned to you. I had to wait several weeks until my account was credited so that I could re-order it. I have finally received my re-ordered item today.JKanary"
2,Good information - but watch out for the bad,I found most of the information OK. But there was stuff in this book that made me wary. Prozac for PMS? Hysterectomy good idea for fibroids? Who would seriously consider these options? Natural progesterone and studies on it dismissed in one paragraph. These things left me rather unimpressed. I would not rely on this book as my main source of information.
4,Excellent resource,"This is a very honest comprehensive book on perimenopause, and certainly answered almost all of the questions I had! I'm going to get a copy for my gynecologist!! :)"
4,useful overview of the greatest TV drama ever!,"It's too bad this book abruptly ends in the middle of season six. Although the last season and a half was far from the show's best period, there were still some good episodes scattered in there, and it just seems annoyingly incomplete. The publisher should really issue a revised edition, although now that the show has ended that seems unlikely. But it's great having a resource like this w/ details about each episode, each season, the characters and actors, etc. The Court-TV website borrows shamelessly from this book for the episode summaries. ""Homicide"" is simply a fabulous show, and once you start watching it, you just want to know everything about it. This book, while it isn't perfect, contains a lot of information that wouldn't be easily accessible elsewhere, and is highly recommended for the show's fanatical fans for that reason."
3,"Good, but has an odd taste.","The tablets are quite large and even though they are chewable, it can be cumbersome to consume. The taste leaves something to be desired. However, if you need a large quantity of vitamin C per pill, this is one of your best bets in the chewable arena."
5,I have seen ALL the CROCODILE Videos; This One is the BEST!,"I have seen ALL the Crocodile videos currently available and this one is by far the most comprehensive with regards to the Nile Crocs and how they live. By focusing on perhaps the most interesting group, the Gremeti River Crocs, this video delivers ""the goods"". From the edge of your seat hunting strikes to the caring raising of baby crocs, this video does not disappoint."
3,Hit&Miss,J.Randy Taraborrelli is a trip.His Books on Diana Ross&Michael Jackson were each a Trip.He wrote a few Weak Books as well.this Book falls into in Between.Interesting tidbits but overall unlike the Diana Ross Book witch was a Trip&The Michael Jackson Book that was a Great Read this one just goes into different spots.Madonna is of course one of the most Interesting Subjects In Pop Culture over the past 30 Years but this Book is Hit&Miss& falls just short of being a must to me.
4,very interesting,"This book is very thick, but its an easy read all the way. I know this book can't all be true, but it sure feels like it. Very well done."
5,Loved it!,"Am I the only person on earth who doesn't know every little thing about Madonna? Judging from the cynical customer reviews here, I must be. I found this book to be well-researched and very well done. The writer is compassionate, and tells both sides of every story -- not just Madonna's side. In the Sean Penn battering episode, for example, he interviewed Sean and Sean denied it ever happened. Sean says he did not tie her up. That's why Taraborrelli wrote that there are ""two sides"" to every episode of domestic abuse. This was a great book. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good read, and one that really explores the life of a woman who everyone seems to know ... but not until reading this book did I really feel I knew her. Read this book!"
2,Too many probable lines,"Too many times in this book there are quotes between two people-who the hell hears all these conversations? Also to many ""Maybe Madonna..."" or ""Possibly she was..."". If you don't know, don't write it. Also Too many descriptions of what she was wearing. I doubt anyone cares to remember what someone wore to breakfast in 1985, but it is here."
3,"gossipy, but no social commentary","There isn't really anything new about Madonna in Taraborrelli's unauthorized 2001 biography that hasn't already been covered in Rolling Stone magazine, or on MTV or VH1 specials. Taraborrelli, however, does a good job of compiling already existing information and some of his own, new Madonna material in his book. The book is gossipy, with salacious details of Madonna's love affairs, and the many people she has steamrolled over on her path to fame and fortune. What this book lacked was a look into Madonna's creative process, and a cultural and social commentary on the impact of her artistry. Madonna's vision - her music sense, dance background, fashion, and sexual brazenness - helped to usher into the world a generation ready for MTV and great dance music; her strong influence on pop culture is undeniable. Unfortunately, Taraborrelli gets so bogged down in the gossipy aspects of Madonna's life that his book seems to forget her musical and artistic ingenuity."
1,Proven irrelevant,"Well, now it's 2002, and the the revolution has definitely not been televised. We've heard now from authors like these guys for about, oh, 10 years or so that smart cards are the next revolution. That it's just a matter of time before mag stripe cards are swept aside in this tidal wave of new technology.Friends, it just ain't gonna happen here in the States. Despite massive attempts by GemPlus and other 'leaders' described in this book, the entire thing has been just one more marketing-driven attempt to force unneeded technology on the masses. The dog didn't hunt, and these 'visionaries' are now unwinding all their efforts here, sending thousands of programmers out on to the streets.This thinly veiled advertisement, with very poor design and little original content, has suffered the ultimate indignity: history has rendered it all but irrelevant."
5,Solomon - A Bible Story in Movie - DVD,"If you love or want to know or see a bible story in a movie, I highly recommend this movie. Solomon the son of King David, starts with his brother trying to get the throne, but of cause as God said Solomon will be the next king, Solomon gets the throne. The story goes right through to his death. Shows his strong love and relationship with the Queen of Sheba and how that God and the people get angry with him when he starts to worships other Gods. Commandment no. 1. You shall have no other gods before me. 2. You shall not make for yourself an idol. Well made movie, great actors."
1,So Sad,Here was a beautiful opportunity missed. Somebody really needed to read their Bible. It's not ok to dramatize and add to the Bible like other literary works.I was very disappointed and would have returned this video if I could have after watching it.
3,Story of Solomon,"I know they don't make movies to follow everything in the Bible, but what disturbed me is when Solomon was asking children what the 4th commandment was, and they answered quoting the Fifth, or maybe I heard wrong, replayed it and heard same thing. Exodus 20: tell us what the Fourth commandment is. Movie script writers need to research more before making movies. Otherwise it was ok."
3,Solomon,I have watched the movie Solomon several times. Some of the Biblical facts follow the Bible. One thing has always bothered me about the movie. The segment regarding Queen Sheba. I have researched my scriptures and I find nothing either in the Book of Kings or Chronicles that gives truth to the interpretation of the story in the movie. Queen Sheba came to Solomon to question his great knowledge. She brought gifts and observed all he did with his people. Solomon in turn gave gifts to the Queen and she returned to her own land. There is no love affair or marriage or child mentioned in the scriptures between Solomon and Queen Sheba. She is not mentioned in the Bible as one of Solomons wives nor is a child mentioned. The events of Queen Sheba and Solomon are pure fantacy on the part of the writer and film producer. That is why I am giving this movie a 3 star rating. Because the other facts about King Solomon reign folow scripture.
1,Save your money -- don't buy this oil lamp.,"I purchased two of these hurricane lamps in preparation for a hurricane. They arrived and both of the glass tops were broken. They were so cheaply made, I can not imagine that they would ever survive shippment. Do yourself a favor. Save your money. I wish I had."
1,BEWARE-DO NOT BUY THIS LAMP.,"THIS BEAUTIFUL DESIGN LAMP WAS ORDERED FOR ME FOR MOTHER'S DAY.TODAY I WAS ABOUT TO MOVE THIS LAMP TO ANOTHER LOCATION AWAY FROM THE DINING ROOM TABLE.AS I LIFTED IT FROM THE MIDDLE BOWL AREA, THE LAMP COLLAPSED AND THE HURRICAINE GLOBE FLEW OFF AND SMASHED ONTO THE FLOOR.IF THE LAMP HAD BEEN LIT AND I HAD NOT KEPT MY HANDS ON IT, THE WICK AND BOWL SECTION WOULD HAVE ROLLED ACROSS THE TABLE, SETTING EVERYTHING ON FIRE.THE TRUTH IS, UPON VERY CLOSE INSPECTION, THE LAMP ACTUALLY WAS MADE IN TWO PIECES AND THE BOWL AREA AND THE BASE WERE GLUED TOGETHER AT THE NARROW AREA WHERE THE BASE BEGINS.THE GLUE GAVE WAY AND THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN OIL LAMP MADE THIS WAY. IT IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN WITH POSSIBLE DISASTEROUS RESULTS.I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE COMPANY WHO MAKES THIS BUT WILL CONTINUE TO SEARCH.T.L.L.HOUSTON, TX"
1,Do not purchase!,"I should have listened to one of the reviews I read about how the base just came off when the lamp was picked up. When I unpacked the lamp, the heavy glass base was already separated from the rest of the lamp. The base is just glued to the rest of the lamp and , apparently, not very well glued. Rather than deal with the aggravation of returning it and trying to get a credit, I just glued the base back on with super glue, and I will be careful if I lift it. Too bad because it is a good looking lamp."
2,Unimpressed,"This book felt like the author wrote the rough draft in 2 weeks. It was predictable, from the first page. The characters were typical sterotypes for a romance: One wild child who wants to spread her wings, one uptight guy who needs to be shown how to loosen up.Very run of the mill stuff, but I guess for $3.99 you get what you pay for."
4,Enjoyable,"Jen and Jesse has just gotten married. They met each other just eight months ago on a website called Duets. Their family thinks they are too young to get married but they go ahead with it. And so starts this beautiful dreamy wonderful book. Jesse is twenty three years old just finish college and is a business man and Jen(Jennifer) his wife is an art major who is slightly ditsy. So starts this marriage of opposites. Obviously anyone who read this book will right away think of the Newlywed show on mtv but this book has a life of its own completly from the show. I thoroughly enjoy I ached when they fight, happy when they made up, and glad they make it back together in the end. What can I say I am a sucker for happy ending. One of my fellow reviewers says they hope they turn this book into a series I hope not I like tidy neat signing off of my characters."
2,Spoga.....warp speed!,I loved Simply Spoga...but I have to agree with Joy's review unfortunately. Spoga just felt so rushed and it took most of the joy out of this workout for me. It would have been better to add 5-7 minutes to the 5 Tibetans section and S-L-O-W down.
1,Beware the Translation - We got Spanish,"This particular edition came as a Spanish translation, although it was not clearly marked as such in the reviews and the information about the book."
2,Poor printing quality.,"I ordered this Koran translation for a gift, but it turned out that the quality of the printing was very disappointing. I wish Amazon would give better attention to the printing quality of books offered. I already have Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation of the Holy Koran, but from a different publisher. For this particular translation of the Koran, I personally recommend the one published by Saba Islamic Media, or by Amana Corporation. Apart from the printing quality, I strongly recommend this translation of the Holy Koran (by Abdullah Yusuf Ali) for English-speaking moslems or non-moslems who'd like to know more about Islam."
1,Too hard to read - I'm sending it back.,I was so excited to received this book.It took 2 weeks to arrive and I immediately contacted the seller to return it.The pages are so thin you can see what's on the other side.(If you're talented maybe you could read both pages at once...LOL)The commentary on the bottom of the page is SO tiny I would have to usea magnifying glass to read it.The book is a heavy paperback and was shipped in a paper envelopeso the cover got damaged in the mail.One cool thing about it is that it is bound backwards like a book in arabic.Too bad the paper is such poor quality...I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Small type point makes reading difficult,"The size of type (2 or 3pt) used in this book makes it very very difficult to read. I purchased the book because it appears to be an excellent work. Perhaps it is, but the print size is most difficult to see and I, regretfully, had to return the purchase."
5,Great!,"Henty's #1 next to the renowned YOUNG CARTHAGINIAN... I am a homeschooler and this is my favorite. If you like this, I recommend R.M.Ballantyne. This is a not put down."
2,Weak,"I suppose when he wrote, we knew very little of the Gauls, but it's hard to read with all the missing and mistaken info"
5,One of his best books!,"I am a G. A. Henty fanatic, so I'm a bit prejudiced, but this is definitely one of his best books. Love reading- I have dozens of his books on my Kindle, and every one's a treasure."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"This is an excellent book, one of the best I have ever read. All of G.A.Henty's books are great, but not for someone who has trouble with reading or comprehension, because these books use old english, being written over 100 years ago. I am a great fan of Henty's books, and this on is no exception!"
4,Hottest Carcassi You'll Likely Come Across,"As impressive as Akkerman's electric playing was, I was blown away by his nylon string work. It had an freedom and edge that few devoted classical players allow themselves. I'd had this album before I even knew who Diabelli and Carcassi were or heard anyone play their music. The little Carcassi etude is from his Guitar Method and is still one of my favorite pieces to play. The brooding Andante Sostenuto can be found in the anthology entitled something like ""World's Favorite Classical Guitar Music Vol 2"" (can't recall the publisher, maybe Alfred). ""Kemp's Jig"" sounds better on the lute but, lefty lutes being scarce, I worked out my own arrangement on guitar - Noad has one as well in his Renaissance Guitar anthology. I always wished Akkerman would do a album of solo pieces, but I suppose this is as close as he ever came."
3,Abbott & Costello,"I liked the first disc, second disc was a little disappointing. The second disc is more like a documentry not at all what I had expected from the description of product."
5,Want to see the Rigelian war (ISW3),"I enjoyed this book, as with the others in the series. However, I would like to see a book devoted to ISW3-the Rigelian war.As a side note, I love the way Admiral Antonov holds politicians in utter contempt.Really wish that Weber & White (or either separately) would flesh out this series like the HH books. ISW4 (the Bugs) had to great books devoted to it. What about ISW 1 through 3? The Rigelian wars really appear to be interesting."
3,"""Lensmen"" of the 90's","Nothing deep here. Just pulp, space opera reminding me of the E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's ""Lensmen"" series. Lay down US$5.00 and escape for a couple of hours."
3,a good book,"I liked this book.It has good plot and good chacters. Its just that it says so much about the Third Intersteller War and The Wars of Shame that i got tried of it. I also want them to write about them. But it goes on how the Federation's navy is badly under strength and then in he loses so many SD's in Parsifal,Loreiel,and Thebes that it seemed to contrdict one another."
3,Decent Military Sci-fi.....,"Decent military sci-fi action. A bit slow at times but packs a killer ending. Reminded me, at times, of the 1980's Japanamation classic ""Starblazers"""
5,A real collector's item: Good example of early Dorsey,"This Cd covers Jimmy Dorsey's 1936-37 ""swing"" period quite well. (Not to be confused with his later ""big hits"" period, which featured duets with Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell with a Latin-American flavor). Of course, Bob Eberle is heard here on several tunes, as well as other vocalists, Don Matteson and Frances Langford. CD also features the 1936 recording of ""Pick Yourself Up"", which was never issued by Decca in the US. This is an older CD issue, which means the music does have some scratch sounds, but that is to be expected."
2,Blood Indeed,"I bought this single on a whim a few years ago, mainly bought for the ""Dangerous"" remix and the Refugee Camp Edit of ""Blood on the Dance Floor."" I was disapointed with both. The former is your average club mix with an irritating effect applied to the lead vocals throughout. The latter is an interesting interpretation but undanceable, which defeats the purpose of the song. The other ""Blood..."" mixes are your standard club fare. I recommend this single only to hard core MJ fans and collectors. If you're looking for some quality MJ remixes I highly suggest the ""Stranger In Moscow"" maxi-single instead."
3,pretty average for mj,somewhere between the brillant billie jean and the tour de force of remember the time but not quite on par with either.it's okay but far from his best.
5,Cotton and Velvet PURPLE sling,"Looks even nicer than in pic,more toward purple in color. Appeared smaller than I thought, but my mistake, measurements are correct. Nice for carrying smaller amounts of stuff. Received many compliments."
2,It was like wearing a leotard....,"Even though I'm 5'2 and 110 lbs: having 2 kids, making poor eating choices and being in my 30's has made my body start morphing into something that I don't recognize anymore.Buttoning and zipping my pants has become impossible-and requires a lot of squeezing, grunting, and Hulk arm strength to accomplish. All because of the evil, very stubborn, pool of fat that's gradually accumulated in my stomach... No where else, JUST my stomach...After some research I figured this body briefer would be the answer to all my prayers.Sadly, this has done NOTHING to reign in my spare tire.I will say that it's very comfortable though and very well made. But, this particular model is more geared for someone who doesn't have any extra fat deposits in their middle. In which case, they should save their money and count their lucky stars that their bodies don't require any extra help to look good.Quite simply, this is nothing more than a leotard."
5,Archer's Bible,Anything and everything you wanna know about archery. Showing you aiming to tuning. Great book! Will look for more from this seller and author.
5,Great book!,"I am retired, and love to read. As a matter of fact I'm reading three separate books right now. This ""Traditional Bowyer's Encyclopedia"" is actually a compilation of many very good articles by various experts in the field. I'm really learning a lot. I haven't touched a long bow in 40 years, but now that I have the time, I'm planning on getting back into target shooting at the local mountain archery range. These articles are bringing me up-to-date quickly! You'll really enjoy this material."
2,"good weight, soft, but doesn't last long at all","it's hefty for a nerf football; travels as well as regular football.and it's soft enough to be handled by children.however, the paint chips off as soon as it hits the outdoor ground and so does the sponge, or whatever the material, it consists of.in addition, it definitely should not be played with in the water. it soaks up water and does not dry for a week no matter how much you squeeze the moist out of it."
3,Quality toy,Good quality. Nice to have for tailgating at Heinz Field. Tight spirals and long distances. Won't damage cars in parking lots either.
3,Very ummm interesting,"Well I had to admit, out of the entire series that I have watched so far, this one has to be the most boring. Great story ofcourse...its the Bible. But the involvement of the 3 characters is very little and unlike the rest of the series their not involved in the actual story for that I'm disappointed. But for a biblical based movies its fine."
5,Perfect,"This is currently my favorite film.I hesitated to see it for some time, thinking that I didn't want to sit through two hours about a guy who walked across a wire. When I finally did sit down to watch it, I was enthralled within the first few minutes. There is so much more to this film than meets the eye. (For example, it is one of the best world trade center memorial films, precisely because it doesn't aim to be.) The story is wonderfully and entertainingly told, the characters are genuine, and the film is emotionally powerful. The soundtrack is fantastic as well.This film is absolutely magnificent. I consider my life enriched to have seen it."
5,I saw it and still don't believe it,"I saw this movie in a local theater about a month ago and I can't stop thinking about it. It's a good, well constructed documentary film that uses some recreated scenes as well as current interviews and period film and photos. The story of how Phillipe Petit planned and executed a tightrope walk between the twin towers is laid bare. 1350 feet in the air, 200 feet across. It was hard to believe even as I watched it. It seemed inspiring and insane all at once. I don't know if he's courageous or crazy but I suspect the answer is both.If this movie sounds the least bit interesting to you, go ahead and get it. You won't be disappointed. If I hadn't seen it on the last night of it's run at the theater I might have gone more than once."
4,An Amazing Individual,"Amazing documentary - not so much for the filming, which is rather amateurish, but for the capturing of the spirit of an extraordinary individual. One man soaring above the dominance of the physical structures, almost angelic compared to the demons who could only destroy them 27 years later."
2,I love documentaries! Just not this one.,"Don't get me wrong, I love documentaries. I love film in general. I was really looking forward to viewing this, but it doesn't live up to the hype. The feat deserves 5 stars but the story is much more placid than the feat itself. Having the performer of the feat continue to go on and on and on about the most mundane information put my wife to sleep by the 30 minute mark. I stuck through the film, but could not wait for the end.I don't want to discredit the feat itself, which is really amazing, but it was lost in translation to film."
2,Save your time and money.,"A daring idiot likes to spend all of his time walking on very strong steel wires. Once he gets good at it, it doesn't matter how high he walks. Except if he falls he dies. He doesn't die. It's worth about 10 minutes and 50 cents."
3,"Man on Wire, Me on Tacs","When I initially purchased this CD (2), I felt a little silly. What? No car crashes? No murders? No sexually explicit scenes? It was soooo good. THEN it received an Academy Award! WELL . . . it was even better! How to Wire-Walk Between the World Trade Center Towers for Dummys. Mary M."
5,5 Stars! A crowd pleaser!,"I purchased MAN ON WIRE from Amazon and paid the public screening rights from the film's distributor in order to show it @ the SFASU Cole Art Center @ The Old Opera House in Nacogdoches, TX. This film brought out the crowds and kept them glued to their seats! MAN ON WIRE is fun, historic, and a thriller all wrapped into one. No wonder it's up for an Academy Award! --C.Cutler, Director of Galleries"
5,"Very Exciting, entertaining","""Man on Wire"" is most entertaining. If you didn't already know what it's about, it starts out like a subversive terrorist thriller, and of course, the premise is well laid out shortly after. These guys act like a bunch of naughty school boys pulling a stunt for which they know they'll be caught. It's the suspense leading up to the pranks that is riveting. Director James Marsh has crafted a fine film about the improbable passion of Philippe Petit that is instructive as well as entertaining. One thing I appreciated was that there's little or no reference made to the bombing of the WTC to distract from the narrative at large. That would be a whole 'nother film. Highly recommended."
4,Amazing story,"I first heard of what happened in this documentary from a children's book I was reading with my kids. Seemed unbelievable to me but when I saw this movie I had to watch it.The mere thought of walking a tightrope between the world trade center towers just freaks me out, even as I type this. But the drive to make this happen. The ingenuity of how to make it work. Amazing.The story is part prank and part intelligence mission. If you ever had the benefit of being up in those towers when they were around you have a clear picture of how high up that is. Crazy."
5,"Beautiful story - ravishing, touching, amazing","In an era of brilliant documentaries, this one rises to the surface. Cream of the crop. Miraculously, M. Petit had decided to film his progress and practice as a young man, so we see not only photos and current interviews, but lengthy sections of original footage. It was absolutely captivating to see not only the high wire shots, but to see Paris and New York in the 1970s. As a 40-something who first came to know Paris and New York in this era, it was beyond satisfying to see honest footage of the places I love. The clothes, the hair, the people, the freedom, the attitude -- it left me so homesick for a time gone by. The interviews are intelligent, sensitive, and utterly heartbreaking. If you dare to watch this, be prepared to be pulled in, and to have this film -- and this man -- on your mind for many days afterward."
2,One Sleazy Part Ruins the Movie,"This is a fantastic film. I'd like to watch it with my family, but there is a part where the guy is talking about how he felt like a rock star, and that he had groupies, and they show a sex scene, which is just stupid and unnecessary, and only detracts from the rest of the film, which is very classy. I'm very disappointed."
4,Excellent Documentary,"""Man on Wire"" touches the mind and the heart. It's amazing.However, I have one problem with the film -- a ""fault"" which I imagine may have been caused by its (probably minimal) stock-footage-licensing budget. The film could have used more historical context regarding the general state of decay and implosion in which the city of New York and the USA found itself during the Nixon Resignation, the bankruptcy of New York City, and the late-1960s/early-1970s critique of the Twin Towers as bastions of over-the-top capitalism (which they would remain until 2001.) Both NYC and the USA were hurting in 1974. But Petit's (a Frenchman's) unexpected, (and, thankfully, successful) highwire performance did a service to the Twin Towers by promoting and humanizing them, and to New York City and to the USA by re-emphasizing the the spirit of risk, initiative, and freedom that animated the Towers and that animates the United States."
3,Sad,"I'm afraid that the shallowness of Philipe was punctuated at the end. Why he did what he did was strictly for his own personal artistic ego. Someone totally self-absorbed. He had of course immense talent, but he also had a group of individuals who shared in his triumph. Actually this was a ""team"" effort. He supplied the talent, but he could not have articulated this talent without the help of others. Where does he go when it's over. Not to his team and girl friend that he supposedly loved and that supported him. He dropped them all. I was disappointed in the ""man"", not the documentary."
2,Interesting documentary,Interesting but could have been done in 30 mins. Fast forwarded and watched in about 15 mins. I got the point
3,Companion to picture book,"THere is a picture book about Philip Petit which is very good. I bought this because I heard that there was a film of him crossing between the towers. However, the film is mostly interviews made in the early 2000's. I wanted to show the film to the children, but there was a nude scene, so that made it unusable for children. However, very interesting, especially about how he got interested in wire walking."
2,"Just so you're not deceived by amazon, It's like a documentary....not a movie!!!","Very unsatisfied with Amazon's set up for this ""movie"". They advertise without a preview and amazon charges way too much for this non movie movie. We only watched half of it, interesting documentary, but we were expecting a movie. Amazon shouldn't be charging for this, let alone $2.99."
5,Amazing history and biography,"I was mesmerized by this documentary. I bought the copy for my father and we had a great family discussion about it. Having grown up in the NY/NJ area, I remember when Petit performed this. Learning about the history of this amazing and incredible feat was icing on the cake."
4,Fascinating Documentary,"I thought it was a brilliant documentary. A little slow and confusing at times, but something that everyone should see at least once!"
4,a great documentary and inspiring story,"It's an inspiring story about a tight rope walker who pursues his dream of walking across the World Trade Center towers. He (Philippe Petit) and others planned to do this feat even before the construction of the twin towers was complete. I think that it's very inspiring in that it shows the power of the human spirit... to pursue your dreams no matter how rediculous it may seem to others. Philippe obviously didn't do this for fame, money nor prestige only for the satisfaction of accomplishing his dream.Not to be too critical of the film and the people who made it, because everybody is entitled to their own views. I think however that it would have been nice or polite to put in a message in the credits paying tribute to those who have lost their lives in the terrorist attacks of 9/11. There where native New Yorkers who helped Philippe, including a man who used to have his office in the tower."
3,"Poor streaming, good movie.","The video quality was rather poor and blocked at points due to low resolution while streaming. However, the movie itself is rather good and watching this crazy french guy tight rope walk the twin towers is rather insane without any protection and doing so for over 45 minutes making multiple trips across the wire taunting the police in the process made this a thrilling documentary."
5,Crazy Passion,"In this intense, perfectly-paced documentary you are given a glimpse into the mind and soul of the most passionate man I've seen on film. This movie is not just a thrilling acount of one of the most outlandish stunts ever pulled, but a film about life and living it.I cannot recommend this film enough. I found watching it to me an uplifting and transformative experience."
4,Man on a Wire - A Remarkable Documentary,"Whether or not you are a risk taker or afraid of heights, you've got to see Man on Wire. It is a documentary about fearless Pilippe Petit, the famous French tightrope walker who pulled of a stunt walk from the top of the World Trade Center in 1974. With the help of his brilliant, loyal friends and a great deal of time planning out the physics and logistics, he achieved fame and now fortune.The story is magically told by each of the real life characters who played a role in the actual WTC stunt. Some 35 years after the event, they are still emotional when they talked about how they pulled it off. My family really enjoyed this, and so will you."
1,Never again,"Quit watching this, it was very boring. Wish I could get refund but nevermind. No thanks thought this would be a lot better."
2,return,"i bought this thinking it would make traveling with the headphones more efficient, but when i opened the box they came in and saw this carrying case in person, i was let down because it was so big. i was hoping the carrying case would save space, but its like way bigger than the headphones and so it doesn't even serve a purpose in my opinion. i'm about to return it now. i was disappointed."
5,Action Packed!,"The 5th book delivers as much action as the previous 4 do! This book always keeps you on edge living out the adventures of Navy SEALs in Vietnam. I found it very hard to put down, and like all of Riker's other books, I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this book!"
3,Error on front cover !!!,"Robert ZerbySt.Croix, U.S. Virgin IslandsE-mail: rwz1948@hotmail.comThere is a terrible error on the front cover of MEDAL OF HONOR. The Medal depicted is that of The U.S. Army and not the U.S. Navy !!!Otherwise, I enjoyed the book.Semper Fi,Robert ZerbySt.Croix, U.S. Virgin Islandsrwz1948@hotmail.com..."
4,herbal supplement,"I first found out about this product on Dr Oz. I have been using it for several months. The product is always fresh when it is shipped. So far, so good."
5,Just like buying thru apple,It was the same as buying thru apple. You still register the product thru apple but it was cheaper.
5,One of the best of the best vol.2,This volume of the series covers the soft corals and sea anemones; very important topics indeed for reef aquarium. The two books together are still not complete as there are many organisms found in a reef aquaria still not covered. In this series. A fine glossary accompanies this book. Much of what I had to gleen by trial and error and by reading arcane publications over the years is covered in this book. Approachable to the beginner yet a lot of substance for the expert.
5,A Must for any Salt Water Aquarium Household,My husband took a dive into the Saltwater Aquarium world. ALL of Sprung's books are a must have. They have a lot of info and definitely is a great resource. Well worth the price. It has been referenced many times throughout the saltwater aquarium evolution.
5,Excellent VIDEO Camera witn everything you NEED,"This camera stands out because the video quality is great, while unneeded features are left off. I don't need a color viewfinder--or a color LCD for that matter, even though this camera comes with one. I want to be able to aim it, that's all. I have a nice Olympus digital camera I bought on Amazon last year that takes PERFECT pictures and I don't need an inferior ""still mode"" which is commonly included with lots of these digital VIDEO cameras. Mercifully, Panasonic made the effort to make a camera for the real, practical world which does not force me to pay for a high-end digital camera and media capability that I do not need at all. The 2.5 inch color LCD is even too much in my opinion! I LOVE that this camera takes such good video and has an excellent zoom capability the most. That's all I really need!"
3,not a bad camera,"The PV-DV51 has pretty good picture quality, but the built in mic is pretty (bad), no mic jack either. Menu button is almost impossible to access during use if you have normal-sized fingers. Good cheap digital cam but I'm returning mine to get a Canon"
3,not a good value for money,"I am using this camcorder for last 2 and half year (well, I don't use it much). And for some time facing the problem of picture geting split into several small rectangular squares, which is very difficult to watch. And recently this camcorder broke where the plastic hooks with the hand strap (you can see a very cheap plastic being used)."
3,a nice little book (a friend),"it was a great pleasure to read some of the classic ch'an/zen poetry on the matter of enlightenment. i wish i could read more of this type of thing. Master Shen has really done a wonderful thing by producing this little book for people in enlish. it is not always possible to be happy in this life, whether enlightened or not, and i only hope that he will have happiness in the latter years of his life and a peaceful birth. thank you master shen."
2,Not a NEW item,I ordered the book Simply Shooters. This book came to me very tattered and worn. This is obviously NOT the new item that I ordered.
1,very poor quality,"One of these lights only worked for a couple of days. Also, looking at the pictures they looked much brighter that they were when I received them."
3,was it me?,"realizing that my impressions are all relative to my own temperment, let me just say what i have to say without regard for your approval.i was bored. a sense of civic duty kepy me from swapping dvds to ""The best of mr. monk"" or some other dvds i am anxious to enjoy. and enjoying is not any part of my experience with this docu/drama.i was bothered with the slow pace. ironically the subtitles were unnecessarily fast.hirohito's mannerisms suggested he was emotionally challenged- hich while true , the point was over emphasized.""i got it, i got it"" i thought when another superflous scene seemed more to remind us again and again of his stifled stiff slow formalized mannerisms.and now i will do what the producers should have done-- having made my points,: bow out and pull the plug. sayonara."
2,A very strange film,"One of the strangest movies I've seen in a very long time, it is about the final days of World War II and the life of the Japanese emperor Hirohito. I am not sure if he really spoke in a strange, affected way, or if he always made an O with his mouth and jutted his lips out, but that's what you see in the movie. Made by Russian director Alexander Sokurov, the film has a small cast and limited locations, making it feel like a stage play."
5,In My Rear View Mirror is EXTRAORDINARY!,"An extraordinary memoir by WPIX sports anchor Sal Marchiano. This a rare sports book that is literate, poignant and hilarious. Marchiano is without peer, he can write, from the old school, first working at the foot of a mean spirited Howard Cosell, graduating to become the pre-eminent sports broadcaster and journalist in the New York area. The chapters on Mickey Mantle are worth the price of the book alone.""In My Rear View Mirror"" is one of those books you will recommend to all your sports friends."
4,Not Bad,"Must For Any NY Sports Fan. I Liked The Book. Having Grown Up Seeing Sal On The News Doing Sports In The 70s And 80s. He Had Alot Of Good Old School Stuff And Good Stories Of The Nightlife Back In The Day. Good Stuff About The Early Days Of ESPN. Sals Good, A NY Legend, Just Too Bad Hes Not A Howard Stern Guy."
5,nice ride,can't beat them i have them on both my trucks they ride great very good quality its the only one for me
3,OK product,"The product was ok. It was not as powerful as I thought it would be and it doesn't work the full back. If you are tall, then it will just work from your midback to upper lower back."
3,Pretty good and strong massage,"I bought this after trying out the larger version in the store. I thought this would be better b/c it's small and portable, which was true, but I think the other one gives a better overall massage. BUT, for the money, this one is pretty darn good and definitely worth a try. The massage mechanism is very strong and gives your back a good workout. I think it could be improved by offering a heat option, car adaptor and a ""width"" option as it was a little tough on my spine in some areas. Some massagers just vibrate, but if anything, you will need to put a towel on this one as the shiatsu it is VERY strong. Pretty impressive for the price--the next one up is AWESOME."
1,Not what I expected,I was not really happy with this. I have the smaller pillow version so I was hopeful about this bigger one. I didnt realize the knobs dont heat up. Also they travel up and down the spine but there is no way to stop them in one spot so you really just get a light superficial massage. The smaller pillow version which has heat is much better. You can focus the massage in any spot.
1,"Leave ""Stranger in Moscow"" a stranger...","""Stranger in Moscow"" by Michael Jackson is a mediocre song for Michael Jackson to sing. The lyrics are quite garbled, and the song's content makes no sense. I am a tried and true fan of Michael Jackson and feel that ""Stranger in Moscow"" does not live up to some of Michael Jackson's other hits such as ""Remember the Time"" which had a nice theme and nice beats to it; ""Stranger in Moscow has no theme and disoriented beats. ""You Are Not Alone"" is a touching, heartfelt love song; ""Stranger in Moscow"" cannot be heartfelt because of the lack of emotion that is conveyed in the song. ""Stranger in Moscow"" is not something I recommend to anybody. I would not have even recommened Michael Jackson to sing it."
4,Nice product,I usually dont have great luck with this brand but I found the vitamin c to work well.I have more energy when I use them twice per day.I have not used these around the winter time yet but it will be interesting to see if it helps me fight or avoid colds. I dont really have the money to buy fresh citrus fruits on a regular basis so this is a nice alternative.
3,"Good, but try a balanced B-complex","This product is good, but after purchasing it I did some research and found that it is better to have a more balanced b complex because the b-vitamins work together. I feel better when I am taking the Balanced B-50 Complex which is also made by Nature Made."
3,Wow,Good pills but the bottle arrived broken and had to collect all the spilt peels in packaging it came in.
1,Faithful reader no more,"Does anyone bother to edit for Ms. Michaels anymore? From the very first paragraph the book begins to disappoint. (""A torrential torrent""? Really?) Anyway- the characters were half developed, the plot line skimpy, the dialogue trite, and the spelling errors abundant. It reads as is Fern Michaels is trying to be Janet Evanovich and cannot pull it off. She's just not funny. I have been reading Michaels for years and stayed loyal even through the downward spiral of her writing in the ""revenge"" series, but I have lost all faith in her now. I doubt I will bother to read her books again."
1,Waste of time,"Since I listened to the CD abridged version, it's possible I missed something that would have made this book at least mediocre. Not likely though. The title and the picture on the cover seem to have been for another book entirely. This was one time when an abridged version was better, because if I had to hear ""Dodo, Diddy, and Ducky"" just one more time, I'd have been tempted to burn the CD's. ""Dodo, Diddy, Ducky and Darby""...just plain Dumb. If the author ever writes another book with the Aunts, Please use their given names."
3,Enjoyable but Not Great,"I'd not read Fern Michaels before and may not again. The premise was interesting, the aunts were a hoot, but all in all, this was not terrific writing. Although the loose ends were conveniently tied up by the happy ending, the plot seemed scattered at times. The main characters of Darby & Ben weren't given much depth, & many details were glossed over. Actually, ""Hey, Good Looking"" reads more like a fairy tale than really good fiction - Bella as the wicked stepmother, the aunts as the likable clowns & schemers, & Ben & Darby as the plastic doll house figures for one of Darby's ""castles""."
1,"HEY, GOOD LOOKING","I was so angry when I started the book I almost didn't read past page 3. I have a son waiting for his 3rd kidney transplant and on dialisis, you have your main person saying it was wrong and -that theme carried through the whole book. How dare you encourage your readers to not give the Gift of Life!!!""Organ Transplant is the Ultimate Recycling."" I gave my kidney to my son and so did his cousin. Just a little was said at the end of the book but that's a little late. It should have encouraged donation all the way!!!!!!!"
1,A major turn-off,"This might have been a lightly entertaining novel if it weren't for the anti-organ donor attitude that cropped up so very often. As someone with a loved one waiting for a transplant, I found it extremely offensive."
3,"Sure it's great, but not for my hair type","I got this product because I'd heard it would be great for dry hair. Having recently gone blonder, my hair was a little dry & damaged, so I thought this would help. It's not for my hair type -- it left it feeling very waxy & unpleasant. Even rinsing it repeatedly for an extended period of time, it just didn't feel or look good. I have fine, relatively straight hair, so I just want to pass on that it may not be for you if you have similar hair."
5,Civil War,I love the Civil War and this program was very detailed and kept my interest. Would recommend for any Civil War buff.
4,good for the price,but not great the qualaty is not all that good but ok it covers some of the lesser none battles like south mt. so over all pretty good
1,not good,"I am always looking for a good quality rope toy. On this one, the rope came out the first time we used it."
1,Same thing happened to me....,"I had exactly the same experience, although I blame Target for the mix-up, as it was their product. Clearly they had the product numbers mixed up, because I kept receiving a set of bowls (tacky bowls); returning was easy, and I was advised to not order the fondue pot again. Last year was not a good one for ordering outside of Amazon itself, apparently."
1,poor product,"after ordering this item and recieving the wrong thing amazon was quick to send me a replacement whick again was the wrong thing. then they gave me return label which the post office would not accept . now amazon gave me 2 more labels that , we'll see if the post office will accept. this has not been a good trans action at all."
2,Not up to date,"We just returned from the Yucatan and using Hidden Cancun. We found much of it was not up to date. I think the author visited 25 years ago, revisited a few sites recently and used much from his previous visit without checking it out throughly. We did not think this was a good traveling book."
3,Okay,"This book is lacking in the detail that many other guidebooks to the area offer. I used it for a trip to Cozumel, and apart from comparing restaurant reviews with those found in other sources, I found it lacking. For a better guide, I would pick the Moon guide to Cancun and Cozumel."
1,A Night to Remember,I could not even play it - it came from England and was a region # 2 which can not be viewed in the USA - what a waste of my time and money -I had to return it and I so wanted this movie !
1,"Love the Movie, but...","Love the movie, but I was profoundly disappointed that this version, unlike the VHS copy I have, does NOT have closed captions or subtitles. I bought the DVD for the alleged improved picture and sound quality, only to lose the captioning. If you don't want/need captions/subtitles, I suppose it is an adequate product."
5,titanic night to remember,"After doing research on the Titanic, I showed this vintage movie to my 6th grade class to validate the event and bring about an awareness of the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking. The students enjoyed this movie so much that they ""moaned"" every time we had to stop because of class time restraints. They researched who the victims and survivors were, the weather conditions and iceberg reports, the design of the ship and why it sank, and the current exploration of the wreckage. They wrote journals as if they were those who survived and those who perished, wrote persuasive letters for/against displaying artifacts, and even researched the vintage clothing of the 1912s. It was an amazing project, and the movie made the entire event real to them. I give this video an A++!"
1,Not subtitled at all,"If you're deaf or hard-of-hearing, don't bother buying or renting this movie. There are no captions or subtitles whatsoever.Really wish Criterion would join the 21st century and provide equal access to their films."
2,A Night to Remember,When we opened the package and took out the DVD it did not play. I tried 2 other systems in my home before I discovered the disk was cracked. I don't know if it came that way or happened in removing it from the double pack. The documentary disk that came with it was wonderful and gave a great insight to the movie and events that took place on that terrible night.
4,A Night to Remember DVD Review,"This is the best movie about the Titanic disaster, followed by the 1953 version. I consider James Cameron's version the least interesting of all, not even as entertaining as the made-for-TV version with George C. Scott and Eva Marie Saint. A Night to Remember DVD appears to be a 1.66:1 widescreen with fine picture and sound; however, it is not enhanced for 16:9 TVs."
2,"Great movie, disk won't play well","I have the movie on VHS, and love it, so was eager to replace the old format with a DVD. Unfortunately, while the disk plays all of the trailers and ads for other items just fine, when it gets to the movie, it looks up repeatedly - I can view a few frames, and then it locks up again.Perhaps this was a manufacturing flaw, or some problem with my own DVD player (although I can watch other movies just fine).Needless to say, I'm *still* looking to replace my VHS copy with a working DVD."
5,A movie without pretense,"Watching this movie made me feel for those who perished, along with those who survived. An excellent rendering of the tragedy. Kudos to the director who insisted on getting the facts straight. The other two ""Titanic"" movies' additions of a love story made you care a bit more, but detracted from the other true love stories and the sacrifices made. Truth is always better than fiction!"
5,No love B.S in this version,"Great well done Movie much better then the new version....No made up Romance in this movie....The ship went down fast 2 hours or less in real life...In the new Version it was like it was put on hold for Romance....Yuck....They had to Hollywood it up and wreck it...Why focus on 2 fake idiots....The old version deals with people in general not one or two people all of the time...1,500 died that night..This old version does a good job on what it must have been like that night...From the Capt to the crew and what they went threw....Very Sad even to this day..."
4,Great Customer Service,"After reporting to Amazon via a review of receiving a damaged video, the seller immediately contacted me to apologize and give a full refund. In retrospect, I should have contacted the seller first before writing the review, but I thought it would go nowhere and was a hassle (to return the item, etc.). The sellers quick response and action receives notice as great customer service."
5,THE BEST,unless u count that the ship didn`t break into half(they should have edited the last moment of the 97 film unto it)... The incrediable facts of Walter Lord are intact.... A must have-indeed:-))))))))
5,An Accurate and Non-Glorified Titanic Retelling,"This is based on the Criteron DVD release.I first saw this movie in 1986 on Showtime and at the age of 16, it drew me to tears. Keeping in mind the fact that the Titanic broke in two wasn't proven until her discovery in 1985, this movie was so accurate in every detail. The sets were so remarkable, the acting was so believable and the facts were represented to the best of known knowledge of the time, without a made-up love story or unneccessary drama.Not to discredit James Cameron's stunning and modern retelling, this movie I think is the best and a must for any Titanic enthusiast. With so many books, movies and documentry's on this subject, this movie surpasses the lot."
5,Best Titanic Movie,"A Night to Remember is the best Titanic movie. The Titanic movie that won so many awards took a lot from this film and added on much more melodrama, but A Night to Remember ends up being much more touching and heartfelt."
5,A night to Remember,Excellent DVD very interesting the way this DVD was made. The DVD was great picture and great quality sound! It was very well done!
3,took care of the problem,After finding out the dvd I recieved didn't play on any of my dvd players including two computer they took care of the situation in a speedy way. thank you
3,Fair representation of events.,"Ordered through Amazon and had it in about 5 calender days without any problems. Think this is a fair repesentation of events. The author was one of my favorites growing up, have been re-reading some of his works that I read as a kid and reading some that I missed. Price was just right."
2,"Nokia is great, but avoid this one!","We always have preferred Nokia candybar style phones, but this model is poorly designed. It feels like it is made of cheap plastic, like a toy. The protruding buttons make it much too easy to hang up with your cheek. Sound quality is not as good as the older monochrome display Nokia that this phone replaced.Unfortunately, this was the only candybar style Nokia that Cingular was carrying when we upgraded. This design seems to be falling out of style, but we love them for their ruggedness. You drop them, and at worst the shell comes off and you snap it back on. If the shell does get damaged, get a new one and the phone looks like new."
2,Can't hear,"I bought this phone because it was the cheapest model and I was in a pinch. My previous one and Cingular wouldn't give me a replacement until I signed a new 2-year contract. FYI: Cingular is no good. I can barely hear with this phone, so I have frequent ear pain after pressing it so hard to the side of my head. Other than that, I do like getting on the internet so quickly, though the loading time and graphics leave much to be desired. So in sum, pay a little more for a better phone and get away from Cingular as fast as you can."
2,Ringtones? Keypads?,Everyone seems like this phone but this phone doesn't fit for everyone's size. The phone is great for its small size but I have problems with keypads due to tiny size and awkward position and has its very limited capacities plus ringtones. It would not let me use its silent mode without making a sound when i set it for vibrate mode. I find it very dissappointing design and manipulating cost-effective prohibitiveness to the usefullness of messaging and web-browsing.
2,Do not buy if you value your hearing,"I've always bought Nokia cell phones, because they usually offered the most friendly, intuitive interface. I hate this phone. Who would have thought that a cell phone wouldn't come with volume controls?I have the ring tone on the lowest setting and it still makes me jump when it rings inside my purse, and I have NEVER seen a phone without the ability to adjust the audio levels while talking!! I feel like I'm losing my hearing in my right ear, although now I hold the phone about an inch away from my ear while talking.The middle wheel is too small even with my small fingers, I'm always hitting a button vs. the wheel. When I press the end call button, for some reason it always activates the speakerphone first. I bought it with a 2 year warranty so feel I'm stuck with it."
3,I've enjoyed their live shows,"Dazz Band does a great show, now for decades, and can keep the house partyin...this album is a good dance album and showcase their music ability."
2,"Decent quick reference, poor for teaching yourself","If you already know how to use another photo-editing program and you're transitioning to PhotoShop, this might just be the book for you. It has a rather clever and innovative way to show exactly where on a cluttered screen the item under discussion is, and it also has some decent ""quick tips"". The examples are also pretty good. However, I don't see how anyone can claim to write a book that will ""teach"" you a software program if it doesn't give you exercises to work your way through; Photoshop is way too powerful and complex to learn without also practicing. It also doesn't explain why you might want to use any of its myriad features/effects/filters. But as I said, if you're transitioning from another program and you already know what any photo-editing program should do, this could be an excellent choice."
3,Photoshop CS2 manual,"Easy to read and follow, but skims the surface of the program. There is so much more to learn, so many tools and functions that it never even covers, especially some of the stuff that is new to the CS2 version like placing type on a path."
1,I cant believe how dire this is!!!!!!,"Call it what you want, but the GR-DVP3U deserves it's place in the museum. Its heavy, nasty and cumbersome. The stills taken by it are a disgrace and shouldnt be allowed to classify itself as a stills camera. The software is sooooo hard to use and the side panel keeps falling off on mine. Whatever you do......dont buy this, Its not something to be stolen. Even if your room mate has stolen it! THE NOBODYS are doing the wrong thing when its team doesnt need its star players working elsewhere."
2,Not sturdy enough,"Although this is a board book and it says for babies and toddlers, the book itself is not sturdy enough. My 2 yr old son broke his book the first day by pulling the pages apart. This wasn't too hard to do. Basically, the pages are split in half so you can make the figure in the picture look like it is moving. If you pull the top half up and the bottom half down too hard, the page comes out. It's a cute concept and my son loves the pictures of the Toy Story characters but the book just isn't sturdy enough to stand up to a toddler."
3,"Cute, but not sturdy",The book is adorable and my kids love it! Maybe a little too much. It started to fall apart after just a few hours. There are inserts between pages that make the characters move. My boys were able to easily pull out those inserts.
2,On the Run (Disney Finger Fun Book),This book is a board book and very cute. It has pages that separate into two parts to simulate movement of the Toy Story people on each page. It fell apart within the first five minutes of gentle play by my 18 month old. He loves it so I will take the time to glue it back together instead of returning it. It is a great concept but the design and assembly need some work.
3,Wonderful book but will not last,"My grandchildren love the book, but looks as though its years old after only a couple of weeks."
3,"Good value, but not for the perfectionist","I bought this monitor to replace my old viewsonic that died on me. I mostly use my computer for browsing and gaming. After about a month of use I must say I'm dissappointed. First off, the screen isn't actually flast. If you follow the out edge, there is a slight curve. The glass covering the screen is flat, but the actualy screen is not. The monitor is nice and bright and colors looks good, but the screen flickers at any refresh rate over 60hz at high resolution which is a huge let down. At 60hz it feels like my eyes are bleeding when I looks at a white screen. The resolution range is fine though. Another complaint I have is the shadow I can see behind the screen. A sort of wavy pattern that gets annoying and visible when the screen is dark. I would recommend this monitor for anyone who doesn't need super high resolutions or isn't nit picky about monitors."
3,Lovely but too dark,Looking at this curtain from outside of the shower it's beautiful. A lovely pale blue sheer over brown taffeta. Sadly the brown fabric makes the inside of the shower too dark. If only that blue sheer were detachable it would be lovely with my Ricepaper EVA Shower Curtain behind it.
5,Works reliably,"I wanted a tally counter to help me keep a count of how many laps I walk around an indoor track at the city fitness center. Saw a number of cheap counters listed on Amazon and read varying stories of them falling apart or skipping numbers - not terribly useful.So, I decided to go upmarket an give this one a try. After several weeks, I have found this one to count reliably and hold together. It feels like a solid piece of equipment in my hand and it is comfortable to carry. The thumb activated counter ""button"" gives a reassuring mechanical click and I have not found it to skip. Resetting back to zero is a simple twist of the knob on the side.I'll try to take and post a picture showing how well it fits in the hand.In short, if a reliable tally counter at a decent price is what you are looking for, you have found it here."
4,happy with my purchase,"Works great so far, seems very sturdy and is comfortable. I would definitely recommend it for counting (I use it to count laps)."
1,Is it True? $21.60 for set of 6 mugs?,"Please confirm this issue for me. Several people trying to seek legal action against your company relating to creating false sales trick on the Amazon site. Specifically an item listed as follow: ""Portmeirion Botanic Garden Bristol Mug, Set of 6""According to the detail description on the sales site, it supposedly consists of six mugs. The total weight per set was at 5 pounds and the discount was more than 88%. However, many received only one mug instead of six mugs. This was not a first time Macy put this item on the site.To protect my rights and others at same situations, I have made copy of the site. I am sure, everyone expecting same deal from your company as any other companies promoting themselves at the Amazon dot com."
3,These mugs are huge!,I ordered a set of these mugs thinking they were coffee mugs. They hold 14 ounces so be sure you are aware of this before you order!
1,Not microwave safe,I don't expect a lot out of my mugs. I do expect them not to self destruct in the microwave if listed as microwave safe however. The paint/glaze used in the border & floral motif both are highly energetic in the microwave. Food can be ice cold and the mug boiling hot.NOT microwave safe.Not durable.A very overpriced and poorly made mug.
5,very satisfied,i love my new mugs. they are exactly what i wanted. 1 arrived broken & the replacement was easily obtained & in a very timely manner.
5,Decca recordings in France,"This collection consists of many of the Decca recordings done in France in 1935 thru 1938. For some reason, the Decca recordings in general are not being reissued. Most of the pre-war recordings on the 100 or so CDs available are from the French Gramaphone recordings. The music on this CD is of the same quality as we are all used to and belong in the collection of anyone who enjoys the quintet at its best. The only problem with this CD is the poor restoration of the records used. You will have to re-equalize the high frequencies to restore the brilliance to the sound and accept some surface noise."
1,Gordon McLendon,This book is wholly in error on basic facts. It was written after only a few interviews with people who did not know the subject well and who were not present at the events recounted. A total waste of money...even for a used book.
4,"Great storyline, writing a little off","For Babylon V fans, getting more on what is occuring on Centauri Prime is a boon. Londo, now emperor, was involved with the Shadows, but betrayed them, something that the Drakh have not forgiven.This book reintroduces us to some familiar characters, former Ambassador, now Emperor, Londo Mollari, his former aide de camp, now ambassador in his own right, Vir Cotto, Londo's divorced wive Mariel, and the one he kept Timov.The storyline itself was written by J. Michael Straczinski, but the quality of the writing was not up to the level of the story itself. For Babylon V fans, this is a must read due to the background info we gain about the situation on Centauri Prime. If you are not family with Babylon V, I recommend getting familiar with it before reading this book, because it does assume a familiarity with the general plot line of the series, particularly as they played out over the last two or three seasons."
4,Vir Ascendant!,"This work gives an extraordinary insight into the Drahk/Keeper relationship with the Emperor of Centuri Prime that is not to be missed. Both Londo and Vir's characters are so well described that you can somehow see and hear them as though one was watching them on the Television. The only real problem with this novel is the timeline: certain events occuring over a few B5 episodes are spread out over many months in the novel. But it is an oversight worth overlooking as the result is rich in detail, providing a behind the scenes look at many of the events in the final episodes of the fifth season of B5. One also begins to see the foundations of Vir's rise to power, his source of strength that will eventually lead him to take up his prophesized position on the throne. In a sense, one feels as though this trilogy will be more about Vir than Londo, as Londo seems trapped in a situation from which there is no forseeable escape. An excellent read."
3,Anoying sometimes but necessary,"as a Babylon 5 fan, I bought this book to cover the blank area that the t.v show left when it was over. The book itself does it in a way though it is written sometimes in a most anoying way. the thing that made me wonder the most is the excessive use in the techno mages. According to Crusade only galen was left behind as an ""active"" techo mage. the rest left as it was said in the show "" with a bit of luck, you won't see our kind again in your life time"". But then again nothing is perfect, and this book does fill the blank spots. it could have been done much better though."
3,If this is the case then Babylon 5 is a fraud!,"While the novel is very well written, and it shows a lot about Londo, Centauri Prime, and the Drahk, some fatal continuity errors occur, which undermine the enrire story. The book begins when Londo receives his keeper, but when Londo visits Minbar, at least 8 months passed and a lot happend, which doesn't fit in the 5th season on TV. At the end of the book, the time error is 2 years. Although the book is wonderful and plotlines very carefully worked out, such mistakes cannot be made. My reviewtitle is a very appropiate comment made by a narn a long time ago."
2,Not quite good,"First off I would like to say the authors like Peter David are what has killed sci-fi literature. This book, and the others in the series, only offers stale and emotionless sequence actions taken by the fairly flat characters in the book. It would have been more enjoyable as a two-page outline of events. At least then I would not have felt cheated."
5,characters faithful to the show,"Nice continuation of the show. Thoughts and tone of the characters match smoothly with the show. Unfortunately, this is not true with the next volume."
3,Could have been alot better,"As the title says, this work could have been alot better. It gets a 3 from me, due to the fact it has several good and interesting plotlines, but Peter David, astonishingly, doesn't pull it off. It's longer than the 3rd book in the Psi Corps trilogy, but it seems much shorter. Peter David introduces characters, that seem just plot hooks, and not full fledged characters of their own."
4,rite were the show left off!,It follows the last year of the Final season of Babylon 5 with pace and enthusiasm. The author definately has a great feel for the pre existing characters as you can hear them speak through the pages.
5,Insight into Londo Mollari's inner workings,"As a fan of B5, I can say that this book really helps to flesh out the characters even more than the series had a chance to do. We see Londo's inner thought processes, as well as learning how Vir Cotto gets on as the Ambassador to B5 for the Centauri Republic. Peter David's writing is excellent; I can hear the voices clearly in my head as I read the story."
5,Love it,"Great insight on Londo, his life, and his strugle against Drakh. This is begining of best trilogy yet. Every fun of the show MUST read this book. One of my favorite facts about book is it gives answers on questions that were left out on show."
4,Londo to a tee,"This book picks up right where babylon 5 leaves off, all of the characters fit in to JMS ultimate plans beautifully. Vir's development is great - I always wondered how someone like him could become emperor - I guess we'll see in part 2. I highly recommend this to a babylon5 fan. Someone who is not a fan I feel would be lost."
5,Good Product,I like the convenience of the self stampers and it beats writing on envelopes all the time!
1,Doesn't fit well,Fits too tight lengthwise! Can't flip the phone closed fully with case on. Tossed it.
2,"Frankly Scarlett, this book is worthless",I really thought this would be similar to other Peske and West books. Not at all! Awful read! It is now in my bathroom for entertainment there!
2,Unflattering,These are cheep shorts so I am keeping them to workout at home in when my husband is gone!. I would not be caught dead in public in these shorts - the pockets wad-up an create the illusion of thunder thighs. Yuck.
2,Pale imitation of his former genius,"This book involves the confusing story of two Americans trapped in a nameless Central American country during a generic revolution, seeking love and purpose. Unfortunately, it lacks the energy and narrative power of Smith's great earlier works - Death of the Detective, the Middleman and Toyland, now all out of print. Don't waste your time reading this pale imitation of Smith's former genius."
4,Good Product,"Worked as it said. Repaired dishwasher racks to like new. A little time consuming to put paint in each cap before you put it on, but none has came off.I will use again if needed."
3,"Good, but not what I expected.",I bought this hard case for my Koss PortaPro headphones. It is well made and serves the purpose. The only dislike I have: is too big for the folded PortaPro headset I have...I probably can fit inside two of this model - I wish they have designed this carying case in specific sizes.
5,Hard Case,If you want to have a porta pro headphone you need this. This will protect your phone on travels and even if you want to keep it on your table...
4,A tight squeez,Iwas given the phones that go in this case and thought this would help when travelling. It takes some doing to get them safely inside but it's possible. It should make then easier to handle on the plane.
4,Can't beat the price!,"Great little case that I've been using to store my Bose Headphones, which didn't come with one. Now I can just pop the case in my travel bag and not worry about my headphones breaking.And, best of all, at only $9.37 I just saved $151.62 over Amazon's regular price AND there's free delivery with Amazon Prime! This made me feel like such a bargain hunter even though it's only a $0.97 saving over the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of $9.99!"
3,Too big and expensive,"I've bought this case for my Koss PortaPro, just because it was the only I've found. Unfortunately it wasn't made at all to fit nicely with the Headphones. It is really big, and I actually could fit two of the headphones inside it!! I was looking for something compact, just like the Headphones is, as we bend it (I don't know if it is the best word for it...)!It wasn't cheap also... I've paid US$19.97. Plus delivery expenses, it's almost the price of the headphones now, on sale! I'm just using it because I don't have any more options..."
4,Perfect for My Koss Headphones,This product is just what I needed for my Koss headphones. It's shell is sturdy and has a strap link. Great!
3,"Ah, The Classics...","You've got to love a film that embraces the genres of martial arts, hip-hop and urban life. When the hero literaly glows with the power of his idol Bruce Lee, you know you're not supposed to take it seriously. When he enters with his authentic Chinese straw bowl hat covering his eyes, you know he's mugging. When Sho'nuf...the SHO-GUN!...of Harlem vamps it up, you know where Busta Rhymes got his mannerisms. In a time where ""Beat Street"" was supposed to be a timely film about the culture, here was one that gave a little more, asked a lot less and therefore provided a little more of a good time.'You are the Last Dragon; you posess the power of control.' Heh..."
5,The Greatest Movie of all Time!,"Oh, my God! I had no idea there were still so many ""Last Dragon"" lovers like myself! I absolutely love this movie! It gives me such a rush! I first fell in love with the movie at the age of 8. I was so in love with Taimak. I still know every line, and every song in the whole movie! I still light up when I see this movie on the television screen. It will definetely be the greatest movie, to me, of all time! Thank you, Berry Gordy for this masterpiece. Taimak, I thought you were exilerating! Superb! I would love to see a web site that is all about this movie. Anybody know of any, especially one with downloads of the songs from the movie, that was a great score! Bye for now, my fellow dragon lovers!"
5,The Last Dragon kicks butt (awesome soundtrack),"The Last Dragon is the best movie that I have ever seen. It has action and a sense of humor that is seldom seen in movies today. It also has one of the best soundtracks ever. If you have this movie, hold on to it because it is next to impossible to find."
3,"Motown Goes High Camp, With More Fu Than Kung Fu","Lovers of high camp will be in rapture with this 80's look at a shy Bruce Lee wannabe and how he finds the belief in himself through the love of a tv host.Sadly this film was a flop when first released and I truly believe it was because it was not what audiences were expecting at the time even though the DeBarge tune Rhythm Of The Night was sweeping the dance floors and the charts.The Last Dragon has quite a lot to say about our crazy cravings for idols and the fickleness of right over might or shut up and fight attitude.Not the best movie you'll ever see, The Last Dragon does have entertainment value though for those who take it for what it is, a stab at pop culture"
5,Great movie,"This movie is a classic. Great story, awesome action! A must see for anyone who likes old classics!!"
4,this isn't suppose to be Shakespear,"""Barry Gordy's The last Dragon"" isn't about some super plot or great drama it is a classic Kung Fu story told through the eyes of Motown. Partly a coming of age of a young Kung Fu master finding his own power to protect the people he loves, with great fight scenes and just a lot of fun. when you watch this movie, go into watching the movie knowing it is only for fun, and the song ""the Last Dragon"" is very catchy in the last fight scene. worth every second of popcorn munching fun."
5,I can't hear you!,"This is a great movie that I have loved ever since my father brought it home for my family to watch on video. This was my favorite movie and I have been looking for it for years. They should really re-release it on video. This movie was one of the first movies to showcase a African-American as matrial artist. This movie has it all action, romance, drama, and comedy. To me it's a classic"
4,For the Family,This is one of those films that the entire family will love. Most of the adults will like the musical aspect along with the nostalgic vibe the movie has. The children will love the action and comic aspect of the film. Vanity does a good job as leading lady. See more of her in such films as ACTION JACKSON and 52-PICK UP.
4,Hip Hop Martial Arts,"I wonder whatever happened to Taimak, the star of this film? One of the reasons to see it is him, because he's extremely easy on the eyes. This movie is a silly but pleasant timewaster with action and romance, and 1980's urban contemporary music. You also have to see the martial arts master ""Sho-Nuff"" to believe!"
5,Excellent,"My family really enjoyed The Last Dragon. Listening to each person, say their favorite lines with the characters brought back fun memories."
5,YESS I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this movie as a little girl and had been searching for it for a long time. Now my kids enjoy watching it with me. And the price was great!!!!!! Truly a classic movie to me.
5,This movie is the bomb,"I loved this movie, its funny and exciting, and the fighting is good. Taimak is just so fine and he is till this day. I really enjoy watching these movies with my children. They learn alot about when I was younger!"
2,I didnt get what i ordered,it was to my understanding that i would receive the last dragon in widescreen and it ended up being full even though the dvd box had widescreen on it. i was disappointed.
2,Average,at the time this film was better.But this Film Doesn't compare with Berry Gordy's Best films such as Lady Sings The Blues.Taimak was a Cool Brother who was More of a Michael Jackson Clone than a Bruce Lee Wannabe.Vanity? Please what Great Acting? Prince Brought out the Great Actress in Her?I Like The Ending WIth Smokey RObinsons song.Sho Nuff was funny but this film could have easily been a T.V. Movie of the week.The Effects are it's saving Grace.
1,A Definite Must Have In Any Collection!!!!,"In my opinion, one of the many classic 80's movies. I loved it from start to finish. I' ve seen it so many times, I almost have watch it alone or annoy the person I'm watching it with as I recite the dialoge. Great sound track, great action, great humor. I only wish I could get a copy."
2,The Glow,I can't believe I live in a country where mt fellow countrymen have put this #2 and Transporter 2 as the the #1 selling movie.It is SICKENING
5,Is the soundtrack still available? By Scott Lane,Hi I'm Scott Lane and i'd just like to say that I love Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon. The first time I saw it I fell in love with it. I wonder how can I find the soundtrack to this movie? Can anyone help me? It would greatly be appreciated. I get so pumped when I watch the movie and hear the music. Remember it's all about the Golden Glow! I've probably seen this movie over 100 times and I never get tired of it.Some one please get intouch with me on this. Thanks
4,Fondest Memory of Vanity 6,"I thought it was a really cute movie with all the spoofs within the movie. Also, I thought it was cool how Sho-nuff was...too bad he was defeated in the end."
4,An Absolute Blast,"This movie, produced by Motown's Barry Gordy, is an absolute blast! The hero, Bruce Leroy Green (Tiamak) idealizes Bruce Lee. He teaches martial arts as well as being a student of the arts, trying to recah the final level.The villians, campy, yet convincing, are Mr. Arkiadian anbd Show Nuff. One wants Green out of the way to strong arm Vanity to play music videos of his girlfriend. The other, Mr. Nuff, wants to prove he is the ""Badest"" fighter in Harlem. This movie is pure fun. It never takes itself seriously and thanks to the producers, the film quality is number one.A must see for all martial arts fan and others can enjoy this movie as well. It has wide appeal."
5,Fun & Campy Martial Arts Flick from the 80s,"I was only yeah high when I first saw this movie, but I remember it having a big impact on me. The storyline follows young Leroy, a martial arts student, as he searches for the master. He wishes to further his knowledge in the arts. However, he is bullied by the local gang leader, Sho Nuff, who challenges Leroy to a fight. Leroy refuses for he tries to be a positive role model for his fellow students and his little brother. However, when a major singer, played by then Prince protegee, Vanity, finds herself in danger, it is up to Leroy to help save her. The movie has some really hilarious moments and also is just an all around fun movie to watch. Revisiting it now after many years would prove to be interesting esp. as one sees some influences or references in some of today's favorites. Fans of martial arts, hip hop, or 80s campy films will definitely love this one."
5,About Time!,"This movie is great! All of the young punks might not get it, but for anyone who lived in the 80's, it will be a fantastic flashback! Old school music, karate, and a bit of fantasy all tie together seamlessly. The ""extras"" typically found on DVD are nearly non-existent however."
3,A cult classic with an honest rating,"Its really not that good of a movie. Dont get me wrong. I love this movie and bought it as soon as I found it. But it is very poorly acted, scripted, and even the kung fu isnt that memorable. It is really a B 80's movie. However, it is a classic cult movie by any standard, and for that it already rates high in my book. The tributes and references to Bruse Lee movies are hilarious. Its one you should get if you love campy 80's movies, or kung-fu and want that american experience."
5,I got the glow!,"Finally, I have been waiting on this DVD since I got my first dvd player three years ago. I love this movie and I don't care what anyone has to say. This movie combines martial arts, comedy and music to tell a story that could only happen in the BIG APPLE. Bruce LeRoy facing off against Sho Nuff to see who is the master. The 1985 movie has a good final sequence and all though a little corny at times that is part of its appeal. If I had ten thumbs I would give it ten thumbs up, but I only have two. ""When I say who's the master, you say...Sho Nuff!"""
4,Cult Classic!,"Who's the prettiest? Who's the badest mofo low-down this town? ""Sho-Nuff!"" Lines like this and memorable charactors that put this funk, kung-fu, cult classic on the list of Best ""B"" movies of all time is worth any purchase! It's funny, fun, and will entertain you for the hour and a half that it runs. Great when you Bar-B-Q and friends are over talking, when all of a sudden you notice they are slowly creeping over to the couch to catch a seen with Vanity 6, or to utter the words, ""Bruce Leroy?""...Enjoy!"
4,Great trip down memory lane!,"I used to watch this film to death when I was younger! Now, as a 30 year old, I still love it though I recognize it now for the camp that it was!It was, for the most part, action but clean fun! Not that I mind gore but its good to get a clean flick now and again. The story is about a high level martial artist named LeRoy Green, Jr. who is on a quest for the Glow. Along the way, he's challenged by a local martial artist named Sho'Nuff, falls in love with a beautiful music D.J. named Laura Charles (very well played by Vanity who is a minister these days), is chased by a manager wanna-be named Eddie Arcadian and showing his skills to other students!Its an enjoyable spoof on martial arts films done from an African-American point of view with obvious tribute to the late great Bruce Lee. The scenes between LeRoy and Laura have sexual enduendo BUT are not blatant as it is more of an innocent nature. Overall, a great flick to just get away for reality for about 90 minutes."
4,"""Kiss my Converse! ""","Cool movie from the 80's that's still kinda cool today. If they'd drop some of the dancin' stuff and replaced it with more scenes of Sho'nuff, the Shogun of Harlem, it would have been even cooler.You see kind hearted Bruce Leroy is the baddest kung fu guy in Harlem (so bad he even eats popcorn with chopsticks) and Sho'nuff can't stand that people think Leroy is badder than him. Leroy is all about inner peace and refuses to fight Sho'nuff. Then Leroy falls for the super hot Vanity, so Sho'nuff and a mafia guy kidnap Vanity. Now Leroy must fight. Hieee-ya!Anybody interested in 80's cinema has probably seen this movie before, if not you need to check it out. Hey, double feature it with the even better BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA for an overload of comedy kung fu action."
5,A Classic,"Barry Gordy took Bruce Lee and put him in the hood. This movie is a great reflection of 80's american culture and martial arts. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll watch it so many times, you'll know all the words to the whole movie(like I do)."
4,An Urban Take on the Japanese Flick Format,"I was exposed to many different films and music. I don't really remember when I saw The Last Dragon, but I know that once I saw it, I immediately loved it. It was a shame that I couldn't find anyone who had the movie in their possession besides my stepdad until I got to college. When I borrowed it from my friend and showed it to my roommate, who had never even heard of this movie, all of the identity I had with it started rushing back to me. I felt like a kid again! This movie is the epitome of the 1980s and it's exactly like those old Japanese movies we used to watch on Saturday afternoons right after Soul Train went off! It's got great 80s music, a positive message of finding peace & self-confidence within, a normal good versus evil plot, a villain with the greatest hairdo (who is also ""the biggest, baddest mofo in this town"") comedy, and Vanity! What else could you ask for?"
5,Z's review of the single best movie of all time.,"I am the soul brother like no other. Would you teach me some moves? You have just opened a fortune cookie without a fortune, written by a master who does not exist. Think leroy think. Get Up. The answer you seek is not written on the floor. Who's the master. Sho'nuff. Just directa your feetsa to Daddy Green's Pizza. Oh, I would like to peel this banana. Sum Dum Goy. Dance to the beat of the rhythm of the night. You sure look like a master to me. I need a body guard. You know someone to guard my body. Kiss my converse. Here is your pizza with bean sprouts. Sukiaki Hot sauce.Get the DVD now. You know you want it."
4,rocker,"we gave this to our grandson for christmas. we thought it an outstanding value for the $. it is well constructed and attractive. we were very pleased with the order, payment and shipping process. it came exactly when indicated."
3,Delightful but dated,"This book dates back to the early 60's and many of the illustrations and photos look even older. It is a very delightful work even with such dated material as the cutaway illustration of a passenger steamship. That in fact gives it some of its charm. It presents a dated French lanugage which is overly formal. Children, for example, address their parent's as ""vous"". Still it employs a high frequency vocabulary and builds up a useful vocabulary. I certainly would not prescribe it as a primary text but it is nostalgic look at the French and France of a bygone era."
2,Good for diving only...,"The watch hands are virtually indistinguishable at night, making it a poor choice. Good dive features, but I found the dive mode would automatically enter if I went jogging (sweat will activate it). It also goes into dive mode in the shower...not a good design. There ought to be some way of telling the watch, ""I'm at the ocean, NOW you can start dive mode.""If you want a watch ONLY for diving, this is a good choice. Otherwise, steer clear!"
1,Titanium bracelet,Ordered the watch and couldn't turn the bezel. Titanium bracelet is a joke compared to a original citizen titanium bracelet. This is some sort of cheap chinese bracelet. When i took the bracelet of it was directly possible to use the bezel. Should of stayed with Suunto. Then also you wouldn't have that problem with metric versus imperial.. and celcius versus fahrenheit.Come on.. We live in 2012. People do travel..a
2,"Looks nice, but problems on and on","I bought this watch October 29, 2010. It seems the battery is already in need of replacement, and the case tells me to send it into a Citizen repair shop only. Ok, I can do that, but it is a pain. It also stopped working as a dive watch when i was on a dive vacation, that is the dive portion of the watch. Now after only two years I have to send it in for service. The crystal also will scratch easy, not like my other watch. I see online where people are having a lot of problems with this watch, so not recommended."
4,A serious look at the New Holy War,"In Sex and Drugs, Wilson shows how drugs have been used along with sex through the ages as paths to mystical experience. He then demonstrates how the current ""war on drugs"", is really a holy war between different factions of drug users. He details many experiences of people whose lifes have been changed, for good and bad, by the use of drugs.This book is a bit more sober than Wilson's other works, and suffers from having had updates to the current edition inserted into the texts without revising the context to fit it. Otherwise, a good look at sex and drugs as something other than a reason to shred what's left of the Constitution."
4,Robert Anton Wilson Wrote the Review!!!,"while the book is almost solid gold, there had to be some room for the paper, hence 4 stars. But I have found out through numerous sources within the Very DISCORDIAN MOVEMENT ITSELF! that R.A.W. Wrote the one star ""Take Drugs to Achieve Enlightenment!"" Review. I hear they're planning to include it in a PBS retrospective, as an aside for his long career, that has ended in his tragic death from Pancreatic cancer."
3,Going where ?,"Class C movie. Acting,plot and story,all are overreach. attemptng to over comedy with mediocre acting performances producted a too sticky flick"
4,Mindy,"I really enjoy this book. I read it many years ago, when I first became single at the ripe old age of 50, and it was very inspiring. I lent it to someone and didn't get it back, so I purchased another copy. I do recommend this book."
2,"Underneath the glossy production...nothing new to say. ""Medium"" is definitely the message.","Kevin Roberts appears desperate to coin a new word for our already overwrought lexicon of corporate jargon - but in creating another book in what is clearly a strategic plan by Saatchis to seize some kind of 'ownership of tomorrow' - the author forgot to come up with any new ideas. Could Sight Sound and Motion really be the saviour of modern communication and advertising? Gee whizz. Don't tell Hollywood, or they'll invent the talkies.This book is empty and smug. I give it two stars because the layout is lovely - a fresh updating of the work that Quentin Fiore did for Marshall McLuhan in his ""Medium is the Massage.""But I found it a pity that McLuhan, in his books from the 1960s, has far more to say about today's media than does Roberts in 2006.For an alternative you might like to try:Juicing the Orange: How to Turn Creativity into a Powerful Business Advantage"
1,Idiotic!,"This book is idiotic! It might have been interesting if it had been written in 1937 (the year Walter Benjamin wrote the prohetic ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction), but even in 1937 the author's self-satisfied voice and cutsie delivery would have undermined whatever credibility the book might otherwise have had. Do not waste your time on this book. Unless you have been asleep for the last half century, you will find nothing that you do not already know within the covers of this book."
2,I don't get it,"This book was suggested by amazon to me as relating to writing effective web copy and web marketing.However, I found it difficult to understand and it did not give too many suggestions on web marketing, so I was dissappointed. I already knew the new media - web 2.0 stuff (youtube, myspace, blogs, forums, etc.) exists and is taking away from old style media (TV, radio, etc.).This booked seemed to only state the obvious that advertising and marketing has changed dramatically. You need to learn how to market using the new media. Find a book that teaches you how to use the new stuff rather than a book that just tells you that it exists.I can say one thing for the book. It does look cool and have cool photos. It would be nice on your coffee table and impress visitors because they will not understand it and will think that you do. I moved it from one to two stars for look and coolness."
1,"If Kevin loved himself any more, he'd have to be twins.","There is a very, very short bi-line article trying to get out of this book."
4,The Digital Revolution,"It's about time someone wrote something positive on the future of advertising! Television advertising has hit a dead end and this book recognizes the concerns and suggests doing something about it. With such advancements in technology such as high definiton screens and audio, why not take advantage of the situation? The book is a wonderful exploration through sight, sound, and motion and how these elements will change the future of advertising as we know it."
5,Great Choice!,"Excellent starter on human physiology for a bright 1st grader. Even the pre-schooler was captivated by the images. Only one incorrect use of grammar, easily edited. A sound investment."
4,"solid history lesson, and lesson in avarice","A very compelling history of the European tradition of porcelain making. Although it does plod along in places this is more reflective of the history than Ms. Gleeson's storytelling. I mainly picked the book up because of the ties to alchemy at the begining, and really I didn't expect to read much past that, but it kept me engaged throughout."
4,The Arcanum: The Extraordinary True Story,"I found the Arcanum to be a fascinating read, wether you care about porcelin or not. Gleeson is a great story teller. The book reads like a mystery thriller that you don't want to put down. I have given three copies to friends."
5,"Enthrallling, riveting ... porcelain? Who'd 'a thunk it?","I picked this up at a bookstall at Heathrow last week, started it and literally couldn't put it down until the end. Wow! I don't think I've given the history of porcelain five seconds' thought in my life, but while I was reading The Arcanum nothing could have struck me as more fascinating. Janet Gleeson is a born storyteller - and who'd 'a thunk *that* with a background in writing collectors' guides for porcelain and posters? Hello Hollywood - here's a movie waiting to be made! Sex, danger, intrigue, discovery, war, politics, envy, gluttony - hey, all seven deadly sins and then some. As God is my witness, I'll never ignore porcelain again!"
3,Pleasant Read,"Janet Gleeson is not a storyteller. This becomes apparent as she pops between explaining the arcanum, porcelain making, political strife and the lives of the people involved. The subjects are so compelling, however, that you will not mind too much. It is apparent, too, that she has a passion for the subject of porcelain making, and she does manage to infuse the reader with her interest."
4,Creative approach to teaching reading,"While these sets are not a complete reading program, they offer a good base for homeschool families with a interest in phonics-based reading. The stories are a bit silly, and the illustrations are well done. The rods are an enjoyable manipulative with many uses beyond the texts themselves. The activities included with each book extend the learning."
5,"Great, Morphly Piece!",My girlfriend loves this piece and it feels GREAT on the skin. It's really cute and fuzzy. Slightly smaller then expected but still of decent size. I assume this would be an excellent gift for a young child or anyone who loves Octopi. Worth the Price!
4,Handling the ignored spaces of Geography?,"Edward Soja is concerned in his book with what I would call the revival of the geographical discourse identity:after decades in which geographers focused on the understanding of Earth,nowadays we realise that there are a few geographical notions(space,place,territory,limits,borders,margins,periphery etc.)which are able to generate a major contribution to the raising of the new critical social discourse.Soja is one of those who enters this new challenging game.However,as I wrote in my book""Postmodern Geography and the Revival of Theory"",this new direction in geography runs some risks,among which the neglecting of the status of Geography itself.Edward Soja doesn't seem to pay proper atttention to this issue..."
4,"Good quality, not entirely what I was expecting though..","This is a great product. The belt is thick and very stiff which makes it great if you are carrying holsters as it does not bend. As a warming to anyone buying this particular belt, it is black not dark gray as it appears in the picture. Also, although the belt fabric is 2 inches, the buckles are larger and it does not fit in my belt buckle. Had I knew this before, i would not have ordered it. But I am keeping it because it is a solid product."
3,The belt is great but problem with buckle.,"I have purched many of Uncle Mikes belts and other products, I have always found them to be very good quality.For some reason on the first day the buckle broke, I'm shure this must have been a rare flaw, the belt is great I love it and was able to use one of my old buckles instead."
2,Not what it seems,The belt is very stiff which is good but it is listed as a 1.5 inch belt but its more like 2.25. The buckle is also very stiff. I had to take pliers to get it off a couple times now. Pay a little more and get a better quality
4,Good reference,"the Gold editon of Javascript Bible is a giant book with comprehensive reference to just about everything there is to JavaScript. I rely it as my primary JS reference, even though I have several titles on this topic, because I have been able to find more information in this book than others. Realize that a big book like this has both advantages and shortcomings."
1,Get the standard edition,"This ""Gold Edition"" costs (price) more and claims to add 15 chapters to the standard edition. In reality, these 15 chapters are on very arcane subjects, and nine of them just document some sample applications. Worse, to make room for the chapters, the Gold edition shoves the nine-chapter JavaScript Tutorial (Chapters 4-12) off the printed version of the book and makes them accessible only on CD. The basic edition of the book includes this nine-chapter JavaScript Tutorial in the printed book and (like the Gold edition) also includes the full text on CD. The basic edition even includes the 15 bonus chapters from the Gold Edition on its CD!Save (price) and get the standard edition. Note: my one-star rating reflects the Gold Edition packaging, not the content of these books. Also, the Gold Edition comes in hardback, if that matters."
3,be forewarned,"Danny Goodman is my favorite writer of JavaScript books. However, I would think that over 90 percent of the people who might consider buying this book should instead buy another edition. The problem with this one is that the JavaScript tutorial, which provides the most accessible introduction to JavaScript, is NOT included in book form. It is only on the CD-ROM. Therefore, for beginning and even intermediate JavaScripters, this book is more difficult to use than the other editions.I have the original ""JavaScript Handbook,"" which was the forerunner of this book. The Gold edition naturally is much more up to date and complete. However, unless you already own one of the earlier editions, I would stay away from this one and get an earlier edition of The JavaScript Bible instead. Those I can recommend without qualification."
1,"Ok, Lots and lots of info, but frankly, I don't like it.","Alright I'm pretty new to javascript, I was looking for basic guidance with 'if, then, else' statements and 'for' loops. About 12 early chapters of this book are on CD ONLY, in PDF format. I for one, don't want to sit and study a computer monitor, when I am going to study, I want it on paper! So, I opened the PDF file and found the sections of information that I needed, then went to print... Guess what... Mr. Goodman disabled the printing function in the PDF files. I'll tell you one thing, it really made me angry that I wasn't even allowed to print the info I needed.On top of that, much of the information in the book is awkwardly organized. I'm better off with using MSDN Jscript Language reference."
3,Just starting but finding bugs,"I am just starting to seriously use this book and am beginning to find a problem that I see in so many technical books. I am a programmer with over 26 years of experience in everything from mainframes to PDA's. It really is a big personal thing but I just hate it when a book gives an example that contains bugs and doesn't run. That's the case with this one. the evaluator.js and the ""trace()"" functions in the book both cause an error in any browser (well at least IE and NN). Doesn't any technical author run their examples and especially those used to debug the scirpts. I've also visited the author's web site and there is no mention of it there."
2,Didn't like having to refer to CD,"I returned this book after realizing that the book took out some fundamental chapters and put them on CD. I personally don't like having to go to CD to look for the information. I suggest that they make the next edition into two books, Part I and II and create a truly comprehensive Javascript reference edition."
2,There's a lot of JavaScript books on the planet,"Oh my god where was this man's editor? Okay, granted it's a reference material, and quite comprehensive...but in the abscense of any real entry point for even an intermediate JavaScript user, why couldn't there have been some more intelligent indexing?There's nothing that really lays out the scope of JavaScript and it's various conflicting Document Object models and allows you to find what you're looking for right now.One reviewer said he READ the 1000+ page book and found that to be very valuable, but frankly, there's so many really understandable Javascript books out there, with ALMOST the same wealth of information, I'd rather read one of them."
2,The Important Pages are Missing!,The book is a very fine work and quite definitive but the pages that deal with some basic concepts are only on the CD. The CD is protected so that you can't even print the material. You need a PC to get read this book.
5,Fits like a glove,"Bought it, swapped it for the old original I had. Fitted perfectly. No problems, I had it on for about 4 months now."
2,Didn't help keep the girls up,"I bought this because I have another Maidenform bra which I absolutly love, but when I got this one, in the same size as my other one it didn't fit right, it was too small and even if it would have been the correct size it seems like it didn't give me enough support."
5,"A more sexy-natural, wonderful look...","Being that my chest is not very large and on the athletic side, I have a terrible time finding bras that don't have edges standing out of my t-shirts and blouses.The scalloped lace (thin) edges are perfect and I get just the right lift with thin padding, giving a much more natural look than what's being marketed so heavily these days."
2,Scratchy and creaky,"This bra is not comfortable. It makes a bizarre creaking noise and the underwire really hurts. I wear it, but I'm not happy about it. The lace is pretty."
4,True to size and good fit,"Fist and foremost, when buying a bra online, the first consideration is size. I must say the Maidenform bra is true to size. As a demi bra, it its comfortable and gives a lot of support without it being too tight and unsightly under clothing. I do have concern about the quality though. My guess it wont last more than a year with moderate use. The price is right and I loved the free shipping and return policy."
1,Love Brings Long Lines,"A worthless film that borrows heavily from all the 80's teen dramas out there. It's filled with a typical plot line, including rivals falling in love and being chased by muscle bound morons. This stuff was popular in high school but there's absolutely no redeeming quality here, its utterly boring. Most of the actors aren't working, except a few of the goons who are doing stunt work. Avoid at all costs, except to analyze junk 80's clothing styles........"
4,Waiting for God 4,"As usual, this is a great look at older people and their enjoyable times. I love Tom and Diana!"
3,Good for the collector of music videos,"This video is a tribute to Dorsey Burnett and has a host of country stars. Very high energy performances from all who were on hand. Short comings is that with so many stars, not enough time was devoted to any one person. I recommend this tape for the variety of performers, and the rarity of some of them on video."
1,Major bug makes game unplayable,"This game has so much promise, but in its current state it's unplayable. There is a known bug (go to the FAQ section of the Konami website where they coyly hint at the problem) that prevents you from saving the game if you're using anything but a Sony-brand 256MB Memory Stick. I have a SanDisk 4GB card that the game won't save to. Trust me, there's nothing wrong with the card. The card, game and PSP were all brand new, bought the same day.I'm currently fighting it out with Konami to get a refund since the store I bought the game from won't allow you to return a game that's been opened.Bottom line -- if you don't have a Sony 256MB Memory Stick, you can't save, so unless you like starting from scratch each time you turn on your PSP, forget about it. Maybe they're working on a patch, but till then, stay away."
3,Not bad,Wasnt anyhing special. Once you get past a certain point everything the characters say they have said before and it just becomes dull.
3,FUN game but short play time,I had so much fun playing this game. but the thing is that you only play for maybe a hour very short game it would have been better if it was way longer then that. Cool game though
3,good but short!!,good game but very short! It would have been good if u could leave the dorm through out the week and stuff but it doesnt let u only on saturday to go on a date!
4,The Many Voices of Konfidenz,"Not only is this book intriguing in its storyline, but it is also intriguing in its composition: Dorfman uses several different narrative voices with great success. He puts the reader in the position of being the voyeur--watching the characters, as well as himself, the author. He also turns a voyeuristic eye on the reader, making you wonder if you, like the characters, are being watched. The novel raises issues of trust in a society where basic human rights are consistently compromised. ""Private life is an illusion in our world, Barbara. When you can torture one person, private life ends for everybody else."""
5,Functional,"I really like this product.I think it smells really good, but the scent is strong and lingers for a few hours. I feel like I have to use quite a bit of hairspray to get the effect I want (anti-frizz in a humid environment), but that may be because the bottle has a mister top instead of the continuous flow that most other (aerosol) hairsprays have. I think it has a good hold on my hair, and I will be using it for a while.Summary:-good hold-strong smell (I like it!)-feels like you're using a lot (but you're probably not)"
1,never got the right book,"They sent me the wrong book. When I told them of the problem, they asked me to send the incorrect book back to them, which I did, but they never got me the book I had originally requested."
2,"Lots of problems, few explanations","I was required to buy this book because of my Calc II class, and I must say it was rather horrible. As my teacher was incompetent and simply took samples out of the book and did them on the board, I found myself relying on teaching myself the material out of the book. Unfortunately, the amount of explanation in the text is... minimal, at best. It usually just says ""This is what you do, and it works because it's MATH."" The examples skip a fair number of algebraic steps--great, if you remember every bit of your middle and high school math classes, but very confusing if you forget anything. I ended up failing the class because I couldn't learn an adequate amount out of this book.I used a different book for Calc I, and this can't hold a candle to it. If I was unsure of something, I could read the start of a chapter and understand it. This book, more often than not, leaves me more confused than when I started."
2,Required for classes,"If I had to learn solely from this book, I would not know anything about calculus. This book is a great tool for professors to supplement their teachings, but not very good as a stand alone if you are trying to learn on your own. There are lots of examples throughout many of the chapters that skip crucial steps and of course the even problems are much harder than the odds which have answers in the back. I'm mostly glad that this book covers three semesters of math credit at my community college."
1,Avoid this book!,"This book is completely useless. The information that it contains is so vague that there is no way to learn anything from it on your own. The book pretty much relies on the instructor teaching everything. Today we learned about limits for the first time. Our instructor is not the best instructor, so she didn't teach us everything we needed. When I was trying to do my homework, I looked in the book for information, and it did not have what I needed. I even asked another instructor at the tutoring center for help. She asked to see my book so she could figure out what to do, and she said, ""This is all the information this book gives on limits!?"" If you are an instructor, do not make your students use this book! If you are a student and your instructor requires this book, find another class! Otherwise you will be in a world of hurt."
3,Mixed feelings,"If you're buying this book for a class, my advice is that you attend your class everyday, take notes and pray for an awesome professor. This textbook has terrible explanations for everything and the examples they use to help you learn usually do not apply to the problems they provide you. Do not buy this book if you plan on teaching yourself calculus. The only nice thing about this book is the large variety of problems they provide you with for each chapter. I think the chapters on derivatives and integrals will give you about a hundred problems each to work on."
2,"Used it for Calc1 , 2, and 3","It was a nice value, having bought the book new, that I was able to use it for three classes. The book itself, however, needs a lot of help. I agree that it does under explain and then do a lot of examples. The problem is that the examples are often nothing like the exercises in the book. They are often oversimplified or overly complicated compared to the exercises used as homework. The student solution manual is good for what problems it has. But with only every other odd, there are not nearly enough.Mathmatica is used with this book. Which is nice, if you enjoy using a computer program that is not as good at a TI-89 graphing calculator."
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,I cannot stand this textbook. My school switched from Thomas to this book last year and I have been suffering ever since. Very ambiguous examples that are constantly skipping steps. It is just not a good book to learn with. It seems to be written for mathematicians that are looking for a quick review on theory.The solutions manual makes me more angry. It only answers every other odd problem and even the solutions are skipping steps. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING I want to accuse the authors of cutting corners.
3,Great book for problems,I really don't like the book for trying to help me understand what to do. It is great for problems but not examples.
1,Does not include Wiley Plus,"If you are looking for access to WileyPlus to be included with this book, do not purchase this item.Even though the product description clearly states, ""Readers will also gain access to WileyPLUS"", they do not give you access. It does not say that Readers may also gain access for a fee. There is nothing in the listing of this book that says anything about purchasing WileyPlus separately.Amazon will not stand by their product description.In fairness to Amazon, they did offer to give me a refund. Since my son is at college now and needs the book, our options are limited and we will not be able to return it for a refund.Since I can not count on Amazon to describe their products accurately, I have no other option than to look other places for products."
5,not the best calculus book,I needed the solutions manual for cal 1 and 2. an engineer told me he thought it was a terrible book. it asks you to work problems that it doesnt teach you how to do.
5,Good Service,"The book was in a good condition (almost brand new). It arrived within promised period and there was no difficulty, whatsoever. Completely satisfied and definitely recommend their service to anyone. I am going to use my calculus book for three semesters straight, so it was a good deal too."
3,Calculus,The book does not give enough examples that a student can follow. Most likely the instructor has to do a good job of explaining steps.
1,Rudimentary examples at best,My university switched calculus books from Stewart to the Hughes-Hallett while I was transitioning from Single Variable Calculus to Multivariable Calculus and the differences to me were stark. The examples in many of the sections are rudimentary at best. When the first problem is significantly different from any example in the section it is difficult to progress. Stewart was much better at teaching in the exercises by taking one step at a time. Hughes-Hallett forces the student to leap on the first problem.
3,Cracked case,Both of the CD's that I ordered arrived with the cases cracked and I don't think it was from the shipping!
4,A subject of interest to every amputee.,"SYNOPSIS:""No one can be emotionally neutral regarding another person with a disability. The person is either rejected or accepted and the disability accommodated."" So states a psychologist who is himself disabled in a wheelchair. A loss of sexuality is the number one fear of those who become disabled. The first cognizant thought of a woman who becomes an amputee is ""will any man want me now?"" Indeed, society dictates ""NO!"" And the amputee responds to society's dictate. However that is not the reality. There are men who are peculiarly attracted to women who are unique. And various forms of disability can be seen as a unique feature. This book describes the psychological aspects of women amputees and the men who find them attractive. Must reading for every amputee, since the effect also includes women devotees who find attraction in men amputees. -- The author"
3,Not my favorite,"This workout was okay, but not that impressive. It was a little sloppy as far as how the workouts are put together compared to other videos. Lisa Rinna makes a few errors that could have easily been edited and redone in the making.The setup is that you learn a few steps at a slow pace for a set period of time, then a medium pace, then fast pace. Then you do the routine through at the fast pace for a set time, but don't necessarily complete the last part of the routine. In other words, once the timer goes off, she stops you wherever you are and that's it for that segment. That bothers me. I prefer to learn and complete the dance steps for the joy of dancing and having fun, not to get a workout over with which seems to be the mindset here. If you are looking for good ballroom workouts that are well put together I highly recommend, Dance with Julianne Cardio Ballroom, and Dance it Off Ballroom with Kristina Milova. These are challenging and a total blast!"
3,Ehh..,"The Ballroom Body Blast starts out alright...I tried to have a positive attitude. The DVD includes; warm-up, 4 dances (jive, salsa, samba, disco)and cooldown. Lisa first gives you the break down of the steps for each dance. After the quick overview of steps by Lisa, the dance is done with the group - SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST. The problem is the lack of cueing in reverse. This was frustrating at first, but manageable. When it was time for the samba, manageable went out the window.She does give you the beat prior to showing the steps, which was helpful. Several times, the camera angle wasn't on her feet during the dance - it needed to be! This will get your heart rate up, and you can at least learn the breakdown of each dance. I was disappointed in this as far as cardio fitness. I recommend this for more recreational uses =)"
4,Fuel Efficient.,"In the near future the price of gas is 40 bucks a gallon, as a result nearly no one drives. However a young kinder garden teacher decides to change all that and make a car engine that runs on wheat grass, he do not have much success before he accidentally cuts himself and discovers that his engine runs on human blood. Soon the young teacher hooks up with a sexy but shallow girl who will do anything to ride in a car, this lead to our dear hero having to fill up his tank now and again. To make things worse the government wants the blood car and are willing to kill to get it. What follows is a crazy, hilarious story.I really like this film. It is completely insane. This is more humor than horror and I laugh my butt of watching it. I really do recommend. This movie is a good example of independent filmmakers making the most of a low budget. Blood Car is funny, creative and completely hilarious, watch it."
2,not scary,"okay, here is a guy who makes a car that runs on blood. okay stupid plot stupid movie. it doese have some gruesome kils but i've seen better low budget horror films. this movie is okay for a first time director. but it's something i wouldn't buy."
1,What a waste of time,"This movie sucks. There was virtually NO GORE, it's filled with nonsense sex scenes to take up time because the acting talent and plot is so weak. No, it's not funny. Shaun of the Dead was funny, this movie was 100% dumb! The actresses are God awful ugy, with the exception of one woman and she is killed off within 2 minutes of her debut. The time just DRAGGED on in this movie I couldn't wait for it to get over with. I don't think they get much more overrated than this. Boring, cheap, stupid, and totally NOT scary, just CRAP!!"
1,Not all that good,"This book is a huge disappointment-it leaves out 80%of the movie,and the pictures are only so-so.I don't recommend this boring book to anyone who's a die-hard Poppins fan.All kids will do is look at the pictures to cure boredom,then toss the book aside and forget about it."
5,ANOTHER EXCELLENT PRODUCT FROM DAVID NUNN!,"I have been a fan of David Nunn's work for a long time. This DVD continues the excellent tradition. It's perfect in giving a bird's eye view of the sites related to the earthly life of the Lord Jesus. The chronology is very good, the photography perfect, the enthusiasm of the narrator appropriate, and the spiritual lessons excellent. I also appreciated this DVD being an ""extended version."" This DVD does not disappoint!"
4,Works for us,"Got this for the office because I know the Missing Manual series of books is exceptional. Accounting doesn't wind my clock, but this book has made it easier."
2,Not worth the money,"Waste of money. Music is OK, but video is silly. Save your money. Do this instead: 1. download royalty free art and space .jpgs, 2. load them into powerpoint and set slide timing for 25 seconds per slide. 3. while playing the powerpoint show, listen to Pandora.com set to an ambient station of your choice. You've got the EXACT same thing, but at better graphics resolution."
1,Do not buy!,"It was fast shipping. Howeve, it could not play with my blu-Ray DVD player. I am using the same DVD player to play all my blu-Ray DVD player. Expect this one."
5,Love Them,The item itself: I love these socks. My bike socks have turned into my pretty much everything socks. Comfortable and expressive style - how fun!BikeSomeWhere: I have made several purchases for myself and others via BikeSomeWhere. They always ship promptly. I've not had one issue with their service and look forward to many more future mtb'ing puchases from them. Thanks a ton!!
2,Inexpensive but not a good buy,"I have used this charger for several weeks now. The instructions seem to suggest that the charger takes a day to complete. After a day on the charger, the batteries seem to be charged OK but the indicator lights do not turn off to show that the charge is finished and the batteries get very hot to the touch. One would think that a charger should automatically turn off when the charge is completed, or at least indicate (by a green LED or similar) that the batteries should be removed."
3,a tad disappointed,I bought a couple of these and found the tab for the negative side of the battery is so weak that the batteries won't stay in unless you lay it flat like on a power strip. I was able to bend the tabs out with a fork tang to make a firm hold on the AA battery so it could be plugged in a wall outlet vertically.The other thing I don't care for is the red light. It comes on when you plug it in but that's all it does. It doesn't turn green when the batteries or charged or give any kind of indication when the batteries are charged.
5,eXtraTerRestriallY UpLiFtin!,The songs begins with a countdown...then kyra titles the song with her beautiful voice. The hip hop lyrics by deon blue is amazing. I bought the self titled album bout 3 yrs ago...this single is one of the best on the album...if u like eurodance/trance/rave whatever it is u like in that genre...buy this cd...it is worth having it in your collection.
4,Jane in her time and in ours..,"Ms. Johnson's scholarly book, which examines how Jane Austen was and is received as a woman writer, is a very thoughtful and lively one. I enjoyed it very much, and expect that it will influence future re-readings of all Miss Austen's work, especially ""Mansfield Park."" I will not be looking at Sir Thomas in at all the same way when I next encounter him. (I had already experienced grave doubts about Edward...)If you want a thought-provoking (though on occasion overly combative) experience of modern criticism of the Austen canon, this book will suit you very well."
3,Dimension E310,"My 4 year Dell extended warranty ended almost 2 months ago. I have had 3 notebooks since I have had this desktop, so I primarily maintain it as a backup and project machine; it still has Win XP sp3 on it. Actually my E310 is 3.06 GHz and came with 1024MB ram and a 160GB Hard Drive, perhaps because I purchased it in August 2006 when it was ending its retail life.I needed to run a MatLab program for a class I was taking at University and the graphics choked and I thought it had to do with the fact that it had on-board graphics so I went through the ordeal of purchasing an X1 graphic card as there was no X16 slots. It turns out the problem was that the Intel onboard drivers needed to be updated for the program I was using, which could have fixed the problem. However, for about one hundred dollars I purchased a HIS ATI X1300 X1 card, which has proven to have been an interesting upgrade."
3,Food for thought,"Artwork is definitely for a couple with children. However, I intend to use the ideas within my ""own paradigm,"" so to speak. I would use or adjust the wording, and, perhaps, decorate the sheets with my own inovations. After all, my husband, MY lipstick, with, of course, MY lips (for that one particular sheet). I hope this is okay with Mr. Covey, but, I have a sneaky suspicion that somehow this is just what he intended."
3,fast but flawed,"This cd arrived in good time but the case was cracked. It was well packed so I don't think it was done in the mail, but perhaps."
5,Wonderful Carlin CD,A great compilation of Carlin humor. I love to listen to it while doing chores or driving. Terrifically funny and astute social commentary too.
5,Forever Laughing,"Very sad news. Since I was a teen in the 80's, I grew up with the wit and wisdom of George. If there was ever one comedian I looked forward to watching when the announcement came out that a brand new special was airing soon, his was it. I will truly miss him - such a genius of the comedian world.Forever in our hearts and forever laughing."
5,Carlin,I bought this as a gift after having received it myself last year. Great collection of great stuff from a great mind.
5,Great Bargain!!,"I have long been a Carlin fan. I recently saw this collection in a popular mail order catalog, for $179.00, which dampened my enthusiasm a bit. I decided to look it up on Amazon, and found it for $75.29, and ordered immediately. I'm finding more and more items on Amazon, and have found their service excellent!!"
1,Run easily,Comfortable but ran the first time I wore them. Covered the run in nail polish and wore them again. They got a run in them the second and third time I wore them as well. I had to throw them away after wearing them three times.
2,Material not nice enough for price,I bought these because my favorite department-store brand hose was discontinued. The material here feels too opaque for the high price. The cheaper discontinued Bloomingdales-brand hose had a finer thread fabric. I won't buy these again.
5,Hose? What hose?,"No one can tell you have these on, but you--gives a sleek line, perfects legs and feel great--tall sizes are for long legs, not just bigger all over. I LOVE THIS PROdUCT"
4,Good quality,"I think I got the wrong color, but that was my fault! HA The hose are really well made and they washed well (on delicate in a lingerie bag). I will be purchasing more of these in other tones."
3,"Bloopers from around the ""WORLD,"" but not a ""WIDE"" selection","This is an average blooper selection. The bloopers themselves are pretty good, but the clips are quite long. I think of a blooper tape as being ""one right after the other"" mishaps. These bloopers tend to spend a lot of time ""setting up"" the bloopers verbally for the viewer. Since these are bloopers from around the world there is some explaining of the cultures where these mishaps occur. While it is interesting, it takes up too much time on the video and there are less bloopers overall. I just want to see mess ups, crashes, running into other team members, etc. Compile a bunch of these types of clips, set them to some good background music, and let me have some CONSTANT laughs!"
2,date approximative de livraison,"Bonjour,Merci de m'envoyer le cd dans les 3 semaines qui suivent ma commande.Merci aussi de m'indiquer la date approximative de votre livraison , j'ai payé 6,48 dollars us, il ne faut donc pas plus que 3 semaines de délai.Merci pour votre compétence.Avec mes salutationsGérard Doulet."
5,I was blown away...,...by this book. I have borrowed it from my local library several times and now I've finally bought it for myself. I love the pictures and the detailed instructions. I've tried a few of the recipes and they have all worked out very well. You simply can't go wrong with this book!
2,Better books out there,"My main qualm with this book is the same as another reviewer's. I find it unacceptable that there are only volume measurements in this text. These days digital kitchen scales are very easy to come by. Weighing ingredients like flour instead of shoveling them into a measuring cup is yields far more consistent and reliable results. There is no reason why the home cook cannot at least be given the option of measuring the ingredients by weight instead of volume.This book is fine as a collection of recipes (although a few could have benefited from further testing), but if you are interested in really learning baking techniques, there are better books out there (Jeffrey Hammelman's new book on bread, Pie and Pastry Bible....)."
3,Ok book...recipe was off!,"After reading some of the reviews about errors in some recipes, I decided against buying this book. Since I recently returned to college for Baking and Pastry Arts, I found this book in the school library and immediately checked it out. I was on the lookout for a new butter cake recipe and found a high-ratio butter cake recipe in this book and I could not wait to try it out. The batter look excellent and I was anticipating a moist, rich, buttery cake but this cake was extremely dry. Even with a lemon curd filling between the layers, I still could not save this cake. The overall book is great and filled with tons of information but if the recipes aren't great, then I can't see myself purchasing this book."
3,Disappointing for this dummie,"I found the first part of this book very informative. Being a person with type 2 diabetes, education is very important to me.However, the receipes fall far short of what I felt I needed. Who takes the time to serve Portobello Pate?Crab and artichoke dip. What in the world is yuca? These are not what the average house wife has on hand or even wants to shop for.These are not items I have in my pantry. Having a busy life style they just don't fit in. How often do I serve lamb to my family or veal? Poached pears in red wine, feta bruschetta, yogurt rice. No way."
1,not worth the money,"This cook book is just not worth the money. Not only are there very few recipes but the ones they do have are a bit too exotic with specialty ingredients. I was looking for every day recipes, things normal people eat and can eat each and every day"
1,skip it,Skip it. Really. Nothing in this book appealed to my appetite. Get the Diabetes for dummies book (EXELLENT) but skip the cookbook. Any basic low carb diet (south beach) will do. Just eat normal portions (KNOW YOUR CARBS) and you can have pretty much anything.
1,I know many people have said this before but...,"don't buy this game. No matter how cheap it is, don't waste your money. The original Metriod can be unlocked after you beat Metroid Zero Mission, which only costs about $15 more and also comes with an entire new game. Not to mention it is also unlockable in Metroid Prime for the Nintendo Gamecube.Let me repeat. This is game has been released about 2 other times with Metriod Prime and Metroid Zero Mission games. Not to mention both Metroid Prime and Zero Mission can be purchased at at least $25 dollars or less.Tsk tsk....shame on you Nintendo."
3,old school classic,love every iteration if the metriod franchise having missed this one now I have it and is just as good as I thought.
4,good,its pretty fun but i would recommened metroid zero mission it has the first game and the new version its pretty fun and hard have fun!
2,"Fun to play the original, but get 0M over this","Ah, the original Metroid. I love the original. However, this is a waste of money. Why could such a classic game be a waste? Cuz if you buy Metroid: Zero Mission and beat it (which actually only takes about 2-3 hours for an average gamer), you'll unlock this game. So basically you get 2 games in 1 with 0M. But still, this game is fun, insanely tough, and it's just classic. Zero Mission may give you all the updates to the Metroid series like wall jump and Speed Booster and combining of beams, but it's a cakewalk compared to the original. This is a good game, but if you want more money's worth, just get it with 0M."
4,Good but Redundant,"The only reason I don't give this full stars is because you can get it in Metroid Prime or Zero Mission.This game was one of the best Nintendo games. Don't even say anything about features in this game either, such as no wall jumping no beam combinations etc. If you TRULY we're a fan of this and bought it on NES when it was new, you were excited to see such a cool game.If you can't handle the difficulty or the controls (I beat it when I was 10 or 11 so I don't know what the problem is) go play your easy cheese Super Metroid where you can save every half an hour. Don't get me wrong, I love Super Metroid, but gimme a break Metroid is NOT THAT HARD."
3,"Don't get this game, get Metriod Zero Mission instead!","I'm not reviewing this game but let me just tell you that instead of buying this game get Metroid: Zero Mission. It is a MUCH better remake and if REALLY want to play the original get it anyway.If you beat Zero Mission (and it only takes a few days to beat) you'll be able to play the original! A few other people have mentioned this in their reviews, but I just wanted to make it clear."
5,By far the greatest Pearl Jam creation ever,"These two songs definetly deserve their own album. ""I Got ID"" is an emotional catharsis and Vedder's howling voice will bring you to tears. ""Long Road"" has the exact effect, but on a more tragic level. The first song stings with anger while the second leaves you breathless. You will never stop listening to this. Believe me."
5,"""I Got ID"" and ""The Long Road""","1. I Got ID 2. The Long Road Even though there are only 2 songs on the whole CD, it's worth 5$ because they're great songs."
5,Nice Songs,"i really like this EP. but i think they should've been in No Code. but it's worth every penny. Musically, i got ID, is like Given To Fly. it starts pretty slow, then it gets hard. and Long Road is Similar to Nirvana's All Apologies. Lyrcally. well. both have great lyrics that will calm you down."
5,the real name is...,"the real name of this single, is, of course, MERKINBALL. But if you are here you already know that, more than likely."
5,"Great EP that Screams ""Neil Young""","As said on the back of the EP, this piece is to ""accompany"" Neil Young's ""Mirrorball."" This is great little piece. The songs ""I god id"" and ""Long Road"" are both top shelf. ""I got id"" was a decent radio hit and it deserved it. ""Long Road"" seems to have been Eddie Vedder's favorite of the two, as it was re-recorded for the ""Dead Man Walking"" soundtrack with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, rather beautifully, and then again it was performed with the help of Neil Young on organ, on ""America: A Tribute to Heroes.""This EP is a must have for all Pearl Jam fans . . . it is well worth the money. It is really good to have the Neil Young album ""Mirrorball"" as well. They really do compliment each other. Pearl Jam plays back-up on the album. Eddie even sings on a track or two."
5,seekers-capitol collector series,"""Judith Durham"" & the Seekers Capitol Collection is lyrical, melodic and offers a variety of songs to entertain persons of all ages.All the best,Peter"
1,starter for a 94 plymouth voyager.,the starter looks great. clean and well built. amazon said it would fit my car but it actually didnt. other than the fact that it didnt fit im sure the starter wouldve worked fine. I cant say that though because now i have to return it.
3,It's Ok!,"Not as pumped up as I thought it would be, wish there was more movement, not so much stopping!"
2,"Poor quality of a work-out, but a fast delivery.","Don't waste your money on this, unless if you're really good at picking up movements quickly. I had just gotten it in the mail yesterday, but sent it back today. This is definately for more advanced users. They move fast, and don't even break down to show you what you're supposed to do. If you're good at things like this -- I say, go for it ... but if not, don't even worry about it, because it wouldn't be worth it."
2,very disappointed,"I was so excited to do this workout, and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The instruction is terrible, they don't teach you the steps, they just jump right in to the dance moves (many that I have no clue how to do), and they don't count either, so I was LOST!The music was terrible too! If there was at least good upbeat music to go with the workout I would have been more inclined to get through the workout.Bottome line... don't waste your money!"
3,Not as good as Bootcamp,This was ok. I am going to sell my copy. They don't properly explain how to do most of the moves. I am not a dancer so I was lost pretty much the whole time. I much prefer bootcamp or their body dvds.
2,Falls apart after the warmup,"This video is definitely different from any other workout program. It started out okay with a decent ballet warmup complete with their quirky comments and casual attitudes. Kind of a humorous, refreshing change - that was my first impression (and the reason it gets 2 stars instead of just 1).Once the actual workout part began, however, I could not stand it. Their lack of rhythm made it absolutely unbearable. Otherwise, I probably could have dealt with the poor instruction and often no warning with regards to the moves.Try Kathy Smith's stuff - it's quite good."
1,So so bad,"I got this for Christmas, and I'm so thrilled I didn't spend my money on it (and so sorry that my parents spent theirs). It's like a really really bad version of a cardio funk class - without heart, without polish, without rhythm, and without giving you a workout. The women are completely expressionless throughout the ""workout,"" so don't expect to be motivated by them. They also seem to have never viewed a decent workout video before. *I* could have done a better job. Sorry, ""we're not professional dancers"" is no excuse for putting themselves out there as fitness instructors when they do such a terrible job. They have no rhythm - though I have to believe that they filmed the whole thing without music and then tried to match up some pathetic music to it afterwards (""tried"" being the operative word). Also, I am not in very good shape, but I couldn't even get my heart rate raised. Skip this dvd."
1,Forget these authors already.,"Honestly, don't waste your time with these skinny bitches. It's really starting to be a joke now. What ""booty"" do they have to bounce anyway? They can't dance, they are ridiculous and are entirely too hokey to be taken seriously. SAVE YOUR MONEY and DON'T BUY this video."
5,"melissa and doug, how do i love thee","Like all Melissa and Doug products it is of the best quality and will last forever. I can't praise it enough, as always it is an amazing product."
2,Gave'em to the thrift shop.,"This puzzle is no challenge whatsoever. Bored both my 18 month old grandchildren. The puzzle pieces fit in separate compartments, (there is NO interlocking) and have a duplicate color picture of the puzzle piece in the bottom of the compartment. The pieces are thick and easy to handle but other than fine-tuning their motor skills a bit there is nothing much a child can learn from this toy. We were disappointed and sent them to the thrift shop within weeks."
5,Fun educational toy,"This toy is very well made, colorful, and a good learning toy. My 2 year old Granddaughter loves it. I recommend this toy."
2,No longer hand-painted,"I called the customer service and they said they no longer make the hand-painted puzzles. They only have ones with papers on. So if you, like me, looking for hand-painted ones, you won't be able to have them any more :(I have a two YO who enjoyed the hand-painted ones (she occasionally bite have them in her mouth but that does not affect them like the paper ones).I wish the makers consider having some varieties as hand-painted again especially that they are targeting toddlers."
2,Quickly A Mess,"I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off."
5,"Fantastic, sturdy first puzzle for toddlers","This Melissa & Doug Chunky Pets Puzzle is very well-made and toddler-proof. Sturdy (made of out wood) and with paints that are non-toxic and safe.It has bigger, chunky pieces that are perfect for a child's first experience with puzzles. The puzzle is large, and the individual pieces are cheerful pets that kiddos can identify and appreciate. Perfect introduction to puzzles. The puzzle is bright, cheerful, and very sturdy. Highly recommended for toddlers."
3,stickers - not hand painted!,"The pieces are easy for a toddler to pick up, and they are easy to put back in the right place (when you remove the puzzle piece, there is a picture of the animal underneath). It is a cute puzzle, although they could have had a couple other kinds of pets. I name the pets off to my kid as we put the pieces back in, and it would be nice to have more of a variety.The puzzle is not hand painted. It is wood, with stickers. The puzzle is still cute, but I think a toddler could easily ruin this puzzle - by tearing off pieces, or by getting them damp. If it were painted, the puzzle would be more durable and it would be something I'd hang onto after my kids grew up - kind of a big deal!"
4,Get a Broad spectrum of Urban Planning for the Beginner,"This book gives a broad spectrum of what to expect in the planning field, but there are a few flaws. One is that the book is not written for the technocratic planner, it is written for the beginner or someone who is not going to make planning their career. But this book will give the beginner a broad basis to start from and for this I do suggest the beginner to read this before they choose planning as a career."
3,Good basic overview,"I was thinking of enrolling in a masters program for Urban Planning, and wanted to get a better sense of what a planner did. This book offers a good overview of the field, and provides a basic understanding of the types of issues a planner might deal with. I would recommend it to anyone who is in my position, trying to learn more about the field. For anyone looking for more than just a basic, 1st level overview, this is not your book."
5,Textbook,"The textbook arrived just in the condition as stated. The book gives very good detail about urban planning. Where it was in the past, and where it should be going in the future."
4,Calls for an expanded edition.,"Of all the 18 or so books in my fly-tying library I use this the most. Perhaps this is because, like many fly fishermen, I am just getting into salt water fishing. And as a relatively new area there are many patterns and approaches being evolved every week. This volume is the best so far, surpassing the Kreh book, in my estimation, in it's clarity of organization and description as well as the photos. They next edition needs more recent patterns and a short chapter on new materials and methods. Incidentally, one of the bonefish patterns on page 22 has become my old reliable for freshwater black bass, taking many up to 5 and a half pounds. Look down in the corner."
2,"Since ""The Movie"" Flytying has been a hot topic -----","First, I have never written a book only read them. I tie my own flys for salt and fresh water. I do read a lot of books about flytying and found the material in this text wanting for the following reasons. ""In My Opinion"" there was----1. Not enough Detail on several patterns.2. For some patterns materials were shown on the fly but not described in the recipe ---- did they mysteriously become attached to the fly?3. The text also is available in a CD Rom that is worth the money.4. I should have bought the ""soft cover"" version then I would not be out as much money and it would have balanced better on my flytying bench.5. All-in-all I felt that the minimum elements were covered in a minimal way the result is a minimal product."
2,Not very exciting,"One good thing I can say about this book is that it's a quick read. I was expecting more excitement, more drama with this book. It was disappointing. The only remotely intersting character was Zack. This book is more like a Harlequin romance book, very little substance. I don't recommend it."
2,THINK TWICE!,"As a huge Stockenberg fan, I went right out and grabbed this book the day it was published. Please do not buy this book! If you want to read it, rent it from the library. It is not worth the time or money. It is not your usual Stockenberg suspense, romance, mystery. It is very boring and slow. You keep waiting for something to happen and the book just drags on. I finally closed it with 30 pages to go I was so disappointed. I will still buy her future books with the intent that this one was just a ""fluke"" as I love all her other books."
4,New fave author.,"Great if you want to just fall into a book and be taken along on a journey of love, a little mystery, relationships rescued, etc. I like her writing style. Although there's usually (in her books) the predictably strong-willed, independent female and the unbelievably handsome male, with some snafu that promises to keep them from finding the true love we all know they should be sharing, she makes it thoroughly enjoyable to read yet another such novel. Sometimes that's exactly what I""m looking for. Her books deliver."
5,Sand castles,Great book. Just enough mystery to keep you so you cannot put it down. I highly recommend this book for it's romance and mystery.
2,Nothing special,This book was nothing special. The story could have been better. There were several typos in the book. It really affected the story when the wrong type of SUV was noted (made me wonder if they bought a new one and I missed a memo). It again affected the story when the wrong person was named looking for the key. I guess I just expected better.
4,Sand Castles,"A very enjoyable novel. It kept my attention to the last page. It makes you wonder if money is truly the answer to happiness. It also makes mental illness take on a different perspective when seen through the eyes of a woman that had an extremely tramatic experience as a child. I cried, I gasped, and I felt with the characters. A good read."
4,page turner,I really enjoyed this book. The storyline kept mine wanting to turn the pages. This is the first from this author that I have read and will certainly be reading more of her books.
4,English Swing,An excellent album of English swing from the 30s and 40s.A style which was overlooked by American dominance in jazz but is every bit its equal.
4,This book has it all !!!!!,"Mix one part ""My Fair Lady"" with one part ""Horatio Hornblower"", toss in a little ""Gigi"" and you have this wonderfully sentimental, sweet, daring, funny and HOT story.The lovers actually like each other, but there are stumbling blocks they must overcome and that is the crux of the story: two likeable people trying to find their way in a critical world while trying to find their place in each others' lives.A special treat, at least for me, was the shipboard experience that made me want to join in the story. What a journey!By all means, read this book for a rollicking romantic good time."
4,Good Book,I really enjoyed this book. I am a reader that you have to grab my attention at the first of the book or I wont' finish it. This one did it.
3,Not bad...but not the best.,"I enjoyed reading A Lady at Last, but that's about as much praise as I can offer. It was ""nice"". Maybe too nice for me. I wasn't particuarly drawn to Cliff OR to Amanda, although they were pleasant enough characters. I have to say, however, that I totally didn't understand Cliff's resistance to being with Amanda. I understood that he had a reputation as a womanizer and that she wasn't really his ""type"", but once he realized how attracted he was and that she was in love with him...I was sort of lost as to what his hesitation was. And there was some tension with his father that was never developed to my satisfaction. All in all a pleasant read - but I wasn't as enthralled as I hoped to be. I enjoyed Joyce's ""The Prize"" a lot more."
2,Not Impressed,"I love Brenda Joyce's series on Francesca Cahill, so I am very familiar with her work. This book however made me want to skip to the end quickly. There was more hesitation than necessary on the part of the hero Cliff. The heroine of the novel, Amanda was an interesting character bent on living her life as she knew it. I think the novel is not one of Joyce's best and was too long for the content of the story. Many of the pages seemed like filler to me than packed with necessary development. Ah well. I will continue to read Joyce anyhow."
4,Great Story,This is one of my favorite Brenda Joyce books. This story just flowed so easily and had you falling in love with both characters after awhile. They aren't my favorite couple but I still love Cliff and Amanda. They just had great chemistry and were perfect for each other from the start. You really feel like you see her transforming throughout the book from La Sauvage to a lady. I couldn't wait to get back to reading this story and would suggest if you are going to start randomly in the series to start with this one though it's alway better to read from the beginning to see your favorite characters over again and see how they are living. I even liked Elle in this book much better than in her own story.
4,Are her leading men getting wimpier??,"This book had some terrific moments, but with the peaks, come the valleys. Some parts vapid, others repetitive. How many times can the man's loins fill and swell before he does something about it? Another quirk I've noticed in her last two books that somewhat annoys me is how often the hero's eyes fill with tears. C'mon Joyce, we still like real men, quit making them so soft. You'll notice the same pattern in Stolen Bride with Sean O'Neil's character. Aside from that, it had a good setting, plot and the characters actually got to know one another over a reasonable amount of time. I also like the way Rex and Blanche were subtly written in (teaser for the next de Warren installment). It wasn't a bad read, you'll know when your hitting a plateau and those pages are easy enough to skim."
3,An unsettling yet fulfilling read,"Frances lives with her Aunt, who moves around often - school to school, apartment to apartment. Frances is distressed but curious when her Aunt informs her that they she is getting married to a widow named Mr. Tyrell. She is not allowed to see the marriage, and later taken to a large, fortress like home. She meets her new family and step siblings, and discovers the family are part of a religious group preparing for Judgment Day."
5,BEST Book I've Ever Looked At EVER,"These tantalizing pictures of beautiful African terrain paralize me with delight. Once I opened this treasure chest of African glory, I could not stop. Cover to cover, backwards and forwards, this is by far the best hotel book I've ever had the priveledge of having my hands touch. This has a prime place on my coffee table, and heart. I'm going to Africa, baby!!!! And I KNOW where i'm staying!"
4,Exotic playgrounds for the affluent and fantasy for the rest,I really like this book. Kind of heavy and big. Not serious reading of course. Stunning photographs of places most of us can't afford or wouldn't want to. Lots of ideas for those who want to try to make their home look completely different than the norm. Author has selected diverse properties showing you that Africa has just as romantic getaways places as in Europe and the Far East.
5,"Probably the most important book of the century, bar none.","Food. Nutrition. Gardening. Vanishing species. Wonderdrugs. The environment. Our future on this planet, and ourability to utilize this great earth to sustain ourselvesnutritionally and otherwise is examined. Anyone who haswondered about nutrition, quality of food, and the effectsof our diet on our health will want to read this book. Notjust another health foods guide, but a captivating tale ofwhat we have been doing to our planet and where this isleading with an astonishing quickness through loss ofbiological diversity. Corporate greed seems to be at theheart of it all. But all is not lost. Heirloom vegetables,old varieties, and untold numbers of lesser known plantshold the key to a vast wealth that most people hardly evenknow exists. Read this book. You will be amazed."
3,Some antiquated opinions...,"The book includes too many of the author's opinions and too little history. For example, he indicts sugar as the cause of most of the health problems we suffer. I disagree, and wanted more information on sugar's importance in world economics and its cultivation.""Seeds of Change"" was disorganized and lacks the scholarship of a Kurlansky book. I wanted to read about the history of the plants and their influence on the world. Instead, I received a mish-mosh of opinion and politics."
2,Do not waste your time,This is one of the worst books on data mining available. It is not intended for marketers nor researchers. You don't need any knowledge about neural networks and -even worse- you will not learn anything. It only talks about the IBM Neural Network Utility. If you are a business man look for 'Data Mining Techniques' from Michael J. A. Berry If you are a math man looking for a good text on neural networks see 'Neural Networks' from Simon Haykin.
2,Sized wrong,"The seller of this item is getting a bad rap because of his supplier and he does nothing about it. The size XL helmetI received was no more than a medium, if that. I sent it back and heard no more from the retailer. I also ordered a pair of leather pants from this same supplier in size 44 so that they would be big enough to fit over my regular pants. What I got was a size 36 that was marked as a 44. I sent the pants back and never heard another word from this same retailer. I hate to mess up a guys business, but this is totally unacceptable. Lots of money wasted on shipping wrong sized items back and forth"
4,Choo Choo! All aboard the cutest train ever!,"My daughter recently took a ""liking"" to trains so we bought this for her 2nd birthday. This is adorable. All of the blocks are on sturdy wooden pegs and you can find a zillion ways to put it together. She LOVES it. Also makes a realisted ""choo choo"" noise and has a front LED beam that was a wonderful surprise to her."
3,He can do better,"Ha Jin excels in writing vignettes that are simply refreshing to the non-Chinese reader. There are, however, better choices. I recommend the other collections like Ocean of Words and Bridegroom, which are more original and better written. Skip his novels, they tend to drag with unnecessary descriptions."
5,Great Fit,"Nice and Tight, They function well as operator gloves. They allow air in so your hands don't all sweaty and hold up well to vigorous use."
3,meh.,fingertips started fraying after 1 week.not very much grip.difficult to write with a pen for example.i prefer the hatch duty gloves to these.
4,"Good, but lacks protection","If you're going on rough terrain (rocks/etc) you might want the M-Pact, M-Pact 2, or M-Pact 3. Otherwise, great for everyday use."
4,Accurate sizing - works well,"Mechanix makes great gloves, period. The sizing is accurate; I generally wear a large glove and the fit was dead on. The only thing I didn't like was the location of the velcro strap that goes around the wrist. It straps right across your wrist and slightly impedes your dexterity. Not enough of a problem to return them, just leave the strap a little loose and no worries."
4,Fantastic,These gloves are fantastic if you want to protect your hands while working. From wood to metal they provide a nice layer of protection without hindering you too much while working. The one con that I see is that these gloves are thin so they may not last for a long time or under harsh conditions.
5,Love these gloves,I bought these gloves to help move a relative and I use them for other light tasks. They are very comfortable and fit to size nicely. They are durable for what I was using them for and in the 90 degree weather they weren't too awfully heavy. After a very long weekend of heavy use they haven't shown any signs of significant wear like some of the cheap generic ones from the hardware stores. I would recommend these gloves for light to medium duty tasks.
5,Mechanix Gloves,I bought these for my dad and boyfriend. They both loved them. They are also good to use when you go dirt bikin'
4,Good working gloves.,"These are nice working gloves, tree cutting mainly and not a stitch out if place. Thin webbing between the fingers let your hands breath but can cause them to get cold."
3,Doesnt feel right,"The quality of these gloves are different from the past and the fitment is different, runs really big. XXL at the local store fits my hands snug and perfect but these fit like XXXL. Covert color is real nice all black, cant find these in my local store and for the price shipped cant be beat."
5,Save your hands while you work,"I've purchased several pairs of mechanix wear gloves for my husband in the past. He works on both of our vehicles on a regular basis, and these really help save his hands from all of the injuries that seem to come with working on vehicles. In addition, they keep his hands clean while he works. These are durable, but need to be replaced approximately every 3-6 months depending on how much you use them. The coyote color is great for military applications."
2,"Good gloves, but don't last long AT ALL","These gloves fit VERY good and are extremely comfortable, but I just don't want to buy a new pair every 2 months... These things get holes in the after about a month and expand drastically until the point where they are unusable... Overall, they are amazing gloves, but need to stitch them better so they don't get holes as quickly!!!"
4,"Good, well fitting glove.","I like these gloves. They are the second set that I've owned and they fit my hand well. I suggest you use the sizing chart on the mechanix website. They are decently warm but I would not suggest to use them for any extended periods in very cold temperatures as there are better options for warmth. They seem to wear pretty well and have held up so far in the month or so I've owned them for medium duty work.My only complaint, and it's kind of big one is that I cant wear them when using my iphone. Why don't they just put a conductive material in the fingertips so it would work? I have no idea why they wont but it would bring these gloves into the 21 century."
4,Great tactical Glove.,"Love these gloves. I had a pair of Mechanix gloves a while ago but have seemed to have lost them. I thought this pair was the same as my last pair that I loved so much, they were not, however. These gloves are much thicker than the previous pair that I had. This is either a pro or a con to somebody out there. If you like thinner gloves, I suggest something else, if you want thick gloves then these are a great choice.Overall I give these gloves a 5/5 stars."
5,Best glove I have tried.,"I have tried every other glove on , and none fit this well. It might be I have odd shaped hands , but this glove is quality. I wear it everyday and they last. I can feel what I am working on. They clean easily. Great purchase. Worth the $20."
4,Tough,"Tough, thick, and great for outdoor activities. Do not work well with rope climbing during CrossFit workouts. The palms are too soft and slick."
3,Overrated,These gloves are easy to take on and off. It just take a flick on the velcro but that easiness also tends to cause to velcro to unstick easily. The material is fraying a little bit after just a few weeks of occasional use. They are decently comfortable though.
5,Great for Mountain Biking,"I bought these because I needed some sturdy, flexible, breathable gloves for riding the trails on my mountain bike. These do the job perfectly, and they cost less than gloves made specifically for riding!I would never buy any other glove for mountain biking. Since these are meant to take a beating while doing work, they are plenty durable for riding. They don't get too hot either, which is nice on hot days, but they keep my hands warm when I ride early in the morning.Several spills on the mountain bike in dirt and rocks and they aren't worse for wear!"
3,"Overall good, minor defect","Got the gloves quick (got to love prime) took them to work the next day and as soon as I put them on noticed the velcro strap had pulled about three stitches out! While I am disappointed in that aspect of the quality, overall I like the feel of the gloves and the comfort/protection ratio. I have big hands and the xxl fit just fine. I will try and fix the stitching problem my self, and am willing to order another pair when these wear out. They are handy for general work when I don't want bulky leather gloves and don't need latex gloves. I would recommend them to someone with the warning about the stitching. I hope my next pair is better assembled."
5,excellant,"As someone who was too young to have seen Hopalong Cassidy on the screen.. I was born in 1951..... there was a reluctance on my part to purchasea product from a period that can be called the first wave of westerns.I am so happy to have been proved wrong in this.Everything about this product is put together lovingly, the film is crispand the sound faultless, and I am now a fan of Hopalong Cassidy.This is different from programs such as Wagon Train or Rawhide,however there is something about the calm attitude of Hopalong Cassidy that invites viewersin and leaves one feeling happy.A figure dressed in black riding a wonderful white horse named Topper, wearing a 10 gallon hat carrying twin 6-guns and as he walksa jingle is heard from his spurs,not forgetting that interesting necktie.I have a very extensive dvd collection of early television,Hopalong Cassidy in my opinion is up there with the best."
4,World Traveler,We needed a bag that would take my daughter to Mexico City; and this one fit the bill. It has places for everything including passport so it was not necessary to carry her purse. The construction is rugged so I think it will hold up well. What it lacks in style it more than makes up for in its function.
5,3COM Gigabit Router ROCKS,"This router rocks. I can't say enough good things about it. My home network is a bit more complex than the average home network as I'm running hosted websites, Media Center access from every TV in the house, Linked DirecTV DVRs in every room, multiple XBOXs that each host multi-player games, 5 database servers and another 20 or so devices like laptops, desktops, iPhones, iPads, wii's, all running at the same time and communicating with each other 24/7. I moved to this router because I couldn't take another minute using the Linksys 600N wired ports and the LAN constantly dropping and the issues that would create. I also rarely got Gigabit performance from those wired ports. After moving to this gigabit router, I haven't had a single LAN issue, and simple file copy operations have seen a 5 times performance improvement! Well worth the investment, especially if you have a lot of things running through your internal LAN and/or devices that talk to each other."
4,"Good unit, great price",The unit works great. Needed a gigabit swtich and settled on this one based on price and reputation. The configuration has the ports and power plugs on the back and the display on the front. It would be nice to have all on one side to make it a little easier to install but that is personal preference.The feedback you get on the display is really nice. Very easy to read and determine which devices are connected as 100 or 1000 megabit.The unit seems to run pretty warm. I tested it's AC current draw with my volt meter to see how much juice it would be using. It was pulling approximately 0.09 amps at 120v. I also have an 8 port netgear gigabit swich to compare and draws 0.03 amps so it so it definitely draws a decent amount of energy relatively. Both units were at idle with nothing but power plugged in.My only real gripe is the fan. It is very loud - wouldnt have mind something a little quieter so I may have to look into replacing it after i break it in more.Ernie
3,JetSpa footbath,I have only used it once so far. It is kind of loud and the pedicure attachment are akward to use.
1,Poor quality,"I expected Homedics BL-200 Jet Spa Footbath to be durable and at least last for about 4 years.I sent this as a gift to my closest friend. However, it started leaking by the second use. My friend didn't tell me for the fear of hurting my feelings. I found out during my visit though. I felt bad 'cause the return date has expired. I have lost confidence in this brand. I have other brands that I and my mother are using over 3 years now. They are still in good shape.So beware customers don't go for this brand."
2,Not what you think,"This item is not what you think. From the take I got on it by reading and looking at the picture, I thought it was rotating attatchments, but it's not. I didn't want to do the work myself. It doesn't have heat. I also was not impressed with the bubble action. It wasn't to massaging. And it's a little messy, water spills out the back by your heals. I'm gonna keep it because I'm too lazy to return it Plus I already used it to try it out so I don't think I can anyway."
3,Not bad for the price,"This product works as advertised. I have not used the attachments, but it is nice to have them if I decide to.Pros:It is quiet.Easy too use and set up.It is not huge, so easy to handle and easy to store.It is just about the right size. Not too small.Decent value for the price.The on/off buttons are in a convenient place.Cons:It does not heat or keep the water warm.The jets are not at all powerful, by any means.Wish the ""max fill"" line was at least an inch higher, as it is kind of shallow.Do not fill above the max fill line. It WILL leak."
4,Overall good product,"I love the portability factor, the attachments and the jet action. It would be a better product if the water could be heated; it doesn't maintain the water temp as long as I would prefer but I am very pleased with the product overall. I would recommend it!"
1,JUNK. Leaked - A LOT - on first usage.,"It's ridiculous how hard it is to find a bucket big enough to hold my feet. I was assuming the bubbles and jets would be nonsense on this thing, but i DID expect it to hold water. My mistake. LOOK ELSEWHERE."
4,Very relaxing home foot bath,The Handle is great so are the settings. Just has a hard time keeping the water warm.But overall I like this product and is what I was looking for.
4,For Tweens or Simple Adults,Bought this foot spa for my 12yr old daughter. Its a great product for tweens or others with simple needs as the jets are not powerful and the attachments do not spin. It keeps the water as warm as all the other spas out there...I find that in regards to heat they all work about the same. Definitely not for high maintenance individuals.
1,complete junk,"On the first use this thing leaked all over my clean carpet. No really, I had it steam cleaned not 3 months ago. How is it possible that a foot bath can leak? I don't know. There are two slots on the bottom and water was pouring out of one of them. I would have paid to not buy this."
3,"It does the job, but the noise is too loud.","It gets the job done, however due to the high noise level, we avoid using it. It's way too loud."
3,It works; Not what I thought,"I purchased this spa because I worked on my feet all day and they would hurt so badly when I went home. The heated featured only maintains the temperature; so the water has to be hot when you put it in. The part on top where you can put the pumice stone doesn't spin on its own so it's not very functional. The massagers at the bottom though are amazing. Overall, it served its purpose."
3,Where are the DEEP tubs?,"I've looked everywhere but cannot seem to find a DEEP tub foot massager. I'm talking one that comes up to my knees (or close). I've found several produced overseas by chinese and korean manufacturers, but none of which are sold individually or that are available here in the USA. Surely I am not the only person desiring something that affects more than just my ankles."
2,"Lack of information,for HoMedics footbath use restrictions.","I purchased this product to treat my feet. I had intended to use it for an Epson Salt foot bath.I did not notice any notations on product ad on your display ad. After receiving the product, I went to HoMedics web site to registerthe product, I decided to check for more information as to usng the product. I found that you can not use Epson Saltin this product. It causes corrosion of the jets. Only certain kinds of oils can be used.Had I have known this I would not have purchased this product."
5,A powerful and moving tale,"This incredibly moving memoir by one of Israel's greatest living writers, a child survivor of the Holocaust, will have you on the edge of your seat until you've read the last word. Very highly recommended."
3,disappointing,"Way too short on details and specifics. Apparently the author's memories of the Holocaust are still too painful or repressed. I don't need to know all the horror of it, but expected much more of an eye-witness account."
4,A bit of Trivia regarding Steven Seagal,"As one earlier reviwer mentioned, this film showed aikido long before Seagal made it commonplace on U.S. screens but actually STEVEN SEAGAL WAS THE FIGHT CO-ORDINATOR AND COREAGRAPHER FOR THIS FILM!! It's true!! Toshiro Mifune was shocked when he saw Seagal on the first day of filming and reportedly grabbed a phone to complain and express his utter disbelief that some big gaijin had been sent by the Martial Arts Dojo he had personally selected to handle the fight scenes.....instead of coming himself the Teacher had sent his best student, Seagal.He bluntly said as much to the stunned Mifune and then hung up.Mifune decided to bide his time and see what the young giant was capable of......By the time the film wrapped Mifune's concerns were long gone and he was well satisfied the intense action scenes would thrill and satisfy his fans and the wider world.That this film has not yet been formatted for DVD is a crying shame"
4,Little-known samurai flick works pretty well.,"Any movie with Toshiro Mifune is worth seeing if you're an action fan. Scott Glenn adds his abilities, both as an actor and as an athlete. While the script isn't what you might call overly original the movie is worthwhile for any fan of the genre. Something most people don't know is the name of the martial arts choreographer of this one. At the time he was a successful sensei at his own aikido/kenjutsu dojo. The master in question?.....Steven Seagal."
3,"err, well..","I am really big into meditation, and exploring new avenues of approach. I got the 'Dance of Shiva' DVD out of pure awe and curiousity.I watched it through a few times.. I still don't really understand HOW the dance really works on the energetic body.what really, really turned me off after I bought the video is that the creator of the DVD says that the essence of the dance, or the real MEAT AND POTATOES doesn't really come in until the third stage of the dance.This really blows because there is no access to this material, outside of finding someone to teach it to you in person.So, once I heard that, I decided to completely blow the system off. I might as well learn a tai chi system, or something. I do appreciate the addition to my library, though, and wouldn't be surprised if it ever turned into the 'tai chi' of the future... if the rest of the system was ever released !!"
2,Cheap,These are REALLY cheaply made. The metal is inconsistent. It bends in random places and seems to crack. The side screw holes aren't aligned with the direction the fixture can be adjusted. I hard to twist it and the metal paint broke around the seam.It looks so much better in the picture....it arrived in a third-world looking box with Mexican news paper stuffed everywhere. Strange...
3,In need of new edition,"I read this book as part of a Master's degree program at Chapman University in organizational leadership. It illustrates that teamwork is essential in the late 1980s -- the book has copyrights of 1990 and 1996, still in first edition. At one point the author actually writes, ""As we move forward in the 1990s..."" While I know the examples should still largely hold true, it lacks credibility for me. After all, we've distinctly moved to a global marketplace with global and virtual teams far beyond the understandings of the 1980s; this book cannot possibly speak to these points in any meaningful way. The most current example I spotted is 1988. Traditional undergraduate freshmen were born that year, so this book must truly appear ancient to undergraduate students."
4,OKAY not great,"We have a dog with very bad allergies and have tried everything to stop his licking/scratching, etc. THe only thing that works is a shot he gets once a month. Other than that he's pretty miserable. Bought this based on the reviews and it helps to some degree. Not a cure but does seem to give him a bit of relief but not for long."
4,INNER PATHWAYS is Devine,"Diane Toland has come up with a great method for self-discovery with this book. Using the Tarot's mentors as references to the different aspects of the self, we are able to take a good look at our strengths and weaknesses. An easy and enjoyable book to read, Diane presents a step-by-step plan to improve ourselves with what we have discovered.You don't have to know anything about the Tarot to benefit from this book, and it doesn't matter what your religious beliefs are. Instead of using the Tarot as a ""fortune-telling"" device, Diane presents it as a tool for us to create a better reality for ourselves. The affirmations are great,too. Highly recommended."
2,gangster chronicles,"I got suckered in for this dvd, thinkingI was goiing to get the TV seires and got a doc.dan"
1,"NOT AS DESCRIBED, no michael nouri in this one.","this is a documentary on the mafia. NOT the TV series.No Michael Nouri, No Jon Polito. SERIOUSLY WRONG PRODUCTDESCRIPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This is not the movie that is advertised,"This is the first negative experience I have with Amazon during years.It's documentary, but description for 1981 famous Richard C. Sarafian TV series."
1,not what i wanted,"this is not the mini series made in the 80s, but a below average doco on the mafia. i also purchased this same dod on amazon.uk as it appeared to be different, but it was the same crappy doco. does anyone know where to find the mini-series?"
1,WTF!?!?,"Yeah, this is exactly what I DID NOT WANT! Thanks Amazon.. I don't think I'll ever purchase anything through you ever again.. keep the less than 10 bucks ya tardos! The one I ordered said that it had the actors and director and write information just as the TV Series. The ""TV Series"". How about you guys learn to fix your information on your site before misleading more people into buying something other than what they wanted.. and oh yeah.. don't bother filing a complaint.. it seems they pay them no mind what-so-ever.Bye bye Amazon.. you're less than trustworthy"
1,"This is the right title, but wrong product.","I order THE GANGSTER CHRONICLES with Michael Nouri, Joe Penny and Brian Benben. A NBC television show, not some documentary about gangsters!"
2,The Ganster Chronicles,"Wow. I bought this movie thinking that it was the wonderful television series.To my surprise, it was a documentary, not the television series.I'd like to have the television series. Amazon, can you help me and all theothers, who were fooled and nlol (not laughing out loud)???"
2,Wrong One,"Twice I ordered the VHS version, thinking it was a collapsed version of the movie series; it wasnt on dvd yet. The second one had, somehow, not seemed to be a documentary, but it turned out to be. I have the 1981 tv series of Gangster Chronicles starring Michale Nouri, Joe Penny et al in VHS. However, I bought it dubbed in the 1990s and the quality is not very good. I badly want the complete series on DVD. WOULD AMAZON PLEASE TRY TO GET IT!Please use your ingenuity; it should be possible to get it, if not from the original source or the tv station/s who serialized it, then from someone who has a good copy on VHS. It should be possible for AMAZON to render it in DVD form.I might add that it does seem that Amazon does now state with the item that it is a documentary and not the original series. That is important. I have now learnt that the TV series was run on NBC. It should not be impossible for Amazon to get it. Feedback from them as to their intentions concerning our pleas would help."
5,Excellent brief book to give to a teacher or parent,"I am an experienced reader on both language processing and expressive language disorders. I found this book to be a great concise manual to hand to a mainstream school teacher dealing with a child with processing issues. It's not too long, and it's a relatively clear and functional manual that doesn't become overly detailed or heavy. The only problem I can say is that it's a little pricey for the size, but there is something to be said for brevity - it gets straight to the point."
4,Good work glove,I like the fit of the Mechanix work gloves. They afford a lot of dexterity.The shipping was high at $6. Otherwise I would have given this item 5 stars.
5,"Enjoy Using It, Enjoy Looking At It","This is a beautiful and well balanced fountain pen. The iridescence of the abalone shell (Raden is the the abalone shell treatment in japanese pens) looks like the cosmos fading into the infinite blackness of space. I probably roll the barrel under my reading lamp, mesmerized by the shiny bits of abalone shell, more than I actually write with it!About the unorthodox pen clip position... it doesn't interfere with my grip. On the contrary, I feel as though the grip helps me hold the pen correctly. Your mileage may vary.The fine gold nib is superb, and ink flows freely in a clean gapless 0.5mm'ish line, regardless of stroke speed. I have another Vanishing Point with a medium nib, and I much prefer the fine nib. The medium nib is too fat for my smallish handwriting, and I like to write densely in smaller 5x7 inch journals.This pen is one of the nicest, if not the nicest, things I own. Perfect."
2,OK for the price,"Optics not the best. Not as clear as I would like. The 7X was more foggy/cloudy than the 3X. Field of view was wanting but price is ok. It just needs a bright daylight environment for 7X to really be clear enough. Like I said, price is ok. I would not go varmint shooting with it but paper targets would be ok."
3,Not bad.,"A slasher flick with more action elements than suspense elements, really, and a definite pull away from horror and toward mystery. This unfortunately makes it less successful than it might have been as either (a horror film or a mystery) and the ""twist"" is pretty standard for a horror film (and strains credibility).But the acting is above par as are the overall production values, and there isn't a lot of padding--there's something of a story with characterization and so on rather than a series of murders held together by nothing.One could certainly do (much) worse in picking a slasher film from this era."
4,"Fun slasher movie, and a Video Nasty","What a surprise this is a video nasty. I'm pretty sure this isn't the uncut version, if there is one, but it's still worth seeing this DVD for a good transfer. A lot of heads get cut off in this movie, but it's too bad you don't see it actually happen (hence the issue of being uncut or not) but everything else happening in the movie is engaging to watch, especially for a guy who's scraping the barrel trying to find new old school slasher flicks to enjoy. I honestly enjoyed watching this movie and hope an even better version comes out with all the juicy scenes intact.Also, a good scene in this movie involves beef stew and the search for a severed head. Enough said!"
4,a cool slasher flick,"this movie was cool when i saw it in the 80's and it's still cool now.ok,there are more bloody,more violent slasher movies from the 80's out there,but this is pretty damn interesting.it's a shame this movie isn't on dvd.give it a chance."
3,Surprisingly good 80's suspense thriller ...,"I was pleasantly surprised by this flick, even though I figured out who the killer was rather quickly. This is still an extremely watchable film."
2,Not very useful,"I don't leave 1 star since this thing works afterall, though it may take forever to get a clear GPS signal which is always weak. You probably don't want this GPS signal receiver if you have any other choice."
2,No answer,I purchased this book to get one side of this issue (supersessionism) but was disappointed. He has an ax to grind and does so.
4,Israel: the missing link in systematic theology,On the plus side: This book clearly demonstrates that most of Christian theology today in respect to end times prophecy is in error due to its roots in replacement theology [the view that the Church is Israel].On the negative side: The author's view in respect to Justification and sanctification is clearly corrupted by the very Christian theology that he demonstrates is wrong.In summary: This book is essential in that it demonstrates both the wrong and right understanding of end times prophecy; but detrimental in that it promotes the wrong understanding of salvation taught by most Christian theologians.
4,Israelology: The Missing Link in systematic Theology,the book is in excellent condition with handwritten appendices which are helpful rather than a disappointment. The glossy cover is still in tact and all round we are happy with the purchase. the only drawback was the length of time we waited for the book to arrive. thanks.
5,The Missing Link in Systematic Theology,"""ISRAELOLOGY"" This book has long been missing for Theology Courses. It explains Chapters 9 through 11 of the Book of Romans and so thoroughly. A must read for those who dig deeper into THE BOOK of ALL TIMES, FOR ALL TIMES, WHILE THERE IS ""TIME"" !"
5,Great toy !,"I loved this toy or i should say my grandchildren loved it ! I have a 2yr old grandaughter and a 4yr old grandson and my son's girlfriend has a 3yr old little boy and they all three loved it ! They loved throwing the beanbags to get points and they loved feeding the fish to get points ! I wish there had been even more bean bags included with the game because they were impatient about sharing the bean bags but they all three loved the game and it has an attached zipper bag to store the bean bags in and it rolls up so neatly, it doesn't take up any room, i wish i could say that about all of their toys ! They played with it outside and inside the house so it was a great game for them and i would recommend this game to anyone with toddlers and young children. They will love it !"
1,THIS HAS A SERIOUS BUG EMC REFUSES TO FIX-DO NOT BUY IT!!!,"I bought and installed this software several months ago. As I typed or dictated, the window would suddenly lose focus every 5 to 10 minutes and my typing or dictation would be lost until I noticed. It was frustrating. But then, when I used my computer to give a presentation to a client in PowerPoint, it lost focus and just hung. Every 5 minutes!! Using msconfig, I finally traced it to this #$*&(#$ software. I looked on their website and sure enough, they acknowledge the bug but have never fixed it. There is no solution and no work around. It appears they are focused on porting to the Mac to get more suckers. I uninstalled their software and will never buy anything from them again. I suggest you save yourself the pain I suffered through and find a different backup program."
4,Don't understand some of the reviews,"You can definately choose to backup more that just the entire hd. You can choose individual folders if you want. My friend uses it to just back up one huge folder that has all his business files.I must admit that I've never actually used it to restore anything yet so I can't testify how well it would do that, but it's been backing up my hd faithfully for over a year every Monday morning at 6am. Installation was a breeze. However, the documentation and user interface is poor. The explanations as to how the program works is also insufficient. I'd like to see more of a well written explanation as to what it's doing and how it works."
1,"makes backup, restore doesn't work for Vista","It came with the new iomega USB drive I recently bought. Installs fine, will backup selected files or the whole drive... WON'T restore my Windows Vista laptop to bootable condition...Just to test after it screwed up, did system restore disks, made a backup, tried to restore. Rendered the system unbootable missing partition table entry and many files... tried to ""repair"" with restore disks... ended up having to do full restore again to get the laptop back to usable condition."
1,Any Negative Stars Available?,"I give it a minus 10! Same problem as others -- ""not enough disk space available"" when I'm trying to back up 1 GB of data to my External Maxtor HD that says ""63.3 GB Free."" AND IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT - BOOO!"
4,EMC Retrospect,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. This software won several awards from respected computer magazines. For me, it installed easily when following the documentation and it seems to be backing up the files and directories I selected. It's been running on my PC since April, 2007.I just purchased and installed a network storage drive so I will be moving the backups to that drive."
4,Retrospect Express,Very easy to install. Seems to be doing my backups as scheduled. It is what I needed and everyone needs.
1,Stay away from this product,"I didn't have any troubles getting the license code entered..but my disappointment with this product comes when trying to actually use it.I tried backing up 90 GB to an external WD 500GB drive with 360GB free.. ""Not enough space on backup drive"" .... really informative. So I reduce the amount of data I'm backing up to see at what point it will work. It never does. I continually get ""Not enough space on backup drive"". So, the software obviously doesn't work the way it was advertised.On top of that, it's practically impossible to get technical support from this company. Emails to any support addresses I could fine went unanswered. Since I bought this software from Amazon, I'm not even sure I can return it.Find something else to spend your money on."
1,Thanks for the heads up.,"Having read 2 negative reviews about this product I decided to contact tech support to ask a couple pre-sales questions. Three EMC related phone numbers off the web got me three different companies. One did give me a support number but not one that supports this product. A call to a forth number made me realize that this is a product to stay away from. If the distributor you buy from can't provide support, you have to pay for support.joef"
1,Retrospect - stay away,"This is without doubt the worst experience I have ever had with software. I had been using Retrospect (older version) to back up, had a crash and attempted to recover files. First, the software will not install on the new laptop. Second, product support from manufacturer and distributor are a joke. There is more but why bother?STAY AWAY!"
1,"No matter what I do, I can't make it work!","This program came with a hard drive I purchased, and I thought, WOW, backup software. That is, until I tried to make it function. I never saw anything so user un-friendly. I spent probably 12 hours, and still can't get it to save a system restore and the documentation stinks.Why can't somebody come up with a reliable, easy to use back up program that works??????"
4,Despair and Hope in Rural New Brunswick,"This is a fine first effort by a new writer. It describes the life of Miriam, a woman from rural New Brunswick who survives poverty and other tragedies to create her own identity in the world, returning eventually to her rural roots.At times the character Miriam is simply maddening, and you want to grab her and throttle her, but this is tempered that the limited options forced upon her because of her sex and the regional poverty of the times, forces her into what might seem to us - in our far less restricted environment - as unreasonable. Ultimately, however, the story is one of personal triumph, and Miriam is, if not exactly a winner, definitely a strong survivor."
2,"Blah,blah,blah","After reading the first chapter of this book, I was pretty sure I knew how the victim died. She was talked to death. The Shape of Snakes the first mystery I've read, where absolutely nothing happens - except talk. and talk. and more talk. I only hope that Ms. Walters steers clear of the screenplay. The only thing more boring than a book with no characters in motion, is the movie version of that book. I would ask for my money back, but when I reached the last page ,I felt it was my duty to prevent another reader from making the same mistake I had. The book now rests on the bottom of the Long Island Sound."
1,Definitely her worst book yet,"I've kind of enjoyed Ms Walter's other books but I gave up on this one after a couple of chapters. I'm grateful I bought it from the library and didn't waste any money on it.The plot is quite unbelievable and boring - I found it impossible to believe that the heroine would be so obsessed with the death of a woman who is essentially the local baglady 20 years or so after it happens. I also found her liberal white condension towards Annie, the lady who dies, quite offensive. The major reason though was that after the first few pages I knew that a lot of cats would probably be killed quite horribly and I never read books where there is gratituous cruelty to animals. I simply put the book down and don't read any further - and in this case the story was so uninvolving it was easy to do."
3,Intelligent and Gripping--but a WARNING!,"Walters is an unusually good writer in the genre, she creates beleivable characters who stay with you, and her plotting is simply excellent. That said, a serious warning for cat lovers--there are pages and pages of grotesque, gratuitous cat torture in this book. It's essential to the plot, but the author's semi-pathological relish in detailing all the torture over and over makes this book impossible reading for anyone who truly cares about cats. (The author also unintentionally reveals her rather warped moral sensibilities by having the heroine happily put her teen age children in harm's way, and has both heroine and hero- husband use physical violence as evidence of their upstanding character. Very odd woman, this Walters. I would much rather read her than meet her.)"
2,Loved her other books but this is my least favorite.,"For some reason--maybe it's me--I just couldn't really get involved and caring about the characters and the plot unfoldment in this novel of Minette Walters. I started with THE BREAKER and found that to be intense, ""spot on"", and perfectly British as the sinister thriller progressed. THE ICE HOUSE was also great and I recommend either of those over this one.Other reviewers have done justice to the plot and offered a more positive reading. I'll just offer the analysis that a writing strength can cut both ways. Minette Walters' characters and plots are brilliantly detailed and complex. . .. but if I don't really care about or connect with the characters and/or the unsolved mystery then the density becomes dulling and I am largely unable to follow it with any enthusiatic attentiveness.And to chime in on one other controversy, I am neutral regarding the cruelty to cats here as well--it seemed to me to be a minimal and anecdotal part of the story"
5,I haven't cried over a book in 20 years -- until now.,"Recently I discovered Minette Walters. This is the third of her books I've read & I find it the most powerful so far.There are many things to like about her writing:1) the interspersing of faxes, emails, letters, pictures, newpaper articles, etc. add interest to the text2) her characters are complex -- no one is entirely bad or good3) the story she tells is compellingI don't want to take the pleasure away from a new reader by telling too much of the plot. Suffice it to say that I was completely moved by the story."
4,Different,"This is the first book by Minette Walters that I have read. It was a good book, because it has a good structure and an interesting build up until the end.It was interesting that the victim, Annie, had tourette's syndrome. Walters writes about Annie's struggles, as she deals with her problems. Sadly, Annie is badly treated by cruel people that live in her neighbourhood. Very few people try to help her, because they do not understand why she behaves as she does,and because they want to keep out of trouble. Annie also suffers because she is the only black person who lives in the neighbourhood.20 years later, one neighbour tries to find out what really happened to Annie the day she was murdered."
3,"Valuable, interesting information, well researched, but . .","Fans of Law and Order will find this book a valuable guide; the episode section of this book is great, listing the main stars, guest stars, crew, and production staff for each show.The narrative about the concept of the show -- how it came into being, who did what, etc. -- is lacking, however. The authors have chosen a thematic approach, short chapters on the main stars, guest stars, the executive producers, the theme song. The chapters are far too short. The interviews with cast are good, but the narrative holding it all together is kind of dull.You'll find some great revelations in this book, especially about how the cast members, past and present, think about each other, but really you'll flip past most of that stuff to get to the episode guide.The book is now sorely out of date, missing more than two seasons of new episodes. I suggest you wait for an update."
5,A colossal compendium,"I have a debt of gratitude to this book and its authors. It provides a great wealth of information regarding the episode, the characters, a background of the show and many interesting tidbits and trivia-like facts. I only hope that an updated version comes out soon. In short, anyone who loves L&O needs this book!"
3,When I'm Calling You: I have heard better collections,"A bit disappointing. This collection of 22 recordings by the great Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy features only four duets. The rest are all solos. ""Wanting You"" and ""Song of Love"" are missing, as well as other memorable duets. Two arias (Waltz Song from ""Romeo et Juliette"" and Toreador's Song from ""Carmen"") show Jeanette and Nelson could do a respectable job with opera. The sound is sometimes muddy, e.g., ""Vilja."" But the old favorites--""Indian Love Call,"" ""Will You Remember?"" ""Ah, Sweet Mystery,"" ""Rose Marie,"" and others--redeem the collection."
4,Formulaic but entertaining,"I'm usually not into anime like this. I prefer Ghost in the Shell or Cowboy Bebop. And even though there is a lot of juvenile humor all over this series, I still felt compelled to keep watching. Sure, it's formulaic; a young man discovers that he's secretly gifted at something he's never tried. And through constant trials, becomes everyone's hero.Except with motorized roller blades. Apparently, there's a legend about a roller-blader that... Anyway, the plot has been used before.What I liked about Air Gear was the characters. They each actually have some depth, and react to the situation with their own insecurities. That is, when they're not pooping in front of everyone.Air Gear is a light, fun series that kept me entertained. I do wish someone would pick up the project and finish it though. The show ends about half way through the story line."
4,"Scholarly, wonderful, and unreadable for the lay person","This edition is perfect for teachers, serious students, and advanced courses. It is fantastic and for the person who wants the best scholarship, this is the place to go. But it is not for the person who simply wants to enjoy the tale or for introductory courses. I would suggest using this book as a resource along with one of the more readable prose versions."
3,Acceptable,I use this heater in an enclosed section of my shop that is 7X20'. It takes longer than I would have expected to bring the temp up to 68/70 degrees. After the temp is up it does an acceptable job in maintaining the heat. I would buy a unit that has a stronger fan next time.
1,Poor quality - nice design,"Ordered two of these - shipped separately via Fedex. One would not even power up (missing the rear power button) and the other had scrambled LCD controls and locked out. Both had plastic fragments rattling inside, which fell out the bottom. Customer service promptly replaced them with two other units that actually functioned but still had plastic fragments coming out of one and a loud fan on the other. No indications of UL approval. I've been told I will get a full refund. Too bad, I really liked the design."
2,Don't Bother.,"The sound quality on these is poor, and you will find yourself immediately replacing them with something better - so don't waste your money. The center speaker sounds muddy and is not as good as the built-in speakers on my Toshiba TV - we don't even use the center speaker because it is so difficult to understand spoken dialog with it. After about a week I replaced it with a Polk (admittedly more expensive)."
3,just ok,Its cheap for 3 speakers and it comes with wires but it sounds just ok. I tried out these speakers thinking they would match with the sony mb 150 speakers. It turns out that they sound very different. They are not nearly as clear as the sony 150's that feature the kevlar yellow cones. I also finally realized that the grills are not removable. In case you are looking to match these with other sony's in quality of sound this is not what you are looking for. But if you wanted a cheap package you may be satisfied. I'm going to get the sony cn550 instead.
4,very good deal,I was very impressed with the sound I got with these very inexpensive speakers...Now my home theater system is complete and under budget yeah!
4,great,this is a fine album by some local artist. I am sorry that I left them on my wish list for so long
5,I loved it!,I was at a loss again for ideas on where to have my youngest son Andrew's birthday party. Using this book I found many great ideas and I didn't have to spend a fortune on the party. I recommend it highly to any parent who wants their child's birthday to be memorable.
5,Great Movie,"Terrific movie, obviously dated now, but very good acting, interesting plot, and terrific music theme. Wish this was available on DVD and/or the music score on CD. One of my favorite movies."
3,"Oh, that ending . . .","Set in Chicago, a group of characters, now in their thirties, examine their earlier lives for what might have been, but wasn't. It sails along pretty well until the end, which is a total disaster--utterly tacky and unreal. What a shame."
3,Nothing new - good summary of leading theoris,"This book is in my view a good compendium for introduction to organisational theories. The only new this book brings to the table is to structure the different theories into four frames: structural, HR, political and symbolic. I personally find this to be a good categorisation and I like the selection of theories (very mainstream), i.e. a good choice for use in business schools. Many of the classics are however left out.The critique of managers' and consultants' failure to solve organisational challenges is a bit misplaced in a book which offers little practical advice on implementation, i.e. this book is for the student."
1,the author make no sense,"This book will waste your time, the author use unnecessarily lengthy language to describe self, the author should more efficiently concentrate the main point !!!"
4,Some insightful studies of organizational structures.,"The text for Navy Post Graduate School Organizational Management class in Summer 97. Somewhat dated in areas such as the description of car production lines. The book lays the foundation for defining the types of modern organizational heirarchies, lightly identifing philosophies back through Max Weber and up to the latest fad for what have become disposable employees. Nordstroms, Volvo and other corporate environments are reviewed. Saturn carmaker seems to be the latest organization observed. The book could use a look at how information technology is putting a spin into the workplace and some of its new upstart organizations. Cable networks, chip manufacturers, Postal service/UPS, and the dramatic changes expected in the IRS look ripe for case studies. Nonetheless, I liked the book and found it an inspring read. Looking forward to more of these. Frank Steinbach"
4,Joining Together: Group Theory and Group Skills,Great service from Amazon and affiliate company.Book is excellent for anyone in leadership training as it provides insight into viewing the world from many perspectives and angles.
5,MPA,Is a book. I need it for class. Masters Public Admin. Its surprisingly light for the amount of pages as well.
2,Kindle edition needs edits,Interesting book but the kindle edition is formatted very poorly and there are strand dots between every letter. I emailed amazon only to be told that they know it's a problem but they don't know when they'll be able to fix it.
5,"Realistic, great book","This book is cites realistic examples of businesses and CEOs such as Home Depot. Although it was a requirement for class, I am so glad I read it. It really makes you look at leadership and organizational structure of businesses."
5,LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY FOR PARENTS AND KIDS ALIKE,"The author of this series cleverly tapped into ""stupid humor"" where you cannot miss the punch line. At one point reading this book, my daughter and I were laughing so hard we were brought to tears. The humor definitely bridges the age gap and allows my daughter and I to bond over laughter. A true delight!"
5,6 year old can't stop laughing,"My six year old son loves this book, and all of the Dumb Bunnies books for that matter. They are silly and he has had a great time reading them."
1,sick! sick! sick!,"Anyone that reads this book to their child should be ashamed of themselves. This book is the most disgusting thing I have ever read. This book is supposed to be for ages 4 - 8 years old. I raise my child to be a better person than these people that apparently think this is a book that is proper to be read to a 4-8 year old. My daughter brought this book home from her school library and asked me to read it to her. Since the book came from school I proceeded to begin to read it to her but stopped because I am not assanine enough to put discusting language like that in her mind. It is never o.k. to call anyone or anything dumb. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks so, but if that is true, then this world has become more sick than any of us thought. SICK! SICK! SICK! The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't find any way to give it none or negative. SICK! SICK! SICK!"
5,Perfect Gift,I bought this for my best friend and her boyfriend who are complete golf nuts. When they aren't working they are golfing and/or having a barbeque party for their friends. They are also a couple who have everything and are very hard to buy. I bought this for a Christmas gift for my bestfriends boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. In fact they want to buy one for their other golf buddy. A perfect unique kind of gift for those hard to buy people and I shipped it straight to their home. (I also bought the 7 piece golf barbeque set to go with this gift.)
5,Ian Fleming does it again!,"Fleming adds the detail and the smashing debonaire of oo7 together and comes up with the incredible novel: On Her Majestey's Secret Service. The high adventure, the beautiful Bond girls, and James Bond's ""save the day"" attitude make On Her Majestey's Secret Service a must read! I've written several books myself but none compare to this. I stayed up late until one in the morning reading the wonderful descriptions of the exploits of Bond, James Bond. It, along with Casino Royale, The man with the Golden Gun, Goldfinger, and You Only live Twice, are ranked high on my favorite novels list and should be yours. The head of SPECTRE and his Number Two man torment the spy but as always, Bond defeats the evil plans of Ernst Stravo Blofeld but for him to only fight another day!This book is so good it should come with popcorn!"
5,BOND- BETTER THAN EVER,"It' s simply my favorite book of all. It not only has a good plot, but also the characters are perfectly described. Not far from the legendary film (""OHMSS"")"
5,The Best Bond,"Easily the best book in the sensational series, Fleming here combines break-neck spy action, his flair for compelling descriptions, and a very human exploration of James Bond. Few spy novels have ever achieved this sort of grand synthesis. Thank God that the movie version was up to the challenge of adapting Fleming's best novel -- the film is almost as good the book, and retained the experimental and touching finale."
2,First Fleming novel cements him as hack,"First case I have ever come across in which the movie is better than the book, and the movie wasn't that good either. This was such a waste of my time...this isn't the James Bond I have come to know through the movies...this is a gestating pansie-boy, ready to come out of the closet. For God's sakes, James Bond's hands are sweating throughout the novel. Bond's hands aren't capable of sweating!"
4,A mixed bag.,"This particular selection was not the best choice for my first James Bond novel. I didn't realize until after I purchased it, that it was the second in a three book Bond series. If I had known that, I would have chosen something else. That being said, it was a pretty good read...slow in places, particularly in the beginning, but it picked up speed as it went along. I would also like to add that it did not end well, and that is somewhat of an understatement. I have to assume that the third book in the series has a better/happier ending. I may or may not read it to find out."
4,James Bond gets married,I haven't read Ian Fleming's James Bond novels for over forty years and yet when I read them again it is still a treat.
4,"Enjoyable, but not perfect","The beginning was a bit slow, too many French phrases and places so I had a hard time understanding what he was talking about sometimes. Kind of like not getting an inside joke but knowing the context. I would have preferred a different ending, but it is what is."
3,"Five stars for David Tennant, zero for Ian Fleming","Urg. Not even for David Tennant's lovely voice and acting excellence will I sit through this load of antiquated misogynistic boring drivel. I understand this was hot stuff in its day, but geez, the prose is just painful to endure - flat, banal, tonedeaf stuff. I got through disk 2 and bagged it. I'll stick to the movies -- they're so much better written, and they've got scenery. The set proves that even a brilliant narrator cannot save a bad book.All that said, it's a nicely done set in a nice package, so if this is your thing, you won't be disappointed in the quality presentation."
4,Spy Ski,"This is my first ever James Bond novel, I can't remember if I saw the movie. This is a thinking person's spy story with few gimmicks but great finesse and ingenuity. Fleming fascinated millions with his suave 007 personality and his missions against villains who were larger than life and twice as nasty.The pace is slow, a good armchair read with a briar pipe in hand. An entire new generation will find the foreshadowing deep and miss the absence of the now classic action adventure. But Fleming's astute writing style will continue to attack new fans who enjoy a good story well told.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,"Not his best work, but worth the read","I enjoyed reading this for the story line, but it didn't read as fluently as his other works. This may be because it is an earlier work, or I wondered if it is a poorly translated version."
3,Not Bulgakov's Best,"I'm a huge Russian literature fan and absolutely loved reading Bulgakov's Master and Margarita and Heart of a Dog, unfortunately this work didn't live up to my expectations. The story line is ok but while Heart of a Dog and M&M still feel relevant and fresh, The Fatal Eggs reads out of touch and old-fashioned. First of all the characters were much less compelling than in other Bulgakov novels and as for the story it is amusing but perhaps the satire is too time specific to translate well. It is a short read so if you want to complete your Bulgakov collection you can do so easily."
4,KOOKY COMEDY IS A LOT OF FUN,I saw this film as a kid at the drive-in with my parents and I've always remembered it fondly. Day and Keith are so natural in this movie and they have a definite movie star quality about them! Pretty funny family friendly comedy. The DVD transfer is very good.
5,Fun Family Entertainment,"No sleaze, no crude words (hell and damn pop up), no naked bodies, no smarter-than-my-parents children, no sexual innuendoes, no veiled political diatribes. A pleasant comedic look at what the kids REALLY think when ""Your mom married my Dad!?!?"". One of my favorite Doris Day movies because it's family centric. Worth a spot in the collection."
4,With 6 you get Egg Roll,"A movie for any age. Many real life experiences are used to create Comedy Classic. All Fun and Clean. Amazing how comedy of the past was funny without todays use of uncolorful, colorful Metafores. Nice to see the long since gone actors as well."
5,Doris Day/Brian Keith Collector,Enjoyed this Doris DAy movie. received in timely fashion in excellent shape. Will purchase from your co. again!!!
5,With Six You Get Eggroll,I received this product very quickly and it arrived in perfect condition. I couln't be happier.
4,Doris still makes us laugh,"Doris Day shows here that she can make anyone laugh whether it is through a fight, a courtroom scene, handling the office, and trying to control her youngest sons. Everyone else also adds to the story. This movie is a great nostaglia amd pure fun."
4,Its wire,"Its wire, and it works. I used it to rewire my motorcycle. I'm not sure what else you can write in a review about wire."
3,Fairly cute,"My son has recently became interested in meerkats/prairie dogs...so we got him some stuffed animal versions. He had a mother and baby meerkat and requested a ""daddy prairie dog."" I got this one and he seems to like it. It looks a little gangly and disheveled compared to the others we've gotten him. Overall, not bad but I'd consider getting a different one in hindsight."
1,Ludicrous,"I like Bertice Small and I like fantasy romances. So, I thought this would be great. Sadly, this was neither good romance nor good fantasy. I gave up after the first 100 pages or so. Writing was simplistic and did not engage the reader at all. And as one reviewer said, not even good love scenes."
4,Lara - Book one World of Hetar series,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it as a good read. I had a hard time putting it down.
4,I LOVE BERTRICE SMALL BUT...,"I ADORE BERTRICE SMALL'S WORK. I HAVE READ EACH AND EVERY BOOK SHE HAS WRITTEN, EVEN THE ANTHOLOGIES. THAT SAID, LARA IS NOT ON PAR WITH ADORA, WHICH I CONSIDER HER BEST BOOK. I LIKED THE PREMISE (MAYBE LARA COULD HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY A ""BAD"" PLEASURE HOUSE THAT BURNS DOWN ON THE NIGHT HER FIRST RIGHTS ARE TAKEN..SHE IS SO DISORIENTED FROM THE FIRE THAT SHE ESCAPES INTO THE FOREST..)BUT THE REPETITON REALLY GOT TO ME. THE CHARACTERS ARE GOOD, THE SETTING IS GREAT.. BUT ENOUGH OF THE BACKSTORY. OTHER THAN THAT FLAW THE BOOK IS QUICK PACED AND A JOY TO READ."
1,"Lara, Book One","I have always been a fan of Bertrice Small. The first in line to purchase anything she publishes without even reading the jacket. This book was a huge disappointment. While I appreciate her trying something new in creating a ficticious world, it is in no way up to her usual standards. I found the characters simplistic and unbelievable. The same explantions are given over and over (how she came to be sold and her mother deserting her). It was like she was just trying to fill up a page.I still love the author and wait anxiously for her next book (I have read all of them). I hope it will be better thought out, and not just a book that looks like it was thrown together to fulfill her contract."
1,"Fantasy and Romance Lovers, Run Away!!!","Those of you looking for romance (hot and sexy or sweet and heartwarming) or rousing fantasy adventures are looking in the wrong place if you're on this page. Run in the oppsite direction, now! This tripe opens with an ""as you know, Bob""-style infodump unworthy of the most incompetent fantasy, in a world that might or might not engaging in better hands--I can't care enough to tell. By the time I gave up (around page 60), there was still no sign of Lara's male romantic lead, and barely any sign of Lara herself--even when she shows up, she doesn't exhibit much personality. If she doesn't care about being sold into sexual slavery, why should I care about her? I did page ahead, looking for a sign of her romantic lead, but I never did see him.I'd give this book zero or negative stars if I could. It's not even in the ballpark of a romance, and it fails pretty horribly at fantasy, too. I say this as a devoted reader of both genres, as a warning to others: run away!"
1,"Boring, slow, poorly written","The pace of this book makes drying paint look exciting. And even with power skimming I had to stop half way thru, I realized I just didn't care about the charaters at all. I didn't care what happened. The heroine is a cardboard person, poorly drawn. In no way believable, yawn. THe world is boring and predicable, honestly with so many great books to read why waste your time on this one?"
2,What a disappointment,"I would never have guessed this was a Bertrice Small novel. The Kadin, the Sky O'Malley saga, and others contained strong powerful heroines and strong stories. This heroine was just lame. And the men...all they wanted to do was 'mount' her -- and they did, a lot. Why was the author compelled to spend so much time describing debasing sex scenes when the heroine even said it was debasing... many, many times too!?!? It wasn't until I was 3/4 through the book when there was finally a ""make love"" type of scene. And the number of times the heroine recounted her life's story to everyone she met was growing old, quick! I can't begin to explan how unappealing the story was and then to add the sex (not intimacy) it was a waste of Ms. Small's talent.I read once that Ms. Small's doesn't deviate from her standard story concept, even in Fantasy. I agree with that. The addition of Faerie magic, sorcery, etc., doesnt anchor this book. It just lacks a story much less a strong lead character."
5,Agartha,"I read this book when it first came out, I was totally inspired to put the words into practice, and guess what, it works. This book took me into a very real world of plant deva's, non local relationships, and gentle, lovely true advice. I've bought many copies for friends, all of whom enjoyed it as much as I did. I loved following the authors experience of growth as she first, as a novice meditator, meets her guide ""Mentor"", and later shows the wisdom she herself has gained from the whole experience of channeling. I just loved this book. Thanks"
5,Read this one to augment any spiritual beliefs you have.,"This book practically fell into my possession with nothing short of providing the truths of our reality, you can even read this book as a good novel taking or leaving any info provided, it's all good..."
5,"Tonight on Cop Drama, they are going to say.......$#!+","Season 5 had many infamous episodes like when Kenny dies (and stays dead for a whole season), saying **** 162 times, Osama Bin Laden is similar to Elmer Fudd, Kenny having a Brown eye (on his face), Cripple Fight, Super Best Friends, when Cartman chopped up Scott Tenorman's parents and use their flesh as chili, and when the boys find out about sex. good stuff."
5,MORE MORE MORE!!!!!,"I've already taped all the episodes on T.V. from the seasons 5 and up. South Park is one of the most outragiously funny shows on air. I highly recommend this season and the rest. You won't be dissapointed. Matt and Trey bring humor, education and just plain raw comedy with South Park.Don't be the only one who isn't with the program.Episodes:501 It Hits the Fan502 Cripple Fight503 The Super Best Friends504 Scott Tenorman Must Die505 Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow506 Cartmanland507 Proper Condom Use508 Towelie509 Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants510 How to Eat With Your Butt511 The Entity (a.k.a. The Ginger Device)512 Here Comes the Neighborhood513 Kenny Dies514 Butters' Very Own Episode"
5,awesome show and awesome price,South park is still ground-breaking even after all of these yrs. And this season on jus goes to prove that it's a must have for those people who understand freedom of voice/choice.
5,Very funny as usual!,"I had seen only a few of the episodes in season five before i bought it. So when i watched the whole 5th season, i was laughing so hard. It is one of the best seasons. I still watch it after watching each episode more than 5 times each and they are so funny. Every south park season is good but this is one of the best.This dvd has very good graphics and i highly recommend it to any one who wants to watch something funny, or any one who is a south park fan like me. So if you are not sure if u want to get it, get it, it is worth it."
3,"great, but why are some language still ""bleeped"" on these?","Listen, ANYONE that buys SOUTH PARK on disc is buying it to own these gems COMPLETELY UNCENSORED, the way they are made. Yes, there are certain words that are not ""bleeped"" (as they are when broadcast on TV) but there are also ""dirtier words"" that are bleeped on these releases. I have to say that despite how much i love these shows, i buy and collect them to own them COMPLETELY UNCENSORED and this is not what they are. The bleeps must be put in by comedy central and NOT by trey parker & matt stone. Why is this necessary? Somebody make some inquiries..."
3,It's not the best season but has it's moments,I don't think this is the best season of south park particularly the first episode of the season but it does have moments. I think the best episode of the season is Butters. I say still go ahead and get it but I do believe the other four seasons are better than season 5.
3,"I really want to like this, but...","In the past, South Park was delightfully offensive. The jokes were fresh, the scenarios were slightly shocking, but most of all it all was delivered without feeling so deliberate.Season five? Well ... it's different. The jokes appear to come from from a new found sense of self awareness. That could be the straw breaking this camels back. Trying hard is one thing, provided it isn't obvious. Being over the top is fine, as long as people don't realize the top has been conquered.Season five? I mean, Cartman cooking the parents of his nemesis in Chile? Please. Cartman was a funny bigot with a mean streak, but nothing so stupid as this. I can only hope Matt and Trey come through in season six with the magic that made the first five seasons so great. I'd hate to think I spent 40 more bucks on a three star box set."
1,South Park Season 5 review,"The season stinks. The stories get dumber every season. I mean a stoned walking & talking towel made by the government,a couple with real butts for faces,a kid killing a bully's parents to make them into chili and then making the bully eat it just becuase he cheated him out of some money? They also make fun Osama Bin Laden just months after 9/11. You make me sick. The only episode I do like is Kenny Dies because it teaches us we should take life for granted but even that is ruined by a dumb,sick ending. Overall,Buy for Kenny Dies and nothing else. I give this pack a 1 out of 10."
1,"I wasted my time, don't waste yours","This is easily the worse movie I have seen all year. I had really high hopes, I like Jason and Jessica a lot, but even they couldn't save the absolute boring, pitiful plot. If I want to see behavior like this I can easily go to any nightclub and it would be more interesting. Sorry, didn't like it."
3,"Not a perfect film, but still a well executed one","I first saw this on-line, by rental, and I really liked it. The characters feel real, flawed, and possibly unlikeable. You can't just tell someone ""don't see this move,"" when it desperately depends on the person. Yes, there is sexual explicit dialogue and detailed converations of experiences the characters have had but it has the realism of actual conversations; Yes, the amount of drugs they ingest would make it astronomically impossible for them to still have coherent conversations, but that is the only bold flaw in the film. I love these kind of films--real life situations--""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset,"" which are brilliant films.In closing, this has flaws but overall makes up for them in the end."
3,well..,"The story sucks. No excuses. But, the ideas offered in the movie are great. It seems, they had a bunch of good ideas to put in a movie. But, no story. So, combine the two and you get London."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This movie was just awful. Just a lot of screaming, yelling and very bad acting. What a waste of time and money for everyone involved (including the viewers)."
1,Steroetypical rich ignorant teenage film.,"I was highly disapooint in such a stupid film like this. All it was, was just sex, drugs, and too much use of the f word. None of it was necessary. The movie was all about a idiot trying to get his girlfriend back before she leaves New York. Whoever written the script must only have one vocabulary and it's the f word. I couldn't stand how much each character in the movies said the f word over and over again, especially Chris Evans. The part about the cocaine was also dumb and you have immature rich teens snorting coke just to be cool. There is no plot to the film and it doesn't deliver any messages or anything. I mean, my message is expand the your vocabulary, don't use coke, get mental help, so that no will become as stupid as the idiots in this film."
2,I don't know,"I really don't know about this one. I mean, it was an alright movie, but still was really whiny and spent entirely too much time in the bathroom.Way too much Tarentino dialogue, with dumb lines that ended up with ""man"" or ""what the f--- dude"". Pretty over the top and lame. There was stuff that made no sense in the movie also.Stathom's character says he's impotent ,but yet he goes home with a hot chick, talking about havin sex. Whatever. I like Statham alot, but he's in some suck movies lately. Check it out , but don't expect much. It gets 2 stars because it wasn't waaaay bad ,just bad."
4,The Dark Side of Love,"Everyone has troubles, and the next guy's might just be worse than yours. This movie takes a long hard look at that in a contemporary fashion, showing that your really do need to tell someone how you feel before it's too late."
2,London,"Jason Statham is very good in a very different role for him. Jessica Biel is HOT, but she's not really a big player in this movie. Her character is important, but doesn't get as much screen time as one would expect. Chris Evans was just as mediocre as ever, he might as well have been the Human Torch from Fantastic Four. Movie itself has a great story, just very week execution."
4,An under-appreciated movie,I took a chance on this movie one night and was very pleasantly surprised. To be honest I'm not sure why it has gotten such bad reviews both on here and with critics. I felt that it was successful on a number of levels and you don't have to be a drug addict to enjoy it. I was engaged the entire time and felt for the characters. Chris Evans performance was very strong and I hope he does more movies like this. No need to mention how great Jessica Biel is. Sure the plot line is thin and not a whole lot really even happens but the acting is strong and it is certainly entertaining.
2,Not the classic I knew as a child,I watched this with my 8 1/2 year old daughter because she did not know the full story of Peter and the Wolf. I MISTAKENLY decided to share this version with her!!!! It is very artistic although somewhat disturbing for a young child. No dialogue at all.
3,Not for Children!!,"I made the mistake of screening this for my kids one night via Netflix. The animation is fantastic, but the film is beyond dark. At one point, Peter's nemesis, the Wolf, swallows his pet Goose (yes the cute looking fellow you see Peter holding in the cover image) in a fairly graphic manner, which completely traumatized my children. Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,NOT FOR SCHOOL,I am elem. music teacher. I've seen them all- stick with the Disney version. This is not appropriate for school- too scary.
2,Purchased as Christmas Gift,"I hoped to make it as a gift to teach a youngster about instruments of the orchestra. Very little emphasis is placed on instruments and their role in character development. The story line is revisionist from the original. Hunters are militaristic, mean and ineffective. The duck is a meal for the wolf and never rescued. The wolf is not shot by the hunters, but rescued and placed in a game preserve. I found it to be an overall disappointment!"
1,misguided,"This is such a deviation from Prokofiev's original that I cannot recommend it at all. The original intent of this work is to get kids to apprecitate orchestral music. This version does not introduce Prokofiev's music until 10 minutes into the feature and during this time Peter accidentally bumps into one of the hunters while walking the street and the hunter proceeds to toss Peter into a trash dumpster and point a gun at his head. For the love of .... ; is anything sacred... as a music teacher, apart from the animation ...this is just rubbish and I can only imagine Prokofiev rolling over in his grave!"
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this short version of Peter and THe Wolf. I thought it was scary for children and didn't offer any introduction to instruments the original animated movie did which I have been unable to find. I actually would like to return it.
2,Very dark,"I bought it for Christmas and family movie time, but OMG it was dark and creepy. This is not the version I remembered from childhood. I may look again. My son has been to Ukraine and said it looked very similar. But otherwise, a bust."
4,Peter and the Wolf,I found this version would be better for older children. I will use it to concentrate more on the music
2,Peter and the Wolf,I felt like the story line was compromised by not have any narraration to explain the storyline which is highlighted by the use of the musical instruments. I was very disappointed. The older versions are better.
5,Brilliant!,"This Peter follows closely to Prokofiev's music - but, if you expect some narrator to carry you along, you'll find yourself all alone. The story emerges by itself, wordlessly, and does so in the most beautiful way. The Cat comes through with all the feline smugness you could hope for. The Hunter - well there's a whole new tension that I think Prokofiev never had in mind. If you grew up on the vapidized versions I did, this comes across with a harsh edge, resolved eventually in Peter's favor.But, for me, this is all about the animation. As much as I love CGI, it has yet to capture the extra level of human involvement and craft that inheres in puppet animation. This isn't the ""happy ever after"" story the disneyfied version wants you to expect. Instead, it has kids dealing with harsh realities - the way they do in the real world, like it or not.Good music, good animation, and it doesn't talk down to the viewer. Doesn't talk at all, really, but that's part of the appeal.-- wiredweird"
4,Must be introduced,"It's an artistic and intelligent presentation of Peter and the wolf. I am fond of it, My grand-children, 8,8 and 6 who where fed from age zero with Walt Disney and Japanese comics where surprised, and not really pleased. But now they adore it when their mother tells the story. I think the best way to give the little ones a resl pleasure is to first tell them the full story before watching the DVD.Lily. Granma, 73 years old"
1,Creepy Puppets!,Saw the movie a couple days ago on Netflix. The puppets were really creepy looking. I would not buy this video for young children. The puppets were really ugly and uninteresting to watch. Also my kid didn't stay longer than 2 minutes to watch. I just fast forward most of the movie to see what was happening. Definitely don't understand how this won an academy award. I did not enjoy it at all! Would not recommend.
1,too much artistic license,"Considering this is a Russian tale, the artist took too much artistic license for the setting and characters for my liking. I had to use many other materials to introduce ""Peter and the Wolf"" before I ever got to showing this video."
1,Big disappointment!!,"Boy, what a disappointing DVD. I had hoped they would follow the story but they decided to change it into a dark and dreay tale."
5,great entertainment,"My granddaughter and I enjoy these movies.. we dance and sing the songs, it is an enjoyment to see her happy with these great videos"
3,"Good graphics, but violent","I liked the graphics and the music; however, the scene where the duck is eaten by the wolf is very graphic for little children and the bullying/violence shown I dont consider appropiate for classroom use. Other than that is ok."
5,One elementary music teacher's review,"This version of ""Peter"" is the best I've ever seen. The purpose behind teaching ""Peter"" in an elementary music setting is to introduce theme and variation as well as the instruments of the orchestra. I've always been so frustrated by the versions of this which have a narrator. Who needs a narrator when you already have a visual for students to watch? The narrators always take away from students' ability to listen to the music. In this version, no narrator exists leaving the story to the music and the beautiful stop motion animation. My students are better able to focus on the music (the themes and instruments) and vocally duplicate them after I use this DVD to enhance my unit plan on ""Peter and the Wolf."" It makes me want to hug the director. -K. Adams"
3,"Alert - this version has no ""Extras"" (Commentary track. , etc.)","Amazon has a separate listing for the DVD with extras (as of today, it's only $2 more). I'm ordering that now -- it was my mistake for ordering the first one I saw and not reading carefully.Beware, too, that this re-worked story line is darker than the original. I suggest you watch it before sharing it with young kids. I agree with the comments a few other have made about the initial encounter with the hunter -- it seemed unnecessary, as does Grandfather locking Peter in the yard.The music's excellent, if not exactly what Prokofiev wrote, and performed beautifully."
5,A Return to the Great Safety Razor Shave!,"Stop for a minute and consider how much you spend on those awful cartridge razors that give you an inferior shave. If you're like me I got two shaves most out of those cartridges, which added up to about $50 a month on razors! With Gem Blu Star, I can get about a week out of just one blade, so the Gem definitely wins on cost. Also, if you've never had a shave with a safety razor, you don't know what you're missing--it provides a great, smooth shave. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a pack or two, your face and your wallet will thank you! FYI, the seller is very prompt with shipping."
5,Entertaining and easy reading,"I am a lomg-time B5 fan, who purchased and retaina all video versions and spin offs, which I dust off and re-watch ever other year or so.This is My first printed story by independent authors following outlines by B5 creator, J. Straczynski. I liked the book and in my opinion it was credible, well-written, entertaining, and followed the B5 story line well. I thank the author, Peter David, for his effort in writing the Final Reckoning - The Fate of Bester. I have no negative comments about the book or the author, and I hope he will write more B5 stories. I will probably buy all the B5 paperbacks eventually."
4,Deeper into the story,This is a good book for Babylon 5 fans. It dives deeper into the problems that led to the destruction of Centari Prime(the second time) and the eventual liberation of the Centari. Well writen and fast paced. But noy as good as the Techno mage trilogy
5,It seems that a good story can't be kept down,"The second book in the trilogy about Centauri Prime takes the first book and carries the story in an interesting direction. It is truly terrible and wonderful to see the change and growth of many characters from B5. This book spends alot of time on Vir, who is going through some serious changes. This story takes place just after the series has ended. I read this book non-stop as it was a REAL page turner. If you like Babylon 5, this is for you!"
2,Unsuccessful transition for Vir Cotto character,The story gains more action in this second volume but also gets some major holes in the plot.The main failing is that the transition of Vir Cotto from bumbling comic relief to revolutionary hero is done poorly. It should have been done more gradually.
2,I guess I'm the only one....,"I guess I am the only one who found this book to be a bit of a let down. There are just so many plot holes (not only between this book and the show, but between this book and the last book!). As I read it, I just kept thinking....""there are so many things he COULD be talking about....why is he wasting my time on this!"" I guess I just dont jive with this author. I found the Bester books to be a completely believable addition to the B5 universe....as I read this....I just kept thinking.....""Did JMS not even read this before it came out?"" I dont know. I know he did the outline. But. Im disappointed. It felt like this guy manybe watched the show through once...and took a few notes. But thats about it. Oh well. Cant win them all. Maybe the Technomage books will be better. yeah. Ill give him that tho....he captured Galen pretty well."
1,oh- come on now!,"The only reason that it took two days to read this book was because of how short and transparent it was. Yes, it was a very easy book to read, but it was an insult to all intellegent people out there. If you want to by a book for your child than this is it because no adult would find any joy in reading this boring book"
4,"Great, but would've been much better in HD.","This was completely unbelievable in that I could easily imagine myself watching news in the future. However, the poor quality of the video was somewhat detrimental to that illusion. Onion should've released it in HD. That said, at $2 it's a steal and I highly recommend you buy it."
5,Ms.,The Wenol product is very efficient in cleaning alluminum. We are pleased with this product. I would highly recommend for use on alluminum products. We used this on alluminum wheels on a truck and it really shinned them.
2,Not as asvertized.,"This productr was advertized as safe for car finish. However, it is not and is only for metal areas like wheels, etc."
3,Cute and harmless French phrases,"Many French slang books go too far for most classrooms. As advertised, this one is suitable for the younger crowd, who will love the illustrations. It is cute, but leaves out the risqué expressions so common in the majority of French slang books. I have an old copy of this edition, but if you are buying today, be aware that the newer edition comes with a CD."
3,THEY sent me the Wrong Order,I ordered for an angel sculpture....I recieved really fast. I opened the packaging and the box said angel mold but when I opened it I found a Swan mold. I returned the item and wrote the seller a letter about my order. Seller apologized. I bought the same thing from the same seller and hopefully I willl get my order right this time.***** WILL UPDATE REVIEW once I recieved my new order****
4,datashark,Works great for average Joe. May want something a little more durable if your in the business or use daily but for occasional use works great.
5,Works Great,"I used this tool set for making RG6-Quad cable when finishing my basement. The tool set worked great, way better than the crimper style. The ends were secure and I tuged on the cable pretty hard. I would suggest this set to anyone who wants to make well made cables. This tool is very easy to use."
1,Can't get to work,"Hi, I bought this kit at Home Depot. I am not a professional...but I know how to strip cables, do odd jobs around the house etc.The stripper worked just ok....the blade moves around a bit not very sharp.Anyway stripped cable according to instructions but couldn't get connector to join to cable. Kept falling off.Tried about 5 times...restripping....compressing...no luck.I thought I must be missing something so went back to Home Depot..guy there pulled out a replacement.He tried...same problem.I don't know...either both of us are wrong...or kit is no good.I suspect that the kit didn't like my cable....but surely it should work with any RG6?I wouldn't recommend this kit unless you do this for a living."
4,Got the Job Done,"Product performs as described. This is my first attempt at terminating coax cables and everything was successful so I'm giving it a four. Not a five because I had to use a (don't know what its called) handle thing that screws into the terminal and lets you really leverage the end onto the cable. They're dirt-cheap but I would say absolutely necessary. I used it on RJ6 quad-shield cable.No complaints about the functionality of the tools themselves. Did the job well. My cable company wanted 40 bucks to come out and terminate two ends. F that, for ten bucks more I can buy the tools myself.I really can't imagine trying to get the fitting on the cable without the additional tool. The directions use the word ""firmly"". I nearly had a stroke trying to do it by hand. Buy this set then go down to your hardware store and buy the two dollar handle thingy."
4,Good kit for the right size cable,This is a good kit as long as you are working with just the newer RG6 cable it's designed for. The older RG5 cable fits in it but the caps will not hold since there's no crimping. But if all you have is RG6 then get this kit. It's easy to use and doesn't take a lot of strength to accomplish.
4,Cable compression tool kit for regular guys,I bought this set because I was tired of using twist on cable ends bought at Wal Mart. This makes for a much cleaner and professional install. The unit is 1st rate other than the stripper which works but feels a little cheesy. Can't complain for the money. A good overall unit for the average or occasional cable installer.
2,Didn't work for my quad shield cables - price is misleading,"I purchased this kit based on the reviews - but I would suggest spending the extra money and buying better tools and connectors. The connectors in this kit did not work with the quad shield cable I own, plus the stripper is unlike any other I've seen, it does *not* strip both sections in one pass as other tools do, making the user guestimate the proper length (1/4"") for each section - annoying.Also, the instructions fail to mention that you must remove the outer layer of foil and fold back the two layers of braiding for quad cables. I suggest spending more money on connectors and tools, e.g. I've had good luck with Digicon. You won't regret it."
5,Works great,"Perfect for around the house. Easy to use and 10 connectors is enough unless you have a big job. Even then, it's easy to buy more (plus you might mess up your first one or two until you get used to it)."
1,Can't get the connector on impact acoustics RG-6 Quad Coax,"I have tried everything and can not force the prepped coax all the way up into the connector so that white insulation on the center wire is flush with the back wall of the compartment. The problem seems to be that due to the thickness of the layers of shielding and the black outer insulation on the rg-6 quad cable I am trying to use (impact acoustincs) will not fit into the small collar on these connectors. I would need another tool just to get the connectors seated all the way on the coax. Something that would grip the coax close to the connector and then would jam the connector and the coax together. Once this was accomplished, then this crimper could be used to secure it on the cable. Without this, I am going to have to buy a different product that works with ALL rg-6 quad cable."
2,Broke after a few uses,"After about a dozen compression fittings, the pin for the center hinge broke on the compression tool. It was a cheap metal alloy. The tool worked pretty good up until that point. I can't say I will buy another datashark product."
2,Works ok,Bought as a back up set to keep in the basement.cutter is not as great as my other set.go to one depot or lowes and get a better Set for this price.
5,Excellent Ferret Litter Treatment,"Nature's Miracle is great for nearly completely eliminating odor from my ferret's litter box. This one of very few products that can be safely used for ferrets. Both the large chain pet stores no longer carry it, so I was thrilled to find it via Amazon."
3,"Is this film's aim to show barbarity of Africans, or what?",I am very confused after watching this documentary. And appalled of course by the violence and atrocities committed. But I'm left with a strange feeling. And I wonder: what is the motivation for perpetrating those atrocities? (what's in the mind of the men committing them). And what is the motivation of those producing the documentary: what is the message in the documentary?? that Africans are barbaric? I feel quite uncomfortable after watching this I must say.
1,Pro-RUF Garbage,"This is basically one long, inaccurate apologia for the Revolutionary United Front -- a group that abducted children to fight as child soldiers and whose surviving leaders were convicted of war crimes in 2007. The RUF committed widespread atrocities, including the amputation of limbs of tens of thousands of civilians. This film, however, bizarrely focuses on the United Nations, UK, and Nigeria -- all of whom intervened at different stages to stop the atrocities -- as the main aggressors in Sierra Leone."
2,Easy way to flip the egg,The pan is the perfect size for cooking one egg. Like many of the other reviews on here have mentioned the handle is hot and will burn your hand. Also it is nearly impossible to flip the egg in this with any type of spatula. My solution is to pick up the pan w/ a mitt and flip the egg into another pan.This pan creates more work than it solves
4,It works..,"Although somewhat of a novelty item, it does produce perfectly round shaped fried eggs. I have had the best results by spraying it with oil and when I want to flip the egg, I loosen the edges with a spatula, slide it out of the pan and on to the spatula then flip it back into the pan."
