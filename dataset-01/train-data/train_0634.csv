3,Not to shabby,I bought this product for my mom and after a little exploring and playing around I finally got it to do what I wanted. The picture quality was ok but I expected a little better. The transitions from computer to the piture frame are very fast and exporting pictures from other files was accomplished after some trial and errors were done. Overall I think it's a little overpriced for what you get but my mom loves it so that's all that matters. I would definately recomend this to someone who has a digital camera.
4,Interesting Reading,"Fairly comprehensive. I felt that more information regarding the current value of some of these sleds would have been helpful, though."
4,Very nice book,If you are intresting in finding out more on the history of old wooden sleds you will find this is the book for you to read!
1,I already reviewed this title....and it is still appallingly bad,"I submitted a review of this title on Amazon two years ago -- only to revisit my page and find that the corresponding review is NOT attached to Baran's ""Feet First"".Therefore, I am writing a new review -- with the same message:THIS BOOK IS HORRID.Baran's tone? Hectoring. Arrogant. Reeking of delusional omnipotence.His style? Hopelessly confusing. Chapters are arranged illogically.His text is fraught with grammar and spelling errors.Do not be mislead by the other reviewers who found this memoir delightful.It was not. And yes, Mr. Baran: MOST Polish-Americans enjoy polka music, even ""Who Stole The Kiska""."
1,"Terrible, Simply Terrible","Avoid! Do not buy this software. You have been warned. I WAS a long time user of TaxCut but this year the interface is awful, the program is super buggy, Did not come with all of the forms, downloading forms are a nightmare, program crashed and closed on a regular basis, there are no interviews for the business forms, can't seem to figure out how to use the program, had to select a different type of business to get program updated, program is nothing like previous years.In short I feel ripped off. I don't know if the other versions are like this, but the business is. Maybe I need another version for a complete Business/Personal experience. I have no idea and the program does not seem to help.To be honest with you I would rather do my taxes by hand than to use this program."
1,NOT The Same TaxCut,"Don't get this product confused with previous years' ""Home and Business"" offerings. Call it what you want, but to me this was a deceptive move to boost revenue. The previous years included all the forms, interviews and software necessary to do both home and business. Not to mention, at the same price! To acheive the same results, now you must purchase two separate products, Business AND Premium, both of which are not cheap. Just a bad move IMO. I've been using this product since 2000 and this just may sway my next purchase.Customer support is horrible. There's no other way to describe it. Long hold times (both phone and online chat). Add to that, representatives who do not understand the product features and offerings. It makes it very difficult to work through simple issues. Be prepared for the ""check the FAQ"" line."
3,Not very friendly,"Not very friendly as the TaxCut deluxe. H&R need to work abit harder on this program. if you do not know your way doing your corporate return, don't try it just pay for a pro and finish with it."
1,Not for Individual Income Taxes,"I purchased this product thinking it would allow me to do an Individual with a Schedule C income tax return. Imagine my surprise when I saw that this product did not have any 1040s or Schedule C's included. It is my mistake for not reading the fine print cloesely. However, I give some of the blame to Turbo Tax for not conspicuously displaying the fact that the software is ONLY for corporations and nonprofits. This sofware was useless to me as an Sole Proprietorship."
3,Newcomer's Handbook Seattle,The book was pretty informative listing what one could find in different neighborhoods of Seattle.
1,Suck!,"As the title implies, suck. That is how I would review this product. Broke down after a year of very minor use.Onkyo can eat it."
5,"Another new author for me,","""The Coffin Trail"" is a believable mystery. The characters are realistic. An unsolved murder in an idyllic setting is a change from the crime-ridden cities of many of my favorites. This is not a fast-paced adventure, but still a compelling read. I intend to read more from Martin Edwards."
2,Only okay.,"Daniel Kind and his lover, Miranda, buy a house in the Lake Country; a house once lived in by a boy accused of murder, who was found dead of an accident. Daniel's policeman father investigated the case, but Daniel never believed the boy was guilty. Now Daniel is asking questions and causes the police to take a new look at the murder. The locals are not happy, particularly when someone else dies.The basic story, the descriptions of the Lake District and the overall writing were enjoyable. But this was offset by lack of character development, being irritated by the relationships of the two main couples, and the coincidences. The scene exposing the killer just wasn't realistic. I found myself having trouble caring about the story or the characters. It wasn't a terrible read, but there are many better out there."
4,Well written mystery,"I enjoyed this book - the writing style was good, the plot and characters are believable. Recommended for those who enjoy British mystery writers such as Elizabeth George, Ruth Rendall and PD James."
1,Set in the Lake district,"but really slow, poor character development, and hard to keep track of the characters and plot. I like British mysteries but this is too dry"
3,Good characters & surprise twist,Although I had figured out who I hadn't figured out the why so I enjoyed that surprising twist. I liked how he built the characters. They were interesting. The only problem was the last chapter ruined the entire book for me. Why did he have to do that? That last chapter was stupid. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for that chapter. Very disappointing. I won't read any more of his books.
4,A huge international hit!,"This is a re-issue of Elvis' 1961 number 1 hit single, ""Surrender"". It includes the original B-side, ""Lonely Man"", which also hit the top 40 in the US, peaking at 32. The single would eventually be certified PLATINUM by the RIAA. An alternate version of ""Lonely Man"" is included as a bonus. This is a nice collector's item for avid Elvis fans."
1,Right angle adapter is not working,"Right angle adapter is not working, its hard stuck and wont budge when used and caused the drill to overheat, the wire brush included frayed right away and flung allover the place scattering the wire bristles, easily overheats when used for 25minutes onwards, i think this is meant only for quick jobs only, you really get what you paid for. specially for a tool made in China where quality is sacrificed for profit."
3,The picture of the product is incorrect,"The picture of the product clearly shows genuine APC logo, which made me buy the item. However, the actual product is not by APC, but it is a compatible product.Although the compatible product works good, it lacks the paid return lable which comes with genuine APC battery. Now I have to pay for the shipping charge to the company designated recycling center."
1,I'll go with APC next time!,"I have six or more APC UPS units that take RBC4 batteries. For the first time ever, I decided to save some funds and purchase an ABC brand instead of APC brand (this was about three weeks ago). First thing that I noticed was that the ABC brand battery BARELY fit into the UPS unit. Even though it was sold as an exact replacement, it is about 1/16 of an inch larger. I had to smash the door closed to get it in. Yesterday, it gave a ""needs replacing"" beep. Don't know the final outcome of this, I shouldn't be hearing that beep for about three years.I just ordered another battery last week for another UPS. This time, I ordered the actual APC brand. I suspect that I will not have similar troubles this time!"
4,Good gift,He enjoyed this book as the gift it was used for and had it read by New Year's. No problems.
5,An unforgettable read,"The best of an era fought in a terrible war, and too many were lost. Gerald was an incredible man who was born to be a leader of men, a fighter. If it had not been for the war his accomplishments may not have been as great.The story was riveting and well told. The author did meticulous research and produced a book both realistic and exciting."
2,Has anyone seen his BArbie doll?,"You won't believe this but this is about a search for a grown man's stolen Barbie, or,okay, Blondie, Doll.Weird.And boring."
4,Just what I needed,Thanks! the book came on time and in good shape. Should be a help in my studies for the NCT Exam.
5,"The more I listen to them, the more I like them.","After a little period of adjustment, these arrangements 'grow on you', because they are so very well performed. Bach, a great arranger himself, would have smiled a lot listening to what's been done with his stuff."
1,awful paperback,"The cover is rough with many spots on it.The inside is also rough ,tooIt is really a used book which has been used for many years.I don't understand how such an old book can charge for such an high price!"
5,UNREAL!!!!!,"This is so rad. I can't believe I'm the first to review this super scintillating read. This book is a real page-turner. And the authors? There's no comparison. They're obviously at the top of their field. Ok, ok, so they taught me everything I know and I owe all the success in my personal life to them...but who cares about bias anyway? I'd buy it, but currently don't have that kind of money in my wallet. But don't worry, I swear it's the first thing on my christmas list. (and I promise not to nail it to my wall)"
4,Intriguing Cinnamon-Flavored Natural Mouthwash,"Tom's of Maine makes good natural alternatives for many common household necessities and is notable particularly for the full line of dentifrices and mouthwash products they sell. Their ""Cinnamint"" mouthwash is presented as a natural alcohol and saccharine-free competitor to name brand products.The mouthwash tastes fine, though has a bit of an aromatic ""camphor"" tinge in my experience, but is nonetheless quite refreshing. I like this product, and would buy it again. The only reason that I generally continue to purchase more common alcohol-based products is because of the more understood anti-gingivitis properties in some other dental rinses and mouthwash products like Listerine.If you are seeking an alcohol-free mouthwash, Tom's of Maine delivers a winner with their ""Cinnamint"" flavor. Of the alternative mouthwashes I have tried, this rates among my favorites."
1,Fiction is stranger than Truth???,"I couldn't finish this book due to the fantastic exploits and their believability. He's not shy about how heroic he was that's for sure. This guy puts Audie Murphy to shame. He is a bombardier turned pilot, gets shot down, joins the resistance and kills numerous enemy soldiers while fighting off the amourous advances of the french ladies then steals a german bomber and flies to freedom.INCREDIBLE....too incredible to be true. I searched for other references to his exploits and/or his existence in France at the time, even including the 8th Air Force site. Nothing. Zip. The only fact that is verifiable is that he did exist and was in the 8th."
3,The book was better,"This is a disappointing treatment of the Cadfael mystery St. Peter's Fair. Those familiar with the relationship between Hugh Beringar and Cadfael will find the hostility between the two in the movie version most incongruent. Moreover, the lack of romantic tension between the heroine (Emma) and the villain compromises the climax. In the book, the villain remains courtly and attentive, while in the movie he is forward and boorish. The ending is the most disappointing of all. In the book, the villain, truly ruthless and without principle save for his own interests, meets a firey fitting end at the hands of Emma. In the movie, he dies for his partisan principles in a much more pedestrian way - one more soldier killed in a civil war. Thankfully, Derek Jacobi is perfect as Cadfael. He gives his character depth, humor, and charm. He gives the show a presence it would be lacking otherwise."
3,Yikes!!!! What happened?,I enjoyed the ending of the book- I didn't enjoy the ending of the movie-Cadfael (though well acted) does not have to be the hero ALL the time!I also missed the real Hugh and his wife-Read the book!
2,Not good for Windows 7,"Several years ago I wrote a very positive review of this printer--with Windows XP it is a real workhorse, but it is not good with my new HP Windows 7 computer: you can only use the PCL driver, the PostScript driver offered for Windows 7 will not install (""Operation could not be completed [error 0x800f0214]""). And printing a graphic PDF with the PCL driver is agonizingly slow! HP is not the company it used to be!"
1,"WOW, What a piece of garbage","I've used HP products for years and have never seen such a poorly made printer from them. It is made of very cheap plastic including the hinges. You better be a delicate person to use this.So, I unpackaged the printer, installed the toner and setup up the printer in no time. I tried to add paper but had to move the plastic pieces to acomodate letter size and it wouldn't move. By the time it did (brute force)it felt like it broke but seemed ok. Next I ran a test rpint and had ghosting and black all over the pages, even after 30 pages. I ran the clean utility built in and that made it worse. So, I decide to pull the toner and look at it and a spring flies off into the guts of the printer. NICE!! The toner is now shot and won't go back in and there is no way I will purchase another and waste the money.What a waste, do not buy!!!"
2,Great Printer - Between Repairs,"This printer prints with great sped, high quality, and without jams. It is on a network for XP and Vista users and I never get complaints except when it stops working.I first bought this printer in July 2008. It worked for 6 months and then the Formatter board (the circuit board that drives the printer's logic) failed. I sent to to HP and they repaired it. It worked for about 6 months and the Formatter board failed again. This time, HP exchanged the unit.I purchased an extended warranty from HP and I am happy I did because the Formatter board has now failed on the exchanged unit.The formatter board on this printer must have design and/or manufacturing problems. I have had HP laser printers for over 20 years and have never had a problem. This model has been a glaring exception. If you do buy this unit I recommend you also budget for an HP extended warranty"
1,Extremely unreliable!!!,My company had 4 of HP LJ3005DN. All of them died in 4-8 months. Main issue - motherboard and RAM failures. Never will come back to HP.
5,"Great, fast service!!","The Jay, Jay DVD we ordered shipped much quicker than expected! It arrived within 4-5 days much to our surprise and the delight of our daughter. The product was in very good condition just as described by the seller. We would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again."
5,Incident at Oglala-The Leonard Peltier Story,A well researched and well written story of yet another case of American justice gone berserk. It's worth the time of everyone of us to see this film.
4,Very Good Documentary,"This is an excellent documentary of the events on the Pine Ridge Reservation that led to the imprisonment of Leonard Peltier. It does sn excellent job of showing the incident from the side ofPeltier and the other Native Americans. It could have done more interviewing with the government authorities who were there. The truth can be seen through the government's lies as shown in books such as ""The Trial of Leonard Peltier"" by Jim Messerschmidt, ""Agents of Repression: The FBI's Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement"" by Ward Churchill, and ""In the Spirit of Crazy Horse"" by Peter Matthiessen. Those three and Leonard Peltier's book ""My Life Is My Sundance"" are all very highly reccomended for anyone interested in this subject."
5,"""A RIVITING DOCUMENTARY!""","I remember seeing the stand-off in the news as a teenager. I remember thinking that the government was using ""over-kill"" to bring the ""civil disobedience"" to an end. I have recommended this film to friends who want to learn what really took place. It has a nightmarish effect as you watch events unfold. That this tragedy took place in America crystalizes the judicial systems pathos. What is right and what is legal no longer meet. The ""light"" at the end of this tunnel is that the spirit of the idea these Indians were visioning has in some degrees held on! Bravo!"
4,Thoughtful documentary about an under-explored topic,"Solid, interesting, if slightly dry documentary about a shootout on a Sioux reservation that killed two FBI agents andthe government's attempt to railroad someone for the crimes, finally succeeding with Leonard Peltier, using a lot ofclearly falsified evidence.Just as interesting as the trial itself is the examination of the split between the `modern', more assimilatedNative Americans, who worked hand in hand with the US government, verus the American Indian Movement (AIM)who were fighting to protect Native American heritage, leading to a reign of terror by the modern Native Americantribe leader.There is one key element, the mysterious `Mister X' who supposedly confessed to the killingsthat's awkwardly and strangely under-explored.In all, this feels like a good episode of PBS's great `Frontline' series, which is actually pretty high praise."
5,Incident at Oglala,Excellent documentary on this travesty of justice that continues unchecked today. Facts are confirmed. I will view this film again and again.
5,Incident at Oglala- The Leonard Peltier Story,"I stil to this day have not recieved a copy of this video, therefore I for warn people to check for product information and who you buy from. Although I did retain a copy on my own I loved this documentary the copy I managed to attain will stay with me forever."
4,Incident at Oglala,Just what I was looking for. The storyline is riveting and heart rending. Robert Redford did a fantastic job as he usually does.
1,All Lies,"This video only shows what AIM wants everyone to see, did they get any of the FBI for this video, NO, did they tell you how they killed their own people too, NO did they tell you how they threatened and stole from the people, NO. I do not advise anyone to purchase this comedy video."
2,Thank Goodness for Fast Forward -,"Very disappointing - most of the material was boring, often pandering to various politically-correct topics. The one bright spot - Tina Fey's parody of a hypothesized Sarah Palin channel."
5,Softwalk Birch are #1,"I own three pairs of Softwalk Birch clogs and they have become so very hard to find. I cannot even find a size 9.5 in black Birch clog.The shoe is so very comfortable and when I wear out a pair I order one more. I wear the shoe down to nothing and even tried to get the shoe repair to fix one that one just done. Well, I hope Softwalk reads these reviews so they can produce alot more."
2,metal church metal church metal church,"They have that one song that you just love...""metal church"". Somehow everything else just gets a little boring. The concert would have been more entertaining if they sacrificed an animal or something."
4,Useful for travel,"I love the idea of using this for travel with all the restrictions on liquids. It works great, and my only tiny complaint is that it's kind of hard to lather with. It still gets the job done, so I'll jet away with it."
5,Powerful,"This movie is excellent. Being from just outside of d.c., even then i didnt realize the opression that my brothers and sisters are pelted with in that little city. His poetry speaks the future. Keep lookin for Saul Williams, a book is out. Check out lyricist lounge for a recording. Good stuff."
3,Great movie of two characters you wouldnt think could pull it off together,"I bought Surviivors due to being a big fan of Robin Williams... the story seems, like some comedies, a bit out of touch, but the directors pulls it together nicely creating a charming film to enjoy with friends and family.Matthau and Williams create a great duo in this classic film that leaves you convinced that it was a match made in heaven, when most, like myself couldnt see the two acheive the charisma that was protrayed. Great film that is highly recommended which can be enjoyed for years to come."
3,A Pleasant Diversion,"Walter Matthau and Robin Williams team up in an accidental joining of miseries. Enter Jerry Reed, who enters their life as a hit-man who himself has bottomed out. Reed's cadence is a remarkable riposte to Williams' slow maniacal meltdown, and Walter Matthau adds the spice of wisdom and grace to make the film spark. Enough comedy to keep the movie moving forward, especially the scene in the telephone booth where Williams invites Reed the killer to a ""mano a mano"" showdown. Very 80's, very funny."
4,Entertaining & Funny,"This is a very entertaining, comical film with two outstanding performers. It gets a little bogged down and silly towards the end, but still recommended. It contains some strong cussing at times so would not recommend for small children and appeal might be geared towards a more mature (older) audience."
5,A must see movie,One of the funniest movies ever. It had been years since I'd seen this movie. Laughed just as hard watching it this time as I did the first time I saw it.
4,messed up,Although I used to always check the format but haven't been lately therefore I ordered this with the incorrect format. In the USA you always want to get the NTSC and not the PAL. I did it anyway and it is almost not worth packing it up for such a cheap price. I write this just to warn others like myself who sometimes forget to verify the format before they buy. I probably purchased about 30 before it happened during this purchase. Am I bad.
2,keep looking,$180 for a whopping inch and a half?there are way thincker and way better deals than this
2,Was looking for a mattress not a topper.,"Was searching for a memory foam mattress, and the link said this was a 10"" memory foam mattress, but when I got the box, I saw that it was only a topper.The topper came all compressed and it has yet to expand to the full size.Would not recommend this product at all!"
5,Great Read!,"I enjoyed learning about the daily lives of the Vikings and also the adventure of Eric the Red and his son, Leif. I would recommend this as read aloud for any family who wants to learn more about Vikings and enjoys adventure or for a child at about the 5th grade reading level. This coordinated beautifully with The Mystery of History Volume 2 lessons about the Vikings."
3,Way too tough for a fourth grader,This book would probably be more for a fifth or sixth grader. Very long and complex for a 10-year old. The book was interesting but too wordy to hold his interest all the way through.
3,Note on the extra movements,"The two movements described as Variation 1 and 2 are from the Concerto in F, HWV 331, thought to be the ""New Concerto for French Horns"" announced for performance at the Drury Lane Theatre on March 20, 1723, five years after WATER MUSIC's debut in 1717. Studies of the paper on which the music is written confirms a date later than 1717. Gardiner has also included both movements in his recording of WATER MUSIC and Raymond Leppard has recorded the Concerto in F in a selection of concerti for Philips (reissued on MHS) - I prefer both of those performances to this. Both movements show Handel's skill at making something new of familiar material."
2,"This cd is ok, but not usually good.","Pimpalation is I'm sorry to say it's a dissappointment from pimp c, now I Enjoy pimp c's style and image and his work from UGK, But this cd is totally over the top and real predictable, although this cd does have a few good moments, but the rest is just useless and staleThe Album does have some image, but what is the rest of the album trying to say?Thumbs Down."
4,A Notch Below Sweet James Jones Stories,like I said in the title of my review this album is a notch below sweet james jones stories. The reason was that it is a notch below it is because a couple of the tracks like that one with ali & gipp were sorry. Too much of them and not enough Pimp C.
4,Good alternative to APC brand,This is my second ABC (American Battery Co) replacement battery (the first one was a RBC2 replacement). Both batteries have worked without any problems. ABC seems to be a good alternative to the more expensive APC brand. Give it a try.
3,Aftermarket - NOT APC battery,"Although the picture is of an APC battery, this replacement is manufactured by another company, ABC (American Battery Company).I do not appreciate being misled. Had I ralized that this was an after-market battery, I would have expected it to have been much less expensive than the name brand.No free recycling of the old battery was included, either.However, the battery does seem to function adequately."
1,Worst online shopping experience ever!!!,"Purchased what was supposed to be an American Battery Co Product through Wonder Electronics. When the item arrived, would not hold a charge, and I was unable to reach anyone at Wonder Electronics, I contacted American Battery Co. They verified that, based on the identifying numbers on the battery, it was a fake!!!! I tried to return it to Wonder Electronics, but they have refused to either take it back or refund my money. I'm pretty sure selling counterfeit products is a CRIME!! Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money & buy from the manufacturer or a reputable distributor. Wonder Electronics was a nightmare to deal with...I'm now out the money & have a worthless, phony product to show for it!"
3,Good for young starters,The paper used for the painting is not as sturdy as I hoped. But it's a good starter project for young children learning to paint and stay in the lines.
5,VERY NICE,"I bought this for my five year old grandson. It was easy enough for him to do yet enough of a challenge to make it fun, too. The colors were brilliant. I highly recommend it."
3,Not so great,"The price is good, however the paints were terrible. My daughter used the pages and colored with crayons using the paint colors as a guide."
5,"Great book: easy reading, easy understanding of serbo-croate","I don't speak anything in serbo-croate language and this book is the best and more complete publication that I found to learn this language and to know everything about it. I'm still studing and the book is pleasure to read. It would be better if would come with the audio cassete, but the explanation about the pronunciation is very interesting."
1,"Caution, imam probleme s knjigom","I am a student of the serbian croation language in which we use your book as our 'grammer' guide. i am taught by natives of the language, some of them doctors of the languge, at the greatest language school in the world....and i have to say that this book is not enuff to fully study the language and become functional. if you would like to dance around the language and tip tap around with few examples and minimal explanation, thus ensuring your typical average collegiate non-function-ablity after 4 years of education, than this books for you. it offers good explanation on the case system, however combines dative and locative into one like the russsian language system...an odd feat, however commonly done. i suggest use of this book w/a collection of others you can find."
1,serbo croatian language DOESNT exist as such!,there is NO such thing as SERBO CROATIAN language! these two are separate languages and should not be mixed.unfortunately there are too many people who are not aware of this fact and ignore it.so please take it into consideration before you buy this artificial language dictionary!
2,needs a serious revision,"Yes, indeed, this must have been one of the best books on Croatian and Serbian languages in the 70s and 80s, but not any more. The author needs to be aware of more recent changes in the two languages, and include them in the new edition. He needs to include examples from current literature (newspapers, etc), and keep his beliefs on politics and linguistics to himself. Only the Serbs and Croats can decide how they will speak and write. The author should actually write two books: An Introduction to Serbian Language and An Introduction to Croatian Language; he is a good writer and he is capable of achieving this quite easily."
4,An very complete book!,"This book is full of information, and is for those who seriously want to speak the language of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro. It addresses grammatical, vocabulary, and alphbetical differences of the two main dialectical variations - Eastern and Western (though I wish they would refrain from using the labels ""Croatian"" and ""Serbian"").The book covers vocabulary and expains the language in detail. It includes an extensive glossary and a number of essays for reading practice. It goes way beyond the basic tourist phrases.Though it can be a bit dry and doesn't take the snappy, fun approach of some other language instruction books, it is very useful, clear, and compete. A rarity for books on this language."
5,Good read,It was a good straight forward quick read that makes you think.Helps you better understand why people turn to civil Disobedience.
5,A fascinating well written history of South Africa pre-1870,"This book is incredibly useful to any examination of the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. Its examination of the Xhosa cattle killing is especially well done, and as a whole the book is readable, challenging, and useful for research."
2,Very Disappointing!,"The first 3 out of 5 guitars I searched for were not listed. Missing certain models of Kay, Dean, Silvertone to mention a few. When I looked for a model of Martin, that model was missing also. I found all of the models in a different price guide. And yes, all of the missing models are vintage."
2,Don't Rely on This Guide for Pricing,This is an interesting guide to browse but I would not rely on this guide for pricing. My experience is that the suggested prices are often as much as 50% off the actual fair market prices.
4,Fun for a young family,"This is a favorite for our 5 year old & an easy fast game to play with the family. My 7 year old doesn't love it as much, so the age rating may be a bit high. It's an easy game to set up, learn to play & have fun with. While there's a bit of strategy, winning is mainly based on luck. We had to add our own rules to the existing rules as they seem to be incomplete, but that just adds to the fun."
3,"Great pet toy, but needs some reinforcement","My sister originally gave me one of these for my cat. My cat LOVED it, and she's not much of a toy-afficionado. She leaps all over it, dive bombs shadows on the far side from the tent opening, sits in it when she wants to be cozy, and occasionally rolls the tent end-over-end while she's inside it. It's great fun.The initial tent lasted awhile, but one of the tent poles eventually cut a hole in the parachute fabric, and was exposed dangerously. So I got this one as a replacement, as far as I can tell the exact same item. This one lasted exactly thirty seconds before my little cat exposed one of its tent poles, the exact same way. My recommendation - if you buy this, take a moment immediately upon receipt to reinforce the fabric at the base of the tent poles - if you have a frisky puppy or a dive-bombing cat, you'll be glad you did."
1,If you like fast and confusing with a lot of stopping.,I like a hard work out but the moves were so fast and confusing I felt I did not get a good work out at all. She starts fast with a lot of confusing moves and then stops every minute to talk and give high fives. If you like a stop and go work out over and over and are very coordinated it may be for you.
5,Subtle and Beautiful,"Andrew Miller has created a unique and beautiful novel about characters who are caught in regret and the human struggle. The interweaving story lines are subtle and beautiful, and will be meaningful to readers who wish to look beyond the obvious and see the interconnections of our existence. One of the profound themes of Oxygen calls to mind a phrase from American poet jani johe webster, who wrote so eloquently: ""hoping not to leave/ this earth/ regretting."" And so the main characters of the book, estranged brothers Larry and Alec, their dying mother Alice, and, in a different country, a talented but anguished playwright, experience this very struggle: the struggle to live in a way that will liberate them from their wounds and regrets. Andrew Miller took on a great challenge in creating a novel that exists outside the box, and the outcome is a beautiful and nuanced literary work."
2,"I just didn't care to ""get it.""","Let me preface by saying this was my first Andrew Miller novel. Based on the description and the reviews I'd read on Amazon, I was looking forward to an exhilarating reading experience. Well, I didn't get it. You probably know the threads of the story: several, unrelated plot lines where each character is challenged. If I cared to, I could discern the links between them all; however, I just did not care enough about the story or the characters to pull the threads together. All through the story, I felt that Miller was just on the edge of taking the plunge to explore these characters more fully, but it never happened. Some characters were well drawn, such as Laszlo and even Larry, but the others were not fully realized. Since the novel had ""Finalist for the Booker Prize"" emblazoned on its label, I expected more."
3,...at least it was cheap.,"Got tired of having to hold the batteries in (after quite a few years) so I went on amazon and got this. Showed up on time, the right color, all tabs fully working, snapped right in, then got a PSVita for my birthday making this irrelevant...at least it was cheap."
4,gba,Cover fits great but wound up being the wrong color from the picture. It turned out to be dark purple when i needed and the pic showed the clear. Other than that it is fine
2,'Made in Taiwan' reproduction,"The one that I received was a Taiwanese reproduction and the color did not match the original shell. Still, it fit nicely on the console."
3,Darn close,"The color is off from what it seems like, I guess it was a lighting thing. The fit does the job but seems a little off. Still worth it if needed though."
5,A book with a bang!!!,I have scrutinized this book read and studied it. Very conscise for anyone who has no clue??? From past to present this book gives an excellent overview about Iceland and its many wonders including its volcanos and geysers. Colorfully illustrated all the way through. If you like short and to the point this book covers all travelling essentials(brief language tips per example)must buy for the wayward traveller backpackers included.
4,Stunning pictures!,"There are some truly beautiful pictures in this book.I certainly enjoyed Iceland during the winter, but thesepictures make it clear that summer is a real awesome timethere. The book also seems to do a pretty darn good job ofdescribing the society/culture of modern iceland.I would certainly carry this one with me on my returntrip..."
1,Neoliberalism vs Democracy,"Neoliberalism was born on September 11, 1973, when a US-backed military coup murdered the democratically elected President of Chile and ushered in the tyranny of General Pinochet who murdered and tortured thousands, closed parliament, and outlawed political parties and trade unions. If that doesn't give you pause about the compatibility of neoliberalism and democracy, read this book.In Hayek's model of an ideal constitution each citizen is given one vote per lifetime when they reach the age of 45 (page 113). Then, Hayek decides that's probably too generous, and calls for an ""indirect method of election"" where the legislature would appoint regional delegates who would appoint new legislators, without any popular vote at all (page 114).Neoliberals hate democracy, in both theory and practice, and are much more comfortable with an oligarchy."
2,Not so much!,"Im not a big fan of this workout! Im surprised because I have about 11 Crunch workouts & I love them all except this one. shes not very motivating & its not that fun. There are so many crunch workouts to choose from that target the same areas and are so fun. If you want to target these areas go for ""Bikini Body"" or ""Fat Burning Blast"" those do the same thing and are soooo fun."
5,Good Workout.,"I can feel the burn after this workout. I consider myself pretty athletic, and it challenges me. It's pretty fun too. I recommend it."
4,Hard workout for beginners!,"I tried this video today for the first time. I'm basically a beginner at workouts like these. Even though I'm young (21years old) it was a tough workout. I had to stop half way through but I am overweight but I can tell that this workout will work because I can really feel it in my legs, I know I'm going to be sore tomorrow. I would consider it an intermediate to an advanced workout. I'll just have to gradually work my way up!"
3,Too perky,I am particular about my instructors. This girl is too perky for me but the workout is very good. If I could only stand to get past the perkiness I would keep this workout because it really does work you out.
3,Fun Work Out,"This is a good work out that combines toning and cardio. I much prefer work outs that focus more on cardio, but the toning sections weren't too difficult or painful after my body got used to it. It was actually kind of fun. The only thing I hated was all the hootin' and hollerin' as one other reviewer called it. It was so distracting at times I found it annoying. Without all that nonsense, the DVD would have been that much better."
4,Good but needs more cardio,I liked this dvd but it left me wanting more. I wish it had more heart pumping cardio instead of cardio that wears me out because my legs are not strong enough to do repetitive squats and lunges. Anything other than just that. But I guess that is what it is gear towards so that's all you get.
3,not for begginers,"very fast paced and kind of hard to follow. it did come fast and it was exactly what it was supposed to be, i guess i just didnt imagine it would be so had to follow."
4,It's good,"This W/O is not too hard, Not too easy. Just right for people starting out. I like the trainer, although she's much too nice on her students."
4,Probably could have been more to it.,"I like the dvd, it's working out very well I can already tell my core has tightened and my [...] is looking fabulous. The lunges can be a bit tedious, but once you do the dvd once or twice you've got the moves down perfect. I feel like there should have been more exercises that went along with crunches, but it's all very effective. Also, I think the stretching you do at the end of the dvd is the best part. It makes you feel everything all over."
4,SK Socket Set,Excellent quality as expected from SK. Easy and assured purchasing process. All items arrived as stated and expected. Would shop this way again.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"After reading the reviews for the TEAC GF-350, I was concerned about buying the TEAC GF-650. No need to worry though. The magnetic cartridge makes the recording quality superior and there's no problem with the bass. Plus, the process is very simple with very easy to understand directions. I recommend the product highly to anyone wanting to convert their LPs or 45s to CD."
1,Toy is a bust,This toy is not worth the money. Years ago; there was a talking Spongebob that said many more phrases than this one and was much bigger. If you're looking for a toy with educational value; I would not recommend this one. I was very disappointed in this product once I received it.
3,Disappointed,Although the package arrived without a hitch; I was disappointed with the limited (2) the number of phrases this product had to offer. For the price; I would have expected at least 5 sentences. I was attempting to replace a talking SpongeBob that was purchased over 10 years ago.If your child loves SpongeBob; he/she will enjoy this but knowing that I have another version much bigger and says more; this product was very disappointing to me.
5,Late Night Truck Stop - Little Feat Bootleg,"I have listened to this CD, and it certainly deserves its 5 star rating. However, it is a BOOTLEG, and the band members are not making a penny from it. Paul Barrere of Little Feat is urging everyone not to buy it. (...)"
1,Little Feat Late Night Truck Stop,As stated before this is not an official Little Feat release.Please do not buy this cd. Little Feat is not receiving any compensation from this cd.Join the Tree and get it free.HW
2,A dubious pedigree,"The ""label"" putting out this copy of a bootleg (aka Snakes On Everything or just ""Live At Ebbetts Field, 7.19.73, Denver, CO, both shows"", but without all the tracks from both shows in this case), claims to have a release from Warner Brothers. But Warner Brothers has not represented Little Feat for many years. Little Feat considered legal action and putting out their own version on their new Tomato Lady records, but after listening to the tracks, considered the quality not up to their standards and a legal challenge not worth it.I have a fairly good copy of these shows recieved in trade a few years back; it's fair quality. I believe the source is from an FM broadcast. And many of the songs do not appear on other live recording in circulation - Hamburger Midnight, Texas Rose Cafe, Snakes On Everything and Cat Fever."
2,1973 live sets shows 2nd Feat line-up still working on it...,"This bootleg release is important mostly for historical reasons. It was recorded very early in the history of the 2nd Feat line up wherein Paul Barrere and Kenny Gradney joined the band. The sound quality and level of performance varies wildly on this 2 CD set. The material is taken mostly from the first 2 studio albums with a smattering of tracks from Dixie Chicken which are well-performed. When I compare this to the Feat I saw live 3-4 years later they hardly seem like the same band. Rough, but interesting to hardcore fans."
1,Why is this thinly-disguised bootleg still on Amazon?,"I love Little Feat and all of their live recordings. Which is why I am telling you don't buy this [junk]. Instead, run, don't walk, to buy the newly reissued and expanded Waiting for Columbus (2 CD set with tons of outtakes of excellent, five-star quality), then get Live from Neon Park (excellent live recording from current lineup)then get Hoy Hoy (lotsa live and studio rarities), then if you must, get Expanded Editions (decent live stuff from current band, a bargain). THEN, join the HOY HOY list at [their website] and start trading live recordings expressly authorized by the band. There are amazing live recordings out there, including the very show stolen for this CD, which admittedly is a fine show."
2,Exceedling Lame,"Being a major fan of two other Little Feat recordings, was expecting something similar from this. Wrong! Horrible sound quality, bad mix, sounds like it was recorded in a bathtub. If you like Little Feat and want a live recording, go for Goodbye Columbus, or Live from Neon Park."
2,"Helmet is as advertised, but it looks too small",I have this helmet next to a Riddell Proline helmet and it looks totally out of proportion (too small) to the other helmet. If you are going to display multiple helmets in your collection look carefully at the description before your purchase
1,Horrible fan mount,"This mount was said to be super easy to do, this took me about 4 hours to assemble. The rubber parts don't fit the metal mount and there is no way to get the rubber pieces in. I had no doubt that this product would work but I thought wrong. Horrible set up and design !do not buy!"
4,"Broad canvas, succinctly rendered","Steve Hermanos' ""Strange Jazz"" is a marvel of compressed storytelling. His tale of three brothers from Kansas and their winding path to a shared destiny the Lower East Side of New York City is a constantly surprising, yet satisfyingly inevitable tale of how shared tragedy can engender both the closeness of the idealized family and the alienation of the guiltlessly betrayed.Amid ""Strange Jazz's"" panorama of the astonishing breadth of experience available in just a sliver of Manhattan is the age-old answer as to why the likes of Jack, Benjie and Archie keep finding themselves there: It's the only place in America where freedom isn't just a concept, with all the emotional and physical danger that true freedom implies. The novel is a fine and often lyrical grappling with the central dilemma of existence while maintaining a narrative drive that rivals the best thrillers.Plus, parts of it are really funny. I can't recommend it enough."
2,"Sorry, Penn - too dark for my taste","Here's the story - I like Penn and Teller. I like Penn Jillette in general, even his old columns in PC Computing magazine. I think he's a bright and funny guy.And I'll grant that this book is pretty well written. It has a quirky style, but that's not a real drawback.But I can't say I enjoyed the book. It's dark. And I mean much darker than a typical Sam Spade type mystery. Depiction of what bodies feel like when they're fetched from the river, for example... yeah, it fit the story, but it's just darker than I want to read.It's not like anything else I can think of, but I suppose the best common ground I can come up with is Dean Koontz. I don't like reading him either, for the same reason. So if you like Dean, this might be right down your alley.With Jillette's background, you might be looking at this as a potential comedy buy. But if you're looking for comedy, look somewhere else, unless you like your comedy dark indeed."
2,"Great idea, but just too mean for me","I love Penn Jillette, and thought that the premise of a sock monkey narrating a murder mystery would be my cup of tea. Well, no. It's a great idea, but halfway through, I still didn't care about Dickie, or the Little Fool, or anyone. And, the descriptions of how to fish out a body or facts about acronyms vs initials were interesting, but almost didn't fit; as if they were thrown in because they were just hella neat. It's interesting, but too dark and mean. That being said, I'll still read whatever Penn Jillette writes because he's a very smart, very talented guy."
3,"I love Penn, but....","Don't get me wrong...Penn is GREAT. I love his show, B.S., and I went to Las Vegas specifically to see their show at the RIO.This book is smart and entertaining, it just seems to miss something. Is seems a LITTLE too preachy in places. And I know Penn loves to preach...and I mostly like to hear it. At some point in this book it just got to be too much..."
5,JAY JAY THE JET PLANE - SUPERSONIC PALS,"My 4 yr loves this dvd, its fun and educational. She has learned the songs and ask to watch Jay Jay and his pals over and over again. Great Product - Kathy"
1,Don't waste your money,"If you purchase a Bocce set, it will surely come with instruction on how to play the game. Use those and don't waste your $14 dollars on this collection of photos of the author and his Bocce cronies."
4,truly a sport for everyone,"Reading ""A Sport for Everyone"" brought back memories of warm Sunday afternoons at my grandparents. After a big family dinner, both adults and kids would go out to the back yard to play Bocce, Just enough exercise to help digest. I haven't played in years, so when we built a vacation house, I ordered this book in hopes of putting in a Bocce court of my own. The chapter on building courts was very helpful and clear. The rest of the book deals with equipment and rules, all very useful and upbeat. I'm now the proud owener of both the book and a truly fine court. This is a book written with the enthusiasm of a Bocce zealot. Even though the pulication is technically a bit primative,I hope it converts others over to a great ""social"" sport."
5,I think this is the best CD ever,This Cd has a lot of good songs that are great and I would like to comment it on saying that is one of the best the Invasores had ever made
4,Que me quedo,I wish I knew what the this song was called: I a mi que me quedo de tu maldito amor solo un costal de desilusiones mutilaste mis pasiones... Does anybody know what it is called?
5,I love this album. Still goes strong.,"This is by far one of my favorite Invasores de Nuevo Leon album. To me there are to eras.... one with Lalo Mora and this later group with Isaias Lucero, and then followed with another guy with a similar style. I guess it's three, right? Anyway, one of my favorites."
5,The Best CD Ever!,"Hello everyone! I really do recommed this CD to everyone out there. It's the best ever. All the songs are good. I lend it out to a friend and never got it back so had to go out and buy it again. That's how good it is. And by the way, I'd like to cogratulate both of my cousins, Rogoberto and Rolando Marroquin for a good job. I never thought they'd be all the way up there like they are now. Good job guys!"
5,Jeffrey Stempel Knows His Stuff,I found Jeffrey Stempel's take on the law to be very insightful and compelling. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone interested in insurance. I urge law schools across the nation to require this text. READ IT!
4,"Buy it for Tommy, the hairy bowling pin","Not bad. It's a great read with some really well-twisted plots. The characters are all fun, but it's the dialogue that really makes this book shine. I mean, overall I like it, and I would recommend it. And I'd probably read another book if the same author wrote it (probably). But it's not flawless. There are some great moments, but also a few chapters that don't really seem necessary. Plus, he misquotes Martin Klein, who is a great poet, in the introduction,which kind of bothered me. I would give it 3 1/2 stars actually because of that, but I can't. This book would probably work better as a movie, but there's no sex or monsters so we wont be seeing that any time soon, so just read it as it is."
5,Science & Occultism,A wonderfully written story that marries modern science and occultism via the use of psychedelic drugs. A trapezoidal fest of the macabre!
5,A fantasic book,"I discovered this book when reading another book, so i found a copy. This is one of the best books i have personally read. It is a collection of stories that are just amazing. If horror books interest you at all you should find a copy of this book and buy it because you will enjoy."
3,More of an idea book,"As a beginner this book isn't for me. The detailed written instructions become confusing and I wish Mary Ann would have placed step by step picture examples with the project for me to double check myself to see if I'm understanding her concept(s). To me this book is more of a gallery book that has some great photographs and ideas in it. It'll give your creative eye a different perspective in how to mix color with silver, gold and black to make pretty items."
4,PMC/Mixed Media,Great book with lots of examples and how-to information. Helpful for someone with some experience in working with PMC.
1,Got suckered in on this one. LAME!!!,"Well I guess you can't always go by the first few reviews. This was almost the worst zombie movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, Terrible sound, and camera work. Whats up with the extreme closeups, and hand held camera? The only redeeming quality to this film is the soundtrack, if you like country blues. And the nostalgic drive in movie clips. Besides that, Sorry this movie is a no go. Don't get me wrong I like all types of zombie movies, and try to give them all a chance, but this one... just didn't deserve the one star that I gave it, and definitely not the 5 stars the other folks gave it. Thats my story, and I'm stickin' to it."
1,A horrible waste of $1.99,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY RENTING THIS! Trust me, it's a waste. It must have been filmed on a $100 budget and I'm being generous. Horrible acting, horrible film quality and horrible effects - a REAL horror movie."
2,Read before you buy,"The title is misleading. This is actually a 1962 Judy Garland Special. While a fantastic show if you are fans of Judy, Dean or Frank, it has some serious flaws. The opening and closing credits have been altered and the program has been colorized. The sound quality is great and hasn't been hurt by the stereo effect. The Man And His Music part is just a very lame documentary that uses blurry photos and public domain footage. If you think you'd love the music buy it! As a stickler for authentisity it's a bit painful to watch."
1,WARNING!! DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!,"This is the worst thing I have ever viewed. The DVD is split into 2 segments. The first, is a ""COLORIZED"" Judy Garland episode of poor quality. The second, is a lousy attempt at a documentary. The video quality is poor. It looks like the footage was taken from bad VHS copies of Sinatra in concert. The still photos are all washed out or they are green or red. The editing was worse than a high school student project. Don't waste your money. Not to mention the cheap home computer graphics and amateur narration."
1,From Good to Bad,"What a disappointment! This DVD is a double feature. While the first section is entertaining, showing some good music from Judy and Frank, with a little humor thrown in from Dean, it is the colorization that is poor. The really bad part is the second section. An extremely poor attempt at videomanship!! It plays like a bad lip sync gone worse. Et al....don't buy this DVD."
5,Scale,Works great and a wonderful size. Easy to store. The weight is perfect for wieghing meat and vegetables for the freezer
1,Dead on arrival twice,"We loved our Salter 3003 bought from Amazon a couple of years ago, until it died suddenly last week.So we ordered another Salter 3003 for $38.25 from Amazon. It arrived 3/1/12 but did not work right out of the box. Double-checked the lithium ion battery since we had a fresh spare, no luck. The return label from Amazon was printed after the 'send me another one' box was checked.Amazon delivered another new Salter 3003 the very next day 3/2/12. Unfortunately, that one was DOA as well, 0 for 2 in two days!Of course my original, but now dead, Salter 3003 we used happily for a couple of years is still sitting on my counter. Needless to say, DOA Salter #2 is going back today. I have no idea how to take Salter up on their 10-year warranty for the dead one on my counter. Nor am I going to bother. Who wants an attractive paper weight?"
1,Fragile!,"I cannot comment on the features of this scale as I have been unable to receive one that works! The first one came well boxed and I placed it on the counter and turned it on. The scale gave a series of 8888s and then gave an error message. I called Salter and they stated the scale was broke so I sent it back. Two weeks later I got a new scale by UPS. I opened the box and one of the feet fell out. I called them up and Salter said they could not give me a new one until I sent the old one back. Since each time I have sent the scale back has cost me shipping, I calculate that this scale has cost me almost 50% over market price!"
4,Salter kitchen scale,"This scale was a Christmas gift for my son who is a baker. He saw Alton Brown using it on ""Good Eats"". I am giving it a good review because he just loves it and it does everything he needs.I will, however, say that when he opened it at Christmas time, it was not functioning and we had to send it back for replacement. That said, Amazon's return policy/procedure is quick and easy. So the only reason for this review not being five stars is the initial disappointment of it not working."
4,Salter Kitchen Scale,"The scale is good looking and very easy to use. The only problem I had, was the battery has to be clicked in securely for it to work. Once that was done, it's worked perfectly."
2,Good looking but not built to last.,"We received a Salter 3003 scale as a gift a few years ago. It's sharp-looking, reasonably accurate and has a good, usable range. We used it in the kitchen and also to weigh small packages for shipping. The top is made of glass, so it's fragile and needs to be treated accordingly. On the downside, for the price the scale is more of a toy rather than a tool you'll rely on for many years. For example, the LCD panel on our scale lost the top row of elements so getting a reading gets tricky especially when the weight includes the digit ""7"" which is ambiguous with ""1"" (see pic uploaded above). This is something I'd expect in freebie calculator, not a $50 item."
2,Help,"Has anyone had the problem of the scale weighing in even numbers only when using it to weigh grams? Boy, I sure hope it is pilot error. Please help."
1,STOP! Salter kitchen scale,"If you are looking to buy any of the digital 9 volt battery Salter scales, stop now. They are extremely sensitive to movement and lose the abilty to reset themselves if moved, jostled or over-weighted in anyway. The directions are horrible and the company has no idea what customer service means. Looks great on the counter, and that is about it.Mine is going in the trash, and I am going back to the old fashioned, not so lovely, but fully functional weighted design. See ya Salter....."
3,Don't Wash It,"We really liked this scale and used it every day for over a year. Today, I rinsed it off with the faucet in the sink. It read error. It no longer works at all. I changed the batteries and it said one last error and will no longer come on. Nice good loking scale that works great until you get it wet."
5,"Great, versatile kitchen scale","I love this scale! I have not encountered the design problems with it that some of the other reviewers have, as I invariably use some sort of a vessel on the scale in order to hold what I am weighing, and, as a result, the scale has no trouble weighing multiple items. I have not had a problem with the tare function at all, and I have used the scale heavily for the past three months with fantastic results. I do have to use it on a level surface, but a clear counter top works well for that, and I did not get a scale with uneven footing. I recommend this scale highly!"
2,Numbers changed while sitting on counter,At first this scale performed well. After several months I observed the digital readout changing numbers while sitting on the counter. I would then place something on the scale and even after ten seconds the numbers began changing again. I do not trust this scale. I did replace the batteries but this change of numbers continued.I would not buy this product again.
2,Attractive but a wasted purchase,"The best I can say is that the product is compact, convenient to store, and attractive. Unfortunately, its batteries are the expensive type (two 3-Volt lithium buttons) - and when they died, the trouble commenced: two tiny plastic holders that each allow battery removal both snapped off. Now there's nothing that can hold the batteries in place, barring duct tape.Note: this was not an Amazon.com purchase in the first place, but I ran across this while looking for a new oz./kg. scale. I'm looking for a AAA or AA battery size in the next purchase."
2,Very sensitive to moisture...,"The scale seems to work fine until after even the gentlest of cleaning. It seems that moisture easily creeps inside and causes the ""brains"" to go crazy. I have also noticed that it generally fixes itself after a day or two. Just to be clear, I am talking about a simple wipe down with a slightly damp but certainly not wet paper towel. No matter how careful I am to avoid buttons, seams, openings, etc., the scale goes crazy for at least a day or two. After that it gets better and starts working fine again until the next gentle cleaning... As a kitchen tool it needs a redesign to protect the interior electronics better."
3,Accurate but a little difficult to use,"The unit appears to be quite accurate. However, the readout is WAY too small and some of the information in the readsout like lbs or gms is so small as to require a magnifying glass to see. The same with the labels on the buttons - WAY too small. Otherwise I give it high marks all around. One thing that could improve the unit is a way to hang it up so it doesn't use counter space when not in use. I know you can store it away in the pantry but you will want to keep it close at hand. Isn't that the main idea?"
2,Eats Batteries,"At first we loved this scale, then we noticed it started eating batteries like crazy. It constantly turns on with minimal movement nearby, which is probably why the battery usage is so high. Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, the auto zero function can be really frustrating at times as it likes to auto zero when you've only loaded half your food into the bowl. Unfortunately we bought ours from a local store and not amazon, so we paid even more than is listed on this site. I'm now on amazon looking for a replacement and it's only been six months."
2,"Okay for minor leagues, limited for major leagues.","I found this book to be extremely limited for someone interested in visiting major league ballparks. Many of them have been left out (Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Montreal to name a few). Areas in which there are more than one team, only one team is mentioned (the book mentions that Chicago is one of the cities that has two teams, but neglects to mention the White Sox at all; and Shea stadium in New York is listed in the ""Other New York Baseball"" section, but it is listed after Ebbett's Field and the Polo Grounds which don't exist anymore). The book does seem to have a great deal of information on minor league baseball teams, however. I found Fields of Dreams, (the new, revised edition) to be more helpful in planning my trips."
5,"Great Research, a Little Depressing","A fantastic, well-researched guide to the pre-Christian peoples of Britain, from Stone Age to Christian times. This book is especially good for Neo-Pagans, as it addresses many of the theories popular in Neo-Paganism (e.g., that the Green Man is an old Pagan deity, that Margaret Murray's Witch-Cult really existed, etc.) It's a wonderful antidote to much of the misinformation that gets promulgated in popular writings. The only drawback is that the book gets to be a bit depressing by the end. We know very little about Celtic religion and even less about the faith(s) of their Neolithic forebears. Hutton sticks scrupulously to the evidence, so he frequently ends up saying, ""X is possible, but we don't really know for sure."" More speculation would have spiced the book up -- but then again, more speculation would have made it a less reliable text, so maybe it's better the way it is!"
1,Review of author as opposed to book?,"Just finished submitting a review of Hutton's ""Stations of the Sun,"" then ran across a review of this book by ""wyzardd from Colorado"" (February 7, 2000). Since he says virtually the same thing here that I said there, and since co-reviewer ""A reader from The Former Colonies"" made similar observations in May of '99, perhaps we can conclude that Hutton just isn't all he's cracked up to be."
4,If the Rule of Three is true...,"...then the Gods owe me twenty-seven copies of this book.Over the past year or so, I've bought and given away nine. At last, a book on the roots of Paganism that wouldn't be embarrasing in the bibliography of an undergraduate term paper. The sheer weight of *fact* here is impressive, and the bibliography alone is worth the price of the book.Hutton attempts a rather sweeping debunking of long-standing pseudohistorical myths, and he's done a fairly good job. However, his thoroughness may be a bit off-putting to non-academic readers. There's an awful lot of ""We don't know what really happened, but such-and-such a Victorian author is probably wrong."" This is legitimate in scholarly circles, but the recipients of my nine gift copies have found it a bit tedious."
5,exactly what I expected,was excited about this product as I travel a lot and have no way to keep insulin cold. It works like it says. Ii got the large but could have used the biggest one.Every didabetic should have this product. It is amazing
4,Poucho is Cool,"A few years ago I purchased the Poucho Diabetic Wallet that holds just 2 Disposable Pens - I thought it worked great - kept the pens at just the right temperature in my Las Vegas hotel room. I am now going on a cruise and need a larger Wallet - so, going to give the Large wallet a try. I am confident it will work just as good as the smaller wallet did. I say two thumbs up."
1,Defective Merchandise,"The Medicool Poucho Diabetic Wallet Large arrived promptly after ordering. Upon receipt there was no paperwork with directions or warranty. The evaporative cooling media was very slimy and dissipated into nothing within 30 day of use. I missed the 90 day return date and could not return it so I discarded it. I called Medicool to see if they had something better to keep my insulin in and they informed me that the product I discarded has a one year warranty. The warranty paperwork, had I had it, would have allowed me to replace it directly with Medicool. Just saying......"
1,Didnt work good for me,"Fo some reason mine didnt work at all. It got all slimy and I ended up having to put ice all around it to keep the insulin cold. Good concept, maybe I just got a bad one out o the batch."
3,Mad about this book!,"From 1966 (3rd printing). . . . Another of those nutty publications by Mad magazine and a lot of fun. The first segment is ""Mad's Handy Guide to Languages of the U.S.A."" First example is interpereting rhe language of Madison Avenue. Examples. Someone says: ""Just talking off the top of my head, I would say it looks pretty good."" What the person meant? ""I've been trying to think of the same thing all week."" Or the language of television. What someone might say: ""Our next guest is a different kind of comedian. . . "" What that person actually meant: ""He doesn't get any laughs.""Beyond that? The usual idiots, such as Don Martin. Or TV dinners. Here, a TV genre is matched with TV dinners (that may not even translate for younger readers here). Genre: private eye shows. TV dinner: hard boiled eggs, hot tomates, assorted capers. Well, I didn't say these items were hilarious!!Anyhow, a nice example of Mad's humor. . . ."
3,"Hey, it's just like the magazine, but shorter and thicker","This is the twenty-first book in the Mad Magazine series, which demonstrates how popular this wacky brand of humor really was. When it was at the peak of it's popularity, Mad Magazine was everywhere an adolescent boy looked, and this set of paperback books was an interesting attempt to carry the appeal of the magazine into a paperback book format.The book is not much different from the magazine. In this particular book, a wide variety of artists have their work featured, which is a step up from the editions that feature the work of one particular artist.There are Hollywood parodies, shots from American life, the ever-popular Spy vs. Spy series, and all of the other staples that made the series a success. Some of the material has aged well; some of it just hasn't.If you're a Madaholic, you should pick this collection up for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, I would stick with the magazine."
5,Great Fan,"This is a great Fan. Installation may be a challenge for a person's first fan but fairly easy if you installed fans before.As always this fan is quiet even at high speed. The paint job is great. I wanted a flat finish and the satin white fits that bill.It's heavier than the other previous Hunter fans I installed but it meets all my expectations.This is my fifth Hunter fan but first Paramount XP model.All in all, It's a great buy and I plan to purchase another..................................................................................................................Well, I did purchase the second fan by another vendor but still through Amazon. Same great fan. Great delivery. Paid about $2.00 more but worth it! Still happy with the second purchase."
4,Seems to be protecting my curl,"Doesn't seem to ""soften"" like most conditioners, but that may be by design. My curl and color seem to be protected with this conditioner."
1,Yuck!,"I had such high hopes for this product given all of the rave reviews I read. However, I was horribly disappointed. I have naturally wavy hair and hoped this product would allow me to wear my hair wavy. Not only did it NOT help my wavy hair but dried it out, made it frizzier and had a horrible smell."
4,curls,"I bought the shampoo and the conditioner. In the shower the hair seemed stiff and a little odd, but keep in mind I live in Colorado above Denver's mile high...that said..I used this with bed head curl stuff..it made the hair a bit stiff..not much...and I definitly have curls now."
4,Very interesting,"Tells the story of a dark age in which some Hollywood filmers become prey to a witchhunt. 'If you are suspicious, then you are guilty.' As a non-US person, I was astonished to see the final session (US Senate hearing?), where the judge, jury and the prosecution were all the same; what's more, the manner those judges (?) passed judgement knocked me off. What a fair trial! And it is a true story that happened in the USA!!"
2,Liberalism's Passion Play,"I'm so tired of Hollywood whining about the McCarthy era. Most recently it was ""Good Night and Good Luck""; before that, ""The Majestic""; before *that*, ""The Crucible."" They're like a dog with an old slipper it can't stop chewing. Hollywood's thirst for victim status needs to be slaked wherever and whenever possible, but it sure does make for boring viewing. The only thing that saves this film from total ignominy is a passel of great performances. Contrived performances, but great nonetheless.Note to the producers: put your talent to more worthy efforts next time. To paraphrase a famous McCarthy era Hollywood luminary: ""Have you no shame Hollywood? At long last, have you no shame? The McCarthy era is dead!"""
1,Guilty by Fact,This is just another pro-communist film that tries to re-paint the 1950's as some type of ruthless time subjected by patriots against innocent leftists. The reality is that Hollywood was full of not only leftwingers but with hardcore communists as well. These people conspired with Soviet agents to tilt the U.S. to the Left and to aid the Soviets in their global war against the U.S.This film is pure lies in the way it tries to portray these communists as innocent filmakers. The reality is that they were quite guilty and the evidence demonstrating this was without a doubt quite valid.There's nothing to see in this film that would relate to historical fact so don't waste your time.
3,An okay thriller,"This movie a alright. The acting was a little cheesey, and the sex scenes (described as HOT on the back of the DVD)were standard fare.The plotline revolved around an assasination attempt, and was a little confusing. And one of the characters got aways with murder (literally) in the end. I really wanted her to get her dues, but maybe they figured she was justified?"
5,angie is everhot,"this is got to be one of the better of angie everhart films great story,filmed well check this one out if you get thee chance"
1,I'd rather go to the dentist than watch this film.,"This is one of the most boring and poorly executed horror films (if you could call this a horror film), I've seen in my whole entire life. Where are the horror scenes? The story goes nowhere. I could not care less for any of the characters. I did not understand the apparent symbolism this movie tries to carry across neither did I care whether I understood it or not. Definitely stay away from this film."
4,"A good movie, for horror fans! I liked it!","If you want ILM special effects, famous actors and to eat popcorn while watching - forget this movie. But if you like movies where the director left something to think for the audience and if you prefer psychologic horror and atmosphere - you will definately like this horror-puzzle movie!"
2,"Stink, Stank, Stunk!","This 1998 version of the 1963 orignal is a pathetic attempt to scare, with its mundane ""slamming-door-type"" effects and stolen Jabob's Ladder gouls! I was very disappointed by this cheap imitation to conjour the allure and intrigue of the original masterpiece. I expected more, because of its later date of production. The only pleasant thing I can say about this movie,save your money and buy the original version, whether it be re-mastered, colorized, or un-cut, but don't buy this!"
3,maybe it is a bootleg,"KDHT-FM in Denver broadcast a number of live shows from Ebbets Field in the 70s. Many of them circulate among traders of live shows, and this is one of them. I've heard a copy from FM and it's pretty good for what it is but it's not commercial quality. I don't know whether Pilot paid royalties to the band or not. I can't say it's a bootleg because I simply don't know, but other reviewers' comments and the fact that the show was broadcast suggest it might be. My 3 star rating is because I had to provide some rating to add this comment. I have not heard the Pilot release."
1,live ripoff,This may be one of the worst CD's I have ever purchased. It is intersting that nowhere in the title does it mention that it is a live album. The vocals are terrible & the mix even worst. Sounds like it was recorded in a trash can & that's where it belongs. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!
3,Pity they couldn't have found a better gig,"I've waited a long time for this one, having been a fan since their first album, and having been told how great this lineup was live.Well, all I can say is, they must have caught Craig Fuller on an 'off' night, because his voice is totally *shot*. The instrumental playing is just fine, but it took me several listens before I was convinced that this actually was Craig.But if it's the only live souvenir we're going to get, I'll take it anyway."
1,Way Over Priced,"This book in excellent condition is worth 40 to 50 dollars max.Robert D.Hawes,New Hampshire"
5,Outstanding,Rosa Guy's Ruby is an excellent piece of reading material. I myself have read it several times over and the intensity of the writing pulls the reader right in. The reader is made to understand all of Ruby's frustrations. I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book is a must read.
2,"Ruby, by Rosa Guy - review","My fifteen-year-old daughter is bright, obedient, and appriciative - but I learned an important lesson when I ordered this childhood favorite of mine... ""IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A BOOK TO GO OUT OF STYLE OR BECOME OUT-DATED!"" My daughter is an avid reader, and she's usually not too picky with her reading materials, but presenting her with this book was like showing the movie 'The Sound of Music' to an atrium full of eigth graders and expecting them to love it. If you want to present your teenage daughter with one of your old favorites, then 'The Outsiders,' or anything by S.E. Hinton would be the route to go - defanately not the Rosa Guy route!"
4,So not Fake Rock,Takes you back and revives those feelings and emotions that have long past. It now seems like a magical time in music. Great Album.
5,Beautiful!,"If I ever had to defend rock'n'roll in front of a grand jury, I'd submit this DVD as ""Exhibit A"". A stunning Dolby Digital 5.1 channel masterpiece. Play it with a good sound system. Crank it up.I have to admit that I really like U2's sound so I unashamedly admit that this review is biased."
4,Improved audio,"I've found that it's the concerts on video that I most often watch nowadays. Always enjoyed this disk on DVD and naturally wanted to upgrade to Blu-Ray. If you have a killer sound system that supports DTS audio you're going to love the improvment. Can't say the video is much improved since this was shot way back in 1988. I'm watching on a 60"" Pioneer Plasma and don't see all that much difference. Go for the sound if you have the equipment for it."
2,Where's the HD Audio?!,"The movie/concert is great. I am sure the video is great on this Blu-Ray disc. However, the sound track is the same 'ol Dolby Digital that is found on the DVD. This is a concert film. The soundtrack is more important than the picture. I expect better from a band like U2."
5,U2 WORLD INVASION!!!!,"U2 is a legendary rock band and RATTLE and Hum is the moment when they conquer the world...Well, JOSHUA TREE was this moment, but RATTLE documents this time, plus got a lot of great great songs! U2 is undoubtly one of the greatest things to happen in the music history, and BONO is a very cool guy who cares about this planet! THANK YOU, U2! YOUR GREAT MUSIC WILL LIVE FOREVER!!!!"
3,Subpar Sound,"The audio is so soft that when U2 members are talking, I can hardly hear what they are mumbling about. The subtitles came in handy here.Features such as scene selection and subtitles are hardly special as claimed but rather de rigueur.Rattle And Hum is at best a long form music video as there is no much dialogue to begin with. Still, it is a great concert film.The only reason to get this DVD is that this film boasts 11 songs that are not on the album."
2,Disappointed,I recently purchased this for my Toshiba A2 HD DVD player. Although I have not seen the entire disc-what I have seen so far is disappointing-too grainy. I realize it was filmed in a dark concert hall. My 2 biggest complaints are:1-angels of harlem-is in a small studio-not the concert footage (which I thought it would be.)2-all I want is you-the last song on the DVD-is played while the credits are running!!
2,trying the american dream,"for anyone expecting u2 to be sincere,forget it.This is u2 at ther bombastic and patronising worst.if you want to see u2 at ther live best get the superb zooropa vid otherwise watch u2 be a walking,talking jookbox"
3,Still haven't found... all I want is you...,"Since I never saw this in the theaters, I was unaware that the footage of 'ALL I WANT IS YOU' -- which lived on MTV for months -- wasn't from this picture. So buying the DVD was a big disappointment. It's a shame said footage wasn't added as a bonus feature, to 'complete' this piece... as it were."
2,Review of the HD DVD version only,"Almost everybody knows how great this video is. Some versions of the songs are extraordinary. But as I said, everybody knows that.I'm here to talk about exclusively of the HD DVD version which in my opinion is quite bad. I own the regular DVD and they both have the same video quality, which is not great. One should expect great video from an HD DVD, but this is not the case, so if you own the DVD don't bother. If you own the VHS, just buy the regular DVD. Oh, by the way I just have a 720p HDTV, so I haven't watch it on a 1080p HDTV, but I don't think it would make any difference."
4,It's a musical Journey....,"Having never been to a U2 concert, but still being a fan of their music, I bought this DVD to experience the band at the height of their artistic powers, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint one bit. If you're fortunate enough to have a decoder with a ""Live Stadium"" setting, this would be the DVD to play it on. Tracks that particularly stood out were ""bullet the blue sky"" and ""with or without you"", both of which highlighted the band's excellent showmanship with the use of very effective stage lighting. Not too be missed also is Bono's political statement made in ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", finished of nicely with ""in the name of love"". If you don't get goosebumps at some stage of watching this....you're probably dead. The ultimate concert DVD by far"
4,"If you like U2, you'll like this DVD","This DVD is a slightly dressed up version of the VHS tape, with some introductory panorama shots overlaying the opening tracks. The sound quality is great, the ""grainy"" black and white is intentional as is the eventual transition to color toward the second half of the movie (I saw it in the theatre on 70mm...) If you already have the VHS, it is worth getting the DVD just so you can skip to your favorite tracks. There is no new material on the disk, even though it claims to hold ""Ruby Tuesday"" and ""Sympathy for the Devil"" - they have just put that down on the track list since Bono sings a few lines from those songs towards the end of ""Bad"". Like I said, if you like U2, you should own this DVD."
5,breathtaking live,"Other reviews seem cover it pretty well; breathtaking live footage, at times a little too slickly produced perhaps but still awesome and powerful, interspersed with uneven interview segments and somtimes-hokey ""discovering America"" footage. But I thought I would mention one thing that really struck me about this film; I have never seen a movie so vividly capture the experience of what it is like to perform onstage. The use of black and white adds to this a lot; when you're up there, with stage lights in your face, colors do indeed become muted and the world takes on a black-and-white character. And there are those shots, looking out into the black, endless void of the audience, that perfectly capture that weirdness of feeling almost alone, while standing in front of thousands of people. Great band, dynamic performances, but the ""you are there"" aspect puts it over the top."
2,"Great moments, but overall a disappointment","I'm a relatively new U2 fan who only became an obsessive after All That You Can't Leave Behind, so I wasn't really around when this movie was released. But watching it now I can sort of understand why the critics ripped into it so badly at the time. Make no mistakes, there are still some incredibly powerful moments and performances to be found, such as the blistering performance of Sunday Bloody Sunday, swaggering Helter Skelter and ever-transcendent Bad. Unfortunately, one could almost get a feeling that the band went into this project with an aim to make themselves look as dour and humourless as humanly possible. They come off as overly serious and distant, and if I saw the film without any knowledge of U2 I'd probably be left with a feeling that I was watching the world's dullest band. For a U2 experience, I'd recommend about any other concert video they've done, with ZooTV and Elevation being the top picks."
4,All-Time Classic,"If you like U2, you have probably already seen this video or probably already own it. This is a must see video."
5,U2 RATTLE AND HUM,Awesome video. Better than being at the concert. I'm thinking this moment of the band is probably the best than any of their future DVDs.
5,U2 al 100%,"indiscutiblemente su mejor epoca esta aqui en este dvd no me agrada mucho blnco y negro pero ami gusto sigue siendoel mejor dvd comparado con live en boston ,go home,live from sidney,popmart en mexico y otro que esta gravado en 1983under a blood red sky COMPRALO NO TE ARREPENTIRAS!"
4,U2 - Rattle & Hum [HD DVD],Product was returned due to some technical dificulties to play the DVD. Full refund was received within 3 days.Product was returned due to some technical dificulties to play the DVD. Full refund was received within 3 days.
5,One Of My Fav Music DVDs,Any true U2 fan needs to have this DVD in their collection. After I viewed it the first time I check out it's price on the Amazon web site and for what the price was I bought 2 more copies for co-workers when I retired. From the B.B.King section where he plays his irresistable sounding Lucille to the songs of The Joshua Tree era the sound is simply wonderful !!! Such Value !!!
3,mostly run-of-the-mill,"DARKER MASQUES is a nearly 600-page collection of horror stories and poems previously collected in MASQUES III and MASQUES IV. While the roster of authors is mostly first-rate, few of these stories rank among their best; some are even rather obvious or pointless. Out of 59 entries, I woould only recommend three: ""Julia's Touch"" by David T. Connolly, which has more emotional depth in its three pages than many novels, ""My Private Memoirs of the Hoffer Stigmata Pandemic"" by Dan Simmons, which has a sick, albeit enjoyable, sense of justice as its theme, and ""The Secret"" by Steve Allen (!!!), which evokes just the right note of pathos. For the most part, the other stories aren't bad, they're just not exceptional.PS: for some reason, the authors names are not listed with the story titles on the CONTENTS page."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"THE SEEDS WERE FINE, BUT IT CONTAINED TO MUCH TRASH. I TRIED TO CALCULATE THE PER CENT TRASH AND THE BEST ESTIMATE WAS ABOUT 15-20 PERCENT."
1,Dissapointing Region 2 Set,I bought this in hopes of getting the better resolution of PAL's 576 height. These disks are single-layer rather than the dual-layer as you would expect. The resulting low bitrate used negates any better resolution I was hoping for.
1,Over priced.,"This is a great show, one of my favorites next to Angel, Stargate and Buffy but the price is insane. Get a clue sellers. A devoted fan could easilly go to one of the various online stores and purchase Region 2 The Farscape Complete Series Box Set with Seasons 1 - 4 and The PeaceKeeper War movie for roughly $430. They can then come to Amazon and buy a Region Code Free DVD player for $30 or more depending on how fancy you want to get. But in the end they have a brand new Box set and ended up paying less than they would for all the over inflated prices for the various Farscape season sets on here."
5,Get your Sci-Fi fix,"If you're really needing a show that makes you feel as though you've left your living room and gone on one wild ride, this is the show for you. I've not look forward to watching a show since STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION was on TV. The stories are strong and engrossing and the characters are believeable.Brian Henson (Jim Henson Company) has got a real winner with this show and now that the whole season is coming out on DVD, it will be difficult not to do a marathon all at once!Save money, don't buy the individual discs...buy the whole season and have a family night."
1,I'm mad at Amazon,"I was watching free with Prim. But now it's for sale. So, why do I have a prime account if the videos are for sale. No, I won't watch them get hooked and then buy them. ""IF"" I buy a movie and/or TV show I will wait to find it at a garage sale or ""maybe"" at a USED dvd store. I do not want to buy the right to stream it. If I am to buy it I WANT the dvd in my hand.SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!!!"
3,Awesome...but why so expensive?,"Great show. Nice light Sci-Fi that is just pure fun but way, way, way, way, way to expensive.Doesnt' beging to jibe with other full seasons. Way too much other entertainment out there by the season for far less to make this a worthwhile purchase."
2,"Great Show, rotten DVD Mastering","I love the show and think it was a crime to cancel it in the fourth season without a proper final episode.ADV has produced one of the worst DVD's I have unfortunately ever owned.You are forced to watch ADV's previews every time you put a disk in your player. This may be player specific but, my player will not let me advance throught the previews to get to the show. I think it is a DVD mastering trick to force you to watch the previews. I don't know about you but I don't want to watch ADV's comercials on somthing I just payed for.The extra material is repetitive using the same material over and over again. Scene brakes don't seem to be in logical locations.All in all I'm sorry I bought this DVD. If you can get it from another studio source please do."
5,Farscape All seasons,There are not enough stars for this series! The characters are great and I love the Henson designs. I am enchanted.
4,Farscape Season 1,"Very good science fiction, using the Muppets studio for animation of the charaters. I enjoyed the series very much, watching it on my Ipad the graphics were stunning and HD in guality."
4,Farscape,Got to view the first 4 or 5 episodes of Season 1 when the series went from being free for Prime members to $1.99 an episode. Guess I won't be watching the rest of the series.
5,Loved it!,"Great chance to watch the development of story line and characters from start to season 4 finish. Took a while to watch all 4 seasons, there is a lot of SCFI entertainment to take in."
5,Fantastic!,Love Farscape. Have watched it since it first came on Sci-Fi and just loved the characters and the story line.
3,"Great show, but get the re-release for better disc quality","I love Farscape - it's a truly original space adventure show where humans aren't the saviors and masters of the universe, for once. But the first release of season box sets still had crappy disc quality. The DVD quality of the more recent re-release of the complete Farscape is MUCH better (and often on sale!). Even if you already have some individual seasons, it's worth re-buying the complete series in order to have DVDs that will consistently work."
4,Good show -- but overpriced DVD set,"Farscape was a wonderful, innovative show. Unfortunately, they've done a very poor job of packaging the DVDs. The current price is $120 for 22 episodes -- more than twice the price of Stargate SG-1 for the same number of episodes, and almost three times the price of Buffy or Angel. They need to repackage this in a more affordable form before I collect all the seasons."
1,Couldn't finish,Because FarScape was dropped from Prime I could not finish watching. Real shame because FarScape appears to be a fine SIFi show
2,farscape,why did season 1 get moved from Prime? I was in the middle of watching episodes. And now it costs to see it? Why are the rest of the seasons still available free on Prime?
1,CD's Scratched and Unable to View,"I will need to return the entire set since some of the CD's are damaged (scratched) and unable to view. It was my understanding that this set was new and never used by anyone else, so I'm a little confused why so much damage is on the CD's."
3,"Bad Acting, Bad Writing",".. Otherwise it's Ok.The main character, John Chricton is enough to ruin this series. Can't act and his character is dumb for a NASA scientist.Admittedly, I've only watched the 1st 2 episodes, but so long as the main character is so bad, it feels like a waste of time.Apart from the usual infantile scripts, there are going to be so many inconsistencies/holes in the scripts it'll drive me nuts. (For example, already the writers appear to forget that aliens need a translation device to communicate with each other. And that's just between the 1st and 2nd episode.)Love Firefly .. that is class. This doesn't even compare with the original ST for quality."
1,REALLY BAD!,"Was hoping for a ""Battlestar Gallactica"" or ""Firefly""...NOT! This is very dated and the FXs are bad. Read other reviews and obviously their taste leaves much to be desired."
1,It makes Lost in Space look good.....,"Yeah, I remember this show as having a lot of bad cg effects and lots of all too looking cheaply designed puppets that looked too much like they were made from rubber.Great acting. No. Great writing. No. Waste of Time, Yes."
3,Well done --just not for me,"This will not be a popular review, but it may assist someone else who shares my taste.This is a very professionally done series, but, it is written for a younger audience. In my estimation, the writing and plot is geared for the young teen set: were I 12 years old again I would love this.But now, in my advancing adulthood, the heavy soundtrack, the silly bodily-function quips, the one-dimensionality of the characters, just does not appeal.A very good show, but not for adults."
5,"Great show, but currently relatively expensive","This is a great show. However, at $120 per season, it comes to a rather expensive $6.55 per hour of entertainment.If you compare that to:24 Hours: $2.33/hourAlias: $3.18/hourWestwing: $2.36/hourFirefly: $3.11/hourSix feet Under: $4.92/hourSopranos: $5.74/hourand even movies likeStar Wars episode I: $6.32/hourStar Wars episode II: $5.92/hourFarscape's pricing is over the top. I'll wait until the prices come down before adding Farscape to my collection.Hope this helps"
1,Say it isn't so!,"I too was in the middle of watching season 1 free with my Prime membership. The chief reason I paid for a prime membership was so I could have access to this show and a few others Netflix took off Instant. Now Amazon does the same thing. Why with no warning? For me my Prime membership won't be worth it if the shows I want to watch all switch to pay per episode. I don't get it, unless of course you get us hooked so we'll pay to see the rest. I guess I'm glad I kept Netflix, at least I can get Farscape in the mail."
5,This is a GREAT DVD!!,"This is so cool! It's sorta wierd in the begining, well for me it was. But after I watched the next few I began to understand what was going on. I've never even missed a single episode, I loved this series sow much I watched one episode right after the other for 8 hours straight. This is the best sci-fi type series I've ever seen. But sadly, there going to stop making it at season 4 episode 22. Well me and a whole bunch of my friends thinks it's kewl, but some people may not.Ahh, wellIf anyone buys it I hope they'll like it."
1,skip this one,"Just like the single DVDs, this is a money waster. Buy the full season 1 - Farscape rocks, but why buy it twice just to see the other episodes?"
5,I wish I had more!!!!!,"After watching the last episode of season 4, I was devistated. I was left with an amazing cliffhanger, and a canceled show. I had to get more Farscape. I started my collection with this box set. The episodes alone were worth the price. Interviews, commentary, drawings, and other goodies were as wonderful as the delicious icing on a cake. I have seen each of these episodes countless times, and cannot wait until I can afford the full second season. I am hopeful that more fresh Farscape will come back to television. May you enjoy this DVD set, and may your family cherish it for generations to come."
5,Farscape season one box set,"You can't lose buying anything Farscape, to catch up on the farscape campaign, go to >savefarscape.com<"
3,Great collection,"These are great episodes from episode one, just not the ones I would have picked. Farscape is the best scifi show ever! I wish it had the episode where they pick up Chiana but hey, pickers cant be choosers..."
5,Utterly Fantastic!,"Farscape easily fits in among the finest sci-fi television series ever! It's got everything, drama, romance, humor (a lot of humor), action, suspense... It's unlike any other sci-fi show. Absolutely worth viewing. But, unlike some other sci-fi shows, it's complelely serial, so start w/ season 1, ep 1 and go from there and you will not be disappointed!"
5,Excellent!,"Subject lines says it all, I watch the whole series and the PeaceKeeper Wars is the closer. My second best scfi series, which thwre was a revival or spin off."
2,Terrible encoding,"This IS Farscape, so the content itself is superb. However, the video encoding here is absolutely terrible. I have downloaded a number of other shows from Amazon that play just fine, but in this case there is a frequent and regular annoying regular stutter that makes picture and sound halt for a second. This happens in every episode. Also, the picture quality is blurry, the sound is full of static. This is by far the worst quality of all Amazon Unbox videos I have seen.Unfortunately, this is the only simple way of seeing Farscape Season 1 currently. The DVDs are not available, Netflix doesn't have this season, and iTunes is significantly more expensive."
4,Product good shipping needs work,"The product looks great I have watched all of t he videos and they came out great. The only problem I had was when it arrived a few of the cases had broke the clasp that holds the dvds in place. So in the process of moving they slid around in the case. The movies were handled with enough care that the scratches possed no harm in viewing the dvds. It is clear some harm was done to the cases, but there is no skipping so it's fine. The group I used also got it here in less time than they predicted."
5,Farscape,"The entire Farscape series is a marvelous addition from the Jim Henson Company. If you like Stargate SG-1, Babylon, Battlestar Galactica, and other such Sci-Fi shows, you would probably enjoy this one as well. I highly recommend it."
1,Great show. SHAME ON AMAZON FOR ENCOURAGING PIRACY.,"Every person with access to the Internet has the option to pirate media. There is no limitation to what we can get from bit torrents. My family made a decision a couple of years ago to dispense with cable and using a Roku, a netflix supscription and then prime instant video to live cable-free without resorting to piracy. The kind of disgusting behavior exhibited by Amazon this week in yanking Farscape from free to practically fifty dollars a season is begging us to resort to piracy. We really love this show, but the only way we can watch it now is to steal it. What is wrong with this industry?"
1,Subtitles erratic,"So far, 3 of the 12 episodes have no English subtitles for deaf or hearing impaired people. Box advertising says they do have closed captioning. I get no response from ADV when I email them about this. If you need words, you are out of luck. Great show, horrible DVDs. When you pay $ 100 for a set like this, you don't expect this type of carelessness. Tried to see subtitles on 3 seperate DVD players. Nothing."
2,I really wanted to like this,"As a fan of SiFi in general, and a fan of some of the actors/actresses that have moved on to other work, I wanted to like this but was disappointed. It just seemed to be poorly made. The scrips were weak, and the characters shallow."
5,UPSET with AMAZON,"I was in the middle of this series in Season 3 and loved the show. I didn't know about it when it was on TV. I'm shocked to log on today and find that it is no longer on PRIME for free. This really sucks... Sorry Amazon, I won't be buying the episodes after you baited me. What a bunch of jerks!!!!"
4,GREATEST Sci-fi since star wars.,"What a start to your collection, great set, but what gives with all the others being seperate, even I am not sure I am willing to spend that money to buy the balances seperatley. To top it off, the series is stopped. BUMMER............"
4,"Farscape goes far indeed, in first season","I really like this series. It has little in common with Star Trek (which I love), so there's more to ""discover."" The first season does more than standard character development. It maps out the basic theme, ideas, yada, and pulls you into the saga. Crichton (the only representative of the human species) is likable, but we already know him--we're human too. It's the ensemble cast that glows.An opaque review, but like I wrote, there's much to discover, and I don't want take that anyway."
1,Is this some kind of joke?,I read reviews on Farscape and it sounded pretty good since I am a big fan of science fiction. I bought complete season one but haven`t even gone past Dvd one.The reviews were pointless.
1,If only I could rate this lower,"This is the most juvenile, poorly acted, poorly written, vile show of all time. It rates right up there with a circus freak show but with drool, violence and mistrust. The plot line is as flat as the characters. I can't believe it has survived - a testament to lower expectation and sub-standard accomplishment. What a waste of time, energy, and finance."
4,Great show,"It's nice to go abck and watch this again. The stories/writing are very good, althought he acting is somewhat campy. the only thing that bothers me is that if John is a ""rocket scientist"", why does he soetimes act like he knows nothing of science at all?"
5,"Great Series, I was late in discovering it, but I loved it so much.","In 2011, my daughter was a student in an acting school with one of the cast of this show(Gigi Edgley who I never got to meet). So I watched it and was hooked. This is such a great series, anyone who enjoyed star trek will surely like some part of this show. It is about space travel and aliens and it is awesome! It has a little cheesiness at some points, but didn't star trek? This show brought me through a tough time in my life, I used to get lost in it for hours, watching episode after episode. I love the characters (Areryn, Chiana, and Zhaan are all easy on the eyes), they are all unique, and each one brings in a cool back story. I am bummed that I missed all the conventions and autograph stuff they did when it was on tv. But I'm happy that I found it, great watch."
3,"Get on ""The A-List""","What would you do to be on The A-List?Welcome to Southern California, home of celebrities, palm trees and money. THE A-LIST follows a day in the life of New York teenager Anna, who visits her father for New Year's Eve. In the course of 24 hours, Anna's world is turned upside down. She finds herself kissing a college guy on a plane, falling for him, meeting girls her own age (and in her own money bracket) who are chic-er-than-thou, getting involved in a love quadrangle, attending a wedding, buying naughty clothes, boarding a boat, and more.In other words, it is like a Friday on a soap opera. If you enjoy the GOSSIP GIRL series or Dawson's Creek, you'll like THE A-LIST. Quick read, guilty pleasure."
5,Aloha!!! A Gem of a Book!!!,"This book is sooooo awesome!!! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes the Gossip Girl series, or even if you don't. It is very funny and the author does a great job portraying realistic human emotions in a setting that is not necessarily a reality for most teenagers. If you are looking for a fast read that is fun, enertaining, has cute guys, and awesome parties (not to mention great fashion lingo) then you will definitely enjoy this book!!! A MUST read!!! A fantasy to most, but entertaining none the less. (...)You won't regret it!!! (:"
2,Ehhh.,"I have read most of the trashy teen novels out there, and i would have to say this is one of the bad ones. Along with Gossip girl they get boring really quick becuase they kind of repeat the same kind of things. It is a basic storyline that is way too predictable. I have indeed read all of the books. The last one i ended up not finishing because itj ust bored me completly"
1,A test of the emergency suck system,"Give me a break. Even a non-reader can tell that this isn't even a BOOK! This is just Zoey Dean's idea of competing with Cecily von Ziegesar - she's just fanning the flames of the Battle of The Novels About Overprivileged Teenage Girls. On top of that, her style of writing lacks the wit and intrigue of von Ziegesar's. If she has any style of writing at all. I advise all readers to stick with Gossip Girl and put this stuff on the clearance rack, and soon."
2,Too much of a Wannabe,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me since she knew how much I enjoy the Gossip Girl Series. Unfortunately, from page 1, it seems like this book is wanting to be too much like gossip girl. The only differences I could find between the two are that The A-List takes place in Calfornia instead of New York, the format isn't in the webpage style, and Gossip Girl is a much better read. I'm not saying that the book is completely horrible, but if you have read Gossip Girl before, your in for a bit of a disappointment. Those who haven't read GG series may find this book more enjoyable than I did."
4,Fun Hollywood Chick Lit,"Anna Percy is sick of following the This is How We Do Things Rulebook: East Coast WASP Edition, so she decides leave Manhattan's Upper East Side and go out and visit her father in L.A. On her first day alone, she gets drunk on the plane, hooks up with a guy while drunk on the plane, attends a famous actor's wedding, and ends the day in vinyl pants on a guys boat. But three of L.A.'s ""It"" Girls, Cammie, Dee, and Sam, are determined to make Anna's stay a miserable one. However, Anna is determined to have a great time, trashing her mother's rulebook in the process. This books doesn't contain a lot of substance, but it's a great beach read."
4,it was good,"i liked this book. zoey dean has a writing style that ive never read before. im sure that, when my mom got this for me, she didn't know how much cursing was in it. i love the scene where anna and ben make out in the plane bathroom-until they're busted.its a good book worth reading. ive read better, but its still good."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"Oh my gosh! This book was excellent. I bought the book Friday and well I finished it Sunday. I usually don't like to read, but this book was really really good. I would say, if you don't like to read, read this book. It is really good!"
1,I'm only a few pages into it but...IT'S HORRIBLE!!,"Ok, I'm not even far into the book yet, but this book is terrible! Judging by the first paragraph, you would think this book would be funny, but it totally isn't! First off, HOW OLD ARE THESE GIRLS!??! It says on the back that they go to school, so, let's say they are in college, so let's say maybe 23. Cynthia, a character in the novel, will fly anywhere at any given time, made out with A MIDDLE AGED MAN, and let a man paint a naked picture of her. What is Zoey Dean trying to teach kids? That if you are rich and beautiful and have $8,000 that you run rapid? Also, judging from the back of this book, the main character, Anna, flies to LA, and in just one day, is invited to a wedding, a party in a back lot, and falls in love. HELLO!??! Things don't happen that quickly! Is Zoey Dean trying to tell us that if you are rich and beautiful and popular that everything will go swimmingly? NO. IT WON'T. I do NOT recommend reading this book."
4,a-list fun!,"Young and innocent Anna Percy suddenly isn't so innocent when she decides to move from her hometown, NYC, to LA. Anna is suddenly swept up into a whirlwind of adventure, starting right off on the flight to LA, where she meets the alluring Ben Birnbaum. Over the course of about 24 hours, Anna reunites with her passed-out father, goes to several a-list parties, and experiences the true LA. This series is on my list of a-list books."
2,WHERES THE ENDING?!,"I spend this entire book hoping for some kind of climax... no such luck. She breaks up with the guy we all thought was perfect, and we're not even sure why! The Gossip novels have leads to the next story, this one doesnt. All i know is shes going to BHH and theres something going on with Adam. Definatly not soemthing to buy. Get it from the library if you must have soemthing to fill the time until the next gossip girl comes out."
3,well.......,"I thought this book kind of lacked a plot. it was trying to be a gossip girl wanna-be....i also thought the ending was pretty bad...maybe the author did that so there could be a second, but whatever the reason, no book should end that way."
2,Average at BEST,"The prolouge is very hard to understand. I did read it although and some-how, it really was not needed. It went into the plane ride which was a little fast between Ben and Anna, but its a fiction book... whatever. It was going great from there on. The end of the book must had been the worst! I could not belive she just did that to him! She knew he was a loving guy and cared for people, what else was he to do? Look i don't want to spoil it for any of you who DO decide to read it, but im just saying, you will HATE the ending! I know i did! But maybe the second book will clear it up better? The only part of the end that intriuged me was Adam and Anna. Book 2 maybe? On another, im totally syked for Gossip Girl Book 5!! Great books (Gossip Girl i mean) They truly keep you hooked!"
2,Not that great,"Lifestyles of the rich and famous...makes me feel like I'm watching *My Super Sweet 16* or something similar. Makes you wonder how people can really be that over the top, extravagant, etc."
4,Great Book!,"I really enjoyed this book, I bought it on Saterday evening and finished it on Sunday morning. I let my best friend borrow it this morning and she finished it a couple hours ago...It was a great book, however I thought the ending could have been a lot better. Also, before every clothing article and accessory she put a brand...and it was sort of annoying because it would have been just as, if not more effective if she had put ""...checked her lip gloss"" instead of...""Checked her Stila lip gloss"". I would reccomend this book to any girl or guy who enjoys a story of extremely wealthy girls who are seniors in high school, who party, and do anything to get what they want. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
4,a good book,"I really enjoyed this book. I have read all the Gosip Girl novels as well and I rank this book up there with them. The main character, Anna is really likeable, and so is Ben, until you get to the end, I was disappointed with the ending, I hope the author continues it so it can be a series."
2,Bad imitation of Gossip Girl,"I went to go and buy the fourth Gossip Girl, but they were all out, so I thought The A-List would be just as good. What a waste!! This book was way worse than any of the Gossip Girls.. it was obvious that the author was attempting to imitate certain aspects of GG series. There are so many stupid little sub-plots going on, metaphors that just don't make sense, and references to seemingly important events that are never brought up again. Zoey Dean is obviously trying way too hard. There is no comparison here; the author of Gossip Girl knows how to make you love or loathe her characters, and her writing leaves you wanting more. The A-List just made me want my 10 bucks back."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This book was great. I read it in about three days and was sad when it ended. The A List is much more realistic then Gossip Girl because there are problems in the familes, like Cammie's mom dieing. Also, Not all of the charcters are having sex. I like the wit of the charcters and i love how nasty Cammie is. This is a great read( But don't take ikt sourisly)."
2,I don't know...,"I kind of hate reading these kind of books. Really, I don't know why they use paper on these. I borrowed it from my sister one boring summer night with nothing else to read.Because for me, they sort of waste your time. What are you learning from them? The only lesson they teach...they don't really teach anything.Some of these teen-girly-books are good. Sarah Dessen, Judy Blume, etc. I'm 15, I like them.Can't you just read a tabloid? Or watch E?"
1,"Bad, bad, book.","It was not a good book like I suspected. It was very innapropriate, with drug mentions, sex stuff, and lots of cussing. I was disgusted. I would not reccomend this book, even if you like others like it, because this one is terrible."
3,Good book-- Bad Ending,"I really liked the book. There's always stuff happening and it switches between four different girls POV, all who are in love with the same guy. But the ending was dumb and if I was in her position I wouldn't have done that at all. Plus-- she already graduated from high school. Even if the internship fell through, why is she still going? It also would've been better if her being sick actually contributed to the story. I thought it would but that turned out to be dumb too."
3,vicky-o,this book is shallow and has the depth of an onion. without the skin.dont read it be happy. read itcry
3,Wannabe Gossip Girl,"It was interesting at first. It was catty and entertaining but as i turned each page, I could see how superficial and unrealistic the events in this book were. Its about a rich girl, Anna Percy, who decides to move to LA for a while so she can let loose. She gets to attend a celebrity wedding and meets hot guys and mean girls. All the characters in this book are spoiled, mean, brats with Louis Vuitton bags and money doesnt matter to them. Its too unrealistic and like Anna Percy said, ""are these bad lines from a trashy teen novel?""...or something like that.It tries to be like Gossip Girl and Sloppy Firsts but it doesnt succeed. I say, don't waste your time on this. Instead, try the ones I just compared with: Gossip Girl and Sloppy Firsts."
3,A so-so plot,"I bought this book because I was expecting it to be like those in the GOSSIP GIRL series (which I love). I was pretty disappointed with it. It's told from many characters' view points and sometimes this makes it a little difficult to follow. On the whole,I felt this book was simply ""pretty good."""
4,a-list review,"THE A-LISTAnna is a perfect girl. She gets perfect grades, goes to a perfect school and has a perfect life. When she flies off to LA to visit her extremely rich dad, she meets a guy named Jack on the plane. He invites her to his friend's wedding, which happens to be a famous movie star's. Follow Anna and Jack in this awesomely incredible book.I recommend this book to girls all ages. There is frequent adult language."
5,At the top of my A-List!,"I have read all the Gossip Girl books so far, and also such books as Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, and I think that The A-List is alot better than any of these. Anna is such a great character and it is east like her. It's like she's a rich girl but doesn't act like a rich girl. She has problems with her parents and with boys, and the guy that she likes the most just fell in love with her best friend. Then she moves from New York City to Beverly Hills, where the coolest girls in her new high school decide that they totally hate her. How they try to ruin her life is amazing to read. One bad thing after another happens to Anna, but she never gives in. What's also great about this book is that it is funny. I know that some other people here said how funny it is, but it really is. The book ends on a big question, so I just can't wait to buy the next one. Get yourself on the A-List by reading this book!"
5,"Gossip Girl, Move Over!","I loved this book so much. This book is just as funny as Gossip Girl and just as snarky, but somehow even more fun to read. I think it is because you will love the heroine Anna so much. She is a rich girl, but she could also be your friend very easily. She also is a girl who reads a lot. She moves from New York City to Beverly Hills, and the whole book takes place in just one day, on the day she arrives. There are hot guys and hot parties and you just want to keep reading to see what happens next. So if you love Gossip Girl books, you will adore The A-List. I laughed out loud many times when I read this, and I couldn't put it down."
2,"mediocre, at best","I picked up this book because it was recomended in the Gossip Girl series. I was, however, disappointed. The story is too slow-moving and the narrator was quite boring. I didn't like the style in which it was written, because it gave no depth or excitement to the story. I couldn't even get through the entire book, and had to stop midway. The A-List is one of those books that you have to keep putting down to go and do something else, otherwise your brain will explode from boredom. That's how I saw it, anyway. None of the characters were especially interesting, the plot pretty much reeked, and it moved. so. slowly. I definitley wasted my money on this book. (...)"
2,Not really A-list,"This book is supposed to be about a girl named Anna who moves in with her father in Los Angeles. There, she meets three snotty Beverly Hills girls(Sam, Dee, and Cammie) and a guy named Ben who could be The One. Sam, Dee, and Cammie are all in love with Ben, but Ben loves Anna.I personally did not like the book. I think the writer did not give the reader enough good reasons to love Anna. Unlike other books, I did not even care about the main character, Anna. I actually prefered Sam over her. But that's just me."
2,Don't Read,"Really, if you think about it how many more books do we need in this world about Paris Hilton-like girls that just take drugs and make out in their swimming pools. Please this topic has been done too much, and this book wasn't even good but I kept on reading. For the sole,purpose of finding out the turn of events, I'll buy the second book. :) This book is The O.C. on paper! *________*"
3,The B List,"I think the book was well written, but as soon as I finished it, I threw it at the wall, because I didn't want it to end that way!!Anna Percy is a rich girl from New York, and her best friend Cyn is like the perfect person to her. When she gets invited to go to Beverly Hills and stay with her dad, she hesitantly takes the chance. On the plane, she meets a guy Ben and after a hot session in the planes bathroom, he invites her to a wedding where she meets Dee,Sam,and Cammie. The 3 girls who all want Ben. This book is a great read, but I was disappointed with the ending."
3,ok plot with a bad ending,"I got this book because it was advertised as being similary to the acclaimed Gossip Girl Series. The main character in this book, Anna, is a lot less shallow than the girls in Gossip Girl. Unfortunatley, the ending ruins most of the story. After some ""page turneres"" the end does not leave you hanging, but instead one feels like they have wasted there time. if this book does well, the author left room for a sequel and hopefully the sequel will change Anna's decision in the end of this book and Anna will regret what she said in this book. I'm keeping my finger's crossed for a sequel with a better ending because the rest of this book was interesting..."
2,No Gossip Girl.,"If you're expecting another Gossip Girl, you most certainly won't find it in The A-list. The A-List bored me. All it was about was snobbish whiney brats. The Gossip Girls have class, and also the Gossip Girl novels explore many different people, not just those on the upper crust. The A-List also had no humor, while Gossip Girl has plenty."
2,Gossip Girl wannabe,"I read this book while waiting for the fifth gossip girl to come out, and it was pretty disappointing. it was very clearly a sad attempt to meet gossip girl's perfect combination of drama, humor and the occisional mention of a designer label. the author clobbers you with the labels, i felt like screaming ""just get to the point already!"" for example, instead of just saying, 'she grabbed her louis vuitton purse and ran down the stairs' it says 'she grabbed her brown louis vuitton purse, pulled her armani coat over her juicy shirt, slipped on her birkenstocks and ran down the stairs' it really takes away from the story. it doesnt compare to gossip girl"
3,Not on my A-list,"I read this after the Gossip Girl series, and after I finished reading the A-list, I didn't find it as biting as Gossip Girl. It didn't pull me in like I had expected it to. the A-list is a good book, it's fun and sexy, but the characters aren't as interesting. I wasn't crazy how they were all fighting over the same boy, I was sort of hoping it would be like Gossip Girl where they all have different stories going on at the same time. But whenever the book moved on to a different character, they were all thinking about the boy they liked. So it is a pretty good book, but i'm still deciding whether to move on in the series"
3,Very enjoyable but dosn't live up to 'Gossip Girls',"I just got through reading this book and I have to say, once you start, you won't put the book down till you finished!Summary:Anna, a high school senior from the east coast decided to 'change her life' and move in with her dad in LA to intern for a semester. On the plane ride there, she meets Ben who she feels is quite different from other guys. In LA, he then invites her to a wedding on new years eve and it all goes downhill from there when she meets LA's A-List.However, the character development isnt as extensive as Gossip Girls and the WHOLE book is during a period of about 4-5 days. Very fun read though!"
1,Dissapointment,"I was very excited when I purchased this book. After reading it however, I am still searching for the excitement. The book starts out at an okay pace, and never sped up with a central climax. The book fits right in with the sterotypical ""rich kids"" attitude.Overall, the books lacked substance."
2,Umm...,"I read this book over the summer, but quickly finished it and chucked it to the back of my closet. The A-List by Zoey Dean is pretty much a slightly less (but not by much) version of the Gossip girl series. The only reason I gave the A-List 2 stars is because it's better than the poorly written Gossip Girl books. Of course all the characters turn out to be trashy and unlikeable in this book too. Also, the story plot of this book was hardly original because everyone always writes about some girl who moves to Los Angeles. Basically, this book bored me. In the future, I'll read books with more substance and less trash. Let's just say I won't be reading any more novels by Zoey Dean or Cecily von Ziegesar for that matter."
3,"Reads Like a Reality TV Show, But Without the Reality","Like a repeat of Gossip Girl, but not as biting. Gossip Girl has superficial characters you don't care about, but at least they are entertaining gossip about. The A-List is like reading about an overexposed A-list celebrity on a reality TV Show, who hams it up on tv as though they're in a show. In other words, not very realistic teen fare. But not without redemption, this series will find an audience just like reality tv shows have."
5,selena is the best singer.,"i think selena is the best spainsh and english singer i ever heard. sincearlly, angie."
3,The Reader's Digest Condensed Version Was Better,"Thrilled by the 5-star Reader's Digest condensed version, I ordered the complete novel thinking that more Richard Hughes could only be better, right?Wrong.The condensed version completely eliminated the anticlimactic ending, well described by another reviewer here as ""In Hazard peters out like the storm it documents"" along with the utterly pointless death of one of the heroes, and it cut out a good deal of a nasty little subplot apparently designed to emphasize the dimwitted anti-Chinese racism of the British crew.What a disappointment."
5,A Must Have!,"This video should be viewed by everyone on the planet. The earth would be healthier. Without getting into the complexities of metaphysics, just know that water ""feels"" and picks up on our thoughts, energies and vibrations. Many have known this, now we have scientific proof. Considering that the earth and our bodies are mosty water, this is incredibly valuable information. We are now at the forefront of the science of energetic medicine; Dr. Oz and Dr. Deepak Chopra have addressed it frequently. Dr. Masaru Emoto should be nominated for a Nobel Prize for his discovery."
3,Water DVD,"A DVD documentary that was short, not too interesting & had a lot of subtitling. The book is much better & has more information!"
3,"cute, but the blue circles are difficult to work with","this is very cute, however, the blue dots which are the sticky stuff to hold the glass globes on are very difficult to work with. My eight year old stuck the stickers on and then I had to finish it off for her."
2,I don't think so....,"I am not impressed with these workouts. I am an avid exerciser, and have many workout dvds. These workouts are all very similar and not very challenging. They might be alright for a beginner, but I need something more challenging. I'm sending these back to Amazon ASAP."
4,Pretty Good,There are several DVDs with various workouts. So far I am enjoying the workouts. The workouts are not outstanding but they will work for building abs.
3,Just great,"Ok, I'm biased because I know some of the people in this book. But as a result, I can honestly say that this is a fascinating look at people with hearing losses who are genuinely happy and living life to the fullest. Enough said."
5,PERFECT,"fun fact: i have listened to this album everyday after school since i got it, probably more then the album (see my album reveiw)I like the contrast is the b-sides How Long is relatively slow with the odd fast momant and Did Ya Think has no slow momants at all basically the lyrics are about the same day/week in her life, waiting for someone to do something How Long is more depressed and Did Ya Think is more attituded and angsty and rougher but they both get the point across don't wait around for someone!! the lyrics are similar and i see why they don't fit on the album but they rockDid Ya Think is such a stand out in there catalogue, just buy the single for that!!love,KATY"
1,Download not the same as the album...,"The picture shows the cover for the veronicas 4ever single, but if you try to download it (or look at the picture when reviewing), it is actually the 4 Ever Remix Ep.The actual single (or other versions) has two B-Sides, ""How Long"" and ""Did Ya Think."" That is what I wanted and I know fans would rather have that too, as one reviewer reviewed this version, my quess being if you purchase it (used now) that's what you'll get.Unfortunately those prices are unreasonable or I'd purchase it.Amazon, please offer those two songs (or whole regular single) for download, as well the other veronicas singles such as Hook Me Up (again, 2 B-Sides), This Love (1 B-Side), and Untouched (1 B-Side)."

5,"TASTY ELECTRIC GUITAR ROCKIN"" BLUES & LOTS OF IT!!!","Similar to Robert Cray BUT WAY BETTER!! I like lots of electric rockin' blues guitar,I like JOHNNIE MARSHALL cuz thats what he gives ya, Good Voice Too! THIRTEEN Great songs on this one!!"
2,Great price lousy performance,I bought this thinking I would just need a basic stand to hold my motor. It turns out that this stand is very unstable being tall and not a wide stance at the base. First day of use the motor on the stand fell over and broke off the alternator mounts from the block essentially ruining this motor. If you have a small 4 cyl or a light weight motor it may work OK for you but I had a straight six and because of its long block it made the stand very top heavy and awkward to move around in time I have found ways to keep it upright but was very disapointed in general with this purchase except for price. Spend the extra money get the bigger stronger mount.
4,Super Book Club book!,"Monica Wood writes beautifully, and reading her book was delightful.She draws very clear characters and weaves their stories together smoothly.My book club read it, and we had one of our best ever discussions, coveringa wide range of topics, from different kinds of love to the Catholicchurch to children as witnesses to how people make the sacrifices theydo for each other. I strongly recommend Any Bitter Thing."
4,great story twist near end,"I have to admit that if this was not a book club pick, I probably would not have finished it. I felt like the story moved pretty slow. However, thankfully, I did finish it because there were a few suprising plot twists near the end that made the rest of the time spent reading well worth it."
5,What a Sweet Thing!,"What a Sweet Thing!I laughed, I cried, I thought about faith, hope and love.As in all Monica's beautiful works, there's a story here - a harsh and harrowing story of loss, and love, and good intentions that cartwheel out of control. There's also a tale here, a tale of the tragic human condition and the unforseen ways in which one can survive it.As these lines weave together, the beatified lives of a small girl and her priest uncle take shape. A terrible failure rings out in the night. All is changed. The jarred lives ricochet through time, haphazarding their way toward a surprise ending.As Monica's characters make their exit, bathed in the glow of their creator's compassion, I'm left to contemplate my own human condition."
4,Great Book...After The First 150 Pages...,"I am delighted that I ""stayed with"" this book, because I found it weighty, plodding and slow for quite awhile. It redeemed itself beautifully, though, in the last several chapters. Surprising, memorable, provocative and a really good choice for a book group (I'll be recommending it to mine!)."
3,Well...,"I'm torn on how to review this book. There were parts that were written so wonderfully that I wanted to read them out loud, but there were also parts that dragged on. The plot began as something beautiful, but I'm undecided on the turn it took."
3,OK read,"It was an OK read. It wasn't a page turner & I found it hard to stay interested, but it is beautifully written."
3,Painful story,"I enjoyed this book but I was not overwhelmed by it. I was mainly left with the notion that if you are guilty of anything, you are guilty of everything; well, at least you lose the right to defend yourself. Priests are simply human beings just like the rest of us. If it makes you feel better to elevate them to a position of someone who can speak to God ""for"" you you'll have to take what you can get. My father was a minister when I was a kid and this book made me think often of my childhood. What we need to remember is that it is only between you and God; you don't need a middle-man. You may enjoy your religion, but it not the same thing as faith."
3,No Comparison to The Secret Life of Bees,This book started out at a full gallop. I was so excited to be reading it. That feeling lasted about the first 170 pages and then it turned into a train wreck.The book attempts to pick up speed about the last 50 pages and I was glad I finished it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Very disappointing that such a promising beginning couldn't go the distance.
2,Kind of Dull.,This barely gets 2 stars basically because the album is quite boring. There are some classics such as Mtv Get Of the air. AND BOY THEY BETTER GET OFF NOW! Jock o Rama. Other than that quite boring. I have all the DK releases but this doesn't excite me.
5,To all the non-believers...,"As much flak as this album has recieved, it still is, in my opinion, the best DKs album.This album features eight of the best Dead Kennedys tracks ever: ""Soup is Good Food"", ""This Could Be Anywhere"", ""A Growing Boy Needs His Lunch"", ""Chicken Farm"", ""Jock-O-Rama"", ""MTV-Get Off The Air!"", ""At My Job"", and, perhaps the greatest DKs song ever, ""Stars and Stripes of Corruption"".""Stars and Stripes of Corruption"" is the greatest track off of this album, if only for the fact that it remains as relevant today as it did 20 years ago. All of the lyrics are as true today as they were yesterday, and that will probably the case for years to come.If you've only heard ""Fresh Fruit"", you owe it to yourself to check out this album, the best in the DK catalogue."
4,Excellent,"In my eyes, the Dead Kennedys kicked off political punk. Their assault on the way the United States runs and how there's corruption in office is definitely memorable. Even Jello's voice completely fits the style of music - shredding surf guitar with amazing drumming by Peligro.Although this album only has 10 tracks, every single track is entertaining and thought-provoking, which is more than you can say for most music out nowadays. My favorites would have to include ""Soup Is Good Food,"" and ""Stars and Stripes of Corruption."" Both tracks have excellent musicianship, as well as great points to back up their statements.Bottom line: if you like controversial music, and you like a good solid punk band, this album should be in your collection already. And if it isn't, get crackin'"
3,Dead Kennedys,"This CD is a long speech with a few songs. Jello does a good job with lyrics though and there are few songs that are good. If the guitarist and bassist raised the volume a tad it would improve this Cd a lot. The main upsides are the cover (one of funniest covers ever) and ""MTV-get off the air"" is cool. Get this CD if you like the Kennedys or just because Shriners in small cars is a funny cover."
1,Avoid ...,"A totally useless re-mastering of a classic album. The music gets FIVE STARS, but this horrible re-issue should get NONE. The sound is not better at ALL, but really considerably worse - now the record sounds like friggin' OFFSPRING or some such nonsense.Used copies are still out there bearing the ALTERNATIVE TENTACLES label logo - find those and buy one. Don't put a SINGLE RED PENNY into the pockets of the ex-Kennedys."
4,One of their strongest albums,"An excellent album with a strong mix of styles and moods, ranging from the hardcore of ""Dead Souls"" and ""Teresa, Give Me That Knife"" to the dark and moody ""Forget Your Life"" and ""Real Love."" The music is challenging at times but still delivers a lot of energy and is a great emotional release.Lyrically this album is fantastic and eminently quotable, e.g.: ""I couldn't remember my name / so I called myself Bob / it's weird being a Bob / but I'll get used to it, I HAVE TO!""Like many NoMeansNo albums the mixing leaves something to be desired - for example the drums are immersed in this annoying reverb that really detracts from the sound and performance. Not quite as bad as on 0+2=1 or Sex Mad though.For a better introduction to NoMeansNo I highly recommend Wrong which IMO is their strongest recording. But if you're looking for the next one to get, definitely get this one."
5,Pam C. Atlanta Ga.,"I read this book on the train to work everyday and would laugh out loud, I didn't want to stop reading when I got to my stop. It makes you want to have friendships like that. You can tell she wrote for Designing Women, I loved that show too. I have recommended this to my friends. Hope the next one is just as entertaining."
3,"Fine sense of place, way too much narrative","I felt this dying small town come alive, populated by a host of flawed characters shaped by a past filled with pride and prejudice. But I found the narrative weighty and the ending overly preachy."
3,Endearing characters but slow as molasses,"Well written and multi-layered, but that is the problem. There are so many characters you need to keep a list to remind yourself who's who and so many layers the book lost its punch. Hardly a page tuner, I finally starting skimming toward the end."
4,"Good, but....","Parts of this book made me laugh out loud, parts made me cry, and Jeter's poem and some of the words from his journals took my breath away. That said, I felt the novel was a little disjointed. I'd find myself getting into a character or situation, then -- bam! -- we're off to another character or story, and I'd be thinking, ""wait -- finish telling us about this, please!"" I also felt the novel could have used a couple more proofreads, since there were some grammatical errors. Overall I enjoyed the novel, but probably not enough to recommend it to my friend who always asks me what she should read next. It would make a good movie.(One minor rant: As the owner of an Austin Healey, I think any author who writes about one in a novel should first know how to spell it.)"
5,Thoroughly involving,"I loved this book! I truly hated for it to end. When I saw the author's name, I thought I'd probably like the book because I enjoy Southern fiction. No one knows the South and fewer write better than Thompson. I won't bother with a summary; others have done that already. Truth is stranger than fiction, and some of the reviews that I read mentioned that some of the characters' actions didn't ring true. I work with young people and nothing surprises me now.I loved Thompson's tv series', and I look forward to whatever she writes next. She is wonderful, talented, and observant."
3,Missed the mark,"I thought that the main story of Liberating Paris sounded interesting.Wood and Milan have been in a comfortable marriage for more than 20 years but it is put to the test when their daughter Elizabeth suddenly announces that she is engaged. Normally that would not have been a problem, but she is about to marry the son of the woman that Wood had never gotten over before he married Milan. Once she comes back into their lives, Wood starts up an affair that has consequences that he is forced to deal with.The problem I had with the book was the fact that this storyline was buried underneath a bunch of other plots going on with the local friends of Wood and Milan that had nothing to do with the problem they were facing with their marriage.As a woman who was a fan of Designing Woman, I really had high hopes for this book but was let down. If the author would just have stuck to the main story, Liberating Paris would have gotten a much higher rating."
1,Very disappointed . . .,"This text is vulgar and profane, and in my opinion, needlessly tasteful. The language is coarse and the some of the plot lines offensive. The author takes shots at religion, marriage, sex, fidelity, and the idea that a child should be raised in a two-parent home, with one parent being male and the other female. I was hoping for a humorous, enjoyable southern read; I didn't find it in ""Liberating Paris."""
5,comprehensive guide to a subsequent pregnancy,"Pregnancy after a loss is totally different to pregnancy before. After the naivete is gone, the bereaved parents are often fearful about having another baby; when they become pregnant, everyone assumes they have forgotten their lost little one and will concentrate only on the new pregnancy.This book examines head-on the mixed emotions of a subsequent pregnancy, offers guideines about knowing when your heart is ready to seek pregnancy again, and talks about many of the feelings a mother will have in being pregnant again after a loss. I found this book an invaluable resource. Read it once three months before you intend to conceive and then once again after you become pregnant. Highly recommended, although I'm sorry anyone would need to read this book in the first place."
3,Not for women who had a first trimester miscarriage,"I thought this book had a lot of good points, but it is geared more for couples who have lost their child during the late stages of pregnancy or shortly after birth. I had a miscarriage in my first trimester and this book was not really written for a loss so early into pregnancy.I do not regret buying this book because I did learn some things from it, but I would not recommend it for a couple that has experienced a early stage miscarriage."
3,Geometry Review,"I only started reading the book on Monday Feb 28, 2011.First, there apparently is no answer key for chapter 1 which is especially important to me since I am teaching myself geometry.Second, it took two weeks after date of shipping to actually receive the book. I'm concerned for the long delivery time.As I progress through the book, is there some place I can e-mail my qeustions to?ThanksChristine Daschriradou@juno.com"
4,Great book,"I homeschool my 12-year old son and it was difficult finding anything on line about poetry. This book covers couplets, triplets, quatrains, cinquains, haiku, limericks, shape poems and acrostics. It has plenty of template pages and we have both enjoyed working from this book. I wish I had reproduced the pages before we used them, as you could write different types of poems on each of the templates. I would highly recommend this book if you want to cover basic poetry."
1,NOT TAB HUNTER AT HIS VERY BEST!!,I'm afraid I don't agree with one of the reviewers who claimed that this is Tab Hunter at his best because not a single one of his hits is included in this album. When is Warner going to put out a greatest hits collection for this wonderful singer/actor?
5,rock & roll en espanol,wooow this cd is wooow for partys with the friends is very good songs from oldies i recomend this cd to haved brcause this songs dont comeback no more and hard to fine this kind cds on online ....... pretty good cd!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The best little opener I've ever had,"I love the Olfa Touch-knife! I think I have given it as a gift to everyone I know. I hate to say this because I don't want to jinx myself or cause anyone a hassle but I have gone through airport security many times and this little harmless circle never has gotten caught. I have one everywhere--even in the bathroom to open medicine and vitamin containers. I have one in the bedroom, my purse, my office desk...I can't think of any place where I haven't used one or haven't wished I had one there. I got so tired of running out because I was always giving them away when someone would admire mine, that I have bought several extra and am thinking about buying more. There are a few little things in life that are cheap and eternally helpful. This is one of them!"
2,Not His Best.,"I'm a big fan of Sandford and his Prey novels. As a Minnesota native I really enjoy traveling around the state with Davenport and seeing where I grow up. This novel took me away from that. Just in the first 30 pages you can tell that Sandford's New York trips are few and far in-between. His normal detail takes backseat to a poorly constructed dual plot. I really liked the Bekker character, but would have liked a little more focus on him instead of the Robin Hood killers. All in all I am sad to have wasted so much time on this book, but am looking forward to the next."
3,Not one of Sandford's best Efforts,"However, Silent Prey was still worth reading if you are on a plane or bus on a long trip. The capture of escapee Bekker and the Robin Hood killers, in my opinion, should not have been in the same story. Doing so made it difficult to follow and keep track of so many characters. It was still a decent book."
4,Good series...,"I had heard alot about the ""Prey"" series by John Sandford and decided to give them a try. I am reading them in order and this is the 4th book in the seris. It was a good read. I will continue on in the series. Next up - Winter Prey."
4,Very good read - again fast paced Davenport Mystern,Good buy. Intriguing twists and turns. Hard to put down. Finished in two days.
5,Did not disappoint,"I was so happy to receive this book. It came really fast. I am hooked on John Sanfords ""Prey"" books...he is one of my favorite authors. Very satisified with this book...did not disappoint. Would definitely recommend this book."
1,I tired easily from struggling through this verbose story .,"On and on and on it goes, where it stops.....who cares? very verbose story filled with so many characters it's hard to keep track. the longer I struggled with it, the more worn out I felt. At half point I skipped to the end to find out who had done it, said oh, ho hum and tossed it."
3,Not My Favorite of the Prey Books,"I don't want to start out by saying I was disappointed by this book in the ""Prey"" series, however, after ""Eyes of Prey"", reading ""Silent Prey"" was a bit of a let-down. The amount of characters was a bit confusing in the beginning (I couldn't tell who was going to be ""important"" and who was just a ""filler""). Also, the author seemed to jump around with the story line. Towards the end, the characters balanced themselves out and the story was wrapped up nicely. Having just discovered the ""Prey"" series, I will definitely continued to read along in order."
4,Gruesome but good,"I was looking for another crime series and I think I found it. I like Davenport. Seems like a believable character. Bekker makes my skin crawl. Luckily, the author does not go into excruciating detail every time Bekker takes a victim. The book takes a little time to rev up, but once it does, it is hard to put down."
3,Silent Prey,This 4th book started off good but as it went on some parts was interesting & some was boring. I'm happy I finished it because I wanted to see what happened to Bekker. Other than that this book was ok.
5,Silent Prey Lucas Davenport,I love all of Lucas Davenport's books. I have a hard time giving much information for his books because I love all of them.
4,John Sanford writes,I think I could be in love with Lucas davenport. I enjoy the clever plot twists and believable characters. Well worth the time & money
4,Each one becomes a favorite,"This book, my fifth of the series, impressed me. The adaptable Lucas taking on New York. The old nemesis, Bekker, up to no good again. As he attempts to fool the authories in a new way. His over drugging, if you would, continues his fury. A group of vigilante cops in NY add to the thriller, As Lucas has to dig deep to uncover all that is wrong. His womanizing contiues with an old flame and a new interest. The higher up corruption in the book add an interesting line. Overall a good read. I continue to be impressed with the series and am going to seek out a few more of the ""Prey"" series."
3,It's OK,"The music is OK. These guys are basically riding out the 15 mins. of fame that the Black Sabbath gig brought. But it wasnt Black Sabbath lets face it. I love heavy metal but sometimes people do it in a laughable manner. Cliche screams and ""spooky"" guitar riffs combined with rantings about death or satan can be quite silly as opposed to scary. Musicianship actually is quite well its the songwriting that lacks. Like I said, its OK."
2,cage review,If your a fan of black sabbaths album forbidden then this would be a good choice but if your more into albums like headless cross or eternal idol then stay the hell away from this!
2,Not entirely honest...,"The title of this book should be, ""Weight Loss Gimmicks That Could Be Miracles If You Had Unlimeted Time And Money"". Ms. Greenwood-Robinson presents these products as the answers to everyone's problems: just pop a pill and you're on your way to a healthy body. But she only briefly addresses the fact that in most of the research she cites, the subjects took doses that are probably just not feasible. For example, in her chapter on pyruvate, she mentions that the subjects in the research studies took doses in the range of 8-36 grams. Most pyruvate supplements come in doses of 500-750 MILLIGRAMS per tablet! So to supplement your diet with this stuff would cost you a LOT of money. Some of the supplements in this book would indeed be good additions to a healthy lifestyle, but if you're looking for an easy way out, this isn't it. Unfortunately, there's still no substitute for good old-fashioned exercise and a balanced diet."
2,Quick Reference Only,"This is NOT a ""book"" and in my opinion it should've been listed as a *pamphlet* not a ""paperback"". If you know your birds well enough (you wouldn't need this), it would make a decent quick-reference guide. But if you're looking for any detail (at all) about the species of birds in CT, their habits, diets, etc., then this is NOT for you. I do find it handy when I notice a new bird because it's easy to scan quickly, but for any informative detail, try elsewhere."
5,worth the wait,"I won't be coy and disguise myself here . . .I've been a colleague of Joe's for more than ten years, when he started writing The Snow Train. This book is his heart and soul, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it moved me immeasurably. To hear about a book for a decade, and then to finally read it -- and know that the rest of the world can now, too -- is probably something I'll never experience again. I want to use words like ""page-turning,"" ""tear-inducing,"" ""touching,"" ""emotionally charged"" and ""awesome,"" as all readers will, but the phrase that encapsulates my true feelings about The Snow Train is: ""as close to perfect as a first novel can get.""Way to go, Joe!"
2,Sure looks good,"Looks great, but accurancy is highly suspect. Pour your ingredients in, then tap the dish, it shoots up 3 or 4 ounces, so what are you measuring? Take the dish off and put it back on it goes way below what was originally measured out. So what is the deal? Do I have 8 ounces in here or not? I dont get it. I dont recommend if you are a real cook and just want to know how many ounces/grams you need for a dish."
2,not that interesting,"i'm a true ann rule fan, but this story did not have the spark that her other books have. i was a little disappointed."
4,Interesting to read the story behind the headlines,"Having lived in Seattle while ""Hollywood"" was plying his craft, it was very interesting to read who he and his friends really were.Scurlock wasn't a low life criminal-- he traveled the world, lived in an eclectic tree house, and basically thumbed his nose at the conventional work ethic."
3,Kevin Meyers Best Work Yet,"For never having met Scott, Ann Rule has done a good job capturing his considerable spirit, as misguided as it was. However, Scott would never have placed blame on his family for the choices he made in his life. It was extremely unfair of the author to do so.The author was totally suckered in by her main source of information. Scott's chosen line of work through the years was not as big a secret as we are led to believe. A lot of people knew about it, many more expected it (let's see, he has an endless supply of cash, likes to travel the world on a whim, but hasn't held a job since junior high school, hmmm), but virtually no one stepped in the breach to head off what was an inevitalbe outcome. Fact is, in our quiet lives, it's cool to know someone who walks on the wildside, especially when they have that kind of disposable income and and personal energy. Scott made his choices, bad as they were, and lived and died by them. The rest of us watched in a complicity of silence."
4,Another fascinating book by Ann Rule,"Another strong book by Ann Rule. The main story, ""End of the Dream,"" is fascinating and yet heartbreaking. A smart, talented, deeply loved man seems to assume that life owes him prosperity without effort. He manipulates those who love him to commit atrocious deeds to keep him in the lifestyle he thinks he deserves. The four stories that follow the main one are less gripping, perhaps because they are much shorter and lack the details that makes the longer story so engrossing."
1,Book is Full of Misinformation,"Ms. Rule's book is full of misinformation. I knew Scott for many years and thought of him as a brother. I am friend of the men who are in prision. As a former journalist, I am surprised that Rule can call her book a ""true"" crime story. She put quotation marks around people's statements whom she never spoke with and I know this for a fact! This book is causing further injury to friends and family who have already been hurt by this tragedy. Kevin Meyers, one of Rule's main sources of information, is not the most reliable character. A couple of her other sources misrepresented themselves as ""friends"" of Scott, Kevin and Mark. I sense that they are either trying to cleanse their own guilt,trying to make a fast buck, or reach for their 30 seconds of fame. In the meantime Rule and others line their pockets with cash from the death of my friend. To me their acts are a type of ""robbery."""
1,"DON""T BOTHER","Pathetic.....nothing more than National Enquirer garb.How much did these maggots make giving information onpeople they ""thought"" they knew? tsk tsk...."
1,Ann Rule forgot to do her research on the book!,"I was shocked when I read Rule's book. She apparently believed Kevin Meyers' story - hook, line and sinker! Anyone who knows Kevin (and I do) can tell you that he has misrepresented himself and Scurlock and the Scurlock family. I am appalled that Ann Rule did not take the time to substantiate any of his stories. I am dismayed at the way she has portrayed the Scurlock family. They are some of the most wonderful and caring people in this world. I think she owes them an apology! Also, the fact that she would present and claim that Kevin Meyer's story is fact, makes me wonder about her integrity. She has also gotten some of her crime facts wrong. I have personally read all of the official police reports and there is definitely differing evidence. This would be okay except she is presenting this book as fact. Anyone who reads this book should be aware of all of this."
3,A Big Change,"Ann Rule is one of my favorite authors, and I've avidly read all of her books. This is quite a change compared to her other books. Most of the book is spent in getting to know the boy who never grew up. The crime is nearly secondary. I enjoy the change in venue & look forward to her next book, too."
5,Ann Rule At Her Best,Ann Rule has created the perfect true crime art form. She takes a local crime-one that most readers have never heard of-and creates a book that must be read in one sitting.(I couldn't put it down) She always brings to the forefront the details of the main characters and how they intertwine. She does her homework and adds facinating details. This is a story of how one man with brilliant potential can go bad and how he enticed others into abetting his lifetime of crime.
3,Where is the Rest of the Story????????,"I enjoyed this book very much, although I'm left with many questions that will probably never get answered. Kevin Myers sounds like a very intellegent man and it seems to me that he is trying to deceive the readers with his so-called ""innocence"". I have a difficult time believing that Scott Scurlock hid his ""secret life"" from his CLOSE circle of friends. Kevin Myers seems to be praising himself though-out the whole story and it left me feeling like I had been taken advantage of."
5,Ann did her homework as usual!!!,This book is well written and amazing how the author compiled all the statements and evidence to give us a day by day account.
1,End of the Dream by Ann Rule,Apparently this item got lost and a refund was issued to me. I would still like to buy this book.
5,The End of the Dream The Golden Boy Who Never Grew Up,The book arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. I would recommend this seller.
2,No No NO!,"I love Ann Rule and her suspenseful TC thrillers, but this book i could not finish. It just kept repeating it's self. Ann Rule you can write better than this! I see that there is a subheading that says"" The Golden Boy who never grew-up,"" this is the true focus of the story....a man his friend a tree house and being un-clothed. That is the highlight of the story. I think Ann Rule lacked info about the situation therefore the book was very bland. I liked her other novels: You Belonged to Me, Heartful of Lies, Every Breath You Take, In the Name of Love, Small Sacrifices. Do not read the Green river Murder TC by her it was very bland like this book!"
5,Breathtaking Classic!,"Riefenstahl's triumphant masterpiece celebrating the human body, the spirit of competition and the appreciation of beauty. Vividly depicted, perfectly captured in splendid, groundbreaking photography. Arguably her best work and a timeless joy to watch again and again."
1,A Masterpiece Reduced to Junk,"Timeless Video should be ashamed of itself, putting out such a poor version of this classic documentary film. Another reviewer notes it has been ""tampered"" with; long sequences apparently have been removed for some reason and the visual quality of what's left is very poor overall. I was not bored by this film, as was another reviewer, because I couldn't watch it for very long. Do not buy it."
1,Not at all what I expected...,"This item was labeled as ""One size fits all"" and I am on the curvy side and it was huge with no way to tighten it without making it look extra funky. The red crushed velvet cape was probably the nicest part of the whole costume but it really did not look very pirate-ish. The laces in the cheaply made corset were pretty much pointless and I felt like if I tried to tighten them anymore they would have torn right through the material. I repackaged it up and returned it right away. (I put together a much more realistic pirate costume by going to the local thrift stores and finding a striped shirt and cheap pants to cut up as well as lots of fun accessories for less than half the price of this costume.)"
3,not her best but what's good is great,"This isn't Gillian's best work. ""Hell Among the Yearlings"" was better, and ""Revival"" was the best. Hope this isn't a trend. But there are moments in ""Revalator"" that sparkle. Just getting to hear Gillian sing ""Red Clay Halo"" is worth the price of the disc. So I'll keep listening and hoping for more songs like ""Red Clay Halo."""
3,don't believe the hype,"Gillian and Dave were on a roll for a couple of albums and could have done country music a great service with their third release if they hadn't tried so hard. Coming off of the attention they received for their O Brother Where Art Thou contributions, I was hoping to see them deliver a death blow to the Shania Twains and Tim McGraws that dare to call themselves country. But instead, they put out a so-so album of new songs and then others that I've heard them play live over the years and then some concept ""Ruination Day"" garbage that doesn't fly. Where as previous albums may have gone too far in content and style to sound like authentic Appalachian music, Gillian and Dave switched gears for Time and I think their transmission fell out on Highway 61. Anyway, if you want a good/great Gillian Welch album get Hell Among the Yearlings or Revival."
3,"OK, but ...","If you're looking for a Gillian Welch album to begin with, I would recommend ""Revival."" Revival was the first album of hers I'd got, and I was ecstatic after giving it a listen. (See my enthusiastic review on amazon.) Naturally, I couldn't wait for more, so moved on to Time.""Time"" may be the revelator, but it's also a letdown. The album is just tooooooooo sloooooooooow. So much so that at times it plods. Painfully along. Note ... by ... note.I don't know what it is. Her voice is still there, good as ever, but it lacks heart and soul. Which can't be injected into a song just by slowing it down. Notable exceptions include ""Red Clay Halo"" (my favorite) and ""I Want to Sing that Rock and Roll."" And the title track, ""Revelator,"" though slow, still has something special to it.Unfortunately, it looks like I'll be a one-disc Gillian fan. I'm reluctant to try Hell Among the Yearlings or her newest one, based on my disappointment with Time."
2,Too much hype,"This is a good album but it's not the best thing ever, the way people are talking about it. Modern country western fans don't get much good songwriting on the radio, but if you listen to superb songwriting from the gut of indie songwriters all the time, Time (The Revelator) doesn't seem that special.I recommend this to fans of Mazzy Star, Lucinda Williams, NPR background music and anyone on Valium."
4,Gillian Welch - The Revelator,"bought this because i heard a clip on bbc2. best purchase i have made in a long while. the songs are soothing, foot-tapping and easy to learn. brilliant for listening to on long car journeys, relaxing, or back ground music whilst entertaining. Gillians voice is fantastic as is her partner in crime - david rawlings. what a team. Elvis Presley blues must now be one of my all time favourite songs."
5,"""I was thinking that night about Elvis, then he died.""","Time (The Revelator) is a wonderful, mournful and honest thing. It gets better and better with every listening. Contrary to the Amazon review, I think that I Want to Sing That Rock and Roll is the weakest track, its light-hearted upbeat tone is out of place with the rest of the deadpan songs. But every other track is dead on. It's all sad. Gillian's gift is to say things in a simple way, the songs have a mean gravity. Singing about Elvis, she describes him as an ambiguous gendered creature, ""he shook it like a chorus girl, he shook it like a Harlem queen."" It's really vague, almost trailer trash, but it is powerfull. ""I could get a tip jar, gas up the car."" Honesty is a rare thing, a real treasure. Thank you Miss Welch."
4,Revelatory,"Gillian Welch's third release is an eclectic assembly of unique melodies and pure folk joy. ""Dear Someone"" has the lush, ethereal quality of ""Paper Wings"", with a drawn-out lullaby melody where Welch's and Rawling's voices blend seamslessly. ""Red Clay Halo"" is a full-out, toe-tapping hill folk song. My favorite, ""I Want To Sing That Rock and Roll"" is a nostalgic trip back to the Guthrie/P,P&M type of sing-along, feel-good song, full of Rawling's guitar virtuosity. And ""Elvis Presley Blues"" is a must-hear, bluesy tune with clever lyrics that really showcases the depth of Welch's voice. Rawlings is an ideal musical complement to Welch and she works with him to her best advantage on this album. The quality of the songs here is consistent and gives us a hint of Welch's true range as a singer and instrumentalist."
4,Best Album Yet,"Gillian's first two albums contain songs that I like better than anything on ""Time"" (such as ""One More Dollar"" or ""Acony Bell""), but taken as a whole, this is her best album yet. This one was produced by David Rawlings (Gillian's brilliant side-kick), and as a result, the album has a more undilluted appeal. It is hard to quantify, but the songs and performances on ""Time"" seem to benefit from not being filtered through the sensibilities of T Bone Burnett (the producer of her first two long players). The mood is lilting and slightly somber, but the mood never becomes as foreboding as ""Hell Among the Yearlings"". The album even offers a rare glimpse into Gillian's sense of humor (see ""Elvis Presley Blues"").None of Gillian's individual albums has been a masterpiece, but if she continues to produce albums of this calibre I will be everlastingly enchanted......and that dress is beautiful."
1,Hillbilly music - Not that I do not like some music in this gender,"Kind of depressing as a whole and no real good or catchy songs, personally I have a hard time finding much of anything really good to say about anything about the album."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about Gillian Welch. On one hand, I applaud her for sort of carrying the banner of traditional American music and showing that it's still vital and relevant today. On the other, something about her seems forced and contrived. Plenty of artists mine material, styles, or artistic forms from eras historically distant from themselves - some do so ironically (the annoying craze for all things ""retro""), while others present the material straightforwardly, from a repertory/revival standpoint. Artists that succeed by doing neither are able to integrate the traditional with their own sensibility and perspective, and I think it's here that Welch is lacking. She has a wonderful voice, but to me she tries too hard to be the Depression era, Carter-familyish woman singer with the home-spun dress."
5,"Yes, it's a real 5","I guess you have to start with the songwriting. Melding Elvis with the John Henry legend just works so well here. It becomes a bit cryptic on ""April 14th - Part 1"" but I think it's a song about a connection to that very dark vein in early American music that has such a hold on her. The Titanic sinking, the Oklahoma bombing and Lincoln's assassination all occurred within a few days of April 14th. David Rawlings is simply a perfect accompaniast. He contributes backing vocals sparingly and plays a precise guitar that reminds me of Norman Blake. It just seems that Gillian Welch understands a tragic sense in the heart of America and it's there for anyone willing to spend a little time to listen."
5,BikerBarRadio.com Gives 2 Thumbs/ 2 Toes UP! to Gillian,"I will let others give you the details of why this is a wonderful CD. It certainly is and they are 100% right!What I can tell you is that to my ear ( and I think I have a good ear for music ) this is an amazing addition to Gillian's previous 2 CD output without a filler song!!This CD was playing on BikerBarRadio.com about 30 mins after it was out.... and will continue playing for some time!The title track has a quality about it... is hard to put into words... The final track "" I dream a HighWay "" while long...certainly could bring a tear to this biker's eye...I still need to figure out my internal reaction to this particular song. Like the old zen riddle of NOroad/NObike/NObiker/...BUY! it NOW!! don't delay.... don't think...just DO IT!Michael"
2,Red Clay Halo is great!,"I was disappointed in most of the tracks, but Red Clay Halo is worth the cost of the disc."
3,Disappointment on first hearing,"I first heard of this album on NPR and liked what I heard. The excellent reviews on Amazon also convinced me. On first hearing, the songs were good, but the dissonant accompaniment by the guitar detracted considerably, getting in the way of the song. Songs this good do not need ""improvisation"" in the accompaniment. Sort of like trying to listen to a good song, well sung, while someone in the background was scraping a blackboard with his or her fingernails. Perhaps I'll change my mind on repeated hearings. I hope so."
2,average,this album doesn't keep me. I felt no excitement. I listened a couple times and then gave it away.
3,A one song cd,"On first listen, I found myself quite disappointed in this CD, UNTIL I got to the last track, I DREAM A HIGHWAY. For those of you familiar with Dylan, I DREAM A HIGHWAY is Gillian Welch's DESOLATION ROW. It has the same haunting, melancholy tone, and like DESOLATION ROW with Dylan's HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED, it takes up about a third of the CD (over 14 minutes)--which is good, because the rest of the tracks aren't really worth listening to. I DREAM A HIGHWAY is the masterpiece so far of Welch's young career, but, if you're like me, you'll probably find yourself skipping through the rest of the songs on the CD to get to it."
2,Insipid and Tedious,"One of the problems in relying upon listener reviews is that most of them are written by die-hard fans, who would fawn over the sound of a motorcycle if they thought their hero was riding it. Relying upon my enjoyment of the ""O Brother"" soundtrack and after reading several of the positive reviews here, I bought this disk and was immediately disappointed. To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, Gillian Welch is no Emmylou Harris. Worse, each of the songs sounds like all of the others. As she mumbled her way through each one, I kept thinking that the next would be better, but no luck. Unless you are one of her established fans, skip this one. In fact, skip Gillian altogether."
1,The Great Depression,"This album is my biggest disappointment of 2001. I have nothing to say in commendation. It is monotonous and requires hard work just to listen all the way through. It is the most depressing set of music I've heard in years, absolutely no redeeming value....Buyer beware...;download a file or two before putting your money at risk. Mine's already on the used CD market."
4,"She's pretty and emotionally intelligent, which is rare","Besides being beautiful, Gillian Welch has a sweetness and authenticity that is beyond her years. She's almost as good as the pioneers of '60s folk like Joni Mitchell, Mama Cass Elliot, Joan Baez, Mary Travers, Vashti Bunyan and a couple others.I will be purchasing this album, because it's encouraging to see a young girl singer channelling country greats like Loretta Lynn and injecting folk and rock influences like Grace Slick into the mix. This is a powerful, new album in an age of stagnancy and decay. Bonus points for no synthesizers, fake drums, sampling or voice correction software."
5,Infinitely hilarious,"Welch and Rawlings have produced one of the best comedy albums of the century. A must-listen for lovers of Nichols and May, Stiller and Meara, etc."
4,"They Call The Wind ""Miranda""","This local novel (as I live in Connecticut) was published in 1969 based on murder trial(s) that took place in 1966 and 1967. The victim was a housewife and mother with her mother-in-law living in her home. The accused murderer was the son of a family friend . This book is not so much about the actual murder, but an indictment on the investigative methods of the over-zealous police to pin the murder on the accused. Mix this with some serious in-house politics and you have a legit page-turner.The author actually attended the trial(s) and the testimony is verbatim. If you ever wondered what type of circumstances might have brought on the ""Miranda"" ruling (which took place in 1966) this book clearly illustrates why the accused rights needed to be undersood by the individual. I enjoyed it, and I hope you do as well."
2,Not my favorite Bradden,"I love the late Victorian Sensationalist genre. The best known author from that school is Wilkie Collins but it also includes Margaret Oliphant, Ellen Woods, & Mary Bradden. I've read other of Braddon's books and enjoyed them but this former actress turned writer left me a bit lost with her first book.....and this was supposedly a re-working from her original book. She threw in every plot device she could think of which made for confusion. There were some fun parts but also dull, rambling passages that seemed to go on and on. Serpent was my least favorite books of '09 (as of March, 2009)."
3,Wander elsewhere,"Solo piano with instrumental accompaniments. Well produced and played but only one memorable track - ""Oceans Cry""."
3,"Good product, poor packaging",Item received was slightly broken from poor packaging or from carelessness from UPS (don't know which).Overall happy with item as I use it to store cards and think this product is one of the better protector of cards.
1,NOT IBM PRODUCT,"These are Ultrium LTO 3 tapes made by Tandberg. The item description and picture show IBM Tape and and IBM product number, but that it not what they ship. Beware."
3,Just OK,"""The Spanish Apartment"" follows Xavier, a French student who decides to improve his chance of getting a job in finance by studying a year in Spain. He leaves behind his girlfriend, but soon finds consolation in his fun roommates and somewhere else (I don't want to give too much away). The characters feel real, and that is one of the merits of the movie. The actors are also quite good. But the screenplay is never engaging enough to make us care much about Xavier."
4,"Clever, Charming, Fun!","A great fun, creative film! A very light hearted look at modern coming of age as exchange students learn that there are no rules when studying abroad. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll punctuate some more dramatic themes such as love, fidelity, loyalty and betrayal. Throw 6 students studying in Barcelona from 6 different countries together in an apartment and see what unfolds! Clever filming and and camera motion as well as a bohemian undertone make this a very enjoyable film."
5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie!","This is one of my favorite movies. The characters are funny and real, the languages are beautiful...BUY IT!!!"
4,The Spanish Apartment,"I loved this film! Entertaining, colorful, lighthearted, and adventurous. This was a pleasant film to watch and while no deeper meanings of life were revealed it was a fun way to spend an evening."
4,L'Auberge Espagnole (The Spanish Apartment),I was pleasantly suprised by L'Auberge Espagnole (The Spanish Apartment). Watch it and enjoy! Four stars!
3,DVD version not as good as the movie,"I saw this movie in the theaters and although I enjoyed pretty much the whole thing, my favorite parts were the ones with the english brother (played by Kevin Bishop). That's what made me want to to buy this movie (as opposed to just renting it). I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that the DVD version cut out some of these funny parts. There were 3 scenes that were really funny - all of them were shortened on the DVD version (did Steven Spielberg edit this?)If you could care less about the parts with Wendy's brother (Kevin Bishop), by all means get this movie. If you like these parts, then I would NOT Recommend buying this DVD(rent it instead)."
1,Unbelieble bluff,"I read some good reviews about this movie. In adition, I respect french's cinema, they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies. So, I bought ""Spanish Apartment"".A big dissapointment. Hughe one.It's candid, it's ""naive"", it's boring, with poor ideas, poor acting, very predictable. There's a lot of good movies around you, don't waste your time in this one."
1,Why is this here?,"This is an Audrey Tautou film, not a Marion Cotillard film. Cotillard is not listed in the full cast list. Could someone explain?"
3,"An International ""Real World""/Coming of Age Film","I enjoyed this film- it was fast-paced, had interesting characters, and gave a unique twist to what could have been a stale/over-used plot. The main character's decision to live abroad for a year was less than adequately clear, as was his age intially.I particularly enjoyed the various trials and tribulations of Xavier's roomates- the interesting/quirky characters thrown into the mix added a lot of humor and interest to this film."
4,Not much of Audrey Tautou,I loved this movie... it captures the essence of what it's like to live abroad and what it's like to move back home. It shows all the changes a student goes through when leaving all the comforts of home. Audrey Tautou's role is quite small though so don't buy it just to see her- or you'll be disappointed. Still a great film though!
5,For everyone who has ever studied abroad!,"I saw this film last year while studying in Paris and it is incredible! I saw about 80 foreign films last year and this one is by far the best. If you have ever studied abroad before, this is a movie you HAVE to see. It completely captures the experience, and is absolutley HILARIOUS.I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since May!"
1,Horrible Experience,"Don't like the product. I would get into more detail, but I am afraid of a second round of harassing emails from this company.Other products they sell I will buy and think are great. However, don't you dare review anything poor, or they will make you suffer until you remove your thoughts."
2,I thought this book was a waste of time,"Maybe if you're an architect looking for inspiration for cabins or 2nd homes, this is worthwhile... but that's not what I expected. I was hoping for a book that would actually give me some good designs for cabins.This is a 250 page oversize book with lots of photos. That's good. But out of all those pages and photos there were only 2 cabins that impressed me at all, the rest are downright ugly, impractical, and useless. And most of them also look very expensive to build.It seems to me that this book is more about ""2nd homes"" than cabins.I think the bottom line is that this book is oriented more towards architects trying to get inspired by new ideas for 2nd home designs.If you're looking for a book that will give you usable designs and info on building a cabin, this is not it."
3,The Cabin is Allegorical,This book is by a childhood dreamer and also someone who needs to know how Cabins were lived in 150 yrs. ago.
4,Lovely and inspiring,This is such a lovely book to look at. Turning the pages is a pleasure for us. We are looking for second home ideas and plan to buy or build a home next year. My favorite book on the subject is called SECOND HOME because it also is lovely and inspiring but it offers much more information than this CABIN book. Both books are gorgeous but SECOND HOME blends that beauty with helpful tips we are using to plan our own place.
3,Very dreamy but I need more help,"Getting away has taken on a certain urgency in the past week. The second home we've been wanting now seems like a good idea for our primary residence, instead. Getting our family of the metro area is something we are seriously considering. Books that help include:SECOND HOME (shows great houses around the country but also includes real estate shopping information, tips on evaluating a region or a small town, and so forth. inspiring and helpful too. houses includes new homes as well as refurbished older ones. A handsome but realistic book.)CABIN FEVER (a style book that does show how delightful a small cabin can be)SMALL HOUSE BIG STYLE (a very helpful book that also shows how to live in smaller spaces)NEW COTTAGE HOME (interesting smaller cottages -- they look mostly architect designed -- lots of good ideas if you plan to have a house built)"
4,Beautiful Book,"This is the perfect companion to my dreams of a cabin of my own. Wide variety of styles, sizes, budgets. While most are in northern climates, there is one lovely Louisiana ""dog-trot"" cabin featured. A beautiful book -- I flip through it often."
1,"I thought it was going to be garden fresh-centric, but...","This book was a real disappointment. I thought I was going to get something akin to ""My Calabria"" and I got something more like ""Joy of Cooking."""
2,runs small,The look of the hat is nice but they need to list what size the hat fits. After buying this I realized this style of hat runs small so order bigger than you would normally wear
3,A Fun & Fluff 'B' Movie Which Zips Along,"With a title like that, I expected a very dumb movie, but it wasn't bad.....actually decent. It's a harmless cop-fantasy film with police drama mixed in with some humor and special effects.I found a lot more drama than humor, which surprised me, although there were a few funny lines by the ""gnome,"" a special- effects creation of Stan Winston.Despite a film filled with angry characters - cops and crooks - the language was pretty tame and the film moves well and zips by since it's only 84 minutes. Yes, the story is ludicrous and some of the dialog is B-movie, but it was pretty enjoyable.Sorry to see this unavailable in any form. Boy, if I had known that, I would have kept my VHS copy."
4,Pc bag,I like it because it fits the purpose of transporting my new laptop. No problems with the purchase and enjoying it.
3,Very Basic,It does what you need it to do. The description and some reviews led me to think it had more room than it does.
3,Laptop tote,"Hardly any padding for protection. Barely fits a 15.6"" laptop and cooling station stand with no extra room next to it. It does have a front compartment but you can only put flat items in it like files if you don't want to risk anything getting broken. No padding in front compartment. Couldn't fit my charger next to the computer or my mouse. Put the charger in the front flap and it bulked out. Was afraid it could break. For $23.00 more at ebags I got a laptop briefcase that holds my laptop, cooling station stand, charger and mouse. I was able to strap down my laptop in the sleeve & with enough room for the mouse to sit next to it and it came with a bag to hold the charger which fit next to the laptop. Plus storage in the top for pens, files, cell phone, ect... Plus you can lock it with your own combination. So for $44.00 including the shipping which this item was 60% off I can carry everything I need plus room for 2 IPads and more and extra protection."
1,Very Dissatisfied!,I was never able to use the bag. On the first attempt it just fell off from shoulder and slight burst. It was simply a waste of money. Was very disappointed with purchase. Bag is very heavy.
3,good deal,"I think its a fair deal,The zippper is not that good ...everything else is ok(especially the price) but not great"
5,great for the price,Great case for the price. It was a gift and she loved it. I liked it because it wasn't to expensive and yet had space for everything she needed.
5,Good enough,"For the price paid, this is a good enough product, I will recommend it who wants to carry his computer"
2,PC Treasures,Very dissatisfied with the quality of the workmanship of this product. Purchased 4 of these bags & the sewing immediately started falling apart.
4,"Amusing, worth a look.","An amusing farce with Jim Belushi in a role that highlights his ample comic abilities. An all-around enjoyable movie, definitely worth a look."
4,Alternate title,"This movie was shown in theaters under the title ""Filofax,"" the brand name of the 6-ring planner that was involved."
4,Best Waste of a Sunday Afternoon,"The statement, ""He wins a couple of baseball tickets by calling a radio quiz show,"" misleads the viewer from the best part about this film. He wins Cubs World Series tickets! Therefore, this should be a must see for any Cubs fan! There is also a cameo by one of the Cubs' greats and, not suprisingly, he has a major impact on the film. If there is a better movie about a guy breaking out of prison to see the Cubs in the World Series...I haven't seen it."
2,average film,this film had a few laughs but it never really got working for me.James Belushi always seems to get the sidekick role even in films where He is the Main star.it is a very cliched type of film but it has some moments.
1,Very disappointing DVD of a great film.,"I truly like this film. It is funny all the way through, and James Belushi is the perfect foil for uptight yuppie Charles Grodin. However, I am sorry I bought the DVD. First of all, it's not in widescreen. Second, it has zero features. No trailer, no production notes, no cast notes. Nothing. There is of course better picture quality than the VHS edition, but there is not one other thing to recommend it. It would be different if this was a budget title, but it's a $20 DVD!... Buy this only if you can't find a VHS copy."
1,Taking Care of Business,"I was disappointed because I received a copy of this movie which was foreign. Our VCR could not read the movie, so we were unable to watch it. I love this movie and was anxious to share it with my Mom & Sister. I did receive a refund, however."
1,Needs More Grace,"A desperate, lame, unimaginative, fish-out-of-water farce that consistently goes for cheap laughs and cheap titillation. The most imaginative part of the movie was the Cubs winning the World Series, since imaginary Fall Classics are the only kind the Cubbies are participating in these days. Consequently, my favorite part was the World Series game with Mark Grace's cameo. Indeed, the whole movie could have used more grace. Rated R for language, some thematic aspects and the titillation mentioned above."
5,The Reverend is still alive.,"Andy shows, in this album, the mastery of the sound of Reverend Gary Davis. I can see the Reverend smiling wherever he is whenever Andy plays the music of Reverend Gary Davis. You also may want to check out the CD The Music Of Reverend Gary Davis by various musicians including the late Dave Van Ronk."
4,Easy Introduction to commonly asked questions.,"This book is a concise, easy to read introduction to commonly asked questions on Christianity."
5,Favorite,"This is the favorite Ewe Know story, that gets played over and over. It involves a birthday party, and the lamb's reactions to the gifts that they receive."
5,"A beautifully told folktale, with lovely illustrations","In this retelling of this magical Scottish folktale, Mordicai Gerstein and Susan Cooper tell of the Selkie (maiden of the sea) who is compelled to live among mortals. When Donallan sees a beautiful naked selkie on the rocks, he falls in love with her and steals her sealskin so she can no longer live in the sea. He marries her, and she bears him five children. But she longs for her sea home and family. At last she finds her skin, and is able to return to the sea. This lovely book will appeal to all ages - 3-adult. A Publishers Weekly review said of it, ""The lyrical text weaves a tale of sweeping dimension; this is storytelling at its finest. Particularly lovely are Hutton's sensitive and muted watercolors."""
2,New Values oppose the abduction and rape of woman,"This story is no longer suitable for young children.It is the story of a rape and subjugation of a woman (seal) by a man. These are no longer considered values that should be encouraged. Older children might discuss how those values were true at one time in the past but now men who abduct and force women into marriage are rapists. For more about this point of view please read the following article.[...]Why Are 8 Year-Olds Reading Stories That Glorify Rape?""After her 2nd grader was assigned a story that glorifies rape and extols whiteness as the standard for beauty, a mother tackles bias in elementary school literature head on.""by Jennifer HolladayI am giving it 2 stars because it is an interesting story and has roots in the way people once thought... but who among us would want our daughters kidnapped and forced into marriage?"
1,Do Not Buy This.....POOR Quality DVD-R,This is not a studio released copy it is a DVD-R with a sticker type label.I have no clue how this got on Amazon since I have always known them to be a reputable company that do not sell questionable material.The quality is bad and the dialog sound to actual mouth movements sync is way off.I am going to return it.
1,BOOTLEGGING AT ITS FINEST!,"AS SOON AS I OPENED THE PACKAGE, I KNEW THIS DVD WAS A BOOTLEG COPY. EVEN THE RE-PRINTED COVER WAS AWFUL! AMAZON, YOU SHOULD BE MORE DISCRIMINATING...."
1,"Unauthorized, illegal release",This release of Attack of the Monsters (Gamera vs. Guiron) is unauthorized and illegal. Buy the much higher quality version when it's out this September from Shout! Factory. Don't support movie pirates.
3,mexican blob,"this film could have had more blob action, especially in 1st blob scene, in the cave, b/4 killin off this 1st person so easily; could a been a longer film, not so dark & nonsharp lookin. goog orig. film.forget the 2nd film-non sharp vid. quality & they edit the 1 extra min. which is the best part of the film-when knife monster really finishes spacegoas off-only thin left was a body w/ 1 leg-hilarious."
1,Don`t waste your money,"I had a chance to read this book a while ago. I never got to finish it because I feel asleep twice from boredom!!! I am the type of person that can stay up all night to finish a book .I never got curious or stimulated by this boring, shallow book about nothing!!Do not waste your money!My grandmother life stories are more interesting that the story of those people in the book.It talks about five young people with the everyday struggles to reach the goal to became pilot. this book goes on and on without a point or a something to teach other tham what we all already know ..In life we have to work hard for what we really wantHello!! We alredy know that free of charge.."
3,Second Son,"MY LORD JOHN by Georgette Heyer is a historical that she had long planned, but never got to complete. Her plans were for a three-part story, but her death precluded her ambition. Outside her mysteries and Regency romances this departure was never more than a work-in-progress that ends in the middle of a sentence.The early story of John, Duke of Bedford the grandson of John of Gault, second son of Henry IV and nephew to Henry V is a historian's dream for research, but little more than a historical footnote.This is one volume for which there is little middle ground. It is either enjoyed for its insight into the period of the close of the Plantagenet reign in England or disdain for its obvious incompleteness.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and TRAVELERS."
1,turgid and incomprehensible,"My Lord John - a real disappointment - the book is so steeped in geneological detail on almost every page that it is almost incomprehensible - the main thrust of the story is lost, and the characters become confusing and uninteresting.Definitely not one of the best of Heyer's work. The book is also unfinished, ending in the moddle of a sentence!I would NOT recommend this book."
5,Ficitonal History,"Usually we think of the Duke as an evil person because of Joan of Arc, but that is a false image as her execution was ordered by the church not the Duke. It is a shame that Georgette Heyer did not get to finish the book. The life of the Duke after the death of his brother, Henry the V, would have been interesting."
2,Just not what I expected,"Heyer's books are treasures - filled with witty dialogue and sympathetic characters. Having enjoyed so many of her books, I ordered this one thinking it would be interesting to read something about a different period. While I can't say I was totally disappointed, this is not your usual Heyer story. It is really her version of the history of the period centered around an interesting and quite ""noble"" character. I missed the usual elements of romance, misunderstandings and reconcilation. Her Georgian stories remain my personal favorites. Not bad - just don't expect her usual approach."
3,Copy-protected???,"Not that I can tell. I guess it pays to have a mac. I had no problems putting this CD into iTunes and then onto my iPod. Oh, the music itself is pretty forgetable."
2,A minor dissappointment,"I've been listening to DMB for about 10 years and this CD is not nearly as good as the live ""rehash"" of hits he has put out in recent years.It took 12 tracks before I found one that I could listen to all the way through.My feeling is Dave is too wrapped up in politics and needs to spread his musical talents around to deal with other social issues and personal experiences. Most of his songs are like mini-sermons with each one speaking to the listener in a different way. Only with this album he has no musical river to carry his message. He has had a long career and maybe he has exhausted his creative talents.I still have tickets to his show in West Palm Beach and look forward to hearing what I think is the tightest live band perform once again."
2,Average.,"Very dissapointing. What more is there to say? Very repetitive. The only interesting song is ""Out of my Hands."" Dave, go solo again and put out some more inspired acoustical pieces."
3,It's not Crash,"I've been trying to like it all day. A couple songs are okay.. I guess with Dave Matthews I expect a CD where I like most of the songs, not just a few. It's disappointing. Dave has been talking about this being the best yet. I can't agree.Currently if you go to the VH1 website and search for the cd they have all the music available to listen to for free, full length, all songs. Maybe people should sample it first and then decide."
4,Give DMB a Break!!,"Ok first off, I like most of the other reviewers, am a hugh Dave Matthews fan. I have every single live cd and studio cd. People have been complaining that this cd is terrible, and I would have to disagree. This is a new CD for the band and they have decided to try a number of new things, which is a good thing seeing how they haven't released an album for a few years. I was excited to hear the new sound, especially after Some Devil. I personally would have been disappointed if this CD sounded just like the other CD's. I applaud Dave and the gang for trying something new. Plus if you don't like this CD, wait until they play the music live. This is a band that lives on the road and that is because they play best in front of an audience. So to those of you that have been reading these reviews that dog the band, and have decided not to buy the cd, reconsider and have an open mind."
1,WEAK,"I keep picking up Dave Matthews hoping somehow I would hear something like the albums ""Crash"" or ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" because those are some of the best all time albums in my opinion. DMB used to jam like no other and I could listen to them all day. ""Before These Crowded Streets"" came out with a couple of good songs, but really just marked the beginning of a downhill slide. ""Stand Up"" ""Recently"" and ""Some Devil"" are junk too. I have thrown away enough money, so I am done with DMB."
3,"Not the ""old dave""","All bands tend to ""grow up"" as they progess in their music careers. DMB obviously did that in ""Stand Up"", but, I was far more fond of their jams like in ""What would you say"" and ""All Along the Watchtower."" Although the slower songs work, they are not my cup of tea.Copy protection is a major downside to the album, but, it appears as if the record companies feel better putting this on, there is nothing us loyal consumers can do. Or is there? I know that with a little bit of ""google-ing"" and a little bit of computer knowledge , copy protection can be outsmarted. So, don't let that deter you from buying quality music.All in all, this is good listening, but, not DMB's best. Just different."
2,End of the Road for Dave Matthews,"If you haven't noticed by now Dave Matthews LOVES GIRLS, more of an obsession lyrically (wanted to follow the sweat running down her spine....geez dave). A kinda mellow down jam band style added to STAND UP, it shows potential in some areas, but as a whole this CD really doesn't deliever.PROS: Dream Girl, American Baby, Smooth Rider, Steady as We Go.Cons: Mainly Louisiana Bayou, the rest are better but mediocre DMB material. Oh yeah, (YOU CANT FKING BURN IT)DMB has had a great run with an uncountable list of good songs, although, this CD doesn't add many songs to that list, but I didn't really expect it too. Really just recommend for big DMB fans."
4,promising...definitely,"The first time I heard this album, I was disappointed. A week later, I saw DMB in concert where they played many of these songs live. I have found a new love for the album!!! As any DMB fan knows, the true heart of their music is with the live experience. These songs may disappoint some people if they just listen to the CD, but the band brings life to their new music in a live setting. Amazing! Now when I listen to the album, I have a new respect for the somewhat southern blues, scruffy voices, and classic dmb lyrics. Listen to it loud!"
5,Bring me back,"I at one time was a dave head. A dave head is a person stuck on only dave music. For the longest time I couldn't get into any other music. I finally did and have been listening to all kinds of great music. I was more then suprised when I heard the newest album. It is fantastic. This album is as good as anything they have ever created. I have not listened to dave in two years and now my reintroduction has been a splendid experience. The only complaint I have is the cover. I did'nt see the creativity. I looked deep but couldn't see past the firedancer of old. Buy it, these boys need more money!!"
3,Three and a half stars,"So the latest DMB release, Stand Up, had a different offering than what fans had been accustomed to getting with studio releases. On first listen, I enjoyed the selection but after a few more quality sessions I realized that a lot of the music was very processed. The almost over processing of the album made me long for the early days where the music was tight but had the feel of thrown together.I recommend this to complete any DMB fan's library and for cursory listenings. As for repeated listenings I caution the listener to space them out rather than expect it to be a back to back continous listening fest as could be experienced with previous releases."
4,Good album,"I am a long time DMB fan, own all of his albums, have seen him in concert many, many times, etc. I think this is a good album, but it had to grow on me more than his albums usually do rather than immediately grabbing my interest."
2,Concerts Suffering Too,"I saw DMB last night in Charlotte and had a mixed reaction. It was great to hear some of the old songs (Two Step, Crush, Say Goodbye) but they overdid it on the new stuff. I was extremely disappointed in their choice for an encore...Old Dirt Hill and What You Are. Whatever happened to Ants or Watchtower as a closer?? Most in the crowd were disappointed too. DMB is like a fish out of water. They need to get back to what made them famous or call it a day. The crowds are starting to slowly dwindle (Heck, I bought 2 great seats on e-bay for $21 each that had a face value of $57).I haven't bought the new CD and based on last night's show, probably won't."
2,Bring that beat back to me again...,"And by that, I mean the lyrical and compositional brilliance of the band's older works. No, this album is not terrible. In fact, if my expectations of the band weren't as high, I probably would have had a more accepting initial reaction to the simple, poppier beats. However, ""Stand Up"" is over-produced and tracks that translate to solid jams when performed live are cut to three minutes of synthesized repetition, such as the title track. Nevertheless, certain songs bring out the band's rockin' fresh sound, particularly ""Everybody Wake Up"", ""Smooth Rider"", and ""Hunger for the Great Light"", which brings out the song-writing talent of Stefan. So no, the album is not a total failure, though it's quite the adjustment to have to skip through songs on a DMB album."
4,Old and New,"I hear all of this complaining about how this CD isnt like the ""old DMB"" and I understand. But the fact is, if you want the ""Old DMB"" listen to the old albums over and over again (and its quite easy). Any band can just churn out the same album every two years and make their money and be happy. But what musicians do is evolve, they experiment, and they get older and have different thigs going through their head when they are writing. I was worried about this CD prior to its release, but after listening to it I realize how great it really is. Its not like the old days, but its something new and different. I like the experimenting with the different instruments and production, it shows a new side and shows some creativity. And the album does have songs that remind you of the 90's. This is a great album, better than the last two. You cant really be a fan of a band if you dont realize that not every album can sound the same."
2,True Fans??,"It's amazing to me how many reviewers claiming to be ""true DMB fans"" can give this album a positive review. If you ask me they're blinded by their ""true"" fan status. The truth is that this album is not that good. Where's the creativity? Where's the talent gone?? I have been a longtime fan of this band, attending concerts on an annual basis, buying albums, apparel, etc. However, in the past few years I have increasingly grown irritated with the direction of this band. All of the same, tired, live albums that have been released should have been a warning sign. DMB is out of material, creativity, whatever you want to call it. That's why this ""change"" has been brought about. Be a ""true"" fan, and be honest with yourself, this album is not the DMB we all grew to love. That DMB is officially gone."
4,good album....ok dmb album,"The album certainly has some great songs on it. Song like Everybody Wake Up and Hunger for the Great Light are remeniscent of earlier fan favorites like Rhyme/Reason. What sets this back from some of DMB's classic albums is this: Leroi and Boyd are not featured nearly enough. What sets DMB apart is the way all the musicians come together and the powering solos of the Violin and the Sax. This CD is a bit too raw for most hardcore DMB fans. I do think that when they play these songs live the band might have something up theyre sleve, as they always do, and throw the sax and violin into the songs a little more. So thats it. It's good music, but its not what you have come to know and love from DMB. Experimenting with a well known Pop/HipHop produce...probably not DMB's greatest move."
1,Everybody is right.............What is all the fuss about,"This sounds just like Dave Matthews, becuase in fact drum rolllllllll. Every single thing he does sounds the same. GASP! I know some frat boy wants to kick my ass right now, and his preppy little girlfriend is crying while watching her new boxset of Friends she got for Christmas, and I am trully sorry for that.I am kidding ofcourse I am not sorry in the least. Having heard every release by this crappy band, usually through a friend or two who pretend to like them becuase it's ""cool"" I noticed one thing that they have finally run their course and hopefully will give up. Seriously give me any example of how this sounds any different from any of their other releases. The tempo and the intstruments might change but the horrible Matthews sound is still front and center in everything they do! These guys allways have and always will SUCK!"
1,Never liked then and never will!,"Dave Matthews Band is most likely one if not the most over rated bands of all time. With that said,... well I guess that is all I have to say!"
1,JUST TERRIBLE!,"I used to love DMB, but their last couple of CD's have really been terrible. ""Stand Up"" is probably the worst of the bunch. Gone are the long jams you grew used to with DMB. Instead we get slick, polished tunes that last 4 minutes. I'm also tired of Dave making political statements on his CD's.I won't buy another DMB disc until Steve Lilywhite returns as producer.Save your money and don't bother with ""Stand Up""."
1,Digital Rights Management,So very uphappy. I only buy cd's to play on my iPod Shuffle and my computer. No other reason. CD turned out ok the one time that I listened to it on my standard CD player. In the future I will not buy any CD's with DRM on them.
2,"New direction, but still boring","Some people say that DMB's new direction should be welcomed and enjoyed. Being a fan of so many musical genres (half the reason I liked DM in the first place - their jazz/blues/rock etc combinations), I welcome anything as long as it's good - or at least interesting. DMB's latest offering has absolutely NONE of the elements that made it one of the most successful (and wealthiest) bands on the planet. Stand Up features one song that are worthy of the band: American Baby. Even this song isn't that good - like someone else said, it sounds like some B-side track that never made it to an original album. The rest of the album almost unbelievably boring and half way into the track you feel the urge to skip to the next. For a band that have captivated audiences into humming their tunes all day, this album is a devestating loss of direction, and judging by other comments on Amazon, it seems I'm not alone in my opinion. Skip it."
3,Tragic,"I love this band...probably more than anyone should love a band. ""Stand Up"" was my most anticipated release this year - I was, quite literally, counting the days. Dave's solo album was mindblowing. I thought for sure that ""Stand Up"" was going to reflect his (and the band's) growth, but it was a terrible disappointment. I'm sure that they will bring new life to these tracks on the road but it takes some time to get into this album...assuming you can get into it at all."
2,Like a funeral,"I used to drive to work and put in a DMB album and it was like there was a party in my car. With the last two or three studio albums, it sounds more like a funeral. I have loved this band for 10 years but I'm afraid this is the last album of theirs I'll buy. Sounded like they laid down one track with the sax and split it up among the 14 songs. And where's the violin?? I give up."
2,No So Great,"This album is not DMB, it sucks! Sorry Folks, but lets be real, no jazz undertones, no strings intersecting with the incredible sax interludes, no power vocals by Mr. Matthews, where are those great lyrics? What happened to the great stuff like Bartender, Everyday, Two Step, Crash, Dont Drink the Water, When the world Ends, Grey Street and Rapunzel? Not too sure how this album will be performed live, DMB's best recordings are his live recodings, Central Park Concert, Live at Folsom Field, The Meadows Concert etc, and they are based off of his great works as mentioned above. The CD is okay as its DMB but it does not supersede his previous studio albums such as Crash and Under the Table & Dreaming, and Before these crowded streets. His best works are anything live, my personal favorite is Live at Folsom Field follwed by Central Park and than the Meadows."
2,Not what DMB is capable of creating,"After spending some more time with it, I must change my opinion on the album. It simply isn't what DMB is capable of creating. It doesn't even come close to UTTAD or Crash. What happened to the display of musical talent? Now we get loops and electronic production??? It may have been a fun album to produce as seen by the DVD, but its hardly as listenable as early tracks. The acoustic riff that Dave played on the DVD was better than anything on the album. Ive seen them multiple times now, and support them because they are true talent. However this album is way overproduced, and barely displays their true talent. Its sad when Boyds biggest display is a plucked riff. Why not more of Leroi either???"
1,So much to say... but it is not very good.,"Wow, popped in this cd on the way home from work and was quickly suffering from buyers remorse. This could be the worst Dave Matthews Band studio album ever. The lyrics right off the bat without reading them sound more political than ever... the music is flat and uninspiring, and vocals sound like they were taped in a garage with faulty equipment. I love going to DMB concerts, but if I have to sit through most of these songs being played... I'm thinking of reconsidering going. I don't know, maybe they will grow on me, but I usually have 3-4 songs right off the bat that I really like and then the others grow on me... I find myself hating most songs more and more each time I listen to them... and find myself grabbing old albums and live shows to listen to instead. Perhaps they should have labeled this album ""Busted Stuff""."
2,"Make up your mind, Dave!","As a longtime DMB fan, I kindly ask the boys to please stop searching for a ""new sound"" and get back to the basics of what made me fall in love with their music...intense jams, complex rhythm patterns, and introspective lyrics (and a few other Jimi Things). Although I like several songs from ""Stand Up"" it gravitates too much toward the urban/pop sound that dominates mainstream radio today. Also, no matter what they think, DMB is not going to change the world with political statements in their lyrics (& SFX)...so why even bother? Besides, we get enough of that from TV and the news...we don't need it in our music as well. C'mon, Dave, make up your mind whether you want to be a pop star or a rock legend."
2,"it is a sad, sad day...","when dave matthews hires eminem and beyonce's producer. the end result is this cd full of absolutely nothing special. i've heard that the band is planning on keeping this producer? while it's great that the whole band had more of an input on the music, the fact remains that true dave fans are sorely disappointed in the band's new ""mass-produced""esque sound."
3,"yeah, but","It isn't that this doesn't sound like a DMB album. I am a big fan of mixing it up. It's that compared to the rest, it has a lot less soul. And I'm not talking about Aretha Franklin. There are rare occasion when it really grabs you and takes you somewhere (you ALL know what I'm talking about). Carter for most of the album is left sounding like every drummer for every 80's glam band.If y'all have seen the DVD you understand why the album seems to have so much hip hop influence. While there are 4 or 5 good songs, the rest is kind of like a great dish with not enough salt. Mostly I just don't get it, but I'm trying real hard.As for the copyright protection, my suggestion is to get burning software that was made this century. Nero burned my backup like any other..."
4,"Good, but not their best","I'm a big DMB fan, but this album was a lot less than I was expecting. There are about 4 songs on the CD that I can't get enough of, but the rest are just average, which isn't like most of their stuff. The packaging is pretty cool, but I would have liked to pay less and leave out the DVD."
4,"The sound is excellent, especially if you are a die-hard","First, I had no problem (w/the dual disc) getting it on iTunes & iPod. Second, the sound is fresh, a little more ""organic"" than previous releases, more R&B for sure, and has a political call. Even if you don't support the politics, the call to awareness is nice to see in pop music. I can only guess that the people having trouble getting onto their hard drives are placing it in the tray on the DVD side."
2,Not their best album,I have been a fan of dmb for forever and I would have to say this is their worst album. If you're looking to start out listening to them buy a live album which are always better than the studio albums and have all their better songs. You could also buy Crash or Under the Table and Dreaming. Don't judge them on this album.
2,Where have you gone?,"What happened to the DMB that I used to love? Since ""Before These Crowded Streets"" the DMB I used to know has all but disappeared. I suppose the writing was on the wall when ""The Lillywhite Sessions"" became ""Everyday"" and ""Busted Stuff"". This album is no different from the last two. Over produced to the point of boredom. Dave seems to sing each song with melencholy. The band doesn't sound like they are having any fun, like this is work. If you are looking for some jams with the whole band get ready for a few teases but nothing to satisfy you appetites. Again the talents of Leroi are dismissed. I continue to hope that someday in the future DMB returns to its roots but it seems that this is fading. In the past I was so excited to get the new DMB album. It is a shame I won't feel that way again."
1,This is B side album,This is the worst album of 2005. DMB is gone bad now. What happened to Jam sessions? Even debut album of other bands are good. Stay away from this one.
1,"This Album sucked, Thumbs way down, worst DMB to date.","Horrible writings, songs, and lyrics..i'm so sad i wasted time and money on this crap."
3,The first DMB album I actually like,"For Dave, I think this is a good album. It won't be attractive, at first, to his base of fans, but I think it reaches out to people who like Dave, but get sick of him after an entire album. I think the groupies that venerate Dave expect the same from Dave always, but this album explores a different territory than they are familiar with. I'm not a die hard fan, by any means, my fiancé purchased this album on iTunes... BUT, I like it. I can tell Dave has been hanging out with some talent when making this album, and it rubbed off on him."
1,Listen to it before you buy!!!,"I love DMB, and I'm sure as most, I love them more than anybody else, so you must listen to my opinion because I'm an expert... this CD is horrible. I was in the middle of ordering it on Amazon when my girlfreind whipped it out of her purse. We just listened to it and I am sick to my stomach. I hate this CD sooo much. I just spent all day listening to Live at Luther and Busted Stuff and was pumped up for summer, then I sit down tonight and loose all of this respect for Dave. Did he even listen to it or are they so big now they can shat on a disk and make it gold? Now, bare in mind, even though I hate it, you of cousre may love it, just listen to it before you buy. If you DO like it that's great but it's not going to be because you liked them in the past. Uhhg so sick. I feel like a little boy that just saw his Mom kissing the Milkman."
1,Beware copy protected !,"The 1 star is for the copy protection. I don't steal CDs, I upload them to a computer hard drive to stream through a high end audio system. People have always found a way around these copy protections. When they do find the way around, suddenly this protection only becomes a pain for those that are legitimate owners."
1,Sigh - another copy protected coaster,"I am a huge DMB fan, buying this cd would normally be a nobrainer but it's copy protected, so I can't copy it to my iPod or play it on my Sonos so I am not buying. I know that this version of copy protection is easily circumvented if you know how but we all know it won't stay that way for long. Vote with your wallets."
1,"It's just not Dave, and it's not good","Like most reviewing this CD, I've been a fan of DMB for a long time, seen them live a bunch, etc... This CD is really not DMB, it's their new sound, and to me, it's lazy and I couldn't find one melody worth even spending .99 cents online to download. For those who are giving this CD 4 or 5 stars, I really think you're being too generous or letting your love for DMB's old stuff influence your judgment here. Bottom line for me is if you're new to Dave, you'll never want to ever listen to this album, and if you've listened to Dave for a while, odds are you won't like this new sound, it's pretty boring and not very musical.Here's something weird as a side note, all of Dave's ""pop, new sounding stuff"" has had black, white and gray covers, and all of his older, good music has been colorful. Think about it, Everyday, Some Devil and now this piece of garbage, although I have to say Everyday and Some Devil were both pretty good."
4,A Good New Sound,"I just bought the new DMB album and have been listening to it all day. I was looking to hear songs that had that same catchy rhythm that DMB uses so very often, but instead I was blasted by a different sound. I think Dave and the boy's have done a good job in creating such a smooth record. I disagree with people who say they don't like the long drawn out songs, but the short and simple ones. DMB has created a machince built soley on long jams and has flourished ever since. Stand Up brings the feeling of summer into our veins when listening to it and gives us that high that we need."
2,David,"This album is okay, not really up to par with their other albums. I hope the band goes back to there original style. DMB made a mistake having Mark Baston produce their album. The only good song on this is American Baby......"
2,What Happened?,"What happened to the old Dave Matthews Band is what I am asking myself after listening to the album. When I heard American Baby on the radio I thought to myself ok this cd will probably be like Everyday, I was half right! These songs just dont flow, I don't listen to them and want to replay them because i cannot relate to any of the songs. I was really looking forward to this cd and now i am truly dissapointed!"
1,Where did DMB go???,"I have always been a DMB fan. I love their music. This CD however, is horrible. It does not even sound like DMB. The vocals, lyrics, sound, style and even use of instruments are all different. Dave has lost his passion for meaningful music in this allbum. It makes me mad. This CD sucks! Something I thought I would never say about DMB. Please, do not buy this CD if you really like old DMB. If you really want it, mine is up for grabs!"
1,"""Enhanced"" features made it useless","I picked up a copy of this album this morning and never made it out of the parking lot. I don't know if it's the ""enhanced features"" or the anti-piracy technology, but my car CD player just spun the disc and then displayed ""CD Error."" I exchanged it and repeated got the same results. I returned it.I seem to be one of the only people who hasn't jumped into mp3s whole hog. I don't pirate music, I don't swap or share online, and I pay the ridiculous prices for CDs. Now, I'm out of luck in listening to an album I'd been looking forward to for several months."
3,"Not Bad, But better than more recent albums","After my initial listen of this album I thought it sucked. Then I listened to it about 4 more times and then realized that this album is way better than Busted Stuff and Everyday. What I think the album lacks is a signature radio hit like Stay or Ants Marching. But as far as a whole album goes it is much more solid than their last two efforts (which I think produced those radio hits but as far as albums go sucked). Carter is back to better drumming (although not like the first 3). He was the reason I got into this band and I am glad to see he is back. I stayed away for a bit of listening to DMB but I like this album enough to come back. I can't wait for a live album of these tracks, especially Dream Girl, Old Dirt Hill, American Baby, and Hello Again (my favorite track)."
2,Further Down the Spiral,"Anyone else want to help start a collection to get Steve Lillywhite back in the Dave Matthews Band camp. DMB reached it's pinnacle with Before These Crowded Streets and has been on a steady decline ever since. The latest release has so much influence of the producer's hip hop and pop experiences, it detracts from anything positive on this album. Dreamgirl is a very good song, but beyond that, everything is averate at best.With releases like Everyday and Stand Up, it will not be long until VH1 airs the Dave Matthews Band, Where Are They Now. Unfortunate."
1,What,The album has about 2-3 solid songs. There is alot electronic hip-hop beats that don't work. Craptacular
1,wasted money,"this is the worst cd. Have no idea what the songs are like, because I cannot play the damn thing on a regular cd player or even my DVD player hooked to stereo- on which it will play but you can't control it or skip forward or back. On the computer, you cannot get around this mandatory Dell player built into the disk to force you to use it to open it. You cannot download the songs onto your IPod. This is a completely commercialized CD that is designed to force you to use Dell's player and of all bands to sell out to commercial forces, I did not expect DMB to do so. I will never buy another CD from DMB or any CD labelled DualDisc and DMB owes its fans an apology."
3,Not what I expected at ALL- 3 good tracks MAX,"I LOVE the whole Crash album. I have to admit that the Stand Up album left me feeling disappointed. American Baby sounds like a typical ""Dave"" song. I really like Hunger for the Great Light, but it doesn't sound like a DMB song at all; it's really sexy though. Lousianna Bayou is kind of fun, too. Most of the other songs left me wanting my Crash CD. I still love the band though, and I can't wait to see them live again this summer. I just hope they play some of their old stuff instead of this new crap."
2,Far from classic DMB,This really is an awful album for reasons that many have laid out already. But for everyone complaining about the copy protection on this CD... just hold down the Shift key as you pop it in your computer. I ripped it with no problem.
2,"Disappointing with a Capital ""D""","I was eagerly awaiting this new release and am extremely disappointed. If you thought Dave's solo effort ""Some Devil"" was good you'd probably be able to live with ""Stand Up"".It amazes me how the single on most CD's is the only good song. The same applies with American Baby. No other song is close to it. Save your cash!!!"
1,Copy protection is a big minus,"Sorry Dave (Mathews) ... I really wanted this CD, but I returned it because of the copy protection ... without even opening it. I can only vote with my money ... so this is all I can do. I would be happy for Sony to give me the CD for my time and trouble, otherwise, let's join a class action suit!"
1,More copy-protected BS,"Wow, what a stupid thing to do: make an audio CD that installs SPYWARE without the consumer's knowledge. And if you want to rip this to your iPod (or anywhere else) FORGET IT.This copy-protected thing has GOT to go."
1,Qué es esto?'???,"Demasiado comercial, y con el productor terminaron de desenfocarse, el album es una pena, nada comparado con ningún otro albúm de la banda, incluso que everyday. Definitvamente trabajar con Mark Batson no funciona, los cambios son buenos pero cuando son para bien y en éste albúm creo que a varios y en mi opinión a mi, me ha dejado decepcionado. Y creo que la gente que hace una crítica buena debería de reaccionar y comparar....No habrá opción mas que esperar otros 2-3 años para ver que sucede con esta banda (otra producción)...espero se nivelen otra vez y definitivamente que ya no trabajen con Mark Batson.Muy Fan de DMB pero esto ....Definitivamente Malo!=("
2,Not DMB and Not Worth It,"I have listened to DMB since 1995. My first album was Under the Table and Dreaming, the second Crash, and so on. I was extremely excited in 2005 when they were releasing a new album. Then, I listened to the album. There are basically three or four songs that I can stand listening to. Other than that, this album is utterly terrible. The use of drum machines masks the actual musical talent of these musicians. The lyrics of many of the songs are quite weak (see Everybody Wake Up, Dreamgirl, Stand Up...I could go on. I write this after the release of the group's latest studio album, Big Whiskey and the Groogrux King, which I enjoyed very much. So the band isn't totally inept in the 21st century. But for those of you looking to enjoy DMB's standard alternative folk rock with musical brilliance, avoid Stand Up altogether."
4,Dave Matthews Band Review,"Dave Matthews Band never fails to create great music. This CD is a little bit more upbeat than their past CDs, but the style is basically the same. It's great!"
3,Help Steve Lilywhite,"There are parts on this album that are alright...but overall it is hard to see it ever growing on me...who knows...maybe it willBut really, where is steve lilywhite when you need him? COME BACK/GET HIM BACK so we can get back to the dave that we love...the dave that we like to hear when we go to his concerts."
2,Listened to it at least 10 times since Friday (FS rules),"Sounds more like a Dave solo album to me. Where are the jams? Where is the band soloing ? Why bury the sax? Please stop with hoping that a producer of pop acts can help get you that hit single....Jam Jam Jam...you do it in concert so do it within the confines of the song on CD...Check out some of the other acts at Bonaroo, look at the size of the crowds for jam based music....we don't need another 50 cent Eminem or Alanis Morrisette ..we need musicianship."
1,Wow - I never dreamed it could be so BAD - Negative points,"It's rough. We like DMB and owe them so much for the pleasant memories. Hey DMB, ONLY your true friends are going to tell you the truth. This is GARBAGE but it has POTENTIAL. Yes we throw this thing around the office like a frisbee. We don't want to hurt you guys so we have a solution to this mess. Just get Reynolds on the line and have him mess with each song for about an hour. I PROMISE - you will have something interesting, creative, non-commercial and certainly not boringly pathetic. And get rid of that Bela Flek sax player and give some studio musician a chance. LeRoi Moore, a master, deserves better than to be replaced by some bela flek novice. Get Sonny Rollins or somebody with a clear understanding of Jazz and not Jazzercise. No offense to bela and his little band, your good enough to exist but you guys are not that great. Sad, at this point it would seem as though DMB disolved after crowded streets."
3,You might die trying?,Am I the only one who thinks it sounds like they used a sample on this song? I can't quite figure out what song it is though.
3,The Old DAVE is GONE along with Grace,"Long since are the days of Under the Table and Dreaming or even Crash and this CD proves it. The more up tempo songs on this CD are just mildly more up beat than Proudest Monkey, its like Kit Kat Jam with words. This CD feels more like an extension of his solo CD, which was good because it was him with out the band, but when DMB has a new CD out I hold myself full of hope that it will be another great party atmosphere CD, like the early ones.Overall its DMB so its good but this maybe the sign that the old Dave has gone along with Grace."
2,Very Disappointing,After all the trouble it took me to get this album on my iPod I found that it wasn't worth the effort. Too political and preachy.
1,Gathering Dust,"I love DMB. I have loved DMB since I was 15 years old (and that was longer ago that I'd like to admit). I buy all of the albums as soon as they come out and almost all of them get regular rotations through the CD player. The only two that do not are Everyday and this one. I often wait until after I have heard the songs in concert to judge the album; but after back-to-back shows this past weekend, I'm sad to say that, in spite of my best intentions of trying very hard to like this album, its just going to stay on the shelf gathering dust."
3,iTunes Compatible...from .wav to AAC with no problems!,"I read all the warnings posted here and was concerned about issues I might have ripping DMB's ""Stand Up"" CD...but tried it anyway: AND IT WORKED FINE. Try this (make sure iTunes is your default player): (1) Launch iTunes (2) Insert CD (3) Wait for iTunes to generate the song names (4) Rip the disc. This five second labor intensive process did not prompt a user agreement, crash Windows, or eject the CD at any time. (Sorry this is specific to only iTunes- if you use Creative MediaSource Organizer or any other software application you're on your own.)"
4,The concept within,"While this is not my favorite Dave Matthews Band album, I find that there is a deeper concept to the album than just the songs themelves, which I think is pretty impressive. In order to appreciate this album, you have to let it hit you on a more serious emotional level, unlike most of their other albums. There are some more typical Dave Matthews songs, like Dreamgirl, which has a sexy appeal, and Steady As We Go, but it is necessary to listen to this album several times in order to make a good jugement on their latest work."
2,Remember Two Things.... Go back to the root,"I have been a DMB fan for over 12 years and this new album takes some getting use to! I did not like it at first, but I can listen to it. I can say I do not have a favorite song on the album yet. They have strayed again from their roots. Albums like ""Remember Two Things,"" ""Under the Table and Dreaming,"" ""Recently,"" and yes... even ""Busted Stuff"" are more DMB's style. The band should have learned this with their release of ""Before These Crowded Streets."" This release was so poor, DMB fans were sharing a bootleg known as the ""White Lily Sessions,"" which ended up being 90% ""Busted Stuff."" I bought it and if you are a DMB fan, buy it, but do not expect ""typical"" DMB sound!"
1,"Oh my god, DMB got three strike on this one","Humm...I've been a DMB fans since the first album but I think Dave is lacking creativity these days. His solo album was so-so and this Stand Up album is very close to 'Up in the Garbage'. What a disappointment!!!! Nothing close to 'Crash' or 'Under the table dreaming'. I've been listening to this album more than 10 times and beside 'Dream Girl' and 'American Baby', they won't attract too much attention with this crappy album. Also, to make it play on my laptop was pain, as I had to install protective software to prevent illegal copies. Maybe Dave should worry more about his music than people stealing it, as few will do it with Stand up....You can do better Dave!!!"
2,Stand up lets down,"Dave Matthews felt it necessary to erase all artistic talent from this disc. I kept wondering if they left out some of the tracks from the recording, because all I heard was his voice, drums, and poorly mic'd up guitar. Perhaps he used up all his material on Trey and Tim, but even Some Devil wasn't that great. The narratives of the songs are the same old topics that will make your college girlfriend happy: sex, wine and pot. This is what commerically popular artists do, the find a niche and milk it. Once again I'm telling myself I'll never buy another Dave Matthews album, perhaps I will if the rest of the band shows up."
1,Stand Up....,"...and walk out on Dave Matthews Band! Honestly, has any ""songwriter"" done more with less? I have seen bands of high school kids write and perform better music. High school freshmen."
2,A letdown...,"I am a big Dave Matthews Band fan, I have all their CD's and DVD's. And this by far was very dissappointing...........dont waste your money........its not worth it, the old music is better!"
3,"Decent album, but technological disaster....","The album is growing on me after a couple of days, but as with a previous review I read i am unable to load this cd onto my computer. without this i am unable to use it on my ipod. i rarely use cd players any more and this screws me over. record companies should make sure their damn cds actually work before packaging them up and shipping them out. thanx RCA (don't blame this on Dave)"
2,Mark Batson is an evil genius,"The fault with this album is its producer, Mark Baston who is known for his work with pop starslike Beyonce and 50 Cent. He admittedly played a very hand with regards to the production of this album. The net result is the loss of the DMB sound fans expect to hear.Beyond producing, Batson actually PLAYS on virtually every track. His re-engineering of DMB is just awful. The songs from the 2004 tour showed so much promise and only one made it to Stand-Up,'Hello Again.' Sadly, Batson insinuates his instrument, the organ at the expense of the violin and sax.DMB's drummer is arguably their most talented musician and his drumming sounds as if it could be duplicated by a drum machine.I am saddened and rather disappointed. Dave said in an interview last year that the bands last best album was ""Before These Crowded Streets,"" I have to agree."
1,copy protected CD,Amazon is selling a copy protected CD that cannot be transferred to an iPod for personal use. Don't be bullied and do not buy this CD!
1,Different isn't always good,"I'm sick of everyone saying this album is good because it is ""different"". Just because a band puts out an album that is different doesn't mean it is good. DMB could put out a samba album and while i would respect the fact that they were trying something new, it doesn't change the fact that it sucks. This album is very different from their classic first 4 albums (UTAD, Crash, Before these crowded streets, lillywhite sessions/busted stuff), but that new direction isn't as good as the old one. The live oriented old DMB is the DMB that everyone loves and embraces, and there new, over-produced, strictly studio sound frankly isn't a good fit for the band. I do respect them for trying something new, but it just isn't as good. Don't but this album, just pray that DMB will get back together with Steve Lillywhite on the next ambum."
3,Probably the worst DMB album to date,"I have been a fan of the DMB for about 10 years now. I make a point to buy every new album the day it come out. I was very excited when I heard ""American Baby"" as I thought it was a great song and it made the album look promising. I was wrong. It is a shame because it followed Dave Matthews solo debut album which was awesome. The album has a few solid songs but all in all, it is the worst DMB album. The title track is not bad, but the chorus is a little repetitive. Out of My Hands is a relatively simple (not DMB usually stuff) song but a great track. Lousiana Bayou is positively annoying (a bit too many ""ohh, ahh's"") and I think that I have never said that about any DMB song.I gave the album 3 stars because I could not bring myself to give Dave Matthews less than that. I am praying that he comes out with another solo album or gets it together for the next DMB album. I have faith!"
1,Awful album,"I wish I could give this zero stars.When the first verse of the first song goes something like ""digging my way to china, and if I was there, I would dig my way back just to be with you ..."" you know your in deep do-do. Come one Dave, you can write way better lyrics than that. May of the other songs are just as pitiful.The guitar and arranging. Sure they are a tight band, but there was nothing interesting on this album what so ever. Basic licks, some horn and the drums. Where's the talent, guys? Where's teh jazzy, funk riffs? Where is Bory'd violin?A few of the songs sound muddy.Oh, and the DRM. Yeah, the very LAST DMB album I buy."
2,Dissapointed DaveFan,"I am a longtime fan of the DMB and own nearly every album I have listened to this album several times through and it does nothing for me. Even after watching the accompanying DVD and listening to the Band's repeated insistence that this is their best stuff ever, I am left cold. If this indeed is the direction the band is going, it is time for me to find a new cool band."
1,DMB: Shark Jumpers Supreme,"I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet. I felt that the record they did with Glenn Ballard was a reasonably listenable waste, but thought they made a strong recovery on the next one, ""Busted Stuff"" (which was the record they SHOULD have released instead of the Ballard one). ""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back. Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions. I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all. I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available."
1,DMB being greedy is not news...,"What's new with Dave and the guys trying to make extra bucks??? Have you guys not found a warehouse flyer on every single dmb cd??? I have and I always thought he was a greedy 84$%*rd but hey who cares, as long as the music is good... But what really agravates me is the fack that they are putting all this copyright crap on their cds... It happened to me already once with ""Some Devil"" which I ended up returning as I live with my mp3 player attached to my ears... I can't believe he did it again... The label is inducing people to look for alternate ways of getting music(not legal ones)... I actually wanted the actual cd for collecting purposes..."
5,Their Best Yet,"I have almost every cd they have made(except Everyday). I can't imagine how anyone who likes this band would not like this cd. There is something here for eveyone. Not a song on this cd I don't like. I have alot of cds by some very good bands, but this one I have had in my ipod shuffle and played nonstop at the gym since I got it. American Baby and Everybody WakeUp are the best post 9-11 songs written about our great country.Why do some people want every cd of DMB to sound like the first one they ever made. How boring would that be. Musicians are suppose to grow, not play repiticious music. Buying this cd is a really good purchase and well worth your hard earned money. Buy and enjoy."
4,Stand up or Shut up,"In listening to the new DMB album, it seems to generate mixed responses. Always experimenting and crossing over the demographic borders, DMB has articulated what they want to say. Of course most wont get it, but then again are they musicians?For the people who were moaning about the Everyday album being to commercial, did they figure in that most of these songs as with Stand Up will be played live, and that they will take on a completely new shape and form in an ARENA. Maybe your hi-tech stereo doesn't sound as good as you thought, but it will at your Dunkin donuts,Staples or 3Com park arena.The boys have made a great album that actually makes a statement (wow that's a change from modern music) having something to say is what music is all about.Thank you Dave and the boys, this fan is happy......."
2,Strangely confusing,"When I heard this album it made me feel...well, nothing. In the past I have counted on The Dave Matthews Band to get me through some tough times. Listening to their music made me feel something that cannot be described in words...a connection to both the lyrics and music, if you are a fan you know what I am talking about. When I listened to this album I felt like the band betrayed me. This was not at all what I expected. I never really cared for American Baby but I was willing to give the album a try and now I am mad at myself for making that decision. This album is not worthy of the Dave Matthews Band name. I can only hope that they don't release such undeserving material in the future."
4,I like it...after listening for the last few months.,"Every time a new DMB cd is released, I buy it. I don't always like it right away (and I really DID NOT like Stand Up at all on the first few playings), but I put it in my car and it plays several times and before I know it I'm playing it over and over again because I like the songs. On Stand Up, I agree there are some commercial success type songs, but I personally like Down on the Bayou...at first I thought it was hokey and now I will back track to listen to it over again...It's Dave's unique voice on this cd that makes it for me."
1,Lame music for a lame band,The DRM copyright managment says it all. If you like music made by CPAs then this is the ticket. You can't get more middle of the road than this kind of bland music.
2,Commits the worst crime of all: forgettability,"I seem to have lost my copy of this record, and I'm not really mourning it--not nearly as much as ""Busted Stuff."" Yeah, DMB tried to write songs with the same types of melody and freeform as their early work, but this feels forced. And I remember exactly one musical phrase from the whole album, whereas I could sing you the entirety of ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" if you asked me to. Don't bother with this one, it's a dud."
5,A review of the music,"When I first heard this album I didn't think it was that good. Then, two years later I listened again and I loved it. It's funny how you can dislike something if you're in the wrong mood for it. It's different for sure, and I'm sure that turned off many a DMB fan, but most of the songs are very good.However, where DMB scores one in the music category, they continue to let themselves be whores to their record label. The whole ""enhanced"" cd thing is lame, and I completely understand someone giving this album one star because of that. When is their record contract up? Whenever it is, I certainly hope DMB goes the route of Nine Inch Nails and ditches their label. There was also the whole fiasco with Lillywhite Sessions/Busted Stuff/Everyday. Such a shame the forces of evil have so much power in the recording industry."
1,Save your money,"Upon receiving this disc for my birthday, I was excited to listen to it as I had heard so much about how good this band was. I gave it an honest listen at least five times. With each listen, I became more and more puzzled. ""What's the hype about?"" Each and every song sounds the same; overly synthetic instrumentals with vocals relying on heavy electronic enhancement. They all just blend together into a mish-mash of techno-pop. Aside from the fact that it doesn't sound good, the anti-piracy software is not a selling point. Politically, the disc is so overtly leftist that only a tried and true ""blue-stater"" will not be turned off. In a word, save your money and buy a different CD or book instead."
3,I've heard better,"Yeah... so when I first heard the CD and his tired voice sing some tripe about digging to China, I was imediately turned off. Of course ,the rest of the song wasn't bad. I like the backing vocals and whatever.... I'm a ramblin' guy.. a ramblin...(sorry , Steve Martin popped in for a sec)My first CD was ""Before These Crowded Streets"" I was in high school at the time, I've played drums and part of the inspiration for me was the drumming. But the band used to really excplore the posibilities of music. That was more inspiring. Now everything musical about the band is placed in the background of Dave's singing. With the way his voice has seemingly deteriorated, it's always good to play on strengths. Go back to the band, solos, jams...Dave's guitar work is excellent, play on THAT strength.Great musicians take risks. Where are the risks these days?"
1,What a let down,"Really all of the past reviews have been dead on about the album being the DMB's worst. Coming from a big fan this album was a really big let down. In past albums the band has come together beautifully, but there was too much Dave and not much of the band in ""Stand Up."" The new album sounds nothing like the old albums and like someone said earlier, it was over produced, Dave's voice sounded different for one. The album was just all the same, very bland. The band really needs to think about going back to their old ways and spend a lot more time working on some better writing."
1,What happened??,Wow! Man i've been so pumped up for a new studio album and this has let me down really bad. I was expecting something along the lines of Everyday or Crash and this is not it. There songs sound almost like Dave's solo album which was crap. I have been a fan of them for a while now and this upsets me. This album will not be in my collection.
2,Where is the Band?,I have been a pretty big fan since my brother got Under the Table way back when. Ever since then i have bought every cd I can get my hands on. Since Everyday I have had my doubts about where they were going with their music. One of the biggest reasons this band is so big is because of their awesome musical talent with instruments. This cd has none of that. Its been over produced or something ( I dont know much about producing music). All you hear is Dave. WHich is not all that bad. But were they hell is the band? I did not know this was going to be Dave singing with a little touch of back ground music. I am going to see them this summer. I hope they play some of these songs so i can hear them live and not some studio recording.
4,The DMB SOUND,I've read all the reviews and it kills me to read these things. All the people on here never gave this album a chance. There's alot of great tracks on here and just because it's different doesnt mean its bad. Let it go people the DMB want to do things different. You cant like in the crash era or the under the table and dreaming days forever. Real fans appreciate the variety and the ever exploring nature of the bad. I think this a solid album that hopefully will bring new fans to my favorite band.Great songs on here.Stolen away on 55th and 3rdDream GirlHello AGainOld Dirt HillLouisiana BayouSmooth Rider.Give it a chance people.
2,this makes everyday look great,"too much hip hop drum stuff here. what happened to stuff like the stone, lie in our graves and jimi thing? stand up makes everyday sound like led zeppelin's ZOSO. gah. BUT! if you are lucky and get to see dave on tour, the songs are MUCH better."
1,Awful,"I love Dave Matthews, but this cd is just awful. It has too much of a pop feel, and I just dont see the raw traditional Dave that is so great. I hope this was a one time thing."
2,What were they thinking?,"Being a long time fan of DMB and follower of even there most repetitive recreations of live albums I was expecting something big with Stand Up. Hoping to find a cool blend of Dave Matthews and His Band, something in between Everyday and Busted Stuff. What I came across was a travesty to his music. There are exactly 4 good songs on this album. Three spins through and thats all I can really stand. Some people are praising the studio trickery that the producer of 50cents last album added to this effort. I question..why the hell use the producer of 50cent and Eminem on a thouroughly original and talented group like DMB??? I find this album to be absolutely inorganic, the lyrics to be uninspired (and how hard is that to achieve on a politically driven album???), the bands play seems commercial and chord ridden...almost simple, all in all this album is a huge disappointment and I will go listen to The Gorge and wait for something good."
2,bad bad bad,"I have been a fan of DMB since 1994 when I first saw the 'What Would You Say' video on VH1. To date, I have all of the studio albums and a couple of live albums and can only recall skipping one track (PROUDEST MONKEY-not a fan). I can tell you that this album has maybe 4 good songs on it, the rest I skip. Getting 50 Cent's producer to show them how to loop was a HUGE mistake. I hope to hear good stuff coming out in 2009 (my hopes is there is a studio version of Corn Bread-it was my favorite on the Radio City Music CD with Tim Reynolds)"
1,stand up? sit down...,"Please... what happened to DMB? this album is wayyy over produced and it just doesn't have that signature DMB sound to it. You can really tell that a hip-hop producer produced this record as the drums have an in your face rap and R&B; sound to it, which just makes it worse in my opinion.. They really bombed on this one. It seems like thier musical creative minds have left and this is the result. As for the lyrics..please, I don't care about your political views, nor should you be singing about them. The only band that could get away with that and did it well was Rage Against The Machine. DMB should have stuck with what works.. Anyone who has given this album a 5 star rating is undoubtebly to me a ""DMB can do no wrong"" type of fan who'll give 5 stars to anything they put out to make themselves a few extra bucks.And please, Dave, don't put out another Live album. I mean how many versions of crash into me do we need to hear?"
3,You cant play it on your Ipod of PC......BOO HOO!,"Get a real CD player and a real sound system. The latest flashy digital media on your PC and Ipod cant compete with a good dedicated Audio CD player. Its a CD for christ sake...why ruin the quality and your listening experience by downgrading to an inferior media form?!?! And you are all rating a DMB CD like trash cause you cant have this? Maybe thats the point, maybe DMB felt that relatively low bit rates and poor playback quality was hurting their sound, which is a very instrumental, dynamic one recorded with pride. I cant believe these reviews, you ought to be ashamed."
1,"DMB is dead, look elesewhere","The only thing close to DMB about this album is the TITLE.Cheaply produced album, uncatchy, uninspiring.It's a mockery to all DMB fans around the world.I'm not sure that there would be next album.Probably Dave is aiming for a second solo album, gloomier than the first.."
1,Terrible Album,"Let me start with the thing that has got me really mad right now. If you read the back of the disc case, it clearly states that this CD is not made up to the red book specifications for a CD. So what does that mean? Well, for starters, this disc won't even play in my $3900 Cary CD player!!!!! It won't even read the disc!!! I had to use my portable player just to even listen to it!! These record companies are so damn worried about copyright stuff that they make CD's which don't even meet reguired specifications. This is a joke."
4,"Dave ""Drop the Deuce"" Matthews does it again!","This is a beautiful, textural work documenting the inherent vapidity of the suburban soul. This is the perfect music to which you might study Feng Shui or drive to the outskirts of the wilderness in your SUV with a bunch of new sporting equipment only to return a couple days later with it as new as it was when you packed it up. Drastically outclasses the vast majority of other current singer/songwriter releases on the market right now, so it earns 4 stars."
5,"Different, but Great","I've been a fan of DMB for some time--all of the CDs and annual attendance at their concerts. I was hoping that this CD would sound diffferent than the other albums...some of them have blurred together because they sound so similar. This CD fills that role...its like hearing John Mayer play ""Message in a Bottle""...you know the artist, but its so cool to hear it. In this case DMB actually authored these songs too, so its an even sweeter deal to hear them breaking the mold."
2,The answer,"To all you reviewers who are trying to figure out ""what went wrong"" with this cd, here is the answer.... it is not that good. It simply does not have that instant classic in the bunch. Here is what may be the problem - Maybe you fans have grown up. I found out about 5 years ago that the farther away from college, the worst this band sounds. They are the ""frat band"". There is no real substance to them.That said, I hate the live jams. I prefer the quick 4-5 minutes the way the song is recorded. Even with that in mind, I still did not care too much for this album. Save your money.Also, this band really loves their fans, with all the tricky work they did to make it impossible to burn this cd, or even play it in a computer. That is sad."
4,Something different,"I don't know why people are afraid of something a little different. Come on how many DMB CD's do we all own by now? Lots I am sure. It's nice when each one suits your moods at different times. I don't know about you but I don't want to listen to the same kind of CD all the time. As I am sure they don't like making the same kind of CD all the time. Is it their greatest Cd? In my opinion, No. But it is worth buying and it is still good to listen to. I agree it may need a 2nd or 3rd listen to decide. Because in my experience the CD's you like on the first try are the ones that get old real quick as opposed to those that you need to warm up to."
1,Anyone who likes this album is NOT A DMB FAN!,"Everyone lists their credentials as a fan of the DMB first in their reviews. I will spare you that, but I will let you know my Warehouse number is one of the lowest out there. I have been extremely dissapointed in every release since the departure of Steve Lillywhite as their producer. Their sound, once rich with the voice of each band members instruments, has become void of any type of appeal that attracted me and most other DMB fans in the early years. Of course bands change, but DMB has become a slicked down, over produced band. I would recommend that no one buy this album. If you haven't listened to DMB before, go buy and older album that is produced by Steve Lillywhite. You will thanks me, unless you are a Britney/NSYNC fan, then you might like this new release."
3,The evolved DMB,"Straight up, if you like DMB because of their traditional melodical upbeat nursery rhyme style songs you probably won't like this album. You need to change trains and find another cool band. Now if you loved Some Devil and Seattle and staying home all day (just kidding) you'll probably love this album. Also if you prefer the bars over the coffee shops you should stick with their earlier stuff also. This album has a distinct coffee shop feel and you might describe it as coffee with a hint of adult contemporary pop. Maybe this album is a statement of rebellion against being rich and having a good time? I thought music (and booze) were designed so common folk could forget their problems, not be reminded of them. Maybe they'll come around on their next album. C'mon guys, eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die - right?"
2,Very dissapointed,"This cd is not near as good as the other dave matthews band cds. Electronic beats and way too much repetitive drumming on the album, not the same dave. Change isn't always bad but for this, by far their worst album."
1,Music: So-So. Copy Protection: Bad idea.,"Thankfully the band has tried something different...unfortunately it doesn't work. Perhaps the worst moments occur as The Millionaire Dave tries to churn out some anti-war protest material. Terrible stuff.Then there's the copy protection...I don't blame the band, but I instead blame the record label. No, it doesn't ""crash your systems"" or ""fry your PC"" as others have said. You can grab the ISO image and pick out the .WAVs then encode them for MP3 and you can iTunes your little hearts out. Is it a pain? Yes. Is this breaking the law? No - it's fair-use of your property, as long as you don't share it. Was this a good business decision? Absolutely not."
2,Bad blues?,"This is definitely a departure from what most people view as the DMB (i.e.: Under the table & dreaming, Crash, etc), so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for.It sounds more like a bad blues album with a lot of musical/lyrical repitition and lack of the normal insightful/creative lyrics that I've come to expect from these guys. I bought it because I like the African influenced rhythms in the first few tracks, but I'm dissapointed in the quality of Matthew's singing on this."
3,Change Producers Much?,"Old Dirt Hill, Stand Up, Louisiana Bayou...all great songs. As for the rest of the album, I think someone put a governor on Carters sticks. Where is the spice? There are way too many electronic drum sounds on this album. Everything sounds so straight forward and bland. This is not DMB...this is RnB."
4,Don't Blame DMB,"Okay, dont blame the band if your computer is messed up, not their fault. Hold the shift key while you insert the disk, this will disable the ""enhanced"" features of the disk.Also, don't blame DMB for moving on. If you are looking for Under the Table or Crash, you are not going to like this album. This is a new DMB direction, a fresh start, and a great one! The sounds are fresh, with an R&B; feel that really makes this album something special. I am an avid DMB fan, and was horrified at Everyday, saddened by Busted Stuff (thank God for the Lillywhite's), and Some Devil put me to sleep. I bought this album as a last prayer that the band would find thier groove again, and they did. I recomend this album to anyone with an open mind, for the rest of you, go listen to Crash for the 163543216574651246121 time."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! BLUE SCREENS YOUR PC,"This is unbelievealbe. If you have autoplay enabled and insert this cd into your PC. You will crash with a Blue screen of Death. The new anti copying technology actually crashes your pc unless you disable autoplay. This of course is not labeled anywhere!!! If you have data open on your computer it is gone!!!The music is terrible, overproduced and as there last three cds. Well Boring!"
1,"Utterly Pathetic! What's your deal, Dave?","I hear the single for ""American Baby"", and the first thing that came to mind was, ""Not a very good song at all, but it's different.... I still have good hopes for the album."" Well, upon listening to the album, I found that American Baby, is by far the best song on the album. Not saying very much for the album, when a mediocre song is tops.I listened to the album three times though, hoping the disc would grow on me. To no avail. This album is absolute garbage, and Dave Matthews should be ashamed of himself for putting out such trash. This album is right up there with Eminem's Encore album as the greatest disappointments of the 21st century in music thus far."
4,people need to give it some time.,"It is too early for anyone to be bashing this album, or to give it too much praise for that matter. some are quick to say,""oh, i hate it."" Give it more time than a few hours. A true album will take time to win you over. What if someone came to your place of employement or school and watched you for an hour. would you feel like you were given a fair chance? the answer should be no. Please people. do not bash too quickly. give it some time to soak in. I have listened to the album like 7 times on my ipod and still can't decide what i think. some of the strongs are terribly strong, others im not sure about yet. Give it some time, then post in a few days or weeks."
2,WOW!!!,Coming from DMB this is shocking. This is just plain bad. These songs just don't flow at all they're all over the map unlike his previous works which makes this more of a let down. I gave this cd 2 stars which represents the number of songs that are worth listening to and the $ that this cd should be worth.
5,Complete Satisfaction,CD was delivered in good time and in exactly the condition it was promised. I hope all my future online shopping experiences are as smooth and as satisfactory as this was.
1,This album is about as good as the last barney record,"But i think Barney might be better this this over rated jam band. Who cares about Dave Matthews its 2005 WHO CARES!!!!! About this guy. This is truely horrible. This is more evil the Myotismon, The Dark masters and other evil Digimon. Guess im gonna go back and listen to System Of A Down Or The Gorillaz."
1,"Terrible, a Joke","I just bought this CD and i cant even listen to it, becuase its copyright protected? Is this some kind of a joke? I guess this is what i get for buying a CD... Ill be downloading every CD from now on if I cant load it onto my ipod.And outside of that the music isnt DMB.I dont know what it is.I do know that iam selling my tickets to his concert this summer"
2,"a cd that sounds like a boring pop group, not dmb!","Firstly, I would like to say that I have been an intense dmb listener for a good while now. They have defiantly become my favorite band in the time since I have been introduced to them. I must say I am very disappointed with this new album. Dmb is great because their music grows and changes within a song. Stand up has several songs which seem static. Most of the songs are extremely repetitive which almost makes them annoying. The drum parts are extremely boring in many places which is sad because Carter (the drummer) is so gifted. There are a few good songs, dreamgirl and hello again. Overall this album does not sound like the complex dmb that I have grown to love. It sounds like a cd made by an average boring pop group on the radio."
3,"DMB still my favorite, but they took a hit with this one...","I know lots of the reviews here are super long and all you guys dont want to raed all 200+ of them, so ill get right to my point...In my eyes, DMB is one of the greatest bands for their instrumental capabilities. In this album Carter (drummer), one of the great drummers of this era, was reduced to multiple 4/4 rock beats instead of his signature grooves. The unique violin/sax embelishments were missing.I love DMB, but this would NOT be the album I would give people who want to be introduced to the band."
2,"Interesting sound, but not for this listener","A startling departure into a different direction, this new CD takes getting used to. Unfortunately for this listener it doesn't work. It sounds heavier and darker than earlier DMB; even Dave's vocals sound subdued. There was nothing here that made me think 'wow, impressive'. I've always appreciated DMB's music with their introspective and enlightening lyrics without any 'hard sell' of their viewpoint, but there's not much of that earlier Dave here. It's pretty heavy-handed in sound and production.Dave made a comment during a performance on MTV of music from his solo effort that there were things he wanted to try for a while but they didn't work with his band, hence the solo album. Maybe he's trying something new, because we all know that you either grow together or you grow apart. I respect that they take these chances, as long as tomorrow they don't say goodbye."
5,"nothing new, just a new approach","For everyone else who is tired of repeatitive live albums that just keep adding more discs, this new studio album is a breath of fresh air. This albums takes familiar DMB twists in a new direction. By far their best album since ""Before these crowded streets"", just give it a few listens. This album is a return to the full band sound lost on ""busted stuff"". Shell out the $15 bucks... you'll be glad you did."
3,Very Average,Like a lot of other fans I was waiting in anticipation for the new DMD CD. I have listened to a few times and find it pretty average. Nothing really grabs you. I am sure I will like it more with more times listening. One BIG complaint I have with the Dual Disk is the CD side at times is very scratchy. Like a bad LP. Also with the copy protection trying to rip it into mp3's may not be possible. I returned this copy and have just the cd now which seems to be ok concerning the scratchy sound. I think music buyers should boycot cd's that don't allow you to convert them into mp's.
4,Well *I* liked it.,"What's with all the reviews complaining that the cd copyright protected? How about actually reviewing the *music* that's on the cd instead?Anyways, I'm glad that Dave Matthews is back and as good as ever. ""American Baby"" and ""Louisiana Bayou"" are the two best songs on the album. They're so catchy I'm listening to them over and over. I'm also glad that Dave and Co. have shortened their songs a bit. I mean, how many 9+ minute songs can you have? Thankfully Dave has the guts to try something a wee bit different."
1,"Wow, what really has happened?","Add this one to the other last two albums, which were also bad, and sounded like they were just checking a box on the ""to-do"" list. This one especially sounds (again) over produced and just lacked that special folk rhythm and smooth vocals that made DMB so great. I'm not sure you can even really hear Boyd on this album.I'm scared that the end is near for this band that definitely gave spice to the life of normal people in the 90's. They will always hold a place in my memories but they will not commandeer my wallet anymore.Sorry Dave..."
1,Worse DMB Album Ever Made,"I am about as hard-core Dave Matthews as you can get. I own every single album, dvd, and have a pretty big collection of bootlegs. My expectations for this release were not that high, given that Dave has been in a slump since Before These Crowded Streets (Everyday has its moments, but wasn't even in the same category as his previous albums), but what the heck was he thinking on this one? The only song that's even listenable is American Baby and it's not that good. Sorry to say, but the mish-mesh of leftovers from Busted Stuff is way better than anything this album even comes close to! Don't waste your money on this album. If you must listen to it out of curiosity, borrow it from someone you know that made the mistake of buying it."
1,Aweful,"This album is just aweful. After reading some of the posts I have to say that yes, Dave has been smoking for probably OVER 20 years which is why his voice sounds harsh. I completely agree that the band should stick with they're original producer, Steve Lillywhite, and finally try to bring the magic back from Under the Table and Dreaming. Since Everyday I have seen this band go down down down from they're orinal roots. I dont enjoy the new album. I also dont like the fact that they keep re-hashing all of these live albums they churn out year after year. Ever notice its mostly all the same songs just in different order? They are making a boatload of money so I'll give them that. Overall however this album is just God aweful."
2,Once upon a time....,"there was a great band that had a new fresh sound, that inspired, that was inspired, sounded optimistic, up-beat and was flat-out fun. With this CD, that is all in the past. Now, it seems, the political (?) cause over-shadows the music (the music presumably being the reason the band was formed). A group that has risen to the top because of what this awesome country has to offer now ironically and hypocritcally thinks they have a better way. Destitute, drab and pessimistic this music does little to inspire and is definately not fun. And for God's sake where have Carter's drums gone!?Too bad this CD wasn't dumped out the tour bus septic tank into the Chicago River with the rest of DMB's excrement."
2,Doesn't work in my cd player,"First point to consider...I am a major DMB fan, so giving this cd a 2-star rating was tough for me.A lot of frustration was delivered along with this dual cd. The audio side refused to play in any traditional equipment. I had to use my computer to play the audio. I work at my computer and have neither gigantor speakers nor the luxury of the mood to enjoy DMB. The music, to me, was not typical DMB so it went unnoticed. Amazon quickly and easily replaced my defective cd, however, the problems on the new cd were identical...no music on a traditional player.The video side played in my computer and the large portion I have seen is interesting; however, it is not something I would play over and over again like the MUSIC side. A little lacking in Dave himself, though.The only reason this cd got 2-stars is because it is DMB...otherwise it would have received a Zero!"
2,Saccharine Trust did it better,"There we go, Dave! Stickin' it to the man! I bet you didn't even care when you found out your new CD was going to be copy-protected. After all, you're probably one of those Bush-hating economic conservative hypocrites, you being so rich and all.My theory professor found some way to BURN (yes, illegally, cause I didn't wanna spend my cash on this crap) this CD for me (he's all about DMB for some reason) and told me I'd probably like it (I generally like fusion, jazz-rock, jazzcore, so on.)However, DMB is a pop band first and foremost; they're a hit-making machine led on a tight leash by some off-key drunkard named Dave St. Matthews or something like that.I can't wait for his band to kick him out and change their name to ""The Supremely Awesome Hercules-Riding-A-Motorcycle Jam Band"" and they'll do all sorts of cool stuff that makes us throw away our Phish records in shame of spending our time with lesser jam."
3,The music is good...,"I thoroughly enjoy this new sound. The only problem is that it's hard for me to enjoy it because of these new copyright protection features built into the disc. As much as I've loved DMB for all these years now, if I had known I wouldn't be able to throw the songs onto my iPod, I wouldn't have bought the cd."
2,Stand Up,Nothing like the DMB of old.DMB should go back to their old manager/arranger. I'll listen to my old DMB CD's and enjoy them.
3,"Collaborative album, lyrically challenged","Watching the DVD helped me understand and appreciate this album, but I still feel that this CD lacks the lyrical imagery and introspection seen in previous albums. The lyrics were created around the riffs, and the poetry of DMB was lost. This is a good album to pass the time during the summer, but won't last much beyond that in my humble opinion."
1,"Absolutely awful, don't buy it","I loved the Lillywhite studio albums (and Busted Stuff which we all know was Lillywhite) but Everyday was a joke and this album is a complete disaster. So disappointed.Where to begin? Bad song-writing and lyrics, none of those great cohesive jams they used to do, DM's voice is craggy, all kind of electronic experimental crap going on -- is that machine gun fire in the background?"
1,Beware! This CD will ruin your Windows computer!,"Sony has designed this CD so that if you want to play it on your PC you have to install some very poorly written software that will leave your computer vulnerable to viruses and hackers--and if you remove the software, you won't be able to use your CD drive at all! Check around the internet, there's a lot of talk about it."
1,"Dull, Lifeless, Boring, poorly done.","Being a fan of DMB, it is hard to say how disappointed I was with this most anticipated offering. A very poor recording of ""Everyday"" leftovers is all I could think. The music is routine and predictable. A couple of good moments, but not worth searching for. Mark Baston seems to forget he was working with a very talented, seasoned group of MUSICIANS!!!, not ""pop stars"" like 50 cent. Carter is one of the best drummers in the world (save for Neil Peart) and the drumming on this record is so weak I could play this material, and I am a guitar player!!! They are still the best live act around, but even a great song that was previewed on the last tour like ""Joyride"" was so washed down in production that it has no life and couldn't even make the album and is religated to the addition disc. And rightly so. Nice package, but empty inside. Where is Steve Lillywhite when you need him?"
5,Totally Different Totally Fresh Totally DMB,"LOVE IT!! After waiting so long for this album - definitely no disappointment at all. I have been a DMB fan since 1999 and they keep evolving - thank goodness. Really love Dreamgirl, Old Dirt Hill and Hunger for the Great Light - lyrics are very ""Dave"". Stefan plays electric guitar on Hunger and Carter is incredible throughout the album. It is a summery & happy sort of an album - very uplifting even with obvious policatal undertones. A must for DMB fans."
2,Mm...what happened?,"I respect DMB from where they came from and what they have created for us all over the years. The days of Under the Table and Dreaming, Crash, and the energy the songs had was incredible and moving. Now it seems as if they have steared in different directions and have got lost in the grievances in the world and lost the energy. Just kind of disappointing. I was hoping the energy would have come back on this one. Yes I'm a die hard fan and understand Dave's got some messages to get across but what about the good? Must be something positive to sing about. Well here's to dreaming. Like they say ""I'll go in this way and find my own way out."" Hope they find the energy and bring it back to us."
2,GTR video no English subtitles.,Good video as all best motoring usually are. This dose not have English subtitles. Wish I spoke or understood Japanese.
5,a great work,It is a great work of this book. I think it is very useful to readers with all kinds of levels. But it is a pity I can't buy it in my own country-mainland of China. Could you give me a chance? Thanks!
4,unfairly criticized but not for everyone,although some find the langorous pace unbearable and the characters flaky this movie reminded me of a lazy teenage summer with an ex-girlfriend and i was just completely captivated by the mood and atmosphere of the film... this movie is just about teenage love and the wonderful laziness and freedom of summer... the dream sequences are a little much though... anyways i think this film is underrated...
5,the perfect blend,classical meets bossa . mr bellinati is a master classical guitarist . then combine the genious of Jobim .....Brilliant !
1,sponge lover,The kids were so excited to get a spongebob sprinkler! We had to try to use it as soon as we got home. After 7 attempts to attach our garden hose I had to tell them to wait until dad got home and even then he couldn't get it to hook up. We returned spongebob and the kids were really disappointed!
1,JUNK!!! Save your money!!!,This product is a waste of time and money. Kids' were only able to use once. The only way to attach the hose was by using a plumber's wrench. It leaked like crazy. Could never get it attached after that!!! Do not buy!!!
1,Better off using the hose.....,It's great if you can get the thing to work. It wouldn't fit on the hose. Kept popping off the hose. Returned it. Will stick to a regular sprinkler from Home Depot.
1,horrible,There is no way to securely attach the sprinkler to a standard hose. Once the water is turned on the hose pops off the sprinkler.Complete waste of money
1,Who is this book for?,"I thought the author would assume that people buying this book already know the basics of web design and other common sense issues, such as knowing to ""proofread your resume"" (there actually was a section on this). Instead this book is completely book is completely basic and boring. I was hoping it would be really specific by giving advice such as how important it is to learn Java. Not sure who it was written for because who would buy a book about being a Webmaster if they didn't have a clue?"
1,"Simple, full of General Advice","This book is mostly full beginner advice that could be used by anyone just entering the professional job market. Very little content is Webmaster, IT specific, what is specific is rudimentary.I got this book from the Library, I am glad I did not have to pay anything for it, it provided me with zero information. I also checked out ""Web Design in a Nutshell"", published by O'Reilly, their books are infinitely more informative."
4,Good book for those wanting to know more about the field,"This is an excellent resource book for anyone entertaining the idea of becoming a Webmaster. It thoughtfully explorers the various requirements, job options, training tracks, etc."
5,Fast Shipping-excellent engraving A+++,Fastest shipping I have ever had! My rings were exactly as I ordered and the engraving was perfect! I shopped around and iwedding was definately the best deal and the smoothest part of my whole wedding planning. I ordered the brushed finish which givces the look of aluminum (I don't like the flashy) It was perfect!
4,My Spider Sense is Tingling...,"Although I am, for the most part, not fond of Tarantulas or any spiders, I do find them ""cool"". This movie was cool, and scary for a spider movie. This is so much more creepy to watch than that Eight Legged Freaks..., and the parts with the spider are devilishly good! Especially the ending is fun, where Jeff Daniels, who plays a doctor terrified of creepy-crawlies, battles the spiders. Truly scary spider effects there! I wish that I could tell you all of the pro's, but the bottom line is this: if you enjoy being scared by little creatures with eight legs and two fangs, this movie is good. If you are an arachnophobe, then you may never sleep another night in your life, so skip this movie! It will make you look differently at spiders from now on!"
4,Good spine tingler,"I really liked this movie. It will give you the creeps. Being female and afraid of anything with more than 2 legs...it was quite a coincidence that while my sister and I was watching this movie a huge hairy spider dropped down from the ceiling just as a spider in the movie was falling from the ceiling.(too real).. Now for the synopsis:A doctor moves into a small town to replace the retiring doctor. He has to win the confidence of the locals, but is confronted with a sudden outbreak of spider invasion, not knowing the spiders have set up a nice home in his barn."
4,"Wild, funny, and scarier than given credit","Huge killer spider from South America hitches a ride with a photographer's corpse to the United States, mates with a common female spider, and spawns a legion of small killer spiders that turn a peaceful little town upside down. Awesome roller coaster ride of a movie that gives you fears you never thought you could have. The best scene has to be when the spider drapes across the television set during FAMILY TIES."
3,FUN AND CREEPY! 3 1/2 STARS!,"This is a perfect starter for Halloween, just enough scares and fun to get you in the mood. 'Arachnophobia' would have been an even better film if it was scarier and funnier. It all seems pretty ""middle of the road"" to me. It's an enjoyable film unless you can't handle watching spiders, but it seems a bit uneven in tone. The DVD transfer is OK, but could be improved also. All in all, it's a good family horror movie, nothing too intense, but a lot of fun."
4,The Reason I Hate Spiders Even More!,"I have always hated spiders and this movie just fuels that hatred. Really creepy movie. This is one of the best movies I have seen dealing with spiders. It creeps me out to see all of the places spiders can hide. I think about this movie every time I take a shower and everytime I turn on a lamp. One of the best horror movies I have ever seen, no other movie has had it's effect on me as much this movie did."
3,Cheesy and forgettable,"The Bottom Line:This cheesy ""thrill-omedy,"" to use its own marketing term, may work its less-than considerable charms on those who possess the titular fear of spiders, but to those of us who don't find spiders inherently terrifying and don't find John Goodman inherently hilarious it's an underwhelming movie that doesn't warrant any time or money; look elsewhere.2.5/4"
1,Wrong region,"Unfortunately this DVD does not play in Ireland, the display says ""wrong region"" , the DVD is perfect but not for Ireland , I could not return it as I opened the DVD packaging in order to play it . Was a bit sad as this was my first order from amazon and me and the kids were so excited to see the movie and only realised very last minute as we all sat on the sofa :("
4,An Alright movie,I saw this on AMC and I can say it is not bad for a spider movie (many spider movies are not that good). The ending dosen't fit that well though. It would have been better if they had ended it right when they rejoiced about killing all the spiders and not the ending in San Fransisco. It almost felt like I was watching two movies. Do you catch my drift.
2,Generally unwatchable,Promising story becomes rediculous after the first half-hour. The directing by Frank Marshall could have been a bit more thoughtful.Let's not forget the man made Congo. If that doesn't give away the film's quality I don't know what does. Only redeeming Quality is John Goodman.
4,Spiders With a Lethal Bite!,"This blu-ray was good and entertaining. If you are deathly afraid of spiders I would not recommend you this movie. I however really like this movie and I'm very satisfied by it. These spiders make the rest of spiders little whimps. One bite that can kill you in a few seconds and the head spider is huge. The acting in this movie was really good the spider special effects was really good. The only average part in my opinion was the sound, you can understand what they are saying but it could be more clear. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good bug or spider thriller and give it a B-."
4,"Good, creepy entertainment","This was a good movie. Creepy in the right way. Doesn't quite do to spiders what Jaws did with sharks, but worth the viewing.On a side note, I can't believe the moron who complained about the killing of spiders in this movie. Pal, life must be pretty boring for you."
4,Frank Marshall's best directed film.,This is a very good movie.I live in house full of spiders. This movie makes you think twice about that harmless spider crawling across your floor right now.The movie takes a little while to get going and has a anoying charactor but it makes up for it. John Goodman is great in it. It is very underated. Watch it!
5,Arachnophobia is Great !,"Arachnophobia delivers both chills and laughs. In this movie, a race of deadly spiders get loose in a small town and start biting the townspeople at alarming rates. All spider haters, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Great Fun. Jeff Daniels is terrific."
5,THREE THUMBS UP!,"The way the leporous woman got rrid of the Indians was worth the whole price of the book. I'll be tarred and feathered by my Texas wife and all ourr friends for saying this, but it did my New Mexico heart good to see a bunch of Texans get what was coming to them! As they say, Poor New Mexico, so far from Heaven and so close to Texas. I'm brave enough to write my name, Luther Butler, e-mail me if you care"
2,Not even close...,"McMurtry didn't even try very hard to show us the young Rangers. The characters are flat, and some of the dialogue is witless. Save your money."
3,Depressing !,"By far, .......the MOST depressing book I've ever read! Couldn't there have been at least one or two good things to happen? Maybe I should have read Lonesome Dove first. Well, . . . I'm working on it now."
2,McMurtry's Heart Wasn't in This One,"While this is a story that has its moments, somehow it isn't up to the standard one expects of Larry McMurtry. I get the impression that this was one he thought he ought to write, rather than being one he wanted to write. The story has too many loose ends, and too many characters that are just there so that they can die before the end of the story - hence the title. Skip this one and go straight to Lonesome Dove."
2,The worst and most implausible ending ever written.,"I give it two stars for the humorous exchanges of Gus and Call, but I was sorely disappointed in the plot, and the ending was enough to make me swear off McMurtry for good. Where he got such a group of stupid and hackneyed characters as the Lady and her entourage I'll never know."
3,Western or science fiction?,"I found the first three-fourths of this book fairly captivating, however, at that point it took a really strange turn. Upon arriving in San Lazaro, the story really lost something and these last few chapters of the novel just didn't fit in with the flow of the story. It's almost as if the author got bored and simply let someone else finish the book for him.A minor problem I had with this book was the way in which insignificant characters were killed off. Gus and Call start off on the main adventure with over 200 people, and the author almost immediately starts widdling down the party to a managable level. Near the end, the ways in which people die becomes less and less believable. And when you consider the odds of both Gus and Call surviving when hundreds around them die, it's pretty unrealistic.The majority of the book is quite good. I would have given this 4 or 4.5 stars if a more palatable ending could have been conceived."
3,Good Western for people who don't like Westerns,The first Western I've probably ever read (I don't think Little House on the Prairie counts). It was pretty good; I liked the characters. I might read more of the Lonesome Dove series if I come across them.
4,"Excellent! Smooth reading, enticing characters.","Sure, nothing can rival Lonesome Dove or Terms Of Endearment, yet, anyway. But this book is so smooth. An easy read that gives you a good feel for what got Call & McCrea started. I loved it, and would love to see some more tales of our two heroes in their younger years! Thanks Larry, a good escape! I'll pass it on."
3,"Dead Man's Walk, Reading Man's Hassle","This is the first episode in the lives of Call and Gus. It was intended to tell those who loved Lonesome Doves how the duo met, and what forged their friendship. That was the intent. What happens in this book, though, is that you exposed too much effort to explain things we already know from previously published books. There are just too many attempts to explain things that just popped up in the Lonesome Dove. I mean all that was missing was some attempt to include Laurie's parents. Well written, but very boring and tedious at points."
3,not as good as lonesome dove,"I read fantasy but lonesome dove was a great book, this book was to slow paced for my liking. The hole book takes place in about 4 months."
5,Great Tale of Gus's and Call's Early Adventures!,"Exciting, interesting and great read setting the tone for the characters and personalities of two young Texas rangers who will become our friends as we follow them as maturing adults in later books. Realistic adventures and gripping moments!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Four"
2,No lonesome dove,"First of all let me say I loved 'Lonesome Dove'. Loved it. Loved the story, loved the characters, and consider it a classic. Regrettably this isn't in the same league. Most of the dialogue is so stupid it insults the intelligence and the characters seemed cartoonish at best. In fact the whole book felt like a comic book. I found myself skimming over pages until I just couldn't take it any more. At page 310 I skipped to the end, an ending which ranks as one of the dumbest endings I've ever encountered in fiction. I gave it two stars because I did get 300 pages in before calling it quits."
3,No Lonesome Dove,Lonesome Dove is one of the best books I've ever read but Dead's Man Walk can't hold a candle to it. The Rangers are portrayed as bumbling idiots who are captured or ambushed as easily as picking up a baby. I especially didn't like the ending. I thought Call and Gus would have it out with Buffalo Hump but not to be (I won't spoil the ending). It's still a good read but it's no Lonesome Dove or Streets of Laredo (an excellent read!!). If you find it at a garage sale or thrift store for a cheap price then by all means pick it up.
5,Great book!,"I thought this book was great. McMurtry is an obviously talented storyteller due to his ability to transport the reader into the world of Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae. Great characters, sharp witty dialog in the Clara Forsythe scenes (ya gotta love her!) and pretty much stunning, shocking scenes of very descriptive, graphic violence in the torturing scenes. I think I will get through these four books with no problem. I'm reading the second installment in this series(which would be ""Comanche Moon""- not in the order they were written, but according to the ages of Gus and Woodrow) and I am finding it very hard to put down, too. It's a pity these books are rather bulky. Once I finish them I will wish I hadn't done so...that's the only bad part I can see so far. Other than that, congratulations Mr McMurtry. I speak on behalf of my father and I when I say that!"
3,Larry rocks but...,This book was a disappointment after Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo. The characters just weren't that engaging.
3,Poor Prequel,"I went into this book hoping that it would be as good as Lonesome Dove. To my horror, I found it too simple, boring, and all-in-all mediocre. The book did not delve into the character's emotions and had many useless characters: example: Gomez. A must read for fans, but not as good, don't expet much."
3,Let's get it over with.,"This book falls short of Lonesome Dove standards and seems to have been written in a hurry. Brutality and gore are used wantonly to create sensationalism and to the point that the story lacks reality. In spite of all that, it grabs the readers attention and keeps you looking ahead to see what is going to happen next. It is worthwhile.SocksMarty's MomMister MartyMarty's Town"
3,Brutal Prequel To Lonesome Dove,"The first adventure of Western heroes Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, whose later life story was immortalised in LONESOME DOVE. A very readable novel that reflects the brutally of that time and place, even if it is somewhat unpolitically correct with its use of Indian villains. Apart from the two known characters, the novel is full of strong characters who breath life into this remarkable and entertaining book. Powerful and well worth reading, it is only let down by the rather weak and silly ending which all too obviously sets itself up for further adventures - no problem with that, it's just a shame it had to detract from the power of most of what had gone before."
2,"A rushed, contrived money-spinner.","After the amazing Lonesome Dove and the rather good sequel, Streets of Laredo, McMurtry hits us with a book that simply doesn't make the grade. It reeks of his editor saying, ""You have got to write another book this year, why don't you use those two rangers again?"". The book starts quite well, with some gritty scenes but quickly goes downhill from there, ending with one of the most ridiculously contrived endings I have ever had the misfortune to read. Not even, McMurtry's often brilliant style can save this book. Symptoms of the book being rushed are everywhere (e.g. Saying that McCrae is Scottish when in Lonesome Dove they comment on Call's Scottish roots).All in all, a total disappointment."
3,Not as good as Lonesome Dove...,"It's interesting to see how the characters started out and I'll be reading Comanche Moon soon, but I didn't feel this novel had the brilliance of Lonesome Dove. Still, McMurtry is fun reading and I enjoyed the story once I got into it."
2,Dead Man's Walk - a review,"Woodrow Call and Agustus McCrae are very young men, just embarking on their adventures as Texas Rangers when this book takes place. I have to admit it was rather a disappointment. ""Lonesome Dove"" is a masterpiece and, in a way, I think McMurty should have left it at that. He uses the central characters from ""Lonesome Dove"" in ""Dead Man's Walk"", and, especially in regard to Woodrow Call, it just doen't ring true. I just can't see Captain Call of LD as the same Woodrow Call in DMW, particularly when it comes to his relationship with Maggie. Captain Call was a solitary individual,emotionally remote. I don't see this struggle in DMW, or any reason for him to turn inward later in life and to deny his son. The ending of the book seems rather abrubt and far-fetched. If you can separate the idea that these are the same characters from LD, you may enjoy the book on that level. As westerns go, it is an okay read."
3,Walking with Gus and Woodrow,"This book strikes me as closer in tone to Lonesome Dove than McMurtrey's earlier sequel, Streets of Laredo. There is alot of violence and gore, but alot of humor too. We see Call and McCrae meet and join the Rangers together and follow their first, hapless adventures through Southern Texas and Mexico.It is nice to see Gus McCrae alive again after Woodrow Call had to ride alone through Streets of Laredo. Of course, this book is not nearly the work of Art that Lonesome Dove was, but if you are following the series, you wont want to miss this installment."
5,Great Entertainment,"This book may not have been as great as Lonesome Dove, but it was just about as entertaining. From beginning to end, i was totally enraptured. Regardless of some contrived episodes, the Indians and Rangers were fascinating. Perhaps my 5-star rating is overblown due to my inexperience reading Westerns (it's only my 2nd, after Lonesome Dove). But it was a great read. I loved every minute of it."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"Like many others, I read Dead Man's Walk after I read Lonesome Dove. I picked up Dead Man's Walk to read about Gus & Call as young men. The story itself was interesting, but the character development was definitely lacking. I was disappointed that they were so one dimensional, Gus is always scheming for a poke and Call never lets his hair down. If this were my introduction to the series, I would not have read the next book - Comanche Moon."
3,A grisly Western,"Yow! This book was gritty and grusome. It still makes me shudder to think of some of the stuff written in it's pages! It's story is a continution (a prequel rather) of the Lonesome Dove series, and it's heroes are Woodrow Call and Gus McCray. This is an ""early years"" type story, and tells about how the two friends first joined the Rangers. The book details the failed missions of the novice Ranger troop. The one thing that bothered me about their adventures, however, was the fact that no matter where they were; out in the desert with no water or food; in a town of lepers; or even in the middle of a swift running river, it was never the elements of the harshness of the situation that caused them trouble: It was always a lurking band of Indians. They didn't have to worry about dying in the hot, hot desert. They had to worry about getting killed by a Indian who was tracking them in the desert. It just wasn't realistic. Lonesome Dove had a better story"
2,"This is not the same person that wrote ""Lonesome Dove!""","I finished this book only because I had started it and somehow expected it to improve down the line. After reading ""Lonesome Dove"" I had expected a read at least approaching that of the original of the series. What a disappointment. The writing is almost amateurish. I do not believe L.M. wrote this book, but he obviously put his name on it. Buy at your own risk!"
3,Schlock of the Highest Order,"""Dead Man's Walk"" was my introduction to Pulitzer-Prize winning hack, Larry McMurtry's fiction. A book written in the ""what happens next"" style of schlocky fiction, much like the Hardy Boys series, like the latter, it is nonetheless hard to put down. Taken for what it's worth, it's a real page-turner that reads easily, makes little, if any, demands on the reader, and provides the same kind of cheap thrills as a Grade B horror movie, or a well-put-together haunted house in an amusement park. There is much more substantial western fiction out there, written by writers with a surer hand, but this book packs its considerable weight in cheap thrills, and offers, as is often said about other western hacks, Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour, a ripping good (if often lamely predictable) yarn."
1,Why not call it the story of two Jobs?,"I thought that this book (which I unfortunately read to the end) was incredibly contrived, and basically just plain stupid. Two young Texas Rangers manage, with no recognizable skills, to survive Indians, floods, fires, wild animals, and the Mexican army. But, of course, they had to survive, since the books that chronicle their later years were already written.So you know what's going to happen, even though much wilier and skilled men, actually, about two or three hundred others, manage to fall victim to various calamities. Just plain stoopid! Everything that happens to our two ""heroes"" is bad - everything. It's one sad, miserable, gruesome event after another. It never lets up, yet, in the last few pages, they're saved in a totally unbelievable, Deus ex Machina ending. I'm so mad at myself for reading to the end that I could spit."
2,Fear of a punk planet,i bought this dvd because it had NOFX on the cover. the movie is a cheasy story line with hardly any nofx influence. i never got into the movie because i was just looking for nofx entertainment. it seems to be a really low budget mtv teenage movie.
4,C'est bonne musique,"Allo, J'avais de la chance ecouter Habib Koite en concert et je suis hereux. Il etait tres gentil et j'aime quand il joue le guitar. J'ecris en francais car je sais qu'il n y aura pas beaucoup des anglophones qui vont le lire. Je suis certain que si vous aimez la musique de l'Afrique-Ouest, vous aimerez cette aussi. Les musiciens jouent si surprenant ensemble et malheuresment les musiciens africaines ne jouent pas assez en Colorado. Les griots sont de grandes musiciens et modestes aussi; quand j'ai dit ""je vais jamais oublier cette concert, Habib"", il a repondu ""c'est vrai? tu es trop gentil"". Il vaut le peine d'acheter."
1,Please read,"One look at the price tag, and you think you were buying the second coming of Jesus on CD.This is sold in itunes for a reasonable price."
5,The music is beautiful and unique,I love all different types of music and was so excited when I heard Habib Koite's music. I had to buy the CD and was not dissapointed. Every track on this CD was great. There's a mixture of different sounds and rhythms that move the soul. Very soulful and from the heart. I highly recommend it.
4,Great new artist,A unique sound that will keep you entertained and wanting more! I've had my copy of Ms. Black's CD for years and am glad to see it will now be available on Amazon.com.
5,Jello Biafra America's Most Dangerous Frontman,"Here are the DK's again in a series of singles and B-sides which highlight their ferocity as a hard rocking band to hit you and run like a small guerrilla unit using lyrics, bass, guitar, drums, sarcasm and satire, instead of guns and grenades. GMC or GMD never gets old, again another one by the DK's which has been in my collection in every format over the past 20 years!"
4,Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death a revew by a fan,hey if ur reading this then u must like dk! this is a great cd of some of there best songs(Police truk)but dosent have them all(nazzi punks f**k off)but it dose have most. i recomend this to fans of punk or just dk(if ur a real fan youd have it already!).
2,Not worth the money,"Sometimes, after a band has broken up, it's possible to put together one last good album from unreleased material. For example, Sublime's ""Second Hand Smoke"", which stands on the same level as their other albums. This isn't the case with the Dead Kennedys. Its easy to see why most of the songs on this album weren't used on any other albums. There are two exceptions-""Police truck"" and ""Pull my strings"". If you want these songs, get them from Napster or something. The album does contain two DK's classics- ""California Uber Alles"" and ""Holiday in Cambodia"", but if you want these songs, get them on ""Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables"", which contains a lot of other good songs. Anyway, this version of ""California Uber Alles"" isn't as good. If you want some good DK's music, buy ""Fresh Fruit"", ""Bedtime for Democracy"" or ""Plastic Surgery Disasters/In God we Trust Inc."""
1,never got it,I never got my cd. the seller said she was looking for another copy or a refund but I have yet to receive either
3,Almost worth it for one song,"Maybe there are some gems I haven't discovered, but the versions of ""Holiday In Cambodia"" and ""California Uber Alles"" are honestly inferior to the originals on ""Fresh Fruit.""But ""Pull My Strings""... I won't repeat the whole story, but this is a first-class (serious) punk prank that rivals Crass releasing ""Our Wedding"" as a flexidisk to a teenage girls' magazine. The song was performed live, at the Bay Area Music Awards, without warning (or permission) in place of their rehearsed number, to the very crowd the song attacks. Jello claims that Francis Ford Coppola was so incensed that backstage afterward he shoved their drummer against a wall in passing.""When I get rich/And meet Bob Hope/We'll shoot some golf/And shoot some dope....""They were not invited back the following year.So, as a slice of history, that song alone nearly makes the whole CD worth it. The rest... well, listen to the samples and decide."
4,This Album is my 3'rd favorite of DK,"Gimme Convienience was the first album I got of them, although I had every song on MP3. DK is no doubt the greatest punk band that has and ever will grace the now defunct 'scene'. This album is more of a compilation of various songs that they either scratched in the past or songs of various significance to the people who compiled it. I think this is my 3rd favorite because Fresh Fruit and Plastic Surgery Disasters are such incredible works, worthy in my mind of being the top two albums that I've ever heard. It's too bad that the members of DK are now engaged in a court battle, mainly Ray and co. against Biafra for alleged non payment from Biafra's label alternative tentacles.. or so I think that's case. I wish Biafra could find a new way to surface these days; He's such a dynamic guy. His spoken word stuff is somewhat disheartening I must admit, but hey, you've gotta make a living. Anyhow, this album's a buy, it's got some good songs."
4,dynamic punk rock,"A friend gave me this tape and after the 1st listen I was blown away. I seem to remember a heavy metal band covered ""Holiday in Cambodia""---but the Kennedy's version is far better. Other kewl tracks are ""Police Truck"" and ""California Uber Alles"". Too bad Jello didn't win the mayor's race in San Francisco."
4,"Not as great as the first studio albums, but good anyways","Some songs on this album, while good to own, are really not all that great, only foreshadowing the greatness the Kennedys (and even more so Jello) would go on to acheive. Both songs written by Sixty Twenty Five, ""Short Songs"" and ""Strait A's"", aren't up to the level of Biafra's. However, the original single versions of the songs ""California Uber Alles"" and ""Holiday In Cambodia"" manage to be better than the versions heard on ""Fresh Fruit"". ""Police Truck"", ""Too Drunk to F-ck"", ""Pull My Strings"", ""I Fought the Law"", and ""Night of the Living Rednecks"" (the earliest recorded Jello spoken word peice) are great tracks, making this a great buy for DK fans. While some of the tracks aren't the best in the discography, they are good to have in your collection anyways."
4,Dead Kennedys 2nd best,"Yo this was my first purchase of the new re-issues of the old dk stuff and it's as great as it was when i first heard it. I at first had only heard there stuff on my dads old record player . At first i thought there stuff was mindless (sorry) but listened to it more and learned to love it. Its the same way with this album. When i bought it i was expecting stuff as good as Plastic SURGERY DISASTERS , plus this has HOLIDAY IN CANMBODIA and CALIFORNIA UBER ALLES the hardcore fan favorites but at first it sounded of lower quality than there other stuff but after a while i learned that this IS some of there best stuff and all around it deserves a purchase.But buy PLASTIC SURGERY DISASTERS first."
2,Too Drunk for Convenience,"A half-hearted attempt. Fine with ""Police Truck"" and ""Too Drunk,"" but the alternative version of ""Holiday in Cambodia"" doesn't rank with the one from Fresh Fruit. Stick with Fresh Fruit, it's better top to bottom."
4,To L. Scott:,"You call yourself a REAL punk, but do you even know who the SEX PISTOLS ARE??? I was there, in those mosh pits! So, you have no right to say what punk is and isn't. As for this CD, GREEN DAY is more hardcore than this!!! Is this punk? Yes. Harcore? Hardly. Not the greatest band, but a solid one. If you want REAL hardcore, check out:ADOLESCENTSBLACK FLAGSLAPPY-GREEN DAY"
1,"Horrible album, horrible band. More D.K. crap","So i have tried to give them a shot on more than one occasion but anytime i hear the vocals all i can picture is Katherine Hepburn with a microphone. But singing (un)talent aside, lyrically it isnt much better. Political songs are the easiest to write as long as you have an opinion, and the lyrics to any Dead Kennedy song can be written by a 16 year old boy who watches CNN and has an ego. Jello Biafra isnt some great punk rock frontman like all the kids at hot topic wearing their DK shirts believe he is, he's just another guy with an opinion about issues with a bad voice. Horrible album, horrible band"
5,Anti-Republican punk heaven,I love this album. Dk is probably one of the greatest punk bands of all time. There is a wide range of songs from fast to funny to hardcore. This is a must for any punk fan of any age.
2,Not a Bad Book,"This book does not have music, just words and chords. The Bluegrass Fakebook has all the same songs plus the music score, which is helpful in learning the tunes."
2,Musical notation is inadequte,"This book has a nice array of basic Bluegrass songs but the notation is challenging. The tab is all written for the 2nd, 3rd, & 4th strings of guitar and has very little guidance on time; that is what time values should be assigned to each note. If one is familiar with the song he can apply the time values that he knows. If the song is unfamiliar, too much is left to ones imagination. There is no standard music notation which would have solved the problem."
1,Not for Mandolin/Fiddle Players,"This book does not use traditional musical notation (staff and notes) or guitar tablature. It only give notation with three strings to be read by a guitar or banjo player. I play mandolin with a trio (guitar/banjo/mando) and for me it is completely useless. I would have given a better review, except nothing in the product description indicates that it is is only for guitar and banjo players."
4,bluegrass book,"It's written for singers because the words for every song are included. However, it also has the chords and very basic tab to play along with."
5,bluegrass resource,great source for bluegrass music. found the words and music for those familiar songs heard at jams.
4,IF I WERE A RICH MAN,"This is an interesting documentary whose effects are still being felt and whose ending has not yet been written. The movie concentrates on the illegal influence peddling and money laundering of Jack Abramoff, an ideological Republican. It starts with his college days which also shows clips of Karl Rove and Ralph Reed as a college student. While the film mentions Rove by name, it never connects him to any wrong doing. Rove's film is called ""Bush's Brain.""The film interjects classic movie footage into the documentary, aka Michael Moore style, but fails to achieve the humor of a Moore film, nor does it grip you like one of his films. The musical score was hit and miss. The production needed better editing and shortening.The problem of campaign financing is that it has evolved into an overt form of legalized bribery. It is still with us today. Until this is changed our Republic is in peril to well financed special interest groups.Occasional F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
5,The depressing and pathetic state of American politics.,"If this were watched as a fictional piece, one would surely think that the author had truly ""gone off the rails"" in imagining such vile and consciousless characters being so deeply influential and so closely connected to the highest echelons of the US government...just not possible!! Every eligible voter should be required to see this before voting for any elected official. Democracy is doomed unless someone in government has the guts to demand election reform and to get rid of the lobbyists as they presently operate."
4,People are the best part of nature,"I got into Michael Franti about fifteen years ago with The Disposable Heros Of Hiphopracy... You hear the youth of a few of their songs on here, and as great as Disposable Heros were, this album does well to stand for itself!"
5,Great book,"Excellent resource for clinicians, correctional administrators, and as an upper level textbook. Covers the field extensively, from many perspectives. The editors clearly have experience in the field."
2,Misstep,"Disjointed mess about fear of aging and of failure. The improvisations here never work. A performance within a performance is very tricky to do well. ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Being Julia"" had the same flaw of arrogantly presuming a movie audience would be impressed with this too clever device. A real life married couple should never act together unless they have a much better script."
1,"Cheap knockoff of an excellent, working tool","I used to have a very similar tool, that I relied on for many years, and eventually lost, and sought to replace. This excuse for a good tool not only dulled instantly, but actually fell apart when the center rivet failed. This tool is actually in pieces on my bench, after very little use. Do not buy."
3,Be aware there is 'animated' nudity,"I purchased this DVD for my 11 year old son. We have played all of the games together and really enjoy them , and are looking forward to Tomb 6. However, there was no mention in any of the reviews of the nudity. What does that have to do with the game, or the creation of Lara Croft? This DVD could have received 4 or maybe even 5 stars if that segment was left out. I expected Lara's 'size' to be mentioned, NOT pictured. A mention of this on the box or even here would have prepared us, or maybe I wouldn't even have bought it."
5,Thought provoking analysis of prison effectiveness,"Jessica Mitford gives an in depth analysis of how prisons function in society. She reviews the state of literature at the time. Most interesting was a study in which they hired people to pretend they were in prison for a month and others to act as guards. The study had to be disbanded early because of the extreme psychological impact on both ""prisoners"" and ""guards."" Chilling!Oh yes! The title! If it is legal punishment under the constitution it must be ""Kind and Usual"" because the other kind is unconstitutional."
4,Watch out for the binding,"Maybe I'm quibbling, but I feel like I should warn prospective buyers that the binding on the hardcover version of this book is totally insufficient for its size and length. I'm only 200 pages in (so my rating isn't wholly meaningful, but it's required in order to post a review), and the binding is cracking and the book feels as if it's ready to fall apart. The content is great so far, but the prospective buyer should be forewarned."
5,I loved the whole series,"I loved the whole series and I thought this was an awesome finish. You will probably like Stephen R. Lawhead's ""The Song of Albion"" series as well. I just love these English folk lore stories for some reason."
4,the final chapter,"This is the final book of the Lyonese trilogy. It was not as good as the other two, but still and all, a good read. It tied up a lot of the loose ends and was full of sorcerers and magic. Great for the fantasy enthusiast"
4,Almost up to speed,"They've really nailed it ... best exercise program I've ever tried (if you count years of modern dance, Pilates, yoga, aerobics, jazzercise, Tae-bo, Lotte Berke, etc.). Although the blond is a bit gamey sometimes, after you finish one of their workouts you feel great: integrated, serene, and accomplished. I'd recommend starting with the basic program before entering this Master series, but then, all bets are off. Enjoy!"
5,Don't like excercise LOVe this,I don't generally like excercise routines or look forward to excercising...but I LOVE the YBB workouts. They make me forget that I am working out and I actually look forward to the routines.
2,Solely a tool to sale his weekend workshops...,"Indeed you get some info and some nice ideas / motivation, but the core of the book is for you to subscribe to his workshops. I would recommend intead the following books: Unofficial Guide the to Real Estate Investing or Investing in Real Estate. Both books were excellent with great tips and I took several notes.Any book you read will give you some tips and ideas so every single book is good to a certain extent, but given a limited time frame I would focus on the best ones. Good luck with your career in Real Estate Investing:)"
2,"Details career, lacks in-depth personal info","I found David Fury's book "" Man Behind the Rifle"" a disappointment. I am a huge fan of Chuck Connors, and have been since childhood, back in the early 60's. This book is almost totally about his career, as opposed to his personal life, which the title implies. Mr. Fury obviously spent a lot of time on research, but took the wrong direction. Chuck Connors childhood was skimmed over, especially his obscure relationship with his father. No picture of Chuck's dad or sister were included. It seemed more like a list of productions he had been in, rather than his life. I hope someone close to Chuck Connors tries to write a more intimate story about him in the future."
5,A Thorough and Entertaining Biography,"David Fury's biography of Chuck Connors provides a thorough and entertaining view of Connors work, not only as a tv and film personality, but a sports figure as well. I was familiar with Connors tv and film work but not his role in sports - and not just one sport but two - basketball and baseball. Connors turned out to be a very versatile, but humble, individual who seemed to enjoy his fans, be they film or sports fans. The book provides a thorough review of Connors' life and contains one of the best things any biography can have - interviews and comments by those who actually knew and worked with Connors. These are essential in any biography and Fury's work contains tons of quotes which give the book thorough credentials. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Chuck Connors."
5,Great story and worthwhile read,"We are big rifleman fans and watch it everyday. I was interested in Chuck Connors life and this book took you from a small boy through the day he died. I learned so much about him and what he did for others. He was an amazing man. The book kept you interested and wanting to read more. It could have gotten a little more into his life with his family and less on all the movies he did, not that I didn't want to know about the movies but they kind of explained each movie and they wouldn't have had to go into such detail. Overall it was a great book and well worth reading."
3,"Nice to get if you're a ""Rifleman"" fan!","I found this book to be interesting reading about the career of Kevin ""Chuck"" Joseph Connors, from his basketball and baseball days to movies and television. I don't mind the lack of info on his personal life, since I want to rememeber the man I knew from ""The Rifleman,"" ""Arrest and Trial,"" ""Branded"" and ""Cowboy in Africa"". Fury deserves credit for his attempt and perseverance in writing the book. The photos also added color to the career details. My money has not been spent in vain!"
4,CHILLING STORY,"This murder happened in my community. It was widely reported and discussed, but I learned so much more from reading the book. It was well written and will keep a reader's interest."
5,Very useful,"I am a therapist and work with many children who have ADHD and/or learning challenges. My daughter is an elementary school teacher. I bought this book for both of us to use. It has simple ideas about how to help children do better in school and improve behavior. This is often overlooked. Great resource!Melody King, L.C.S.W."
1,Absolutly Horrible,"I picked up the ""value collection"" while on a road trip having already read most of the first book. I did not notice the Abridgment note in very small print on the back...Right away I knew I hated the reader, he was god awful. But to make matters worse, I got about half way through the second CD. The Abridgment was so horrible that I actually thought I skipped a whole CD... WTF? I spent 10 minutes going back through the chapters trying to figure out what happen to my book.It really does suck that bad. I just threw out the whole thing when I got home because the book store wouldn't take it back. Save your self and don't buy this Abridgment."
3,Bourne Collection,"I was disappointed that the books were not complete. I read the books a long time ago and wanted to re-read them. Since I don't have the books any longer, I ordered the audio books. I noticed that quite a bit of details were missing. They should clearly indicate that the audio is not complete.Other than that, the reader is good (Darrin McGavin) and the CD quality is good.Are there complete readings available?"
3,Nothing like the movies,"I am one of those Ludlum fans after seeing the three Bourne movies. other than some names and basic storyline, the books are nothing like the movie. I thought I could hop right into the next book written by someone else, and people that die in the movie are alive in the book...they were enemies in the movie and friends in the book. So I went back and wanted to do the audiobook thing and catch up on the story line in the books... this was helpful but remember it is an audiobook. the unabridged version of book 4 is longer then the unabridged version of these 3 put together.If you have no problems with abridged audiobooks and like Ludlum and the Bourne story, you'll like this. You'll also like the Bourne Betrayl, Legacy, and Sanction (haven't read/listened to the new one...the Deception!!)"
2,Powerstar RBC18 6V 7.5AH,"The battery is bare battery, It is also under powered APC battery replacement is a 6V 9 Amp Hours but this offering is 7.5 Amp Hours only. In addition it does not have the fuse and connectors you would need unless you pry it off the old batteries. They should revise the listing and put a note stating that it does not come with fuse and the cables"
1,This story was first written by the brothers Grimm.,"The story I read by the brothers Grim is a highly intricate tale revealing a profound problem, viz., that of identity crises, but written as a fairy tale it is a wonderful story which captivates the imagination of pre-teenagers, in the telling of it. The old witch involved in it was named Krauterweis, and not ""Herbwise"". I suspect that your book is a poor, adulterated copy of the elegant work I read so many years ago."
4,"Soft, but no pockets","These pants are a great length for teenagers, a nice surprise since I somehow missed ""youth"" in the title and bought these for an adult. They are a soft material and the print is exactly as shown; however, they don't have pockets or a draw string, since they are styled more for young boys than for teens..."
1,Changing table,"The table was damaged, scratched and not good.Many scratches,when unpacked, packaging tie was broken a holein the cardboard, but scratches throughout."
4,Great for the price and the purpose,"I won't pay $150 for this, but for $70 it's great. It will do the intended job. The size is perfect and the design is functional. I like the shelf and most of all the bin. Yes, it is not the greatest quality but what is these days. I did not expect anything more for the price I paid. I think it will hold up just fine. The color is a little darker than expected, but it's no big deal. And I can see the sides getting scratched up where the bin goes in and out. I would of given it a 5 if it weren't for some of the negative things mentioned above. Overall, I think it's perfect and am very pleased. Lastly, I purchased this through Baby Age and shipping was very fast (3 days from day ordered to day received with standard shipping)."
5,Even though nobody will see this. . .,"This is one of the most innovative, whacked-out god sends of an album I've ever heard. Alice Donut...gone but impossible to forget, not to mention one of the greatest credits to dementia the world had never seen."
4,Alice Donut - 'Donut Comes Alive' (Howler),"Originally released in 1988, as this was the New York alternative punk band's first effort. Believe I saw them open for Nirvana many moons ago. During their time together, Alice Donut put out seven CD's and many EP's from 1986-96. Tracks here I got the most out of were the awesome ""Green Pea Soup"", ""New Jersey Exit"", the unexpected Donovan cover ""Sunshine Superman"", the snippet ""Love is A Thickle Thing"" and semi-humorous ""Tipper Gore"". Might possibly appeal to fans of the Butthole Surfers, Jesus Lizard, Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth."
4,The recipes I've tried have been worth the price.,"I recommend this book to anyone interested in cooking vegetarian. The tofu basil lasagna alone is worth the price of the book, and I've even pulled off making it for a Christmas dinner (the die-hard meat eaters had no idea, and even had seconds!).The muesli recipe is excellent, and I've made the garlic green beans a staple in my house.The only drawback is that there is no nutritional information provided, which is a drag for label-readers like myself.It may be a silly point, but the book holds up pretty well in the kitchen, what with sauce and splotches mucking it up, and if it ever gets REALLY messed up, I would pay the money to replace it.Hope this helps anyone with a decision."
3,Wait for the next one,This book is wonderful if you like 70's type vegetarian food. I worked in the kitchen at Kripalu for a fair few years recently and we never used this book.The menus and complexity of the food has improved and matured over the years. So I would wait until the new book comes out in the next few years.
3,Too many obscure ingredients,"Unless you have a health food store around the corner, you may want to pass on this one. I don't have barley malt or rice syrup in my pantry and those are the main sweeteners used. Along with a long list of ingredients I'd have to drive a long way to a large health food store to buy (agar-agar, wakame, mirin, kuzu, umeboshi vinegar, etc.). I've found the Moosewood cookbooks much more pantry friendly. I love Kripalu's food when we visit, but can't really see myself using this cookbook often because so many recipes require a special trip."
3,"It's far better than ""Europa""","Just got my copy...was disappointed . Granted, it was interesting to see the Spanish videos that I hadn't seen before ( the videos released prior to ""Vuelve"" ) but the rest of it, major Ricky fans probably have already seen . I was hoping for some concert footage . Our boy really has to release some new material ."
1,Horrible,"the quality of this music is just pathetic. You can tell it's an indie release... the singer can't even sing, the guitars twang out of tune, the drums go off beat more than once... typical record from a talentless indie band who think they're all that. This review has nothing to do with their stopnapster.com site, any sane person who listens to this will agree that this is garbage. Who would even want their music for free, let alone to pay for it??? Let's just hope this pathetic band gets no further."
2,CAREFUL,FIRST HIS BOOK HAS A LOT OF ITEMS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ALSO NO ONE SHOULD SELF INITIATE THEMSELVES IN PALO IT IS DANGEROUS IF EVERYONE DID THAT SOON EVERYONE WOULD BE INITIATING THEMSELVES IN ORISHA SAINT I HAVE USED ONE OF THE SPELLS IN HIS BOOKS THE ONE FOR EL NEGRO JOSE IT WORKED.AS FOR THE PALO STUFF GET SOMEONE TO INITIATE YOU FOR HEAVEN SAKE.HIS BOOKS HAVE IN TO MUCH IMFORMATION THAT IS NOT CORRECT.ALSO SOME OF HIS SPELLS ARE NOT COMPLETED WHICH EITHER MEAND HE DOES NOT KNOW OR LEAVE IT UP TO YOU. I THINK HIS BOOKS SHOULD BE BANNED FROM AMAZON WEB SITE .THEY MISINFORM YOU.AND THIS IS THE GENERAL VIEW OF LOTS OF PEOPLE..
1,one good point in book,"the definitions of the palos are accurate to a point. the rest is horror fiction. this man is a con and is ripping off gringos that can't read spanish and/or are afraid to ask those in the religion. this book would turn off any one that took him seriously, this book is bad press and i am sure his others are also."
1,Right on the nose,"I agree with the other two reviews. Basically the book has no historical or background info, just recipies for spells. The type of Palo presented in this book is from Brazil, so I have no idea how much it has in common with Palo as practiced in Cuba or the U.S."
1,Waste of money,"He is so wrong, that is not worth the paper is written in. If you own a copy write the author for your money back, I did."
1,"BAD PRODUCT ~~~DON""T BUY~~~~","Bought this unit from Wal&art. Worked great for two weeks then, no longer worked. I left it outside for two weeks. Exchanged for another. Also worked great for another two weeks then nothing. Took that one back also. Durability of this product is ZERO. Buy a Flowtron and save yourself the hassel. This company can't make a good product."
1,Did not kill a single mosquitto in more than 2 weeks,"We tried this for more than two weeks and did not kill a single mosquitto, though there are plentifull around the house. Only killed one bee. Waste of money. The lower-end product with the clear bulb worked better - killed some mosquittoes."
1,only works one month,"stinger ultra bug zapper, the only bug zapper readily purchased at Lowes and Home Depot. I purchased three of these last spring. replaced bulbs about every month. By the end of Summer only one still worked. I took it out of storage and plugged it in this spring and it didn't work even after bulb changes. Stinger makes a Piece of Junk!!!My first Flowtron lasted 6 years and never needed a bulb change. I threw it out because I couldn't figure out how to change the bulb and purchased a new one when my stingers quit working last summer. It worked when I plugged it in this spring but the bulbs burned out. After replacing both bulbs, only one bulb worked. { NOT MADE LIKE THEY USED TO BE!}"
3,Bug Magnet,"I put one up of these bug zappers last summer. The next morning when I went out to check on it, the wire screens were COMPLETELY CLOGGED with bugs. I got a can of compressed air and blew the thing clean. The next morning, it was completely clogged again. I had to go out every morning and clean the thing out. If I forgot to clean it out, the bugs would build up so thick it would lose its effectiveness (not to mention that it would become extremely difficult to clean).Now it's spring time. The unit had been hanging outside all winter (unplugged). I plugged it in today and nothing happened. The power LED is on, but the bulb doesn't light. I hope it's just the bulb."
2,zapped out,"Purchased the zapper last year. worked well for awhile got wet and crapped out. Dried it out and it restarted. This year it worked for the spring, and died in a rain storm. I know the directions say to turn it off during heavy rain, but who's up a 3am to do this. Poor design! BottomStinger UVB45 40 Watt 1-Acre Ultra Bug Zapperof grid is solid plastic which collects dead bugs and also collects moisture and rain which intern causes a short in the grid and it zaps itself out of existance."
3,Low Watts,This item only carries a bulb of about 45 watts. My old unit used a 75 watt bulb. There is a big difference in the effectiveness from the lower watt bulb.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!,"I bought one of these, 10 days later it was a light with no zap! Took it back got another, less than 2 weeks same deal! They are JUNK!!! And I see that many people have had problems with them!"
1,3 out of 3 -JUNK,"Last spring I purchased 3 of these. One year later I can now report all 3 dead, all with different problems too! Total junk, avoid this brand."
1,Stinger zapper,"I have gone through 4 Stinger 1-acre zappers in 2-1/2 years. I have found that the bulbs have to be replaced about every three months and that the units burn out in less than a year--even though I keep them cleaned out.While the company offered to replace one of the units, I determined that the time to package it up carefully and pay a substantial shipping fee makes it not worthwhile. I suspect that this, like so much schlock coming in from China, is very cheaply made. I've gotten better longevity with their smaller, 1/2-acre units--but those aren't so effective. When the big units work, they're great. It's just that they die early. I will try another brand. I have a large place with some turtle ponds, so mosquitos are a problem. I use dunks, monquito fish and zappers to keep the situation manageable. I live in California, where mosquito-borne West Nile Virus is a problem; hence I need good protection."
1,Simply does not work,"It appears the weak link in these units is the flourescent starter. Works well when it is working, but that is not very often."
1,Stung by the Stinger,"Bought 2 of these POS from Lowes, and gave one as a wedding gift. The one I kept lasted about 2 months before the bulb wouldn't light. Did an exchange at Lowes with no problems. The replacement unit lasted about 3 months. Unfortunately I misplaced my receipt and tossed the box. Worst part is when we asked about the one we'd given as a wedding gift, it had only lasted about a 4 months. So I've been stung for about $50 X 2."
2,Works Pretty Well But...,"So I bought this bug zapper at Lowe's and hung it up on a large tree. I set the zapper to to come on during the night-time hours, which is a nice feature. It took me a few days to figure out it didn't even come on! I played around with it for awhile and determined it did not work at all. I took it back and got another one. The 2nd one turned on but would not stop sparking. According to the directions, the metal cage was too close to each other. I messed around with it for awhile and then took it back because it would not stop sparking. The 3rd one seems to work fine!Bottom line, if you find one that works, it seems to work very well! Keep your receipt though."
4,This seems to be a great product,We bought this to put in our attic to kill stink bugs. It seems that they are coming a lot more these days.It seems to work so far. we are happy with this product.I had read a lot of mixed review so we were not too sure of what to expect but so far we really killed a lot of them. Let's hope it continues!If it does not I will update this review. But at this time I am recommending this product.The package arrived damaged so this is why it did not get 5 stars.thanks
1,Quality? I think not!,"I purchased two of these from Home Depot. They both worked flawlessly for ONE night. The next night, the bulb wouldn't light up on one and on the other, the zapping grid was dead. Took them back to HD and got replacements. One lasted two nights then the zapping grid went dead and on the other, the bulb would not come on. (Yes, I did swap the bulbs around. The units were dead) These are excellent zappers if you only need them for one night."
1,Died in less than a week,"mine didn't make it past it's first week. also I'm not sure it worked any better than candles and/or bug spray. I plug it in and it won't start. home depot wouldn't take it back(with out receipt, i probably tossed into there trash can) even for an exchange. I'm guessing they break alot and often. if you really like and want to fix you can buy a kit to fix them.I'm just going to use that yard bug spray"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I bought one of these at Home Depot 2 days ago and will return it. The light comes on, but t doesn't zap bugs. The first time I plugged it in, in my kitchen, it zapped, and that was it."
3,Worked well at first but doesn't last !,"I bought this product after a friend's recommendation last spring. I placed it on a far corner of our deck and it did work well at killing insects. However, the grid quickly becomes clogged with dead insects and killing power is reduced drastically until you clean it with compressed air. Then, this spring I went to put it out again and the unit won't operate. I bought a new UV bulb thinking that was the issue, but it still doesn't work. Called customer support and they tell me it's likely a bad starter. Now I have to deal with returning and waiting weeks for my unit back. Get a Flowtron instead - my neighbor has had one for years!!"
1,Wished I'd have read the reviews!,"Apparently I'm not the only one having this problem which is a big disappointment to the manufacture of these bug lights. I bought this one in March, plugged it in and chose the ""sundown"" option where the light would turn on at dusk. I noticed it working fine ... for about two weeks. I was assuming the bulb had burned out since the power light to the unit was functioning. I bought a replacement bulb for another 20 bucks or so, replaced the bulb tonight and had no luck. I've been a fan of the Stinger for quite a few years but this ULTRA model is apparently nothing but garbage. Yeah, it's going to work great for a while but don't expect it to last. Definitely NOT worth the price tag ... in this case, pricier does NOT mean ""better."""
1,Bad Product Only lasted 2 weeks!,"I purchased this item from home depot 2 weeks ago, it worked great for 2 weeks then 1 day just no zapping anymore, I am in luck it is under 30 days for a full refund at home depot, do not buy this product at all, read more posts there is no reason for any well made product to be this much of a piece of junk."
1,"Had two, both died.","This is a very bad bug zapper. Although it worked fine for a week, it the proceded to die. This happened with TWO new units. No rain, no bad weather, just a piece of junk."
1,Defective Product,"I purchased two of these units last season and low and behold, this season as of two days ago, one of the units stopped working. Like everyone else in these reviews, I tried to replace the bulb but to my surprise that didn't work. The reviews are right these units are junk and don't hold up. I'm waiting for the second unit to stop working. I guess its simply a matter of time. I was tempted to go buy / exchange this unit for another Stinger but after all these reviews not a snowball chance in hell. I'm looking for another brand perhaps a Flowtron."
5,Stinger bug killer,Bought one of these from Walmart when I worked there 3 years ago. Went back a month or so ago and couldn't find another one like it. Ordered one thru Amazon. I have never had any problem with the first one. Once a month I take it to my shop and blow it out and clean the bulb. Both of them do exactly what they are designed to do . I always keep a spare bulb on hand in case one burns out. Not a big deal.
2,Works great for about a month,"I purchased one of these last spring and it worked great for about a month, then the daylight sensor failed. I returned the unit for replacment under warranty (shipping, $35.00, at my expense). some time late in the fall a replacment unit arived.This spring I put the replacement unit out in the garden, and it worked for about two weeks. Now the power light is on, but the UV bulb is not lighting and there is no power on the grid.I called KAZ Canada and all they can offer is another exchange under warranty with the shipping at my expense again. it seems to me that the problem is with their product, therefore they should cover the cost of shipping the defective product back.I am disappointed with the quality of the product and the poor service from KAZ.I wish I had read on-line reviews before purchasing this lamp."
1,JimBob,"Bought one of these, and it worked great for a month or less. Bulb went out, so I ordered a few replacement lamps to get a quantity discount. The unit stopped working a week or two after the new lamp was installed. I called, and they had me return the unit to them for repair or replacement. The new one arrived after a long wait, and also failed within weeks. Now, I'm stuck with the replacement lamps and a non-functioning unit. I'll use the lamps in a modified unit from a different manufacturer. Frankly, I don't understand why the make these lousy units year after year, and never bother to make them worth buying?"
1,waste of money,"have had three of these things, not one has made it an entire year. if its not electrical its cheap plastic. whish i could post video on here, i have cameras on my house and caught video of this thing falling apart with no wind and exposing live electrical wires. do not buy!"
1,Stopped working 12 hrs after purchase,"Purchased from walmart. Hung that night. Worked great for a few hours. By morning, would not come on...even with so,ar sensor fixed to on at all times. Called company. They said it was a dud and to return it. Purchased a flowtron and can honestly say I have noticed a rapid decline in mosquito bites! Probably a 90% reduction. Please, buy a flowtron!!! I wasn't expecting much of an improvement since these are not really geared to kill mosquitoes despite the advertising, but flowtron is great! And, they sell factory refurbs on the website!"
1,Horrible,I will start off by stating I purchased this bug zapper through my local home improvement store just because I wanted to pick it up same day. This Stinger bug zapper worked well for about 3 nights then it failed. The unit lit up UV to attract bugs but the zapper portion of the unit did not work anymore. I returned it to the store and immediately ordered the Flowtron BK-80D which is SUPURB (first time I can turn on my porch light and there are no bugs or moths flying towards my porch light (after 30 mins still no bugs near porch). Do not buy any Stinger bug zappers unless you plan on returning it as quick as you bought it. Flowtron has been making bug zappers since the 80's I would trust them more than any other bug zapper manufacturer.
1,Don't get BITTEN by Stinger!,"I have owned two of these units, both of which quit working in less than a year. While it works, it does a fine job of killing bugs, but it must be cleaned very frequently or the grids will short circuit with dead bugs. Not to worry though, you won't have to deal with cleaning it after it stops working! It's a shame that KAZ (Stinger brand) makes and markets such a piece of crap. I will do MY part to help put them out of business. The name KAZ and STINGER are burned into my brain and I'll be sure to never purchase any of their products again. Please, do the same and use your money more wisely than I did."
3,IPAQ 4in1 stylus.,"The stylus is nice, works fine. I do not feel that it was worth what I paid for it."
3,Super Reader,"Hands in the Dark is a tale of two Bobs and one Betty. There is a complex convocation of gangsters throughout, including a Tong leader. A significant sum of money obtained through swindling, is involved. The Shadow does a lot of the work to crack the case early, and in the second half of the book, starts using his agents. Harry Vincent manages to avoid capture.There is a new police character, Action Detective Herbert Zull, who may be a bit dodgy.It all ends with a chase involving a plane and a train, and a shootout, but no automobiles."
3,electro fading out...........................,"When I listened to this CD last night, my worst fears were almost confirmed. I thought that Arpanet may have taken the Dopplereffekt route by supplying us with experimental industrial sounding ambient material. Track #6 brings us back to familiar territory. This is where things pick up. Track 11 starts to recall the Wireless Internet album. Not much progress from this point on, but nevertheless a must have for collector's of Detroit electro. If you miss Drexciya (rip James Stinton) then pick this up as reminder of what once was.....and what can still be! 313 electro techno on mind."
4,The former bass player of Dead Kennedys still shows talent,"Klaus used to play bass for the punk band Dead Kennedys, but through listening to this album, it is apparent that he has changed quite a bit. Most of the songs are soft and melodic, but either way they sound great. I prefer ""Opaque"" and ""My Town."" Most of the songs were performed completely by Klaus, and some of them are outright wierd while the others portray good views."
3,"Moments of Brilliance, Moments of Tedium","This album holds a very special place in my personal history. The fifth track, ""Uncle Bill,"" was instrumental in pushing me towards more diverse music than what i had grown up with, i.e. The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, etc.It was only many years after hearing this song that I found out who was responsible for making it (the esteemed bassist of the Dead Kennedys, Klaus Flouride), and what album it was on. I had read Mark Prindle's Rock'n'Roll Review of the album, and had a goo idea of what I would be getting.Essentially, I bought this album on the strength of one song, ""Uncle Bill."" None of the other songs are remotely like it; some are catchy but forgettable pop, others are experimental and crude electronica, which i can't imagine anyone finds pleasing to the ear. But alas, I had no other way of attaining that singular opus, ""Uncle Bill""In short, this album is for fanatics only; the average Dead Kennedys or casual listener need not apply."
5,Very Interesting and organized,"I am taking this class at FDU (where Professor Triebel is teaching this class) and I find that its a very organized text.there may be a few errors here and there, but it also helps to simply ask the Author for help regarding any possible errors.Professor Triebel retired from Intel and has intimate knowledge of the 8088/8086 core (as well as the new Itanium) so he's more than qualified in this field.We are also taking the lab to accompany this class (there's a separate lab manual) and that pretty much bridges the gap between theory and practical applications. The reason being that you can learn the theory behind the instructions in the lecture, but the lab allows you to see the instructions in action."
4,Flavacol Popcorn Salt,The Flavacol has a good flavor! It was very easy to use. We also bought the caramel flavoring - which we also like. Shipped on time.
2,EXPENSIVE shipping,"I am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping. The product costs $29.95, and shipping is $22.49 ... Doubling the cost!This is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater I worked in during high school. I adore it."
1,Way over priced!!,"This is only salt and flavoring folks, it is not worth $40! I just went and looked at a carton I bought, ok quite a few years ago, BUT the price on that carton is $1.95!!! And it is the exact same size and same carton. Do you really think salt went up that much!"
3,what the ????,"what the hell is this? i have an 06' aerio sx and was wandering past this, what is it supposed to do? it looks like some octane booster and an electrical meter."
3,Routine....,"....Sums up this book pretty nicely. Neither its Star Wars setting, or its military leanings are anything except average. Despite Karen Traviss' credentials I found the military aspect quite questionable. No real rationale is given for the way the operation is played out, and it comes off as rather contrived. The Star Wars influence is hardly felt here. With a few references thrown around and a useless(?) Jedi tossed in to meet the quota. I purchased this book based off the rave reviews written here, and against my better judgment. I should have stuck with my gut feeling on this one. The most telling thing, for me, is that after reading a book featuring hi-tech commandos and Jedi I remember Nothing that excited me. Nothing."
3,Second to Shatterpoint,"While the book really highlights the life of a clonetrooper, it wasn't as exciting of a novel I hoped it to be. The game is an action-packed shooter but there is barely any of that in the novel. Too much covert-ops for my taste.Shatterpoint is by-far my favorite Clone Wars novel so far. I suggest reading that. Hard Contact is second because many of the Clone Wars novels have been very bad."
5,Karen Traviss Has got it when it comes to clones!,"This book above all else is an extension of knowledge and adventure for those fans who for them - Clones Or Mandalorians, (very nearly the same thing)are there main interest. As not much information on Mandalorians is out there, these books will provide if not little but important pieces of info that will be of interest! Traviss has perfected within the Clones very realistic and admirable characters! although all the same seed (of Jango) they are all independant personalities bred for war and nothing else! Their interactions with other characters throughout the novel are captured brilliantly and for me, exactly how they should be portrayed. A very fluent and exiting read that is full of Traviss' brilliance! Like I said before, if you like Star Wars or anything to do with Mandalorians READ THE BOOK - and the follow ups! Jack Hammond"
5,A mother's dream come true,"I could not get my Star Wars loving middle school child to pick up a book. He has always been an avid reader but I just could not find any books other than Star Wars themed books to interest him and they were all too short for my advanced reader. I then hear about Karen Traviss. I am thrilled to have found her because my child has not put down this book - reads for hours at a time and I do mean ""four"" hours at a time! Child thinks they are awesome!!! Thank you Ms. Traviss for your wonderful writing ability - please continue. Purchased three others in addition to this one and he is equally exicted to read those as well."
4,"Why it's called the ""CLONE Wars""","Four clone commandos (a notch above clone troopers, but a notch below ARCs) team up with an insecure Jedi Padawan on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines. Although it gets quite philosophical about breeding men to fight and die, it's still a kick-butt action story that features some clever characterization and ""Star Wars""-style banter. It fits in perfectly with the tone of the last two prequel films (good thing as it's set between them) - as the Jedi search their souls while continuing to fight ruthless villains on alien worlds. You'll get to know (and love) clones in this one.I guess I only have two minor knocks against the story - one was that other than the poisonous rat-like gdans, the setting was fairly mundane (actually seemed a lot like Indiana). Another was that the fight at the end, the climax, seemed a little too straightforward. These are minor quibbles, though.The other reviewers are right: this is a good ""Star Wars"" story."
4,Great Book - awsome development of characters,"What a awsome book. I was surprised by the depth of character development by the author and how the story progressed to a great conclusion. I hope that the Omega Squad will come back again for another book under such as good author as this. I recommend this book not only to SW fans, but to fans of military fiction as well. The author has a good grip on military action and jargon. Fans of the Black Library will also enjoy this book."
5,Great Book....Can't wait for the Video Game,"Unlike others I read this as a preview of the video game. So I was excited about it for different reasons when I picked it up. In the end the book gave more than I would have ever expected...lately Star Wars books have been seeming dull and even mundane to me. This book renewed my waning interest in actually reading the books. (I own all the adult novels, I cant stop now so I just keep buying) Now I have quite the pile to slog through in hopes of a gem like Hard Contact.I highly recommend this book, it is fast paced, exciting, humorous without overdoing it...definitely worth the read. And if the game is anything like what is described in the book the future of star wars is looking fantastic. Especially with E3 on the horizon. Cant wait to see what else is in store for my favorite place far far away....."
3,NICE! 1,THE ARE DA BOMB! Caught their show in the Wetlands and lost my mind. Get the CD but go see them live. Trust me.
4,Good all around album,"If I could I would give 4 and a half stars. This album is really near perfect and has very clean jams different from those of medeski, martin and wood. There is a taste of hip hop beats but this leans more towards the sound of a classic jazz jam band. The 2 tracks that feature John Scofield flow very nicely. The only flaw I found was that the one track titled azucar is rather boring and sounds like something you here while your on hold on the telephone. all in all it is a very good album and i would recomend it to anyone that likes jam bands or jazz alone."
3,The Secret River,"This edition of ""The Secret River is beautiful. However, I expected the original version first published after the author's death and prefer it for its simplicity and believe the illustrations, while less ornate, go better with the story. So I was disappointed."
4,"Good voice, mixed songs.","The first song rainbow is absolutely beautiful. Her voice carries a lot of emotions. The rest of the albums are generally good with exception of a few songs. If you like Dido, Sarah McLachlan, you'll enjoy this album."
3,"Great songs. So, so sound quality","Saw here in one of Andrea Bocelli concert and out of curiosity, bought her album"
5,Rocked My Soul,"this cd blew me away.. i am completely in love with it, especially rock your soul!!! i suggest everyone go out and buy this cd cause it is amazing. Elisa has an incredible voice and an incredible style. my grandmother passed away recently and i went to dance the night after her funeral and we did a lyrical combination to rock your soul and it moved me and i fell in love. This cd has helped me get through a lot, it brings out every emotion. ELISA YOU'RE AWESOME!!!!"
1,I feel a little ripped off..,"I have to admit the title clearly states that this is part 1, But the story doesn't finish or show you the murder theory they have been building up to for 118 mins. How many incomplete/to be continued documentaries have you purchased,or watched that the next part isn't already available? This is a first for me.."
2,Blend of Truth and Fiction,"This documentary is blend of truth and fiction. To the makers credit they scored personal interviews with Defeo family neighbors and close friends who give insight into the family and the events leading up to the murders along with rare family photographs not seen in almost 40 years.The Defeo murders were best summed up by attorney William Weber. "" This was the murder of a family, that could have been your neighbor or mine "" Granted there were problems in it but all families do. The best book written on the Defeo Murders was done in 1981 called "" High Hopes The Amityville Murders "". I cannot give this documentary more than 2 stars despite it's qualities because too much of the so called facts in it have been debunked by reliable sources and the Brigante and Defeo families long ago."
2,My review,This story as told is hard to believe. There is no documented proof to back up the claims of a woman with a not so great history herself.If you have read the book The Night the DeFeos Died then you will already have all the information as this documentary follows the book.
5,Just Amazing!,"Like others, I too would be hesitant about reaching for my jig saw for its lack of ability (Craftsman). On the job, my craftsman broke trying to cut a hole through 1 1/4"" subfloor. Before it broke it took forever to make an 8"" cut. I ran to the store to buy a new jig saw and came across the Bosch. Usually I research a tool extensively before purchase, but I had no time. I like the beefy look of the Bosch and it's other features. I bought it and went back my 1 1/4"" subfloor. At first I thought something was wrong. It went through the floor like butter. I was stunned at the power and precision of the cut. The shoe adjustments and speed dials are easy to use and great features. I will now reach for this jig saw more often."
5,Excellent Jigsaw,"I purchased this jigsaw a few months ago. A friend of mine had the previous model without the quick blade change and was very happy with it. In fact, he said that he would use it for many things that I typically pick up a circular saw for. Having heard that he preferred to rip lumber with his jigsaw, I had to give this a try.As for the credibility of my statements, I have only owned a cheap, $80 Ryobi jigsaw, so I was transitioning from a worthless saw, but WOW! I now find myself being less reluctant to pick up the jigsaw when needed. The quick change feature is amazing. as easy as the description says. The variable forward oscillation is a time saver and the speed stability of the saw is incredible. If you are in a hurry, you can push right through without bogging down the motor. Another great Bosch product added to my collection!I have nothing negative to say about."
5,Top of the line just got better!!,"I have had a model 1587 and decided to try a new 1590, both do a better job than most jig saws. I went for the new 1590 because of the ease of blade changes and extra blade support. My 1587 cuts and works fine, but the 1590 has just improved blade changes,power and more stable cutting. I would recommend either one,but I would prefer the 1590 over the 1587.As for the heating up mention by another review,I have had no such problem."
5,Amazing saw! No regrets,"This is the best jigsaw out there. No question in my mind! Absolutely smooth cuts, in birch plywood, white oak, or anything else. No vibration. Easy blade changes and foot angle/bevel changes. Nice, long, soft cord, that doesn't twist your tool around. Be sure to get some Progressor Wood blades from Bosch too - they're amazing, especially when paired with this saw.Shop around, though, if you want to save some bucks and get this shipped quicker - Coastaltool dot com, for instance..."
5,Great Saw,"This is my first jig saw so I have nothing to compare it to, but it cuts perfect, feels extrimelly well made and has nice features like precision control and t shank blades. The dust blower doesn't do a good job though at lower speeds. Not much of a problem though."
2,crooked deal,The saw can not maintain an angle - even 90 deg. Every cut angles off. The company did respond to my call but the tool remains unreliable for my use.
4,Watch your fingers,"This is hands down the best Jigsaw I have ever used. Talk about power, this will talk a finger in a sec. It is smooth and powerful.I've had this for 3 years. The quick blade release and catch is great. No cons with this, great buy, I'm a home repair guy, it gets used and just works great. Watch your fingers, the blades they have are like razors."
4,multi-purpose tool for DIYers,"This was the first time I had used a jig saw. And it was for purposes of nailing down solid hardwood flooring at home. The 3 blades that accompany the jigsaw are also good. Cutting angles was not as clean as say a miter saw. But all in all, its a great multi-purpose tool."
3,Over Rated,"This has to be on of the most over rated tools that I have seen and used. Some things on the saw are really nice like the blade ejection, very simple and works great. The two big faults I have with it is how hot the thing gets and the variable speed trigger. You use it for any length of time and it gets almost too hot to hold. As for the variable speed trigger, I don't know why they find it necessary to put electronics on everything they make especially when they can't ever get it right. Any other variable speed jig saw I've ever used has been nice and smooth in the variable speed range. This thing is just all over the place. I tried a new switch and it works the same way. I'd recommend the 1587 over this one but they make those in China now so, I don't thing there is such a thing as a good jig saw anymore."
5,5 Star Review #146.,"After 145, 5 star reviews there is not much I can say that hasnt been said all ready.This tool has never let me down, and I look forward to opportunity to grab it out of the trailer.You will not be dissapointed in this tool, and you will be hard pressed to find a better jigsaw at any price."
3,Variable speed ?????,"I bought this saw to replace/upgrade my 1587 and although the saw cuts straight and true, the variable speed trigger is JUNK. It jumps from 0 to higher speed and there is no blade control in the low RPM range. I talked to Bosch about it and they said that is the way it IS. They even pulled one out and tested it for me. My old 1587 has a great variable speed trigger that allows you to enter the work at near zero speed.I would note that using the dial speed control has little if any effect on the problem.I will get along with it this way but would NOT repeat my purchase or recommend the saw to another buyer until Bosch re-designs the variable speed switch/ trigger.Has anyone else that bought this unit noticed this problem????"
5,Awesome saw........Cuts straight..........,This saw was worth every penny paid. It cuts straight because of the blade holding mechanisim. My old saw would let the blade bend slightly and therefore cut unsquare. It is a very powerful saw and has no trouble with any wood type. This is a dream come true.
5,"Clean Cut from a ""Slick"" Jigsaw","I've been used to enduring the HD special cheepo Jigsaws all my life. These things twist and warp during a cut until they finaly break. The Bosch is the first high end jigsaw I've worked with. It's most impressive feature, other than perfect cutting performance, is the effortless blade change feature. To remove a blade, all you have to do is push a button and ""PoP"" out comes the blade. Checked the sole plate alignment with a square and it's dead nuts on. The orbital motion really works- makes it cut like a hot knife through butter. I feel good about my purchase."
5,Performs as advertised,I had a Milwaukee jig saw for years. When it finally died I read the reviews of various other brands to get the best. The Bosch 1590EVSK has proven to live up to the positive reviews I read. The blades are quick and easy to change and the saw is easy to use. It cuts easily with very little vibration.
5,A real Ferarri,"I'd never owned a jigsaw that didn't end up in the garbage bin ... until this one!My Bosch 1590 jigsaw offers all the precision and feel I expect from quality machinery. In addition to using it as a crude little reciprocating saw (the most one can expect from many jigsaws on the market), I'm able to carve and sculpt with this one!Occasionally I've wondered why they didn't include an adjustment for something-or-other ... and then, on investigating, found they had. Well done.Bosch's easy-to-install blades are excellent, too."
5,awesome awesome tool,"Saw came and i put it right to work. i was cutting bamboo flooring to fit around vents and what not. Nice, clean cuts with not problems at all. Everything worked perfectly. Such a solid saw. HIGHLY recommend."
3,Good but not that good,"When I say ""it's not that good"", of course I mean its good, it's Swiss after all. But for $157.00 I could buy two Ryobis. Sure, the Ryobi tool is lighter, a little rougher running, but the base plate is very similar and smooth/non-maring, it comes with the little dust collection do-dad (extra accessory for the Bosch) it comes with a stout edge guide (extra accessory for the Bosch) and the case is solid, if a bit bigger. The Ryobi only comes with one general purpose blade, but it does a passable job and let's face it, you're not likely to be doing any fine wood working with a jig saw. You're going to cut some curves in a sheet of plywood or round the corners off some shelving or something, not build fabulous fine furniture. Oh, and did I mention the Ryobi has a scrolling knob and is about $67.00? Sheesh, I just think a Cadillac jig saw should at least come with an edge guide. I'm underwhelmed."
2,dele menos,"vaya, raza fo christ! ud. no tienen variedad en tu music. el unico canto bueno es ""verdades descubiertas"", los demas son algo aburridos, aunque la letra es chilero. pero da dolor de cabeza escucharlo por mucho tiempo.ud. traten demaciado duro ser como los demas, y la sena q aquel hace con su mano en the cover no tiene nada de bueno"
1,My Lost Innocence,"Others can provide spoilers for this story. I'll just disabuse the reader.You think you learned some tidbits of history, culture and geography from Dirk Pitt, don't you? This book makes anything you think you learned questionable, at best. The authors have ignored simple geography, played havoc with population distributions, and butchered cultures and their inter-relationships. Don't bet anything on accuracy...especially don't try taking a firearm of any type through Canadian customs thinking it will be easy and/or smooth. It WAS fun to read but the agony of error made me cringe at every turn of the page. The only thing truly needed to make this a decent book was an editor with a large blue pencil and a sense of humor."
1,Horible,"for clive cussler, i expect much more than this. i must admitt, though, that i am a fan of Dirk Pitt and dislike this Cussler character, Kurt Austin"
1,Second author,I have a basic distrust of a writer using hsi/her name to seel a book I think was written primarily by someone else.
4,White Death,"I like the character and plot development. Good reading. ""White Death"" captivates the reader right from the beginning until the end."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.A fast-paced, no nonsense delivery is what you expect from Cussler. That's what you get. I too was surprised when I received this in a hardback instead of the paper. What I thought (since it was a hardback) was that Kurt Austin was going to replace Dirk Pitt as Cusslers main protagonist. I also got the impression that I would be reading a better novel (such as the Dirk Pitt hardbacks). Well it is good entertainment, and without a doubt, action packed, but its become a bit formulaic.I will still always jump on the newest Cussler novel and certainly look forward to the newest Dirk Pitt.Highly recommended."
3,Better than the last Pitt novels,"Having read all of the Pitt and Austin novels, I would put this in the middle of the road, not as good as the early Cussler adventures, but not nearly as flat as the last couple of Pitt stories. Fortunately, Kemprecos spares the readers of Cussler's annoying cameos and doesn't spend too much time describing the outfits of the characters. Otherwise, its your basic Pitt novel with some some superficial changes to the lead characters.I have to give the author(s) credit for turning Eskimos into an army of murderous thugs, just when I thought they were running out of ethnic groups to slander. I'll never look at another igloo without wondering if there's a 1930s airship loaded with mutated fish inside. And speaking of mutated fish, wasn't this a scene from Austin Powers?All kidding aside, its not a bad diversion, though it is a predictable one."
1,Laughable at Best,"It's easy for the reader to enjoy a Clive Cussler novel, as long as one takes it for what it really is: a comic farce of an adventure story. I never grow weary of the heroic adventures of DirKurt and AlJoe. From the neverending billion to one chances for survival which always pan out for the good guys, to the downright laughable cast of evil characters who never fail to perform the classic evildoer blunder of ""here's my plan, now ponder your fate while I leave you unattended"". Throw in the fact there isn't a single person on the planet who can out(fill in skill here) DirKurt and AlJoe, using their natural and honed talents, plus that heapin' helpin' of good ole American gumption, and you get a novel which produces rolling belly laughs from even the most hardened reader."
3,Could have been better,"As a Cussler fan, I was disappointed with his latest, ""White Death"". Yes, it has all the elements of a good Cussler novel: action, adventure, a bit of romance, some history tied in, travel... but the writing was terrible. The writing was stiff, stilted and at a 6th grade level. I expected better, and I think his fans deserver better."
3,"Good , but not one of the better ones","I have always enjoyed Clive Clussers books but this one let me down. I thought a lot of what went on in the book was predictable. I thought there seemed to be a lot of time gaps where the charactors in the book, based on the timeline, had enough time to carry out their task but seemed to wait for Austin to safe the day. To say that Austin was to replace a special forces unit was a long reach. The book did hold my interest but unlike the Dirk Pitt adventures I don't think I'll be reading this one more than once."
5,white death,"As usual, Clive Cussler has painted an exciting novel. I thought I knew what the book was about by the title but that's not so. Its well worth the read!"
2,Reads like Austin Powers trying to be serious,"When the Eskimo villain captured our hero, Kurt Austin (or is it Austin Powers?), I expected him to say, ""Welcome to my evil lair."" He even had his own form of ill tempered sea bass! I'm sorry, but this thing read like a farce. Dog sleds in downtown DC? Mutant fish that may take over the world? Give me a break. Furthermore, the book was just plain boring. The action was only compelling in a few sections (unlike most of Cussler's books)."
2,This story was too much...,Clive if you would have left out the Basques and the Germans then the balance of the story would have been enough. I would have loved to read about a huge corporation trying to corner the salmon market. You could have even fit in a murder or two and made it interesting. This fish story doesn't hold water with me...I gave it a two out of respect. This novel could have had the ridiculous title of James Bond and the Killer Salmon. It would have worked for the die hard James Bond fan. Not for me.
2,"If you've read others by Cussler, don't bother with this one","If you've ever read a Clive Cussler book, don't waste your money on this one, it is the same old story. In this book, an evil corporation is threatening to take over the seas and destroy the environment. Kurt Austin is called in to save the day -- are you asleep yet?I give this book two stars because it is ok if it is your first Cussler book. I've read several of his books however, and this one was a waste of time for me. The ending is pretty corny as well. I don't think I'll bother with any more Cussler books for awhile."
4,A little obvious,"You can see the ending coming from the first page. But, as always, Cussler is still a good read. A lot happens between the first and last pages."
3,White Death,"Love Clive Cussler and enjoyed this book, however, I thought the romance line was a bit distracting. Having read all the Dirk Pitt novels, and in looking for something of equal enjoyment, I've tried the first couple of Kurt Austin books. Uncertain if I will continue the series. I like the characters; however, there is a lot of extraneous information that just makes for a longer book, which is distracting and doesn't add to the excitment."
4,Clive's Best Books,"Like all of Clive Cussler's books, this one was just too good to put down. Hope he continues to produce these stories. I especially like the Oregon Files series."
4,White Death,"A fun read, kept my interest as I like the Kurt Austin/Joe Zavala/Numa Files adventure series. Long enough to last for a couple evenings, or a vacation day or so."
3,Weird even by Cussler's standards,"Clive Cussler has never been one to bow to plausibility in his novels. Filled with strange situations, bizarre plots, and even more bizarre characters, their fantastic situations are what makes them fun. This work goes beyond Cussler's usual strangeness-far beyond.The plot involves an evil tribe of Native Americans that run a fish company using a zeppelin lost over the Arctic in the 1930s and subsequently repaired to drop their mutant fish into the Atlantic, where they would eat the competition and give them full control over the world's fish. Several individual scenes match the main plot in ridiculousness, such as a dogsled chase through a large, snowless city.The prose isn't any better or worse than any other Cussler novel. If you love weirdness, get this. If you don't, leave it."
3,White Death,"Like most of Cussler's work, this is a great read, and even better listen. I've been known to sit in my car after traveling, just to hear the last of a chapter. This was one of those.My only gripe was the format of the C D, it only has one trak per disc. If you don't have a fast forward feature on your player, you have to listen over again to get to where you stopped. I've never run into this before."
4,Cliched and fun!,"Don't read Clive Cussler if you want fine literature.Read Cussler if you want a wild romp in a over-the-top fantasy world of likeable good guys and really really bad guys!Cussler may write cliched, far-fetched ""mind candy"" but he is VERY consistent... consistently getting a little better over the years. He has shown a noticeable improvement from his earliest books.So if you've enjoyed Cussler before it's a good bet that you'll like ""White Death."" If you're looking for something ""profound"" then you'll be disappointed."
1,Condition misrepresentation,Book was characterized as 'good' and arrived in pieces with the back broken and in three parts. Very heavily used.CCA
3,Look Carefully,"Although this may be a quality replacement battery, it is not made by APC--despite whatever photo is displayed with the description. Had to return a couple of these and Amazon CS may correct the image based on my feedback. Meanwhile, just make sure you're buying what you expect."
1,There are better/cheaper options,Get this model instead: Brand: TEMPEST Model: TR9-12More juice - 9Ah instead of 7AhCheaper: $18 instead of $39Long life: typical 6 years
4,Computer Backup battery,Seems to be working fine and I like having the 10 outlets even though I can't use all 10 because even the widely spaced ones aren't far enough apart for a couple of my adapters.
2,No longer contains free return of old battery,"The RBC2 listed here on longer contains a free return of the old battery, so add the shipping cost and headache of getting it shipped UPS. Some of the batteries listed still have free shipment; maybe they are old stock."
1,"Sub-standard, not fit form, functional replacement","The battery contacts do not mate with the original APC system, this is not a fit form replacement to the APC battery. If you bend the ABC contacts you can make the battery contact, but ultimately it would be unreliable.I think this is a case of ""you get what you pay for"", I was hoping for a fit, function, replacement but found that ABC missed the mark and has provided a sub-standard product which is of no use."
2,ABC RBC2 UPS Battery,"review unknown, ask me in two years !The battery purchased was a replacement for a battery in a APC back-up unit;it fit perfectly; why shouldn't it.The battery it replaced was an after market battery that had failed anddistorted so badly the entire back-up frame had to be disassembled to remove thebattery. ( 1.5 year life span, not acceptable ! )WE WILL SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES BEFORE THIS ONE FAILS.If this is coming from 'THAT COUNTRY', 'AMERICA, WAKE UP !!!!!! '"
1,Not what I wanted,I was thinking this was Sid Myers Gettysburg I was getting. Turns out I get a cheap ancient program way before Sid Myers time. Oh the program works but it wasn't what I ordered. It's a very cheap version of a game called gettysburg.Won't make that mistake again.
1,Vacuous Nonsense,"When I bought this video at auction, I thought that I was getting the original. I dont know where to begin in expressing how bad this film is."
1,Could have been better,"This movie had too many things in it that were not neccesary. For instance, when the sister dragged through that song at the bar. By this time I was fast forwarding. Repetitive as hell, especially on the creatures. A plodding pace, uneven story, it was a real disappointment and I can't believe that Wes let his name be put on it."
1,1 STAR???!?!?,"Just put it this way.. I gave it one star because Amazon.com doesn't give an option to rate it 0 star.... Please, please waste your money on anything but this video"
5,A Remarkable Work of Scholarly Synthesis,"Steven Wasserstrom's brilliant and fascinating book is a marvellous study of three of the most brilliant and fascinating twentieth-century scholars of religion. All too often, readers are unaware of the human, idiosyncratic elements that inevitably shape the perspective of writers in various fields of the humanities. Dr. Wasserstrom gives us an objective view of these elements, and brings a new sense of depth to the background that contributed to the interests and, ultimately, to the published work of Corbin, Eliade, and Scholem."
4,very comfy shoe,"After trying on several pairs of shoes (mostly adidas and new balance), I found this to be by far the most comfortable. It feels like the shoe is really encasing my foot but my toes still have plenty of wiggle room. I got the navy/silver/yellow ones from adidas.com which don't seem to be available any more but look really nice. This one seems to have a much better price though!"
5,Didn't get paid,"I have a friend who sold a video of this movie on Amazon.ca. The buyer received the video in good condition (and enjoyed the movie as well), but my friend never received his money from Amazon.ca. If you want this movie on DVD (and in English), email him at jaeho@treble.org."
5,Very Tasteful,"This CD is pretty minimal but always tasteful. A stately sounding CD, performed well.But listen to the tracks and decide for yourself."
1,Nothing new here.,There is nothing new in this disappointing book. If one had never read a book on New Age topics it is a good book but if you are looking for something new you won't find it here.
1,Same stuff different Author!,"I was disappointed in this audiobook. I was looking for something refreshing, new. It is the same old stuff packageddifferently.I found this audio book to be banal and I do wish the author had picked someone else to read this book as her voice does nothing to pull the listener in.For those who have not read this type of material by many other authors you may pick up some useful information."
4,great book,"Although I need vol I actually, but this book is also very good for me. Especially i need to work on S/C programming."
5,With teamwork compassion and friendship incredible things can be accomplished,"""I don't believe that I am here: what a present from God, to see all this,"" says one of the climbers.This beautifully shot, well-edited, well-narrated film with its intriguing music and underlying theme of teamwork is enjoyable to watch, moving to experience, encouraging in its message.Its message brings to mind Joanna Macy'sWorld as Lover, World as Self: A Guide to Living Fully in Turbulent times, Marshall Rosenberg'sNonviolent Communication: A Language of Life: Create Your Life, Your Relationships, and Your World in Harmony with Your Values (Nonviolent Communication Guides), and Robert Kegan'sIn Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life.For the climber, the traveler, the student of religion, politics, history, film or ecology on your list, this is a wonderful present, to be enjoyed many times."
3,Silvio wasn't meant for a band,"""Causas y Azares"" was ok, something different, a change. But this second album with Afrocuba was, in my opinion, a little bit too pretencious, starting with the cover of the record itself. (que no le pega a Silvio, vaya). The tittle song has a very nice melody but the words don't seem to come from Silvio: a long list of adjectives without much meaning. Can anybody tell me at the end whether ""la melancolia"" was a young girl or an old lady? However, most of the songs are great. He just should have recorded them only with his guitar. His voice and style just weren't meant for that kind of music and arrangements. I might have given the album 4 stars, but comming from Silvio, 3 is all it gets. My least favorite Silvio record until the sad appearance of ""Mariposas""."
5,This book is great to teach respect for animals,"This book is great to teach children respect for all life, including animals. It also well illustrates the destructive power that guns can have in the wrong hands. My kids were so much more concernced about animal welfare and the protection of endangered species after reading this book.It also reinforced their understanding of the evil nature of weapons in general. This book also helped them to understand the great wisdom the Buddha expressed so long ago that one should only kill animals when it is needed for one's own survival."
4,I would recomend,My son loves it and it is a durable pool.Has fun bright toys attached. I would reccomend this to you.
3,Good Fun,We bought this for our daughter. I would say that she likes the velcro balls and the rings the best. Good summer fun!!
3,Okay for price,"I bought this pool a year ago for my toddler. After only a few uses on grass we decided to put it on the deck - big mistake. It punctured immediately. However, because there are two layers of plastic, only the inner portion deflated so it still held water. I patched it and it seemed fine for a few more uses.I just brought it out again this year and blew it up yesterday. I had forgotten what a pain it was to blow up. (Pretty quick but it's a long time to a toddler.) The patch seemed to work but after a few hours sitting outside (on the grass) it deflated halfway. I've decided to try a solid plastic pool instead.For the price, this is a good first pool for a baby/toddler and it doesn't take too long to inflate. However, I wouldn't buy this product again due to it's lack of durability."
3,Decent Baby Pool,"My daughter put a hole in the bottom of this pool within minutes after inflating it. It still holds water and she enjoys playing with it, but mosting throwing stuff in the water, while she is out of the pool."
1,could not inflate it.....,"I was very excited about this pool, but am not able to inflate it... looks like there is no passage for air to go inside. dont know what to do. it had no instructions whatsoever with it. and neways how complicated cud it be.Did anybody experience the same prob???"
4,Fantastic for Toddlers,"My husband and I bought this pool for our daughter when she turned one. She has been using for the past year and loves it! It is small, probably not really big enough for more than one toddler. However, if you only have one child that is going to be using it, it's perfect. I would highly recommend."
2,No pictures,"Cheap, digital reprint with no pictures. You want me to say more, but this says it all. Buyer beware! I don't think I will bother writing a review again because you insist upon a set number of words."
3,Best as background music,No this isn't really Christmas music. Most of the pieces are antiphons which don't hold interest. And the melismas on track 19 (a motet) are warbly - on the edge of losing control. It does make nice background music because there is little to capture your attention.
4,"Fact, myth and error","Davenport gets the chronology of several non-musical events wrong--for example, the Mozarts' infant son died while his parents were visiting in Salzburg, not before they left. It's as if she wants to make them into the people she thinks they should be. The great thing is that this biography reads like a novel in many places, with inner monolog and dialog fleshing out many scenes. On the other hand, it reads like a novel, not a scholarly work. It's gotten a bit dated since 1932, but it's still a pretty fun read. She has a refreshingly positive view of Constanze and even Salieri."
1,This dvd has no redeeming value.,This dvd is the absolute worst. The singing is dubbed. The sets are ridiculous. The speech is at one volume and the singing is at a different volume. Avoid this dvd. I would give it minus 10 stars if I could. This is a movie from the 1970's that looks like it was designed in the 1960's.
5,Fun for All!,"This is a fun video for all ages but especially for children and teenagers. It is filled with jokes, laughter, and stunts to learn. I have had students who had very low self esteem academically but blossomed after learning to juggle with one of the Raspyni brothers. This video is perfect. Filled with fun and safe activities that will keep kids busy for hours, days, weeks, years! Thanks Raspynis!"
5,Fun for the whole family!,"This tape is an excellent way to learn things that you've always wanted to know how to do! It's fun for both children and adults, and is much cheaper than a babysitter! Our family watches it all the time."
1,Very disappointed...,"I was disappointed with this book. The title of it is very misleading. I was looking for a good collection of ghost stories, or at least something with a creepy tone. There are a few good stories, but none of them are ""campfire"" type stories at all. They are not remotely scary or fun to tell around the campfire! They are simply a collection of stories written about travelers in the outdoors and adventure stories. I will not be buying the other book in this collection."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G !,"As an avid outdoor person who frequently backpacks and car camps I was very eager to purchase this book from all the ""glowing"" reviews. I waited for the perfect outing (solo backpacking) and the right moment (dead of night) to read the first instalment. To make a long story short, I almost fell asleep! I totally agree with the reviewer who stated that these stories would be embarassing to tell in front of others, in fear that they also might fall asleep.Other than the well written article about a bear mauling, the other stories fall flat. Where is the famous ""Monkey's Paw""? The only people who would find these stories remotely scary are tea tottlers or the ocassional camper who gets scared watching an episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". If you really want to send chills down your spine bring a Stephen King novel or one of his novelette (Different Seasons) now that, would have you hearing bumps in the night!"
1,boring from front to end,This book was so droll. The adjectives describing this book were so off base. It was not spine-chilling.The only decent story in the book was about a bear attack. Why not just state that the book covers outings of misfortunes. What a waste of money and time. I was very disappointed.
3,Simplistic overview of the famous trial.,"The Nuremberg Trials are arguably the most famous trials of the 20th century; they were conducted to try, convict, and execute the surviving Nazis members of Hitler Germany for war crimes during World War II. This is a decent video for someone who does not know anything about the trials. It would be good for instructional purposes for high school students."
1,Cute but Incomplete and Often Wrong,"The storyline (a child going to the airport and taking a flight) and cute illustrations provide an engaging foundation to describe how airplanes and other aircraft fly. Unfortunately, the text is incomplete (it doesn't even attempt to explain how an airplane wing works) and, worse, frequently inaccurate. The author simply repeats many fundamental misconceptions (e.g., that jet engines work by because exhaust gases push on the outside air or that helicopters steer by tilting the rotor axis). This book not only fails to teach how airplanes fly, it explicitly teaches myths. Shame on the author for not doing the simple research it would have taken to get this right or for not having a competent person review his work."
5,Homeless In America CD Review,I have had the opportunity to listen to all Twenty One tracks on this CD. I was really touched by the music. The music was produced professionally and takes on a unique sound of it's own. The lyrics alone will help one identify with the social issues in America. I think this is an important CD as well as entertaning. This is a must hear CD for everyone.
3,A few billion dollar ideas... lots of junk.,"Cochrane fills this (very poorly edited) collection with mostly dull predictions. He does pose a few interesting thinking questions. He hits upon a few undeveloped billion-dollar ideas, and those are the reason to read this book."
1,Don't Even Bother!!!,"I have been struggling for a while to get through the written exams and oral interviews within different police agaencies here in Texas. So, one day (just recently) I decided to purchase 3 books to help me to prepare for up coming exams. When it comes to this book... Don't even bother. It is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Unless yopu need paper for the out house or for the bird cage... Then, I might suggest this book. But I do strong suggest Barron's: Police Officer Exam by Donald J. Schroeder & Frank A. Lombardo or Norman Hall's Police Exam Preparation Book. I cannot say enough about these two resources. But! As for this wasted purchase... I tell you what... Take the love of your life out instead. You'll be better off."
2,Many Errors,"Bought this book to study for the Police Officer Exam. It does have a lot of useful information, but is also full of mistakes. The worst being an entire page of one of the exams is missing.Most of the mistakes appear to have occured when the book was upgraded to the new edition. They have changed material in the questions but not the answers or vice versa.An example is in Practice Exam 4, you have to add words into blank spaces in a paragraph, ensuring the word has the same number of letters as the number of spaces. In one sentence the correct answer is given as 'lawbreakers' but the blank space has 9 letters and 'lawbreakers' has 11 letters. ('Criminals' fits the spaces and the context but is marked as incorrect.) There are many more errors. Find a more accurate study guide."
4,Roberto Cavalli perfume,"[[ASIN:B001QXBY6E Roberto Cavalli By Roberto Cavalli For Women Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5-Ounce Tester]This was the first time I had ever ordered perfume online. I'm glad I did! Great savings on a great perfume. I love it.Next time I need some, I'll be checking Amazon.com!"
3,Great for Pre schoolers,"I thought it really tought the kids about shapes, colors, the ABC's and the 123's"
2,Story of the Reagan Presidency as a Failure,"I purchased this book to get a sense of why Reagan was so successful as President and so fondly remembered by so many. Lou Cannon's book presents Reagan as a bumbling fool. After reading this book you will get a sense that Reagan failed at everything he did and Americans should look to the Carter administration as the definition of success for presidential administrations. Cannon may have seen Reagan close up as a reporter over decades, but after reading this book, the author never seemed to grasp or understand why Americans liked Reagan. If anything, this book unintentional highlights the disconnect between journalists and Americans through Reagan."
3,"Reagan, as you knew him, but with little more","Cannon offers bio that draw heavily from what you received from watching the media. It does not offer a great deal beyond that, and as a result is little more than a good summation of what people where saying at that time, and not even a balanced view at that. It is well written, but not very insightful. If you want insight into Reagan, get his journal or a copy of his diaries. Those provide much more insight into the man. This book pales in comparison, but is still fun. Get it if you can find it for a song."
5,It's like Reagan Said.,"My friends bet me that I could not read a whole book on President Reagan. I did it! And, I throughly enjoyed it even though it took me several months. Cannon is obviously a great reporter and a masterful writer. His book had an unexpected effect on me. It taught me how to love Reagan as a brother; actually more of an uncle; in spite of the politics. Sounds schmaltzy but it's the truth. Every chapter seemed to remind me of one of Reagan favorite old sayings ""hate the sin and love the sinner.""My hunch is that Cannon has defined the Reagan legacy for History and I am very glad he has done this for us."
4,The definitive Reagan Presidential account...,"Finally, a book that tells the Reagan Presidential story as it should be told...I've always suspected that Reagan's term was successful more due to the outstanding appointees/staff that he had through most of his 8 years in office (McFarlane, Poindexter, North notwithstanding) than with his own leadership skills...I can very definetly see Reagan asleep at a Cabinet meeting or getting over-run with bad decisions from the afore mentioned individuals, and have trouble en-visioning him being the great world leader that he's always made out to be. I think that people like Shultz and Weinberger and Carlucci and Powell were the drivers for this administration and Reagan generally sat back and watched and this book steers you in that direction more than any I've read. You should read all the popular accounts of the Reagan administration, but I'll bet this book tells the real story and kudos to Cannon for having the nerve to write it."
4,balanced and informative,I was surprised that given Cannon's closeness to the Reagans he could write a book that was very objective and at times unflattering towards its subject. It also provides interesting information about Reagan's earlier life without being too touchy-feely.
1,"Paul Poetzsch, Charlotte Nc",Lou Cannon is never without sources for this book because he could always ask the Urban Institute or any other liberal friends at the next desk at The Washington Post. If Mr. Cannon really got desperate for a dollar he could turn to Ben Bradlee. Enough said. Even to the last of over 800 pages he still bashes President Reagan. Save your money because this is totally biased liberal slant and a waste of paper.
1,Pathetic Hogwash,"This book is filled with blatant lies, half-truths and hearsay. There is nothing credible to this guy's ludacris accusations and slander. If you are a thinking person then put this book down and save yourself the trouble of reading this liberal hatchetjob. But if you believe aliens are stealing your thoughts, JFK and Elvis are still alive and dogs are telepathic then this is the book for you."
1,Lou Cannon doesn't know as much as he thinks.,Cannon missed most of the points that could be made about Reagan and his presidency. This book was undoubtedly read by dozens.
3,car spotters guid,"not a bad book, but its missing a few cars. don't buy it if you like chevy nova's. some cars are out of order. not mr.burness's best book, i have some of his old ones."
5,very good reference,I enjoy using this book as a very good reference guide. Mr. Burness's work is excellent.
5,car lovers,If all types of cars are your passion this is the book for you. My husband has one and I bought one for a friend too.
1,If You Like Pictures!!!!!!!!!!!!,Well I thought I would get something worthwhile with this book? But if I want pictures I would go look at family albums. No info on the cars thats worth a dag. I am glad I used my free credit to get it because it is only worth $0. Now I guess if I can find one up to date like the Old Cars publications did for the 1946-1975 by Krause publications then it will be worth the bucks.Duke in NC age 61
5,Varied and simple recipies,"If you like meatless burgers this book will show you how to make ones as good as the ones in the store, but that are significantly cheaper. The recipes are easy and quick. Nutrition information is included. The are a variety of recipes for using soy, wheat gluten, beans, grains, or vegetables to make burgers. If you have a problem with a particular ingredient you will find at least a few recipes that avoid using that ingredient. Included are recipes for side dishes. It is not high cuisine, but the recipes in this book are satisfying, tasty, easy and cheap."
4,mmmm...burgers,"I love veggie burgers, so this was a wonderful addition to my collection, the only problem was that it wasn't biig enough :)"
1,this book was given away,"I love a good veggie burger, and make all sorts. I am always out for new recipes, and constantly experimenting with things. So when i saw this book, i thought i would give it a try.Traditionally i have classified veggie burgers into 2 realms, those that taste like meet, but dont have the consistency, and those that feel like meet but dont taste like it.This book creates neither.... I have never done so much work, and gotten such odd ingredients for such a rotten return.If you are not a vegetarian, but rather a carnivore looking for an alternative to a regular hamburger, I would suggest looking elsewhere. The burgers in this book just don't cut it."
3,"Soy, soy, soy","Of the 49 burger recipes in this book, only 12 are soy-free. For those of us with soy allergy, and it tends to be a bad one, this is a poor ratio. It would have been helpful if the book description had included some information about this balance. It's about time the ""health food"" machine started giving us allergics a little consideration!"
2,And the rave is....???,"This book is tiny, is not even if alphabetical order, and has like four or five pages. What are the other reviews talking about? Maybe for 12 months and younger... if that is listed as such and I totally missed that, forgive me and ignore this review... :/"
5,best hojicha i've had!,"I love green teas and this hojicha is an excellent roasted one for a tea bag. It has a very full, round, and warm body to it, and a really flavorful nutty roast. It has the most wonderful aroma when brewing. AND it's an excellent cold tea for the summer! I brew my tea strong which can often lead to bitterness with green tea once it gets cold. But the nutty roast of this hojicha cuts out any bitterness. I love it because I can have this tea all year round, hot or cold!And with Amazon's subscription discount, it is far cheaper than what I have to pay per box in the store."
3,Old Reliable Photos...Rough Trade,"Not the best coffee table book I've seen, but worth having at the right price. It's a photo history of ""rough trade"" going back to the '70's, of men found on the street or in bars of San Francisco and Los Angeles willing to pose nude for David Hurles. It contains some interesting characters and some hot men."
4,Trip down memory lane,"No pretty boys here! I had seen Hurles' photos for years, often not knowing anything about them. It was fun to learn the history and some of the names behind those photos I remember so well. My only complaints are that the essays are just a little too short and a tad on the fluff side and that the photos are printed in black and white instead of color."
1,Speeding: The Old Reliable Photos of David Hurles,"Very disappointing, mostly due to the design of the book. The cover was the best graphically, but inside layouts are amature at best. The designer didn't work with the archival quality of the images at all. This could have been a really special tribute to the Old Reliable video series, but is fell way short. Hence, I returned the book promptly."
1,"European format, not American format","It said it was the American DVD player format, but turned out to be the European format, and therefore, would not play on my DVD player at all!I had to return it for a refund. Be careful."
2,"Flash Boredom-My ""only watched once""DVD will be up for sale","Ok I read the reviews and bought the DVD. After a couple of episodes, the kids said, ""This [is bad] Dad"" and they left the room. They were right. The acting, storylines and effects?? are boring. ""Ming the Merciless"" is nothing but an old dishrag. I guess if you are of the generation that still finds ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" movies entertaining then this DVD is for you. ..."
3,Mongo madness,"Well, this was my first exposure to the original Flash Gordon serial, after seeing clips of it for years and watching the laughably-bad 1980 feature film. I have to say that although I'm not ready to proclaim it a ""classic,"" I was certainly entertained for four hours. And wasn't that really the point of this short films back in the early days of sound cinema? They packed plenty of action, colorful characters and outrageous situations into each 20-minute chapter.As a lifelong science-fiction fan, I got a campy kick out of the ""science"" in this one. My favorite line from the opening chapter: As Dale Arden begins to have trouble breathing as the rocketship carrying Flash, Zarkov and her blasts from Earth's atmosphere, Zarkov apologizes thusly, ""Sorry...in all the excitement, I forgot to turn on the oxygen.""If you don't mind leaving your brain at the door, or get a nostalgic thrill from such lurid theatrics, you could do a lot worse than this first Flash series."
4,Classic Cliffhanging on the Planet Mongo,"Universal's 1936 production of ""Flash Gordon"" remains among the all-time classic serials. The chapterplay's influence on ""Star Wars"" is readily evident during the 13 episodes of sci-fi action and spectacle. Buster Crabbe made his mark in cinema history as the heroic Flash - and the same goes for Charles Middleton's Ming the Merciless. ""Flash Gordon"" cannot match the best Republic cliffhangers, yet it's terrific fun."
2,poor quality,The print/paper quality of this book is very poor. It seriously detracts from what is already a not so engaging story.
1,Not happy,Did not receive the product for several months. When it did come it was a xeroxed copy and not a spiral bound book. The DVD was not professionally done either.
2,Order takes forever. Ordered in August. Still don't have it. Waiting. . . .,"I ordered this CD in August and I still don't have it. So, if you are in a hurry to get this, don't order it."
3,The end of 17!,"I give this one only 3 stars. It was alright, but some parts were slow. The battle between Piciilo and #17 was pretty dull, and #16 vs. Cell was ok. The reason I gave it a 3 was the awesome part where #17 was ""eaten"" by Cell. So, might be worth a buy."
1,Deflated,"The product arrived with a hole we could not find. We bought this with several other toys for a pool party we were throwing. The adults eventually laid it out on the patio and used it to sit on so their swimsuits wouldn't snag. I saw in other product reviews that it showed up with a hole, and I took a chance anyway. My bad."
5,Take me home turtle,"We played with this turtle at a friends house before deciding we wanted one for out pool too. I have a seven year old boy, four year old girl, a husband and four kids in the neighborhood who love this toy. They place it on the edge of the pool and slide down on their bellies like a slide. They jump on it and lay on it. They climb on it and we are talking boys ages 7 and 9. I love it because they love it. It was worth the money. It took about a week to get here and we used an air compressor to blow it up. You can not flip this over..at least we haven't been able to. When my husband lays on it, the kids climb on him and all over it. Its pretty durable."
4,Intex Sea Turtle Ride On,"I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It is not only cute, but pretty durable. Overall, I like it very much. I only have one issue. For some reason, maybe sun-screen, the color transferred from the raft to my boyfriends skin. He turned green! Luckily, the green pigment washed away easily."
5,Great,This is a great toy. very durable. Only complaint is that one side doesn't seem to fill up like the other.
5,Sea Turtle floatie,"I love this product! Honestly im probably too old for this product, but i went on a camping trip and brought this. 4 of my friends layed across it at once and it didnt rupture or break. So i would Say this is pretty durable, so if it can hold 4 people over 100 pounds it would be great for children. It doesnt really have a educational value because its a floatie so that question doesnt make sense. Overall this is a 5, its cute,durable, and fun."
2,It Did not Last Long.,"It only lasted a week, then there's a 1"" tear between the edge of the neck and shell, it was fun to use when it works."
2,not durable at all-lasted 2 weeks,"It got a hole in it after 2 weeks. My grandkids love it, but it's already done for. the patch that was included did not work."
3,Too Big for small kids,This pool/lake toy is too big for kids and maybe even adults to get on and off. The only way is at the edge of the water and then a bit difficult to stay on.It is also very time consuming to inflate/deflate taking over 15 minutes.The alligator is a much better selection
5,"Real big, real fun",Tis is big enough for an adult to lay on and lounge. I have it in my pond and already had fun this summer.
1,"Decent concept, very poor quality","I liked the cover, Content is average, and the DVD and case are very poor quality. Received both the original and replacement with yhe disc loose in the case... The seller admitted it is a known issue with the manufacturer that the spindles are defective... Rated the seller negative for knowingly sending defective items and will NEVER DEAL WITH SINCLAIR AGAIN... The NERVE knowingly sending DEFECTIVE products!!! Waste of Good Money. GTHRC......"
2,mutual referrals for fun and profit,"This book is well organized and has descriptive chapter titles. However, the insights and techniques offered are fairly lightweight.This book is a guide to creating a network of people in non-competing businesses who agree to refer clients to each other. I was dissapointed to find that aside from mutual back-scratching, there were zero insights on how to get people to talk about my business. Isn't that what word-of-mouth is supposed to be about?In general, I found few surprises in the book. A lot of it struck me as ""Dale Carnagie"" style advice, pointing out that you should try not to sulk in the corner when at business gatherings, etc.To end on a positive note, I wholeheartedly agree with the auther's choice of title, seeing as how the ideas in this book are well known to most adults with average social skills."
5,..Revolutionizes and simplifies ANY marketing strategy!,"The World's Best Known Marketing Secret is the best book I have found that identifies and demonstrates the ""how-to's"" of developing an effective referral marketing strategy. Many books that I have read on marketing ""philosophize"" about how marketing strategies ""should"" work, and then don't outline specific methods that apply to my business. This book is a step-by-step results oriented handbook that I refer to OFTEN and apply directly to my situation. The results of developing my own plan, using the strategy outlined in this book, have been phenomenal in getting me continuous referrals for my business. I highly recommend that every business owner not only read this book, but DO the exercises outlined."
5,Excellent resource for sales professionals,"Dr. Misner does a very good job communicating the technique, philosophy and mindset of growing your business through referrals and word-of-mouth marketing. From Chambers of Commerce & community networking, to building long-lasting, trusting relationships, this book book reads like the bible of referral marketing! It is definitely a REQUIRED READING for all of our sales professionals as well as employees. By reading this book, everyone in our organization has learned the skill & mind-set for 'listening for referrals.' --HIGHLY RECOMMENDED--Jeremy M. Allen CEO, OnSite Computer Services"
5,"A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO ""NETWORKING IN THE REAL WORLD""","THIS WAS A WELL LAYED OUT STRATEGY OF NETWORKING YOUR BUSINESS THRU ""WORD OF MOUTH"". IT'S THE BEST BOOK ON NETWORKING I'VE EVER FOUND. IT TAKES YOUR ALL THE WAY FROM THE BASICS TO DEVELOPING A WHOLE MARKETING STRATEGY BASED ON WORD OF MOUTH. THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES I'VE ADAPTED INTO MY BUSINESS IMMEDIATELY THAT ARE WORKING. THIS IS A STRUCTURED NETWORKING PROGRAM THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP IN YOUR BUSINESS TO MAKE REFERRALS COME TO YOU EFFORTLESSLY."
5,Easy reading...Easier application of the material,"This book provides a broadscale approach to business growth through easy-to-use ideas and ""devine guidance."" You'll find chapters to be short, but still jam packed with tips and techniques that are very sensible and results-oriented. Anyone wanting a no-nonsense approach to business growth will be thrilled with this marvel. I have friends and associates that will credit reading this book, and working the BNI system, to the growth of their business into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The book has also given some keys ideas about growing my business and making important contacts as I work to complete my first book project. You definitely do not want to miss the impact it can have on you and your business!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Cranes are Flying is an absolutely gorgeous movie, with excellent cinematography and direction, but it's very manipulative at times, often unrealistic (it's wartime in Russia but everyone seems well-fed and clothed) and the characters don't always seem fully fleshed-out--if you're interested in Russian cinema then see it but don't expect a masterpiece, photography excepted."
3,"great cinamatography, two-dimensional characters","I'll begin this review with the caveat that I'm not a fan of old movies. This was the first old Russian movie I've seen.Made immediately post-Stalinist times, the film has some beautifully conveyed scenes. It is realistic in its portrayal of war as a harsh and deadly activity, refusing to give in to glorification.But the film failed to captivate me, mainly because the characters lacked a depth that allowed me to be caught up in their lives and stories. They seemed two-dimensional, like paper cutouts. Viewers are given only a brief look at Veronica and Boris and their relations before the war. The rest of the film emphasizes what happened to them and their relationship after the war began. The lack of initial character depth at the beginning made it difficult to feel strongly for them later in the film.Interesting as an example of 1950s Soviet filmmaking, but this is not the best film to see for a captivating story."
5,"Magnificent Film, Magnificent DVD","CRANES is known to most film students as the first major post-Stalin success of the Soviet film industry -- but the picture's vastly more enjoyable than that dry statistic would suggest. Lyrical and rhapsodic, this film benefits greatly from a director, cameraman and actors who don't shy away from the extravagant gesture, the romantic moment, or the juice inherent in melodrama. Viewers will be swept away by a poignant love story and its operatic manner of telling, from a joyful, playful opening to the bittersweet conclusion. The screenplay's also a fascinating mix of the romantic and cynical -- what a breath of fresh air this film must have seemed to audiences in its original release, with their memories of the suffering hidden behind the recent war's heroic facade. This DVD transfer's exceptionally good, even for Criterion -- CRANES wears its age lightly here, the film looks new-minted. If you're unfamiliar with this classic, don't hesitate to snatch it up."
5,The Cranes are Flying,"A black and white movie, but very clear images. Like other famous movies about the pain caused by the war, this movie is also emotional, made people thinking on the love and war, war and peace, hero and fear... I like it as the movie ""A farewell to arms""."
2,These smell terrible.,"I just can't get over the smell of these things. I had to go out and buy a different product. I love Quantum stuff but these don't do it for me. Once you wipe this on your arms and legs, you won't get able to get that smell off your hands. Stick with their spray. It seems to have a different formula."
5,"A central, reference text on the subject","This book is a central, reference text on the subject, the collapse of the Soviet Union. As such, it has been abundantly reviewed by leading specialists, some of which share similar opinions, whereas some others' are very different (Betty Smith, Ivan Ivanov, Bahman Azad, Michael Parenti, Mohammad Ali Amooii, Eleni Bellou, Francisco Melo, etc.) But this position and role of the book also explains why it has been translated so quickly into, and published in so many other languages: Bulgarian, Russian, Persian/Farsi, Greek, Portuguese, Turkish and French."
1,Ripped off,"This item was a ripoff. It is advertised as a full size replica helmet at 73% off, you will receive a mini helmet at a higher price than you could have paid anywhere else. The mini helmet itself is a nice helmet, just not what I paid for.The seller (Online Sports) claims it was Amazon who gave the wrong description and after waiting a week for a response they best they could do would give me a 20% discount on a helmet I already overpaid for or return it. Remember when there was customer service and companies actually took responsibility for their mistakes. I want what I paid for, I want what was advertised and I want to pay the advertised price.Do NOT buy from Online Sports on Amazon, they will only take your money and run"
5,Need More,"Hey Jim, This is Brian Previsky. I am not sure if you remember me or not. I used to go to all the Black Sunday shows too. You gave me a cd of tributes that you guys did. That was also great. There is only one problem. The label is falling off and the cd skips now. Is there anyway possible that you will be releasing that too. If not send me some info on how to get 1. Hey look forward for you to be doin some new stuff too. C-Ya soon, B"
3,product artwork is not as shown,Luna Fantasie Midsummer Night's Eve Acoustic Guitarproduct artwork is not what is shown in image - artwork is Green/yellow with 2 faires wearing yellow dresses - not the black/white image with 2 topless maidens shown - still a nice product - looks nice - I decided to keep but just a warning.freezeframe
3,Not what it looks like,"Well from the seller I got it from. The picture shows a very different book. I recieved maybe and older version not sure. It's hard cover,but all gray all around no picture on the front. The book however is great condition,doesn't tell you to much about personality traits,but does give good info and pictures on the look of the cat and the mechanics of cats in general. I have read better more informed books on cat breeds peeking inside any book if available online or in store a great idea. Still for the price can't complain to much just don't like seeing something I think I am getting and getting something different the picture should be changed for that retailer."
3,It's a gift,It is a gift and I have not given it yet. Would have preferred to have more pictures in it.
1,The logo washed off the first time I cleaned the hoodie.,"I've wanted this hoodie for years and finally ordered one, only to have it wear much much faster than any other hoodie I've ever owned. I washed it before wearing it the first time and sadly, the logo was 1/4 worn off after ONE WASH!it's very poorly printed and not worth what I paid for it.I'd go with a REAL hoodie company I you're looking for quality.This item was a real let down :("
4,The Projectionist DVD,"I found the DVD is good condition, the movie as enjoyable as when I saw it in the theaters many years ago."
2,WE LOVE RODNEY!,"This was a tough movie to follow, that is why I gave it 2 stars. This movie was a disappointment, it isn`t at all, anything like his other movies. We love Rodney Dangerfield. We collected all his movies thru the years and they were all hysterical. Just for this one. This one just drags on and on. I don`t recommend buying this one. All the other movies with him, are SUPER FUNNY, Typical Rodney Humor!!"
2,disappointed,Battery didn't seem to hold a charge for very long. Decided to buy my mom a new phone which I did not want to do. Her memory is going and I wasn't sure she could learn how to use a different cell phone.
3,You get what you pay for,"Ordered two. One worked fine. The other didn't work at all. It didn't seem worth it to send it back. Besides, I keep hoping my wife will get rid of this antique phone. Having two working batteries just encourages her to keep it."
1,Buyer Beware,"I received my battery in a timely manner so no issue with the delivery. However, it wasn't new and didn't work ... simple as that. Low price means I just can't be bothered to send back."
1,cheap... and it shows,"While hardly inexpensive, they are cheaply made. I like the longer pull strapbut that's it. The picture doesn't depict what you get; The visibility piping is non-existent, and the Velcro started falling off after opening the pouch the first time. My daughter could do a better stitching job as a 9 year old than the manufacturer did with these."
2,My opinion about this book,"I believe that many british naval historians think that the history of the Royal Navy and its ships is the only chapter of the world's naval history which deserves to be analyzed and written. This book is an excellent example.It deals with some of the first submersible ships. The submarines described are mainly british or those built by other countries considered potential challengers of the British Empire. The rest are dismissed with little more than a few words or simply ignored. Even then, the best descriptions are mostly anecdotical, so you can find in this book descriptions of the bedroom behavior of members of the british royal family or George Washington's dental prostheses. If you are really interested in serious books about submarines you will find several of them in this excellent website. This is definitely not one of them."
4,This is an okay collection,"I had expected it to be a little bit better ... but all in all, I guess it is a decent collection to Christmas songs."
5,An excellent book regarding Neural network applications,"Those involved in Neural networks especially the ones who are in to pattern recognition research MUST buy this. It explains in a rather friendly and explicit way, the areas to which neural networks should be applied, as also the areas where ANN might not be so useful."
5,LIKE BEING SHOT WITH A MACHINE GUN... POLITELY!!!,"As the name implies, this album is like getting riddled full of bullet holes, but you don't really mind because the culprit does it with class and style and charms you to death first. The Damned had refined their punk onslaught on this platter, mixing bombastic rat-a-tat punk with sing-along melodies, psychedelic organ, and ambitious song structures. The Damned sound as nihilistic as any of their contemporaries on this album, but you have to give them the edge: whereas the Clash sounded like they want to take over the world with their political rhetoric, the Damned sound like the world's exploding, and they're the evil clowns hired to entertain at our last big shindig. This could be the single best punk album to come out of the 70's... absolutely smashing. Standout tracks include ""I Just Can't Be Happy Today"", ""Love Song"", ""Machine Gun Etiquette""."
5,Damned In The 70's 3,"After two great albums featuring the line up of Dave Vanian, Rat Scabies, Captain Sensible, and Brian James, The Damned broke up. Only to reunite shortly after with ex-Saints bassist Algy Ward replacing Brian James under the name of The Doomed. Shortly after, the new name was droped and The Damned (rightfully) became the band's name again. With out James the band was free to write thier own music, and that freedome led to the release of ""Machine Gun Etiquette"" which contains some of the band's all time best work, including ""Love Song"", ""I Just Can't Be Happy Today"", ""Plan 9 Channel 7"" and ""Smash It Up"" wich was covered (horribly) by The Offspring on the ""Batman Forever"" soundtrack. This CD also contains four great songs not included on the vinyl LP. Overall, this is the best Damned album out there, so if you want to see what this band can do, start with this CD."
4,A Great Deal for the Dollars,"I have just listened to and read the accompanying book in this set. Both are extremely good, especially for the price. The book contains the full libretti of both operas as well as the 2 CD's. The singers are Franco Corelli, Victoria de los Angeles, Tito Gobbi and Mario Sereni - an excellent cast for these ""verismo"" operas."
4,"Great book, but quirky and unconventional, like Mr Wiliamson","This is the first fiddle book I bought, some 10 years ago, and I still go back to it for something different on occasion. It has 100 or so tunes, a lot of which are rare these days. This is not a book that will help you to play in celtic music sessions, as the tunes are mostly obscure, and if they are common, Robin always has to throw in some wild variation, or change the tune slightly. His choice of chords is better than anything I've seen in more conventional celtic fiddle books. He teaches the basic ornamentation, and each tune has a paragraph written about it. The record, now a cd, is helpful to learn his stylings and the tunes but only covers a small amount of the tunes printed, 20 maybe. This book has great personality and is much more interesting than the sterile massed produced tune books of today.My only complaint is that I wish it had more tunes in the book and more tunes on the record."
4,This explains a lot,"Fathers of daughters with eating disorders need help understanding the disorder and how to overcome their frustration with not being able to ""fix"" their daughter. This book opens the door to begin the process of restoring a more normal and effective role for the father.While not the most ""user friendly"" writing style for the non-professional, it is easily understood and offers much information to help men (and the women they love) deal effectively with everyone impacted by the eating disorder...themselves, their spouse and, most importantly, their child.Although I am a physician, I am also the father of a daughter with an eating disorder and read this book upon the advice of her therapist. I am very glad to say that it has started my daughter and me on a path to a much richer relationship and that she is on the road to recovery."
5,Now I know why...,The title of the book caught my eye while I was looking through an eating disorders booklet. The author managed to put into words all the confusion and heartache a girl can go through if she does not have a positive relationship with her father. I had no idea how important the father/daughter relationship was or how deep the emotional scars can be by not having a good one. I would highly recommend this to any daughter who has eating issues and a problematic realationship with her father or any parent trying to understand their daughter's eating disorder. I simply cannot say enough about how this book has positively affected my life.
5,"Insight for fathers, as well as daughters","I ordered this book to help better understand myself when I started recovery from anorexia nervousa. Reading this book was like looking at my childhood through a mirror. I highlighted parts of the book that I felt described the relationship I always wanted with my father, but was never able to have. Someday I will share it with him, but untill then I have shared it with my husband. This book gave my husband a deep appreciation for the role he plays in our daughters lives, and has made him become aware of how his words and actions, however innocent, can have such a lasting impact on their self-worth. I recomend it to all women who have struggled with addictive behaviors: eating disorders, alcoholism, masacism. I also recommend it to anyone who loves someone who suffers from these devistating diseases, husbands, fathers, brothers alike. You can't help if you don't understand, and no book has gone deeper into the darkness of these diseases."
4,Change of pace for Bronson.,"I have watched this Charles Bronson movie several times and enjoy it more each time. On first viewing, it's hard to see Bronson in a straight acting role in the same vein as Lola or Someone Behind The Door, which are two excellent straight acting Bronson movies. Some reviewers have pointed out that this movie is very similar to Casablanca. On this point I can not comment as I have never watched Casablanca. Cabo Blanco for me was a good movie that I never found boring. It also features an enjoyable performance from Jason Robards who also appeared with Bronson in Once Upon A Time In The West. If you are more of an action man Bronson fan then you may be disappointed with this.As for the DVD transfer, the picture quality and sound is for the most part acceptable with some print damage evident at times but not to the extent that the movie becomes unwatchable. Maybe we will see a restored special edition in the not to distant future."
3,U. S. MARSHAL,The movie U.S. Marshal was not included on the dvd disc. The title was includedexcept the movie itself was not. The movie Cabo Blanco had most of the scenesrestored except some of the scenes were fair.
1,almost caught on fire,My puppy loved this for the first few days. Then I put it in the mircowave to heat it up like the instructions say and it started smoking and burnt a hole thru the material!
5,Puppy Love,"On my way to the check out counter I bought this nifty little invention. We were trying to find as many things as we could to make our 10 week old puppy more comfortable in her new home. All you have to do is undo the velcro on this, and stick the bag in the microwave for thirty seconds. Our puppy loves it. She cuddles and snuggles right up to it.NOTE: My current puppy is small and not a huge chewer. I had a Lab puppy once, and she would never have been able to sleep with this toy. Labs tend to be big chewers, and there is no doubt that a motivated puppy could get this little guy open and then you would have little pebbles everywhere!"
5,Heated Puppy Cuddle Pal,The product is great. Our puppy snuggled up to it the first night. We heated the pouch after removing it from inside the toy as directed and our puppy thought he was back with his litter. He didn't cry all night. This is an Amazon Verified Purchase.
5,Very good toy!,Our puppy loves this toy. It's by far the best toy we have puchased. Our dog bailey sleeps with it in her kennel and she plays tug-a-war with us during the day. It's durable and washes well. It's a great toy to have.
4,Great comfort for pup,"Our new pug puppy (9 weeks) loves this little pillow. It's actually large enough for him to rest his head on, and we usually use it as a way to keep him asleep when we need to move him off of a lap. I'm nervous about leaving him with it alone (due to the material inside), so we do not encourage using this as a chew toy as some others have suggested. Otherwise, it makes a great comfort for our pug pup and helps soothe him back to sleep after early morning wake-ups to go out."
2,Neutral territory.,"I have a tiny 4 pound Yorkie mix that I take everywhere. I purchased this product to use to keep him warm when I take him outdoors with me in his ""bag"". He does not care ~ normally he can be located on the opposite side of his bag than this warming pillow. Furthermore, I would have liked a bit more direction. It does not state how long to place the warmer in the microwave. I tried 1 minute & it started leaking fluid (?!?!?!). Then I tried 30 seconds & that seemed to do the trick but it does not retain the heat for longer than 20 minutes which is much shorter than the heating pads filled with dried corn, rice, cherry pits, etc made for people. All in all, I love most of the Petstages products but this one just doesn't do much for me or my little one."
5,Great cuddle pet toy,"I purchased this as a cuddle toy for our new puppy. I took it along when we picked up the puppy and I let his litter mates play with it for awhile (read that in a review). At bedtime, I warmed it up and placed it with the puppy. It worked like a charm, he slept though the night without a whimper! Now, 6 weeks later, its still his favorite toy and can really hold up to a chewer and many tug-o-wars. He does love to chew the back to try to get to the beans inside, so I just spray the seam with bitter apple and he leaves it alone.UPDATE October 2008: Well, it's STILL his favorite toy (and longest lasting!!). I did have to remove the beans because he discovered how to open the back, but he loves to play with this toy."
3,Concerns,I am not sure if I am going to give this to my puppy or to my adult dog instead. Puppies are avid chewers and this toy is filled with a type of bead. I am concerned the puppy will open it and choke on the pieces or at the very least get them all over the house.
2,ehhh its ok!,"The price is great compare to other retailers but unfortunately, The heat doesn't last long. It's cute and perfect size for puppies! My shih tzu puppy uses it as a pillow sometimes but most of the time, ignores it. Wouldn't repurchase!"
2,Not for big chewer...,I have 19 week old GR pup and in less than 4 hrs he manages to rip apart this product....may differ from dog to dog but i will not buy this product again...
2,Not what I expected,Awfully small. I have a Yorkie and it was like a pillow for one foot. I thought it would be like a bed pillow. Very disappointing.
3,Not made for hyper active dogs,"I bought this for my baby yorkie and he is so hyper active that he was able to chew the opening and swallow it, I had to throw it out. It's too bad because I realy wanted him to love this toy as his buddy."
5,A favorite!!!!,We brought our new puppy home at almost 8 weeks and a little over 1 pound. We had Spot at the house waiting and it was like they had always been together! Spot is still her favorite toy many weeks later. So glad we bought this little puppy!
2,pet stages puppy cuddle pal,"did I like it, no , not for the cost, they just ignored it, and the little ones just drug it around they won't sleep with it... they perfered a warm just out of the dryer soft blanket, would I buy again NO, would I recommend.... No not for the price...1.99 maybe."
5,Our favorite toy!,"This has been the most favored toy choice by our 4 year old schnauzer. He absolutely loves it. I think he would end up depressed if he actually destroys the last one. He loves to chew the ears and feet off, that's why we buy so many!"
4,Great Idea,"My newest puppy came to me from a shelter. His brother was also there and I thought it would be a good idea to put the pillow with them so that he would feel like he still had his litter mate when I brought him home. However the shelter didn't give me the opportunity to do this. So that really defeated the purpose for which I was buying this toy. Either way, I still used it with my puppy. For a while at night when it was bedtime I would warm the little sack of buckwheat inside for a few seconds, then place it back in the toy, and tuck it into his crate with him. He liked laying on it for the first week but now he mostly ignores it. Every once in a while he chomps the tail but he's not that into it. So now it's just tucked into his box of toys. It not really an expensive toy but for a week of use it wasn't worth it."
3,Cute Puppy Toy,"I bought this toy because I have a puppy that is always cold so the fact that you can heat this up was a plus. It does heat up, but doesn't stay warm very long. The buckwheat pouch inside is only protected by velcro. My puppy has figured out how to open the velcro and pull the pouch out. It's a great concept, but it needs to be harder to open so it can be left with puppy unattended."
1,Poorly made,This dog toy is very poorly made. My puppy had the bag in the middle out in about 5 minutes and shredded it apart in about 10 minutes. Very poorly made.
5,"Very cute, smallish, puppy likes!","First, this toy is about as big as a large hand: if you are under the impression that it is large enough for a weaned puppy to lie on, look elsewhere! It is not a mat, but more of a small, flat, squarish stuffed animal. It might be small enough for a very young puppy, though ~ one not yet weaned.That said, our puppy loves it. I gave it to the breeder to handle before taking new puppy home ~ as another reviewer suggested ~ and puppy was very sniffily pleased to encounter the warmed cuddle pal before her first bedtime in her new home.We warm this each night and while I can't say it has ""soothed"" her in any noticeable way, puppy loves to shake and wrestle with this toy during playtime."
2,Chew toy!,This was purchased for our Golden Retriever puppy. She was only 8 weeks old when we received it. Would probably work for small dogs but our dog tore it to pieces in a few weeks time. Would make a great chew toy but there are a lot of tiny pieces of material inside. Debris was everywhere.
2,Doesn't hold heat,"This product is supposed hold several hours of heat for a puppy to snuggle with, but it cooled off completely within 15 minutes. I couldn't believe it! It's a shame, because it's cute and well-made. I think I'll buy the snuggle-safe heat pad instead, which reputably holds 8 hours of heat.It's also smaller than it appears--about the size of a 6""x8"" note card."
2,Did not live up to expectations,"I was excited about getting this for my golden puppy I was about to bring home. She however did not want anything to do with it. The idea of warming it up for comfort seemed great, but she would not snuggle with it, even in her crate. She occasionally will chew on it a bit but that's all. Seems to be made well though."
3,Cute,"If your pup like to be up against warm thigs, this is the one to get. It can be heated and stays warm for about 10 - 20 minutes. If you have a curious pup like mine, they will try to tear it apart."
3,THIS TOY FOR A PUPPY,"ITS OK, BUT HE HAS NO USE FOR THE HEATING PURPOSE. HE LOVES TO PLAY WITH IT BUT NOT WARM. NOT THE BEST TOY."
3,For Small Puppies,I failed to read the dimensions in the description. This little guy is cute and a great idea but I have a german shepherd puppy and this barely caught his attention as more than a chew toy.Makes a great hand warmer for human though :)I'd say it's definitely for miniature dogs.
1,Bad Product,This product is made with BUCKWHEAT. According to the ASPCA Buckwheat is toxic to dogs! If your pet ingested this contact your local veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at 888-426-4435. Following is a link to ASPCA site [...]
3,Not a star performer and doesn't last long,I had this receiver for about 2 years before it died.Movies sounded fine with this however the clarity of sound was poor (characteristic of SONY). I didn't know how good my JBL speakers could sound until I bought a new receiver to replace this one (only 2yrs old!!!!)My biggest complaint with this thing was that it completely died after ~2yrs of using it ~1hr per day!Do yourself a favor and purchase a Pioneer or Yamaha receiver that will not only sound better but they should last for 10+ years!!
3,Solid receiver,"I've had this thing in constant user for near a decade. It's now the weak link in my system and due for replacement, but it's still working hard and sounding the same as it did when I bought it. Not much more I could have expected out of it for the price I paid for it, maybe $200, years ago."
2,Poor Music Quality,"Just bought this unit yesterday. The shop only test with DVD movie and I forgot to test for CD audio.The bass and treble really does not get out, and the music really feels flat, no low and high output. Can only set the tone (bass and treble) to 6db max. Disappointing.Not recommended to play music."
4,Wonderful book -- reminiscent of The Red Tent!,"I wish that more Bible stories were written in this context. Certainly, it's fiction, but I think we are encouraged to use our ""sanctified imaginations"" a little bit. This is a wonderful book, and we're going to use it for a women's book study at our church."
5,Excellent choice for a book discussion,This book is wonderful. The women's guild at my church featured it as a topic of a book discussion last year. We had the pleasure of taking part in a telephone conference with the author Obery Hendricks. He was very gracious. It was a wonderful experience. The reader gets an understanding of how women and minorities were marginalized in society during Biblical times.
4,Great,I liked the romance between the two main characters and I like that they both were hiding their true identies. This was a great futuristic romance.
4,bigger than expected,"This mobile is bigger than I expected. As a result, I haven't been able to use it right away. I thought it was a crib mobile. No. Then I tried hanging it from the ceiling, but it was too heavy for a little screw in hook. Now I'm waiting for my husband to devise a solution. It's still sitting on the floor in the closet six months after purchase ..........It is pretty, though. Next time I think I'll just buy a small, cheap, wind up musical one for the crib. The baby doesn't need any more than that anyways."
5,Dolly,Fantastic set with an accompaning booklet that is filled with information..I thought I knew everything there was about Dolly but soon found out I was incorrect.Love how the CD'S take her from her early days to the present...HER VOICE has done nothing but improve over the years.
5,Great Collection To Have,"A great Collection for any Dolly Parton Fan. Dolly has it all,beautiful looks,and a great voice ,from a small child till today. She's a great songwriter as well as a great singer. She can sing,Country,Pop,Gospel,and great Love songs,that will make you laugh and cry. This is one of the greatest collections to have,with all on her hits and some there were on her lp's."
2,I love Dolly Parton; Especially Early Dolly yet. . .,". . .I hate this box set. It was only worth the sale price I paid for it. Not even. It's just a dud. Shows nothing about Dolly's musical talent - geeeez, have you ever seen this woman pick/play?! - sorry, you can miss this set and I have no direction of where to go anymore to hunt down ""roots"" Dolly."
5,J Lo's back with full force with her recent hit!,"While it was majorly played out this past spring, I really enjoyed her duet with LL Cool J On ""All I Have."" The chorus is catchy and LL's raps are really good. The production courtesy of Corey Roony is excellent and the sampling of ""Loving Life and Life is Living!"" is really fun to sing along to. Catchy hooks and danceable beats give two thumbs up from me! This is her best collabo since ""Ain't It Funny Remix."""
5,ALL SHE HAS IS GOOD..,"2nd single, one of the best track cuts off her third studio album (+1 remix album)....the enitre album of THIS IS ME...THEN is GREAT! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT...Jennifer has improved as an artist, obvious growth is revealed in through her stronger vocals, excellent and more song writing and the production of the album itself is amazing...it creates a 70's mellow, soul r&b/pop vibe....it's really nice....From the first track 'still' to the last track ""baby I love you"" and the bonus track ""the one version 2"" is ALL GOOD.. This sinlge really isnt neccessary, but the acapella version and the instrumental version of the song are STILL really good...worth the money if you love the song out now on radio (in the US)...It's number one right now...Maybe it'll be a #1 in the UK....THe next single rumored is said to be ""the one"" or ""loving you"" which are both good anyway..."
3,catchy but overrated,the music is pretty and l l cool j did a fine job but if j lo didn't sound like a mouse the song would have been much better. I love the use of the sample. Hearing the song encouraged me to download the original sample.
2,Decent,"So far, this is her weakest single next to ""Jenny On the Block"". It is better than that ""Dirrty"" song. But, this does not measure up to ""Wating for Tonight"" or ""Play""."
1,Do people really like this song?,"You've got to hand it to Jennifer Lopez. No matter what song she releases, it'll always become a hit. But her last album had listenable songs at least. This song especially is just bad. First of all, it samples Debra Laws' ""Very Special"" for the umpteenth time, Jennifer sounds like...well, Jennifer, and LL's lyrics are very cheap (especially during the chorus). Next, please. (By the way, both of their latest albums are wack.)"
2,nearly 10% of answers in the answer key are wrong,"I like the format of this book, but the excessive number of mistakes in the answer keys (at least one wrong answer in each section!!) is beyond frustrating. If the author had just paid a small amount of attention to detail, I would give this book 5 stars.I would not fault a mathematician for poor spelling, but one who thinks 1 + 1 = 3 (problem number 18, page 191, Dr. Trivieri!!) deserves some criticism. In almost every unit, I was struggling with a problem or two that I kept getting wrong, only to find that I actually had the right answer and Dr. T was too lazy to go back and check his work. Customers deserve better!!!!"
5,A Great Book for Hockey Fans !,"This is a fine book for al fans of the National Hockey League. It's jam-packed with full-color photographs, profiles and stats of the brightest stars in the NHL including Jaromir Jagr, Eric Lindros, Dominik Hasek and Brett Hull. A must for all hockey fans. Up-to-date information too !"
3,"A decent drive, but in the rough",The ending is a bit of twist but overall an average read at best. If you are a golf fan looking for something different there are better books.
5,Fascinating - picks up where all the other L&C books leave off,"All too infrequently I find myself in the Fortunate possession of a book too Interesting to put down. ""The Fate of the Corps"" is one of those books. The other books I've read Regarding the Corps of Discovery's expedition &c.; always left me Wondering what became of the less well-known members. This book tells their Story in a highly Readable and captivating way.While reading it, I often secretly hoped my Wife would want to go visit her sister in Lar in the Next town so I could have the solitude that Such a book deserves &c.;This really is a great book - one of those that I was sorry to see end."
2,It's okay,"I wasn't expecting too much watch for this price but from the other reviews I thought I'd be getting at least a good deal. I was wrong.When you pop out to set the time, the minute hand flops around a teenie bit so when you set the time you have to be careful how you click the set knob back in or it can move the minute hand a little. Not very accurate and really annoying to me.However, yes, it's fine for the price I guess but I'm now looking for another pocket watch. It's not worth it for me to send it back so I'm donating it to a thrift store and spending more money this time for something with a bit more quality."
2,Not very well made,"The face of the watch moves around when you change the time. I also found the stem would pop up while it is in my pocket. That allows the time to stop. The chain is cool, but the craftsmanship is clearly sub par. It is real light and obviously cheap."
5,A classy edition to any classy dude or lady's ...class.,"I get complimented wherever I go now that I have a spiffy new pocketwatch. Whether people comment on the uniqueness, the shinyness, the ""retro"" factor, or just how classy it looks, I'm the proud owner of a new watch and receiver of much praise.It's a solid watch, for a terrific price. You can't really go wrong with it."
5,"Clarifying the ""Colourization"" Issue","It should be pointed out that many TV shows were filmed in colour, but broadcast in black and white. Such is the case with ""An Evening With Nat King Cole.""This program was NOT colourized after the fact, such as Ted Turner did to many black and white films.Yes, at the end of the program, there is a credit listed for colourization, but that has to do with the technical aspect of filming in colour. All colour films, especially those done in Technicolor, had colour specialists whose jobs included lighting,juxtapositioning of coloured clothing, furniture, sets, etc. Also, make-up had to be carefully adjusted so as to register on the screen as natural.""An Evening With Nat King Cole"" was filmed using a colour process that yielded extremely vivid and sharp colours, e.g. the old TV show Bonanza. So don't be dissuaded from purchasing this exemplary TV show if you think it was ""colourized."""
5,"Loved it then, Love it now!","I read this book first when I was 10. It read it many times as a teenager. I somehow lost my copy as a college student. 20 years later I was telling my friend about the book and my search for a copy of it. She surprised me for my 40th birthday with a copy, so now I can share my favorite book from my childhood with my own kids. Great read."
4,Reminiscing,Loved this book as a child. Enjoying it a second time. Can' wait to share with a new generation. I
5,An excellent read!,"I read this book years and years ago and absolutely loved it. I searched for it a few times but could never find it. Then, a few years back I ran across a copy at a book sale and snatched it up. I've reread it a couple of times since then and still find it as good a read as when I was younger."
1,Did not work at all,"Bought one string of these, and they never worked. Maybe just a bad set? Hard to say, but I won't be buying anymore."
4,"Quality lights, good price","Product was just as described, worked fine and arrived on time. Everything you hope for when shopping online."
5,great to get a Rossini disc from this great Rossini tenor,"Bruce Ford has made quite a name for himself singing Rossini, and it is wonderful to get some of his portrayals on this disc. It is nicely interspersed with duets and ensembles with other great singers, so it makes for a very enjoyable album which never gets boring (I found Florez' Rossini disc boring because it's the same voice for the whole disc)I listen to it all the time now in the car on the way to workDefinitely worth getting."
5,Timely and provocative,"The authors give extraordinary insight into the challenging environment in which Asian business leaders operate today. Rigorously researched, this is the indispensable guide to corporate globalization."
1,very poor,"Numerous factual errors, incomplete, rehash of the same old stories, it adds nothing new to interest the reader. The author has an obvious bias against Dale Earnhardt Sr. Example: Earnhardt's death was 10th most important fatality in NASCAR acccording to his book. More important ones to the sport were J.D. McDuffie and Michael Ritch."
3,a good video for beginners,"it's a good video, if you want to become a cheer- leader .I wish it would have given more info about jumps ,movements , stunts, streches,and gymnastics. they should have explain and did things slower so you could learn faster. but it focesed mostly on cheers and chants. If you are already on a cheer squad I dont recommend it to you."
2,Not Great for Cheerleaders!,"I thought that this video was very childish for those that are already cheerleaders. I can see how it would be good for those girls in Jr. High or Middle School who have never cheered before, but don't waste your money if you are in high school or have been a cheerleader for a while."
5,great jacket,this jacket looks great and keeps you warm during windy days. this jacket looks so good that people are jealous of my wearing it and one guy tried to ruin it by marking it with a white chalk. I didn't realized it until i got home if I found out i would have punch him in the face.
3,"I give it a C, but it is a fun diversion","Positives: Good storyline, rounded characters, and some thought is required to overcome the enemy. The unit upgrades one can purchase at towns are a nice feature and cause one to get attached to their units.Negatives: This game is has many bugs so be prepared for numerous crashes. The patches help, but they don't fix everything. You cannot name your saves, which is limiting. Also, the way the game works, the one who attacks first pretty much always wins - so the strategy becomes how one can arrange things to stay far enough away from the enemy to always attack first. And if you are ever in range of their spells, prepare to lose a lot of your army."
2,For practicing lens designers only,"I work in the electro-optics field, with a background in EE and laser resonators. Since I came from a electrical engineering background, I have sought to get more knowledge in the practical field of lens design beyond laser resonators and optical accesories. For that reason, bought this book, as well as the Virendra N. Mahajan series on Optics and Abberrations.Unlike that series, as well as the Siegman classic on Lasers, this book introduces many equations, terms, and plots, as well as glass catalog items, with very little in the way of introduction, derivation or even an explanation of terms. It is solely meant for a an experienced practicing lens designers only. I was very disapppointed in this book and its review. I found it was reviewed wrongly, for the level at which it should be purchased and read, quite disceptive as a result, even though I wam sure it was not unintentional."
4,Great driving C.D.,"I have been an avid queen fan since I was in my mothers womb. I have all of their albums save greatest hits 3 and alot of the rarities. I picked this one up only because of the ""new queen song"" No one but you and I have to say that it is the weakest song on the album. THe rest of the disc is great. Some new mixes (I'm in love with my car and I can't live with you) some old. But still a great disc to drive to. I can't tell you how many times I acidently do 85 in my car while listening to this disc."
1,I can tell it's bad,"I have never even listened to this cd, but I know all the songs (except the last one, which I will get with greatest hits 3). I also know that this is a queen complimation that no one needs. It's basically just a ""best of Brian May"" album. Personally, Freddie Mercury is my favorite member of queen, and his songs are the reason for it. Hardly any of his songs are on here. If I had to make a cd of all my least favorite queen songs plus a couple of decent ones for good measure-- this would be it. Even Mercury's songs that are on here aren't that good. If you need a queen complimation, get a greatest hits. Unless the only reson you like Queen is for their hard rock ones. They're pretty good, but it's not what Queen is all about"
3,Well...,"It's not _bad_, exactly, but I never would have sat through to the end if Mishima hadn't been in it. Overall, I think his performance is pretty solid, and so are the others in the film, but it's not really spectacular; there are better yakuza films out there. Any fan of Mishima should definitely see it, though, for novelty's sake, and bear witness to just how incredibly skinny his legs were."
4,Nice collection that gives one a feel for a hockey great.,"This book is a collection of articles concerning Tim Horton. Very complimentary of the man and player, the articles definitely give you a feel for the time and play of Tim Horton.Known to most of us because of the donuts (and they are really good!), this collection allows a glimpse of the man as well. I would recommend this book for those who want a feel for 50 and 60s hockey, as well as those who want the feel of the times."
1,Couldn't Be More Disappointed,I purchased this monitor as an upgrade to an e-Machines 15in. Monitor. The e-Machine is long since gone and I hooked the new Philips up to my very powerful Pentium 4 machine. The quality of the text and grapics on the lower half of the screen is the worst I've ever seen. It is as if you are looking through water.I called Philips support and got a Call Center in India. I found the support person to not be very knowledgeable and very hard to understand. They told me that it had to be interference caused by cordless phones and stereo speakers. I moved all possible problem sources and nothing changed. I will be buying NEC or Envision after I return this one.
1,Horrible Product/Company,"If I could give no stars I would. We recieved this as a gift. NEVER give this as a gift. The company terminates all warranty when given as a gift. When we opened the pool there was missing pieces which the company refused to replace. The inflatable ring has a leak, so there is no way to fill the pool. It is impossible to level the ground. They claim to have high quality control, but they refuse to fix any problems. Beware of this company."
5,WARNING - PLANNING PERMIT NEEDED !!!,"We purchased our pool three weeks ago and the kids are loving it.I was shocked to wake this morning to this Intex pool on the cover of our local paper. It seems that these pools require planning permit and adhere to proper state fencing laws. I'm disappointed that I wasn't informed of this at the time of purchase. The advertisement and product boxes never show or mention this, (...) I,m at a lose."
1,Waste of money,"My problem with this pool is that the pump is a piece of junk. It is NOT strong enough to circulate the water properly. If you go away for a few days and come back and your water is green or cloudy, it will cost you a fortune trying to get the water clear, if you ever do. The filter catridge has to be cleaned or replaced far too often. Keeping this pool clean is a way more expensive and time consuming job than a more expensive ""real"" above ground pool. I would venture in the long run, this pool ends up costimg more than a ""real pool""."
1,Intex EasySet Pool(s),"These pools are only as good as the top ring. When (and it is inevitable) the top ring starts leaking air, the end is soon. My pool, in its second year, started getting black spots in the upper ring. Those black spots lost their elasicity and started cracking, and then started leaking. Pool is unusable at end of second season."
3,holes in ring,"Over the past 4 years we have been through 2 of these pools. During the first year everything is great. At the end of the season we follow the storage directions (clean, dry, gently fold and store indoors)yet the following year we always have leaks in the blow-up ring we are unable to find. We end up having to inflate it daily. Yes, it was an Intex brand and yes we tried finding the leak (with soap and water and pressure)We really enjoy the ease and size, but buying a new one every other year is becoming quite costly. I hope this helps."
4,Cheap pool for budget,My husband and I bought this pool and had some trouble setting up. Trying to get completely level ground was difficult. We found that we were off by a few inches and are now starting to have trouble. The bottom of the pool has actually expanded so now the sides are bulging and my water level is about 6 inches too low. I called the manufacturer direct and they advised me to add more water to the pool. It does take a lot more then 15 minutes to set up and trying to get all of the wrinkles out of the bottom is another story. When it is all said and done I guess it is worth the money. Only time will tell how durable it is.
4,Ours lasted 6 years,"We had our pool for 6 years and really got our money's worth. However, the first time putting it up was the easiest. After that, we had a problem getting it to fill up evenly (we have a level yard). If you don't stand inside and work the wrinkles out (like the other person said),you will end up with a crooked pool (one side straight up, the other tilted ). We have had to empty it and refill it several times over the years. when the side goes straight up, it is much easier to collapse and pour water all over your yard. Our kids finally outgrew it, but it's a great pool for little kids."
5,GREAT summer fun,We bought this pool last year and spent the whole summer in it. We are a family of 4 and found it was the perfect size. The kids could have their friends over and there was plenty of room for all to play in it. It did take a little longer to set up than anticipated and the ground needs to be absolutely level but still worth the time and energy to do it right.
1,Buyer beware,"Terrible instructions. Easy Set... if the ground is PERFECTLY level it will be easy. Don't think your ground is level trust me it's not level enough for this pool. 4 weekends wasted. leveled the yard within 1/4"" or better and it spills over into the neighbors yard. Save your money.Warning: Do not buy this pool or anything that resmbles it."
2,Not Happy with this product,"I had this pool for 2 years and had nothing but problems with it. The pump is a total joke. My son hardly got to swim in it because I was always having to put chemicals in it. I had to empty the pool out and fill it up again 2 times during the summer, because I couldn't get it clean. Intex needs to up-grade the pump."
3,Easy set... sure! Easy stay? No way!,"Our family purchased and set up this pool just about 1 mo ago. We have thoroughly enjoyed being in it. The setup was quick and easy since our backyard is cement and there are no trees, etc. nearby. Our kids have really enjoyed it the most, as long as Dad has been able to figure out how to keep the chemicals adjusted (since it is a figure it out as you go plan). I'm glad it included a pump. Well, if you want to call it that. The pump is downright puny. We had to keep taking the filter out and rinsing it to get any strength out of it at all! This past weekend, we took a trip out of town, only to arrive home on Sunday to find the darn thing busted!!! It burst sometime over the weekend and flooded our yard, part of our family room, our garage and one of our neighbors yards!!! Although it was thoroughly enjoyable while it lasted, it sure didn't last long!..."
5,Don't let the other comments scare you off.,"This pool is great!! We read everyones' comments, we watched the video, and read the directions before starting to set up this pool. We prepped the ground where a former pool had been. Made it as level as possible and flattened the ground out. From the time we started to lay the tarp to the time we started to fill the pool was 15 minutes. My 12 year old daughter & I set this pool up. It wasn't filled with water until the next day, almost 4,000 gallons will not come out of a garden hose fast. Advice for making sure the pool is level....pay attention to where the water goes in the pool while you are filling it. If the water evenly distributes itself, then the pool is level. If you have a bunch of water at one end and none at the other, STOP, the pool is not level. Set it up right the first time and you will love this pool!!"
4,how to fix holes,"HI, as a 17 year above ground 28 ft pool veteran, i am looking into getting one of these pools for our own yard (since grandma moved). the reviews are promising. I too am concerned about the holes though. The best way to fix those kind of holes is to make a slurry of dish washing liquid and paint it on, you can use some red food coloring in it to help you make sure you dont miss a spot. the airholes will make bubbles you can see and patch. as for holes in the base there is some great underwater patch stuff you can get a a pool store, works for years! an added bonus of the dish soap is that if it gets into the pool it makes everything go to the sides and into the filter, it's the neatest trick. been doing that for regular maintanance for years, plus mosquitos can't lay eggs on water that has a soap film."
5,Don't expect them to last...,"We purchased an Easy Set Pool last June and were initially thrilled with it. However, after storing it in our dry basement for the winter, the inferior vinyl of the inflatable ring is full of holes. We purchased Easy Set's patch and went througn an entire roll with no luck. Every patch gave once the ring was re-inflated. We have now purchased a far superior glue/patch (Goop) and our pool is full of water and staying that way. Easy Set has only a very limited 90 day warranty. I would not purchase this pool if you hope to use it for more than one year. We're certainly not holding our breath for next year!"
5,Summer fun in a box........,"Easy setup, good instructions. Durable pool. Pump could use a little work, but overall a great value. Be aware that you will need to buy a ""test kit"" to ensure your water quality stays good and you will have to add chemicals accordingly."
2,It's good but.....,Hi. I bought this pool because my kids were insisting for it. At first it was a big liki mama but then afterwards it became a small faloooooooooooo mama........ i told my kids bane pilons boor sa dan zot face and they really liked it...
4,I loved the Pool,When my dad bought my sister and I this pool my dad had fixed everything.When It was ready and we got in it but then later my mom told us to get out but my sister and I didn't want to.I think that this pool is better than the other ones we had ever purchased.
1,"Horrible, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","Got this pool for our kids and grandkids. Very disappointed. FIrst off the pump did not work when we set up the pool. After several 1 hour or longer phone calls to Cust. Service we finally got a new pump 3 weeks after the pool was filled. Finally get to use the pool. But only for 6 weeks because now it is time to take it down. Taking it down, we find the entire bottom of the pool to be full of pin holes. Water is seeping out. Called Cust. Service. They will not stand by their product because we did not buy the extended warranty. We didn't even know one wa available. But I would think their product should last more than 6 weeks of use. SAVE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT BUY THIS POOL!"
2,Leaky liners!!,"Bought an EasySet 48""x15' pool last fall. Pool liner leaked at setup/fill. It took several weeks to get warranty info & approval for a replacement pool liner. Received replacement pool liner just before Thanksgiving, and as it was too cold to use pool, I waited until spring to setup/fill the replcement pool liner. GUESS WHAT? The replacement pool liner leaked twice as bad as the original pool liner. Further contact with INTEX about the second leaking pool liner, and their position is that ""it is beyond the 90 days from the original purchase date, therefore there is no longer a warranty!""JUST GREAT!! I have received two defective pool liners, and in my opinion INTEX has NOT followed the ""MAGNUSON-MOSS Federal Warranty Act"" retail warranty provisions.The pool concept is great, and I encountered no problems during setup (other then the leaky pool liners). I expect to get maybe two years use out of this defective pool kit, so it not all a waste. I just keep adding water to the pool!"
2,NOT A GOOD WAY TO START!,"After looking at a number of pools, we chose this one because of what appeared to be ease of set-up, enjoyment and durability. I read all of the reviews and started out mindful of the warning about level ground. I had no idea how TRUE that warning was. What appeared to be absolutely level too us, when filling the pool turned out to be unlevel. We are refilling now for the 3rd time. I wish I had gotten a steel wall or professional ground prep.This is so very disappointing to my family. I can agree with some of the reviewers, about tha ""15-30 minute ring set-up, and fill with water"".Whazzat????Never again! Hello professional pool builders!"
4,Giving up,"I have a pool like this that we bought last year. I think it is probably a fairly good pool if you take care of it. However, the levelness of the ground is a pain. We gave up last year. We also left it out all winter. I agree this was our fault. It is a pain to move and heavy if even a little water is in it. Anyway the top part got holes in it. I have been repairing and repairing to no end. I have been using liquid cement repair kits. Daily I fix it and blow it up. It has finally gone totally back down. All the water came out of it. I have given up. The kids love being in it. But at this point I don't think there is any hope in fixing it. I think this could happen to anyones pool at some point even if you don't leave it out all winter. A pet could poke holes in it."
3,help ! holes in top ring...,"does anyone have any suggestions as to find tiny holes in the top ring? i see a lot of you have had holes in the top ring of yours as well and could not find them only to have to reinflate the ring daily, i did find 2 tiny holes and i did this by taking the water hose and walking around the pool squirting water onto the ring and sqeezing it with the other hand, so one hands holding the hose and the other is squeezing the ring and as the water hit the ring i saw bubbles very clearly and found those holes, however it is still deflating and i cannot find another hole, i have looked and looked at least 5 times including getting on my knees and pushing the ring upwards (trying to look under the ring) and running water onto it at the same time, i cant find a thing, so anyone have any other ways i could look??email me at dvicki3@aol.com with any suggestions! thanks!"
2,This is awful,"This pool is ok but i would buy a metal pool. This pool is not very strong. I would tell you buyers to get a metal pool over this one! I have had this pool for a week and i hate it i would perfer a metal one which i am going to get soon. I have only been in it 3 times, Because we always have to clean it, But it's ok if you want to waste your money!"
1,Not Like the Picture on the Box!,"We purchased this Intex 15 X 42 pool and it's NOT what the box shows by any stretch of the imagination. We filled it up and it was supposed to have 3 feet of water, but barely had a foot and a half. After several struggles I found myself taking it back for store credit and going with a completely different pool. This was a waste of time, energy and resources. Don't bother!"
3,Disappointed!,"We bought this pool last year. We ended up filling it twice, as our ground was not perfectly level. Even after the second filling, it was not level enough to allow the sides to raise to their full height! Very important to buy chemicals to keep the water clean! This year when we got the pool out, there were 2 holes in the air-filled ring to patch and there is a water leak in the bottom! Again, it is not filling correctly. I am very disappointed in this supposedly easy pool!"
4,It's great for what it is,"As has been mentioned in other reviews, leveling the ground is of the utmost importance. We had a load of sand delivered, but just eyeballed it till it ""looked"" level. Not so much. After an hour of filling the pool, it was obvious that the whole thing would collapse if we were to keep going. So we drained her and spent another hour or so leveling the sand. Much better the second time around. It took over twelve hours to fill and a few days to warm up, but since then it's been a breeze. We add chlorine a couple times per week, skim it daily, run the pump (I do spray out the filter with the hose once a week) and that's it. It's short, so it's not real great for actual swimming, but for the price it's a great way to beat the heat."
1,"SWIMMING POOL DISASTER,AZ",I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN WE BOUGHT THE POOL.WE SET IT UP AFTER VIEWING THE VIDEO FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS TOOK HRS TO FILL.WE'VE HAD THE POOL FOR ONLY 2 WEEKS WHEN THE DAMN THING EXPLODED IN OUR BACKYARD ALL WE HEARD WAS AS IF WE WERE AT THE OCEAN.NOW OUR YARD LOOKS LIKE A TYPHOON HIT IT. ANYWAYS I DON'T RECOMMEND ANY ONE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT. WE WERE GETTING READY TO GO SWIMMING WHEN IT CAME APART I'M JUST GLAD NO ONE WAS IN THE POOL AT THE TIME.IF YOU WERE TO SEE MY YARD YOU'D UNDERSTAND.
3,Not very durable and a challenge to level,"I bought this particular pool in the summer of 2004. Well, I must say that it was the biggest challenge to level. It leaned on one side once it was filled up. If you are even 1 inch off, the pool will look lopsided. You MUST get at least 1 ton of sand in order to get it level. I put it up for the first time this spring and the top ring had a tiny pin hole in it. This caused the top ring to totally deflate and the pool collapsed causing my yard to flood. These pools are not durable at all. Before I bought this pool I had a 12' by 36"" pool and it had a leak around the seam, but I could not tell where it was coming from. These pools are not worth the hassle, time or money. I'm getting a metal frame pool this summer and I hope I have better luck. Also, I don't think these type of pools are safe for kids. When you hold on to the side, all of the water spills out causing a flood and possible injury to the child or anyone that holds on to it."
2,Leaking ring,"I came to this site today to check the prices on the swimming pools. We purchased the big one last summer for the $250.00 and the ring keeps leaking air and needs filling daily. I was just going to purchase a new pool this year because, I figured it was something we must have done to cause it although we are not rough in the pool and we used the ladder to get in and out. I am seeing now that others have had this problem as well and not long after purchasing it just like we experienced. Im beginning to wonder if its a quality product or not."
1,Pool buyer BEWARE,"I purchased this pool the end of May 2004 and it wasn't as easy to set up as they lead you to believe. But I did finally get it up and running. My family enjoyed it until the beginning of August when the seam that's attacted from the side to the bottom busted. 3,000 gallons of water everywhere. What a mess that was to clean up! Fortunately I was able to return it for a refund. Apparently the store had heard of this happening before. I think it must be a flaw in this type of pool. I'm sure there are alot out there that have been up and running with no problems for a long time. But I just wanted people to know that this could happen to you too."
2,not much of interest,"maybe if you were Canadian it would hold my interest but alas, there was not much there to enjoy, sorry"
2,Did not last too long,"Model SKCSC (candelabra base) - Used in a small kitchen lamp as a night light. Burned base up, for about 8 hours a night. Used a mechanical (not a digital or electronic) timer. Light was fine, and not harsh. But, the bulb lasted less than a year before it started to flicker and fail. Not a good value for the price. BTW, DOES contain Mercury, says so right on the box."
2,A disappointment,"If you're brand-new to guitar-playing, or have just discovered the blues, this book might be of some help. The CD tracks are clear and straightforward and the tablature is helpful. Many of the turnaround licks themselves, however, are either so elementary that no one of even mediocre skill will use them, or are of limited use because they're heavily jazz-influenced and unnecessarily complicated for guitarists not especially interested in jazz. I'm not a great guitar player, but I've been listening to blues music for decades, and of the 76 tracks on the CD, there's one -- ONE -- that I may try to learn and incorporate into my repertoire. Most of the turnarounds I've learned have come from regular, non-instructional music recordings, and they're not in this book."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this pool regardless of the price (which I thought was kind of high, not to mention the price of the air compressor I had to get to fill it) after reading all the online reviews. I couldn't wait to use it. Well after an hour of blowing it up with a compressor I could not believe how disappointed I was. First it took forever to inflate. Then the rainbow shade would keep falling over and it wasn't rounded like in the picture but more like a point. Then the dolphins wouldn't even stand up. I had to stand there and hold it. The slide would just flatten out whenever anyone used it. So needless to say I returned it. It had alot of great stuff and the colors were bright and pretty. Plus the depth is great for toddlers but I would not recommend it to anyone, nor will I ever buy a blow up pool again."
5,My kids love it!,"I bought this pool for my three kids last year. They love it. I took it with us when we went and visited my family in Colorado, it was a hit. My neices and nephew loved the dolphins and the two large ones holding the ball that sprayed the kids as they slid down the slide. My children are now 8, 4 and 2.5 yrs and they can't wait until I bring it out for summer fun."
5,We have named it Utopia,"This pool is just great. I purchased it for my nephew's twins who are only 1 and they have a wonderful time with the slide and enjoy the overall appearance with the rainbow, dolphins and all the accessories. No problem setting it up, just lots of chambers to fill, so they leave it blown up and store it when not in use."
1,This pool is a huge disappointment,"We live in Michigan and I ordered this pool for my daughter's birthday in April, only to find out in June, when I could no longer return it, that it doesn't set up correctly. The cheap plastic screw-in attachments used to secure the pool and allow the water to stay in, do not fit into one another, rendering it useless. My daughter was disappointed [...]"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,We didnt even get a full summer's use of this toy. It constantly leaked from different places and after it was patched in a dozon places we decided to get rid of it and get a new one. I was dissapointed b/c I thought it lookes really cute and liked that it had a little shady portion under the rainbow.My 1 year old son wans't that fond of it anyway and I don't think he will miss it.
4,mmmmmmmmm chocolate!,"This book is great for chocolate loving people. I have made several of the recipes which were simple and delicious, and won me praise by my friends and family. Some of the measurements are a little more difficult since I don't typically use ml, or grams to measure ingredients. Still, a great book to have when entertaining!"
4,"Great product, bad delivery","I ordered this belt with expedited delivery (because I really needed to vacuum my carpets)! They charged me over $10 for the delivery and yet it took almost 2 weeks to arrive. What a rip-off! If you order from this supplier don't pay extra for faster delivery, its a waste of money!"
1,broke after 1 try,"i changed the belt, not a fun thing. I used it.I lent it to my brother the next day (same apartment building) and the belt snapped.urgh"
4,It's a replacement for Hoover Style 2324.,"We have an old Hoover Elite2 upright and finding the correct belt wasn't easy. We purchased a 2-pack, from Freedom Vacs here on Amazon but they aren't carrying them anymore, about a year ago when the one that's been on the machine for over 15 years finally broke. That search led us to a Hoover replacement part Style No. 2324 for about 2 bucks but I couldn't find that one again. However, 40201190 is the same size though the price is now over 3 bucks for a 2-pack... so I bought two from Vac Belts. It took over 15 years to break the first belt and less than one year to break the replacement so I'm guessing they're not quite what they once were in quality... and we have even fewer carpets now. They get 5 stars because they fit but lose 1 star because it failed so quickly. I'm really rating the ones I purchased last year so perhaps these might be a bit better but only time will tell."
2,not impressed,"The belts the company sent were not the same serial number and were extremely tight, tighter than I think they should have been. The first belt lasted 15 minutes before it broke. The second belt is still working but I am not hopeful. Too bad this product did not, in any way, meet my expectations."
