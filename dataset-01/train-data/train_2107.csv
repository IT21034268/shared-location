5,Working great on 99 LX Civic,Easy as pie to install and is getting the job done. Only 3 screw to remove and the wiring plug. Had my blower working in under 5 min.
5,Good product that I didn't need,"1998 Honda Civic DX HatchThis was to be the third blower motor replacement for my car - turns out I didn't need to replace it - here's why:Old blower motor worked on only settings 3 and 4, not 1 or 2. I assumed the blower motor was at fault and when I replaced it with the new motor, it still worked on 3 and 4 only. I then did what I should have done before ordering the motor: google 'honda civic blower motor works on only 3 4' and find out it's the Blower Motor Resistor that needs replacing - also available on Amazon for a good price. Returned for refund and awaiting shipment of resistor (very easy install). DON'T MAKE THE SAME STUPID MISTAKE I DID..."
2,a bit boring and slow,"I ordered this book after it was recommended to me by a friend. After days of telling me how good it was, I decided to order it to see for myself. I usually am a pretty fast reader, but this book took weeks to finish. Not because it is long or because it has big words, which it is not, it's because it's boring! If you wanted to learn about mental illness, don't buy this book either, it teaches nothing of that. I then discussed this book with my friend and then I realized that he was a psychologist, which I forgot about. In a nutshell, do not buy this book as an ""I feel-like reading"" book because its not that interesting. Buy it only if you enjoy personal enlightenment stories,but if not, I would not recommend it."
5,Good stuff!,"Upon receiving the clamps I ordered, one refused to open. I looked them over, determined how they operated, stuck a flat screwdriver behind the clamping piece and the clamp opened, never to stick again. The clamps work first rate..."
4,Cabinet Master?,"When they open these are great clamps. Two concerns. They slam shut when you lift them from the opposite clamp end...be careful.Don't tightened them in the fully closed position... otherwise they become awkward croquet clubs. Treat them right and they'll treat you likewise. Great performance but useability weakness nets four star from me. I, would buy more!"
1,This product is worthless.,"The board is WAY too flimsy and lightweight; you end up chasing it across the counter because the ""non-skid"" feet slip all over the place. Additionally, the shipping costs are about twice what is stated, in terms of weight category. I ended up paying $20.25 for an inadequate $6.80 purchase."
3,Effective Arguements but lost my favor in the end,"The author makes an excellent arguement about the bible being the book of an angry and vengeful as well as cruel being , known as YHWH. He poses questions about Israelites ravishing whole entire nations for not worshiping Jehovah (YHWH). He also points out the problem with sacrifcing animals and humans for someone else's ""sins"". Shouldn't we all be accountable for our own errors?I really felt I could identify with the author until midway through he poses the thought of there being a ""master race"" of people. That's when he lost me. In all of his attempts to debunk the bible due to cruelty and racism, the author himself turns into the very thing he tries to debunk. That's my opinion of it. Was a bit disappointed, but overall I'm still glad I purchased the book."
2,More research to do,"It would be great if this author were also to write books about The Talmud, The Zohar and the Koran. Would he use the same title?Maybe he can also write a book about atheism, including Stalin and Mao (together good for 100 million deaths), would he use the same title?"
5,Baton,"The product was a bit more expensive, but in good shape, shipped quickly. The description matched, which is always good haha"
3,Too small for soup or cereal,"We bought these bowls as part of a large purchase of Villeroy & Boch Switch 3 dishware, and these were the only pieces that we weren't perfectly happy with. Unless you're very light eaters, these bowls will be much too small for either soup or cereal. We then bought the Villeroy & Boch Switch 3 rice bowls and are now using those for cereal, and use these as small dessert bowls."
3,This is not a soup/ceral bowl,This is more of a desert bowl. It is too small for an average bowl of soup or cereal. I believe that it is not correctly labeled as the soup/cereal bowls at Macy's were larger and with rounded edges (as a soup bowl should be). You will be diappointed if you are looking for a funcional soup bowl.
3,Weird shape,The bowls are a little small but not that bad really. I'm more disappointed with the shape (flat bottom and straight sides). These also stack poorly. Rounded sides would have been much better and I'm going to order the rice bowl to replace these.
4,Easy to work with; would buy again,"Areas used on: Eyebrow, underarm, leg, bikiniType of hair/skin: Coarse/not sensitivePros: Easy to work with, less sticky than Gigi Honee Wax, cleans up easier, no drip, not as harsh on skinCons: Did not pick up short hairs from eyebrows and underarms. Had to tweeze remaining hairs.I have yet to find a perfect wax so, in the meantime, I will buy this for its easy clean up and mild formula."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"This is by far the WORST wax I have ever used. This wax removes skin....not hair, is painful and does not come off clean. It leaves a disgusting sticky residue that is easily cleaned but disgusting nonetheless. Will not EVER purchase this crap again! Waste of money."
2,Disappointing,"Usually when an artist has fallen off the radar, he returns to his roots and releases a back-to-basics raw album. This couldn't be further from the case for Bad Azz. An underground album with commercial content. You'll find Gangsta-lite braggadocio here and a whole bunch of dance tracks.The production is amateur and simple. Average preset keyboard drums and simple 4-bar loops. Very disappointing album. Even the obligatory diss song is weak. Why would you ever admit to getting your ass beat on a diss song?""If you was really callin shots round here/The homie Bad would never gotten jumped on round here""???It's not terrible, but it's a terribly disappointing effort. Especially after a great album like Personal Business."
2,Mac User BEWARE!!!!,"First of all let me say that if you're a PC user, read all the other reviews of this unit. It really is a nice unit with all the features described. The reason I'm giving it two stars is because of what I feel is Canon's intentional misleading of the public when they claim that this is Mac compatible. From the box to the manual to the website, Canon uses the Mac logo to communicate that this unit is Mac compatible. This is only PARTIALLY true. This unit works ONLY as a printer and fax with the Macs - NOT A SCANNER. No where is this ever communicated. Even the printed manual and the Advanced Manual that is provided as a PDF on an included CD make any mention of the fact that you can not use this as a scanner on a Mac. Furthermore, Canon has no plans on ever making a driver so that you can do scans on a Mac. It's not bad that the unit can't do Mac scanning but I'd rather know about that BEFORE I purchase it and set it up at home."
4,Pretty good AIO printer with a few quirks,"This printer is pretty good general AIO. There are a few quirks that I encountered during my use that are probably specific to my printer/myself. The scanner is moderate resolution, so photos tended have some banding. Adequate for computer use, but not great for re-printing. The device has VERY limited capability for heavier than normal paper, and there is minimal/no option for custom paper sizes or envelopes. Because of its size, the cartridges are smaller and you will need to replace them more frequently than a normal size printer. I was never able to get the email feature to work, as I suspect I didn't have a server. As for networking, once connected to a wireless router and the drivers installed on each wireless computer, everything worked well. I had to power cycle the printer once a month, probably due to my router. But, in the end, I would buy this printer again, if I needed everything in a small package."
3,Not as advertised,"My only problem is that Canon gave me wrong information, and it seems to be industry wide, and that is to confuse ""duplex scanning"" with ""duplex printing"". I bought this printer on the Canon reps description of the product that it does ""duplex scanning"" meaning to scan both sides of one document at the same time. When it arrived and I found out that it did not, I called Canon support again, and inquired as a new customer would, about machines that did ""duplex scanning"". I was told by a sales rep that ""all of our image class printers do duplex scanning"" which is totally incorrect as none of their Image Class printers have this feature. Otherwise it probably is a good printer. ;+)"
1,When it's working it's great,"Ok, first off, let's just admit straight upfront, we're using apple computers and an apple network, so at least part of my frustrations can be brushed off because of that. However, we've had this about a month and a half and it's been actually functioning about 1/2 the time. I've spent several weeks going back and forth with tech support. It was kind of a pain to setup initially, but once we got it hooked up with an IP address, it was working (at least printing), but then a power outage appeared to cause it to have stopped communicating again. I'm still going back and forth with Canon support (so far they've suggested all the obvious again)."
2,"Windows Yes, Mac No","This is probably nearing the end of its product cycle. It is a fantastic Windows networked printer (wired), but even with the 1.8 version OSX drivers (that you download, no MAC drivers or documentation is enclosed), I cannot get it to print networked as a standalone printer. It is possible, however, to print over the network if it is ""shared"" by a windows computer. Scanning is to USB. It will work with a MAC if connected by USB, and it works very well."
5,Great product,"I work in a law office and think this is a great product for scanning, copying, and printing documents right at my desk. The only thing that could possibly make it any greater would to be able to print in color. Thankfully, however, I can scan color photos and documents. I am very pleased thus far!"
2,Great machine. When working.,"I was very satisfied with it. Starts printing fast. Double-sided printing. Setting up on the network was easy and worked the first try. Great quality copying. Not as bulky as other brands/models.But after 2 months and a half of use and less than 1000 prints:- toner life is short- it broke. Seems to be the power supply. Took it to a local Canon service facility and it has been there for 2 weeks. They are not able to tell when it will be ready. They say Canon hasn't shipped them the needed part yet and there is no estimate of when the part will be shipped.So my rate is affected by the low reliability I experienced, slow warranty service and high cost of ownership based on the toner's life."
2,Be warned,"The product wasn't the version (shape) that was described. I didn't find the particular version a problem, I simply had to purchase alternate accessories, which was a Christmas morning bummer. The main problem was that a channel was blown (only one side was producing music.) I'm still in the process of returning it so I cannot comment on the return process.Be warned - your refurbished ipod may not be all you expect."
5,Great Book On little known special group.,"I usually don't write reviews on books as I read so many but this one was so good I needed to. I was not aware of this unit of the US. Navy until I read this book. It's outstanding. The author writes with a dash of humor along with great detail what it's like to be in combat under great stress to help out others in grave danger. The comradeship and love of his fellow companions. I have a collection of approx. 350 non-fiction war books and have read many more that I did not keep. I rate this one at the top for enjoyment and knowledge of a little known group. Dan, Thanks for a great book. I'm going to get the other as soon as possible. edwards190@sbcglobal.net"
2,Warriors at work .... but some writing needed,"A story about a group of warriors in Vietnam - doing a job that most of us can barely fathom. I did not realize the HAL-3 (Seawolves) Squadron had such action during the Tet Offensive. Mr. Kelly does a decent job of chronicling some of the Seawolves' missions - but his writing lacks the finesse and skill that would have brought this book to another level. It was too much like Rambo using a typewriter. There is more to describing people than using the nicknames and telling us their favorite weapons.""Chickenhawk"" is a much better helicopter chronicle of the Vietnam War, although it doe not involve the Seawolves or the US Navy."
2,HAL-3 reader,"Someone commented on Mr. Kelly's other Seawolves book, ""First Choice"", that it sounded like Navy propaganda. That's what I thought about this one. He really dumps on Army pilots in this book. And there's too much about the SEALs and not enough about the aircrew. It reads like fiction - I kept looking at the spine of the book to make sure that it was indeed a non-fiction book. I won't be buying ""First Choice""."
2,"Ok, not great","This is not Toni's Price's best. There are a few cuts that fit the title, Born to be Blue, while most of the CD sounds like Ms Price can't decide if she's Rock n Roll or Country."
3,Honey oak folding bookcase with optional mantle top,"Purchased two of these shelves with the optional mantle tops. The most difficult step in the assembly was breaking down the shipping boxes. Sides just fold out and shelves flop down. That's it. Other reviews are correct about the little holes not lining up properly. Kind of a struggle... tap one side down with rubber mallet, opposite side pops up. Once in place, these shelves seem a little flimsy and could probably use an additional support to stabilize it but we are just using them under a window, next to a desk to hold a printer and all the little gadgets that go along with your computer set-up. The most difficult part of the actual placing of these shelves was dealing with the computer's spaghetti mess. Bottom line: Shelves seem a little rickety but look just like the picture. If I had to purchase these again, I might have chosen something else."
4,"Bookcases are great, mantel tops less so...","I ordered two of these narrow folding bookcases, one wide one, and mantel tops for all three to complement my white kitchen cabinetry and make my cookbook and vintage Pyrex storage/display uniform, instead of the hodgepodge of shelves I'd made do with for years. The shelves and tops are all solid wood, crisply painted, and the shelves are idiot-proof when it comes to assembly: 1. Stand it upright. 2. Unfold it. That said, though they're from the same Home Decorators manufacturer, the little pre-drilled holes on the mantel tops don't align perfectly with the pegs on the bookcases; the wide one was fine, but the narrow ones were askew and I had to bow the bookcase frames outward slightly to get the top to fit on all four pegs.Once I lined up the shelves together, only an obsessive would notice the discrepancy. A more determined person than I could also drill out the holes a bit to better align them...but I'm lazy, and for my purposes these worked out fine."
2,Wobbly - Defects,"First - the color. I agree it is a bit dark for Honey Oak, but not at all Cherry as some other reviewers have indicated.Second - the quality. I'm disappointed. There are dark defects in the wood and the shelves are wobbly. The only thing I can adjust are the braces in the back (with a hex wrench)so the shelves will have to remain a bit loose. There are also ""mistake"" holes near the hinge where clearly it was drilled wrong. Product like this should not be shipped. QC !!Third - the little connectors on top. I don't intend to stack mine and it has those little connectors sticking out of the top. They are dark and obvious. So far I have not been able to remove them.I have a very similar bookcase I bought several years ago that is constructed much better than this. Apparently it's true - they just don't make things the way they used to."
3,Worked great until the motor blew,The Eureka Boss worked great until the motor blew in it about a year and a half after buying it. It was a bit heavy but had great suction.
2,doesn't last long,"I am on my second 4870J smart boss. It starts out great, then things start going wrong. The first one I had the brush roll would not turn off. It's not good to be using the hose with the brush roll still running. So I took that one back. The second one I got it started out good, good suction quiet, but after about 2 weeks it got really loud, sounds like a loud lawn mower, I read the manual and tried everything to fix it and it didn't help. It has good suction but it doesn't last, if you buy one, keep your receipt."
2,Waste of money,"This vacuum cleaner is a piece of junk. I totally agree with a previous reviewer - It starts out good enough, but after you use it a few times, it just starts falling apart. After using it maybe 3 or 4 times, the roll brush quits moving - we replaced the belt, it was okay for maybe one more quick vacuum then it quits moving again. The ONLY reason I even gave it two stars was because I do like the attachments - which is what I am having to vacuum my whole house with right now since the brush won't roll anymore. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! I'm buying the Kenmore Progressive Upright this weekend - it has rave reviews!"
3,Just OK.,"I had worn out a fabulous Porter-Cable 14.4v cordless drill. I had used and abused it, great batteries, great power. My family got me this 19.2v model as a replacement. It works well, lots of power, etc... but the battery life is very poor, a fraction of my previous tool. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Junk,"I owned the drill for about a week when one of the batteries smoked and sizzled while in the case. I have yet to find out if the liquid that sprayed from the battery is toxic and what I do with it now, since Amazon, TrueValue and Porter Cable want to pass the buck and tell me to contact someone else. I will never buy Porter Cable again."
4,drills ok,The drill is ok. Not as tough as I had hoped since a drop to the floor from waist level broke a piece of plastic on it. Good buy for the money but wish it was built like a hitachi.
3,Porter Cable disappointment,"I bought this drill/driver because I already have a Porter Cable 19.2 Volt hammer drill. Getting two more matching batteries and a needed tool seemed like a good idea. But when I received the new drill, I discovered that it has smaller batteries with a shorter life. Both tools are 19.2 volt, but the drill/driver batteries have 1/4 to 1/3 less life. Very disappointed, and feel their should have been some disclosure."
5,Old Mother West Wind and 6 Other Stories : The Adventures of,Any of Thorton W. Burgess's books are great reading for children. The stories are simple enough for children to relate to and will stimulate their imaginations as well as their appetite for books that are fun to read.The downside of these books is that your children are probably going to want to read as many in the series as possible. Fortunately the prices at Amazon are reasonable and if you need to save some money you can take your children to the library where they will quickly memorize the location of books by Thorton W. Burgess.
3,Gentle Lessons from Nature,"Gentle Lessons in NaturePublished in 1910 these 16 short animal tales were written for the author's son. A dedicated conservationist from Cape Cod Burgess introduces young children to a rogues' gallery of critters, who learn lessons the hard way. Mother West Wind brings her own children, the merry little breezes, down to play each morning; what they watch the various critters do and say provides human children with simple, sometimes humorous advice on moral behavior without being preachy. Hopefully future generations will appreciate and respect Nature the sooner for having been introduced to these amusing woodland characters with their all-too-human foibles. The choice of illustrator makes these tales come alive, for they stimulate a childlike imagination in an age when too much is pre-programmed for kids. I also recommend a sweet little book of animal stories called Hedgerow Tales by Enid Blyton."
4,very suitable for young readers,"Basically, I enjoyed the book a lot. The story is simple, but inspiring. The sentences repeats itself a lot, but as an adult, I still found it interesting. I think not only this book, but the whole series of this authur is a great for kids to read. The pictures in it is also kinda fun."
2,Disappointed,"Having read numerous Mexican cookbooks and numerous ""forDummies"" books, I expected more.Specifically:o An emphasison the basics: kitchen equipment, herbs and spices, preparation methods, cooking techniques. And with adaquate illustrations;o Some semblence of recipe organization. Recipes seem like a hodge-podge collection, with a less-than-effective 'theme/chapter' organization. END"
4,"Cooking in Los Angeles, CA","Not a Dummie anymore! I love this style of book; it is simple, informative & concise. Especially helpful to the novice cook!"
2,Poorly organized and lack of useful images,"This book has a good written introductory chapter though fails beyond that. Here are three examples of the failings:1. Salsa is constantly referred to in various recipes though the book does not have a salsa recipe.2. There is no index to speak of. I could not lookup what page a salsa recipe was on, so rather flipped through the book twice not finding one.3. Various Mexican vegetables are described which will not be familiar to the layperson which was good, though pictures of the vegetables were not included. It is great to know that I need jicama, chayote, and serrano peppers, though it is a bit hard to go and buy them if I am only going by a verbal description.My recommendation is do not buy this book. Some decent points, though in sum total, the book is just frustrating and you would be better off with something else."
3,Mexican cook book,"It is a bit hard to evaluate the book. I did not learn a lot from it, but I did gain some insights. It was well worth the price. The reason I did not learn much is because I already know quite a lot about Mexican food. For the novice, this book would be a 5 star acquasition. :) I am very glad to add it to my library."
3,Just a Lil disappointed,I LOVE SPONGEBOB CARTOONS!! I was just a little upset when I got my Patrick and he only said one phrase. Its still cool though cause it's a spongebob toy.
5,Great carseat!,"This is a great carseat and carrier. We replaced the Evenflo Titan, because of the difficulty in getting the straps to tighten enough and to tighten evenly on the left and right shoulders. The Graco carseat is a snap to install, and it is very easy to get the baby strapped in (not as many tears). It's also very easy to attach and release the carseat from the base. The sunshade is very handy to block the afternoon sun shining through the back window."
1,What Bluegrass??,"If you are really looking for bluegrass music, the title of this DVD will completly mislead you. Not much real bluegrass and what they did have was not that well performed. Played once and now it just sits."
4,Fantasy beyond sword and sorcery,"""Implements of Destruction"" is lively fantasy full of swords, sorcery, daemons, and thieves, yet it goes far beyond any standard sword & sorcery setting. The characters are a fascinating collection, each a distinctive personality with a wonderful conglomeration of strengths and weaknesses. No pure black & white views of good and evil characters here, no stock villians or good guys--the villians are as rich and complex as the good guys, who also have their own little touches of darkness to deal with.The world is richly developed with little oddities--like exploding Rubik's cubes--threaded throughout that left me wanting to know more, to explore more.The writing is fast and clear. I really enjoyed the touches of sarcastic and wry humor. I snickered more than once at some of the characters' thoughts and comments.All in all, a very solid, worth-while fantasy novel. I hope we'll see more of this world and--especially--these characters."
3,how to take contact with the author?,since I'm a SF (italian) writer and share the same name it seems obvious I want to take contact with Micheal.
1,HORRIBLE,"Photo is great - but this bottle we recieved has turned (old??) and the smell is very off. Have ordered this from amazon years ago, and was fine, but this last bottle we ordered was horrible."
5,Excellent Cologne,"I have been looking for this productfor a long time,girls compliment meon this cologne often. Found it onAmazon!"
1,Lagerfeld Photo and classic,Used Lagerfeld many years ago and loved it. Now it seems like somethingis missing in both and Photo and the Clasic. The scent's disappear rapidlyand are certainly not long lasting. There are other colognes by other makersthat are far superior. Will not buy again.
5,The Smell of Sucess,"This fragrance will satisfy the most finicky of olefactory glands. Not sweet or fruity like most colognes, the scent is musky with a hint of the Far East, deep and mysterious."
4,Take my PHOTO,I received this as a gift from my wife. I have always used like Lagerfeld products. Thumbs up. Thanks
5,Lagerfeld Photo,I have used Lagerfeld Photo for years and love it. I was extremely happy to find it still available. Service from this supplier was quick and the product arrived in good condition. I couldn't have asked for better! I will happily purchase from them again in the future.
5,Light and Crisp...at a great price.,Excellent cologne. Very light fragrance that is perfect for day or evening. Very versatile. This is also an amazing price.
4,Recording and Production Techniques,The book gives you everything: from how to plan a sassion and arranging all the way to mastering. Full of usefull tips and techinques to get the job done. Setting up mics for acoustic guitar and using the right effect on vocals is easy after reading this book.
4,Slick Idiot - the aural salad,"Overall, I think that this disc has a very good variety of sounds on here, and that some extremely creative takes on SI songs were done. There are several dancey remixes, a ""cover"", more or less, of I Feel Fine done folksy/Bob Dillon Style, mixes that were experimental in the realm of being Skinny Puppy-esque, and some that were a great amalgamation of several genres in one song. My favorites among them were En Esch's remix of Lazy, Track 2 - the second It Won't Do Remix, and Hanzel and Gretyl's version of Idiot. While I do wish that someone would have done remixes of Make Me Believe, the video for the song was on this disc and kinda made up for that particular remix void. The vid was very cool and well done with some neat effects and even some cute outakes during the credits. the remixers on here did a good job of rewiring the original songs to make them their own creation. Definitely worth checking out. :)"
4,Fascinating contemporaneous look at Hitler's Germany before US entered war,"I read this after reading ""In the Garden of the Beasts"". It was fascinating reading Martha Dodd's perspective at that time, when we now know how things turned out - both on the world scale, and in her own life. She pulls very few punches in this book. Interesting also to see her presentation of the merits of communism, and get a glimpse of why that was both appealing to some and feared by others, in the context of the day. Definitely worth finding a copy for a read if you've read ""In the Garden of the Beasts."""
4,Cute,"My husband loved having this on his phone. He is a Boston sports fan all the way. However, the decal came off quicker than expected. But it was nice while it lasted!"
4,Super sharp,"These baby's are super sharp when new. They make life so much easier when planning. They do not like nails, but no blade would."
1,"This is a review of Amazon, not this item","I ordered this item from Amazon. It took Amazon 4 days to ""say"" they had shipped. It took another 4 days for the item to reach a USPS postal service in the same city (Atlanta). Amazon of course claimed shipment prior to shipment which appears to have become their custom with my orders.By the way, I would give the planer knives 3 stars. The 1 star rating is for Amazon."
1,Knives made of butter?,"I'm beginning to think the knives are made of butter. Initially they cut great. Glassy smooth, mirror finish, etc. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to last very long. With my very first set of knives I was planing some 13"" Maple. The most I could take off without the machine almost stopping was 1/128"". That's a far cry from the 1/16"" bragged about on their website. It only took a couple of passes before the knives turned to garbage. I'm now on my second set of knives. I planed 40 board feet of Cherry for a project and they're already dull with a large nick in the blade (perceivably from a tiny knot in one of the boards). I already have to turn them over now. At this rate it's costing me $20 every project just to plane my stock. The knives cut softwoods great. They cut hardwoods great for a few boards. Then you might as well be using your belt sander. I'm definitely going to upgrade to a different planer if these are the only knives available."
2,knives 13 inch,"THESE BLADES CHIP VERY EASILY. I PLANED A 2 BY 4 BOARD AND THE BLADES GOT TWO SMALL CHIPS ON THEM.I FED THE 2 BY 4 EASY AND TOOK OFF A VERY LITTLE AT A TIME. PLEASE REPLY, THANKS PAT STEBBINS."
3,After 20 hours use drive belt broke & damaged housing.,"The planer does excellant job, but one side of blade lasted about 7 hours of planing white oak. Main drive belt shredded and damaged its housing. Have to return to service center for warranty replacement. Based on previous experience with delta/porter cable service center can expect machine to be out of service for a month. Replacing this part is not discussed in owner's manual. Manual does not provide blow up of parts or identify parts by part nos."
2,Python 25 ft.,Owned this item in the past.Construction seems to have gone downhill since then.Threads on the switch (both ends) are very sloppy.
3,They still have it,"My favorite song on this cd is Still Here. the others are ok, but not as touching to me."
1,A big disappointment,"I have plenty of Porter Cbale tools that I just love, this unfortunately is not one of them. It just didn't do the job. It took a lot of pushing and man handling to get it to cut at all. It seemed to me the jaws just weren't designed with enough travel.I bought an electric shear after this which cut right through."
5,Excellent recipes!,"The recipes are fast, easy, and taste great! My husband's favorite is probably the Curried Chicken Salad with Mango - it's a miracle that I can get him to eat a salad for dinner. Now my mom wants it for Christmas."
1,Do Not Buy This Radio,"I purchased a remanufactured Eton E10. My first problem that I had was that the radio batteries or recharging system did not fuction. There was no way to recharge the batteries.I sent the radio back to Amazon and asked for a replacement only to have the knobs fall off as soon as the 2nd radio was taken out of the box. The moral of this review is, ""You get what you pay for."" 2nd radio is also beig sent back to Amazon. Save you self time and buy the Sony 7600GR."
3,The way things were,"Revivals were at the heart of 19th Century Presbyterian life. Now, after fifty years in ministry, I must confess I have never attended, sponsored or heard of a Presbyterian revival. So, what has changed? Rev. Sprague was pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church in Albany, an Old School congregation which he served for forty years pior to the Civil War. He battled the forces of Charles Finney over the nature and practice of revivals and this book is his argument for decent and orderly revivals free of the overt emotionalism characteristic of Finney and his New School followers. A good introduction to the conservative revival tradition - but you have to ask yourself why did it die out. Were the good Presbyterians of Albany today asked whether they favored revivals they would look at you and wonder...what few of them remain."
4,Boring yet Interesting!,"After taking half the book for what might be the most boring WW2 autobiography in print, we get an excellent look at Japanese cryptosystems and how they were attacked. If you're interested in crypto-stuff you'll love this book. If not, keep looking."
4,Fine Narrative,The author was a cryptographer working out of Australia during WWW II. This is his personal narrative and an operational history combined. Not definitive because at the time of writing much documentation remained to be declassified. A worthwhile addition to a SIGINT collection.
4,Not Bad At All,"This is actually a pretty good effort by Fey. She did get nominated for the best Pop Vacal Album for a latin Grammy this year. The cd actually is pretty true to the original recording by Mecano. There is not too much change but still I feel that it is a good cd. The only songs that are ""dancy"" are Me Cole En Una Fiesta and Ay Que Pesado. These two tracks are probably the most ""Fey"" songs. As we all know she is not a teenager any more and she has to grow up so we see a more mature side of her. But the little electronic changes and her raspy voice add a twist to the songs that are pleasent. If you LOVE Mecano you might be a little bias towards this album since Ana Torroja has a higher pitched voice than Fey. Overall give it a chance, it is a good cd."
2,I want Fey back,"It's very disapponting that two years after her masterpiece ""Vertigo"", Fey comes back with an album that has NO original material. The 12 songs that come here are all covers of the spanish band Mecano. I understand she feels inspired by them or whatever, but she should stay doing what she is great at: original techno music. It would have been ok if this CD had one or two covers, but a full album filled with old songs is just disapponting. I hope she edits a brand new album soon, or she will loose a fan."
3,BETTER THAN I THOUGH,"I must confess i'm a fey's bigest fan...But this time, she put it everything in risk just to do a decent ""Remake"" of Mecano.When i knew she was going to do this cd, i though ""NOO"" but: She has prove still can make a decent record.""La Fuerza del Destino"" is the best song, and ""Barco a Venus"" ""Hoy No me puedo Levantar"" and ""Los Amantes"", the rest is just good. Anyway still worth to buy it. Go ahead."
1,why are these two grouped together,"The snowman is such a lovely piece, why would you group it together with Fr. Christmas? There should be an option to buy the snowman on DVD by itself or paired with the book."
3,Not the original,"If you are after the original gist of Raymond Briggs' Father Christmas, you won't find it here (regardless that Amazon incorrectly mentions Mel Smith in the credits)Changing a version to suit cultural differences (replacing the odd word or phrase) is one thing, but unfortunately with this, Briggs' central character has lost his identity.'The Snowman' seems to have escaped this butchery and the dvd is cheap, so it gets a few stars!"
1,Beautiful story...broken DVD,"I have purchased this DVD twice and have tried to play them on our regular DVD player as well as on two laptops. No matter what I've tried, The Snowman has never played. Only the very different and very awful Father Christmas will work. I finally gave up and bought the VHS tape of The Snowman, so that my children could see the most wonderful and haunting Christmas movie ever made."
1,Sanitized American version,"First, the DVD is defective. Only the Father Christmas story plays. This version is a sanitized American version which eliminates the British Engllish expressions that give life to the story. SKIP THIS DVD! If you ever have a chance to see a British PAL video, you'll see why."
2,Father Christmas,"I saw ""Father Christmas"" for the first time several years ago on PBS and thought it was adorable. However, I was extremely disappointed with what I received when I recently purchased the DVD. Instead of hearing Mel Smith as the voice of Father Christmas comically singing ""Happy bloomin Christmas"" we got an americanized version with a different actor and different dialogue altogether. Too bad they felt it necessary to ruin a perfectly lovely animated film."
2,WARNING: Not the Bob Hoskins Version,"I was very disappointed with the version of ""Father Christmas"" on this DVD. For some inexplicable reason, someone chose to re-record the voices, replacing Bob Hoskins with William Dennis Hunt. To make matters worse, they also chose to Americanize and sanitize it, replacing ""chips"" with ""fries"" and changing the song ""Another Bloomin' Christmas"" to ""Another Merry Christmas"". I'm glad I have the original version on VHS."
5,Magical!,"Wow! What a wonderful addition to our DVD collection! Being the parent of a 2 year old, I am very selective in what I allow my daughter to watch. Both these stories are delightful but I particularly appreciated the simplicity of the Snowman because of it's absence of dialogue and beautiful music. It encouraged my daughter to tell me what the story was rather than the average video which leaves little to the imagination. A definite must-have for year round viewing!"
4,David Bowie Version?,"I love ""The Snowman"". However, this is the second version I have purchased in hopes to find the version introduced by David Bowie. Even though Amazon lists this version, and a version I bought last year, as the David Bowie version, it is not. Why does this keep happening? Does the David Bowie version even exist on DVD?David Bowie aside, this is still a great movie. I just wish Amazon would correct their product descriptions to avoid future disappointment."
2,Virginia viewer,I have not even seen this DVD but am VERY familiar withboth animations. THE SNOWMAN IS WONDERFUL......Hands down.If what they say about FATHER CHRISTMAS is true then it hastruly been RUINED. And I can not imagine how that was allowedto happen or what idiot thought it up. Sometimes there is areason to still have firing squads.
3,"Nice flick, but no Mel Smith","This is a nice version of the book, but BEWARE, the actor Mel Smith does not do the voice of Father Christmas. The original version had Mel Smith, but this DVD doesn't. The voice actor is William Dennis-Hunt, he's in the credits at the end of the movie and he's not British. I contacted Amazon to make this change but they didn't."
2,WARNING: Not the Mel Smith Version,"For some inexplicable reason, this version of ""Father Christmas"" has William Dennis Hunt as the voice of Father Christmas instead of Mel Smith. In addition, the dialog has been Americanized (e.g. ""chips"" replaced with ""fries"") and the lyrics ""another bloomin' Christmas"" have been changed to ""another merry Christmas"". I'm glad I have the Mel Smith version on VHS."
3,Snowman Wonderful Father Christmas Abomination,"If you read the reviews here they are all pretty much unanimous. The Snowman is such a wonderful animated classic. Everything about it is a pure joy from animation to the music to the story. If you have been replacing your videos with DVDs, then it's worth the price to own the Snowman on DVD.But Father Christmas is a pure abomination. Whose big idea was it to edit it and rerecord Santa's dialogue? They should be taken out into a winter storm and left there. More to the point, who was the wise guy who decided to include this version of it on the DVD rather than the Mel Smith original??? Needless to say, I was very very disappointed when I first watched it. If you can find a VHS copy of the original with Mel Smith, buy two copies of it. So when the first one wears out, you'll have a spare, just in case they've not released it on DVD by that time."
2,Under powered,"Works well ,but not as powerful as claimed, I have an old cheapie from harbor freight with 250 lbs of torque, this porter cable is no more powerful than it is."
4,Good general information,This is an okay book on whitetail hunting. The author is straight forward. Miller does not sugarcoat the fact that consistently bagging mature bucks in big woods requires dedication and hard work. The information in the book is general and some specific examples would have improved the book. This book will give you a good general idea of how to approach hunting forests.
4,good ol greg miller,"Not as packed as his other books but good any way. This guy is a stud who really knows what the F*** is goin on in the woods. Try it, it will increase your knowledge and maybe youll bring home a wall hanger. Greg miller is all about devotion, if you dont have the heart to hunt 365 this wont work for you."
2,Fishnet Blackhose,"The quality and fitting of the pantyhose was fine, however, while wearing them for the first time, my 2 big toes came through the holes creating an uncomfortable evening, (I do not have long toe nails) my toe nails are very short and soft. The pantyhose cannot be worn again. It would have been a better product of the hose had reinforced toes."
3,Just needed to complete my ps2 game collection,"This game is kinda fun for the price. I only paid $8 that's with shipping. If you like racing and you just want it in a different form, then you'll like this game. It's easy and simple. you just race. Would not pay more than $10 though."
1,[Didn't Like It!],"Oh, yeah, I love playing a game racing people with wheels glued to their hands. I completely dislike this game and think that It could only truthfully deserve -50 stars, but for some weird reason, you don't have that setting. The graphics look like a 1 year old drew them and that same kid came up with the idea of people with wheels for hands. Oh Im gunna beat you wheel man! ..."
5,Fun toy,This is part of set and my grandson enjoys it. Such joy to know they are safe toys and visually stimulating.
4,Nice discman!,"I was overall pleased with the discman! I haven't really used it much. I like it because of its sportyness. But, I really don't listed too much to cds anymore. It does everything it says it will do."
2,"I Will Try Once, But Not Twice","I received an Ott-Lite for Christmas 2002, and (due to household construction) was not able to use it until September 2003. The bulb burned out after about three days of intermittent use. I will order a new one from Amazon.com, and if it burns out quickly -- as others (below) indicate they do, then I will certainly tell you about it.And here's a good question, looking at the ordering screen: Can you imagine anyone crazy enough to order a USED light bulb ?"
1,Run Away from Ott Lamp,"I bought an Ott lamp for $120.00. It worked for 6 months light usage then the ballast burned out. Thank God it didn't cause a fire. When I unplugged it, it was extremely hot and making hissing and crackling noises. I emailed Ott Lamp's customer service about getting a replacement ballast but they never even bothered to email me back. These Lamps cost to much to for so much junk both in product and service. I am looking for a competitors lamp now instead. I know others make daylight lamps."
1,Ott Lite - Junk Lite,I bought two floor stand Ott Lites - Both have failed after short usage - Ballast failure - Cannot find replacement
1,OTT-LITE 18W floor model,I also bought a OTT-LITE 18W lamp. The bulb went out withing 8 hours of use. Another reviewer said the support people said the bulb was installed wrong. Mine came installed. (wrong from the factory?) I see no registration mark on the bulb or lamp which leads me to feel the OTT-LITE staff is inept. Does anyone know if this problem has been solved?
1,"Once bitten, twice stung...","...now we have invested [alot of money] in this procduct...a second bulb burned out within 10 hours of installation and use. A call to Customer Service indicates improper installation is the problem. If it takes a Rocket Scientist or Neuro Surgeon to install the bulb, then just say so. We are going to try a third time...if that proves futile, I will relish a campaign disclosing the overpriced poor quality of this product."
1,Bad Ballast,"We have a floor stand Ott lamp. One day it did not work at all. Bought a new bulb, plugged it in and no light! Tested the two outer most pins of the 4 pin receptacle and found no power. Measured the resistance between these two pins and found them open. This means the ballast is bad, not the bulb. The ballast is the large black object that you plug into your electrical outlet. It's a ballast, not a transformer. Ott Lite is selling defective floor lamps."
1,twice burned!,"I never take the time to write a review. I bought a OTT-lamp and it stopped working after the first bulb burned out. After getting the lamp replaced by the Ott light company, the same thing happened again. Hard to believe it could happen twice. I couldn't believe me eyes when I read other people were having the same exact problem.What a waste of money!"
1,Low illumination and overpriced,The Ott-Lite 18 watts floor lamp is not good. 18 watts yields hardly enough light. The product is overpriced. Hard to use because the lamp must be adjusted to its lowest position down close to the page.
5,Ott Lite,"I have been using Ott Lite for over 5 years. It greatly reduces eye strain. I read the newspaper, magazines, and other technical journals and novels with Ott Lite. It is a great product!! The replacement tube is the first one I have had to buy. It fit without any modifications. The seller offered it at a tremendous discount."
1,Shameful Lump in the Landfill Now,"Before you buy this bulb, make sure that it's a bulb you really need, and not a ballast (although I'm not sure how you go about telling the difference--the light just goes out one day--perhaps an electrician would know how to tell which one you need?). I'm now stuck with two of these bulbs because it was my ballast that was bad. If it's your ballast, you'll have to throw your entire expensive Ott light in the trash because they do not offer a replacement ballast. My overpriced Ott light is now a shameful lump in the landfill. I will never buy another Ott light. Ott probably sells lots of these bulbs to people who try to replace their bulb and find out that both items will now end up in their local dump..."
1,Ballast Catalog Number?,"Why does the ballast say ""Ott-lite Simple Reactance Ballast Cat. No. HB-18P-2 if there is no catalog and nowhere to buy the ballast?"
1,Why isn't there a zero star available? I would give OTT no stars,The OTT units are hyped up by ophthalmologists and others and not worth the price you pay. The ballast is junk and may outlast the lamp as did my MIL's. I can't find any way to replace the ballast or find a suitable replacement for it anywhere. I've gotten better reading lights for less money @ IKEA. Problem there is that you can never get the same one twice as they keep changing them every six months.
1,Less than 200 hours,"Our bulb came installed in a floor reading lamp from Lowe's. To our surprise, after about 8 months and around 200 hours, the lamp stopped working so we are assuming it is the bulb. I went to lamp's plus today to p/u a new bulb and they are asking $49. for one. I did not buy it. I see them on the internet for $20.-$26. After reading all the negative feedback on this bulb, does anyone have a resolve regarding this bulb?"
2,Not everything was Ok!,"The scent is very good for little kids, but the product arrive without box, cover and with a sticker ""tester only, not for sale"""
3,Slide rule manual: Log Log Duplex Decitrig No. 4081,This book is a great starter for the slide rule. It would be nice find a manual that goes in depth for the other scales on the ruler.
3,Handy,Teh manual came in handy in trying to explain the slide rule to a person who had never seen one.
5,Deep House At Its Finest,"This has instantly become one of my favorites. I first discovered Physics on a Bargrooves Compilation CD. The song was Don't Deny Me Love. The music and the lyrics instantly grabbed me and I knew that I had to hear more from this group. I am so glad I dug a little deeper to find this souful, deep house CD. Each song is solid and stands alone...there are no fillers here. Serve a la mode, with good wine, good company, and mellow moods."
4,Physics - First Flight,"FIRST FLIGHT is a atrong debut from Swedish housers, Physics, balancing upbeat grooves with blissful melodies. ""Don't Deny Me Love"" has the sound of Naked Music at its height, while ""Movin'"" gets you to do just that. They also dabble in more downtempo future jazz: ""Flying Away"" gives appropriately mellow results, but ""Give a Little Bit More"" edges a little too much towards slick R&B. But ""The Most Beautiful Boy in Brazil"" takes a sun-drenched tour that makes you wish every day could be summer (and ""Summer"" only continues the feeling). Similarly, my personal favorite ""Leaving Monte Carlo"" goes for smooth uptempo breaks punctuated by some spoken French samples. ""Tie Me Down"" takes the album out on a more subdued house vibe. Frequent flyer miles, anyone?"
2,Poor choices of songs,"I guess it happens to all famous singers --- sometimes you produce a CD and it just flops --- this is an example of a mistake. Poor choice of songs, camera work --- but again, this is just my opinion. Someone else may like this CD --- that's life..."
5,great,This rug is great love the feel of it the colors are niceThis rugfeels like a soft throw on your feet.. i do need to place a padding under it..
4,"3/8"" NPT should be 1/4"".","Impact wrench works great but I have two issues. First of all, the connector should be 1/4"" NPT not 3/8"". Secondly, it's harder than it should be to find the notch that the dial should be turned to in order to set the maximum torque. Having said that, this is a very good product and I would recommend it's purchase.It's hard to find impact wrenches like this one that can actually be used to tighten without the risk of applying too much torque. Most other wrenches that have torque limiting features don't specify what the maximum torque is at each setting. Without this information, you really have no idea how much torque your applying and the adjustment feature loses its value."
2,Not For Lug Nuts,While this is probably far better made than a lot of the options that can twist a lug nut - don't buy this if that is what you are wanting it for. I didn't realize that any impact wrenches were available that wouldn't turn lug nuts. Look into one with more ft/lbs of torque if that is what you need it for.
2,Not Worth the Money,"Five minutes out of the package, a piece fell off the light saber handle and had to be glued back on. One week later the light no longer works and it's not the batteries, but the connection with the switch. All in all, everything feels chintzy and cheap and I'm embarrassed I spent the money that I did on it."
2,Great for a day,"My 9 year old son was very excited to be Darth Vader for Halloween. He thought the light saber was great, until the base of the battery compartment fell off during his Halloween parade at school. We couldn't find it anywhere, and the light won't work unless you have the base attached. Big bummer, as the light was going to be very important while trick-or-treating in the dark. It caused a lot of drama on Halloween, and I wouldn't recommend this product if you want quality."
2,Darth Vador Costume,The costume was very cheaply made. The facemask was all plastic with a velcro strap and the suit was a foam pullover. The light saber broke within the first day of having it. Unimpressed with this purchase.
2,Falling apart,This bed is nice to look at but has hardly been used and is falling apart already. I think paying a little more for a bettter quality bed would have been more worth my money.
5,Perfect 1st bed,"I love that this bed has a trundle, mind you the trundle won't hold too many things, but we are able to store some extra blankets in it. It really it quite beautiful for a toddler bed (especially for the price). Our son's room is a priate theme and the bed fits the room perfectly."
4,Great for a beginner.,"If your into beginning the journey of double penetration or single 'backdoor' pleasure, than this is for you. It's not too big, not too long, and just right. I had gotten a much bigger and bulkier strap-on one previously but couldn't handle it but maybe some of the time in the double penetration area. So I thought I'd downgrade and buy something a little more smaller. This is what I came up with buying.I'm satisfied with it, so there's no problem. Shipping was discrete, which is always a plus. Don't need the neighbors running screaming from the mailboxes because they accidentally got my 'package'. Lol.Blessings to all!Sincerely,Mz. Anne."
5,Perfect starter size!,"Tantus has an exceptional line of high quality products. While I am very experienced with backdoor play, this was my wife's first attempt, and I wanted something that would not frighten her. Like a long index finger, the size is ideal -- maybe 3/4"" diameter. The purple color gave it a non-threatening feel, too. This toy cleans up easily with soap and water, and is discrete enough to tuck in your nightstand next to your favorite lube. Needless to saw, with a little time, a little lube, and this wonderfully non-intimidating toy, we were soon on the way to sharing a very special evening together. I've already ordered this in Medium, knowing she will quickly want to try a bit larger size!"
2,REALLY SMALL,"material is great- silicone, super smooth and comfortable once lubed up but dang this thing is so small. my bf says its such an awkward size that it doesnt really feel good or bad its just kind of there. idk. we bought the size small, so i def would get a medium or large if i were you.(great seller though! cheap and lightning fast shipping!)"
5,The Greatest !,Wife says the best ever ! Size and shape do the job like no other.This is used in a thigh harness primarily.
4,Wish it were harder,"It's a bit rubbery, but other than that, if you use lube it's great. You're basic dildo. PLUS, there is no odor like others I've tried in the past."
4,Nice,"There is a nice size, shape and curve to this toy but silicone is not supposed to be porous, yet it retains scents?!It's nice and really smooth. I would recommend it but probably not the highest quality silicone you could get. Works great with o-ring harness."
2,Tantus Lg (?) Silk Dildo,"While I'm not really rating the product itself low, I am rating how poorly Amazon and/or the company it came from, was in its descriptions and measurements that were given. Also, when I emailed someone at Amazon for a better definition of the measurements given, they were very vague. I shouldn't have purchased the object based on those lack of measurement descriptions, but when comparing the measurements to other similar items, I felt they were what I had hoped for. Alas, they were not. And since these objects can't be returned even if they are not used, I am out my money. A lesson learned."
4,"Simple, cost effective solution","I am an avid day hiker hiking at elevations from 2,000' to 7,000' two or three times weekly during the hiking season.The Brunton analog altimeter fully meets my need of having an accurate, easy to use and cost effective means to measure my altitude for the purpose of backcountry navigation.I like the fact that it does not have a lot of redundant functionality (I already own a wrist watch and compass).I've used it for three months now and find it to be rugged, light and easy to read."
1,"Very inconsistant and inaccurate, I sent it back.","I was really excited to be getting a mechanical altimeter and the the price was right and it is very lightweight. However, I was very disappointed with the accuracy of the product. It was consistently 200- 400 feet off. I would set it a known elevation and travel to another known elevation and it was always off. I would let it sit for several hours to make sure it was reading correctly, no help. I did this over a 10 day period to make sure. I do not recommend this product unless the accuracy of elevation does not matter."
4,and it pops out if you don't want the casing!,Bought this a while back and just now realized you can pop it out of the casing by pushing hard on the black dot in the back. Now it's even smaller and even more bag-friendly!
3,Okay for the money,"I bought this for a trip out west. Here at home we are at 550 feet above sea level and I wanted to keep track of the altitude as we traveled with our 5th wheel. My wife has a problem in the higher elevations. It wasn't the most accurate altimeter in the world but it was close enough fo my puposes. If you can live with plus or minus 100 feet or so, I guess it's worth it. I found myself resetting or adjusting the guage frequently (every other day or so) as we traveled and I would find a marker on the side of the road or at an airport."
4,Need to play with it awhile,"I haven't had the time to really check elevation with it, I will get back on that later. I have found that setting your exact elevation and waiting for awhile that it works for the barometer, with mine I give it light tap in the palm of my hand & reset the elevation & take my baromteric reading is sometimes off by one mark & sometimes ride on, but then my other barometer could be off or even the weatherman, as far as I can tell its working fine. Take some time & patience to play it. I almost sent mine back!"
1,Brunton Digital ADC Summit,Bought this altimeter several years ago and has been in the drawer ever since. Not nearly as accurate as a simple analog and a real joke to calibrate. Trying to reset or adjust functions puts you into an undesipherable maze. Finally lost patience and smashed it!! I will stick to analog altimeters.
5,Excellent Altimeter,This is an accurate analog altimeter. I just traveled across the USA with it and it agreed with known altitudes within the readability of the instrument. It also comes out of the case for possible alternate mountings. GOOD value!
5,Handheld Altimeter,"The Brunton mechanical altimeter is well made and accurate within our needs. We evaluated our unit on an auto trip from Houston, TX to Boulder, WY, a trip that spans elevations from 125 feet to 7000 ft. Using barometer settings that we obtained each evening online, we calibrated the altimeter and found it to be within 25-40ft of published altitudes at summits and city-limit signs along the road. This is great for our purposes considering one needs no batteries and the response is instant."
4,altimeter could use an in-car mount system,Face dial is great. Weird shape of body makes it tough to mount nicely in an automobile. Seems to me Brunton could make more money if they designed it for both hiking AND automobile application. It comes with a neck lanyard (nylon strap for buckle attachment is folded under in photo.
4,a good resource,"comprehensive, eloquent and easy-to-use guidebook on using nature's wonders for your health. A nice compendium to add to other sources."
1,Not very tasty results,"This book is well written and includes helpful reminders about how to slice and dice various vegetables; however, after scrupulously following several recipes, I've been disappointed and even disgusted at the results. I'm not sure the authors understand how to balance ingredients or how to season food so that it tastes good."
3,Not just for dummies,"OK, so this is the third book that I bought for my neice, so that she won't burn her first apartment down trying to make dinner for herself and her roommates. This is a good, basic little book that will provide her with some recipes that she can put together fairly easily, dump in the slow cooker, and have dinner ready when she returns from school. It's not real fancy, but the recipes look really good and easy enough that she can handle them. Would recommend this for teens, college students, and anyone who would like to use a slow cooker but doesnt' know where to begin."
2,SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED,"WHILE THIS BOOK MAY BE A GOOD GUIDE FOR THE BEGINNER USING A SLOW COOKER, IT DIDN'T TELL MY ANYTHING I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW. THERE IS FAR MORE INFORMATION ON PINTEREST THAN IN THIS BOOK."
3,Not what I had in mind,"I also was somewhat disappointed in this book. I was looking for a collection of easy-to-cook recipes, along with some helpful tips and suggestions for Crockpot cooking. However, there is really quite a bit of instruction and examples on food preparation, which is helpful, but there is not as much on what I think crockpot cooking is all about - a reasonably short prep time and worry-free cooking. Many of the recipes are based off of a ""main meat"" or ""main broth"" type of recipe - which means that you will first have to find the base recipe and then flip back to the recipe you are trying to prepare. Not as handy as I would have liked - especially for a "".... for Dummies"" book. There are probably some better choices out there."
4,Learn more about your slow cooker,"This is *not* a collection of slow cooker recipies. It *is* however, a far better replacement for the manuals that comes with most slow cookers though. There are recipies in the book, and they're good recipies. The value of the book though comes from the tips and techniques that will teach you how to do more with your slow cooker and how to adapt recipies to slow cookers. I definitely recommend this for people who are new to slow cooking (the ones who received it as a housewarming/wedding/graduation/other gift). Slow cooker pro's probably won't get much from this book (of course they're not dummies, so why are they buying a book for dummies?), but newbies and intermediate users definitely will get lots out of this book."
2,Horrible stroller,"Non stop problems with the front wheel. Folds fine, stores well, but the rear brake seizes all the time and the front wheel constantly gets stuck. Don't buy this one. The car seat that goes with it works fine in the car with the landing apparatus, although the metal latches tend to bend and have to be re-bent every now and then in order to accept the chair. Buy a different product, you'll be better off."
3,Gospel Bluegrass Home coming vol 2,"The cd was fine and works ok,as I expected; However the case was broken and I replaced it. I did not expect that."
1,The worst piece of garbage ever to take up space on film,"It is amazing that any moron with a video camera can get their reel of trash on DVD or even worse, on pay per view and charge people to sit through the boring, pointless, mindless drek. No character, no plot, no script, no action, no ending, and no point. The four and five stars given here are clearly the (cough cough) director and (choking here) actors reviewing their own worse-than-student film-grade mess. If this festering piece of garbage was shown in an intro to film-making class, it would get a D-. A pathetic waste."
1,Waste of the time,"Primitive, no story, no actor's play. Perfect sample how not to make movies. Do not recommend to anyone. That's it."
1,Evil Things,"The movie is boring. I have amazon prime, so it was free. I would really be upset if I paid money to watch it. It comes across like a college project for a film class. The techniques of filming were good, but the characters were irritating and there were too many holes in the plot. I would not recommend it. Its one of those movies where a person cheers to the bad guy to finish up so the movie can end."
3,I Liked It...,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the title of this movie didn't fit. I also thought it was a movie about the supernatural, but, I didn't think it was so bad. It had it's suspenseful moments, and it kept me interested enough to finish the whole movie.You just have to watch it with an open mind, and not compare it to other movies."
1,was this done by 1st graders?,"horrible acting,horrible plot,horrible filming,this is the worst movie ive ever seen! it made no sense other than a van following these morons. the 1.20 i lost renting this from redbox hurts but not near as much as the time ill never get back! avoid this film at all costs,it would make good torture device if you can force your enemies to watch it! its worse than watching mitt romneys run for president,and thats pretty bad!"
2,not what i like,It was non conclusive and not really letting you know what was happening. Not even a little bit. Two stars.
1,best trailer ever,When i saw the trailer for this movie months ago i thought it was going to be the next blair witch project or paranormal activity. I was definately wrong. The person who created the trailer for the movie did an amazing job. I was very disappointed by the lack of scare moments in the movie. From the trailer i thought for sure it was going to be something it was not. Almost like a paranormal activity type.The story was ok but definately something we have all seen a thousand times already. Typical cookie cutter shot on home movie crap.Please save your movie and rent this one instead. Very boringgggggg
2,UTTER GARBAGE!!!,"a killer who is everywhere and nowhere to be found, pointless, gratuitous clicking sounds, pointless harassment, able to take out 5 individuals. i got it! he's a ninja. a snow ninja. i'm getting really tired of seemingly infallible and invincible stalker type killers. they always know exactly what to do to hinder their prey and always manage to cower out of sight. if you are going to write a script of this sort, make it halfway believable. as i said, GARBAGE!"
5,A reality thats not too far away!,"This book is an example of how our lives can be derailed. It is a staggering depiction of a futuristic, post-war urban horror that grips the minds of readers. The sudden twists of chance that the story unravels are a trait of the author that manages to glue the reader to the book."
3,"A skillfull, monotonous work","""In the country of last things"", is - as many other novels by Paul Auster - a show-off in artistic brilliance and postmodern narratives. My sole criticism is that the the work lacks in sensibility in the portrayal of his characters (they seldom become anything other than segments of flesh - and in this novel, even despite his immense sharing of the protagonist's ponderings over his existence). Yet, I cannot deny that I was full of admiration from reading some very poetic depictions from this futurustic world Paul Auster has created in ""In the country of last things"". Unfortunely he never succeds in yielding anything a life beyond the stunning surface, and therefore and sadly his works have a tendency to turn into the monotonous. Often do I get the impression that Paul Auster is a smart and first-class craftman but a mediocre artist."
3,It`s so deppressing!,I've read the spanish version and my opinion is that this is a young Paul Auster very inferior to the author of Moon Palace or Smoke.
3,A Very Average Book.,"This book isn't fantastic, but it isn't horrible either--it is very average. It's interesting to read about a reality so different from the current one; where people think only about how to survive from day to day, and can't even consider pursuing happiness or frivolity. But by the same token, while it's interesting to see how this destitute society functions, it's hard to really feel connected to any of the characters (even Anna, the protagonist), so the climax doesn't really feel like one, and the ending seems rather ho-hum. But it's short, and some of the more subtle ideas about how people work in society are compelling enough to merit taking a look through this book. But read Auster's Music of Chance or something else first, or else you might get turned off of a very good author because of this very average book."
4,Austere Auster As Always,"Mr. Rogers never lived in Auster's neighborhoods. This dystopian tale of an unidentified city falling apart and reverting to anarchy will leave you shivering. We don't know if this societal breakdown is really a world wide phenomenon or if it only affects this one city.My enjoyment was from the people, and their means of coping with continuing worsening of conditions. Nothing ever got better yet some still clung to hopes that tomorrow would be brighter; while others had totally given up.Auster wants you to have to think while reading his books and they are short enough for you to maintain your concentration. This was quite enjoyable."
2,"Existential, man.","For the love of god, will someone please confiscate Paul Auster's copy of Diamond Dogs? A substandard dystopic work that wears its less-than-profound philosphical ruminations on its sleeve, In the Country of Last Things is Auster's longest title and worst book ( the best would be Leviathan, in case you're wondering. ) Here, as in the New York Trilogy, his writing is far too Livres de Poche -- meaning spare and vague, like all Camus-influenced French fiction. Worse, he has no talent for imagery, which means that this book in no way approaches Riddley Walker as a post-holocaust vision, despite what the inside jacket says. ITCOLT isn't even as good as Martin Amis's sister novel Other People. I just really didn't care for all the high-concept ideas ( such as The Runners, who run in packs until they collapse and die. ) Too cute, far too cute. Avoid."
5,Great for newbies and soloists!,"This is a great CD. I am a newbie to djembe drumming, yet this CD gives me enough visual time with each rhythm to practice and to learn. It also works for my husband, who is an accomplished solist looking for new rhythms to use when leading a circle. We both love it!"
5,101 drum rhythms,"i am new to learning the djembe, i was trying to use utube but i found i needed more assistance. i purchased this cd and also the dvd to go along with it and its awesome.....it really helps to have a visual to see the hand strikes along with the rhythm. i would highly recommend this to anyone who just starting or anyone who wants to learn additional rhythms to add on to their skill level. the delivery was very fast and it came well packaged to prevent any damage. it was a pleasure doing business here! thank u!! christy"
2,Dunkirk Crescendo... Anticlimactic at best.,"If you've read my other reviews on the newest installments to the Zion Covenant series you'll know I'm an avid fan. However this book fails to impress in SO many ways. To put it best 99% of this book is made up of the latter third of The Twilight of Courage. It only includes a few very minor changes and, to be honest, most of the loose threads of the story and plot are summed up in the two-page epilogue. Terribly disappointing to say the least."
3,Dunkirk Crescendo,"Out of all of the Zion Covenant books, this one was my least favorite. Too many battle scenes, and not enough character development. If you like to read about battles, you'll probably like this book more than I did, but if not, you'll probably find yourself skipping paragraphs, just like I did!"
5,World War II before the US became involved.,"Still reading this one, but have found it to be just as interesting and exciting as her previous work. B. Thoene carries multiple story lines through her books and makes them all of interest to her readers."
3,It's getting too formulaic.,"While I greatly enjoyed the original series, the last three books (London Refrain, Paris Encore, Dunkirk Crescendo) are formulaic add-ons far below the quality of the books in the original series. Most of the material in these three books appeared previously in the book The Twilight of Courage. These three books are a thin excuse for an additional set of titles to publish (and of course, to sell), and left me feeling cheated."
1,Disgusting Flag,"I bought this flag new from the seller and when I got it it was covered in yellow and brown stains. Not just one little spot, three or four big spots. It's gross."
3,From a college student,"The complete Human Body is, for a title, optimistic at best. The level of detail is good for up to the 8th grade. The bones are named, but the fossa's, condyles, foramen's and Etc. are not.Sections of the brain are listed, but detailed descriptions are not. The nervouse system is not broken out into specific nerves. Nueurotransmitters are mentioned and illustrated in a cartoon animation but no detail is provided. Muscles are named, but no details of the connections are provided.The graphics are good and this is suitable for children, but the box advertises this product as a ""A solid resource for anyone with an interest in the Human Body"" and it is nothing more than a childrens game."
1,Desert Reading,This book lacks any ability to take you back in time. There is no dialouge among charachters. Although the stories may be true ... they are told in an history book format. There is no sense of who the characters really are or how they were perceived by their peers.If you've ever read any Alan Eckert... you will be deeply disapointed in the lack of detail and content.Buck
1,Spelling!!!!,"I can't believe there's a spelling error in the item description. Chord organ is CHORD, not cord!"
1,Disgusted!,"I give NO stars, (I had to check one of them) not because of the CD material. That I was not able to listen to. I have an older system and sometimes it will not play new CD's. sucks but true. I have contacted the seller and requested information on returning this item. They WILL NOT process a refund. Personally, I feel that when a company will not refund money for their product, then they know there have been previous issues and are just out to make a buck. This to me is not good business at all. If you decide to purchase this item, you're stuck with it. (unless you sell it, or use it as a frisbe)"
5,thinking about selling,"i love andromeda but there is a new box set with all 5 season here available on amazon and its a lil over $100 but worth the purchase, slim casing and ""ONE"" sided discs!! something i prefer! its a space saver as well!"
3,"Going, Going, Gone...","Although the series had a good start, on the overall, it has fallen from grace. The producers thought that having a war and an arch-enemy on the loose will do good for the series, but they are streching it a bit too much. the characters have become more talkative and more philosophical, sometimes to apoint that they make no sence and contradict themselves. The whole ""Dylen the Massayah"" idea has become exadurated and un-believable. All in all, it's an OK series, but no more. The Imagination of Gene Rodenberry is lost on this series, and it shows."
3,Great product....bad timing!,"This is the way I wanted to buy Andromeda DVDs, not the other way. But I should have seen it coming, because the disks are individually numbered 1 through 10 for the season. Unfortunately, I already bought them, 2 disks at a time, at a much higher price for the 5 sets. I, like everybody else, get steamed when publishers do this. Consider yourselves warned."
1,"White birthrate to blame, not Islam",The book is based on false premises and a lack of broader understanding. There wouldn't be millions of Muslims in Europe if the White Europeans didn't have such a low birthrate. The Muslims arrive there for work and those countries need their labor. Are Arabs to blame because Euros refuse to have children? I don't think so.
3,It would suck to live in Europe,"Europeans appear to view themselves as intellectually superior than Americans. However, didn't all the ""smart"" Europeans get killed in the Shoah, immigrate to Israel and immigrate to the U.S.? Who is left? The people that are left are too stupid to realize another culture is invading. The people that are left are too stupid to realize that the culture, which is invading, thinks of the native Eurpeans as dogs.Europeans are like the California Condor. The Condor was going to go extinct as part of natural selection. The Condor species was too stupid to live and adapt in the current times."
3,"Millions seek Asylum, and Truth","Jetenderpaul Presents the Modal Lines ASIN: B000056BLQHow should I word it with such help one's to be given. Jetenderpaul's album ""Presents the Modal Lines"" is like a waft of cool air breezing through my hair. The tones and overall feel of the album is like driving down the highway on a Harley Davidson: wind blowing through your beard, the hum of the road, the smell of gas and oil. Freedom. That word means many things to many people. For jetenderpaul it is a word of great consequence. They have dared to talk seriously about the problems of the world and the need for freedom, hope, trust, etc... I wave my hands to you, jetenderpaul, I raise my ebeneezer also. I think it a fitting tribute to this record to call it a triumph for ""action recording."" (This is a word that I've made up for just this occasion.) From the day I bought there record until now, I have sworn myself to listen to music recorded with action and pizzest. I will not cease until that day is through."
4,Words from on higher places,"Jetenderpaul Presents the Modal lines ASIN B000056BLQNot only is jetenderpaul's Moduler lines helpful, it is also written with good intents and purposes. There are so many shine-out moments on this cd, that the reviewer (I) is having and has several times had trouble naming one or two in particular. For starters, there's good rhyming. In my book, that's not without it's pluses and minuses. Don't get me wrong, with songs like tracks 4(?), 5, 8, an 17 jetenderpaul can't expect to hide behind secret pleasures and double intendres for long. In conclusion, there are two things. Oh, and how could i forget the smiles artwork and general packaging brought to my eyes. ALl in all a real good treat, or so."
5,better than the travel scrabble games,"This game is great. Because the board folds up, but unfolds into a full size game board, and the pieces are regular sized scrabble pieces, I turned this into my travel scrabble game. it fits nicely into a zip-lock bag and my family and I take it on every vacation, play scrabble on planes, trains, and everywhere in between. If you don't like those little tiny pieces of the official travel scabble set, this is the solution. The board is not recessed, so it won't withstand movement, but it is a wonderfully portable scrabble set and we have enjoyed it tremendously."
1,Why does the FHU no longer offer this book?,"I read this book in the early 1980's. What a bold title for a book that explains if you do Roy's meditation and follow it closely to the point where you no longer react to anything whatsoever -- YOU WILL NOT DIE!!! He wasn't kidding either, he literally meant not dying physically, ever. Is it perhaps the fact that Masters is inching closer and closer to his own inevitable demise that this book is off his list of offerings and the only way you can get it anymore is to order it from Amazon -- ?Maybe Roy should follow this up with a sequel book entitled, ""Yep You're Gonna Die After All You Buncha Jerks"" in which he berates the hell out of everyone for not following his program and believing in him enough to actually make it work for HIM as well."
1,Don't buy this from these guys.,"I was very disappointed when I opened my package and did not find the Clue set that is pictured above. Instead, I found the set with the purple front with a straight ""spine"". The main difference: about $20. So don't buy this game from them if you're expecting the one pictured. Go somewhere else and buy it for half the price. I did receive a refund on my purchase, but I was really hoping for the curved spine which I haven't been able to find anywhere. I was willing to pay the extra $20 to have the curved spine because it would have matched my Risk game and it must be a rare item now.Bottom line: chech the prices of the other sellers first before buying this one."
2,Porter Cable Done me Wrong,So here i am waiting untill my Pay comes in so i can Buy this Stupid thing.Now wait... its great for grinding but lets hope you dont break alot of wheels because you have to use tools.....Thats right tools to change the Wheel/Brush or what ever your using at the time because they dicided that a Spindle lock wouldnt be in you best intrest???Well either way im Mad...Now im even more upset because when i bought it the guy gave me this spindle attachment so i can use my old WireBrush and other stuff on it but guess what....The attchment dosnt have the same threads so now im [done] because i didnt buy an Electric Angle Grinder...
4,Essential live recording,If only for the 8 minute extended drumming break at the end of Bughudia. If this isn't able to get you moving you're dead!Still available directly from Womad Select online btw.
2,Zipper failed during trip,"Our zipper failed while the rest of the tent was still in good condition. With Eureka's recommendation we replaced the zipper pull, and that lasted for a few trips and then failed again. We ended up using safety pins to hang a fleece blanket against the door during our last trip when the zipper quit. Fortunately there weren't many insects and the wind wasn't so bad that the blanket door caused problems, and we had a nice trip. But it's time to upgrade from this tent to one of the outfitter tents or something with a more hefty zipper.I'm afraid I can't recommend this tent or any other tent with less than a #10 zipper."
4,One flaw,"I set my new tent up in the backyard, and it is really easy to erect, even in a breeze. I see one flaw that I can not understand the designers did not catch. The rainfly , in the rear , seems to be a foot or so short. It looks to me like a strong rain coming straight at the rear of the tent will go directly into the upper mesh window, which can not be closed. I have not used the tent yet, and this may not turn out to be an issue, but I plan on being prepared with a tarp, just in case. Like everyone else I hope the poles last."
2,Nice Tent but Poles Suck!,"The first time we set the tent up one of the a fly poles broke. The second time we set up the tent the other fly pole broke ( and I was being cautious because of what happened the last time). I do have to say that it poured the first night we used the tent and we stayed dry. It's cramped if you have a queen size blow-up mattress, so it then becomes a two person tent. There was just enough room around the mattress to crawl and get out. I would buy something bigger the next time."
1,CHEAP,"The first time my husband and I used this tent the poles snapped and tore the tent (just as another user said). The day was pefect, sunny NO WIND, NO RAIN and after a day of kayaking the tent was in shambles on the ground with the snapped pole. Nowhere else to sleep . . .We've owned another tent that lasted a couple of years - this was a one time use and didn't make it through 8 hours."
4,gREAT dEAL!,"This is a grat little tent. It has plenty of space for two adults and it withstood a Burning Man dust strom, more than once. It is easy to set up. i am a basic non camper so it only took me a few minutes to set this tent up and secure it. We loved this tent. Can't wait to try it again."
4,Summertime Tent,We are very happy with this tent. We were looking for a little bit bigger one that we could stand up and change clothes in. We needed a tent that we could keep our clothes dry and us warm. It is more of a summertime tent than a cold weather tent. It's perfect for just the two of us and a big dog...not much room for more.
4,Eureka family tent,Easy set up and break down. It appears to be a good value. I wish here was a large vestibule with this tent.I would recommend this tent for family camping.
1,Eureka tents are junk!,"I had the same experience as the other reviewer, D. Hammond. One of my poles broke the second time I used it! The winds were light, and my metal brackets connecting the pole sections also started to bend. Eureka is bordering on fraud selling such a poor-quality tent. I've camped extensively for 20 years and I've never heard of such a bad tent, even among the cheap childrens tents parents set up in their back yards! Do yourself a favor and avoid Eureka products!"
2,Disappointed with Eureka,"After two uses, I had to return this tent due to three different failures. The first was my fault; I dropped a hot rock on the tent floor, burning a hole through the bottom. Cold night and too much beer, I guess. Easily patched, though. On the second trip out, the mesh tore at the seam, and one of the poles failed before we even started putting up the tent. I called Eureka directly, and they were happy to repair the tent for me... as long as I paid shipping both directions. I was not happy enough with the tent to go through that process.Amazon was terrific, and gave me a full refund. My last Eureka tent lasted nearly twenty years, finally failing when it fell off my roof rack at seventy miles per hour. They just don't seem to be made like they used to be."
5,Great tent so far!,"In the three weeks I've owned this tent, I have tested it three nights, once under heavy rain, and it did not leak. I like the high quality of the tent as well. Seems like a good balance of features and cost.Because the poles are so long, it is tricky (but not impossible) to set up without help. However, with two people, it was a snap. I doubt anyone's going to go camping alone in a 9 x 9 tent anyway!"
3,Quality questions?,"I have some questions about the quality of some screw driver bits, they break ease and will not stand heavy screws on wood. Maybe good on very light dutty."
1,stanley drill and drive bit set,"stanley created a good reputation over the years for a good line of tools, not any more. I bought this productbecause of the name, thought I had invested in good name brand tools. Very disappointed, made of cheap soft steel.drive bits are wore out after very short useage. this turned me against the stanley name brand. very poorlycrafted, not worth the price, I won't buy any more stanley products."
4,Homeowner perfect,This is a great kit for the average homeowner to have on hand. The product could have come with an owners manual explaining the useage of some of these tools.
5,A Rip-Snortin' Wild West Adventure,Looking for a picture book you won't mind reading over and over? Here's a lively western tall tale that will have your little buckaroos riding off to dreamland in chaps and ten gallon hats night after night. Pattie Schnetzler's rollicking language and Rick Sealock's energetic illustrations will make this lively story a favorite in libraries and classrooms as well. Teachers will find inspiration for a writing lesson that fits right in with the Western Expansion unit of U.S. history. It's funny. It's lively. It has a hero everyone will love. Widdermaker is a winner!
1,Buyer Beware,ReallY? You're kidding me. This 'video' is just a photo slideshow set to elevator music. Give me my ******* money back!
5,I second Taylor...,"Juke's rolling tunes have provided so many memories. My teen years were filled with their cd. Everytime I pop the cd in, i can think of good times as i listen to this genuinely great band. The cd is wonderful. Way worth the money."
4,Building a space shuttle from a car. Great fun.,"If you are a fan of Mythbusters, this is an episode for you. The Top Gears guys go for broke and build a functioning rocket from an odd three wheeled car. The shear ambition of it old is mind boggling. For you Top Gear purists, this is actually episode four of the series. For some reason, Amazon does include the actual EP1."
2,Where's the real first episode?,"Shouldn't the first episode be the one where Richard tells us about his accident? The one that was a major part of his book that he wrote? I love the show, but it is frustrating to not have the full season available."
1,Pick out the worst and bash it,You could go to any country and pick out the worst and only show the worst. Of course that is what it appeared they did. They had their stereotypes and they made sure that they showed them.
3,Star in Reasonably priced car missing,In Episode 6 Billie Piper's lap round in the Reasonably Priced car is cut out! I want to see it!
4,Great but Season Incomplete,"Probably for PC reasons, this season is incomplete as the 1st episode (Which covers the aftermath of The Hamster's crash as well as the Boys taking over Public Road Works) isn't allowed to be seen. (Either as per the request of Richard Hammond for obvious reasons or because some Dwayne Johnson film loving fan in a suit and tie thinks it's too sensitive a subject for us to see)It is rather... idiotic that this is the case because they can easily edit out Hammond's segments regarding the crash (Heck it has been done as there are plenty of Top Gear episodes sold that are shorter to varying degrees from their original versions)"
4,Great Gospel-grass,"This is a great video of some of the best bluegrass gospel you'll hear anywhere! Bill Gaither has put together a great concert, especially one outside his normal southern gospel style!"
5,Great music,"This dealer was great. Fast servide and a great prduct.Would order drom this dealer againDescriptiom of this product was ""right on""."
1,The Eureka Extended Stay - 8 Person 2 Room Tent,"Eureka Extended Stay 19- by 14-Foot Eight-Person Family Tentis no good. Its poor design made it function like a huge parachute. I set it up in my back yard to apply seam sealer and the tent disintegrated in less than 24 hours in a 10 to 15 MPH breeze. I had attached all clips to the poles and the tent was fully staked except for one loop inside, which stabilized the door in the room divider. The two main fiberglass poles that supported the rain fly split lengthwise and then sheered in two. The tent collapsed to the ground and could not be righted without replacement parts. I cannot believe that Eureka put their name on this tent."
5,1+hr of Sublime,"If you love Early Music, you simply can't go wrong with Jordi Savall.If you are new to this music, just listen to the samples.This album is pure balm for the soul, a treasure for your collection, which you'll return to again and again.And for the price of ONE import CD, you can download TWO Jordi Savall MP3 albums from Amazon - to my ear, they sound perfect. Yeah!"
4,Pretty good lighting ...,"Out of the many lighting system out there in the market, the ott-light produces decent lighting which does not put much strain on the eye after prolong period of usage. I particularily like the flexible arm which extend about 2 1/2 feet and is very malleable. If you're an avid reader or need an extra clamp on lamp in the room the Ott-light will suit you well. The only complain I have is the price which is considerably high. Until next time..Gary"
1,Nice design - too bad it doesn't work,"For the second time, I'm packaging up this light for return (at least Amazon makes that part easy). As with my original purchase, this replacement is defective. The light will only work when I spend a few minutes wiggling the bulb, and then it only stays on for intervals of a few minutes at a time. When it works, it emits a wonderful light, and I love the design of the lamp (desk clamp-on model). Too bad the manufacturer hasn't worked out the quality control issues. My experience makes it extremely unlikely that I will ever purchase another product from this manufacturer."
5,Lets me read again,"This lamp is a wonderful device! As a lifelong reader in bed I noticed lately that I was having less and less enjoyment from my books and magazines, more eyestrain and general fatigue. Incipient middle age? Need reading glasses? I am in my early forties. No, No, No, I was using a poor light, glary and dim.Once the easy to install Ott Lite was clamped to my night table and turned on I could immediately tell the difference. No glare, very even illumination, bright, not yellow or reddish, seems like the light outside on a clear day.Now I am anxious to read again. I feel like a twelve year old kid. That special hour or two before sleep is MY time. Way less fatigue a lot more fun. Expensive yes but well made and the bulb lasts a reported 10,000 hours ( thats maybe 9 years at 3 hours or so per day).Well, well worth the money for someonewho treasures the act of reading."
5,wonderful,Finally a true R & B singer without the booty calls!! Sounds like soul has been born again!!
4,Musiq's Sound alike,"This cd is pretty nice. I have about 3 favorite songs that really dominate the whole cd. But this cd is good enough to listen to all the way through without getting annoyed. The three songs to listen too is ofcourse Dont You Forget it, This Love and Simple Things. Glenn sounds so much like Musiq it is not even funny on some tracks and he even has a Stevie Wonder Vibe. He will be compared to either of these artist for a long time. And they are both great artist so he has best of both worlds. I just hope that Glenn will find his own style so he can shine in his own light. One Love"
3,a Little Better than Average but not Stevie,"He has listened to alot of Stevie but so has only like 999 others.He has some Moments but Overall He is missing that Song.that kind of Song that Blew up D'angelo,Maxwell.He doesn't have that kind of Song but He is a Alright Artist.I Feel Him&Eric Benet kinda Cancel Each other out.Production helps this Album out but time will only tell thus far He is Alright.but He ain't anywhere Close to Even 80's Stevie Let Alone Classic 70's Peak Era Wonder."
1,"NO,GLENN,DON'T YOU FORGET TO STOP BITING STEVIE!!","The title of the review says it all,Glenn Lewis is yet a smooth-talking,unhoned R&B cat trying to do the ""neo-soul"" thing.Notworking.One radio friendly single and good press don't make a good CD.Half done R&B pap posing as ""serious soul"".Skip this."
2,"DISSAPOINTING ""E"" for effort!","I was feverishly awaiting for March 19,2002 to get here to RUN out and get Glen Lewis's Debut CD ""World outside my window"". This CD lacks flow & substance, all the songs sound the same. And NO! I was not expecting booty call music or anything like that. I really like his voice, my reason for wanting this CD was because of the single ""Don't you forget it""..Yes, he does sound a lot like Stevie Wonder but he does have his own distinctive flava. I have downloaded 3 of his songs that are not on this CD but should have been..If ya get a chance check them out!They are ""Bout your love"", ""Only be in love"" and ""Too Much"""
2,Not what I expected,"When I heard ""Don't you forget it"" I was absolutely blown away. I was quite impressed with the feel of the song. My thought was, ""this guy reminds me of Stevie (Wonder)."" Being that Stevie Wonder is my favorite musician, I was excited to hear what the rest of the CD sounded like, so I bought it.It was not what I expected. Way too many slow songs for my taste. ""Beautiful Eyes"" was the only other track I really got into. I believe that if Glen gets better production behind him like he did in those two tracks he will sell a lot of units (cds/tapes). Get it if you like a lot of slow songs. If you don't, wait for his next project."
5,A Classic!!!,"this album is all a person could ask for in a purchase, every song tells a clear story and sounds uniquely different from the others while keeping the same style."
2,WOMW....well it's not lookin 2 good out there,"i don't know, I am feeling don't You forget it but I just can't get into the rest, he does nothing for me, and i'm just stating my own opinion!"
4,Glenn Soulchild (Music Lover from Philly),I know this debut by Glenn Lewis has to make Musiq Soulchild very happy because he hasn't even been out that long and already he is an influence to a new singer. He sounds so much like Musiq on some of the tracks that it's not even flattering but he is so incredibly talented that you can overlook the style biting. This one won't jump out at you right away. I had to listen to it about 5 times before I discovered my favorites. He has potential but he has to figure out how to get out there is own way without riding the whole Musiq/Stevie thing. He needs to keep coming. This debut is allright. Well above average.
3,He tried,"It's ok. It's just that simple. I'm sure most of you who have been brained washed by the lack of good music from today's artists ( i.e. Alica Keys among others), will think Glenn's album is wonderful. He has a great ""Stevie Wonder"", type of voice, but doesn't use it to inspier or invoke the soul like his frist single or like D'angelo did with the album Brown Sugar. I want some more brown sugar please!!! Glenn did alright for his frist time out, no more no less, but in a world of gloom and doom someone cast some ligth in this darkness."
3,... 5 + 5 = 3?...,"...five star production...five star voice...but i jus cant give this more than three stars...musiq done did this already...and when brother glenn aint soundin like musiq's stepchild, he's reminding me so much of stevie that i find myself wantin to lissen to mr. wonder instead...glenn shines the most when he does some actual singin, instead of that 'rhythmically speakin' approach that is more associated with musiq...he has his high points with this definitely, but if you gonna use stevie as your standard or style and you welcome the comparissons, then you really need to come strong with it!"
1,counterfiet,This isn't a new cd. It isn't a real cd either. The advertisement is wrong. Very fraudulent description. I'm deeply disappointed.
1,RUBBISH!,"MAKITA branded, but cheap chinese-quality belts (though they say made in Japan) - SANKYO. They burst really quick. If you receive Sankyo made product , return immediately, or check before purchase."
2,Nice to have but scissors hinge cover breaks off,"I like having this in my pocket as it is small and flat enough. The knife is very useful to have especially for opening envelopes or deliveries. The other tools (nail file, tweezers, pen, toothpick) are especially nice to have when you need them. The problem with this is that the hinged cover for the scissors has a tendency to open while in your pocket and when it does, it weakens the hinge until it eventually snaps off. The spring on the scissors also did not last long and broke into two making the scissors difficult to use.If this product had lifetime warranty, I would give it 5 stars but since it only came with a 30-day warranty when I got mine, it gets 2 stars."
5,A great book for summer (or anytime reading),"With all the recent attempts to make celebrities seem approachable and just like ordinary folk (if the Osbornes could ever be considered ordinary) Kun's book goes one step further and let's us see what happens when one man attempts to re-connect with someone he knew before she was famous.The results of Sid Straw's attempts, and the resulting misunderstandings, take us for an extremely funny ride, providing biting commentary on lawyers, parents, relationships, work and even more lawyers.The creative way in which the story is presented, as a ""simple"" series of letters, notes and memos, carries you along with great ease and expertly conveys the story of this hapless but lovable individual.With a keen ear for language and a wry sense of humor, Kun has created a must-read book, not just another piece of ""summer reading"". More importantly, it's a book that you will want to recomend to your friends and read again and again."
5,Truly Hysterical,This is one of the funniest and most original books I've read in a long time. Take a chance on it -- you won't regret it!
2,Glimmers of Promise,"I found this book very ""thin,"" something I'm sure was due in part to the fact that this is an epistolary novel and one with very short epistles! I think, had Kun developed the book, and his character of Sid Straw, let him interact with others in scenes, the book might have had some substance. As it is, I got no real sense of Sid Straw as a person and I didn't care one bit about his plight. Everything in this book is so ""on the surface"" that it's almost impossible to care.And funny? There were one or two glimmers of potential humor, but that's as far as I'll go and even with that, I'm being generous. I got so sick of reading the phrase, ""Eat Wheaties!"" over and over and over again that I just began skipping it.I might try another novel of Michael Kun's but I'm returning this one to the store where I bought it."
2,Science for drama majors,Really boring and some of the author's words were more confusing than any mathematical equation. I was very disappointed with this one.
4,PC gravity sprayer,excellent product. works very well with stains and thinner paints. I purchased the larger latext needle and it work pretty good. there may be a learning curve I need to go through for the thicker material.
1,Beware the cleanup of this gun--get what you pay for,"Decided that I would take a chance for the price (less than 1/3 the cost of a Devilbliss gun). Until I actually used the gun to spray water based latex primer (using the 2mm accessory nozzle), I did not see the (6) ultra tiny jets that clogged up during use. Beware any gun that includes a cleaning brush with the kit, as this one does; it took about 1/2 hour to disassemble the gun and get it properly cleaned. By comparison, the better quality HVLP guns have no cranky secondary jets and no cleaning brushes. Spend the extra money if you value your time."
1,PSI and CFM requirements for this gun?,"Does anyone know the air requirements for this gun? I went to the PC website and this gun is not listed there. If you have this gun, please post this info. It looks like PC overlooked this when posting the editorial review. How about some technical info. as well. Will raise the rating with more information."
5,HOORAY FOR HVLP,"I have sprayed clear finishes on my woodworking projects for many years using a conventional spray gun. Although I have been able to achieve a quality finish, I was always disappointed by all the overspray and fog created in my garage. What a great pleasure it was to use the Porter-Cable PSH1 HVLP gun. Adjustments were smooth and easy; quality of finish was superb; and best of all, there was no fog to contend with. I'm sold. I'll never go back. Thanks for a great product."
4,"WHERE'S THE ""IDIOT SHEET""????","Only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating is the almost total lack of info that comes with the gun. Had to figure most everything out for myself, such as setting pressure, adjusting controls, etc. But, once figured out, the results are impressive for he price."
3,To cut a long story short,"When the gun arrived I was delighted, it looked like a $200 gun. When I used it however there was a leak at the nozzle tip. Needing to spray a job, I took the fluid nozzle to a machinist and had it bored out. In fairness to Porter cable, when I told them about this they dispatched me a new gun, but sadly, this one leaked at the reservoir cap."
4,almost perfect,one sentence. the plastic cup should be metal.I spray poly and the cap to the cup broke at the seams.Besides that small faul it works perfect.
4,i'm impressed,"i've done a lot of paint spraying over the past 10 years.I started with a cheap binks and gradually moved up the line .In my last job, i used an apollo hvlp sprayer and a fuji hvlp.i've had my share of successes and failures with paint spray systems.I've had three experiences with this sprayer so far.1. Primed a series of metal cabinets, bases and tops.2. Painted a very textural stucco wall3. sprayed some fine detailed architectural castings.the gun worked wonderfully. i'm pretty stunned that for the price i got such good results. Very smooth finishes.. though not the piano finish i got with the apollo. Never clogged and VERY easy to clean, which is very important to me.the various needle sizes seem rediculoulsty expensive to me ( $22.00 on amazon), but the gun is such a good deal that i think it will still be very economical.oh.. i did have a bit of moisture build up.. something that a turbine dedicated hvlp gun doesnt. i guess i'll be getting a moisture trap for it."
4,Excellent performer,"Bought it last week to finish a chiffarobe I've been restoring. I used it to spray shellac, using a PC pancake compressor. I had no problems once I figured it out.I recommend closing the fluid control valve to start out, and opening it slowly to figure out how much product to deliver. Also, make SURE you run mineral spirits through it to clean it.Other than that, its great."
4,Very Good sprayer,"Use this sprayer for custom kids furniture with the 2.2 mm tip and thin the paint. Mostly oil based enamels or metallic latex based coats. I get excellent results as long as the coats are dry between. I also use the 3M spray kit(disposable cups with filters built in) from Rockler for quick clean-up. Thicker material requires higher pressure unless thinned properly, but best results come from proper thinning and patience."
4,PSH1 Spray Gun,I purchased this spray gun and have used it several times. It has produced good results and I am completely happy with it. I did not have any problems (reported by others) with connecting the regulator and standard air hose fittings. I did use teflon tape on all threads.
2,The problem is in the cup,"This gun works fine for small jobs, but the plastic cup is shoddy and the top separates from the rest of the cup. Duct tape only works for so long.Further, they make adding a replacement cup impossible because the screw size is proprietary (non standard), and it is impossible to find a replacement cup through Porter Cable. They are genuinely disinterested in helping you."
5,The Best Crossword Book Ever!,"This is truly the best crossword book that I have ever worked. Having the choice of easy or hard clues just made it so much fun. I often leave at least a few puzzles unfinished before tossing a book, but I finished every single word of every puzzle in this book. I also loved the paper quality in this book. Pencil erased very well from it, so it was easy to correct mistakes. The size and weight of the book also makes it a perfect travel companion. I would love to see more of these books released --- this was the best!!"
5,The Best Crossword Puzzle Book Ever Written,I can't believe the quality of these puzzles. Manna from heaven!
4,"Richie is the master of catchy, minimal music.","I am always amazed by the difference between the frenetic Richie Hawtin DJ sets and his moody, minimal Plastikman albums. This album exemplifies the difference between his two personalities. There are a few slow tracks that don't grab me but the rest are sensational. When I listen very intellectually to the music I am stunned by how little music there is and yet how great it sounds. Richie has always written long songs that develop so subtley that you hardly notice yourself being sucked in. I abandon the intellect and enjoy the music and celebrate animate life. Richie has used wonderul vocals, effected of course, in the form of acid aphorisms and laments of the demise of his relationship with his girlfriend. Beautiful as always."
2,Closer to self-indulgence,"A little background: I have Plastikman's ""Sheet One"" and ""Consumed"", which I consider to be fine pieces of minimalist electronica. However, the tracks on ""Closer"" are too repetitive for my tastes, both within themselves and viewed in the context of each other; a lot of the tracks sound similar and lack a unique character, which pushed the envelope of monotony past my tolerence. The vocals, something new for a Plastikman release, were an annoyance: pretentious and ultimately a little trite.Sorry, I'm a fan of Plastikman but can't give this one very high marks. If you're just getting started on his stuff, check out ""Sheet One"" or ""Consumed""."
2,Bleh,"I'm a big fan of Plastikman, and this album just really did not excite me. It's not that it's minimal, it's that it doesn't have any vibe. the other plastikmans were very good. This is like a bad version of consumed. I think Hawtin turned into a self indulgent artist after moving to berlin. Hawtingot the hitler cut, started making more and more bad minimal techno.Hawtin's dj sets got more boring. and look what he's doing now, djing in the water in ibiza, can you get more asinine?I do like the last track, I dont know, well, besides for the lyrics, they do not need to be there. But even that sounds like a bad rip off something from artifakts.Dont get me wrong, i was pretty much a Plastikman fan boy for quite a while...but this album ruined it for me. So much so I had to come onto Amazon to write a review on it.I was enough of a Plastikman fanboy to buy a devilfish tb303 because of the records..."
4,"Good, yet Uneventful Sounding","I can't really say anymore about this album. I first found out about Plastikman while I was on YouTube searching for Aphex Twin videos, and stumbled upon a video of Disconnect. I loved the music and hoped the album would be even better. Turns out that the entire album is very odd, almost annoyingly. I give it a 4 star rating because the CD is an absolute trip to listen to if you're trying to fall asleep."
4,Fact and fiction.,"Reporter Joe Tinker is a sportswriter, when not drinking, sleeping around, or stumbling into crimes scenes, who can get the job done-when he's ready to get to it. The year is 1947, and Joe's latest assignment is to follow and interview Jackie Robinson in Cuba during baseball practice for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Making history as baseball's first black player is making waves around the world, and with all of the hate mail that Jackie has received, it's Joe that stumbles into a racial plot to have the ballplayer assasinated on the field of the first game. The author has blended history with fiction very well, except that the coincidences that led Joe to the murder in the making was very contrived. Pushing that to the side, it wasn't so much a mystery as it was slightly lopsided action novel with a better view of how hate can manifest itself to take over one's life. Pretty good."
5,Catlett works forever timeless,"this book is great reference of Dr. catletts works over the years. It shows her gret progression through the civil rights era, the transition of the poor of Mexico, and the plight of women all over the world. The 1946 ""Tired"" in terra cotta best shows the powerful works."
3,Time After Time Vol.2 - Not as good as the first Time,"If you liked the first Time After Time CD for its smooth mixes and fine selection of popular 80's tunes remixed, you are going to be a bit disappointed with Volume 2. Its still a nice collection - the pieces flow from one to the next, and each tune is a pretty good remix. However, I didn't KNOW each of the tunes they chose to remix in this volume (Volume 1 had selected 80's tunes most everyone would recognize), and the transitions from one to the next aren't as ""seamless"" as the first. You'll likely enjoy the collection, but it will NOT be the same musical experience as you had with Volume 1."
5,Fabulously Funny!,"Lampooning nearly every fairy tale at once, John Moore weaves a captivating tale of Prince Charming and the adolescent conflict between his duty to the kingdom's public relations image and his growing desire for freedom and a good time. Charming and friends are a fascinating bunch, very real characters in a magical and humorous world.This is one of my all-time favorite books and I've read it many, many times. John Moore, if you're out there, please write more books!"
5,Really really enchanting and seductive,"I have never read any book like it. It is the best I have ever read and now my favorite book in all the world. Surpasses ""The Princess Bride"" by a universal infinity. I have been inspired."
1,Just terrible.,"I bought this at a local music store hoping it would be something good. When I put it in the CD player in my car, I let it play for 30 seconds, and then ejected it. I immediately turned around and went back to the store to take it back and instead bought a much better CD (""Believe"" by Cher). Avoid this at all costs!"
4,Tony brings one home,"Tony Cuneo's video is a treasure house of Feng Shui information. Having spent much time studying secret societies, Tony embellishes the Feng Shui with local color. There is a great deal of information packed into this video and it needs to be watched several times to get everything out of it. Tony uses the technique of muscle testing to demonstrate the presence or absence of Chi in an area which adds a lot to the presentation. I use this video in my Feng Shui Classes and have heard nothing but praise from my students for it."
4,Cute costume,"The costume is cute, which is the main point. It was fairly roomy on my tall 19-month-old. Roomy enough for warm clothes underneath although the costume itself was fairly warm. The neck was a little tight and we had to leave the back unfastened at the top. The hat is cute but the whole costume is pretty scratchy on the inside, so getting her to keep the hat on was difficult (she normally wears hats well). It's pretty expensive for what it is. It all depends on what cute is worth for your first baby's first trick-or-treating."
3,Out of Package,The item was not new it was out of the package. I read the description and nowhere did it say out of the package.
4,Good fit and quality,Good fit and quality. My locks (Ankle lenth) fit in this with great comfort. No headaches from sqeezing them in other tams/beanies. Need them to get the Black one in stock.
3,Disappointing...,"After hearing about the ""Essence"" all these years, I finally ordered it and have to admit to disappointment. It seems underflavored and just doesn't pack the oopmh I was expecting. Doesn't taste bad or anything, but it also doesn't taste terribly distinctive either. I'll stick with mixing my own spices in going forward..."
3,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYOBRU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,"While it does not have as much BAM as I expected, it is still an interesting product."
5,What an exellent volume!,"As a rule I do not buy illustrated or coffee table books. I want substance, not nice pictures for my money.This book does have very beautiful pictures, but it also have a huge amount of real information - useful information. It covers the history, the structure, the practice, and meaning of Kabbalah in all its glory. This is a book recommended for the beginner and everybody else. The Tree of Life is particularly well covered."
3,Bratz again,"Not much fun. Nice idea but you cant really play with doll, daugher moved on after 2 days"
3,Well if you want to finish the reading..,"This book goes between the Empire era and Robot era(for there's no more robots in the Empire). This book worth to read for that reason. However as an individual book, it isn't very great book. The story is quite well planned and the consequences of this book go on and on on other empire books...and that's all for this book. This book doesn't have great mystery to solve or some great adventure - this book just shows what happened to the characters and places after the Robots of Dawn and how will it affect the future. This book is nothing but a finishing touch of Robot series. Nothing more."
3,The end of Robots and the beginning of the Empire,This novel marks the end of the detective stories and prepares the setting for the empire novels. It has a flavor of mistery but most of all it ties the story of Elijah Baley with the Empire and Foundation Universe. Great reading!
3,Good book. (for anyone but Asimov would rate excellent),"This is worth the reading, but sometimes it feels like Asimov remembered that he got paid by the page."
1,This book sucks.,"This is the worst Asimov book I've read. The idea that robots, which are supposed to operate on logic and reason, can reach such rediculous conclusions is disgusting. And to make matters worse, they turn out to be ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! I was rolling my eyes for half of this book.If you are already a fan of Asimov's books, then by all means buy this book. But make sure you've already read the entire robot series, or nothing in this book will make any sense. Although the plot ties the robot series with the empire and foundation books, I don't think it is a necessary read. The plot IMHO doesn't add much toward understanding the evolution of the empire."
3,Belt sanding,"These belts did not fit my belt sander, so my review will be based on that fact. They were a little pricey from my point of view."
2,A comment.,Just a note.NASA has to get it's budget approved each year...imagine what resources/cost that in itself takes not to mention the re-planning effort it takes when each budget is cut..When NASA had a 'unlimited' budget....they went from not having a manned presence in space to landing on the moon in less than 9 years.
1,Worthless without CDs,"The book is worthless without the Audio CDs that are needed for the exercises. If you do not have access to the TV program the books are even more worthless since the TV program is not available in the United States in any form.I know there are other places offering the Audio CDs and the Book together, that is the ONLY way you should buy this book."
4,Porter Cable Impact Wrench,Wrench works well. Construction is good. Little heavy (due to construction) but that may benefit in the long run.
3,OK.... but,"I've used this a few times now.PROs: Does what I want and appears to be very good quality. First one I've owned and I wish I'd bought an air wrench sooner -- very handy !CONS: Very noisy. Worse, the noise is a high-pitched scream. I'm tempted to use ear protection. I don't know if this is typical of air ratchets?"
3,I want to order,"Hello I want to interestng prices of some books. 1.""SME Mineral processing handbook"" volume 1,2 by N.L Weiss 2."" Introduction of mineral processing"" 3.""Gravity Concentratiuon Technology"" by Richard O. Burt 4.""Mineral Processing Technology"" 5 th edition by B.A.Wills Thanks"
2,most overrated group ever,"the ultimate group that was almost great; killer playing on bass, drums, and very trippy here and there. And the rest? drive-you-up-the-wall music hall [junk], and the constipated Steve Mariott (less then usual, thanks) warbling. In all fairness Ronnie Lane's insufferable cockney accent is even worse although it's easier to write his off. The songs are great in spots, but then they turn just kinda weak. These guys coulda been the sh't, but they fall short. And whatever anyone says, 'there are but 4 small faces' is much better."
5,Classic Edition of an All-time Favorite Game,"This ""up-graded"" version of Yahtzee is classically constructed and is a fun game that can be played by most. This version is excellently crafted to fit on a book shelf."
4,Worth the Money,"Although the dice are a bit cheap, the case is nice and sturdy. It should last longer than the cardboard box the regular version uses. I'd buy it again."
5,Kid's love it,"Part of a matching set of games for the whole family. Travels well, kids love it and we have plenty of fun."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I am the author of this book! When buying any EMS book, be sure that the edition you're looking at is UP TO DATE. This book is OUTDATED!"
4,You Might Love or Hate It,"While I'm not quite sure that it lived up to the hype that followed it, it certainly earned it. The story presented in this series is strong in how different it is. It's a slow moving, quiet, character drive period drama. Once you move past the differences and look at the series for what it is, you're still left with something above average.The characters and story are strong in their own ways. While the pacing and humor of the series will try the patience of everyone at some point, the romance and characters will keep you coming back. I can understand someone loving this series but I can also someone saying that they hated it. There is a middle ground though and even though I never found myself particularly attached to this series I was sad to see the first season end. I may not be counting down the days until I see the second season but I am at least left with wanting more."
1,this is a very bad movie,this is a very bad movie allthe good stuff is removed if you want the unrated version you have to buy this one my advice do not buy thismovie
3,"Fancy treats, but where's the nutrition?","This is a fun and creative little book, but what is lacking is any mention of what a cat needs in his diet to stay healthy. No mention of vitamins or a balance in the diet. Few of these recipes alone would provide a healthy steady diet. But its great fun for obsessive cat-pamperers and non-finicky cats."
4,Good Controller,"About the only thing bad I have to say about it is the buttons can sometimes feel a little ""sticky"" and don't snap like the standard SNES controller might. It can also be somewhat awkward to use on the floor if you don't have a desk or table to set it on. Besides that it's a decent controller for you fighting game enthusiasts who must have a joystick. I've had mine for 15+ years and it works just as well as it did when I bought it, but admittedly I only used it for Star Fox and a few Street Fighter 2 bouts. Overall, you could certainly do worse with an official Nintendo product from that era (like the Speedboard or the dreaded Power Glove) and this controller does provide some extra fun if you want to break away from the traditional controller."
5,"Awesome controller, funny button layout","Obviously Nintendo had the right idea when this controller was put on the market, although the button layout is something to be desired when you want to play some Street Fighter (or a Shoot-Em-Up, which I like to use it for). It's still a great piece of hardware and a neat addition to any SNES collection."
4,La Crosse Instrument,So far it is working well. I standardized it versus a standard thermometer and it's quite accurate. Would buy again.
3,Hygrometer Inconsistencies,"These units (2)operate very satisfactorily, but when compared with others, of the same or other brands, yield significantly different readings (as much as 15%) at lower humidity ranges. For household use, this is not a major problem, but could be a definite problem if accuracy is required."
1,BAD,"If you're looking for an accurate hygrometer, this isn't it! it was 15 points off when I tested it for accuracy!Amazon is taking back as defective so, i'm glad I bought it at Amazon."
4,Useful for any home,I bought this item to keep track of the humidity in my apartment because I have a number of wooden musical instruments. I has allowed me to keep pace with the humidity and know that I need to put moisture in the air to protect my instruments. Any one who has things sensetive to humidity would do well to purchase one of these.
2,Temperature is correct. Humidity is way off.,Humidity measurements are incorrect. It shows as much as 15% over my other Oregon Scientific weather station.
1,Failed in 6 months,I had high hopes for this drive. First it was noisy due to a cheap fan. Then today only 6 months after I ordered it - it failed - I lost 400GB of data most of which I had backed up because the drive wasn't acting right before. I'd stay away from this line. Get a seagate or maxtor or something that works.
5,Flawless performance,This drive is unbelievably quiet and was super-easy to install. I've had it about a year with no problems. Would buy another in a minute if I could afford it.
2,Boring performance,"I'm a big fan of UNKLE and I was quite disappointed by this CD: the mix is rather boring and uninspired.If you like James Lavelle or Unkle, you should try ""Do androids dream of electric beats?"", ""An UNKLE soundscape"" or ""Edit Music for a film"": those are much better remixes, with great beats and samples."
4,One of the best of 26,I own all 26 installments in this series (including the afterhours set by Deep Dish) and have to comment as this set being in the top 2. Not my favorite but immediately after throwing the first disc into my truck and driving across town I had people looking at me from bobbing my head to the sounds :) Recommended if you like the progressive breakbeat feal with a rock and roll edge.
5,The action figure finally has a mustache!,"I don't know about everyone else, but it used to really bug me that in most of the comics, on the cartoon, and everywhere else, Man-at-Arms had a mustache, but the figure was clean-shaven. Finally, they put the mustache on the action figure, so all versions can agree! The armor is basically the same as the classic version, only larger and more detailed. The mace is absolutely gargantuan, and an arm-mounted rocket launcher is included with the figure. He-Man's buddy is really decked out this time around."
1,BE CAREFUL........,"BE CAREFUL OF THIS ITEM. I THINK IT'S A BOOTLEG.I DON'T THINK THIS CONCERT HAS EVER BEEN RELEASED BY AEROSMITH. I HAVE THE BOOT AND THE QUALITY IS ABOUT 2 OUT OF 5. IF YOU WANT THIS SHOW, THERE ARE SEVERAL BOOT SITE YOU CAN BUY IT FROM FOR ALOT LESS.........."
1,incorrect size,"I ordered two of these ehaust tips from Auto Barn. There add states they will fit 1 1/2 exhaust, they will not fit a 1 1/2 exhaust. After getting return number and returning the tips to them thay refused to pay back shipping of $7.95 and return shipping of $8.68. There add also states they will pay shipping charges if they are at fault. So it cost me $16.63 to learn not to buy from Auto Barn."
3,"Ok, but others work better for me","I had high hopes for this, but really the wooden pediwands with the black paper work better for me. Those you can get at the grocery store or Target for pretty cheap. I was looking for an alternative because the black paper always peels off if left in the shower after a few weeks. But because they work so much better than this wand, I will stick with them. This is nice, but just wasn't very effective for me. Too bad."
3,Don't get this book used,"Don't get this book used, even if it is listed as ""Excellent"" or ""Good"" quality. It will come without the necklace, which is the most important part of the book. Spend your money on a new version where you will be sure to get the necklace."
4,Not as good as I thought it would be but still a good book,"Let me start out by saying I enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and it is nice to see strong black men in African American literature.Still I thought it was going to be better. The characters, male and female, were a bit unrealistic and at a few points in the book annoying. There seemed to be no grey lines in their outlook of situations around them. These characters were dealing with some farely deep issues yet I saw no depth in how they dealt with them. I would have liked to get more indepth into their personality and get a better view of who they were.Over all it was a good book. I enjoyed the story and the characters were likable. I enjoyed seeing this type of situation from the male side. It really made me think about the men I know in my life and how they would view this book and life in general. It really was a bit of an eye opening experience."
5,"The best since ""Men Cry in the Dark""","This is one of the best books that I have read since ""Men Cry in the Dark"" The authors way of portraying his characters was simply awesome!! Every chapter in the book flowed smoothly and kept you wanting more and more! I was quite sad at the outcome of Poppa Doc, he was such a likeable person and mentor through out the book, but at the same time the ending was real. 2 thumbs up to the author ""Travis Hunter"""
4,A Great Read!!,"This book was reviewed by The Between the Pages book club. It received 4 out of 5 stars. Mr. Hunter had well rounded characters that all my club members could relate to. It was refreshing to her a man's point of view that was sincere and real. The story showed how differently a man views what a relationship is compared to what a woman thinks. It also showed how men deal with fatherhood,and marriage on different levels. This was a great read and is recommened highly for a different perspective on life's issues. I will read ""Trouble Man"" to follow the lives of the Banks men."
4,Positive reading....,Awesome read. Traivs Hunter's first novel is an engaging read. What a nice change to see positive outlook from males. Poppa Doc was a jewel to everyone that he came in contact with. The characters were real and the issues of life were very realistic. Best wishes Travis. Stay Blessed.
4,A wonderful story about men,"This book shows how men can feel about love, responsibility and relationships. They do have a heart, though sometimes the ice has to be chipped from around it. I especially loved how Blake attached himself to Prodigy and made him his role model. And Poppa Doc, everybody knows one, he is full of wisdom, but its up to you to listen, heed, and follow good advice. Prodigy did, and things turned out well for him. The end was a real tearjerker, but each tear I shed was happy tears."
4,Very good but could use an update,"This is a fascinating topic, and this book does an excellent job of covering everything. The writing is quite good. Really the only sticking point is the level of detail. When this book was originally written, the technology probably wasn't there to include tables really easily, but tens of pages could be eliminated entirely if the data in this book were put into table or graphical format. I recommend the book, but be ready for a slow read."
4,The Factual Truth of the West Indies,"This book is, by far, one of the best comprehensive books on the West Indies and its inception. Mr. Williams tactfully pinpoints the disturbing but interesting truths of popular tourist rally-points such as; Barbados, Jamaica, Costa Rica, and Grand Cayman just to name a few. The slave trade and it's economic value, the prominence of sugar cane, and the injustices and insurrections illicited by the former, are all mentioned without bias in this book. A great read!!!!"
1,Poor Excuse for a Textbook,"I was assigned this book for my Carribean History Class. It is poorly writtin, and very difficult to follow along. The author jumps around from subject to subject, often times in the same paragraph, without any clear timeline or overall sense of what was happening at the time. The author will also use a number of terms in Spainish, or terms from history that are no longer used, without ever defining them for the reader.Furthermore, the book's bibliography is 42 pages long, yet it was copyrighted in 1970, 9 years into Eric Williams being Prime Minister of Trinidad. Where did he get the time to read so many sources.Basically, the book is poorly written by a man not qualified to write it, and I am ashamed of my professor for having assigned it."
5,Great Product,"I did a lot of research on cordless drills and everything pointed to Porter-Cable as the drill to buy. It has performed flawlessly. It has plenty of power to drill, and it is easy to swap out the bits really fast. I probably would have preferred the 14.4V, but I can honestly say that the 12V does the job. Mine also came with an excellent flashlight, and the dual batteries are a must. The 1 hour charge time is fantastic!"
3,Be Careful with the Batteries,"This is a super driver/ flashlight combo with the exception of two problems. The chuck is difficult to tighten on drill bits for the really tough jobs. And the batteries, if one should begin to leak (noticed by blue color on the contacts) had better be disposed of promptly. It will spread like cancer to the charger, then to the other battery and components. My entire system had to be disposed of due to a little blue color that I didn't think was a problem until too late."
2,Disappointed,"Having purchased other Porter Cable products in the past, I had high expectations for this tool. I previously worked with a Makita 9.6 volt unit and wanted to upgrade to a 12 volt product. After six months of fairly light use, my first unit broke at the stem beneath the keyless chuck (above the torque adjustment). A local retail outlet replaced the tool with a new unit, but the battery failed after a few months on the replacement unit. I have concerns about overall manufacturer quality, however, the tool does perform well."
3,Served me well...But,"Have owned this drill a while and worked fine for some time, no real problems, except for the batteries. After a year or so one became noticeably weaker and held a charge shorter then the other. Now neither will hold much of a charge. The drill seems well built and functions well but the batteries leave something to be desired. Two new batteries cost just 10$ less then a new drill. So in the market for a new one. Maybe a Lith Ion one."
1,Frustrated Porter Cable Fan,"I'm a contractor, and I've been a loyal Porter Cable customer for a long time. I own many P/C tools. I purchased this 12v drill as a replacement for a DeWalt 18v drill that I felt was too heavy and cumbersome for all-day use. Now I'm sorry I sold the DeWalt. This 12v has caused many frustrating moments on the job site...poor battery life, faulty keyless chuck (very annoying), and a 2-speed gear switch that sometimes slips into neutral if you're not careful where you grip the drill. I just can't recommend this drill, which is unfortunate for such a Porter Cable fan."
1,BUYER BEWEAR,i bought a used cable from him and asked him a bunch of questions and he said it was like brand new just no packaging when i got the vga cable it noticed right away that it was missing a pin on both sides of the cable to me he should not have sold it at all and or at least should have wrote that in his description to let people know thats what i get for trying to trust someone buying a used cable cause now im stuck with a cable that dosent work cause it will cost more to ship it back to get a refund not good business at all
3,very good product,"I am using this for Candida along with three-lac, I am definatleydetoxing as a result of both products!"
3,"A few good songs, one great one","I only bought this CD for the Mos Def/Sizzla song since I couldn't find it for download anywhere. Theres a couple of other good songs as well, but I was a bit disappointed with the rest of the tracks."
2,not 10000 hours,"i like the bulb except it does not last 10,000 hours. Should be expected from a product made in Thailand. Similar to made in China."
5,Perfect!,"I have always loved Baby Einstein products, especialy their soft books, they are great for young babies. When I saw my cousin's baby with this teether book I knew I had to buy it for my daughter. It is a book, a teether, a rattle, and an entertainment center all in one. It's great. When we go places, this is the one toy I always remember to bring along. It will keep my 4 month old busy no matter where we are. I highly recomend this book/teether/rattle... Now Baby Einstein makes toys too! I already ordered some of them from amazon and I can't wait to get them."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!,"Robert McCammon is a great writer. I read ""Gone South"" for the third time. It is a truly unique story-line that will hold your interest all the way through. I just ordered ""Boys Life"" and ""Swan Song"" which I will be reading for the third time each also."
3,"Big McCammon Fan~ Gone south, just ok","I have been a huge Robert McCammon fan ever since I read Swan Song many yrs ago. I just recently re-read gone south and I have to say that it was just ok.... McCammon does a great job in describing all characters and you really do feel you know them, but the end of the book was a little dissapointing, not to mention the whole ""Bright girl"" thing... Could have been better.."
4,Good Enough,"I read McCammon's ""Swan Song"" years ago and I loved it. This book is not anywhere near as good, but a decent read nonetheless. I rarely read fiction nowadays. Only Michael Crichton, Mario Puzo, and occasionally John Grisham can interest me in fiction anymore. I bought ""Gone South"" years ago and it's just been sitting around waiting to be read.So, even though I don't read much fiction, I did enjoy this book. It kept me interested. And that, after all, is one of the reasons to read."
4,"Not the best McCammon has ever written,","but it's certainly not bad. It's sort of a circus freaks chase the over stressed veteran story, it's worth reading even if it's a little campy. McCammon is a great writer and this is a must have if your a fan of his, but not a must have if you're just a broad based reader."
2,Not up to par,"McCammon's characters begin fairly well developed, although they all seem mostly defined by their various maladies/deformities. Once the protaganist is surrounded by the other characters, any meaningful inner dialogue seems to diappear, and the story plays itself out to a predictable, redemptive ending. The bounty hunters sailing off together is a bit trite."
5,"Clever, funny, and entertaining","McCammon's last novel before he took a decade long hiatus is a must read for anyone that likes suspense books and has a sense of humor. This book is really funny in parts! The cast of characters are unique to say the least, including a guy who has a deformed twin brother growing out the side of his ribcage and an Elvis Presley impersonator. Certainly the lightest of all of McCammon's efforts, this book is an incredibly fun read.I rank this book among all my personal McCammon favorites like Mine, Swan Song, Boys Life, and Speaks the Nightbird."
4,"A nice, good read.","Gone South is a moralistic novel. About faith and redemption, and in some parts (especially concerning Flint and Eisley) prejudice. It's not up to par, to say the truth with great novels like Swan Song and Boy's Life, but then again, it's always a cumbersome task to deliver such fantastic reads like those. Yet, its an enjoyable novel, and well recommended for McCammon fans. Especially the new batch of them, like me."
4,Very good book!!!!!!,Gone South has the action of Boy's Life and the depression of Usher's Passing!It was the second book i read by Robert McCammon.(Boy's Life was the first).I think anyone should read this for it's action and excitement!Gone South grabs you by the throat and keeps grabbing.A really good book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Not bad, but not great","I loved Leah Rewolinski's send-up of the Star Trek universe when I was in high school. I recently came across the books again and tried re-reading them for the first time in over a decade. Still kinda funny, but it seems clear in retrospect this first book was adapted from a failed screenplay -- there are a plethora of sight gags and lines that would be funny visually, but not so much in a book. It's interesting mainly as a curiosity for real Trek fans. If you find it cheap at a used book sale it'd be worth giving a look."
2,Don't bother beaming this one up,"Taking shots at classic Star Trek & the Next Generation, `Star Wreck' reads somewhat like a genre parody in the spirit of `Airplane!' and `The Naked Gun'. Plenty of sight-gags and dry one-liners abound here. Unfortunately, the quality of the humor is more on par with `Police Academy'- a fair deal of it falls flat, or is just plain dumb.If you're looking for decent sci-fi parody, rent `Spaceballs' or `GalaxyQuest' on video, or dredge up the MAD Star Trek Special mag at your local comic books & collectibles shop. Heck, even `Star Wars Episode I' grabs more laughs (especially when Jar Jar isn't in the scene) than this ridiculous little tome!`Late"
1,"Not terribly funny; in fact, a real yawner","The authors attempt here to parody not only the original Star Trek series, but ""The Next Generation"" as well. Both of these successful (and high quality) series are very deserving of satire, and have certainly received their share over the years.Star Wreck tries to follow in these footsteps, and falls flat. The jokes generate mild chuckles at best, but more often groans and even whimpers. The book, and its weak, lame, tepid humor, is easily flipped through in 15 minutes, then forgotten forever."
4,"Boomy, but not precise","Ok, I used to have one of these subs and it doesn't hit as precise as I remember. It could be the difference in car size or even sub size (old one might have been an 8"") but whatever the reason it just doesn't sound the same.It sounds good, don't get me wrong - I was just expecting something a little more quick in how it responds.I have a 4x50w amp powering this sub, the two rear channels (3 and 4) are bridged going to this and it hits hard. A lot harder than I thought it was going to, honestly. My installer put 42sq/ft of Dynamat in my Hyundai Accent in order to keep the vibrations down. I honestly can't turn the stereo up more than halfway or my ears start to bleed. I had it turned up loud (once) just to see what it was like and the whole car shook. This Bazooka Tube hits HARD with the right amount of juice going to it."
3,"A musical stop-gap between ""Tiger Bay"" and ""Good Humor""","""Continental"" contains a couple of gems, notably the ballads ""Sometimes In Winter"" and ""Lonesome"" but only half the tracks are unavailable elswhere. It is basically a collection of b-sides and rarities which is only worth a listen for the Saint Etienne completist. There is nothing on this album to compare to anything from ""Good Humor"" or ""Tiger Bay"". However, I would recommend it as an odds 'n' sods package which makes, for want of a better description, ""pleasant"" listening. ""Places To Visit"" is a more interesting CD to buy."
5,TIME WELL SPENT,"This movie is magical - inspired by a book that reflected the spirit of the 70s: the search for meaning. Although the message of Peaceful Warrior is the movie's strong point, it is matched by the superb acting, direction, and cinematography. This is the kind of movie that, depending on your personal evolution, may have a profound impact on how you approach the rest of your life."
5,Great movie,"Peaceful Warrior is a great motivational and inspirational movie. Hope for anyone with injuries. Peaceful Warrior doesn't give up, keeps an eye on the future. Nike Nolte gives a great performance; one of his best - and gives the needed push and support to the athlete. The message being: Warriors don't give up. Written from a true story. Enjoyed the movie."
5,Excellent Movie - true to the book,"Really enjoyed this movie, as a big fan of Celestine Prophecy it lived up to my expectations."
2,Product Quality,"The video itself is amazing and highly recommended, however I was very disappointed with the product quality.The sound of the movie is about 30 seconds before the images all the way through the movie and find this not acceptable.You see the images of a conversation or other actions 30 seconds after you hear the sames conversations or actions."
3,Peaceful Warrior,I enjoyed the movie but did not feel it captured the total feel of the book. Which happens when you make a movie about such an intense subject.
2,Horrible Acting from all actors,I had read the book and was anxious to see the movie. The acting was just horrible and watched liked a low B grade movie. It would appear that looking at the ratings that I am in the minority but I think that the book is a hundred times better... YMMV
4,"Way of the ""Peaceful Warrior""","Great movie.Unfortunately, this version was ""cut-down short in its prime.""Very true to the book, but not to the story itself.This movie does however; catch a small portion of the essence of the book.Although, the movie is well played out, it just doesn't catch up to its full potential & therefore, doesn't qualify for being an all time great.I am an admirer of the author & his work, & I highly recommend his books to my students, patients & friends.I also highly recommend the movie; see it for yourself & you decide what this movie might do for you?Senseimfs"
1,Read the book and forget this movie rip off,The movie version started well enough but having read the book and enjoyed it I was very disappointed in this movie within about 15 minutes of the start.It does not really follow the book except in a very few scenes and if I had seen the movie first I would never have read the book. Fortunately I read the book first which I really liked but this is a very poor adaptation and not worth the money spent.I hope one day they make a movie that follows the story but this is not it
2,I pass,"Poorly done, Granted there are some almost profound ""statements"" in this movie, but personally I would rather read the book."
5,We truly are our worst enemy.,"To quote Don Henley, ""what the head makes cloudy, the heart makes very clear."" This movie helped me become more aware of how my logical, rational (but mostly irrational) thinking can handcuff me from executing on my deep desires. The journey is chosing what to listen to and believe about ourselves."
4,an uplifting movie,Its a shame this movie did not get a wider release. It's a movie the whole family can enjoy.
3,Good story line,This was a good story of how one person struggles for discipline in training for the Olympics and competitions.
1,I'd like 2 hours wasted hours of my life back,"The comparison between Rocky and this movie is unwarranted. The main character in this movie is not as relatable or a good role model as the Rocky character. Instead, he is a very bratty, mean spirited, closed minded individual, even towards the person that helps him on his journey ""Socrates."" The characters are not very realistic for positive transformation to happen to and not much about this movie is great or inspirational. It was a horrible experience to sit through this hoping it would get better. Its your risk if you want to waste a few hours of your life."
1,Frat Boy and Stoned Yoda Eat Veggies,This movie is horrible. I had a hard time keeping my mouth shut while watching it. Basically an injured frat boy meets a stoned yoda and they eat vegetarian cuisine and talk in circles. The injured frat boy is irritating and unconvincing and Nick Nolte is... well .... stoned. Skip this one. If you want to watch something truly inspirational watch Enter Dragon the Bruce Lee story or you'll even be better off with Sling Blade.
2,ALL I GOT FROM THE MOVIE It's all about the journey.,"Paradox- life is not meant to be understood. Humor- how one. maintain one especially about yourself. Change- life is always changing, be part of it."
1,Eastern religion re-packaged for Western consumption,"While it was nice to see Nick Nolte working in front of a camera again instead of speeding down the highway blitzed out of his mind on drugs. And equally as nice to see Amy Smart acting more civilized this time. This movie, while fun to watch was nothing more than a load of Eastern religious ""Self Realization"" teachings presented in a way to be palatable to the Western mind. I didn't like it.If you are into Buddhism and New Age religions. You'll probably eat this up. Otherwise it's the same old New Age agenda laden, anti-Christian Schlock."
3,Nice Sports Performing,"So, what is all about?If one is unhappy ""to live on less"", this person should find and follow a spiritual guru inspiring him doing so till hard working changes a life for a better, and legless sportsman to win a top prize!Maybe, it is an applauded American reality as more recent government stimulus worked helpfully anyway."
2,Not Exactly What I Was Expecting,"Didn't keep my interest. The lessons taught by the teacher seemed basic. If a person watched this film without already understanding the understandings the kid comes to it could be life changing, although the film itself is not very inspiring. When I think of an inspiring film I think ""Gladiator."" Many scenes were very over dramatized and the kid was often ignorant and egotistical.It could act as a doorway to spiritual enlightenment?! but beyond that there is nothing more."
1,Skip It and Get the Book,"I won't waste your time with a lengthy review, as others have already done that. I will just say three things :1) The book was great, and really can change your life. The movie was a huge disappointment.2) Nick Nolte was a poor choice for Socrates, and did a lousy job of portraying a very special character.3) This film is not uplifting, or wise, or thought-provoking, or funny. It is one to pass over.I've read all but one of Dan's books, including reading 'Way of the Peaceful Warrior' more times than I can count over the last 20 years. I don't know whether Socrates was real, or what Dan is like as a person, or whether he sold out. Really, I don't think any of that matters if you get something useful from the experience. Someone who comes to the Peaceful Warrior world through this film will probably turn around and walk away. Too bad."
4,inspirational video,Peaceful Warrior is a story that while inspiring is also very entertaining. There is a fantasy aspect to the video that is quite compelling; so the story does not become stale or just the same old story. very enjoyable!
5,An excellent taste of Dan,"I thought this movie was a fine translation, not so much of the book The Peaceful Warrior, but of what Dan Millman thinks and teaches. On the one hand, I enjoyed it as a Hollywood movie, but as a move per se I would probably have only given it 4 stars. But as a student and friend of Dan, I definitely think this is a 5 star experience. The acting was very good; the special effects were fabulous; and the story was moving and motivating.The bottom line is that Dan is a great teacher about life, and by watching this movie I feel spiritually reaffirmed and reemboldened.Bottom line: I'm really glad I watched this, and would recommend this heartily."
3,Read the book first,I think they lost a lot of the power of the book - although you can't put it all into a film it lost a lot of the lessons from the book. It is probably best as a companion to the book than on it's own.
4,Presence,"Peaceful Warrior above all has a message the world sorely needs to hear. The message is primarily about living in the present moment. All too often we are stuck dwelling in the past, or overly anxious about the future, missing out on the only real moment there is. This film presents this truth and others in a well structured entertaining way. Oh sure, it's no Lethal Weapon with a bang a minute. But what made it so fantastic was that it really happened. It was nice to see the transformation of a young man so lost grow into a spiritual leader ""paying it forward"" so to speak for, hopefully, generations to come."
2,Disappointing,"I saw a trailer for this movie, and thought it would be another inspiring tale of one person's successful struggle over adversity. It is.But the whole Nick Nolte zen master character (Socrates) was poorly executed, in my opinion. I get the ambiguity of his character (internal dream or real person, etc.) but I just thought it ended up being a distraction. Which is bad, given that it's probably 60% of the movie!Rent it if you're curious, but just go in with low expectations. Maybe you'll like it more than I did."
3,The book is much better,"I was a huge fan of the Dan Gillman book,Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives. The movie was entertaining but didn't do the book justice. Nick Nolte wasn't a great choice as Socrates. They should have selected someone much thinner and in better shape. I did like the gymnast they selected to play Dan. They didn't follow the book very closely and left out huge segments. I was wavering between a 3 star and 4 star rating since I enjoyed seeing the book brought to life. If I could select 3.5, that would be my rating. Its worth a watch for a low-cost rental but don't recommend that you purchase the movie."
4,THE PEACEFUL REVIEWER,"WELL FIRST OF ALL DVD WORKED OK OVER HERE IN THE U.K., THATS A PLUS.FILM AND BOOK, WELL THE BOOK SEEMED TO INCLUDE A LOT MORE PHILOSOPHICAL TEACHING THAN THE FILM PRODUCED, SO A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING.CONSIDERING THE BOOK OF THE FILM WAS THE START OF A ""JOURNEY"" WHICH YOU DISCOVER IN THE SEQUEL TO THE PEACEFUL WARRIOR I WAS SURPRISED THAT THE ""ESOTERIC MEANING"" BEHIND THE FILM WAS NOT MADE PLAINER.NICK NOLTE DID NOT REALLY DO IT FOR ME AS ""SOCRATES"".WHEN I READ THE BOOK I PICTURED A CHARACTER LIKE DON JUAN MATUS IN CASTANEDAS WORKS, A GRIZZLED OLD-TIMER, WITH A CERTAIN ECCENTRICITY,MAYBE AN OLD INDIAN, OR A JACK PALANCE TYPE-CHARACTER,THE ""SOMETHING-NOT-QUITE-RIGHT"" INDIVIDUAL.NOLTE WAS TOO CLEAN,ESPECIALLY FOR A GARAGE MECHANICS,COME ON HE HAD A CLIPPED BEARD AND OVERALLS THAT HAD NEVER SEEN OIL,A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR TRYING TO USE A SPANNER, SORRY! VINCE VEGAS."
3,Peaceful Warrior,This was recommended to me by a friend when I asked what to get for another friend. Never did hear from the recepient. Hmmm.....so really have no clue if he liked it or not.
5,Presence,"Peaceful Warrior above all has a message the world sorely needs to hear. The message is primarily about living in the present moment. All too often we are stuck dwelling in the past, or overly anxious about the future, missing out on the only real moment there is.This film presents this truth and others in a well structured entertaining way. Oh sure, it's no Lethal Weapon with a bang a minute. But what made it so fantastic was that it really happened. It was nice to see the transformation of a young man so lost grow into a spiritual leader ""paying it forward"" so to speak, for hopefully, generations to come."
5,"The ""Heroic Winged Warrior"" returns!","Stratos was one of the first Masters of the Universe figures I got back in '82, and I'm happy to see that he's been included as one of the premier figures in the launch of the new line. He still has the jet pack (I never understood why a guy with wings needed a jet pack to be able to fly), only now, it fires rockets as well. The wings are mounted slightly differently on his arms, but it looks cooler than before. The head is almost identical, while the body is a bit leaner than before. All in all, the redesigned Stratos has a nice look, and you could do a lot worse than to pick one up if the opportunity presents itself."
5,Stratos can fly!,"Stratos is unique to me because he was one of the only classic characters I never had when I was a kid. So it's extra special that he came out again so now I can undo that horrible mistake. Stratos has wings and an awesome jet-pack (that's how he flies!). One thing very original about the Masters of the Universe line was how colorful and different the characters were and Stratos is a perfect example of that. I always anticipated his rare appearances on the cartoon and now I can relive those moments with this awesome action figure! I hope the cartoon comes out on DVD which would be a great companion to the new figure line. Masters of the Universe was one of the most creative figure lines ever and one of several in the 1980's. It's great that Stratos and the other classic characters are back and looking even cooler than before. Fly Stratos, Fly!"
1,Still waiting for my Action Figure,I've been waiting over 4 weeks for my Action Figure to show up and I'm still waiting. This is the 1st time I have ever order from Amazon and I don't think I will ever order again!!! So I can't tell you how fun the toy is because I still don't have it.
3,"Heavy, Great Vocals, Good but not great...","Lead singer Mandy Lion has always provided excellent vocals, and there are some good songs on this album, but it does not stand out as one of the greats in heavy metal.I would recommend this album to metal heads and I am still happy to add it to my collection."
2,Mediocre at best.,"The unimaginative riffs and mediocre production paired with Mandy Lions overrated voice make for an album that is not indicative of the musicians talent. The songs drone together with few stand out sections. After the first few tracks, the album became monotonous to the point I had to take it out of the disk player. WWIII - ""When God Turned Away"" is best taken in small doses."
5,A great book!,"This small book is simply adorable, funny and full of imagination. I found a close-out copy of it at a local bookstore and almost didn't buy it. Now I am very glad that I did!"
3,A glimpse at most,"This book does have some beautiful portraits, but the information in the book is brief and doesn't go into much detail. It gives a glimpse of what to expect without ant details. McDonalds are great and successful, but this book doesn't match with their knowledge."
1,Ed wood films beat the crap out of this amateur stuff.,"Ive seen bad films, but this one takes the cake,,, unfunny, amateurish, boring and stupid actors.Looks like they wanted to make a bad movie like they used to makein the 50's....and failed.Shot in black and white with the gore and cheap sex scence in color.Even if they were shot in 3d it would not save the film.Please give me real moviemakers and send these low grade crappy actors/directors into the sunset....This film makes the Toxic Avenger series look good......."
5,13 Rockin' songs!,This band comes hard and heavy with 13 heavy duty rockers. Here is a list of the songs:1- Feels Like2- Trapped3- Nature of the Game4- Without a net5- Fool to Believe6- Urban Mama7- Someday's getting better8- Nothing's forever9- Night of Mights10- Changes11- Invasion Of Light12- Hell on Earth13-BONUS TRACK: Wake Me Up.
2,Not that great,It's okay; doesn't sound much like Squidward though. I probably wound not have purchased it if I knew how it sounds.
5,Porter-Cable Drill,"Delivered on time and item was what they said it was. I already have one on these drills but it quit on me. This one is working fine, except on the charger it seems to have a smell like it is getting hot. The charger is hot also. My other charger for my other drill does not get hot. I'll try it a little longer and if it stays this way I will look at replacing it. But all in all no problems."
4,A wickedly funny satire.,"Award winning journalist Dale Douglas Mills skewers America's favorite obsessions and compulsions in a wickedly funny look into the near future. Her story about red, white and blue Americn leaders and things military, medical, religious and political is drenched in satire."
5,Sizzling Satire,"A sizzling spoof of presidents, politics and war, with society's favorite conflicts from abortion to religion to medical care thrown in. Funny and serious. outrageous and rewarding."
1,Wasn't 360 Black,"I have been wearing Perry Ellis 360 Black for 6 years and this isn't 360 Black that was delievered to me, it's either a knock off or the wrong spray. It kinda smells and look like the 360 Pearl. I am not happy and I bought 2 bottles of this!"
4,Great smell,I get very good compliments on this but it is very unfortunate that it fades after about 3 hours but if your just going on dates and don't care to impress all day at work this is a great price and will last you quite a while assuming you don't bathe in it
3,"Good Fregrance, but don't like spray","This Perry Ellis has a nice fregrance, but since it is a spray it makes it difficult to control the amount that is being applied."
2,marginal at best,"Got it for office use. Its sound quality at medium to higher volumes is marginal. And it's lowest volume (""1"" setting)is too high for office use. Not too happy with this product."
1,Very annoying background buzz,"Very annoying background hum/buzz that comes from the unit, not the receiver. Others have commented on this, and it seems that this is a very basic engineering problem XM could have taken care of during design, but seems they'd rather rush out a piece of crap. Too bad there are no other real options out there for the office-- I have the box right next to me at my desk, so I can't turn up the volume enough to drown out the noise.Save your money for the next generation of boxes- I wish I had."
1,Not pleased,"The first one did not work, (why wasn't it tested before being sent out)?They sent another box that looked like it had been sitting in a garage for a couple of years, (dirty and dented) but it worked. I paid for a new box and received a used product. Too much hastle to send back. I will never order from them again."
4,"Good product, easy to use","The sound quality is not excellent, but this could be due to a poor reception because of location restraints. Overall the stereo makes it easy to transplant the XM receiver from the car to the home, which was most important to me."
2,Digital Hype!,"I keep reading reviews and articles about XM having near CD quality sound.It simply is not true.Out of all the formats I have heard which include; SACD,CD,Minidisc,Cassette,VHS and FM,the SkyFi has got to be the least natural sounding.It has too many digital artifacts which make it unlistenable for any extended period of time.The concept is great but the audio quality is another step backwards for digital sound."
1,"Yep, there's a noise...","After reading the reviews here and elsewhere I decided to roll the dice and hope for a boombox that didn't have the background noise. My gamble failed. As others have said, the noise can be heard at low to medium volume settings (which are likely the settings you'll be using in an office environment.)I promptly exchanged the unit for an Audiophase XM Skybox and I couldn't be happier.I love XM, but this product should be skipped for something better (such as the aforementioned Audiophase)."
2,"High pitched whine, defective design","Don't buy one of these until they fix what must be a design flaw. As others have noted, there is a high pitched whine audible whenever the box is switched on. It's there regardless of whether any music is playing or not. This is almost certainly a design flaw. It could be aliasing noise, a leaky carrier tone, etc.XM is an interesting concept, but this boombox is poorly implemented."
2,Not great for indoor use,"Purchased XM because radio stations in my area are poor, and wanted Fox Sports Radio. Unit works good outdoors as long as the antenna is facing South. Indoors, they are not kidding when they say the antenna must be in a South-facing clear glass window. Having to keep the antenna facing South can also cause some portability issues. Also, would have liked to use at the office. No chance. My cubicle has no South-facing windows, so I also have no XM at work."
1,No Reception,"I purchased this to use at the office. I am unable to get the receiver to work. Being at a south facing window is not sufficient enough in the building to get the reception, and I can not mount it outdoors.Just a note of caution....we made sure we purchased our boombox from a place with no-questions-asked return policy. There are indoor situations where this will not work and you may need to return it!I'm just dissappointed that I can't have my XM while I work!"
4,Good experience,"I purchased a new Delphi SA1001 XM Boombox on Amazon and it was a great experience; the radio arrived on time and in great shape in time for my out of country vacation. It is great to be lying on a beach in the Carribbean, or crusing the backroads of Mexio with the best programmed and range of music in the world on your boombox."
5,Satellite Radio Speaker Dock,"I had been looking for a speaker dock for my satellite radios, but my radios were too old and there were no speaker docks available until I found a used one. I purchased it and it works like a champ. I'm very happy that I found one available at Amazon.com."
2,Sound quality too weak...,"I tried this particular Boom-Box some time back, and ended up returning it under my retailer's fairly generous return policy. Simply put, the service and the SkyFi were not bad (although I have a similar review posted on my experience with SkyFi tuning knobs), and I enjoyed both XM and the SkyFi immensely. Simply, this unit is certainly portable, but if you take it outdoors you probably won't hear it because the volume is so weak and limited. It's 4W per channel, so you're not going to hear much at full volume. Otherwise, it isn't a bad unit but without output, you're left to wonder."
2,XM Boom Box,"I got this for my husband for Christmas, and it still isn't working. He wanted it to listen to baseball games on the XM in our bedroom. Well he's made every attempt to put the antenna in the right area outside of our house and we still can't get any reception. He finally had to order another $50 antenna from XM. Hopefully this will make it work!"
1,I Have My Doubts,"I looked forward to getting this product, but I was unable to get it to work.First, I had trouble getting a signal, even after much frustrating effort, even with an unobstructed view of the southern sky.Then, I couldn't get the machine to stay on, it kept shutting down.I would be willing to try another one."
3,Its ok if its what youve got...,"When I first got this boombox I was a little disappointed. It works fine for what it is but there is not much in the way of any controls to improve the sound. Actually all there is, is a volume knob thats a bit small & not very precise. You can go from quiet to loud in a fraction of movement. Theres no tone control at all so its a bit flat. The covering for the speakers is sort of flimsy so dont look at it too hard or it may shred.You have to take the battery cover off to plug in the anttenae & to get the XM unit out you ( or I do anyway ) have to push down & in just right on the top portion of the radio unit to make it release.Overall, if you get it for a good price, I mean a really good price, & you dont expect too much then its certainly usefull.I have a Roady XT also that I use with an old Lenoxx Sound AM/FM radio cassette player that works much better with the FM transmitter than the Delphi & boombox combo..."
2,You get what you pay for...,"The unit interfaces well with the Delphi XM receiver, but does not provide good sound quality. It sounds like a cheap radio because that's what it is. The speakers are cheap. The casing is cheaply made and my unit did not work with batteries as promised. The design is great, but the sound quality is very poor.If you're thinking about getting one because you ALREADY have a Delphi XM Radio receiver, then it's not a bad investment. But you may want to wait and see what the future holds because surely the XM Radio folks are going to provide us more quality units to listen to their great broadcasts."
2,Annoyances outweigh the positives,"As others have noted:PROS:Decent sound, long antenna cord (20'), compact design, clean aesthetics.CONS:Flimsy volume control, antenna can't be attached without removing the battery compartment cover, and VERY ANNOYING high pitched hum that makes you think you're listening to AM radio. Unless you are willing to put up with this and need the portability, you're better off buying a home adpater and running the receiver through your home audio setup."
1,Hissing noise,Please do not waste your money. The hissing noise from the boombox makes listening to your XMSR unbearable.
3,What can you do when you have no other choice,"I recently decided to switch from Sirius to XM. I loved my Sirius Audiovox boombox, so I knew that I wanted another boombox for listening to XM. I knew immediately upon taking this product from the box that the quality of the Delphi could not compare to the Audiovox. ""What can you do if you have no other choice."" I guess if I had not owned an Audiovox boombox, I would not have noticed a difference.Pro: I like that the antenna cable is hidden.LightCon: Bad handle design, person with large hand couldhave trouble carrying."
3,Classic Ring,Happy to find this classic device. Used it in a play. I'm glad it's still around for people who ride bikes or people who do sound effects for plays.
5,Great Cabinet for the price,"This is a great cabinet for the price. It does have a carboard back, but I really didn't expect anything else. My husband put it together and he had no problem putting it together. It took him about 30 minutes. I do not have it attached to the wall and it seems to be sturdy. The base keeps it from falling forward. I have it on a tile floor, so it might not be as sturdy on a rug. I would recommend this cabinet if you are looking for something cheap to hold your collection that looks good.Carol"
2,Book #3,"Out of the three books in this series, this was my least favorite. I thought it was very unrealistic, and I didn't care for the story line about a 16 year old girl getting seriously involved in a romantic relationship so quickly. It seemed to promote that that is a good idea."
1,Very disappointing,"The book is outdated as far as current policies on international adoption. There are better books out there about this.This couple has such a bad marriage that they should not have adopted. She took a huge risk of adopting with the hope that her husband would come around once the baby was born. If he hadn't, the baby would have experienced the loss of her birth parents and the loss of the adoptive father. The author was arrogant and selfish.The fighting between the author and she husband should have been left in her journal."
1,Disturbing,"I am so glad I got this book from the library and didn't buy it. This is all about Jill wanting a babeeeeee at any cost. Her husband clearly did not want a child, a Chinese one at that, so it became about Jill getting her way. It'll be interesting to see how things turn out-- especially since Joe did not want to keep her Chinese name and was worried about her hair color. (Sheesh!)Overall, the book depicted negative sterotypes about selfish adoptive parents. Not all adoptive parents are like this couple!!"
4,A Link to a Tragic Dilemma,"This is a tender, poignant exploration of Jill and Joe's long and often harrowing journey to parenthood. Because our children are faced with a similar predicament, it is even more touching to me. This couple's story opened doors of understanding at a feeling level that I otherwise could only have known intellectually."
1,A study in narcissism and dysfunctional marriage,"I read this book some time ago, and I was simply floored by the author's unabashed self-absorption and self-pity. Jill Smolowe's immaturity and naricssism are only outdone by her husband's ... they are truly meant for each other! I do feel sorry for the author's little girl, who was ultimately adopted from China ... The author's marriage is highly dysfunctional, and it seems all but certain that Becky will grow up with only one parent. The chapters on the author's trip to China were mildly interesting and informative, and were the best part of this otherwise disappointing book. Jill Smolowe and her husband come across as loathsome and utterly selfish, and I wonder how in the world they ever were able to convince a social worker to approve their homestudy."
1,Ugh!,"I agree with the reviewer who found this couple ""loathsome and selfish."" I am also struggling with infertility, and hoped to find some words of wisdom in this book. What I got was a picture of a marriage that the husband clearly didn't want to be in and that seemed incredibly dysfunctional. I admire Ms. Smolowe's honesty, but she clearly planned to bring a child into a marriage with an ""absentee live-in father."" Why? I was also never fully convinced that she really wanted a baby, as opposed to feeling obligated to ""have it all."" I was happy to see that it all seemed to work out in the end (the ""baby-saves-marriage"" theme) but I wonder if there isn't more to the story. It was most helpful and inspiring when she stuck to their attempts to make the adoption decisions, but the marriage was so troubling that I questioned the author's sense of responsibility."
1,poor customer service,"The item itself was frayed around the knee area. In addition, the brace is not the one that the orthopedic doctor wants me to use. I emailed the company twice to get a return authorization and to date they have not answered."
1,Ankle Brace,"I was extremely disappointed with these. Although they fit surprisingly well, they (I bought 2) didn't stay up. They kept sliding down making them useless."
2,NOT impressed!,"The fit on this was ALL WRONG! I am 5'2"", and this, even in size 3X didn't fit right. The metal hinges dug into my thighs, and the part where I needed the support, THE KNEE, it wasn't even tight. I was very disappointed."
4,"OTC ORTHOTEX Knee Stabilizer with Hinged Bars, Black, 2X-large","Bought a 2x size from Amazon and it was a bit too large to stay up. Sent it out back today and will order a xlarge size instead. Overall , good quality and sturdy design (metallic joints on the sides to avoid lateral movement).Felt comfortable when on (though for a few minutes only)."
3,Does the job,"I have big thighs and calfs, no im not over weight, so it was kind of snug up top and bottom, it does however do what it is meant to do, I have a hard time running without support. THis made me feel like i did before my surgery almost 10years ago. The hinges help with the pressure of every bounce."
4,Knee Brace,I bought a prescription one for $130 and this one is better. Wish I had known about it before I spent all that money.
2,Slips and Slides,"I measured my knee twice, both sitting and standing, before ordering and ordered the size best for the measurements. When it arrived I tried the brace on sitting down and it fit well and offered the support I needed. Upon standing however, it was a different story. After about five steps it was halfway down my leg, after six more it was at my ankle. I tightened it as much as possible and it still wouldn't stay up. This went on for three days as I tried to figure out a way to make it work since my knee felt better while it was on. But nothing worked and I returned it and will continue looking for a knee brace."
2,Return policy,Nowhere in the description of the item did it say there was a no return policy if you had opened or tried on the item. Very disappointed.
1,disapointed,i'm tryng to locate the receipt so I can return it. It does not have the straps to go around the brace.
3,SO-SO,"I was so excited to find a book like this when I saw it, it sounded great and I dove right in when I got it. What the hell was this woman thinking? I couldn't imagine putting up with some of the stuff she did. The most common solution was this: get used to it. Um, no thank you. I don't have to get used to being treated like crap. I did glean some helpful things about basics (like finances) that I hadn't thought of before and was very happy I brought it up after reading about it. I'm off to find the bigger better book on this subject. I'm not about the cutesy ""sassy stepmom"" stuff and it is quite clear this woman knew NOTHING about children when she started dating a guy with them."
5,Great laughs and some honest truths,"This book is great for anyone who is or is becoming a stepmom. While there is no instruction guide for stepparenting, this book helps to put things into perspective and allows you to laugh along the way."
5,Very helpful,I am in a relationship with a man who has been divorced for only 2 years and has a 6 year old daughter part-time. Recently I have been having a hard time dealing with his constant communication with his ex-wife and his daughter really pushing my buttons. I guess getting into the relationship I didn't think it would be this hard for me....but I was wrong. It's been a year and I was thinking to myself that I either jump ship or make the commitment to stick this out. He is a wonderful man and is very loving when we are alone. But add in the ex factor and that all changes.This book was very helpful for me to see all sides of the relationship and learn how to deal with these feelings. It was nice to know that I am not a jealous over-protective girlfriend....I just don't think my boyfriend should be catering to his ex's needs. If you need some advice or have any doubts....READ THIS BOOK! Wonderful.
1,Pass. There are far more insightful books to be read.,"It was mildly entertaining at times, but this book was pretty limited in actual helpful information. Written in a cutesy style with ""sassy stepmother straight scoop"" recaps of already simplistic ideas, I motored through this book in an afternoon, and didn't learn anything new. I've read several other stepmother guides since, and every one of them was more useful, informative, and better written."
4,Single Girl's Guide,This is such a great book. I am about to become a stepmother and this book had me laughing and smiling and made it seem like I could make it. I have read it twice already and figure I will be reading it many more times to come!
5,"Sassy, Funny, Refreshing","So, I'm not the only one having these experiences! It's nice to know there are others out there who have some of these same feelings. Sally's book had me laughing hysterically at some of the things she'd been through, and many of her tips are useful. It's a fresh look at step-motherhood from a hip, sassy author who seems to take her life and role as step-mother and mother in stride. If you're looking for a step-parenting psychology 101 textbook, this may not be the book for you. But if you want a fun, humorous look at what's in store on your new journey with your step-family, sit back, relax and enjoy."
5,What To Expect When You're... Becoming a Stepmom,"This book can be difficult to read because it pulls no punches. It doesn't spare your feelings or sugar-coat how difficult the role of stepmom is. That is why I love it. It made me feel like a superwoman for taking this on, affirmed my feeling that wow, it was *really* hard, and reminded me that I am not alone. Being a stepmom is amazing and wonderful, of course, but it has challenges and pitfalls unlike any other role, and frankly, most people dismiss that fact by saying ""Well, that's what you chose when you got involved with a divorced guy."" Yeah? Well, I still need to vent, just like biological moms, so give me some support, sista! This book is where I found a lot of solace. I could have done without the ten zillion Carrie Bradshaw-esque asides, but that's a minor quibble; the meat of the book will really fill that gaping maw in your emotional stepmommy tummmy."
1,"If I knew that, I would not have....","I have not read this book yet... And I am gonna to buy it now.... But if I knew that I have to face with all of the hardship of being a stepmother like I do now, I would never have married him... Love only is so far away to be enough to marry a single dad with dependent kids...especially when he is not a discipline dad..."
1,Eeeww....a case of TMI,"My friend enjoyed this book and thought I might as well, despite the fact I'm not a member of the step-parent club. I didn't. The author is willing to portray herself as self-absorbed and a big cry-baby who, having suffered through a rather non-existent sex life finally finds a man....but why would she want him if she is as popular and high-achieving as she claims she is? He sounds like a real loser and it's completely unclear why she would ever want him given the way he treats her....except of course that she was desperate to have sex. Yuck. I was embarrassed for the whole lot of them (especially those poor kids!) and couldn't finish reading the book."
3,Good Book but,"The book was very enlightening, however it did not address the issue of how to deal w wa mother of a stepchild who was never married to your husband. I think the book addressed a lot of concerns and feelings I had but I never got a true understanding of how to be a step mother and coexist with a baby mama."
5,Funny,Very funny book for any step-mom trying to find her place in the already made family! A lot stories reminded me of my own experiences!
5,She gets it,"Wonderful book!! While reading a few pages before I ordered the book I was laughing and crying saying ""she gets it!!"" If you are looking for straight up answers to stepmom issues get this book. I am so thrilled I found it."
3,Its an OK book...,"The one issue with this book I have is that life is not a race. Kids, wives and ex-wives are not vying for attention from ""Dad."" It could have been a well written book if she stopped instilling the competition of coming ""second"" and allowing Dad to ignore his new wife for the sake of the kids."
1,No book prepares you for hell,"I would suggest ""Ex-Wives and Ex-LIves"" over this book. This book seems politically correct but doesn't delve into the stench of reality. I don't care how perfect you, as a new wife want to be, the kids and ex are often there to undermine you and sap you of any energy and motivation. I had ""Humor and Grace"" through gritted teeth and not one moment I spent, even with the step-kids who LOVED me, was worth the trouble of marrying a man with baggage. Even when the kids are great, the ex-wife is usually a problem 9 times out of 10. There's always some drama and it gets old really fast. Try the other book I mentioned at top of paragraph for a more realistic look. I'll add a review there too. I wish I had info when I became a step-parent and though these books aren't perfect, they're better advice than nothing. If anything they'll help you keep your sanity a while longer."
4,Good book for Stepmoms to be,"If you are considering dating or marrying a man with kids, this is the book for you. Most books on the subject leave you feeling depressed. This book holds out hope that you can survive and indeed thrive in a relationship with a man, his kids and his ex.Practical and current. recommended"
2,"Somewhat entertaining, but not helpful to me","I originally bought this book hoping for some sage advice on how to manage in life as ""the second wife / step-mom"" but was quickly disappointed. In all honesty; the book frightened me to the point of almost breaking it off with my newly divorced boyfriend. I remember thinking ""This is what the future holds for me if I stay with my boyfriend?"" The advice didn't seem to fit many of my situations while, at the same time, some of the stories hit too close to home. I also didn't like that the author seems comfortable in the idea that the second wife will always be ""second"". I have too much self respect for that manner of thinking. While we cannot change his (or our own) past, we do have the ability to create our futures and mine can include both my boyfriend and his children without sacrificing my own self respect."
5,A good read.,"Maybe I am blessed or maybe I am naive, but my current boyfriend is supportive so some of this does not apply directly to me. It could be that my parents were divorced so some of the issues that the kids feel I can relate to first hand. This book is a great read. It offers a lot of tips on what to expect. How to handle the ""You're not my mother"" statement, setting household rules for your home & family. It is also nice to know that the feelings, frustrations and such are normal. I highly recommend this book to everyone that is facing this situation. If nothing more it may prepare you for the worst."
2,Wearther Channel Temp Station ws-7215wc,Not very accurate for the outside temp. I placed several regular outdoor thermometers that agree with each other near the sending unit and the sending unit reads as much as 5 degrees off either direction. I tried different locations for both the sending unit and display unit. I removed the batteries and did the complete set-up again and still no improvement. Not happy with it.
2,Parts do not work,"I bought this item to know what my indoor temperture and humidity would be, and it does this as planned. It had an outdoor sensor but it does not work."
1,La Crosse Wireless Outdoor Thermostats,"Their Wireless Outdoor Thermostats are not waterproof and not even water resitent. It even says it is not waterproof in the fine print. Why would you make an outdoor thermostate and not make it water proof? I bought a replacement for it and put it in a protacted area but it still died after a couple of months. Where am I supposed to put it, in doors? This thing is crap and they obviously know it which indocates to me that all their stuff must me crap."
2,"Good Short Term, Beyond A Year No",Purchased unit about 14 months ago Worked great the first twelve months. The last two months unit and sensor wont communicate so cant get the outdoor temp. Also to note the clock has to be manually reset each time change batteries! Wouldn't recommend this product.
2,EAM,"Junk.This worked for about 6 months then just quit. I am getting very tired of spending money on cheaply made items that break in less than a year. I am trying to find a temperature station that is made in the USA, but having some difficulty."
1,A book I'd rather borrow than buy,"This is an okay book, about Great MenThe people reviewed in this book are great men of God. The book itself is kind of awkward. The author presents biographical sketches, interlaced with comments like, '...I admire the sacrifices that Hus' mother must have made, because I also had a mother and a grandmother who taught me to pray and seek the Lord from my youth. I can relate to the dedication and love that Hus' mother gave to her son. The love of a mother remains the same, no matter what generation she lives in.'These kind of musings occur throughout the book, and distract from the content. The author also provides a lot of opinions about the characters of these people, rather than just telling their stories.Overall, a book I'd rather borrow than buy. But I'd rather borrow a better book."
4,Great insight,Great read. Chapters highlighted key reformers in an interesting and detailed way. All this info in one volume...this book was very informative and a bargain. I found it very helpful and together with God's General's 1 a perfect edition to my library.
5,God's Reformers,Read this book and you will become an expert in the area of church ministry reform. It is just excellent and it is an excellent reference book.
2,Too slow!!!!!,"It's ok I guess but it could be a little quicker in the RPM department (maybe a limitation on all pnuematic drills).Also, you have to install the handle assembly which is very cheaply made.I expected more from Porter Cable.I would give it a 4 out of 10."
5,Used And Abused,"You have here a top rated saw by Consumer Reports . That's why I bought it. After using it over a year, I agree with them. As a contractor- I throw it in the truck and haul it all about. This saw has light weight but strength. The stop positions are very positive, much better than the Makita or the Delta saws I own. I use this saw to cut framing and do fine moulding. You will love this saw!"
3,Only in New York,"Only in New York could a cross-dressing, female opera impersonator rise to the top of the club scene in the late '70s, riding on a wave of the era's fascination with everything twisted and fetish. Nomi's sad, short life and the despicable way he treated his band are profiled, and seeing the live footage of him after all this time one is left to wonder: what were we thinking??? As one of the earliest casualties of AIDS he became emblematic, in a way that, perhaps, was not entirely to his disliking."
5,I Was Wrong,"I watched this movie last night after hearing Nomi for the first time a month ago.The first time I became familiar with Nomi was back in the early 1980s in high school. A friend of mine and I saw Nomi's picture in a music magazine. We both laughed at ""that weirdo"".Fast forward to June 2011. I saw the same picture online and looked him up on Youtube. He was an amazing talent, truly world class. I feel bad about casting such homophobic judgment on him. He died of AIDS complications before anyone knew what it was. Back then people thought AIDS could be spread via casual contact, so no one visited him in the hospital while he was dying.Klaus, RIP. You were the best."
4,Klaus Nomi and the New york art scene in the 80's,"This is a loveling crafted portrait of Klaus Nomi and the New york art scene in the 80's.I absolutly recomend it for both those who want to discover or remember.My only objection is not enough K. N. full performances or videos clips in the extras (only 3), otherwise them that buy it!"
4,The Nomi Song,"When I was England last year, I tried to find this dvd. Went to alot of record stores. But, as it turns out, all roads lead back to Amazon. The dvd is very cool. The only thing I missed was the booklet that comes w/the dvd. Other than that, I have nothing to complain about. If you're a fan, this is definitely something you should have in your collection."
4,An acquired taste,"I love this guy,and he left us too soon. I first saw him on ""Urgh! A Music War""-performing ""Total Eclipse"". He sang backup for David Bowie on SNL back in the day too. One performance only,probably the largest exposure to an American audience in his whole career. Falsetto,and in tune at that!"
4,Clarks slides,"good product, fairly comfortable. leather stiff at first, did get blisters but better once walked in a while."
2,Not for a foot with a high instep,These sandals appeared nice when they arrived but my instep is too high for them and I had to return them so I can't say a whole lot about them.
3,Not sony brand,I had it for 1 year and it went bad i think i used it 4 times but for the price a year is good sony battery s are much more but last forever. also the battery acid came out of it on the 4 the time i charged it so if you have kids keep it charging in a place they cant get to just in case it happens to you
3,Quality?,"I received this item today and I have 2 remarks. Like a previous reviewer said, the tool support is very bad and as shown in the product photograph, the blades section does not fit inside the lid. I will have to try and glue it to the lid. The second problem is that the hinges of box which I received were all broken. Other than these two issues, everything else were fine."
5,Decent set,Overall a nice set. The top section falls out every time I close the lid but some tape or something would probably help. I just haven't gotten around to messing with it.
2,Storage case is the worst!!!,"The Picture shows a nice storage case as I am familiar with. But the one I received was cheap and crappy to the max!!!! The storage inserts are not even close to the size of the box and extremely flimsy beyond belief, They are shrink wrapped and then glued to the box so when you unwrap it there is no means by witch to secure the trays. they are too small to fit snugly and are about useless. The knives themselves are acceptable but if you are looking for storage for them this case is not worth the low grade plastic within it. Not happy. :("
5,Xacto X5087 deluxe hobby tool set,This was a very comprehensive hobbies modelling kit. I have owned xacto before and It has always been of excelllent quality .
5,Yummy Shortbread,This little book is packed full of basic and yummy receipes. I'm on the journey to create the yummiest shortbread cookies and this book is a great start.
2,not as good as I thought it would be,This book was a bit of a disappointment. I thought it might be more authentic to shortbread in Great Britain.
5,She's the best!,Vestal Goodman is an inspiration. I'm only 14 but I can see this lady is one of a kind! This book tells her life story. But it's not only about her. There's something more to it. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. It's easy to read. I laughed and cried at times! This is definitely a wonderful book!
2,Caveat Emptor Cloe,"This is not a complaint against Cloe herself; but a warning about dealing with MGA Entertainment who makes her. I purchased the Spanish-language version on clearance at a Toys R Us store, because I only wanted to display her, not play/talk with her. There were 2 identical dolls. It was only after unpacking her, looking at all the illustrations, and verifying the fact online that I realized she was missing her cute feathery vest & belt. BOTH dolls I looked at were the same in that respect; both were totally unopened. ( In fact these are HORRIBLE to unbox: you HAVE to destroy the packaging! ) I contacted the MGA ""customer service"" website ( the one that promises a reply within 24 hours! ) to ask whey they were like that. Needless to say Cloe and I are still waiting, wondering WHERE her vest & belt are! If you have any problems with their merchandise, you're on your own!"
1,Wasted BOOK,"Frist, there are 10 cards/stones not 12. The author gives no information as to the positions of the layouts he uses-no definations for the positions of the medicine wheel reading, and the author does not support this book, he won,t answer email or phone calls(disconnected) local new age shops cant get their orders filled for stones because there is simply no response for the author-the publisher is not much help either.Dont waste your time with this book."
1,More Alpha Trash,"At least Alpha Video appears to be consistent. I've purchased two of them, and both are unwatchable. This movie would probably be a B or B+ if you could make out what the characters are saying or not be bothered incessantly by skipped dialogue and a horribe DVD picture transfer.Even the gorgeous Ann Sheridan doesn't look so hot in this movie. It may be that God-awful hair style. Or else it's just the D-- picture quality.Next DVD you buy - check to be certain its not an Alpha which, I believe, is Greek for awful."
4,"I love these, my daughter - not so much.","Before my 3 year old was born I saw these and bought them, I thought the were just too cute. When she was a tiny baby she liked to lick and suck on them, as she grew she played with them occasionally. The items inside were not as interesting to her as I thought they would be. The toy did not engage her, though her older sister enjoyed playing with them from the ages of 4-6. I just packed up my set and will be donating them to her school. I thought she would have become more engaged with them by now.Would make a great gift idea, but never know if it will be THE toy. Don't be disappointed if you child seems less than interested. As a parent, I loved them."
5,Perfect size,"This is the perfect size for our toddler, granddaughter to handle. She piles them up and her big sister knocks them down for lots of giggles and fun."
3,"Cute idea, but you can't see animals well","We bought these as an accessory to the ""Incrediblock""Incrediblock. The animal cubes are a very cute idea, but the yellow/green/purple base and top of each cube obscure the animals a lot. You kind of have to turn the cube this way and that to really see what is inside. My child is still too little to really peek into the blocks, so for now she's just perfectly happy stacking them in/on the Incrediblock."
2,For much smaller babies,"My son grew out of it very quickly, and frankly he didn't care about it at all.I would think this is for 6-9month old babies."
4,Good toy with medical conditions.,"This is a very good toy but lacks in a few areas. It seems this he-man is folliclly challenged and therefore has a blonde wig glued on. Also, it seems as if he-man has kyphosis and needs a good orthopedic surgeon."
5,Back and better than ever!,"This He-Man figure is looooooong overdue. Finally, kids these days can have a piece of the golden toy age. I really like his sword, shield, axe and just about everything about this He-Man is a great playtime experience. Kids young and old would love this toy. I highly recomend this action figure along with the other masters of the Universe toy line. I wish, though, that the chest piece would be a little better done. In my opinion, it could have been better."
4,Does what I need it to do,"This drawer set works great for the propose I bought it for, my baby's nursery. I love that I was able to customize it with iron on patches and since you can take the fabric part off the wood drawer frames you could do much more than that, paint, stamp, stencil even embroider with a machine or by hand. I also like that you can paint it any color you wish, however, when it says ""unfinished"" please keep in mind that it literally means bare wood, not even a clear coat, which I highly recommend you taking the extra time to do in order to protect the wood. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't look quite as neat as the picture shows it, the drawers do not hang all the way down to the top of the next drawer so you can see what's inside them even when the drawers are closed. Keep that in mind if you are looking for something to hid stuff in!"
3,Almost made it...,"I bought this to store art and sewing supplies next to my desk, and it works well for that.Pros: Not an enormous set of drawers. It's perfect for things other than linens. The canvas drawers stay on with velcro and they really stay on. None of them have fallen off due to being too heavy. It also all feels and has managed to be very sturdy.Cons: The wood is unfinished, which isn't terrible but kind of disappointing. If you pull the drawers out, they obviously can't hold themselves up on their own - they aren't rigid. When the drawers get too heavy, they kind of drag on the one below it, which is more a nuisance than anything."
2,"Unremarkable, Mundane Contemporary Choreography","Hans Van Manen's program, Mix4Kids, is an unexciting compilation of his contemporary choreographies - Ajakaboembie, In and Out, (parts of) Bits and Pieces, and In the Future. Featuring decent dancers and miscellaneous modern music, the choreographies use dry humor and cliched choreographic tricks to attempt at a portrayal of a vague story. In the Future is the most interesting of all the pieces, if only for its original, minimalistic costumes and scenery. To fans of Hans Van Manen, and perhaps die-hard fans of contemporary ballet, this would be an ideal pick; but for most balletomanes, I would say to avoid this DVD."
3,John Ritter: A Brilliant Farceur,"This DVD features five episodes plus a tribute.Here are the episodes:""Downhill Chaser"" (season 5) - Jack and the gang are at a ski resort.""Urban Playboy"" (season 6) - Jack and the gang hide out at Cindy's family farm.""Baby, It's Cold Inside"" (season 8) - Jack and Mr. Furley end up locked in a freezer.""Up In the Air"" (season 6) - Jack mixes tranquilizers and alcohol at a party.""Cupid Works Overtime"" (season 8) - Jack meets Vicky, an airline stewardess."
3,Short and sweet,"Some things to consider before buying this DVD:* No episodes with Chrissy (Suzanne Somers) or the Ropers* The last episode (""Cupid Works Overtime"") ends with ""to be continued"" (and isn't on this DVD)* ""Up in the Air"" is probably the funniest episode of the show I've ever seen and includes Jack's long, famous, dancing-under-the-influence sceneOverall, thanks to ""Up in the Air"", the low price, and the bonus tribute to John Ritter (which includes footage of his Emmy win--at which Ted Danson was a fellow nominee: ""And thank you to Ted Danson's daughter ...""), I recommend this for fans of Ritter/Jack who aren't inclined to buy entire seasons of Three's Company."
1,Simply dull and listless...Major dissapointment.,Other performances in this cycle are exeplary but this interpretation of Beethoven 9 is in some ways one of the weakest performances in this cycle. The choir pronounces german with little or not uniformity and the consanants are not together. On top of this the Baritone has very little power unlike the Karajan Walter Berry combination. While the slow movement is quite nice there is really little happening...whereas the Fricsay Beethoven 9 had an incredible power...I think there are alot of better budget alternatives...including Furtwangler in Bayreuth on EMI which sounds incredible for its time....Szell is simply not shaping phrases or even attempting to mould phrases. In other words this is one of the worst and least exciting 9ths on record...go to Herbert K. or even Bohm to see what I mean. As for the Fidelio the solo horn is off pitch most of the time...
3,Not yet Installed,"I am waiting to get some baseline info on the OEM set-up before I install this new Air Intake System. Not to be called a CAI (cold air intake) as it is not. I was rather disappointed when I looked at how the new Heat Shield was going to fit into the space of the removed OEM box. A large portion of the bottom area, a portion of the front, and the space between the intake tube and the shield were all open to the engine compartment. After questioning K&N about my concerns they addressed all my questions and explained that it didn't make any difference. I guess I'll probably never know for sure as far as that goes. (I have pictures of the poor fit but could not see a way to upload them.)"
2,"2012 charger...sloppy fit, not what I expected of K&N","bought for the 2012 charger R/T super road and track model. Main difference is I have paddle shifters and a 3.06 rear end instead of a 2.56.... however this kit is a lame excuse from K&N; of laziness. I'm not fully pleased with it and I'll likely purchase another brand down the road that I've heard fits better. this does not sit and look pretty in the car as one would expect. being a 2012 apparently means a few parts had to be adjusted since my model isn't exactly the same as the previous models.Thanks for confirming various times that this is the right one and for my model K&N; you're in fact rather wrong, although I adjusted it to make it look better. that's not why I bought it, I wanted it to install and work"
4,K&N CAI for 2011 Challenger R/T,"This was a project I looked forward to. I am pleased with the purchase and the performance but do wish I had looked at others a little harder. Works great, looks ok but not as much a one piece look as I would have preferred. Install was a pain looking at instruction. I suggest look at instructions for a bit then just build it looking at the picture. I also had to cut the weather stripping that comes for the filter box. Next project will be a performance exhaust and a tuner. More air in, gotta let more air out."
5,Teach anyone to be an outstanding reader!,"I homeschool my children, so obviously, I am responsible for teaching them how to read. This book was highly recommended to me by a fellow homeschool mom (who had previously spent hundreds of dollars on fancy reading programs and said that those were a waste of money), who used it to teach her kids how to read. Now in middle school, her kids excel on state standardized tests, and do very well in their subjects. She attributes their smartness to the foundations set for them in this book. So I got it and my son was reading by age 5. My 3-year-old already is a pro at his letters, sound discrimination, and can even tell you what the difference between a vowel and a consonant is! This book is wonderful, and makes teaching reading very easy. Not only that, this author does a fantastic job of putting lessons together for you, so all of the work is already done!"
5,Great for the Beginning Homeschooling Parent,"I love this book and how easy it is to use. I started to teach my son to read with the Veritas Press Phonics Museum Curriculum. It didn't work for us and I wanted something more simple that just focused on reading. Not reading and writing and art all jumbled together. After reading ""The Well Trained Mind"" and a recommendation from my friend, we began this program. I love the simplicity of it and how everything is laid out for you. I really need that, especially with my first year homeschooling.We are halfway through the book and my 5 year old son is sounding out words and reading the short stories wonderfully! I like how there are no pictures with the stories. I sometimes supplement with readers and the pictures actually distract him from reading the words. I highly recommend this book, if I could give it more stars I would."
2,Very bland and boring,"This curriculum is broken down nicely into short straightforward lessons, however, it is very dry and boring. My first grader, who is struggling with reading anyway, hated it. So it wasn't any fun for me either. Maybe it would be okay for a student who reads very easily, I don't know. But we switched to Hooked on Phonics and that is working a lot better. Hooked on Phonics is a party compared to this!"
2,good for some not for others,"This book works well for a child (like my oldest) who is extremely driven and oral repetitiveness feeds her the logic needed to process reading. However, my second child is a visual learner that learns quickly when her interests are engaged and there is an activity for reinforcement. This book does not work very well for her. There are no pictures, activities, or much of anything other than ""repeat after me"" lines. She is painfully bored with simple oral recitation, and I will be making some changes so as to not continue her strong disdaine for our reading time. I want to foster a LOVE for reading."
4,"Calm and structured, but not especially engaging","The title is accurate: it really is designed for ordinary parents without special training. It does very straightforward phonics with a minimum of equipment (just notecards, really), then eventually introduces short sentences for a child to read aloud from the book. This made it good for travel -- we could keep doing lessons on the hotel room floor.We're only a third of the way through the book (short words with short vowel sounds). While I mostly enjoy it, I've found that I need to supplement its lessons with other types of games and activities to keep it from being so dry. The book offers some suggestions for games, but a visit to an educational supply store would probably be helpful."
4,A useful supplement,"This Audio CD is a useful supplement to the Ordinary Parent's Guide. You may be suprised to find you actually don't know how to pronounce many of the letters of the alphabet correctly. It is very important you teach them correctly to your children, especially if they have any speech difficulties. For example, 'D' is not pronounced 'duh'. Teach your child the wrong pronunciation and they may wind up having some difficulty sounding out words. The CD will model for you the difference between the voiced and unvoiced consonants, which will be invaluable. There are also some fun song tracks, and the complete Consonant Rhyme, which is learned in the book. You can just turn this on, and Presto! It isn't meant to listened to beginning to end, however."
3,Visually Intimidating for Young Readers,"This book is both the teacher's manual and child reader in one. The problem with this is that the sections intended for the young child to read are surrounded with paragraphs of instruction to the teacher. My child gets intimidated by all the words on the page when I ask her to read from this book. She much prefers reading from a small book reader (like the ""Bob"" books) which have one sentence per page and an accompanying illustration.The method in the book does seem effective because after using this for 5 months with my 3 - 4 year old. she is reading short sentences, however, I have noticed that she reads by memorization and still has trouble making out new words using phonics."
5,So far so good,"My four year old and I are on the ninth lesson, we are still learning letters. But, so far its a great book, very simple, my daughter begs for the lessons every day so she is enjoying it!"
5,Love it,"My son and I have only done a few lessons so far (the short-vowel sounds and a handful of consonants), but he has already started to read random words to me. We've been doing letters for a while, but I just love the way this book presents everything, and my son loves climbing into our big snuggly chair where we have our reading lessons together.Oh - my son has a really high activity level, but he adores sitting for our lesson. He has also been using starfall for about a year, but it doesn't really seem to have done much. I think the computer game thing is a good, fun reinforcement, but it is no where near as effective as the one-on-one focused learning that this book advocates.UPDATE: My oldest is finishing this book this week, and he is now an avid reader! He is 7, and just finished The Trumpet of the Swan. We are definately using this simple but effective program with my 4 year old!"
5,Ohne Hast,"Mahler's fourth symphony is perhaps most memorable for its unsettlingly gorgeous second movement, entitled 'In gemächlicher Bewegung. Ohne Hast.'No modern conductor's name is more easily associated with the great romantic composer than George Szell. This 1965 recording shows the Cleveland Orchestra stepping superbly through Mahler's score, allowing that second movement all the time it requires to develop its inexorable and unhurried momentum in true Mahleresque style.It doesn't end there, of course. Throughout the Fourth Symphony and the Lieder, Szell and his musicians are acutely on task, able to brood intelligently in a way that Mahler--the late Romantic definitive Über-Brooder--would have approved. Many critics refer to this recording as among the two or three definitive readings of the works it covers, all of which accrues to the merit of the Sony Classical project and its sound engineers."
2,poor translation,This was a third rate translation that never should have been printed. The Norton Edition is like night and day compared to this primitive translation. I enjoyed both books but the Dunnigan translation is over inferior quality. I recommend War and Peace just not this edition.
5,Amazing book!,"I have read this novel thrice, the first time being when I was just 12 years old. Now I am 18, and Tolstoy's writing doesn't cease to amaze me. Each time I engross myself in the novel, I find something new, something that wasn't there before. I would recommend this piece of literature to everyone, young or old."
2,Not good,"I learned some details I didn't know in this book, but otherwise it is a blandly written book, that didn't keep my interest (I skimmed parts). And I recently saw Ringo Starr in concert, and he was much more charismatic than I thought he would be (and I'm a Beatles NUT, so I didn't think he'd be boring!). To think that such a lively performer, and a living legend, could have such a dull biography written about him, is a shame."
1,"Mr. Clayson, Tell Us About Ringo!","This is the best book about Ringo Starr because it's the ONLY book, which is quite a shame. Ringo has led an incredibly interesting life, full of ups and downs, but this book somehow avoids those interesting stories. The author does appear to know a great deal about the music scene in England in the late 50's and early 60's, but he does not appear to know a great deal about the World's Greatest Drummer. For example, this book lists Ringo's drumming in the song ""Birthday"" as his only drum solo. What? Did he forget to buy and listen to Abbey Road and the drum solo from ""The End""? This is a huge mistake. Mr. Clayson does not really seem to be very interested in Ringo, and he certainly does not appear to really respect him. Therefore, I think Beatles fans and Ringo fans will be disappointed by this book."
2,Not worth your time,"This book is just hard to read -- period. One would think that a biography on Ringo would be like himself -- fun. Instead, Clayson wrote a book on an interesting subject and made it as much fun to read as the collected works of Milton. Maybe Clayson is embarrassed that a writer of his ""caliber"" is churning out books on Ringo, instead of writing the great British novel, and wants the reader to suffer along with him. God knows he seems more intent on showing the reader how smart he is, rather than informing and entertaining us.Clayson also seems focused on Pete Best, who I guess gave him an interview (Ringo would not). Finally, there are many sloppy factual errors in the book. The one error I found most ridiculous was Clayson's saying that there was trumpet on Helter Skelter. A trumpet? Is he sure there wasn't a fiddle and banjo on that one too?One of the few interesting things about the book is a picture of Ringo as Elton John tries to kiss him. His expression is priceless."
2,Poorly written,"It's good that someone has written a biography of Ringo. Unfortunately, Mr. Clayson's prose style is confusing and convoluted, and he touches on many subjects obscure to the matter at hand."
1,Is this book about Ringo?,"I learned more about Rory Storm than I did about Richard Starkey. While I did gain some insight, there is little here for those who wish to know Ringo Starr better. Too often there are whole pages with little or nothing to do with the book's supposed main topic. I checked it out of the library, as it was the only Ringo book there. I'm very glad that I didn't waste my hard earned money on this pulp. I do not feel any wiser for having read it."
1,uninteresting,i bought this book on ringo starr---read only some of it.it was boring and uninteresting.i did not like the style of writing at all.i learnt little about ringo in this book....i returned the book for a refund!
5,Ugly Doll - Green Wage,I love Ugly Dolls and they're fun to collect. I think they're cute. I ordered Wage and got her really quick.
5,"Good look at modernism, postmodernism and evangelicalism","Hal Knight provides an excellent overview of evangelicalism. His first chapter on the history and character of evangelicalism is worth the price of the book. But he also gives a good overview of modernism and postmodernism. He then discusses theological responses to these movements, focusing on the evangelical response. In the book's last section, Knight offers the outline of his own attempt at an evangelical theology that relates to the postmodern world. He succeeds admirably. This book is for anyone who wants to understand the nature of truth in today's world. It points to Jesus Christ as the Truth for all times."
1,The worst mystery set in ancient Egypt that I have ever read,"For a man with a doctorate, P.C. Doherty reveals an absolutely abysmal research standard for this novel and its fellows. (The queen is not Hatasu, but Hatshepsut, married to a king whose name is usually transcribed as Thutmose II. The Sea Peoples show up in the reign of Ramses III, several hundred years after the action of these novels. Apart from the historical inaccuracies, the spellings reveal that no book less than 100 years old was used in the author's ""research"".) To reach such a low standard, I can only assume that Mr. Doherty found some 110-year volume and used that outdated information. If you want a good read set in ancient Egypt, may I recommend Lynda Robinson's Lord Meren. Lauren Haney's Captain Bak series and Anton Gill's ""City of the Horizon"" are all far superior to this book."
4,Your Heart Will Flutter (though your brain may mutter),"LE PAPILLON deals cards that we've all seen before; in this case, it's the ""charming urchin works elderly curmudgeon into seeing life in a new way, and vice-versa"" hand. But the film's beautiful outdoor setting and the masterful acting by Michel Serrault as said curmudgeon manage to overcome the film's worst sentimental tendencies.But the plot does have some holes you could drive a Renault through; most conspicuously, how did Elsa free-fall into a deep crevasse without a scratch? And are we really supposed to believe she's nine? (She could be five.)Still, you have to admire any movie that spends so much time on entomology.SIDELIGHT: If you have seen LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, you should recognize Michel Serrault, even without his makeup."
4,good for young French students,"I teach KG-6th grade French. It is tough to find French films (other than cartoons) appropriate for this age. The Butterfly is a great film for French teachers. Other than 1 off-color joke, there is no offensive material at all and the subject is totally appropriate for students starting in about 4th grade. Plus it's short. I enjoyed the film and plan to show it to my students."
3,The butterfly,"I bought this movie to show in my French class thinking that it might lead to interesting discussions. In addition, unlike many French films, it seemed to be appropriate to show to high schoolers. While, the latter is true, I'm not sure about the former. I enjoyed the film but I'm not sure if it will hold the interest of my audience. It's philosophical, tender and slow- moving but there's not much as far as intrigue goes. If you like movies that analyze characters rather than tell a story, then this should interest you."
5,Great Holster,"I've had this holster for months and once it's broken in, it works very well. I use the streamlight tasklight 3AA battery led light. Although it's longer it has the same body width as the mini maglight that the holster is designed for. So if you have a similar flashlight it will work well with it. Highly recommended!"
5,"The Holster is a dream, it not only accepts the three cell but it also accepts the two cell.",Although the holster started out to be rather tite on the flashlite it soon became easy to take the lite out.
2,Rivet broke after 6 weeks of use,This is a great unit and fits the flashlight well. But the rivet completely pulled free of the leather with less than 6 weeks of use and rendered it unusable. Very unhappy with product quality.
5,Maglite AM2A026 Plain leather holster for mini Maglite,"Seems to be of very good quality thick leather. A bit too tight for my Maglite, but I expect it to loosen over use. Looks best with the black Maglite. The Camo Maglite stands out a bit."
1,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT,"This was a terrible product. I bought just about every swim aid made for my son, and we hated this one. It did no keep his head above water, and the pads inside pushed up in to his face and eyes. Our fav product is the SWIMWAYS SWIM SWEATER."
5,Give me my Bush Cards or give me death,"You can have my Bush Cards when you pry them from my cold, dead hands."
5,Hilarious fun for all your partisan friends,Bush Cards Rock! You must own them if you think every world leader deserves a bit of his (or her) own medicine...or even if you just like to whoop it up American style.
4,Almost All the Way,"Very stylish shoe, but the back part of the shoe is a bit slippery and my heel tends to slide out when I walk even though I bought the right size. Overall still a very comfortable, stylish shoe."
4,Quo fans quit bitchin & enjoy,"Is this Quo at their early best, of course not. No one can name any band but the Beatles who were great all the time. The great hard rock music created by Quo would actually become stale if every Cd sounded exactly the same. Take this for what it is, very listenable rock from a band who deserves to be in the Rock & Roll hall of fame. I really enjoy listening to this CD. So what if it is a little lighter, it's good music. I am close to having all of Quo's studio cd's & I like them all. They did come back with a new cd ""In Search of The Fourth Chord"" which is an awesome Cd. Please read all my reviews for the Best in Rock"
1,"Foxy-01 33/4"" Pointed Toe Clasic Pump",These shoes were not put together very well. The bottom of the heal part broke of and was bending inward from the second I put them on. If I had the choice to buy this breand again I would not. These shoes were very over priced and not put together well at all. I am very disappionted.
4,Great flat-black heels,"I bought these for a wedding and they were perfect. I lot higher than I usually wear, but my shoes are usually of the sneaker variety. Not a bad shoe for the price and now I have a basic black heel for any outfit."
3,Pink Shoes,"These were advertised as fuschia color; they're not. They're hot pink so I returned them. Other than that, I like them."
5,A Healing Gift,"Where there is longing to understand the deeper meaning of your journey and have more clarity about the roles of the people in your life...Carmen Harra's ""Everyday Karma"" inspires greater heartfelt confidence with life's challenges and offers more empowering choices to live a happier, more authentic life."
5,An inspiration!,"After reading this wonderful book I couldn't put it down, so I read it a second time. Then I booked a telefone conversation with Carmen Harra and met a woman with amazing skills and it seems that she already knew me. In my list of spiritual books, this book is in the top 5."
5,Everyday Karma: A Renowned Psychic Shows You How To Change,"Everyday Karma demonstrates the ability each one of us has to overcome obstacles and improve our lives. Through simple, yet relaxing and powerful exercises, it becomes readily apparent that we are all blessed with strength, intuition and the power to gain control and find inner piece. Carma Harra is a truly gifted intuitive who is eager to share her talents."
5,No nonsense and down to earth!,"A great book! In some marvelous way this book has clarified for me the difference between the way of the ego and the way of the soul. It has made a definate impact on my life, helping me become more aware of this difference. Ego and soul appear to be the one and same ""I"", but like salt and sugar they are quite different. I enjoyed too the family history, what a fascinating background! And the end? Well, it will be interesting to see just what does happen."
3,for esoteric people only,"I gave it to my mother and she loved it; she said the exercises offered in the book to relax or something are great.On another note, I took a look at the book and read that she knew 09/11 was going to happen before it happened. Intrigued, I made an appointment to have a phone consultation with her; $200 bucks for 30 minutes. It was 4 years ago and NONE of what she said happened.Beware."
5,A karmic delight,Everyday Karma was an enlightening and enjoyable read. The book was easy to follow and understand. Life is very complicated and full of difficulties for the average person but Everyday Karma simplifies it all. Dr. Carmen Harra explaines the depth and value of a person's actions and reactions. Even the most insignificant action can create karmic instability. She also stresses the importance of karmic resolution and has creates a system to do so. Every chapter of this book leaves the reader enlightened and pondering the importance of life. It makes one want to be a better person. Definately a worth while read and a good book to have around for re-reading during difficult times.
5,A must read for everyone,"Out of my library on spritual development and growth, this one is in my top 5 going up against Neale Donald Walsch, Deepak Chopra, Dr. Phil, and James Van Praagh. Dr. Harra is an enlightened soul sent here to guide us all to improve and enjoy our lives to the greatest extent. Her book, Everyday Karma, shows us all how to deeply explore our intentions of why we are here, who we are here with and why we have chosen to ""create"" the blessed existence that we all share."
5,Hood does for Fantasy what Asimov did for SF,"A legitimate puzzler whodunnit in a fantasy realm? At first glance, preposterous. It would be too difficult to avoid cheating. Which is what they said of mysteries in Science Fiction before Asimov showed how it could be done. Daniel Hood has pulled off the equivalent feat with his novels of Liam Rhenford, crafting fully satisfying mysteries in a detailed and vivid Fantasy realm. I should confess--I first discovered these stories when the publisher sent me a copy of Beggar's Banquet for review (not understanding that I do not do SF&F reviews). I was first intrigued, then hooked, then wowed. I spent my own money on the other two novels in print, will buy the fourth (actually the 2nd) if it becomes available again, and will snap up those that follow."
1,There was no moral to this story,"My father was in the Army during my childhood. He retired as a Lt. Colonel and spent 22 years defending this country. I have a strong patriotic leaning and support our troops anytime they are deployed. I cannot support Peccant Luther and A Tale Told By A Sleeper by James Mintz even though it was written in response to the events on September 11. It is a collection of random, uncollected thoughts tied together with hate and bigotry. The blatant racism and overall intolerance of every character in this book was pointless and disgusting.If there was a greater theme in this book, I missed it. If there was a point to writing this type of garbage, I missed it. If there was a moral to this story, I missed it. I would strongly advise against anyone reading this book."
1,FRUIT SALADS NOT SALSAS,"I'm very dissapointed,the book says 50 best salsas. Obviously the publisher named this book to get some sales regardless of what is on the pages. It's more like CUSTOM FRUIT SALADS.I was looking for salsas not fruit salads. More than half the book is fruit salads. If you looking for classic or typical salsas and some good variations of those then THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU. Needless to say I was disapointed since I dont fancy bluberry, rasberry, stawberry, watermellon, pear, zuchini or pineapple salsas and the like. These hardly classify for 50 best salsas."
1,Not great,"I've used Steiner 8x30 Military/Marine binoculars for 20 years and have found them to be the best value for my dollar of any binoculars I've used. With that in mind, I had high hopes for these 8x22 Predators. I was disappointed. The exit pupil is so small, it's almost impossible to get a good clear view through the binoculars. Also, the edges of the field of view seemed slightly blurry. And last, once I adjusted the left eyepiece to give ma a decent picture at 100 yards, then used the center focus knob to focus for closer or farther distances, I would have to readjust the left eyepiece to get a clear picture at the new distance. The combination of these problems made the binoculars virtually unuseable. Not sure if the low-end Steiners made in the Czech Republic are just not up to the quality of yesteryear, or if these are just common problems with compact binoculars, but I sent them back for a refund."
5,"Great, inspirational summer reading","Karen Duffy's book was amazing. The subject matter is quite serious, but she handles it with flair and humor unlike any I have come across. Too often books dealing with illness center around medical aspects, but this book was much more about life and how it was affected. It was an excellent book, one of my alltime favorites"
5,I'm loved it and I'm only 17!,"People tell me all the time that I haven't lived yet, that I still have a lot to experience. Karen Duffy and her book showed me a excerpt of what life can end up to be. The reason I'm telling you my age is because when you are 17 you have so many dreams. Mostly to be famous. You want to live the life that you see on t.v. You want to wine and dine with the rich and fabulous, yet it never occurs to you that something like what happen Duffy can happen. Yet what I found remarkable was that she still found humor in her situation and still pushed on. When I read this book I fell in love with Karen Duffy personality and I now one of my dreams is to meet her. I promise you, you will laugh you ""wisea__"" off."
4,Would like an update on Duf's condition,"I enjoyed this book and would lovean update on Duf's condition. Toward the end of the book, shementioned the mass found in heruterus. Was it serious? Has shebeen able to conceive a child?Does anyone have an update?"
1,A huge waste of time and money,"I guess you either love it or hate it. I hated it. I'll stick with any book to the end, even if I'm only hoping it'll get better. I could only torture myself through half of this book before calling it quits. It's nothing more than a pile of name dropping and me, me, and more me. Even the disease itself is trivialized in this presentation. Her first symptom was that her head felt like it was exploding. But why doesn't she see a doctor? Because she has a star-studded date to go to the star-studded awards show. Later, fly to NY, see doctor about unimagineable pain in head, and then it's more off-to-here and off-to-there with You-Know-Who and You-Know-Who-Else and He-gave-me-this and Another-He-gave-me-that.I know it was supposed to be light reading, but there was absolutely nothing to it, no insight to anything. Annoying really describes it best for me."
1,Ridiculous,"A ridiculous book by another self-consumed celebrity wanna-be. I would not purchase this book for anyone. The writing is unclear, repetitive, fragmented. Boring!"
1,Duff's Life as An Incurable Name Dropper,"One word about this book: TRASH. It's clear Ms. Duffy's main goal in writing this book was to name drop. I found it poorly written, self absorbed and boring. The book should be retitled: ""Model Poser: My Life As an Incurable Name Dropper.""Any testimonials about this book must be written by the Karen Duffy street team..."
1,BORING! NO SOUL! GIVE MONEY TO A LEGITIMATE FOUNDATION!,"Material girl gets sick, manipulates sickness for fame, writes book to buy more materials.Perhaps she should just GO AWAY!"
1,Sickening,Horribly written. I use to be a big fan but I feel sorry for celebrities who have to stay in ther limelight by exploiting tragedy. She should just go away.
5,This is a keeper,"I was moved to have heard about Karen Duffy's illness on talk shows. I have always admired her sense of humor, but not as much as I admire her courage and strength. This is a wonderful uplifting and insightful look at illness and the importance of the ability to laugh in the face of doom and to drop your drawers and moon fate. High five Ms. Duffy."
4,Disease and a positive outlook,"Karen Duffy writes about her affliction with a somewhat uncommon disease in a biographical tale that combines a story about her interesting life with a story about her life dealing with the trials and tribulations of sarcoidosis,a chronic inflammatory disease that affects many different parts of the body.Her wonderful sense of humor and upbeat attitude make this book most entertaining as well as inspiring."
2,"Fun, light read, annoying name dropping","We bought this book as my wife was recently diagnosised with sarcoidosis. The humor of the author pervades this book, and her positive attitude about her illness was enjoyable. However, the constant name dropping of who she was dating and where she was going out to gets real boring and annoying fast. A nice, very light enjoyable read, but seems more suited as a book for Duffy fans."
5,Entertaining and informative,This book opened my eyes to many facts about sarcoid that I was unaware of and were presented in many funny ways.
4,"""100 Proof Duff""!!","I'm a longtime fan of Duff, and finished reading this book the same day I got it. It's honest, laugh out loud funny, and full of her unique personal style. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that whoever proofread it did a ratty job - it's full of annoying little typos. Do yourself a favor: burn your copy of ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" (Duff's idea),and read this instead! You won't need a box of Kleenex (although it does go nicely with your favorite alcoholic beverage). Love ya' Duff!!"
5,"Very good, actually","The book is excellent for its type, and unusual.While fully acknowledging the horrors of her sarcoidosis, Duffy makes the point that deathly illness needn't result in exactly the sort of crushing depression that would allow the illness to triumph. Her book goes beyond the bromide that ""laughter is the best medicine"" to examine the actual practice of survival. That she is even in a position to recount her ordeal and that she does so in such an engaging way and with such good humor are a testament to the utility and sincerity of her outlook.""Death Be Not Proud"" it ain't, and neither is it a clinical guide to the grieving process...and clearly Duffy doesn't want it to be either one. Certainly her condition is both very real and very dire, and a little levity in the face of all that misfortune is a relief after the maudlin weepiness of so much latter-day disease literature. I recommend it heartily, particularly to the similarly afflicted and those who love them."
4,As previous review,"It's getting a little old now, but even 5 years ago - when I first picked this up - I bought it for $5 from a bargain bin. This has to be one of the very best compilations of electronica I've heard, certainly the best I've ever scored for 5 dollars! It's a very smooth, dub-influenced set spiced with nice natural sound samples (even the dreaded b*ng cliche appears yet doesn't embarass). Many of the artists are obscure, but they also appear on other LSD releases, and the album floats without deflating from begin to end. Recommended."
5,Great textbook,"I needed this textbook for Nutrition class in college and I am going to keep it after I finish because it is a ""must have $ must read"" book."
4,for PKD novices and acolytes,"Overall, a very strong and representative collection of PKD's short stories. These shorts in this binding include a lot of old favorites that are arranged chronologically so we can watch PKD's obsessions and themes emerge and unfold and develop. It also allows us to see where he managed to frustrate himself along the way as well. Anyone reading this would do well to read the PKD bio by Emmanuel Carrere, ""I Am Alive And You Are Dead""; it's interesting to line up the parallels in PKD's life with his recurring tropes and stylistic choices."
3,"Mediocre writer, great idea man","I've always loved science fiction but the idea that somehow Dicks was a 'great writer' rubbed me wrong. Perhaps because I myself am a writer and have an advanced degree in English [re: forced to read a plethora of excellent writing] I've always read with a [overly] critical eye. Dicks stikes me as a very lazy writer who, in his desire to get out his ideas, skips development or careful construction and just rushes to the dénouement, loose ends be damned. But.. I love the ideas! Like Twilight Zone instant good stuff. I don't deny it, I'm esentially lazy also! Still, for truly great Sci-Fi read, say, Gene Wolfes' The Fifth Head of Cerberus or Lem's Solaris..if your a lazy reader don't bother. The guy who claims King or what's-his-face as great, well, that says it all!"
5,question,"Might someone please list the stories included in this volume? I really don't need editorial, just the titles. I can't exactly purchase something if I don't know what I'll be getting."
1,Malfunctioned Soon After Purchase,"After using the camera for about 1 month, it stopped working. It's completely dead. The bigger problem is that there will not be another camera in stock for 2 months!!Another family member has the Coolpix 4100 and we feel the 4600 is inferior to that model."
3,Nikon Camera,I thoroughly enjoy using this nikon camera. I tend to drop things sometimes and the one part came out slightly when I dropped it. This does not affect the quality or use of the camera it just looks slightly broken.
3,"Not quite a classic, but enjoyable","Here's a mostly-forgotten bit of monster fun from Hanna Barbera, circa 1980. The Drak Pack centers on three teenage descendants of the legendary Dracula, Wolfman, and the Frankenstein monster. Instead of perpetuating the monsterous mythos of their ancestors, these guys are trying to do some good. Leading the pack is the ""Big D"" himself. Their comically-inept adversaries comprise the group O.G.R.E. (Organization for Generally Rotten Enterprises).Mix Scooby Doo and The Groovie Goolies and, well, you'd probably still come up with something a bit more fun and engaging than The Drak Pack. Still, it's good clean fun, especially for monster fans. As is typical of HB animated releases, the video and audio presentation are more than adequate, if unremarkable. There are no special features in the 3-disc set.Recommended mostly for nostalgia purposes; I imagine modern kids will find the humor and action rather bland."
4,Episode 5 sound messed,"It's a shame This Set is Really Cool Up to episode 5. I wish this had subtitles, The music is so loud I can't hear the voices at all, It's more like watching a show with an isolated score."
3,Good times,"Got to me fast, in great shape, plus it brought back a lot of memories for me. Now I share that with my grand kids ."
5,Drak movie,This is a cool cartoon. Just like Scooby doo back then. All in all it was a treat to watch it. Thank you.
5,It's Not Too Late,"It is somewhat embarrassing to admit that for years I completely missed the boat when it comes to Guided by Voices-even though I've always interested in finding some of the most obscure bands out there. For reasons I'll never be able to explain, Guided by Voices has always flown just under my radar though I always knew that they were out there. Finding this box set for me is like finding one of the sources of the Nile because I can hear influences of their work on many of my other favorites. So while this johnny-come-lately kicks himself for missing out on this band for so long, I can give you one good piece of advice: go out and get the Hardcore UFOs box set and see for yourself. It is like everything, and nothing that you've heard before. My Christmas wish of receiving this box set has been fulfilled. Now I only wish that I'd been a fan all along."
4,Original plot that flows well,"This was an enjoyable read. It's hard to find a book with an original story line these days, and this definitely did. The plot was well executed. I was impressed, and will recommend this book to others."
5,Read in 10 hours,Fallen From Grace was my first romance novel. I was pleasantly surprised by the somewhat complex storyline and depth of the characters. There was enough sultry moments to make a girl swoon but this is by no means a dirty book. It was a very fast read and would be a great beach book. If u want a classy romance novel I believe this is a great option.
4,Most Novel and Interesting Romance Read In A While,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this book. I read a ton of contemporary romances and the plot summary for ""Fallen From Grace"" was different from the rest. I didn't buy it right away, but I found I kept thinking about it and coming back to it. Finally I just gave in a got it and boy I am glad that I did. I loved it. I was totally drawn into Ryan's story. I do agree with another reviewer's assessment that his character and back story are more richly developed and frankly just more interesting than Sara's. I had wondered if I would be able to suspend judgement on Ryan for being a prostitute and if I would still find him desirable. No problems there, you can't help but sympathize with him and fall in love with him. I highly recommend this book. It was so much more than I thought it would be. Enjoy!"
1,"Dull, no sparks...","Everytime the heroine spoke, I would cringe. She made the most ridiculous comments and helped him out when he came home beaten and brutalized by getting the first aid kit...2 times!! It almost seemed like this story was written to give voice to a lot of different causes...Save the Homeless...Lesbians are People, too...Take in Stray Animals...Free all Male Prostitutes!Of course the story ended a little too quickly and no loose ties were left undone...it was reminiscent of a bad movie of the week."
5,Blow Up Hollywood brings Drama to Sound,"Fake is the second album by Blow Up Hollywood. The kind of group that tries to tell stories in a way that go beyond their corporeal existance. They tap the ethereal beauty of acoustic guitar and strings and then combine them with just enough of a rock essence to create an aural palet that depicts(desounds?) a dieing relationship. There are great songs here punctuated by the sounds of a resperator telling us that the relationship is living and breathing but struggling. The music guides us through like an artfull,entertaining foreign film.Blow Up Hollywood are artists in the true sence,trying to elavate their music above themselves.There is little hype here,just artistry.If you can appreciate that,this music is for you."
2,Not quite an impressive angel.,This product was poorly made and not worth the cost. The glue was gobbed and the fiber optics were clumped together. The quality would be something one would expect from a dollar days store. DONT BUY
5,Just right!,"I have read upto page 42 out of total 147 pages (excluding answers to Practice Exercises). I like the book very much and I find it easy to read, logically organised and the coverage and approach is just right! Besides, the book is handy to carry around (smaller than A4 size and not thicker than 200 pages - this is important for non full-time students). Moreover, the practice exercises are realistic enough to test your understanding of what you've read. I highly recommend this book to students, adult learners and really anyone who would like to review ESSENTIAL grammar."
4,"Grammar on the go, that works",Any book on grammar can tell you the specifics; this book provides example sentences that test your knowledge. Very easy read; very helpful.
4,The best and easiest grammar reference,this book tells you about how to use proper english.You can actually do the activities that are about what you learned so far.It gives you alot of details that help you understand more.Read this book and find out that you have made a big difference in your grammar.
3,"great stuff, but a little dry","The book is logically organized and has many good examples. It is quite comprehensive and technical in nature, but reading it can be a little dry when compared with books such as the ""painless grammar""."
3,gettin' a good grammar guide,"I ordered this book on recommendation from my Voice Over coach - to learn the parts of language better. This seems to offer a nicely clear explanation, which is useful even for this editor with 15 years experience."
4,it is good,it is good to study english for international student.it is of conveniently portable size. I am so satisfied. thanks
4,Just wish it wasn't so transparent,"Shipped in a plastic wrapping. No bleeding of the colors, the polyester fabric feels cheap - but what do you really expect with a $5 flag that's 3 by 5 feet? It's exactly what I was looking for, a cheap Union Jack to hang up in my dorm room! Stitching along the edges is very strong.Overall a very good purchase, my only qualm being that I wish it wasn't so easy to see through the cloth."
5,amazon needs to adjust its shipping estimates,"I don't know where Amazon gets its date and shipping estimates from.I ordered this on 12/1/12 and got it on 12/11/12 not after Christmas like Amazontried to tell me. Seems like an attempt to push faster and more expensive shipping rates on people.Cant speak for the quality of the Flags, they are gifts and I didn't open them, buta cursory inspection they look fine from the outside of the packages."
5,british flag,I needed this flag for my Preschool class we were doing Worlds Fair and our country was England.I was very pleased with my flag! I love Amazon!
1,JUNK!!!!!!!,"What a piece of JUNK! The flag was misshapen & the red is bleeding onto the white in two areas. I emailed the seller twice & got no response. Called & had to leave a voicemail & still have not been contacted. Socal Flags claims ""If you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, please contact us at SoCalFlags@gmail.com for a Return Authorization Number within 30 days of purchase. We will accept returns for any reason and there is never a restocking fee. Once you receive an RMA number you can mail your flag(s) back to us"". I've been trying since April 25th (two full weeks now---HALF the time I'm ""allowed"" to get my money back) & cannot get through to these people!!!HORRIBLE customer service & hideous product. All this mess for five lousy bucks. You may as well flush your money down the toilet."
4,Awesome!,"I ordered this flag for my Punk! England cosplay and also to hang up on my wall afterward. It came ten days early! Was much better than I expected, I was thinking it would be really crappy and have the color bleeding together not at all. The fabric is kinda plasticky not like clothe but still it going to work awesome! Thank you guys!"
5,Awesome product at an amazing price!,I was so happy to find exactly what I was looking for at an amazing price! The entire transaction was very pleasant and it shipped super quickly!
1,Poor quality for outside use.,"The listing claims this flag is for indoor or outdoor use. It is not.Firstly, the hole in the grommet for attaching the flag is too large for any standard size flag hardware.Secondly, after just 4 days of flying this flag in only low breezy conditions it has torn the grommet clean out.Its is OK for indoor draping, but a waste of time for flying. Given the fact that one typically wants to fly a flag, it fails on such a fundamental level that I have to laugh at the sheer cheek of this item."
3,Printed not stitched,"Needed a union jack for the royal wedding festivities. This flag is printed not stitched from separately dyed pieces. However it was reasonably priced for what I wanted. As long as you expectations are in line, a reasonable value."
5,Nice decoration!,This flag is a lot bigger than I thought. It's an awesome decoration! It's also very well made. I'm pretty pleased with it. :D
5,Psyche's message relates to us all,"Jacquelyn Small outdid herself with this, her latest, book! Starting out with the love story of Psyche and Eros, she translates the myth into every human's story. I was most impressed with the principles of soul psychology that Jacquie expounded upon as universal ""seeds"" for living a conscious life. The tasks of Psyche have never been this capably and beautifully expressed. She has presented them as being absolutely relevant to us all. This is a book that you will want to refer back to again and again. A definite ""must read""!"
2,"""A bit of musicality, please!!!!""","This recording of Brahm's 1st Symphony is musical garbage. George Szell was well known and critized for his precision. When dealing with classical greats like Mozart and Haydn, George Szell is one of the first conductors I seek after. I recommend his recordings of Mozart's 39th, 40th, and 41st. But!!! George Szell's abilities as a Romantic Period conductor (Brahms!) are lacking in the highest degree. Listening to this recording is like having to look at van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" painted with nothing but straight lines. As for BOXED SETs of the Brahm's Symphonies, Otto Klemperer's recording comes with my highest recommendations. Otto Klemperer KNEW the work of Brahms like few else. He even chided himself for writing pieces that sounded more like Brahms than like Klemperer. His recording of the Brahms Symphonies is available on EMI Classic's 'Great Recordings of the Century' label."
4,Good value,"I really like this product. These are my second pair of this type, and they are great value for the price."
3,Great looking shoe...,"but too narrow for my foot. Another pair by the same maker was too narrow as well, so it must be their style foot last, unfortunately for me."
5,Addidas SuperNova Trail Shoes,"Very good trail shoes. Light, well cushioned neutral shoe. Addidas has made this shoe for some time now and with each update to it they have improved it. Great shoe value for the advid runner."
2,"Um, who is Nika Hoffmann?","And why should I care what she thinks? I live in LA too. Oh well. Hey, if you want to read some good novels about wizards and stuff-- check out the books by Diane Duane. They rock. Magyck and Flyte are also amazing reads."
1,"Creepy book, not my cup of tea.","When I saw the blurb on the front cover from someone I've never heard of -- looks like ""Nika Hoffman"" may be a friend of the author's, or even the publisher -- I thought, oh no, this is sad, I don't think this publisher knows what he is doing. I don't know what the publisher was thinking, using a blurb by some obscure person 99.99% of the readers have never heard of on the cover. Whatever. I just don't care what ""Nika Hoffman"" thinks about this or any other book. Then I read the first chapter. it's all I could stomach. In one word? Creepy. It's not my cup of tea at all. I just can't waste my time on such a creepy book, when there are so many better novels out there."
5,Excellent buy,Good purchase. It arrived exactly as stated and works perfectly. I would certainly buy from this vendor again. No cancerns at all.
2,Difficult to turn on.,"OK, I am naive in the way of modern devices but I could not figure out how to turn it on. I unscrewed and/or tried turning every apparently turnable secion, got the battery and the lightbulb out, the lantern stand to work, but never ON. When a friend showed me how, I was very disappointed in the product. I bought it for emergency use, and I think the on/off is a bit too obscure. Never had any trouble with other flashlights, including those where you turn the head a little. The design is beautiful and the functions great. But most of all, I wish they had given on/off description in the listing - I would have known not to buy it."
2,Maybe the true solution is an extension from 4 credits to 8.,"This text is not only voluminous, it is quite dense. While it looks and feels as exciting as Evidence, when you turn the pages, it has a tendency to bore. Needs more case law and less editorial bashing of both students and advocates. xoxo Snuffy"
4,We love it so much we've bought two!,This is an excellent desk light. The natural sunlight it produces is perfect for checking the colors in your digital photographs and prints. It is easier on the eyes for reading and sewing. The lamp is a pleasure. We bought one as a test and like it so much we bought a second lamp. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the built-in telephone jacks are a waste and detract slightly from the lamp's appearance.
2,This is your basic fluorescent light,"This might be an excellent desk lamp for some needs. However, no where does the advertisement say that this is, for all intents and purposes, a fluorescent lamp. Same type of light I had in college 20 years ago, only a lot more expensive. Forgive my ignorance, but when I read 'replicates the wavelengths of natural daylight indoors' I tend to think of the halogen lamps I have used lately. Not a overpowering, bright white fluorescent light, which, in my opinion, should be no where near a computer LCD or monitor. ..."
3,Good except for omitted measures,"There is no doubt that the widely loved Symphony No. 5 is performed extremely well. With first rate musicians and conductor, the emotional work lives up to its masterpiece reputation. The Serenade for Strings is another brilliant piece, but the edition on this CD lacks the written-out repeat of the Allegro Moderato (roughly 120 measures). Similarly, in the Finale, there are 235 measures missing! These omissions would add a good ten minutes to the Serenade. Music buyers should purchase this CD for the Symphony No. 5 and look for a better edition of the Serenade for Strings."
3,The future is here now!,"I literally could not put this book down until I was finished. The Scientific community has been my life and this book has the Scientists of the world salivating. It was a pleasure reading ""fiction"" that is very very close to future reality. A complete mystery with a shocking and pleasant end."
3,It is called fiction isn't it?,"I'd call the book okay, but not much more. There is basically an interesting story plot, but the characters mostly seem artificial and wooden (couldn't use frozen could I?) If it weren't a local guy, I would have passed on it"
1,not what you think,"I bought this on the 20 and I was training my pitbull with it ,it seemed to work while he was still on the leash and after 4 days I took the leash off and haven't seen my dog since I loved my dog and purchased this at petsmart and had to contact seller to get a refund since the dog took the collar I am out $330.00 Plus a 2 year old best friend the collar does shock him after he leaves but only for 30 seconds"
1,return item,I have a small dog and was afraid that he would get away and go into the street.I have friends that told me to send this item back because it did not work with his bulldogs.So I return item before I open the package. Please refund my money back on my credit card. Thank you.
4,The music samples are not Cocteau Twins...,"I realized as I was going through all the review, and found this to be one of their only albums providing music samples, that the songs playing are not the right band. Look at your media player, I think it's the Motels. One of my favorite songs by Cocteau Twins is Sultitan Itan, so I wanted to hear the sample, only to be shocked when I heard what came out of my speakers. Don't let this determine your opinion of their sound..."
1,No Parts,"This was an excellent product. Unfortunately, it or any of its repair parts are no longer offered for sale in the U.S."
4,"We're not scaremongering, this is really happening","Personally speaking, i'm a HUGE radiohead fan. I own a ton of their singles, just to get rare b-sides. If you're one of those people who just HAS to get their hands on EVERY radiohead song ever, this is definitely worth the buy. Granted, there's only one new song on the cd, but still worth it. After seeing them live at the Shoreline Amphitheater, I can definitely say this captures that live feel (especially the part where Thom freaks out when he's saying ""ice age coming! ice age coming!"")."
3,"RADIOHEAD Is my favorite band, but...","First, let me say that Radiohead is BY FAR my favorite band, and I've listened to many. The reason I gave this CD only three stars is not because it is bad (the quality of Radiohead's material makes that nearly impossible), but because it could have been MUCH better. How could it have been better? Firstly, I heard the live version of ""The National Anthem"" at the Glastonberry Festival, and it is much better and all-around harder rocking than this much-vaunted version. Secondly, the recording quality is sub-par, which is generally not a huge problem, but Radiohead is a band that cannot be truly appreciated without good recordings. Finally, there is only 8 songs on here, and while ""True Love Waits"" is an appreciated inclusion, there should've been more tracks, especially for the price of admission."
2,"Short, thin, and messy","I didn't like this album much. I am, of course, a huge fan of radiohead but this album was so much less than I expected. The songs seemed to suffer from a lack of fullness (on the whole there are fewer instruments playing the songs than on the studio versions - not that that is necessarily a bad thing but I think in this case it is), and an excess of noise - both from the audience and all the crazy gadgets that radiohead like to use in their music (and this certainly isn't helped by the poor quality of the recording). The album, as other reviewers have pointed out, is also quite short. Well...., actually it isn't all that short - about 40 minutes - but there aren't many tracks on it which is disappointing."
4,A little inconsistent but a very necessary addition,"""The National Anthem"" and ""Everything in it's right place"" are the only tracks here I don't really like. Those aside, You must have this album if you own all the other ones! Definately worth getting for the beautiful ""True Love Waits"" and revised version of ""Like Spinning Plates""."
5,This must be right!,"I am one who only loves live albums when they represent the true musicianship of the band.....This one truly does! I've seen Radiohead live before on this tour, and can say that all the songs here are done(to my liking)better than their original renditions...especially the title song and 'Spinning Plates'. My only questionable critique of this is that it should have been longer and included some of their past great songs, however, those like me who love the direction in which the band is going, will love this......and those who love great live performances will love this."
1,"Holy smelly socks, Batman!","This album sure does suck. Usually I reserve words like ""suck"" for Pearl Jam and Tool, but wow. Radiohead really sucks. I bet Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens could make a better record than this crap and they hate each other more than Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. Buy the soundtrack to Hedwig & the Angry Inch instead. It's way better because I've got an angry inch! Honk honk! Beep beep!"
4,Live & Unadorned,"On Radiohead's previous two albums, Kid A & Amnesiac, the band created sonic landscapes that featured multi-layered sounds. They threw everything snap, crackle and pop they find into creating the sound collage. The eight songs on I Might Be Wrong don't try to recreate their album's counterparts' sound. The band just plays the music with the instruments they've got and it shows they are just as powerful live as in the studio. Lead singer Thom Yorke's beatbox vocal opening to ""The National Anthem"" is powerful and adds a tension to the song before he even utters a verse. In some instances, the band leaves Mr. Yorke out on a ledge with little support. He carries ""Idioteque"" with just sparse drum work and the album's closer, ""True Love Waits"" provides only an acoustic guitar. Mr. Yorke's vocals are the foundation of the band's sound and the live album shows off his wonderful gifts."
5,A Well Documented Revisit to the Summer Concerts,"If you went to any Radiohead shows this summer then you know what my title means. If you missed out, then you can get a taste of what Radiohead is like in concert by taking this CD, getting some huge, very expensive speakers, turning it up to ear deafening levels (but to the point where it is loud and it surrounds you but actually causes you no pain)and just relaxing and you'll get the same effect as the concerts this summer. Obviously, nothing will replace those experiences, however, this is definitely not a bad alternative."
3,Not the Live Radiohead Experience,"I saw Radiohead this summer in Atlanta, and the band's sound was much better than on this recording. Thom's voice sounds strained and made me cringe quite often. The live version of ""Like Spinning Plates"" is cool to hear, but again, Thom's voice is crap on it. The bootleg version of ""True Love Waits"" which has been circling the net for a couple years is better than the one featured here. I was just so disappointed with this release; It is, in my opinion, the worst thing they've ever released. I mean, it's not TERRIBLE . . . it's still amazing the way they can transform such complex studio tracks into viable live versions. Radiohead are still my favorite band ever, but I hope something on the level of ""I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings"" doesn't happen again."
3,Great CD only one thing...,"I personally like Thom's voice live only you actually need to see them live to get the feeling. Also True Love Waits isn't a love song its about during the time the Christian chruch sent out messages to not let kids lose their virginity when they're not married the chruch made the slogan ""True Love Waits"" Get it?"
3,Earth to Thom. Earth to Thom.,"Okay, don't get me wrong, I LOVE RADIOHEAD. I do, honest. Seriously. But why are they punishing us?"
4,Hanging with for now,"This CD, like virtually everything Radiohead, requires a bit of an investment by the listener at first. It didn't grab me by the throat, but then after listening a couple of times one starts to become amazed at what Radiohead are bringing to the live shows.It struck me several times while listening how tight they are as a band and how simply so much of the dense material from Kid/Amnesiac breaks down. They do some really amazing things here, it's nice to have it on disk.Would have liked to have another 5 or 6 tracks, maybe at least a COUPLE from o.k. computer.Here's hoping they start rockin again. Getting real tired of all the electronic mewling and crybaby sketches on the incomprehensable covers."
2,radio my head in,ok. they should NEVER have released this cd. it's not that radiohead isn't good live...they are in fact simply AMAZING live...but their (live) talents cannot be captured in a mass produced cd. it's just not possible. why do I feel like they are being such sell outs?
1,"Sour, discordant and boring","I was lent the entire Radiohead discography. I hardly kept about 10 songs which are indeed quite good : ""Sail to the moon"", ""Nice dream"", ""Creep""... but the rest is a proper disaster. I was appalled by the live stuff : the guy just cannot sing properly unless he is backed by studio effects. He just has no voice, just a dismal creaking off-key whine that just make ears cringe. But apparently not everyone has ears. No to mention very poor melodies for most songs.The fact this band is so popular is not very encouraging. Creaking off-key whine lovers.."
4,worth picking up....,"If you're a serious Radiohead fan, it is imperative you pick this up quick. For two reasons. 'Like Spinning Plates'...an absolutely stunningly beautiful rendition. And of course, 'True Love Waits'..excellent to finally have an 'official' version. I miss the backing electronics on the popular bootleg version but it's still a total joy. The rest of the tracks suffice quite nicely."
4,great live album,"when i first picked up this album about a year and a half ago, i was a little dissapointed to find out that there were only 8 tracks on this album. i don't know why they didn't put in at least another 2 or 3 songs, as they most definitely had the material.....that aside, this really is a terrific live album. the live version of ""everything in its right place"" is VERY different from the album version, so if you are a huge ""kid a"" fan like me you will be pleasantly surprised. i also like how the song ""like spinning plates"" translates onto piano, it sounds fantastic. however, the standout song on this album has to be ""true love waits"". it is a terrific acoustic song that is not available on any other radiohead album.since this album now only costs 9 bucks on amazon, you can't really go wrong, it's a good deal. and although i complain about their only being 8 tracks, the album still exceedes the 40 minute mark, so i guess it's not THAT bad.8.2/10"
4,Rock 'n' roll is not dead,"I never thought that Glenn Hughes and Joe Lynn Turner would follow up the Hughes Turner Project album from last year. But now they have, and I must say that this album, titled ""HTP II"" is nearly as great as the first one. The majority of the songs are solid rock tunes in mid tempo with a perfect blend of the heavy and the melodic. A lot of the songs have a harder approach during the verses and a softer, more melodic chorus - a touch I think is very appealing! This album holds a lot of references to hard rock from the past; for example ""Losing my head"" have a ""Kashmir-sounding-riff"", while ""Time and time again"" reminds of the Rainbow semi ballads. But don't worry, the songs have a lot of originality to them and there's no rip off's. Rock `n' roll is certainly not dead, something this album (along with others, like Deep Purple's ""Bananas"") prove. Highly recommended!"
5,The thing about physical comedy is...,"Before I watched this film I was not sure who Patton Oswalt was. I watch a lot alternative comedy like Mr. Show, David Cross, and I love comedians like Bill Hicks and George Carlin. Patton, Brian, Zach and many others are carrying the torch. This video is without a doubt the very best comedy DVD I have ever seen. I liked this video so much I wouldn't let Netfilx have it back. When I saw the video it could not be purchased anywhere, so I ""lost"" it. I play this video in the background at parties in my, and it is fun to see how many people take time out to listen to comedians like these guys with no context. I always hear the inevitable, ""who is this?"" These comedians are the best on the planet it's great more people can see this DVD now.I liked it beary much."
4,Typhus USBM,"Typhus is a typical US black metal outfit. Profound Blasphemous Proclamation sets a pretty good black metal ambiance in this debut album, but you can hear the extended intros and outros that are just guitar feedback which gets really lazy and tiresome on the second album."
2,"Kind of cheezy, get the Brother PT-1750 instead.","I got this because there was a rebate that made it end up costing (very little). I already had the Brother PT-1750 but at less (money) I figured if nothing else I could give it to the kids. Anyway, the unit seems well built and solid but the tape it prints on is some two part stuff kind of like a stencil. Messy, fuzzy and it doesn't look like it will wear well."
2,Overpriced for capabilities,"Dymo's LetraTag series is cheaper, smaller and has similar capabilities. But for the substantial rebate, this item would be grossly overpriced."
4,"Nice, compact guide",Filled with useful information about Shenzhen and its wares. Practical advice on how to shop and bargain from fashion to antiques.Would have liked more detailed maps though.
5,Evocative,"As an art critic I repsond to both the visual and the written word. And when reading Peter Guttman's ""Worlds to Imagine"" I found myself carried away not only by the exquisite photography of unique destinations but the tone poems of prose that accompanied each location. Brimming with imagery and told in an original voice, the text stands to enhance the sensual experience the photography evokes. Mr. Guttman's eye for detail and story telling are found in both. Soon I was fantasizing trips around the globe, excited by the prospect of discovery and exploration. I recommend this book to anyone who dares to dream."
2,"Low quality, incomplete offering","The software is very, very unstable on this device. It will end up either crashing hard--requiring you to remove the battery pack--or it'll act as if it's working, but not actually take or make any phone calls. Besides, D-Link does not offer a cahrging cradle for this phone, nor a replacement battery pack, nor any way to carry this ""portable"" phone. Although this device demonstrates some promising ideas, any but the hardiest of early adopters would be well advised to wait for a more competent offering."
1,Didn't work with our system,"We had to return ours. We couldn't get this phone to link with our Apple wireless access, nor could we get it to call out, so we couldn't use it as a VOIP phone."
1,No closed captioning,"No closed-captioning on most (all?) of these videos in the series. I was disappointed every time a new series came out still uncaptioned.Without captioning, these videos are USELESS to many hearing-impaired people.Shame on you First Run Films for not captioning these videos."
2,Disappointing,"After hearing Roger Ebert's effusive praise, I decided to buckle up and give the series a try. After watching the first four discs, through 28up, I just couldn't help but feel disappointed. LF was right, what the characters have to say just really *isn't* that interesting, and the interviews are, in my view, rather dry. In addition, the lives the characters lead at this part of the series aren't particularly interesting either. It's a wonderful concept for a documentary series imperfectly realized. It is not for lack of interest in human behavior on my part, I just found myself wanting each disc to be over."
5,Completist happiness,"A facisinating look at the lives of ordinary people. I started watching the series with 35 Up and this collection allows me to go back an time and get more of the back story. My favorites editions are Seven Up, and 28 Up. Since these characters are slightly older than myself - it is like having a magic mirror letting me peer into the future."
3,Good show but no subtitles!,"I have not finished watching it yet and so far mostly agree with other reviewer's positive comments regarding the quality of the content. But I am giving this DVD release 3 stars because of a lack of English subtitles. The characters in the movie are speaking with such thick British accents, making me miss half of what they are saying. It's getting better by 21up (partially due to better sound quality and the fact that the adults speak clearer), but the first two installments (7up and 14up) are very difficult to understand."
5,Review Up Series,"I have not finished it, yet. But, so far it lives up to the claims that everyone made about it. It is a good watch. Very interesting!"
5,"Fantastic movies, so-so DVDs","For the movies themselves: 10 stars.For the DVDs as a product: 1 star.The movies will change your life. There is a reason why Roger Ebert said these films were, ""an inspired, even noble, use of the film medium."" Watch them! The DVDs as a package, however, are bland. They basically contain the movies and nothing else. No commentary, no special features, not even a very good menu.But since there's no alternative to these DVDs, go ahead and buy them. Like I said, they will change your life."
3,"Some brilliant moments, but still leaves me wanting ...","I was really excited to pick up this disc, being a long-time Kozalek fan. Like other people, I had a really difficult time getting into it at first...I've had it for a couple months now and its grown on me nicely, but I still feel that its missing some of the masochisticly romantic magic that can be found Revelation Big Sur, Mistress, Summer Dress, Love Hungry Man, etc.Where the album scores big points is production. Its nice to hear Mark do something thats not so sloppy. The production is clean and the guitars sound great and it works because it never gets in the way of the songs.Oh, and ""Lily & Parrots"" is the best rocker he's ever written."
2,I really wanted to like this...,"I had a tough time listening to this. Mark Kozelek's voice seems to me to be much like Neil Young's, but lacking the melodious quality of Young's voice. You're left with a flat nasality that grates. The music is trance inducing, a drone in the background, neither serving the lyrics nor engaging the listener. After reading the reviews, I realize I'm in the minority here, and I'm glad so many people found enjoyment with this. I wish I were one of them, but all I feel here is a numbness."
2,Uninspired...,"** This review is not aimed at people who may already be fans of this group. It is intended for those who may be unfamiliar with the artist (as I was) and who may unwittingly buy it based on the stellar reviews people have given it here. **I have found the music on this CD to be whiny, monotonous, boring and uninspired.Frankly, I am at a loss to understand the rave reviews people are giving this disc. I listen to virtually every style of music known to human ears, but I am very critical, and I found this release to be mediocre at best."
1,Why do I have to be the bad guy?,"So I was floating out in the Pacific Ocean and I asked my wife for this CD. As soon as it was delivered to the ship, I popped it in and listened. Next track...Next track...Next track. This all sounds the same. Being at sea, opening mail is like Christmas day, and this was like I got a pair of sox instead of a bike. And why is this a double disc? Both CD's are the exact same thing. Could you at least put some kind of effect on the guitar so I could say, ""Hey, this doesn't ALL sound the same."" I dont think Mark Kozelek is trying to gain fans because this album really turned me off to the modern folk american singer/songwriter. Switch it up a bit, big guy. I'd love to hear a some drum and bass thrown in. Did someone say remix? = ) Holla!P.S. I do like three Red House Painters songs."
1,1 star is too much,the lead singers voice is too whinny and sad to listen to. The band is boring in their playing technique. The music is not good at all.
4,Beautiful Music,"I recently bought this CD after hearing the song ""Carry Me Ohio"" on satellite radio. I was immediately drawn to the melancholy, almost haunting vocals. And the music was such an appropriate addition. After listening to the rest of the CD I have concluded that it's an absolute keeper. For the most part, all of the music has that mellow, kind of sad quality mentioned above. There is at least one completely instrumental song to give the entire composition some variety. I wouldn't say that the singer has an outstanding voice, but it is definitely adequate. And besides, the music is really well put together. The CD I bought actually has two discs, the second one having some alternate versions of songs from the first one."
4,From someone unfamiliar with Red House Painters,"I came to this album after hearing the opener on college radio (""Glenn Tipton"") so I had no preconceptions or points of comparison with other works of Mark Kozalek. I am not going to use flowery adjectives, I'll just say this album is one that I have played incessantly ever since. Songs like ""Glenn Tipton"", ""Gentle Moon"", ""Last Tide"", and ""Carry Me Ohio"" just never get tired for me. The vocals, guitar and overall mood and feel of the album are quite unique. I took one star off for the last third of the album which I think loses some of its focus. But overall, easily one of the best albums of 2003."
5,Very original design,This necklace is intricate in design. I receive many compliments on it every time I wear it. Works casually or for dress.
5,4-C Cell Maglite,"My husband had one of these for years! Then someone stole it. All he was ever able to find to replace it is the 3 and 4 ""D"" Cell Maglite. Until I found this one! He is definitely happy to have this light back in his possession. Said it fits his hand better than the ""D"" Cell lights."
4,Great no-need-to-carry-in-person flashlight,"Mine were ordered with led bulbs, which extend battery life a lot. That is useful in case there is need to search for someone lost. C-batteries don't make it excessively heavy, though so far haven't had to carry mine for hours. I got the idea from a magazine article by Massad Ayoob."
4,There is only one flashlight - Maglite,"If you are only allow to have one flashlight in your home, make it a Maglite. It may not be the brightest flashlight in the market; but it'll do just fine within a 150 feet. Wish I could get a 6 c cell Maglite."
3,*** Read Before Purchase ***,"I believe the UPS is an essential part of protecting your PC investment. This model has given me some trouble. I have not tried to contact the service department from APC yet so I am not sure if it is able to be adjusted. The problem is that the battery kicks on and off about 40 to 50 times a day, just briefly for a second or two. It's really annoying because it clicks and a message appears every time it happens. The program says it is due to ""background noise"" and we have the detection level set as low as possible. I would not suggest purchasing this model."
4,Good basic Home Office UPS,"My computers are on all the time for quick response to my clients needs, on the rare occasion that we lose power, this has kept us up and running for the momentary power lose that we sometimes suffer. This is the second generation of the UPS we've used all along and no problems."
3,Lasted 30 months,"It was good while it lasted; however, I was expecting more than two and a half years. This was with a normal computer load and an average of 1-2 power outages and a handful of brownouts a year."
5,Great bargain at the time,I bought 2 of these a while back in Oct. 2007 directly through amazon and it was much cheaper then. I paid less than eighty bucks for two. Now it seems hard to get one for that price. They seem to be working fine. You can recycle them directly with APC when the battery does go bad.
4,Battery Backup for desktop computer,"This battery backup installed easily and works great keeping my computer from being affected by surges, temporary power flashes or power outages."
4,Purchased two,"Purchased two of these. The one on my husband's is working great, mine works fine but keeps going off so had to set it differently. Mine says only 11 minutes on it and hubby's is 45 minutes. Can't imagine why there is such a difference. Send them a note this morning to see if they have a solution."
5,I'd purchase again...,"I've had it four weeks and it has kicked on 12 times. I use it for my pc and cable modem. I have the wireless router and printer plugged into the the non-backup outlets.I really like that I can check out the ""performance."" Surprisingly, half of the usage is due to ""electrical noise"" that I didn't even know was an issue."
4,APC is quality,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBG51W/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleCnet and Consumer Reports both give APC high marks. I always check those 2 sources before I buy anything electronic.Except for having to crawl around on the floor, the units were easy to install. Read the directions.Florida power is notorious. These units have already justified their purchase price."
5,Does just what I need it to,"I bought this mainly because sometimes the power will just go out for a second or a few minutes. I have my tower, LCD monitor, wireless router, modem, and a cordless phone connected to it. Works great so far, definitely recommended if you need it for similar needs."
4,this is the one that converted me...,"The title song of this album (""Onna no Magokoro"") is the song that first won me over to Fuji Ayako (last name first in Japanese). This album will give you a nice taste of traditional Japanese Enka style music, except I wouldn't say that Fuji Ayako is really of the traditional genre. I'm from the U.S., but I'm a big Fuji Ayako fan and have attended several of her concerts in Japan. I don't know how well known she is in the U.S. and Europe, but I suspect some of you over there might like her music, especially if you've any ties to Japan. Buy this album (or ""Itoshii Hito He"") and find out!"
3,"Moody, ethereal tunes from Brian Dunn and Co.","(3 and 1/2 stars) Mark Kozalek's label Badman likes album art that's mainly black-and-white pictures of stark, weathered landscapes. The music on Badman CDs is similarly stark, usually focusing on a singer with limited accompaniment. In the case of the Clairvoyants, the typical song has singer (and songwriter) Brian Dunn's intimate vocals up front, often accompanied only by his own guitar and some subdued bass notes from Joe McMahon. Dunn has a soft tenor of British male folk singer stock (Donovan, Drake, etc.), and his singing sometimes sounds more like he's humming. The tunes Brian wrote are mostly rather lovely in a quiet and downbeat kind of way, but nothing really stuck with me. There's no song from Your New Boundaries that I would put on a mix tape for a friend."
4,Didn't come with exterior gold plating.,"The exterior appearance of the one I received was not the same as what's on the item's page. Rather than exterior gold plating, it was gray. Hopefully the actual connections are gold, but there's no way for me to tell for sure. It's certainly compact, though, and it fit well and works so far."
1,never got nope not at all,I never receved the book nope not yet been waiting for it I requested it be sent priorty with proof of delivery so it may be tracked I said I would pay the differnace. nope never got it not at all
4,A must buy for player who use the Pirc Defense,"This book is a must buy for tournament players who play the Pirc. Having gone through parts of this book I found the use to be typical for standard opening books. Although you have an obligitory introduction to each section that involves text, I found the conclusions to be fair, honest and reasonably thorough. What set the book apart from the rest is that it is from John Nunn. I feel that I can trust his opinions given his past work. It would have been nice and indeed enlightning, if John Nunn put in more text."
1,TERRIBLE RECORDING!,"I thought this had promise since it's an SACD which usually sounds good along with winning the Grammy Award for the best Children's Spoken Word Recording of 2003 when it was released. It also has Sophia Loren narrating along with Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev. So you'd think that this would be an exceptional recording but it isn't the case here. This is one of the worst SACD recordings that I've ever heard. The digital haze completely blurs the sound. Don't waste your money on this bad recording. Instead get the much better sounding DVD-Audio disc with higher resolution, and detail of the famous narration done by Boris Karloff, and played by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra that includes the Lt. Kije Suite and was originally released on Vanguard records in 1957."
4,Solid product,I am a long time Mag-Lite user; I find the quality of the manufacturing to be very good; I have never had to replace a Mag-lite I have purchased. This one was purchased as a gift for someone going abroad.
3,"Review of ""Take Joy!""","This book is about all things Christmas. Here you will come across thoughts, stories, poems, carols and legends related to this celebration. As a matter of fact, this is how the chapters of the book are organized plus an ending section on Tasha Tudor's unique perspective on this traditional holiday. This last section covers the whole gamut, ranging from cookies to marionettes.I think that anyone wishing to enhance his or her Christmas experience will find this book interesting. The stories are from sources such as Saint Luke and O. Henry. The carols have the scores and the lyrics. The final chapter describes stuff like the gingerbread castle and the birds' Christmas. It seems to me all of this will factor in making Christmas even more fun, specially for the children."
2,This is one you can skip with no great loss.,"I should have been forewarned by the title and name of the co-author (Lt. Ray Biondi). I said when I started that Biondi's stuff is ghosted. After I got into the book, I decided that Biondi may really have put pen to page. This book reads altogether too much like an official police report and falls into the ""trap,""of too many ""true crime"" stories. It is a major story that is poorly presented."
5,Lost in the Barrens or Two Against the North,"This is a tale of adventure, growing up, making bad decisions and living with the consequenses, but most of all friendship.Jamie and Awasin want an adventure into the Arctic, but don't count on having to do it alone. Together they learn from each other how to survive in very brutal conditions. The story contains great descriptions of survival techniques and of the Arctic wilderness and the creatures that survive there.I first read this book under the title ""Two Against the North"", back in the 1970's. I found it had been re issued under this current name when I was searching for it for my nephews. If your reader is interested with Gary Paulson(Hatchet,etc) or Jean Craighead George (My Side of the Mountain,etc) They will certainly enjoy this as well."
2,this book has its moments but needs work,i feel that in the beginning this book began well but as it continued it adventure packed lines began to fade away. I dont reccomend this book to anyone who wants to be entertained by action packed sequences.
4,"Solidly made, but NOT designed for LED Mini-Mags","This item is solidly made, but is too short to fit the LED AA Mini Maglite. This second detail should have been made apparent in the product description and on the packaging of the holster. Other than this one issue, it would be nice if this were the default holster that accompanied all regular Mini AA Maglites, especially with the flap that covers and holds the flashlight in the holster. If this holster came in a length long enough to accomodate a LED AA Mini Maglite, the world would be a better place."
5,"Billy Joel meets the Fugs in Oak Ridge, Tennessee!","I enjoyed the music and lyrics very much, just like one enjoys a gathering of friends having a conversation about life, the good, the bad and the ugly. I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't a bit apprehensive. I'm getting too old and tired to be brooding. But the Bohemian Hillbillies' treatment of the subject of death is quite authentic, non-jarring, thoughtful, smile-inducing, and much more. I'm not an artist, musical or otherwise, just a consumer of art. I like what I like and I know why. I like people communicating. The Bohemian ones are some mighty smart hillbillies! I love the subtleties. At one point I chuckled at the emerging thought: Billy Joel meets the Fugs! Definitely ""roots"", in my opinion."
4,History Repeats,"Although Niebuhr writes at the time that fear of communism dominated the national stage, he presents a larger historic prism through which we can look at ourselves today. Terrorism, Islam and our sense of being in the right are dwarfed by Niebuhr's larger world vision. The analogy of the communist threat to our current fears is striking. His ability to place our culture and self perception into a larger context grounded in Christian/religious context causes one to examine our national and global self perceptions in a way that allows for a more complete world vision along with our place in it."
2,Niebuhr is overrated - theology not philosophy,"The fascination of public figures with Niebuhr is a mystery. Both Bacevich and Obama are Christians. This has to have something to do with their particular admiration. Niebuhr's take on America's role in the world was deep, but then so is Bacevich's and hopefully, Obama's.Beyond that, though, you won't get a lot of philosophical depth here, as opposed to other liberal big thinkers such as Rorty. You get the faithful's answer to everything -inscrutable religious hokum that is anathema to non-believers.Read Bacevich instead."
4,i know enough,"The ideas of NieThe Irony of American Historybuhr are discusssed at length in the book I purchased, authored by Andrew Bicevich."
3,An Adequate Grande Duchesse,"Because I had enjoyed La Belle Helene so much and because I had the French CD version of Duchesse (with Crespin) I felt this had to be a winner. Many years ago I saw an English language version; surprisingly I found I enjoyed it immensely even though French operetta like its German and Austrian equivalent don't travel well when translated, Well, the version under consideration didn't travel well to this auditor. Aside from the production which looked ""low rent"", Pelly's direction was of the ""wink wink nudge nudge"" school. Everything was underlined, exaggerated, and grotesque. I adore Lott but she was directed to overdo all her gestures and schticks. When it came to simply singing, I have no criticism, but there is a lot of dialogue and little inspiration or imagination employed.I hate to be negative, but I frankly doubt whether I will play this DVD very often."
3,a tad too buffo,"Most of the reviewers here find this one a great first opera to show friends. It is a little over the top with clownishness; but you know, so was I Love Lucy, or The Honeymooners. And that, perhaps is what most find highly entertaining or amusing, and thus it becomes a nice escape from drudgery. Also, I have been so thrilled and surprised by the likes of Donizetti, Bellini, Rossini, and some more rare composers, that this only seems flippant by comparison. It does contain good music and great vocals; and some pretty impressive choreography."
4,My camera review,Its a good camera and probably the best for its price. i got it for around 100$. It takes great pictures although i would have liked to have option of taking widescreen pictures at 8 MP. It can shoot a decent video and probably the videos are best suited for the purpose i needed them ie to upload them to youtube and i dont even have to convert them. just select and upload although they are not good to watch at home or on tv. I bought white glazed color which although is as attractive as it should be just like apple white products although now i think i would rather buy the pink color.
3,Very good stair cleaner.....,"This Dirt Devil hand vac does a VERY IMPRESSIVE job on carpeted stairs, is fairly affordable, and the tools are a nice addition, however its fairly noisy, its a heavy little guy, the bags fill up quickly, and although the tools are nice the vacuum is very shy on suction. I whould recommend this for stair or furniture cleaning only because of its week suction, but I guess I shouldn't expect impressive suction from a little 3.0 amp hand vac :-)"
5,So easy!,"I received this yesterday, and made a dinner requiring ground beef just so I could try it out! Even thought the ground beef I had was the cheapest I could find, this tool did an amazing job of breaking the beef apart. When it was almost all browned, I chopped it again with this, and the meat was broken into tiny little particles! This is so much easier to use than a spatula, wooden spoon or fork! And the results were awesome! I love that I could just throw it in the dishwasher and it is clean again! Definitely worth the small amount of money this costs! I might just buy a few more for family!"
5,love it!,This does just what I wanted it to do. It chops the ground beef into small bite sized pieces. Can't wait to try it on ground sausage!
4,Handy gadget,This is a handy gadget. I used it to chop and stir ground beef. It's sturdy and not made of the flimsy plastic and it's easy the clean.
4,Nice gadget,"I used this for mashing tomatoes the last time I made spaghetti sauce. Didn't use hamburger, but it would work well for that also."
3,Works great,My wife has wanted one of these for a long time. It works great for chopping up hamburger or mashed potatoes. Seems expensive for what you get.
5,Chopstir,"This product is great! I use it to scramble meat. If you're not from the south then you won't understand what that means. Basically, it chops and stirs hamberger meat without scratching non-stick cookware. I'm sure it has many more uses - that's just how I use it. I have even give it to kitchen savy friends as a gift and they love it. It is a sturdy utensil and very inexpensive. You've got to try it. I think you'll love it too.Harold Imports Chopstir"
4,Handy,This tool really helps break up ground meat while browning. I would have given it 5 stars but I still have to use a spoon or fork to turn the meat over to ensure browning on all sides. That is a minor inconvenience but an inconvenience just the same
3,"chopstir works pretty well, just not as good as i had expected",my chopstir arrived in the mail in a torn package with dirt all over it.this was my first disappointment. the utensil was chipped and worn down on part of it due to the torn packaging.so it did not work as well as it should because it was damaged.it should not have been shipped in a plastic envelope. it should have been shipped in a box so as not to get damaged.
4,Great for chopping up ground beef,"I first saw this nifty kitchen gadget demonstrated at a friend's Pampered Chef party. I didn't buy it at that time because that one was a bit pricey, plus I really didn't have room for another utensil. However, when I saw this one in a kitchen shop a couple of years later, I bought it. It works GREAT for chopping up ground beef, which we consume weekly on taco night. The only disadvantages of the utensil are that it is yet another gadget we need to squeeze in our already full drawers, plus it is an extra dish to wash because I use it in addition to the spatula spoon that I would otherwise use to chop and serve. In addition, it's a little difficult to clean up because the hamburger gets in its creases. But as far as chopping up ground beef, it works GREAT. Would recommend."
5,Does what you want,This product is so simple it does exactly what you want it to do. That's breaking up lumps of minced beef that have been defrosted.
5,Perfect for ground meat!,"Cheaper than the pampered chef version, but works great! Breaks up meat nicely. No more annoying chunks.Sturdy and comfortable handle. So glad I got this because I hate trying to break up ground meat with a spatula."
5,great product,"save tons of time when making sloppy joes, tacos or anything else that needs ground beef/turkey"
4,Clamps,Quality of these clamps is pretty good. Much larger in person. Any curve in the hose and the clamps are a little difficult to keep the sections together. A little patience and all is well!
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK,"THIS IDIOT PREACHES MARXISM PRETENDING THAT PELOSI WASN'T GIVING OBAMA ALL HE WANT'S SHE WOULD HAVE YOU SURRENDER YOU LIBERTY AT THE DROP OF A HAT. SHE PRETENDS AS IF THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES DIDN'T SHOW UP IN 09 AND THROW ALMOST ALL THE DEMOCRATS OUT OF OFFICE. SHE PRETENDS AS IF HEALTH CARE WAS NEVER PASSES, AS IF THE STIMULUS WAS NEVER PASSED, THE KIND OF PROPAGANDA SHE SPEWS IS DANGEROUS DON'T FALL FOR IT"
3,"Compact, cute, but a bit finicky.","I love the size and design of this little flash light which gives off a decent amount of light. But the bulb was a bit finicky and would not always turn on. Also, because the head is so small, it's not easy to balance the light in ""candle mode"", unless you put it on a flat even surface. Not so functional inside a tent."
4,"Don't get me wrong, the MiniMag's great...","I used a MiniMag AA for years. It's just that there's a better product out there - the Pelican Versabrite II. It looks like a pager with a flashlight head stuck on top on a pivot. The body has clips to attach to a belt or hat brim for hands-free use...or you can just put it in your shirt pocket with the head protruding.It lacks the beam focus feature of the Maglite, but otherwise is just as bright and more useful - I have a professional use for a small, bright light (the hands-free use is important when you have to take notes at night), and the Pelican is better enough to justify the extra two dollars or so.I don't have any connection with Pelican or anyone who sells their products, I just think they make a superior double-AA cell flashlight..."
3,"a lost but critical area of history, even for middle schoolers","this was a great book for middle school, and I wish I could get the whole series for my school. The history of science and invention is often glossed over, or ignored, but it fact its influence of the political and military side is huge. Huff's use of age appropriate language and concrete examples allowed the students and teachers to understand the topics and make connections to their more traditional curriculum. It also helped them see connections between classes like science and history in ways they normally would not."
3,A nice coffee-table item...,"I got this book as present from the owner of one the resorts featured by Ypma. Its true that a picture can paint a thousand word. This book is a beautiful compilation of some of the most breathtaking locations in the world. Some of the visuals also provide interior-decorating ideas. After all, the writer is founder of the award-winning Interior Architecture and creator of the best-selling World Design series. If I'm an owner of a resort, I'd want him to feature my property the way he does it here. The places featured may offer 'out-of-this -world luxury' but ONLY if one can afford it. If paradise is the aim in every respect, there are many more beautiful and 'Highly Individual Places' that are more accessible. I would not recommend this book as the ultimate vacation guide, only the perfect coffee-table item."
3,Pretty good but could be a lot better,"This book profiles around 45 luxury hotels throughout the world. Some of the hotels featured include Vatulele in Fiji, Pangkor Laut in Malaysia and Soneva Fushi in the Maldives. Due to the format of the book, I found the pictures to be small. Some entries include only 4 pictures of the hotel which really is not enough. Overall, it is ok. Anyone interested in this type of book should check out The Hotel Book: Great Escapes series by Taschen. This series focuses on luxury hotels in Asia, Africa, and Europe and the pictures are outstanding."
2,The cover looks great but.....,The book is basically a gathering of exotic hotel panflets that are pasted in a book that delivers few pictures and fewer information on the hotels. All the places in the book are great but it leaves you longing for much more info and even more pictures..not very helpful trip planner. PS- It looks like someone had a great free vacation all around the world and all he got was this stupid book.....sorry but its true!
4,Informative,I thought this book gives you a tremendous amount of information. However I took a star off my rating because I think it gives a little to much to stomach per chapter. Overall it is a great Intro to Business text book.
1,Very stupid,"This book reinforces the stereotypes people who major in business being stupid. It is very basic, but it takes too many pages to describes those basic concepts, too many examples, too many case studies, no meat. It lacks an analytic approach and if you have to buy this it's because you chose a stupid class or your teacher is an idiot."
1,HUGE disappointment!,"I'm a big enought fan of Kenny Vance and the Planotones to own ALL of their CDs. I guess it was too good to be true that they they had a concert DVD up to the same high standards as their audio recordings. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the audio and video quality of this DVD are amateurish at best, and a great disservice to Kenny Vance and the Planotones, as well as to their loyal fans like me. To be more specific, it sometimes seemed to me that this DVD was recorded using nothing more than a couple of handheld consumer camcorders! I hope that Kenny Vance and the Planotones will produce a first class concert DVD to make up for this HUGE disappointment."
1,Atrocious Audio Quality,"I agree with ""MacMyst."" This DVD is a great disappointment. The audio quality of the concert is utterly horrid. It is difficult enough to detect which songs are being performed, much less to hear their words. I was very much looking forward to this concert, but could not proceed beyond the first several minutes, during which my only ability to determine which songs were being performed came from the listing on the DVD box. This DVD is unlistenable."
2,Vocal Sound Disappointing,"Shame on Alpha New Cinema for producing Kenny Vance & The Planotones Live DVD for the audio recordings. It is as if they put a microphone in the middle of the room while the group performed. Unless you have some audio enhancement software you will be disappointed with the overall vocal sound quality. DVD was played on desktop computer, laptop computer and combination TV/DVD - all with the same poor audio sound quality.Play LOOKING FOR AN ECHO from the Doo Wop Vocal Group Greats DVD and compare it to this DVD. No comparison at all!"
5,"Publishers: reprint this book, your audience is out there","I was amazed to see that this book has the same resonance for other readers that it has for me. Publishers, listen up: there's a lot of baby boomers out here who want to purchase this book for our daughters, nieces, or even for ourselves."
5,Excellent quality for the price!,"I got these to replace some blown speakers in a car I just purchased. I honestly was not expecting much out of these speakers given the brand name and the price. I was pleasently suprised. They are by no means high end speakers, but they sound really good and get pretty loud with out distortion. I was very impressed they sounded so good for the price. Would recommend for anyone who is looking for a good cheap speaker."
3,Who knew the women's movement was so blandly convoluted,"I was assigned this book as reading for a US history course at my university. While I don't consider myself a feminist exactly, I definitely admire the women who led the initial and second wave movements that helped shape the freedoms I have as a woman today. Unfortunately, the author's writing style is so wordy and essay-like, that your focus is often pulled away from the inspiring nature of what you're reading."
1,Dont believe the hype,"Julie Frost is not what the others make her out to be. She is way too selfish to be a successful singer without a karaoke soundtrack. She is not even comparable to Fiona Apple, Julie is about as deep as a puddle. Do yourself a favor and get Fiona's record it is so much better than anything Julie could ever do. Let's face it, Julie is a wedding singer, nothing more, nothing less, she just wishes she was more..... not"
2,it makes no sense......,"...to have episodes 1-4 on one dvd and 6-9 on the other dvd,what happened to episode #5? sorry like the armada seriesI'm going to wait for a box set of this before even thinking about getting this series,the dvds for energon and armada makes no sense,I will say that energon is slightly better than armada but not much better,at least the animation is better..."
5,Transformers Energon the Return of Megatron!,"Transformers Energon:The Return of Megatron is a great DVD! This DVD set contains the episodes that re-introduces Megatron into the Transformers Energon series as Energon Megatron! This episodes in this set are Megatron's Ressurection, Megatron's Raid, StarScream the Mysterious Mercenary, and the Battle on the Astriod Belt. These Transformers episodes are really good because they combine both CGI and Japanese Anime for a Transformers cartoon. I like the Japanese animation in this series a-lot. Megatron and Starscream return form the previous series, Transformers: Armada. They are both as villianous as they ever were! I highly Recommend this Transformers Energon DVD! A+"
2,Seaton pro fascist?,"Col Seaton, comes across as pro Nazi. he refers to Hitler as the Fuhrer, but Stalin as the Soviet dictator.The Germans as the Germans (not Nazis)but the Russians are frequently called Bolsheviks.Talks of Russian atrocities but not Nazi ones, maybe all those stories of deportment Slave labor, the murder of Jews in the Ukraine are all false?"
1,Dont buy,Get yourself the actually manual from Chrysler...you can get it on CD on ebay for like 35 bucks. this manual is horrible. It covers about 50 different cars...not just 71-4 RR/GTX/Satelitte....trust me...dont buy it
3,workout video,"this video is ok. not what i was looking for but i did get a pretty good core workout out of it. i was after a zumba type workout. this has some zumba moves, its simple and easy to follow. just not zumba."
1,Wrong size loop for LED C cell Maglite,Title says it all. The flashlight falls right through. Sent back for credit. Also ring appears to be plastic and a very cheap look and feel.
1,doesn't fit,"Claims it fits the C-cell Maglite, it doesn't. Giving it to a buddy who works security with a manly D-cell Maglite."
2,Disappointing quality,The belt holder arrived secured inside it's plastic packaging. I removed the belt holder and the revet holding the snap was not properly clinched and the snap failed on the first attempt to open it. I'll try and reclinch the revet to salvage the investment. It's not worth returning to Amazon for a refund.
3,"It's just a Maglite holder, what do you want?","It snaps on to your belt and holds your Maglite or probably many other brands of flashlights. I am not sure why they offer a differnt holder for the different sizes of Maglites, but I was almost careless enough to buy the wrong size. I'm sure the engineering would have been just fine for any Maglite, but if you want this product, double check that your belt holder matches the size of Maglite you own or are purchasing."
5,Extraordinary insight into post-war El Salvador,"Kathleen Hayes opened my eyes to the life of women (and men) in El Salvador. Based on TV, my only images of this country were of soldiers and death. She introduces us to a group of women who try to put their lives into perspective through their faith, while living in an impovrished land with strongly masculine values.While focusing on a small group of Baptist women, telling their stories in their own words with analysis by Hayes, this book truly tells the story of all Salvadorans. Highly recommended for those interested in learning about the real Central America."
2,"Ok, but light on meat",Ray Vander Laan is an amazing teacher. His Dust of the Rabbi is one of the best series I've ever heard.This one is a little light on meat and details. I bought the DVD and can say there was one good lesson on it. The rest was a couple small tidbit factoids and some long praise-song montages. Not really what I was expecting.
5,lost and found,"This is one this things lost/misplaced when we moved. I am so pleased to have it again and we watch it a few times a year, every year."
1,A7 Tornado..junk!,I was given one of these A7 tornado duct fan jets as a gift for xmas...It was to be a good trainer as it only has tail and rudder controls.....I flew this peice of crap twice...it crashed both times..(yes due to my inexperience) but to have this thing break in half after 2 30 second flights (pronounced CRASH) is completely bullcrap for the money that was spent..its not a training r/c plane!!!
4,Slave-Mines of Tornamil,I enjoyed this book. The slave owner actually cared for his slaves and didn't abuse them. However everyone else did. But in the end you can see real love. However it is very explicit and some cruel things are done to the women. But in this kind of book you expect that or you wouldn't be reading it.
4,Excellent product! BUT CAN'T BUY PARTS!!!,"Excellent product! It has met all my expectations, chopping leaves and chipping branches. Does best on larger wood if it's dry. Very easy to fix when it gets clogged or stops--just unscrew and take the top off. Very light and easy to drag around, too.The V blade broke, and I've just discovered that I can't get a new one!"
4,I am very pleased with the product,I am very happy with this product. The delivery was very fast. I have been making mulch for my gardens ever since the chipper shredder came.
3,Mc Culloch electric chipper shredder,Chipper does what it is advertised to do. It is fine for private occasional use on correct size materials. This is not for commercial work.
3,NO PARTS,"This is probably the best of the electric chippers available and for the price does an amazing job on normal yard debris. This unit has been sold under several different labels, and the problem I have with all of the them is the cheap / soft(?) steel used for the blades. They dull out rather quickly, and then you either stop to sharpen - or put up with a very slow processing speed. After 2 to 3 years there is nothing left to sharpen, and NO just because there is an illustrated parts list with part numbers does NOT mean you can order replacements. I guess at less than $250 for the unit they figure you'll just buy a new chipper! It's either that or $1000 (or more) for a gas powered chipper that is far more than most people need....."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Instructions for putting this together, while not clear, were managable. I got the whole thing together in 1 hour. Usage time? One (1) minute and it no longer works. I saw other reviews where people said this happened to them but I guess I'm an optimist. Having seen this up close it is clear it is badly designed. Feeding tubes are way to small for anything but the smallest pieces so of course it clogged up right away and now won't start at all. This item should not be for sale and Amazon should remove it from it's inventory. Clearly the manufacturer knows this item is no good because it is not available anywhere except from on-line sellers. Stores won't carry it because they know it's no good. I will now begin the process of trying to get my money back from the manfacturer. Please pray for me because I know from other reviews this will be very difficult. PS: tried to give it no stars but Amazon won't let me. It gets no stars."
2,"works ok, NO SPARES!","ok on leaves and DRY sticks. Doesn't work on fiberous woods. Jams easily and slow to clear. Slow to feed. The blades will wear and dull, but there are NO replacements available from McCulloch!!! Would you buy a mower you couldn't replace the blade on? Of course not. We got about 2 seasons worth of chopping before the ""V"" blade got too dull to be useful. I ground a new edge on it, but I dodn't think it will take another serious grinding. At that point we have to toss it."
4,MULCH AT MY SCHEDULE,"I hesitated buying this because of how complicated the assembly seemed and all the reviews that talked about it stopping up with debris, but at this price and with free shipping I'm glad I did. Assembly was a bit confusing but fairly straightforward, and took about 45 minutes by myself. When using I've had a few clogs but it's when I was trying to feed stuff too fast. I live in south florida and my city has gone from once a week yard trash pickup to twice a month. I was almost buried in the mounting pile, because I kept missing the right days to put the stuff out. Now I can turn that into mulch for the yard or composting at my schedule. I gave it 4 stars because the screws that hold the black chute are easy to strip and there should be a handle or something to make it easier to wheel around, other than that happy with purchase. My dogs love it too, they are always chewing on sticks,now they have bite sized chunks. I guess for them it's like a big salad shooter."
1,Dissatisfied,"Just bought this item to replace a Black & Decker Model 8501 shredder that I bought back in the 90's for $90. Loved that unit. This one I find is way too heavy, very difficult to move around. Cumbersome to use if you leave the top section on, works much better with it off but be sure to stand back a ways not right over the shoot as things can come flying back up. I stalled the unit with no problem just putting some tall grass ,20"" long, in it. It all wraped aroud the blades and popped the breaker. So far I am not very happy with the unit, sure wish B&D still made the 8501 it was a great unit and weighed about 15 pounds."
2,Not a timesaver,"I've had this machine for 2 years. It is not good with greens of any sort. I've left things out for 4 weeks trying to dry them out enough to shred without jamming. Doesn't matter. Green or dry, I have to disassemble the hopper every 10 minutes of operation and clean out the debris from the blades. Takes 5 minutes to disassemble. I've tried putting very small amounts through and waiting til all appears to have cleared the blades before feeding in more. That helps but extends the time by three fold. For a square yard of brush, expect to spend 2 hours feeding it through, unjamming the blades, feeding more through, unjamming the blades, feeding more through, unjamming the blades, etc. and add tripping a circuit breaker a time or two into the mix. I got this as a gift, but if I had spent money on this, I would not be getting my money's worth out of it. The power cord on mine split in two after an hours use recently for no apparent reason. Have no idea what caused that."
1,Very Dissatisfied with the Shredder,"I purchased this shredder from another vendor, not Amazon. It was the same exact shredder/chipper. I have returned the unit to the original company (I had to pay the shipping) and stopped payment on the purchase through my credit card company. The unit does not work. It keeps plugging up. It is poorly engineered. It took me three hours to shred two dried up grass plants because it kept plugging up and required me to take the unit apart and unplug it only to have it plug up in the next two minutes. When shipping the unit back, I noticed the blades were already not sharp. I was totally disappointed. My learning lesson, read more reviews further down on the list of people who rated it poorly."
3,Chipper-chump,"This machine looks and sounds powerful but if you don't ""baby"" it, any decent size stick, (larger than 1/2""), will bog it down and usually will trip the overload breaker. My wife can't get the hang of it and my older teen age son doesn't have the patience required to operate it. It's mainly good for light brush-pile clean up."
3,McCulloch 14-Amp Electric Chipper/Shredder #MCS2001,"The chipper does a fine job with branches less than an inch thick. When it jams, however, removing the upper part of the shredder is aggravating. A better design would incorporate a quick release. Aside from that, I am very pleased with its chipping and shredding ability."
4,Very good for general yard work,"I started out with a bag over the exit chute, and had to unjam the machine every 5-10 minutes -- big drag.However, if you are using dry material, lots of branches in the side chute, and NO BAG (let the mulch dump onto a garden), then this rarely jams!So I give this high marks once you figure that out!As others have said, the instructions for assembly are pathetic!"
4,Great Chipper/Shredder,"Assembly was relatively easy, especially after having read the reviews of others. Machine ran much quieter than expected. Purposely jammed the shredder with fiberous material, it took less than 5 minutes to dismantle and clear the blockage. Recommend this machine for light duty chipping of branches up to 1.5 inches in diameter."
4,Compost Galore,"I switched to a McCulloch after bad experiences with other types of shredder. String trimmer type - useless, gas hammer mill - cumbersome and hard to start. After several years really tough use (I went through three sets of cutting blades) my original McCulloch died and I'm replacing it with an identical unit. I like the easy starting of the electric drive and the availability of replacement blades. Why not 5 stars? Dry material shreds well but damp materials build up in the outlet bend and block the exit. Cleanout requires removal of the top section (three screws that challenge my arthritic thumbs) and meticulous cleaning around the cutters (low starting torque of motor means small pieces of debris can prevent acceleration)"
3,Good for small jobs,Assembly manual is nearly worthless but if you call the 800 number they can e-mail you a parts list with an exploded view that helps. As someone else mentioned the bolts break easily and are hard to find.Had I purchased it from a local retailer I would have taken it back and thats probably why I have only seen them online.Just finished my first job and reduced volume by about 15 to 1. It produces a very fine chip more suitable for composting than mulching.No problem with clogging but you have to do a lot of prep work before feeding the branches.It runs quiet and you shouldn't get any complaints from neighbors other than the swearing during assembly.
1,DOA,"Received it three weeks ago. Assembled it, dead as a door nail. Took it apart in case I did something wrong in assembly. Reassembled it. Still dead. Attempted to call McCulloch. Got a third party ""support"" line (eventually), who offered no support except the phone number of another third party vendor in my area (near Phoenix, AZ.) Brought the machine (pretty heavy b-----d) to the repair shop where it's sat with the safety (ironic name for it) switch on back order.My patience is running a bit thin. If the part (from China) comes in REAL soon and the g-dd--n thing works as advertised, I'll write another review. Otherwise, Amazon will be getting it back. (Wonder how that will work?)"
3,McCulloch electric chipper,McCulloch MCS2001 14-Amp Electric Chipper/ShredderIt was easy to assemble. Will chip small straight branches and worked well on my roses. Small brush and leaves would not go through the safety trap on top however. I had to cut a bigger hole in it to make it work. Don't tell the lawyers.
3,fine for very lightweight duty,"I've owned this shredder for about three years -- bought it to grind my weeds and clippings for compost. The material fed in has to be dry or the outlet chute clogs. This may be a safety feature, but is also a design flaw. The chute makes a right angle bend from the shredder body and the output jams up in it. I have found that the easiest way to grind almost anything is by feeding it into the ""branches"" port at the back, which seems to give it a better angle into the blades. I use a 1/4"" diameter wooden dowel to push the weeds and twigs into the port, and also to clean out the outlet chute. Cleaning the chute constantly keeps the shredder from jamming. Once it jams it has to be disassembled, which is a frustrating and time consuming process.The best thing about the shredder is that it is electric but the downside to that is the relative lack of power and capacity."
2,Hard Work!,I bought this as a present for my husband. It has virtually caused a divorce as he gets so angry with it. As long as you have plenty of time to feed in garden material very very slowly it works reasonably well. Useless for leaves as small stones cause sparks off the blade. Normally the machine cuts out but on occassions we have had smoking material discharged. As mentioned in most other reviews it cuts out frequently which is frustrating. Probably for the price though not much more can be expected.
5,A job well done!,"Carefully read all the reviews and decided that this machine would meet my needs. Assembly was a breeze (my mechanical aptitude is above average). Up and running in no time. WOW this machine is great for the SMALL jobs around our yard. With larger items, I took care not to be too aggressive with feeding (but yes, only very few times, trip the safety device and cut off). Maybe this is an improved model, but restarting was simple and quickly achieved in a matter of a few minutes (was not labor intensive or complicated). Four days straight and three large bags of chippings later, my project was done. The difference in the landscape is very noticeable. The machine is now in the hands of a co-worker who is also impressed. For the money, this machines exceeded my expectations."
1,Useless.,"I had great hopes for this machine--at least my wife did when she purchsed it. We are avid gardeners who wanted to add substantial composting to our arsenal. This McCullough machine is not designed to mulch 1)large twigs 2) rose canes 3) ornamental grass stalks, 4) any garden waste that is not bone dry. It can shred dry, very dry, leaves. Honestly, that's about it. Another devoted gardening friend also regrets purchasing this machine. In her words, ""it's good if for some inscrutable reason you want to chip chopsticks, one at a time."" I wish I had the money back in our pocket and I'd put it towards a real chipper shredder which, alas, will cost many hundreds of dollars. This machine is worthless. Did I mention it frequently jams? If jamming was a step in creating compost, this machine would be a champ. Bottom line: frustrating waste of time, space and money. DO NOT BUY if you need more than chopped dry leaves."
2,Works as advertised but one big drawback,"I purchased this chipper because I live in a suburban residential area and have a half acre with trees. I want to chip the tree branches and leaves that come down every year, but I wanted something compact that would not take up a lot of room in the garage, require the maintenance of a gas engine, and be really loud to disturb the neighbors. This unit arrived and was easy to assemble, and delivered as promised. The quality of chipping is good as advertised, it has no problem shredding leaves and larger branches. I ended up returning the unit however because the hopper is restricted to a small envelope sized opening and you need to spoon feed in leaves. It could take 15-20 minutes to shred the equivalent of one lawn bag of leaves. I just didn't have the patience for this tedious requirement. Will be looking for a larger open hopper chipper that you can just throw a bunch of leaves at a time through."
1,Instructions do count,"Hope to use the little chopper for backyard clean up. Putting the machine together was made so much easier by the nice person who rewrote the instructions which I printed out. Using the instructions which came with the shredder was like reading Chinese. Finally able to get to the backyard for some cleanup since garden cuttings and twigs had dried out. This machine jammed the very first time I tried to put a twig in the twig shoot. I called the number given for ""service"" and was told to take it to a local repairman. Well, $21.80 later I have been told that products of this nature coming from China are junk. It is little more than a glorified food processor. Of course, waiting for the right time to do the yardwork means that the product is no longer returnable. I hope Goodwill can find someone to recycle it."
2,Looks great but didn't work,"The product looked great on-line and, using the comments by other reviewers, I had no problem at all with assembly. Unfortunately, the thing did not work. After navigating the very frustrating resolution process with McCulloch and its designated warranty company (a separate entity), I finally took it to the local authorized repair tech. He found that the motor was missing key parts, which could only be obtained directly from the foreign manufacturer, not through McCulloch. After three months waiting for the promised part, I reluctantly contacted Amazon, and they gratiously agreed to refund the entire cost, including free return shipping. While disappointed with the product and McCulloch support, I'm once again pleased with Amazon's great customer service.Bottom line, while the product seems otherwise to be a good design (hence my 2-star rating), I guess it was just my bad luck to get a ""lemon."""
1,Not enought power,Not enough power.. my food processor would have done a better job.. Small branches caused it to clog up.
1,DOA,"Assembly per U12soccercoach's directions was a snap. Unfortunately the unit was dead on delivery. Checked the cord, safety interlock and switch to no avail. Called the warranty number and was told that it was a parts depot, no technicians were available for advice and my only option was to take it to a service center. Checked their web site for the nearest service center and found it to be poorly constructed and practically useless except for manuals. Left an email for Support. It has been almost two weeks and no reply. The chipper is on its way back to Amazon and I've bought my last product from Mccloch!"
3,review,"This chipper performs reasonably well once you learn what to do and what not to do. Thin branches with leaves should be inserted from the top. Thicker brnaches from the side. Do not turn off the device until you are confident all material you inserted has been expelled or you may not be able to start it again. Regadless, expect to need to release jams even with the best handling."
3,Shredded shredder,"I was disappointed with the chipper/shredder mainly due to the number of times it jammed while shredding brush. In order to clear the jam you have to loosen three thumb screws which takes over a minute to do. Then, after clearing the shedder, you reversed the process which also took over a minute. At times it seemed I was spending more time on the shredder than actually shredding brush. If the size of the brush had been large, I could understand the problem, but most of the brush was less than one inch in diameter."
4,Happy Chipper,This wood chipper went through a very large pile of brush in an afternoon only plugging a few times. The blade was pretty dull after I was done but I have a lot of mulch and no branches. I have rotated the blades around to their second edge. I wish there were carbide blades available for this chipper mulcher or some sharpening instructions.
1,Poor performance for home use,"Great price on the McCulloch chipper shredder, but even for home/residential use the performance is sub par. The small throat or opening requires lots of effort to feed leaves and other yard material into the unit. The unit continually clogs and then you have to turn unit off and then unscrew the top and remove the shredded material. I would not recommend purchasing this chipper shredder."
1,Underpowered. Jams more often than it runs.,"I've had one of these for almost two years now, and it continues to disappoint. It can handle only very small branches - not more than 3/4"" in diameter - and really can't continuous feed anything greater than 1/2"". It also is very prone to clogging - in particular if the material is at all green. If you are trimming a bush, better let the branches dry for a week before putting them through this. Upon clogging, you need to remove the top, clear the jam, and reassemble. Once you get good at it, it's about three minutes to do. You will need to do it roughly every two minutes of use, so you will get good at it quickly. This machine was a complete waste of money for me. I hate it more every time I use it."
3,"Good for small jobs, some assembly problems","I have 1/8 acre and this little guy turned out to be great for helping me clean up and bag brush and limbs. It handles brush and limbs as advertized. Overall I am happy with the unit for the size and price and the fact that I do not have to deal with the upkeep of a gas engine.The unit is suprisingly stout for the price, but I did find it difficult to assemble the legs, once I did get them in place, the heads of cheap screws that were included sheared off. I had to go out and find new screws to replace them which wasn't easy because they were metric flat heads. Once it was together it worked quite well. I did manage to dull the blades in about 5 hours of heavy use, so plan on sharpening the blades often if you are doing heavy work."
4,big bang for the money,"It's not perfect but after 1 year of use, worth the money.I use to shred leaves, wood, compost, humus, grass.... in fact anything I can use for my compost piles. If the wood pieces are to big ( more than 1/2 in diameter) it go in my fireplace. Time to time, the blades need to be sharp and if I go to fast need to be unclog; but this is nothing.very useful when you have a dozen of mature trees, 1 acre of grass and a garden.tip: I wait a few months ( 6 ) before to shred branches"
4,"okay, but not great","never used a mulcher before so don't have anything to compare against:the good:1) makes really good/fine mulch2) i'm using it more than i thought i would for sticks and small tree limbs3) feels sturdy and well built. expect to get several years of service out of it.the bad:1) ackward to move around in the yard. doesn't have a handle that you can pull with, pushing doesn't seem to work without even surfacee2) quite a few jams with green material, for example recently cut branches that have sat for a week (which were dry). Branches that still have some green, tend to slice open in shredder and wrap around cutting blade. Does great with dead wood.3) leaves chute is very slow and difficult to feed into,4) the knobs to open (to unclog cutting device) can be very difficult to tighten at times."
4,Pretty good leaf shredder,A little slow but it does the job - use it mainly to chop up leaves to use as mulch and for composting. For the price you can't expect more. I fed it string bean vines from the garden one yard at a time and it didn't clog up at first. But after awhile the green moist vines clumped together and finally jammed. Another time I fed it a couple of large bags of leaves mixed with some twigs and green grass and it went through just fine.You need to wear a dust mask. The paddle provided to push the stuff through is helpful. The instruction booklet was 85% helpful in putting it together and taking it apart when it got clogged. I am glad I bought it but wish I could feed it green stuff without clogging.
4,Good for suburban yard,"I concur with other reviewers that a few more picture details in the instructions would've sped up the assembly, but I did have it put together by myself in less than an hour.It is disappointing when a jam occurs and you have to open it up to clear the jam, but after awhile you get the hang of how to reduce the frequency of jams.Overall this performs to my expectations of keeping leaves, twigs and branches out of the landfill and using it in the yard.Cost effective solution to recycling garden trimmings in a suburban home with a medium size yard.This would definitely not be suitable for use on acreage where you're trying to recycle mass amounts of tree and shrub pruning."
2,For tiny jobs only,"A video review would be in order here, but sorry, I don't have a video.What I can tell you was that I was expecting to feed a hungry beast but with this product, you are force feeding a stubborn infant...It likes sticks. You can easily feed in individual rigid twigs surprisingly well (though 1 at a time).But you also need to feed your weeds in one at a time from the top through a tiny opening, jamming it all of the way down to the blade with the supplied spade.Out comes shredded stuff that needs to be fed through again.Thoroughly unimpressive.I'm keeping it because I soon expect to have tons of leaves to do, and I'm hoping it can handle them bearably well, though I'm not holding my breath.This is for little old ladies with a tiny yard that want to produce a pound of compost for their potted plants. Beyond that it is just a toy."
2,Fuggetaboutit,"We needed to dispose of a large amount of small brush, so ordered this unit with anticipation of creating mulch and not lugging cans down the hill for the ""greens"" pickup. My husband is an engineer and most capable around nasty yard jobs; however .... having to wrestle a 70 lb. unit with no handle is not pleasant. Neither is having to stop every few minutes to unclog the intake. After an hour he appeared, both dusty, sweaty and aggravated. Nevermore.... Amazon, however, saved the day by accepting its return. The only good thing about it was the low price."
4,Palm tree cuttings are OK,"Palm tree leaves and stems are all fiber. This machine does a good job with dry palm cuttings, and that is a tough job. Much tougher than trees. I would go for 5 stars except for the caging knob (threaded fastener) to hold the hopper to the grinder. I had to substitute a pin connector to allow me to open and clean the hopper in a reasonable amount of time when it jams. It does jam with wet, green material or if I feed too fast. It is a solid purchase."
1,All hype little performance,This machine will only allow such a small amount of material to be put into it because of hopper design. A handful of leaves is all it will hold and then they must be pushed thru a narrow slot. Removing hopper helped some but constant clogging means you will spend as much time cleaning it out as you do shredding.It will not handle any volume of wet or damp material. Save your money as this is the WORST TOOL IN THE WORLD!
1,What is taking so long?,I will evaluate this item should it ever arrive.When I purchased it on Aug 4 the estimated delivery date was Aug 10. After it failed to arrive I went back to my account to discover the estimated date of delivery was now Aug 17. Today is Aug 14 so I still have to wait until next week for it to arrive and then for the weekend to try it out. Had I known I would have paid the additional cost to receive it in a timely mannerAmazon has never done this to me in any of my other purchases so why this item is taking forever to get here is beyond me. An explanation via e-mail would have been helpful
3,Not a great shedder,"The product does a decent job of mulching small twigs, but it takes some time as you have to feed each one. As for shredding leaves, it's not really worthwhile b/c you have to push each handful into the hopper with the tool and this is very time-consuming. I get better results with a handheld electric leaf blower/shredder."
1,Terrible product,Did not even last five minutes before the motor completely burned out. The product is so heavy weight wise it would cost a fortune to ship it back for a new one. Don't waste your money buying one.
1,Piece o' junk,"After 2 months of intermittent service in my yard, it needs a new capacitor and circuit breaker."
1,I have not used it yet,I bought this item in November and received it on the 23rd. I found out that Mcculloch is no longer in business and parts are no longer available for it. I would advise no one to buy this product. If anything goes wrong with mine then I will have to stand the loss.
3,Solid but limited performance,"This chipper/shredder is solidly built but slow in performance of either of its functions. The shredder's capacity is limited to only a handful or two at a time and needs manual assistance in feeding the leaves through the narrow opening which separates the hopper from the shredding mechanism. The chipper's stated ability to handle branches up to 1 inch diameter is exaggerated for the oak branches I've been feeding it.Assembly was a chore to perform alone due to the weight of the motor, and attaching the legs to the housing isn't intuitive as the width's differ.While the end product is satisfactory, it takes such a long time to complete either task that I really wonder if it is worth the effort involved even for my small home property."
2,Replacement parts not available,"I was reasonably satisfied with my McCulloch Chipper/Shredder, except that I must use great care to keep from overloading the chipper. If it shuts down, I must take it apart to clear the jam. With experience, this isn't so bad. Also, screws holding the top plastic housing shake loose and disappear.I've owned it for 4 years, with intermittent use, rarely heavy use, and this is what I find:Once parts break, you can't get replacements.Now that the V-cutter has broken, it appears that my only option is to scrap this chipper. Unacceptable! I don't believe that I've received my money's worth of use.I think that in future, choosing a company that offers longer term parts availability would be a better choice - maybe Sears?"
2,Waiting for a return call from supplier,"I assembled the product and was ready to shred some material but the shredder would not start. I reviewed the manual, assured the interlock switch was depressed, assured there was power to the unit and it would not start. I checked for resistance in the motor circuit with the interlock switch depressed and the meter showed an open circuit. I called the supplier with information supplied by Amazon and after 3 days have yet to receive a return call to discuss the issue. Will call again later today."
3,Seems OK,"It was quite easy to put together...It doesn't have much power though....Maybe that's a saftey thing... Right away, it tripped the reset... So I just go slower...It's fine.."
4,Hard to find one better,"I have looked for an electric chipper/shredder for a long time. Very happy with the job this McCulloch performs. No jams, no problems. Do have to keep the feed loads under control and don't rush the shredding process. That is true for all residental grade products.Good buy, good price, good product."
4,McCulloch MCS2001 14 Amp chipper/shredder,"At best this is a light duty chipper, however, if not pushed to harshly it will do the job. The 14 amp rating, is close to the 15 Amp electrical box circuit rating. If the machine is stalled even for a few moments it will pop the internal (Unit) breaker.I had a stick break off inside the unit and jam it. The only way inside the unit is to remove the screw pattern of the top cover, (with pliers since the screws are one-way screws) and clear the unit from the top. (Be sure to unplug the unit).My application is and was for hedge bushes and berry bush debris. If you need to mulch larger items, buy a larger more powerful unit."
3,It gets the job done.,"This chipper/shredder is a fine homeowner use product. It chips small branches (1-1/4"" maximum) very uniformly. I believe the manufacturer indicated it could chip up to 1-/1/2"" branches, we found that anything over 1-1/4"" would either jam the machine or bog the motor down. Also, we found that wet brush would tend to clog in the exit chute. Overall fairly happy with the purchase. It does what we intend it to do. It's constructed with safety in mind, although, that causes it take a bit longer to clean jams as a result."
3,"It works well for small sticks, but assembly was not the best","The screw holes in the legs do not line up all that well, so getting aligned properly where all 4 feet sit on the ground at the same time was a challenge. The holes are drilled straight instead of an angle.I have several large birch trees that are always dropping small branches. This unit has worked fine on them."
4,Great Machine,"This machine is great for my needs and yard.Are there features I'd like to have? Sure, butthe size of my yard does not warrant the additinal costfor them. I would reccomend it to anyone with a small tomedium yard."
4,Aviod problems with assembly,"Read the assembly instructions and the review by u12soccercoach but modify his comments as follows:You don't need two people if you follow the instructions about removing the yellow top and PLACING A 2X4 UNDER THE MOTOR by the power cord. Actually, I used two 2x4's and that really helped.Axle assembly: No need to move the bolts to the outside but be sure to leave the bolts attaching the legs to the axle VERY loose to allow easy movement.Attaching the leg assembly to the motor housing:Hint: Place the small end of the hex wrench thru the leg and the solid aluminum barrel to keep them aligned while inserting the first bolt. If you experence any problem with binding - loosen the bolts attaching the axle to the legs.I love the small chips the chipper produces but assume shredding leaves will be a very slow process; but, hey this is a $200 unit not an $800 one.Easy to move about and so quiet."
2,not what we wanted,Amazon: This chipper was not what we expected. We had to feed leaves by hand and was disappointed in the way it mulched the leaves as we were trying to bag them with no luck from the mulcher into the bag. We received a confirmation of our refund 2/9/07. Our Amazon-Chase card has not been credited for the amount as of 3/1/07. The chipper has been returned. Will be waiting to be credited for the amount of 215.96. Thank you
3,"Tough to use, but workable","This is a good product, however the ""safety"" devices at the top and bottom make it almost impossible to use without clogging every three minutes.I had an identical machine fifteen years ago without the rubberized flaps to impede the material being inserted and expelled, it worked much better without the hassle of taking it apart to clear so often!As does this one after I removed them! Which is difficult to to 'one way' screws to deter removal!"
4,Good Low End Chipper,"This is a good inexpensive chipper. It gets the job done, but it is slow. It is amazing how many branches you can shred and how small of amount of wood chips you get. Also, it is very finicky about having anything in the cutting blade when you turn it off. When you are finished with a branch, you need to let it run for 30 seconds or so after you think the branch is completely finished. If there are any residual wood chips in the blade, the unit will not start again after you shut it off. You then have to take it apart and clean out the blade. It becomes a pain. My advise it to minimize the number of times you need to start and stop the machine and let the machine run for 30 seconds or more after you think every thing has cleared from the blade. The unit seems pretty safe."
4,I LIKE IT,"iVE NOW HAD THE THING FOR A FEW MONTHS,, HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO TRY IT OUT. firST, LET ME SAY THAT i HAD NO PROBLEMS PUTTING THE UNIT TOGETHER, , i WAS SUPRISED AT THE WEIGHT , 75 LBs. I did have a learning curve, not to work it more that it wants, It is not a heavy duty machine, I have now put about 4 pick up loads thu it, Its still humming and cutting, Its a great tool for normal yard waste and tree and bush trimmings. And the free shipping was a PLUS_PLUS, thanks for that."
3,Mechanical genius required for assembly,"The included directions are pretty poor. The pictures aren't particularly helpful. I don't happen to have the recommended 2 X 4 support piece around. The ""customer service"" number isn't for assistance in assembly. I'll somehow get it done, but i feel driven to drink! It's going to be a lot longer than the hour and a half spent by others...... Well, I've finished, finally! I've been at it about 2 1/2 hours. Part of the problem was i had the motor assembly upside down. (Okay, i'm not very good at assembling, but i fumble through.) It would have been very helpful to have had a photo!!! I'll test out the thing tomorrow. I'm half dead now. :)) But at least it's done. It would be nice to have some kind of steering handle, as it's a bit awkward to maneuver around the yard."
3,Not so good for leaves,"Fortunately, I followed the assembly instructions provided in another review of this product. Still, I find it is not so good for leaves but much better for small branches. The leaves don't clear the hopper when you turn the unit off. Then when you turn it on again, it acts as though it is jammed and you have to go through the reset process. Plus the chute opening is much too small to accept more than a handful of leaves at a time. If this weren't so difficult to take apart, i would seriously consider returning it."
4,McCullough Cipper/shredder,"Excellent chipper,makes short works of fallen branches. However, the leaf shredder feature is a little slow. Leaves need to be be quite dry in order to move smoothly through the shredder, if they are damp it clogs up. All in all, it works pretty well. The compact size makes it easy to store."
2,"Destroyed 1, no parts available, 2 replacements defective","I boung my first McCulloch MCS2001 electric chipper/shredder in 2009. It performed perfectly as advertized and I was very happy with it. Spring of 2011 I put it to work only to have the inside assembly unscrew (center hold down bolt, square washer and bushing) and chew up the blades and inner workings to the point that the unit was unworkable. [Note: I view this as a maintenance issue, not a problem with the shredder]. However, I was unable to locate the replacement parts needed to repair it. I ordered a second machine. Once assembled and plugged in, it did not work. No turn-over of the motor whatsoever. I returned it to the dealer and received a replacement. Much to my amazement, IT did not work. The motor in this case would start but the (unobstructed) blades did not turn and the overload protection switch tripped after about 5 seconds. I returned it for a refund of the purchase price. My rating: (5+0+0)/ 3 = 1.7, rounded up to 2."
5,The right product for me.,"I love the chipper. It is very effective for what I need.I have had problems with the grinder being jammed when I start it, but, that's what you get with an AC-powered product. It needs to get up to speed. There is no power from a dead start and small pieces of wood can wedge between the blade and the chassis. I found that letting the chipper run for about two minutes after I stop feeding it solves the problem. If you listen you can hear if there are still pieces flinging around inside the device. Let it run until all you hear is the smooth hum of the motor.Opening the chipper is easy -- 3 wingnuts. So, when it does jam it takes less than a minute to open, clear, and reassemble.This is a good product."
1,Great until reset button died,"After chipping/shredding about 5 gal of shredded waste, the reset button died and the machine no longer works.When it worked, it was easy and fun...but inoperable, it is a waste of money."
5,Great chipper shredder!,"Excellent little chipper/shredder! Just one word of advice, feed branches of 1"" diameter or greater as slowly as possible otherwise, you'll be removing the top and clearing the blades to get it going again. Also, during assembly, the stand is about 3 inches wider than the casing it's supposed to hold, so the final assembly appears slightly crow-footed (cambered). In any case it is a sturdy unit and excellent for small jobs."
3,breaks pretty fast,"I bought this unit in 2008, the V-blade broke after two months, but costumer service send me a new one. Second V-blade broke after ten months, pretty much ripping the ""drum"" apart. Brought it to the service center, cant be repaired, spent a couple hours on the phone playing phone-warranty-pong, but finally got my refund.Just ordered the second one because there is just nothing comparable, so here am I again, if it breaks again I know how to get my money back :)"
3,"Good unit, poor instructions","Great unit for the price. Was extremely surprised at how quiet the operation was. Easy to use and fairly easy to move around. Instruction manual really needs some help. Unless very handy with equipment assembly and improvising, assembly will be a problem."
1,mcculloch 14 amp chipper/shredder,"McCulloch MCS2001 14 amp Electric Chipper/ShredderTHe worse tool I ever brought. Never worked right from day one. Any little twig would shut it down. Always removing top to clean it,because the chips it made would also shut it down."
1,do not buy from True Value,I also did not receive it. Eventually received order cancellation after sending complaints.
5,More than I hoped for,"As I don't own acres of property, I couldn't justify the expense and maintenance costs of a gas powered chipper/shredder and thought I'd give this a whirl based on the many positive reviews I saw when searching.I have not been disappointed.Not only did the unit ship quickly, it has the power needed to deal with most yard waste and is easy to disassemble for unclogging and cleaning. As I live in Florida, there is a lot of ""stringy"" waste that can get caught up around the rotor but overall this thing has exceeded my expectations.Anyone interested in reducing the volume of yard waste and/or wants to compost their yard waste, this is a great unit for the price."
4,good - small - electric,"I like electric tools since you don't have to worry with gas, oil and maintaining it. You do give up some power for this. We have a small yard and this is perfect for DRY materials. Green things seem to clog it. I also make sure and run the chipper until ALL the materials are out, otherwise you get a jam. It works well on leaves and corn stalks. I am glad we bought it. It is easy to use."
1,junk!!!! warning!!!!!,"It was almost too good to be true. Purchased from retailer(major retailer) who couldnt supply parts for it. Subsequently, retailer ceased selling it. PARTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET. Simply, the cutting blades eventually get dull and wear out. They are unavailable in the U.S. AND HAVE BEEN FOR AT LEAST TWO OR MORE YEARS. McCulloch now owned maybe by Huskvarna but who knows for certain. Parts available only through Parts Tree. Obtained from overseas. The machine is an incredible machine for the price and for what it does, And is ELECTRIC which makes it quiet, and not generating of local pollution but the fact that there is/ has been NO SUPPORT for the machine which makes it a piece of crap. You cant give it away because the idiot who takes it is also stuck with out being able to get parts for it. SO SAD!!!!!"
2,Sue,"The booklet says that leaves will be pulled into the shredder by the vacuum - we found that this didn't happen, and the process is really slow. Don't buy this shredder to shred bags of leaves - it'll take forever! I bought it to make mulch from small branches, as I use a lot of mulch and we have a wood nearby. It did chip branches, but again it was slow, and the mulch is very fine, rather like coarse sawdust. I was disappointed, and felt I should have spent more and gone for a more powerful unit."
4,Good Little Mulcher,"Overall the McCulloch Chipper/Shredder is a good little mulcher. It isn't the fastest or the most powerful, but as an electric mulcher it performed much better than expected. The motor has good torque so the unit can chew through branches up to 1.5"" - however they should be dried as green branches will shred and clog the blades. Assembly was not easy but not as bad as described in other reviews. So far the unit has been quite durable too."
4,McCulloch Electric Chipper/Shredder Model:MCS2001,"As a woman of 83, I waited for help in putting my McCulloch Electric Chipper/Shredder Model: MCS2001 together. Everything went well except that McCulloch 14 Amp Chipper/Shredder # MCS2001there was no mention of the tube inserts so they were left out of the installation. Later we noticed a drawing showing them but as there was no reference to them at all in the directions, they are now ""extra parts."" I did a sample chipping and it worked but it has not had any extensive use yet. I do think the instructions should be revised to include all parts."
4,First time user of a shredder,"Jams are inconvenient to clear because it requires the upper housing to be unbolted, removed and reinstalled. Transport is awkward without a handle. I wish that it did more damage to plants with thorns. Overall, it works well."
4,Electric Chipper/Shredder,"I'm happy that we got this product to get rid of all discharged materials in the garden, we'd produced a lot of mulch and the yard looks better than ever, since we don't have a shed there is the inconvenience of bringing it up from the basemenet into the backyard, the shredder is a little bit heavy to do this.....I will say that is the only disadvantage.Sincerely,Patricia Miceli"
2,Works if conditions right maybe,"I bought this to chop up the various debris from taking care of my yard.Ran into problems as soon as I opened the box. Instructions not clear. Had to funble through getting it together and some parts just did NOT want to connect.Tried various leaves & trimmings. Looked pretty sitting in the backyard but I could have done more constructive work chopping things up by hand.Gave up and tried to sell it. So far, no takers."
4,Gots ta be,Gots ta be was 6the follow up to there best song Uh Huh they went for a slower feel here but it was not the First time around there was no magic anymore from them ever.Lyrics 8/10 Production 7/10 Overall 7.5/10
4,Religious music from the 19th century,"If one likes the songs of the Shakers written in the late 18th and early 19 century that were without musical instruments, then you may like this CD. I found 8 songs out of the 30 or more on the CD that I liked, the others I did not care for much. This is no fault of the creators of the Cd, it is simply the style of the Shakers of the past."
5,Insightful,Ever wanted to consider voting or political affiliation trends of the african-american community?This author breaks it down and provides data to back it up!
2,Not feeling it,I read this book for a class assignment and I must say that I find her argument unconvincing and chaotic. The structure of the book and her argument is mercurial and the amount of errors in the book are alarming...Read if interested in the subject matter although I think there are probably better books on the subject that reach similar conclusions she does.
5,Mag-lite Holster,I have a LED AA maglite which is longer than the regular lite and this holster fits perfectly along with my leatherman supertool.
3,Great workman ship,"Design needs improvement. The flashlight wants to turn itself on in the holster. Also, when sitting it tends to push the flashlight ""up"" --- A flap over the top of the flashlight as well would likely and perhaps a bottom to the flashlight side.The leatherman tool I have is fairly large. This would likely fit the 'wave' perfectly, but the slightly larger one needed me to stretch the leather a little. This is not a design flaw, and does not affect my rating since you can't make everything fit. If this were larger, the wave owners would complain its too large. Such is life.Overall a nice piece, with the flashlight exceptions above."
1,after a month found the holster very cheaply put to gather,at 1st thought it was great now i am on my 2nd one the back where its sewed is only in 1 spot and after a month it just falls apart being from mag i thought it was great but now i think its a waste of money unless you take it some where and have it reinforced i would not buy again good luck
4,"Holy Cow, This is Big","I just received this item today and while it looks decently made, it's much bigger than I thought it would be and I'll be returning it. This could easily fit a Leatherman Surge, the largest multi-tool they make. I don't want something as gigantic as this on my belt (but maybe if you work construction or something, this wouldn't be a problem). I'm giving it four stars because there's nothing wrong with the product, and I would be keeping it if it were smaller."
4,leathermen case,"The case looked good qualty a little bulky though but did the job i need to do didn't like i had to pay for shiping But it got here fast ,all and all happy with product."
4,Tight Fit,The mag light part is a tight fit and sometimes hard to pull out. The leatherman holster is a great fit for mid to small leathermans only. Overall its a good item.
3,"Very clear, good understanding of Russian style""",Entremont has a great understanding of Rachmaninoff. A very enertaining cd of exelant passages and buetiful slow interludes. -Matthew Weissman
1,Terrible,"I plugged it into my phone nothing happened, some piece looked like it was already broken when i recieved it...not because of shipping problems but because it is just a poorly produced product. Save your money on this you can get an adapter for any headphones for a few dollars more."
2,Flimsy but at least its cheap.,Earphones are held together with a rubber/plastic ring which will come off easily if improperly seated in the ear. At least it came with extra foam pads for the buds.
3,It does the job,"Well, it's not so comfortable as other models but it does the job to hear music with average quality and also attend calls at the sametime. Both functions are well supported by this earphones but if you are looking for an extreme sound, with noise reduction, stereo surround and looks like a ""technological weirdo"" this is not the item you want."
3,Motorola wired headset,"All in all, I would say this is a fair value for the wired headset. The sound from the phone is not crystal clear, but I'm not sure if that's a product of the phone (Motorola KRZR) or headset. Also, the earbuds don't really fit securely in the ear leading to them falling out over extended periods or rapid head movements."
2,Not so great,I wanted to get a stereo hands free so I could use my razr v3t's mp3 capability and still answer calls. The only good things about this product are that it is compatible with the phone and is one piece. The sound from the earbuds is hollow and annoying. I ended up buying a stereo headset adapter (with microphone) and better headphones. I don't recommend this product if you want to hear both your music and your calls.
1,Did Not Work,"I bought this headset because my roomate had just purchased it in town and so I thought I could find it on the internet for a cheaper price. Which I did. I read the reviews and about half of them said that it didn't work. Well I thought I might be one of the lucky ones and get a product that functioned properly. I did not. It doesn't work.The reason I gave this a star at all is because when I wrote to the company that I purchased it from, they replied promptly and refunded the money back to me."
2,Decent as headphones,"I bought this product for my RAZR V3x. It works ok for headphones to hear my music. I'm not real picky about the quality of the sound. These headphones do not produce a exceptionally crisp, clean sound. You can hear your music, and that's pretty much what I expected for the price. I also could not get them to work as a headset with my phone for sending or answering calls. The people I talked to couldn't hear me; said it sounded like there was too much static or interference. So it's an instance of you get what you pay for."
4,Motorola Head phones,"According to my daughter, they are working fine. Are as good as the original ones. She is satisfy with the product."
3,not so bad,"This item feels kinda cheap, but it is cheap, so what do you expect? The sound quality isn't very good, but i only got it for hands free phone calls, so it does the job fine for me. If you are wanting to listen to music with high quality headphones, i suggest buying the adapter and using nicer more expensive headphones."
1,Doesn't work with my phone and sound quality is horrible!,"Does not work with the Motorola W490. The phone does recognize the headset after several minutes, then stops working a couple of minutes later. When it does work, sound quality when listening to mp3s is horrible! Also, pushing the talk button on the headset will freeze the phone. Even if your phone supports it, don't buy!"
1,Disappointed,Sound quality was poor and they seemed to be an older version than the ones that came with my phone. Broke in less than two weeks.
1,Junk,"I understand that this is not an expensive product and that one gets what one pays for; but nonetheless i am dissapointed.The earbuds are awkward, uncomfortable and provide little in the way of sound quality. The mic is poorly placed and is prone to pulling the right bud out of one's ear. The mic itself is less than relyable (mine never worked). Within two weeks the headphones completely stopped working and were no longer recognized by the phone when plugged into the USB port. With the cost to return the item greater than the product's value i had no choice but to trash the headset and chalk it up as a loss."
1,CCMACCESSORIES,"This product was shipped to me promptly but it was broken. I contacted the seller twice to resolve it. The seller is CCMACCESSORIES. They asked me to remove my negative feed back and assured me they would send a replacement. When they didn't, I contacted them again. They assured me they would resolve this issue. I reported it to AMAZON today. The defective order came from CCMACCESSORIES. Maybe you should stop and think before you order from CCMACCESSORIES."
1,horrible,"they had static the first time i used them. then they cleared up then started again. Then after i used them all of three times...the ear part began to come off. then it came off completley by the end of the first week and the wires were hanging out...cheap price, HORRIBLE ear phones!"
1,Awful,"I purchased this headset for my RAZR V3m. The sound quality was okay. However, after using them about 3 times, they stopped working all together. The phone didn't even recognize that they were plugged in. They are also very cheaply made and don't seem like an OEM product at all."
1,Too expensive for poor quality,"I bought them from A1, I had to wait more than a month, and finally got it because I complained to Amazon. Not the original stuff guys... I've got a beautiful L7 Motorolla which could compete with the iPod in sound quality up until I lost the originals. Intended to get the same product... forget it... The sound is lousy. Do not buy it !!!"
1,Piece of Junk,"It had fallen apart during shipment. My son attempted to fix it, and it only fell apart even more. It ended up in the trash."
2,"Plastic, Not metal like the single you recieve with your phone","Plastic, Not metal like the single you recieve with your phone"
1,Disappointed,It didnt work.I cant rate this item because it didnt work unless you have a value of 0(zero).
1,Worse than Motorolar's Cell Phone,"I have a Motorola RAZR V3 cell phone. It is nothing but cute appearance. Very inconvient menu design. Lose contact items once in a while (don't know where did they go). My friends who have Motorola cell phones had all kinds of problems, but I bought RAZR because of it appearance. However, I am still surprised that Motorola's headset design even sucks more. Very loud background noise. Everyone I talked to complained about the noise they hear. It is almost a useless junk. Will never buy Motorola's products in my life time. I would rate it as 0 star if there was such an option."
4,Great scent for a great price.,I bought this for my son and he loves the scent. You can't beat the price for this designer fragrance.
1,dont bother,"I like the idea of this movie. The leading actor who is also the director, editor and writer leave much to be desired, like talent for example. This movie is the definition of ignorable, fall flat horror films."
4,Not bad,"This was a semi-good movie. There were a few moments of humor written into the script and mild violence that made the movie pretty good. It wasn't overly violent and the plot was decent. Overall, I didn't think it was a bad movie."
3,Fine for the money...,"Decent non professional home movie quality...all one can expect for the price which is low. Havent tried the still component yet. Good zoom capacity, not so good low light capacity."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMCORDER!,"This camcorder is unreliable. I purchased one locally (not from Amazon.com), and it failed after I had recorded less than one and a half tapes. Unfortunately, by that time it was out of warranty, so I am stuck with it although it is now useless. Checking online, I discovered that other owners have experienced the same problem. (The camcorder will not record or play tapes because the ""eject"" signal appears even with new tapes.) After this experience, I would avoid all Samsung products."
1,My Last Samsung Product,"This camera worked fine for a while. After about six months, I started getting a mechanical fault. This camera has less than 2 hours of total use, has been stored and used carefully in the box it came in. Samsungs min charge for repairs is $80.00. $40.00/hr seems just a bit steep for a camcorder and I just can't see spending 40% of the retail cost for repairs in what has proven to be an inferior quality product. Save your money, buy a Canon."
4,Icredibe price and size,very compact and great mini dv at an incredible price.My old sony died and got this at a fraction of the price that I paid for the sony
1,don't buy this,"This camera does not come with the ability to download onto a computer with XP or later versions, it sucks!! Spend your money elsewhere!"
2,Some nice features but needs light,This needs A LOT of light. I returned this do due the lighting/picture quality. The one nice thing about it is you can record decent video quality on a memory card-mpeg 4.
3,Good for Starters,This camcorder is easy to use so it was great for us starters. But the lighting isnt great inside.
3,samsung sc-d363,"I wouldn't buy it again, but, it does work with firewire with windows 7. I just made a video of a talent show and the sound is really good. The picture quality is not the best, but not bad either for the price. It does have a lot of features. All in all it is not a bad camera."
1,Camcorder is not working,"I bought this Camcorder in Amazon.com and brought to Brazil (where I live) and I could not use the Camera yet, because it's not working. I had to send to a Sansung store and they told me that they can't fix. Thus I lost my money with a product that I'll never use."
1,Not Very Loud,Product was bought for a very sound sleeper. Alarm is not very loud. It came without any instructions. Do not buy this cheaply made clock.
1,NOT HAPPY,"THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS ALARM CLOCK IS THAT IT IS RED IF YOU ARE A AVERAGE SLEEPER IT WILL WORK, OR IF YOU HAVE A BEDROOM THAT LOOKS LIKE A FIRE STATION IT MIGHT FIT BUT FOR SOMEONE THAT IS A HARD SLEEPER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE"
2,FIRE BELL ALARM CLOCK NOT LOUD AS EXPECTED,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY SON WHO IS 17 AND IMPOSSIBLE TO WAKE UP. IT WAS ADVERTISED AS BEING LOUD LIKE A ALARM BELL, BUT TO MY CHAGRIN, AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN SINCE IT IS POWERED BY ONLY 2 AA BATTERIES, THAT IT IS MORE OF A BUZZING BELL NOT A CLANGING ONE DEPICTED. IF IT WAS ELECTRIC WITH A CLANGER, THEN IT MAY HAVE BEEN LOUD ENOUGH, THIS IS MORE FOR A GAG GIFT THAN TRULY AN EXTRA LOUD ALARM CLOCK."
4,It wakes him up!,"Bought this for a friend's son who couldn't wake up to normal alarm clocks. This worked for him. It's nice and loud, though not a 'pretty' sound, of course. Then my friend borrowed it because her clock broke. She forgot to set it and they both overslept. (sigh)"
1,Cheap Piece of Crap--crappy customer service,"Looked perfectly fine when opened box. Inserted new batteries as per instructions. Nothing happened--no digital clock, no sound, & no lights. Tried second set, same thing--nothing. Called the number for the manufacturer, got a quick call back from them but there is absolutely nothing they can do. Told to contact seller & seller fails to take any responsibility for sending a piece of crap. Manufacturer told us that clock had to have been damaged in shipping from seller or seller mailed out a knowingly defective/previously returned clock as they are all working when they ship out to seller. Seller refuses any responsibility and says we have to deal with Amazon. Amazon claims its not a problem on their end so will only do a refund minus cost of shipping to return it. Total got screwed on this one!!!Avoid this item and all of their sellers!"
1,Frustrating and disappointing to watch!,"BIG BROTHER 4 - it is obviously incomplete, chopped up pieces of the season's programs, difficult to follow because of the missing parts - it should have been the entire series that was on the DVD or don't make a DVD at all!"
2,Please release more!!!,"I have not got this as BB3 box set was SO excellent. Being in Australia, our Big Brother series is complete rubbish. The USA Big Brother is fantastic and I can say everyone I've shown season 3 to have become addicted.Why not release more like this. They would certainly sell. If the market is there, why not use it???"
1,Worst Big Brother Season Ever!,"I hated this season so much! I liked the other seasons, but this season was a utter disapointment. Bad casting, ending, and everything! The X-Factor twist sucked big time!Thank God BB5 came out and it's much better than this crap. What an improvement BB5 was!"
1,Why,"After putting out a nice but not spectacular set for season 3, why would they put out a total piece of garbage like this? Poor video, not every episode, bare bones edition. If you don't care about the bells and whistles, at least put out all the episodes of the season in the package. The description on Amazon is very sketchy, and only by reading the reviews do you know that it is not a complete set."
2,THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE SEASON!!!!!!!!,"This DVD set is not the complete sesaon, just a highlight reel! What a disappointment! Also it is clearly marked as a ""best of"" DVd on the actually packaging and that information is missing from the scan of the cover shown on Amazon!!! I was so disappointed! I gave the DVD 2 stars because of my general love of BB, but left off the other 3 stars that it surely would have gotten from me had it been the DVD set I thought I was getting!"
1,Misleading DVD,"NOT the entire series...was trying to figure out why it was edited in such a bizarre way. It was like watching the series in fast forward. I LOVE BB and I always wait for the DVD version, but this was a BIG disappointment."
3,Good for what it is,"The other reviews are criticizing it for not being the complete set, but I think it's good for what it is, which is a ""best-of"" season 4. It's two discs, features extra footage plus newly recorded interviews with the HGs. David and Amanda do the nasty, Nathan saves Allison then gets betrayed, Robert calls the girls names, salad bikinis...all the highlights are on this DVD. It would be great if more Big Brother DVDs were released."
1,Big Brother WRONGED by CBS,I couldn't agree with ALL of you more. I wish I read these reviews beforehand. I just received it in the mail- all ready to watch the ENTIRE season- and realized what it was. I immediately went on-line to see if I made a mistake and ordered an edited version. I am devastated to hear that this is what CBS released. It's sad considering you can buy entire collections for almost every popular show ever put out and then some!
5,Magnificanet Collection of Australian Aboriginal Art,"The book has two parts. The first explains the symbolism in Australian Aboriginal painting, while the second shows a collection of paintings. It's a magnificient book! I recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of art. My only regret about this book is that I didn't buy it when I spotted it in a bookstore in Paris."
3,Seems okay to me.,"I too bought this TV from Target on Black Friday and have not had a problem. For $180 you aren't going to get a Sony or Samsung-like picture. I have noticed that the picture is slightly better than my old TV when I watch satellite but when I play DVDs the picture is really pretty good. I wanted the TV mainly to save space in my bedroom and I didn't want to drop $400-500 on a similar size from one of the better electronics companies. On the whole, I'm pretty satisfied."
3,Not Bad,"I recieved this TV as a gift. I already own a Samsung large screen but I figured I could put this one in a kitchen or a smaller room. It definitely has a 'Unique' shape to it. As far as picture quality it dosent compare to the Samsung. I owned another 20 inch LCD that broke and that one had a better picture on it than this. The sound quality isnt bad. The more I looked at it the more I liked the shape of the TV. The TV is very light weight and the plastic material used isnt what Id call 'great quality'. Its sufficient, it works fine and its not bad looking but im sure you could find something better out there... but for the price its a decent deal and does the job."
1,Monitor blacked out,"I bought this less than a year, and the monitor is now pitch black. There is sound but no picture! Since it is past the 90 days, there is nothing target can do. I knew the LCD monitor will no last, but didn;t think it would be less than a year! Waste of money!!!!!!! Never buy Target brand again!"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Bought this from Target for $349. just AFTER the 90 days, it got pixel burn, red and blue dots over the screen. we followed all care to avoid this so dont know why it happened. also the remote only works if you hold it in a specific position and it is dark in the room, a real pain. Target will not accept since it is after the 90 days so i have had the ""pleasure"" of calling TruTech and being told it will prob cost $80 to return and repair. this TV is not worth even that, we are really disappointed."
1,JUNK!,"We bought this item over the summer (more than 90 days ago). Yesterday, for no reason, the TV died -- partial blue screen, partial white screen, non-responsive to any remote control signals or manual commands. Unfortunately for me, we did not buy the extended warranty. The only value I've retained from this item is a lesson learned."
1,Doesn't. work,The cheap brands at Wal-Mart work better. I couldn't even tell a diffrence. I don't see this product helping anyone quit smoking.
3,"OK, not great","The fun of this fluffy movie was watching John Wayne out of his usual role. He was very good. Jean Arthur is always a delight. The last line was almost worth the whole movie and was the best line. Recommended only for fans of Wayne, Arthur or oldies."
4,Lady & Wayne,Good film but not Wayne's best. Quality of print is somewhat lacking. Always enjoy Jean Arthur.
4,A Lady Takes A Chance,"I am a BIG John Wayne fan. I was surprised at how good it was. It is not your ""normal"" Wayne movie. In this one Jean Arth;ur plays the part of Molly Trousdale. She sets out from New York on a cross-country bus tour, because she wants to see America. When she gets out West she runs into Duke Hutkins (John Wayne), who is competing in a rodeo. Duke assumes she's just another pretty girl who wants to be with a rodeo star. But she is a lady who won't be roped easly. They keep meeting throughout the rest of the movie, with Duke following her to New York, (where she has three other men who love her), to win her back and takes her back out west. Needless to say, I liked the movie and give it 4 stars.RussPosted 02/23/2008"
3,A great find!,"This movie has a special place in my heart, as my husband is in it. We have not been able to find this movie - so it is a treat to have it. We just wish it were on DVD, but it's so old, we're just glad to have it in any format. The video is in great condition. Thank you."
5,Bargain-priced magic,"This CD is fantastic! All three concertos are very enjoyable and expertly played. The cello concerto and the violin concerto are great, but our favourite is the piano concerto, which sounds like it has a great first movement, no middle movement and 2 finales! If you don't know the work, when the second movement is running, you would swear it was the last movement ... until you hear the last movement, which is equally energetic.Beautiful! Highly recommended"
1,No Photos just Drawings,"I got this book out of my local library, and it has no actual photos of dragonflies. All the id images are colored in line drawings. They do no justice to what the actual animals look like, and several that I have actually seen, look nothing like the drawings in this book.You're better off finding ""A Field Guide to Dragonflies and Damselflies of Massachusetts"" by Blair Nikula, which features full color pictures of males and females of each species found in Massachusetts, including Cape Cod."
5,A better Turbine Cover,It has been difficult to find a turbine cover large enough for what I needed. I was very pleased to even find this item. This turbine cover is large enough and has a large throat (enables the cover to go over large turbines and still pull down to fit a small air shaft). well made and even looks good.
5,amazing kit,"I have nothing to say about this accesory pack other than how amazing it is. I have 3 maglites and these products work great. I have a maglite with each color lense, red for night vision, blue for fog/smoke, and clear for various uses. I only use one braket on 2 of my lights, mounted vertically. The 3rd maglite has the anti roll device on it. I must say that i am extremely happy with the purchase of this accessory pack and highly suggest it to anyone whom uses a maglite."
4,Nice brackets but clear and blue lenes of limited use,"I received the following in my package:>> 2 brackets w/ screws>> 1 anti-roll device>> 1 clear, red and blue lensThere was no amber lens and I have no use for either the clear or blue lenes. The red lens is useful to preserve night vision. It was impossible to get the red lens into one of my MagLites but the second one I tried offered little resistance.The brackets are strong enough to support two flashlights but you really have to make sure they are level. It is nice to know exactly where to find a flashlight when the power goes out."
5,Must have accessory kit,"The must have kit if you own a Maglite, stops it rolling away and stores safely when not in use"
3,"Good, but could be better","I think that mounting brackets are made of metal, but it are plastic. They appear to be a bit fragile, but only the time will confirm it. It's dangerous to crack it if you try use rivets, instead screws, to fix the brackets.I feel lack of a small box to protect the lens when not in use: I'm using a .22 air gun pellet tin to store it."
2,Mounting clips were useful.,"The bezel and mounting clips are useful. If you have D cell Mag-lites on a boat or vehicle that moves, this keeps your flashlight from rolling around. The mounting clips are made well and hold the flashlight in place. The plastic red clear and blue covers are not the greatest though. The red is not very red, the blue is not very blue and the white is not able to diffuse light much at all. Better to get a blue or red LED light if you need colored light and just use the clear filter already on the light. The clear one seems to have no purpose as it doesn't diffuse light enough. Better to just get the mounting clips yourself. The rubber bezel is good for keeping the light from rolling around, but will discolor and dirt will stick to it."
4,Accessories for your Mag Lite,This set is good as long as you use all of the accessories. I don't have a use for the colored lenses but I do use the Mounting Clips. I also fine the Anti-rolling rubber hood a nice bonus which I thought would end up at the bottom of my Junk drawer for the next ten years. Now I find I use it quite a bit. The clips are plastic and can snap if you are not careful. Spring steel coated in rubber would make for a much better and long lasting clip. But then I guess you wouldn't have to keep buying new ones. I actually mounted my Mag Lite to the lower console in my Chevy Truck on the driver side for easy/quick access. For me that is the perfect spot. My buddy mounted his to the inside of his Truck Toolbox. Depending on the heat and how you drive I suppose you could even mount it in your engine compartment for emergencies. Bottom line it's a good set and maybe I'll find a use for the pretty colored lenses at my next party.
5,Excellent product in original packaging,"This is the original maglite product in original packaging. The only pitfall exists by design. These are soo large, that there is nowhere to store them on the flashlight. Obviously, you can't use all three filters at once, so you need to think up your own storage solution."
5,No more rolling Maglite,"bought this product mainly for the mounting brackets, mounted it to the inner panel of my ""camping suburban"",installed the rubber head and red filter for night time use , now my maglite is handy when i need it."
3,Dynomax 33226 Stainless Steel Hardware Clamp,The bands look okay installed but lack sufficient clamping ability to prevent the exhaust pipe from moving inside the muffler. The band design does not allow it to clamp properly if there is any angle to the exhaust pipes entering into the muffler. I ultimately ended up using the U-bolt muffler clamp to secure the rear exhaust pipe inside the outlet of the muffler. My recommendation would be to save your money and just go with the standard U-bolt muffler clamp.
1,bad housing design,"1. it's difficult to swap hard drive with this enclosure.2. when ""unplug"" thru Windows, it won't spin down.3. Not just it won't spin down, it will ""reconnect"" again to Windows as if I just plug it back in."
4,"Works well, matches my Leviton Light Ivory plate","Works as expected. Doesn't have wire insertion connections, just screw posts. Has single connection for switch common. If it had wire insertion, I would have given it a 5."
2,Not as good as their debut,"Not nearly as musically interesting as their debut, self-titled, disc. On Looking Through, the tracks seem to blend together with no amazing standout tracks. I suppose you can give them props for not trying to hard to produce a single, but it feels like they didn't try to hard to produce any truly great songs.If you're new to PMM, get their self-titled disc. Looking Through is mostly for the hardcore fans who are mostly interested in supporting a band who showed tremendous potential with their first album."
5,keeps sweet cheeks safe in cold climates,"I love Mustela, their products are so baby friendly, and this is one of the best! We use this cold cream on our toddlers face ALL winter! One tube lasts a long time because so little is needed to get good coverage. The cream is not sticky or smelly but it gives my daughters cheeks the protection she needs from the harsh Minnesota climate. Thumbs up for Mustela!"
2,Belt and Ice Bag needs redeign,Poorly made belt and the weight of the ice pack drops the ice bag after wearing. The fill cap on the ice bag should be in an upright or other location.
4,A real oddball character!,"Wertham is truly a character... the way he describes comic books and other social entertainment is somewhat funny, gruesome, and arrogant. His comparisons are disturbing but his analogies make sense and carry on throughout the book! I bought this book to complete my research for a thesis paper on his views on society back then and his predictions of the future, in terms of how comics are affecting the minds of children and young adults, and, thanks to this book, I got an A on the paper. It's somewhat nostalgic and classic... A must own for any die-hard comic fan!"
4,What a piece of doo-doo!,"I only give this book a high rating because of its historic significance. Otherwise, Wertham is merely saying the same thing the NRA is saying fifty years later: its not the guns that killed those kids at Sandy Hook, it's the video games. And the rap music. And the comic books. Bear that in mind while reading."
5,Entertaining Book for Comic Fans,"This book is great to read but not for the reasons Mr. Wertham would like. In the 1950's, Wertham undertook a crusade to rid the world of comic books (yes, you read correctly) and chronicled his effort in this book. Wertham decided that comics (ALL comics) were destroyers of youth. To him, no comic book was benign. Superhero comics like Wonder Woman and Superman promoted white supremacy and homosexuality, Crime and Horror comics made kids into sadistic outlaws, etc. As a result of his book and efforts, comics were effectively neutered through the comics code. Granted some of the points Wertham made about the effects of graphic horror had on youngsters had merit, but most were far off the mark. This book is a must-read for anyone who loves comics and their history. It's also a great reference to find the most interesting comics of the 1950's."
4,"Wertham's work is humorous, but chilling.","This is it...the book that almost single-handedly destroyed the comic book industry in the 1950s, and basically rendered it inert for several decades. Dr. Frederic Wertham presents page after page of so-called scientific evidence that links comics to the perceived juvenile delinquency problems of the era. The thing is, most of his studies read like: ""Johnny shoplifts. He also reads comic books. Therefore, comic books cause Johnny to shoplift."" Similar arguments would be made by critics against television, film and even classic literature throughout the rest of the century, but Wertham started the trend with this book.A fascinating and necessary read, not just for comic fans, but free thinkers in general. Wertham's pro-censorship bent and McCarthyesque paranoia are always amusing, but also very frightening when one thinks about what could have happened to American society had his crusade ultimately succeeded."
5,Entertaining book especially for Comic Book lovers,"This book is great to read but not for the reasons Mr. Wertham would like. In the 1950's, Wertham undertook a crusade to rid the world of comic books (yes, you read correctly) and chronicled his effort in this book. Wertham decided that comics (ALL comics) were destroyers of youth. To him, no comic book was benign. Superhero comics like Wonder Woman and Superman promoted white supremacy and homosexuality, Crime and Horror comics made kids into sadistic outlaws, etc. As a result of his book and efforts, comics were effectively neutered through the comics code.

This book is a must-read for anyone who loves comics and their history. It's also a great reference to find the most interesting comics of the 1950's."
3,necklace and earring set,The four leaf clover necklace goes very well with the matching earrings. It is a perfect yet simple set. Now I am waiting for it to bring me luck when I wear them!
5,Husband loves these shoes.,"My husband claims these are very comfy. He's on his feet all day at a busy restaurant, and these support his feet, and have great traction."
5,My favorite shoe,"I loved the older original Boston with the dot rubber soles and super soft inner leather.These are a very close second, since I could not find the originals any more.These are a bit stiffer and take some break in period.They are still soft inside (but not as soft as the older ones were).I now own 4 pairs (2 of these, 1 black, and the originals).I wear them everywhere, including while snowblowing my 2-3 feet of snow (they are mostly waterproof and warm and somewhat slip resistant and can be stomped into hard ice covered snow)."
5,Nice Maglite Clip,Worth every cent. I mounted two sets of these in my camper to hold my D cell and AA cell maglites and they work very well.
5,Works great,"I own an Chevy Avalanche and saw another owner use this for a really cool place to mount the flashlight.I have a small flashlight mounted near the top (on the inside) of the compartment between the front seats. Keeps it from disappearing in the mess of junk in the compartment.Even better - Since the Avalanche has ""saddle bag"" compartments above and behind the rear wheels, I mounted a flashlight on the lid to the compartment so it's always easy to find/reach.Would work good on someone's workbench mounted on a wall rather than buried in a drawer."
3,"Okay, Flimsy",I wouldn't trust the baby screws it comes with directly into drywall. Either swap out for your own or mount it on solid wood. I feel like the mount will snap every time I pull the light out.
4,College kid music fan,"just got this system today and i think it is well worth the money. I watched Gladiator and the sound was bright, clear and very imersing. So far im very happy."
5,Great book,"I bought this book to review the techniques of composition in the 1900s. It gives ample to space to each development, along with many examples for each.Another great book to check out isRobert Morgan's ""Twentieth Century Music""."
5,Good extension for ps/2 devices,I keep my ps/2 keyboard around because some of the terminals in which I work are buggy using USB keyboards. This device really extends my keyboards reach and helps out at work.
1,Wrong item shipped?,"Thought I was purchasing Tripp Lite P222-015 PS/2 Keyboard/Mouse Extension Cable MinDIN6M/F - 15ft (male to female) cables for my nightvision camera system and received male to male (M/M) cables.Could not get any one to believe what I ordered because everything showed M/M (receipt, online order system etc.) Forgot about it until I received this email for a review. This was suppose to be shipped in about 3-4 weeks (back ordered) and even though I received in a week IT WAS THE WRONG ITEM.My full time job is as a web developer and I believe they changed their systems to get me the wrong item or they are screwed up in their ordering system.Watch what you order and you may not get quite what you wanted."
4,Cool to say the least,"This was a very interesting recording. First, the choice of programming was different. Ponthus paired Xenakis and Ravel together. However, he uses excellent discretion when playing the two radically different composers. They both have a certain melancholy, I guess. There is really no word to describe it. The music is kind of somber, even in the most passionate parts. I think that is what the performer saw in both Ravel's and Xenakis's music. Overall, an excellent CD."
4,FUN!,"This is the first book in this batch by Sandra Chastain- the hero here the world famous photographer gets sucked into helping out his sister's friend when she needs a husband.See Bettina has a company that provides imaginary boyfriends and husbands for women who need to appear attached but don't want to be... and since her brother travels so much and is never in Atlanta she uses her brothers' pictures as the ones for her clients.So when brother dearest is in town and Anne needs help==== he agrees and the hilarity, passion, fun and general goofy warm mushy stuff follows. This one is warm and fun- read the sequel Look But Don't Touch to see how the other brother gets set up by his sister!"
2,Lasted about a year,"Can't speak for other's experiences with this product,but I treated it VERY carefully(always pulled it out of jacks by the plug,not pulling on the cord)& it started to cut out after about a year of intermitent use.Treating it the way I did,I expected it to last longer-MUCH longer!"
3,Not exactly what I needed,The plastic end is surprisingly thick and would not work unaltered with my headphones. I had to trim a large amount of plastic back to make these fit.
4,"Good, but not heavy-duty.","I bought this particular brand because of the name and the appearance of the sample picture. It looked like a good heavy duty cable that justified 2x the price of a cheap cable. What I got is just a cheap cable. It works, but it's no better than the no-name brand cables at half this price."
1,Very dense book,Got this book for a Christian Ethics Class. The book is basically the US Bishops view on our economic policy. Very dry read as well as repetitive.
1,Fools Gold,"I bought this cable on amazon so my roommates could hook their computers up to my Samsung LCD HDTV, as their computers do not have HDMI outputs (if you have the option of HDMI, use it). I was sold on this cable because it was affordable AND gold plated - as most people know, gold conducts electrical signals better than most metals. However, let me be the first to tell you that this cable conducts an electrical signal like it was made out of woven horse hair; though I doubt horse hair would display such horrible ghosting (aka double imaging). I am an easily satisfied person. If something works well, i'm happy... and this just doesn't. Don't buy it."
1,Bad quality signal - don't buy it,"I bought this cable to connect my laptop to a 21"" screen. The video signal quality is really bad, and my eyes hurt after 10 min. I work with it. The same laptop, the same screen, and an old cable I borrowed from a colleague of mine work perfectly."
1,Impossible to Win,"Thought this would be a great game, but no such luck. First off, you can't customize the controls, AT ALL - Strike One. Then, somewhere around the 4th level you get to a scene that is UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE to get beyond - Strike Two and this game is out. Avoid this game unless you like pulling your hair out in utter frustration..."
4,Hunt for the Gold,"Sara Woods' ENTER THE CORPSE is a traditional British style mystery.The black sheep of the family Mr. Hubert Denning is being released from prison where he has been serving a term for robbery. He has nowhere to go and is taken in by his god-son Roger Farrell. Before Denning even reaches the home Roger and his actress wife, Meg Hamilton, discover the body of one of Denning's former 'employees' in the hall of their home.Roger begs the help of his friend barrister, Antony Maitland, to find out who killed the man and also to manage to keep the matter out of the papers.Gold bullion excites the greed of many underworld characters who know Denning stashed some of his last haul away for safe keeping.A good read with plenty excitement to take to the beach or the dentist office.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
5,This is a flash light!,Great flash light with an adjustable beam and great range. I have two of them and use them frequently. A real quality product.
2,"Slow, doesn't hover well on land, sank after 15 mn of play","My son's best friend got one of those for christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son's regular RC boat. The hovercraft was very slow and not quite that maneuverable. It hovered OK on water, but couldn't handle sand or concrete. The ""skirt"" slipped out of its track a couple times (despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could), filling with water - the foam inside it didn't prevent the boat from being swamped by the smallest wave (even in good shape it couldn't handle waves like the other boat.) The thin skirt finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now. Big disapointment. It was somewhat fun while it worked, the concept was intriguing for the gearhead boys, but once the novelty wore off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids prefered taking turns running that one."
2,Save your money,"I purchased this product for my six year old. The first one I received did not work at all (the main fan was borken). Amazon promptly replaced it, and after the initial charging, we were up and running. The run time is very short (about 10 minutes). The hovercraft does not get much lift, nor does it move particularly fast. It has difficulty moving over all but the very smoothest of surfaces. On the second day, my son accidently touched one of the rear fan blades while under power, and it snapped right off. On a separate occasion, we put the hovercraft (dry) on our kitchen counter, and the rubber skirt left a chemical stain that would not come off no matter how hard we tried. Finally, it was removed by a great product called ""goof off"", but still a slight hint of the stain remains. I would reccomend you save your money and your counter top."
1,Very Dissapointing,"We purchased this item for our five year old for Christmas. Although it does work OK in the house on wooden floors, the battery seems to be very short lived (maybe 15 minutes). Using it on snow is almost impossible as it appears that the battery life is even shorter.We accidently touched one of the prop blade when it was outdoors and it snapped off. We've been trying to find a replacement blade but have had no responses from the manufacturer or seller.Without a doubt, we would not buy this product again."
5,Love it!,Love this scent. I receive compliments every time I wear it about how great I smell. Product was delivered exactly as if bought in the store but for much less money.
4,my review,"I gave four stars because the box was very battered, this was a gift and I was very disappointed with the box, but other than that everything else was good."
4,Nice!,I brought this perfume for my cousin as a gift and she loved it. It was a great buy. It has a nice fragrance making it very good for girls :)
2,Poorly printed,"We(and our son) like many Baby Einstein products, but this book is just too poorly printed to enjoy. The picture sections under the liftable flaps are so dark and murky that they are almost unrecognizable."
3,Also Wanting....waiting...,"Me too! I would buy this in an instant. And while you're at it get ""The Day the universe Changed""."
1,Incomplete Order,We only received one disk of a five disk set. Please correct. It is extremely difficult to reach a real person to settle this problem. We are severely tested by the limited options of communicating with amazon.
2,Boring Episodes,"I really enjoyed James Burke's first series, ""The Day the Universe Change"". Then he did Connections I, II and III. Connections I was decent. However, Connections II and III were less than interesting. Because each episode was so boring, I often quit watching them before getting to the end. Definitely not worth the price of $80. In fact, knowing what I now know, even $15 is too much for II and III."
2,Broke First time,Clip is weak at base. Mounted one above the other.One broke the first time I tried to remove the C-Cell flashlight.
1,they broke,"They broke just a couple weeks after I got them, you would think that for the money they would at least last a little while. Gee Whiz."
5,great accessory,Ever wish that your flashlight was where you wanted it to be? These clips do the trick. Easy to mount and great functionality. Great product!
5,Captivating first novel,"Owl Goingback leapt onto my favorites list with this first novel. This is a tale of Native American legend as fact that I had not seen this well done since Cruz's Nightwing.A legendary monster it loosed from its earthly bonds thanks to an earthquake and thus the horror begins. This book starts in tenth gear and still manages to pick up speed and the horror gets kicked up a few notches.It is very rare to see a horror novel so well executed especially one that involves a monster. But even with a monster as a plot device, Owl Goingback does not skimp on the suspense and the settings.One of the best horror novels of the year (maybe THE best, but there are a few I didn't read). If you like them creepy and scary, you have to read this one."
3,over rated and underwhelming,"At heart, this is a very pedestrian monster run amok story. The book waffles between depicting the creature as some sort of prehistoric survivor and an evil spirit. It ends up being just another aimlessly nasty beasty. The plot is predictable. For instance, you can tell who will survive by who has native american ancestry. There is some gore spattered here and there in the usual fashion. There is the predictable inclusion of a stamement on the evils of white men and the virtues of the native american. This sentiment is included in the fate of the characters (see above). This is almost a paint by numbers monster story. Even the climactic battle with the creature lacks punch because it is so predictable."
1,"Unreadable ""horror""","I have read a lot of horror books the past years. I think this is the worst of them all. Bad written, terrible character descriptions and a story that is impossible to like. Very naiv, shallow and bad plot through out the entire book. OK, maybe he can be excaused since this is a first novel from Mr Goingback. You cannot call it a horror book. I was not at least terrified by it. Writers like Richard Matheson, Graham Masterton, Peter Straub and Stephen King can really enchant a reader in horror. On the cover of my paperback copy it said ""Winner of the Bram stoker award"" I cannot believe how that can be true. However I will try to read some of his recent books and see if he has made any progress in how to make a readable horror novel. But take my advice. This book is not worth spending time on."
3,Syndication Edition?,"As a series Connections 2 is Amazing, and if I were only reviewing the program I would give it five stars. However after I bought this DVD I noticed some of the scenes were missing, and after a little research I found out that the source used in the making of this DVD set was the syndicated version of the program. I also own this program on VHS which had the original version so that's how I was able to notice the difference. It might seem like a nit pick, but the bits that are missing I thought added to the personality of the program. I would still recommend this DVD set as it is still really good, but I'm hoping for a ""special edition"" or something to be released with the whole program intact."
2,Nowhere near as good as Connections 1,"The production value and overall quality of this version of Connections is inferior to the first series in my opinion. It also repeats information already covered in the first but in a less interesting way. There is also more commentary being interjected that the first series was better off without, although there was some in the last show of that series too."
2,Less than the earlier series,"I really enjoyed James Burke's first series, ""The Day the Universe Change"". Then he did Connections I, II and III. Connections I was decent. However, Connections II and III were less than interesting. Because each episode was so boring, I often quit watching them before getting to the end. Definitely not worth the price of $80. In fact, knowing what I now know, even $15 is too much for II and III."
5,Wonderful collection,I was hooked as soon as I saw one episode years ago. Had to have the whole collection
3,OK. We finally get started!,"As Mr Parker so eloquently wrote, this is but a small beginning for what many of us hope will end up in a 'Tull' book that does this incredible band, and it's fans, justice.I feel NO band has ever taken the listener to the places Tull has. And they have done that all under the 'guise' of excellant musicianship, one-of-a-kind lyrical genuis, and kick butt rock and roll.So...I must agree that the work is fair, but not what some of us are looking for as the 'definitive work' for Jethro Tull, especially at the price. You see we 'still got something on my mind.'"
1,Not a biography at all,"If you don't know a thing about Tull, you'll be lost in the first few pages. If you know a little, you'll still be lost in the first few pages. Even if you know a bunch about Tull, this thing becomes a tedious, plodding through the mind of an avid fan, all too eager to wave his back-stage pass in your face. I do hope one day someone will write a real biography on Tull; indeed, one of the great rock bands to emerge from the 60's. Perhaps Mr Anderson could get someone like Peter Guralnick or David Ritz to do a real biography. Until then, don't waste your money on this. You'll get much the same information by investing in one of the box sets (plus, you'll get something to listen to)."
2,It could be worse,"I suppose if one knows nothing about Tull, this comprehensive overview could be very useful. If, however, you're a fan and already know the basic history, there is much less here than one might want. First, much is recycled from other sources. Second, the desciptions of the albums are far too subjective. Descriptive analysis of the music would have been worthwhile, but Nollen's opinions (and even worse, recycled reviews from Rolling Stone and the like) are unnecessary. Does anyone really care whether or not Nollen likes a particular album? A true history of the band, something that would detail the creation of the various songs, their instrumentation and studio techniques, how they relate to Ian Anderson's life, the details of their tours with descriptions of the staging, etc., i.e., something that does for Tull what ""The Last Gang In Town"" did for The Clash has, sadly, yet to be written."
4,A swashbuckling adventure,The Great Quest is an old fashioned high adventure page turner. It starts slowly but is well worth wading through the slow start. A little maudlin at times but overall good escapist entertainment. Whomever converted it from print should have proof read it. There were quite a few typos.
1,Awful CD and misrepresents Brecker's involvement,"From looking at the cover, you'd think that Michael was one on every track, or at least most of them. In fact, he plays on maybe 4 of the 16 tracks, one of which is entirely EWI with no soloing. The tunes are all original by a German composer and all sound very very dated. It sounds much more like a smooth jazz album (complete with bell piano!). Many of the songs barely have a solo section (including the ones with Brecker). The label or composer basically gathered some of the world's greatest soloists at the top of their game and then refused to let them do what they do best. The mixing of the album is not stellar. If you like anything by Michael Brecker, Mike Stern or Peter Erskine, you'll most likely not like anything about this album. There's a reason that no songs on the album can be previewed before purchase. if I could return it, I would."
3,A little on the dry side,"Average to good performances of these works, but the performance sounds like it was recorded in a warehouse rather than a church or concert hall. Hate to say it, but this ensemble is good, but not good enough to overcome bad acoustics. Zukerman is one of my favorite violinists, but his work with Barenboim better reflects his capabilties than does this recording."
3,Works but...,"It is important to allow the unit to dry completely before reusing. If water gets into the vacuum pump, it will not draw a vacuum until it dries. Once it dries out, it works fine."
1,piece of junk,"The third time I tried to use this, the vacuum stopped working and a chunk of rubber gasket protruded from the pump. I can find no way to contact Grill tek, the maker of this for repair. Save your money!! Buy a ziploc bag for marinating--you'll get a better result for a lot less$$$!!"
1,Not Impressed,"I received this as a gift and was excited to put it to good use. Unfortunately, on my first attempt it broke. I was using it just as the directions said, nothing out of the ordinary, and all of a sudden the plunger went from about medium (since a vacuum was being created) to very easy where it just felt like I was pushing a spring. The plunger broke that fast, and since it was broken, the device would no longer create a vacuum.Oh well, at least I now have a rectangular shaped clear plastic container with a lid that can hold perishable items.If you want to vacuum marinade, save your money and shop for something else."
2,Worked OK For Two Years,"It worked OK for two years, then the vacuum pump ceased working. It's molded in and can't be repaired. I prefer the marinators that use the wine cork pumpdown system. At least if the cork goes bad, you can use another one.I don't recommend washing the base in the dishwasher. Polycarbonate is hygroscopic and will absorb water at elevated temperatures, which embrittles it and will eventually lead to failure under vacuum."
1,One time use,I got it as a gift. I used it once and the gasket around the plunger broke. I don't see any way to replace it.
4,A Child On Her Own,"For Kelly Rowland, she had a whole lot to prove as being one-third of Destiny's Child. Nevertheless, she already proved it with her first solo record, Simply Deep. The first single of the album, Stole, is a very crafty and difficult song to really talk about. It talks about people often saying bad things about kids and ignoring them constantly, and seeing what could've happened to them if they were treated differently. When I saw the video for this song, I just shed a couple of tears for a personal reason I could relate to that song. Many people think that Beyonce Knowles was the whole package of Destiny's Child, largely because she was the lead vocalist, but when I heard Kelly on her own, it was amazing."
3,An interesting read,"This book reveals how complexity theory (CT) can be used in today's complicated organization. However, it lacks the tools on how to achieve what it intends to do. The steps and levels of organization 'maturity' described by author is clear. It has interesting sections and good lessons to teach. The book does not stand on its own. It needs help from other disciplines to put the plan into reality. Perhaps, readers may find more in Theory of Constraints than what is expected in Complexity theory in business world at this point in time."
5,Every LNC should have this book!!,"Marketing for the Legal Nurse Consultant is the most valuable book in my library! The Joos' walk LNCs through the world of marketing with ease. I've been lucky enough to have met these fine people in person and attended their marketing seminars. Here again, this is a ""must do"" for the independent legal nurse consultant. My cards and brochures went through major overhauls with their help and my business has prospered! Thank you both, John and Betty, for all you do! I'm looking forward to purchasing your next edition."
5,great kit!,"Aside from the stock heads being lousy this kit is pretty good. I bought this set about 5 months ago, fitted it with Evans Hydraulic heads, an Emad bass head and I haven't looked back! One word to the wise, before you assemble your kit, go and tighten every screw on the hardware before you put the heads on. I've found 3 screws that fell out after only a short time which becomes a pain when you have everything tuned just right. I've since added the accent 8"" and 10"" tom expansion pack and now I have a kit that blows my mind! definitely a good buy for the price!"
2,Not the best malted milk ball I ever had,"While my family enjoyed these malted milk balls and they were generally good, I expected more when I ordered them. I guess my biggest complaint would be that the chocolate was kind of waxy so it didn't have a nice mouth feel and didn't melt as you ate the malted milk ball."
3,The good and the bad...,"Would have been 5 stars but it shipped in two ziplock bags, and when I picked up one of the bags, it broke open.Lost a quarter of my order upon reciept.Taste was good, packaging was terrible."
1,Bad Design,I expected that the front of this holder would be velcro in order to keep the flap down but the back loop for the belt is velcro also??? I tried several times but it kept falling off my belt over time because when you pull up the velcro front flap it loosens the velcro on the belt loop. So now I have to see if I can get the belt loop stitched.
4,John Cena,"Great gift, cannot wait to give this to my son! The product is well made and well sealed. Thank you"
1,john cena is a fake and a fraud & a hack,this dvd is a waste of time and money this wrestler does not know how to wrestle at all ever since wwe has gone downhill and went pg wrestling is and never will be the same the wwe is losing alot of money and is alkso losing in the ratings the wwe should just go out of business since i heard how low the ratings are
1,a look into a wrestler who does not know how to wrestle,"this guy is annoying not only does he stink but hes annoying on the mic if you like wwe now their is something wrong with you i now know why wwe is doing alot of ppvs in one year because they are losing alot of money not to mention what vince tryed getting his wife a senate seat wow thats the biggest low blow in wrestling history heck wwf went into pg mode after my favorite wrestler died in which is kind of lame im sorry john cena but you are a fake,fraud and of course a hack"
2,selection switch not working,"Yes, this must be the brightest flashlight that I've ever seen. However to select how many of the leds are lite you must move a micro switch...a switch that is not accessible unless you dissemble the light.Not only is that really unreasonable the switch in the light I received did NOTHING. The only mode of operation is for ALL 3 leds to be ON. A huge waste of batteries."
5,Word of God in English,This book made me think about my Bible translation and the interpretation that goes into the translation process. The writing was easy to read and understand and well presented. I heartily recommend this to anyone that is serious about Bible study and is interested in knowing what is behind the words they are reading.
5,Outstanding Work!,"I had a read a later work by Mr. Ryken on this subject which extracted material from this earlier book. So, when I saw I could buy this volumn and read more widely, I jumped at the chance. The NIV has always made me uneasy, as I was never sure what the original Hebrew and Greek said, and had to check it out. But, to make the matter more serious, so many churches and para-church organizations were using it almost exclusively. Mr. Ryken did a great job of exposing the true nature of the 'translation', using rigorous methods. I came away with an even greater appreciation of actual translations like ESV and NASB, and a real wariness about dynamic or functional equivalence."
2,hmmm,"Well, Hits of the Year is one of the finest Squeeze singles and this CD holds a soft spot in my heart since, I think, it's the product of their first reunion back around '84-'85 or so. I'll admit now that I've listened to it in its entirety maybe twice and not recently. If I'd loved it, I would know that now as I write this and I don't. But like anything else, I'll give it another shot sometime soon, see if it's aged any better than the first reviewer above believes.First rate punny CD cover though."
2,Creepy. Dreamland is too scary for Preschoolers.,"My three year old daughter loves Care Bears, and she likes to watch this collection of three short stories. However, I feel this entire DVD is really creepy. The first story starts with ""monsters"" hiding in a little girl's closet -- jumping out to scare her once her Mommy leaves the room. The other stories demonstrate really poor writing, and strike me really as rather creepy. If you want your preschooler to sleep in his or her own bed, then I suggest you skip this title."
1,RIDICULOUSLY SCARY FOR PRE-SCHOOLERS,I cannot believe that this DVD is marketed as a DVD to put children to sleep - It's enough to give them nightmares! Two minutes into the DVD a blue creepy villain appears and the whole CD has villains in it - It scared my 3 year old so much she still talks about it. Do not buy this DVD. I cannot emphasis this enough!
4,another fun book by Jennifer Weiner,"I enjoyed this book, it was different from her other books but still very entertaining and engrossing. I find it kind of unrealistic though that a ""housewife"" would be able to solve a crime before the police but once I got pass that I really liked it. My favorite character though was Jane. I would love to read a whole book about her. Happy Reading!!"
3,Night Night,"I loved the In Her Shoes Movie so much, I ran out and bought this book. But this book felt like a Lifetime show. As a ""big girl"" and a Mom, I was hoping to love the book. Oh well!"
1,Stupidest book I've ever read,"Period. Really, the worst crap I've ever finished reading. You can criticize me for finishing it. It was that bad."
3,"Not her best, but decent reading","I think what sticks out the most about Jennifer Weiner's books are her characters. Here, however, there are too many. I just couldn't keep track of all the different mommies and ""older men"". The ending was good...I was surprised over it. But I feel like for such a long book (with too many flashbacks) that I should have gotten a true ending, not a possible sequel.I think she could have written a book on just the flashbacks alone.Good in Bed is her best work. Read that one first."
3,Not her best work.....,"I LOVED Jennifers other books so far (Little Earthquakes, Good in Bed, and In Her Shoes) but this was a let-down. There are other reviews with more detailed information, so I won't go into detail. I will just say that things are not wrapped up, and characters are not fully developed, for my taste. And again, I love this authors other books, so this was a suprise dissapointment."
2,She should have rethought this,"I loved her other books, but this one, I cannot get through it. It is trite and so far from her other books. She did the single girl thing so well that when I picked this up, I didn't buy this married woman who is so run-down.I just feel that this wife and mom is/was a writer and usually that requires a bit of 'don't care' attitude. I just keep trying to get through this mess and this time her strong wrtiting skills is not saving it."
3,"Nobody, Somebody, Anybody?","I enjoyed this book right up to the ending. I don't want to give it away but i have to say that it was a little too far-fetched. The premise and the characters were entertaining and the story itself moved along fairly well. And it was equipped with interpersonal relationships galore; romance, friendships, parenting, co-workers. It was mysterious and fun but it was also at times a bit cheesy. This is the only book that i've read by Weiner and with all the hype I assumed it would be better. I don't want to say it was bad because it wasn't all bad. Parts of the story were very well written but some parts just seemed thrown together and little too over-done. But again, I suggest that you give it a try because i'm only one person and someone else might love it."
3,Not her best...,"I have read several of her books (my favorite is Little Earthquakes) and this one was my least favorite. The story is good enough, makes me want to keep reading I guess, but I just felt like she was trying to write something she wasn't very good at. There were almost too many ""trying too hard twists"" and ""gotcha"" moments for me. I didn't really care about the characters very much. I think we should've loved the main character more from the beginning, but all she did was whine about her new home, her kids, and her marriage. I understand she felt like a ""nobody"" but at least try a little harder to make her likeable Jennifer!"
2,Gave up at Chapter 10,"I didn't enjoy this book at all. Normally, I love Jennifer Weiner (Good in Bed is one of my lifetime favorites); but Goodnight Nobody left me bored and unconcerned about who murdered Kitty.Sorry, Jen, but this was NOT one of your best. I wish I would have saved my $26.00 & bought Chinese takeout instead."
2,biting the hand that feeds her,"Weiner is writing this book for whom? The suburban housewife who she maligns throughout the book. Are the cool NYC people she talks about reading her book? Her characters are stock. The perfect rich bigoted lily white Fairfield County CT WASPS. Oh please.That said, the main character is likable, and I was page turning despite my opposition to the characterization of suburbia.However, the ending is ridiculous, and the last two pages are perhaps the dumbest ever. How did her editors not chop off those two pages?"
2,"I love you JW, but","To my most favorite author in the world: I love you, but stick to what you're good at (mysteries it ain't!). DO NOT start you're adventure into Jennifer Weiner's world with this novel. I hate to say it because I dearly love her and cannot get enough of her books, but holy cow this was a bad one. I didn't want to finish it. I guessed who did it before the book ended. I kept waiting for it to redeem itself, but nothing ever happened. I was delighted to see that she managed to get her original proposed title ""Momicide"" into the book somewhere. However, that was the only funny part. Please give us another book soon JW so we can put this one behind us."
3,Just Okay,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I found it boring and got tired of hearing how ""pudgy"" and drab Kate was. The only interesting character in the book was Janie, Kate's best friend, and I even got tired of the references made to her money. If you want to read it, I recommend getting it from the library and saving your money."
2,Annoying,"I've read ""In Her Shoes"" which I enjoyed, but this latest one became more annoying with each page.The character is nothing original. She's been done before: An educated thirtyish woman who feels she is trapped with her kids in the suburbs. Add to this a really obnoxious,loudmouthed friend and three toddlers (including a four year old who acts forty) and you have the makings of a so-so story that's been done many times before.I found Kate to be an extreme busybody and wouldn't blame her husband for leaving her. Her ""humorous"" side remarks were tiresome and I didn't really care for her or her immature pinings for a man who was never a boyfriend to begin with.I hope the author picks a more interesting character to develop in her next novel."
2,nothing special,"I really wanted to like this book, especially after reading her first three books and loving them. Unfortunately, this book was nothing special. I didn't really like Kate or her whining.After hitting three out of the park I would rule this one a double. It reminded me of Susan Isaccs ""Compromising Positions.""Save your $$$$ - if you really want to read it, get it out of the library."
1,Terrible!,"Sorry - I really wanted to like this - but it's terrible - don't even bother to pick it up - if you do, you'll probably give it up by page 50."
1,A Book that Makes You Feel Cheated,"I've been a fan of Jennifer Weiner since Good in Bed. But the books seem to get stupider each time, and Goodnight Nobody was a new low.The story of New Yorker Kate Klein trying to fit into her new suburban surroundings was unoriginal and plodding. Some scenes seemed straight out of Tom Perotta's Little Children; at other times, Weiner seemed to be challenging Susan Isaac's Compromising Positions. Except, the problem for Weiner is both those books are better.I'm sure Weiner has it in her to write another great book. But her faithful and adoring readers are going to lose interest if she writes another Goodnight Nobody.I read the book quickly; it was written in her wry, observant style and she has a certain flair. But overall, it was a disappointing effort."
2,What Was She Thinking? So disappointed!,"I just finished this book and my first thought was: what????There was not enough resolution for me. Some of the ""mystery"" was solved, but not the personal conflict that Kate had. Am I supposed to write my own ending?Jennifer's writing, descriptive and colorful as always, was again a treat, but I do not recommend this book."
2,I was disappointed,This was the first time I read a novel by Jennifer Weiner. I was expecting a laugh a minute but didn't get it. Sure there was plenty of humorous dialog and funny situations. I did laugh! But I tired of the descriptions of baggy pants and XL sweaters midway through. Kate was defined by her poor fashion sense and her inability to cook. None of the characters had enough guts to them to keep me interested. And the end was so dark and disturbing it made me wonder what the point was.One Clown Short
3,Eh...,"I have enjoyed Weiner's books in the past so I was looking forward to this read but, unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait.I didn't find the story line believable and I kept thinking... that wouldn't actually happen- who does that?! The ending also left me wanting more."
2,Substitute Writer,"The book starts out like any other Jennifer Weiner novel--witty, well written and a joy to read. However, about half way through, it is as if someone else sat down at Weiner's desk and finished the book (and not well, I might add). The storyline just faded away and there was little wittiness in the second half. Very disappointing and I am a fan."
3,Good but not great.,"I liked the book. I did not love it. It's an o.k. book if you need something light to read, like on an airplane or car trip, but it's not very compelling. The story was weak and the characters silghtly plain. The one good thing about the book is that it provides some humourous insights into suburbia."
4,Very enjoyable!,This is a perfect romping beach read. I literally read it on the beach and it kept me engaged and entertained. Very fun.
2,A Moronic Heroine,"Kate, a Columbia grad, is nonetheless unbearably stupid: 1. When the neighbor she's been crushing on makes a drunken pass at her, then retreats in embarrassment and apologies, she takes this as a terrible betrayal, flees the country and harbors illwill toward him for years. Huh? 2) She marries someone because he is ""appropriate"". 3) She gets pregnant again when her firstborn is 3 months old. 4. Instead of hiring a nanny and getting a job, she mopes through life as a suburban mommy, bemoaning her wasted days, as if her old life writing gossip for a tabloid was in any way meaningful. What a tedious woman."
2,Goodnight No Thanks,"I have to agree that this is a somewhat lackluster book. The protagonist, Kate Klein, is the prototypical Jennifer Weiner main character: thirtyish, Jewish, overweight, inappropriately (verging on annoyingly) clownish, and caught between the professional world and domestic concerns.The book is basically a chick-lit murder mystery. As with other Weiner stories, it conflates the fantastical and outlandish with the mundane, a formula that doesn't feel natural to me at all (e.g., when put on the spot at Kitty's funeral, Kate ends up singing ""If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands"" during a misguided eulogy--so over-the-top and not very funny).I find most of Weiner's characters to be uneven and underdeveloped, and Goodnight Nobody's are no exception. I am done with Weiner, and I am still trying to understand her overwhelming commercial success and critical appeal."
2,Not terrible...,"I'm not sure what to say about this book. I went in with very low expectations (just wanted something light to read when I was in bed with the flu) and I guess ""Goodnight, Nobody"" met those low expectations. The characters weren't particularly interesting and the whole murder mystery was so far-fetched it was almost unbelievable but, on the other hand, I did keep turning the pages, and I smiled once or twice."
2,Deja Vu,"If you've read Susan Isaac's ""Compromising Positions,"" you've read this book. Not sure whether it was deliberately done but if felt like entire scenes were lifted intact. I was surprised and disappointed. I've enjoyed this writer's other books."
2,Not Jennifer Weiner's best work,"I have enjoyed Ms. Weiner's previous novels, but this book was not what I have come to expect from her writing. The characters were boring. The plot did not keep me intrigued. The brief bits of humor felt forced.I don't recommend this book. I'm sorry that I spent my money on it.Don't buy this book expecting it to be like her previous ones, because you'll be disappointed like I was!"
3,Not for the mystery buff.,"It is hard for me to write a review of this without spoiling the ending, as her resolution left me cold, but I will not write a spoiler. I've read all of Weiner's novels, and in usual Weiner style, certain of the characters here were entertaining. But, there was not enough character development, particularly of the men who all seemed like caricatures. Why did Evan do any of the things he did? And the murder mystery was thin, at best. Do not buy this book if you are looking for good mystery. It seemed she got to the end, and cobbled together a resolution to the murder mystery. I was also unsatisfied with and disappointed in her resolution (?) of the Kate/Evan storyline. If you just want a quick read, its not a total waste of time, but its not as good as Good in Bed."
2,Terribly disappointing...,"I liked the book... up until the ending. Why? Because it didn't end! It just sort of drifted away and you were left wondering what happened.It won't stop me from reading any new Jennifer Weiner novels when they come out. But, it will stop me from recommending this particular book to anyone."
2,First disapointment with Weiner,"Typically a huge fan of Jennifer Weiner's writing, I snapped up this book the day it came out. This book, while well-written, reminded me why I am not interested in crime or who-done-it novels. I thoroughly enjoyed the parts of Kate Klein's life that was predictable - kids, not fitting into her suburb, a workaholic husband. I could have done without the dozens of ""interviews"" she performed in order to solve Kitty's murder. I simply lost interest in who killed Kitty and frankly, wanted the book to veer back to the preschool politics that made me laugh. I was also frustrated by the storyline of Evan being left open - there was no closure to that situation at all, which was disapointing.Weiner should stick to dependable chick-lit and leave the murder mysteries to another aisle at the bookstore."
4,Good book - I'd actually rate it 4 1/2 stars!,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm very surprised at some of the other reviews. I too was disappointed that we didn't get an ending with a solution to her love life, but hopefully, that leaves room for another ""murder mystery"" book featuring Kate, her husband, her lost love and her best friend. I thought it was charmingly funny, and I liked the closeness with her best friend, however, not Janie's interference in Kate's love life. Too devious and over the top. All in all, though, a book I would definitely recommend!"
2,not appealing as her others,"I have read some of her other books and I believe this one was not up to the others. I found the character very ""whiney"" and not very redeeming. This book seemed more ""cookie cutter"" and not as funny and/or clever as her others. I was disappointed-especially in the ending and her choices."
3,Wanted so much to like it...,"and DID like it for 3/4 of the book. Then the plot ran all over the place with outrageous twits. It's as if Ms. Weiner didn't know how to end it, so she came up with a Lifetime-like conclusion that was not at all plausible. Her other books are better."
2,Glad I did not buy it,"I LOVED Jennifer Weiner's other books so when i heard that she had another book coming out, I was excited. This book was disappointing in contrast to In Her Shoes, Good in Bed and Little Earthquakes. Those were the kinds of books that you want to recommend to a friend and make sure that you have copy of on the shelf. I'm glad that i rented this one from the library and spent my money on the latest Diana Gabaldon and Robert Jordan instead. However while it was a fun read, her characters were not as interesting as the characters in her other books. Almost felt like she was somehow trying to badly put a Desperate Housewives twist into the literary world. I would not recommend this book but I would reccomend ANY of her other books. Fans of hers would also like Lorna Landvik and Sophie Kinsella"
2,Not what I expected,"A good friend recommended this book to me, so I was really surprised to find it predictable and sitcommy."
3,pretty easy reader,I really enjoy this authors books however this was my least favorite of her books.
3,Disappointing - not her best,"I am a fan of Weiner's other books, and was very disappointed in this one. Story was good, but the attempt at political suspense fell flat. The liberal leanings of this book made it difficult to connect with her characters. This was not the case in her other books. I suggest she stick with the chick lit and leave the politics out."
3,"Average read, interesting viewpoint.","This is not a bad book nor an indifferent book, but it could have been ""oh so much better""! Well written so far as language and placement go, interesting characters, not too badly drawn, but lacking in depth at some level. As though there are not enough time or pages to do them justice, unless you are in this place; a young woman, a mother, moved out of her comfort zone and into an unfamiliar environment, take a pass on this book. Ms. Weiner is a good writer and has several better books, look for one of them instead."
2,"Goodnight, Period.","I am a little confused as to why Weiner, one of the hottest writers today, felt it necessary to try her hand at a mystery. After the raucous success of ""In Her Shoes,"" ""Good In Bed,"" and ""Little Earthquakes,"" I expected her to keep moving on the same vein -- and I was excited about it.But this book doesn't make the grade set by her previous three best-sellers. The mystery is clunky, the characters annoying, and the plot disjointed. This was a strange attempt at a new genre. Let's hope Weiner returns to her familiar -- and lush -- territory and leaves the mystery writing to others."
1,Goodnight Jennifer Weiner,"This book was a colossal disapointment after having recently read ""Good in Bed"". The plot is stupid, the characters are implausible, and the relationships make no sense.I think that the publisher must have given her a fat advance because of her other great books, and she let us all down. A talent like Ms. Weiner should take her time and craft a better story.I wish that I could get a refund for this book."
3,"A true Jennifer Weiner Book, just not quite up to par.","I loved all three of the other Jennifer Weiner books that I've read. I was very excited to read this latest one. It's very easy to read, as all of her other ones were also. Yet the content kind of left me feeling slighted at the end. As a wife and mother I like to read books where I can empathize with the situation. While there were definitely some parts where I did ""feel her pain,"" I just found the whole thing to be utterly impossible. It felt like the author was reaching for action a lot in this book. I don't even know what happened between the wife and husband, or between the wife and ex-love in the end. All in all, this was a good book, worth the read. But I just hope that Weiner's next book is a little more believable."
4,a winner by Weiner,the product came as advertised and it's proven to be a winner by Weiner - thanks much to the vendor
2,An unfortunate occurrence,"Like many readers here, I'm a big fan of this author, however, her latest books have been very disappointing. I wish she would stick to her original writing style and format and not try to recreate the wheel - it's not necessary. I will continue reading any forthcoming books from Ms. Weiner, but will only get them either from the library or as a free Kindle. I hate giving this 2 stars because she is such a talented writer, but reviews should be honest."
2,Didn't caare for this one.,"This is my first Jennifer Weiner novel and it may well be my last. I really did not care for this book at all, mainly due to a central character who was completely unsympathetic and unlikeable. I did not like Kate Klein at all, and found her an unbelievable character, amongst a host of unbelievable people who populate this novel. I was very disappointed, as I can see that Weiner is a talented writer, but this novel just fell flat for me, and the ending was terrible. It read like a rushed contractual obligation that she had to churn out to satisfy her publisher. Not recommended."
1,Susan Isaacs should sue (no pun intended),"This is such a rip-off of Isaac's 'Compromising Positions.'Intelligent, educated woman who loves her kids but feels unchallenged? Check.Beautiful, sexy BFF who gets into dicey situations? Check.Satiric depictions of suburban mommies? Check.Obsession with a local murder that provides a diversion in a humdrum life?Check.Distant husband who denigrates his wife and orders her not to get involved? Check.Add in that the book is much less well written, the ending is rushed and implausible and you keep wishing that Kate would stop whining about how bored she was and get a part-time job or volunteer. At least Isaac's lead character made peace with her domestic life and planned to finish her doctorate."
2,a disappointment,"I loved Jennifer Weiner's books Good in Bed and Little Earthquakes, so I couldn't wait to open this book. The first chapter didn't get my attention, but I trudged on, waiting for it to get entertaining...on the last page I was still waiting. I wouldn't even have finished the book had it been written by someone else, but I wanted to give it a fair chance. I might be biased because I have never been a big fan of murder mysteries, which is what this book turns out to be. I highly suggest you pass on this one if you're looking for some good chick lit, because this belongs more in a category with Dean Koontz."
3,"Love Jennifer Weiner, but this was not her best...","I was so excited when I found out that JW came out with a new book and snatched it up right away. I LOVED her first three (Gook in Bed, In Her Shoes, best of all Little Earthquakes), so I was disappointed when Goodnight Nobody fell short of my expectations. The story-line didn't keep my interest, the characters weren't well-developed, and it seemed like JW was out of her element with this one. I won't give up on her though, 3 out of 4 is still pretty good to me!"
3,Might wanna skip this one,"I finished this book, cuz i just had to know ""who did it"" Like someone else commented; this book feels like an epsiode out of Desperate Housewives lol I mean who has time to go gossip and try to figure out who killed the neighbor? Never mind the fact that its a neighbor u dont know?! Weird. But heyy it kept me entertained, and made me laugh, not one of Weiner's best, but it was ok, and I'll still run out to get her next book."
4,Weiner tries something new,"Weiner's typical formula of overweight woman unhappy with some part of her life has worked for three books. In _Goodnight Nobody_, she sticks with this formula, but also tries something new. It is a mystery of sorts.The perfect mother is found dead. Her death was not a natural one. So, the community of Upchurch, CT (a whole community of perfect mothers) seeks to protect their families while honoring the deceased.Kate Klein is not a perfect mother. As the discoverer of the dead body, she feels a connection with the woman who has died and seeks to discover who was responsible for the death.If this is your first Jennifer Weiner book, you will love it. If you have read several of her books, you will enjoy it, but realize it is not her best book. It's enjoyable for sure, but she has written better stories!"
2,Eh.,"I'm still not sure what to think of this book. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good. I wish it would have focused more on Kate--what a great character. I could have done without the flashbacks while growing up, because it really didn't serve much purpose since the story wsn't really focused on Kate. Just left me feeling wierd."
3,The ending pissed me off,This was a solid book. Not great but not bad. I would say it's worth reading on a rainy day. I give it 3 stars for 2 reasons. 1) the first 75 pages bored me to tears and 2) the underlying love story was never concluded.
2,Lot to be desired,"I am a huge Jennifer Weiner fan, but this one left me a bit disppointed. I found the ""crime-solving"" Kate to be unbelievable. I understand wanting to find out who the killer is in a small town, but she went to great lengths to uncover the truth. It just all seemed too far-fetched for me. Thankfully, Kate had her friend Janie to get us through. Stick to Chick Lit, Jennifer, and leave the crime solving/mysteries to someone else."
4,3 1/2 Stars,"Maybe it's because I was brain dead from a ""Shopoholic"" book I finished before I picked this one up, but I kind of liked it. I've read all Ms. Weiner's books, and have liked all of them much more than other ""lite"" reads. I find I can usually relate to the main characters in some way and enjoy the stories around them. What I don't like is when there are elements that are so over the top that they take you out of the story and make you think ""that was so stupid"" or ""oh please that would never happen."" I get that it's fiction and everything but there was just too much in this one for me to love it."
3,Not as good as past books.,"Kate Klein has gone from writing about New York night life to living in UpChurch,home of the supermommies. When Kate finds Kitty dead in kitchen, Kate starts to investigate. With her best friend Janie, Kate finds herself trying to get her kids from nursery school and catch a killer who may be tageting other supermommies.""Goodnight Nobody"" is the fouth book by Jennifer Weiner a writer who first started reading because her great female characters who were mainly plus size. But I have to say these book was not her best. Ms. Weiner seems to following other writers in doing suspense novels. I am not a great fan of the suspense novel, so this was not a favorite book."
4,Different for Weiner,"If you are buying this book because you want straight Chick Lit...don't. I was a little confused when I started to read mainly because I had no idea this was going to be a mystery. However, if you enjoy reading books like Evanovich's Plume series this one is worth the read. While it doesn't tie you in like Evanovich and make you want to find out the answer it is a decent book. It's got a little romance, a little mystery, a witty best friend.I have a 1 year old and find it necessary to read books I can pick up, read 2 or 3 pages, put down and come back to a day, a week, or two weeks later. This was it.Good for the beach or a snowy day. I recommend mass media paperback or paperback. Buy it used like I did."
4,Good entertainment not literature if that is what your looking for...,"Meant to give this three stars since it was just an okay read. I haven't completed a book in a while so actually completing one was worth some congratulations. This book irritated me at times when I found typos, when one thought to the next was hard to follow and when the story was overall completely unbelievable. The ending was a bit disappointing and the characters were underdeveloped. I still found myself interested just enough to finish the book. If you are looking for escapism or just a simple enjoyable read without having to bang your head against a wall while writing a thesis this is an enjoyable book."
1,Waste of time,"I know that as a woman ""of a certain age"" I am not in the demographic group the publisher and author were aiming this book at, but I took a chance and sad to say was disappointed that I wasted the time. Some amusing lines but overall the characters were no one I was interested in or cared about. Wasn't even sorry for the woman who was stabbed to death in her kitchen. How bad is that? Do I sense a sequel here: Evan and Kate bonding together at last to solve life's petty mysteries when they're not stealing precious moments for torrid sex before the kids come back from preschool?"
3,Not bad...,"I've read all of Jennifer Weiner's books. This one wasn't the best, but it wasn't horrible either. I enjoyed the mystery aspect, but toward the end the story began to lose steam. The Kate-Evan storyline was the most compelling and I wanted her to dump her lame husband for him. Her relationship with Evan wasn't resolved and the book never really explained how their relationship ended years ago.I do love Jennifer Weiner's writing but this one felt a little unfinished, like it needed more tweaking. I agree with other reviewers that there were too many characters to keep track of. Despite all that, I don't regret buying the book and i look forward to her other novels."
2,funny at first - slow in the middle - and just dragged in the end,"Kate Klein got me from the getgo with her humor and zaney mommy-life. I am always on the hunt for mommmy-lit but this book fell short for me. The story played out instantly in my head as an episode on Desperate Housewives. I love that show but rather not have it in a book format. Kate goes to her friend, not so close if at all! friend's house and finds her dead. A who-dunnit ensues but not without playground banter and perfect mommy bashing (which was hilarious) but it was still grasping. I think Weiner would do better to leave mystery out of her novels."
2,A Little Disappointed,I was a little disappointed with this book. Jennifer Weiner is one of my favorite authors but it was hard for me to get past the liberal bias and conservative critisim in this book. Had she left the politics out of the book I would have given it 4 or possibly even 5 stars. I hope in the future she does not incorporate politics into her books....I enjoy reading them but that was a big turn off for me.
3,Engaging writing style keeps this from being rated a 2,"Jennifer Weiner has an appealing style of writing, in fact, she's just plain funny. Her previous books have been delightful. This book, an attempt at mystery, deviates from her winning m.o. Although I did laugh out loud a few times, I didn't care about the characters as I wanted. She started with a pretty good setup, but the author didn't achieve the necessary character development. The ending had the characters change too radically (Reina, for example) and stretched believability. The last two pages of the book are ridiculous, and cheapen the pages before it. Jennifer Weiner has misfired on this book, but on the strength of her others, I'll look forward to her next."
4,"Entertaining, but not as satisfying as her other novels","This book was funny and kept me reading, but as another reader noted, it felt unfinished. The backstory regarding Evan needed more attention in order to justify her current struggle over him. The history regarding the actual killer was scant, making the ending less plausible. I also felt the reader did not get adequate closure regarding her personal life (but I need a lot of closure).The best thing about Weiner is that despite all that, this was a hard book to put down. Her sense of humor is priceless and her take on motherhood is sooooo true. I enjoyed all four of her novels."
2,Pass on this Weiner book...,"Let me start by saying that I'm generally a fan of Jennifer Weiner books. I loved Good in Bed & In Her Shoes. So it is with much disappointment that I have to say I didn't care for this one at all.The plot was disjointed - particularly at the end. Did she leave her husband or decide to work it out? No idea. The character development wasn't the greatest & I had trouble keeping track of some of the names. So when you come to the murderess, I was racking my brain trying to figure out who that was. I just felt like this book was rushed together without as much thought and care as some of her other books.I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,The Worst Ending Ever!,"Goodnight Nobody is the first novel that I've read by Jennifer Weiner, and most likely will be the last. It was somewhat entertaining but the ending was so bad that I regreted wasting my time reading it. I was thinking of several different endings that would have been more intriging."
3,Departure from the Norm,"I loved all of Jennifer Weiner's previous books, so I eagerly bought this one up. While I enjoyed her usual writing style, the story is not her regular ""chick-lit"" genre. This book is diving into a murder mystery, so anyone looking for Jennifer Weiner's usual type of story may want to steer clear of this one. While I still liked it and the writing is as good as all of her previous books, it lacks some of the spark that the first three books had and the characters just didn't grab me or stay with me the way her others had. Anyone who is a fan of her writing itself may enjoy it."
1,No Susan Isaacs,Goodnight Nobodoy is a pathetic rip off of Susan Isaacs. Save your money! Get Susan Isaacs books if you want the real thing!
2,Usually devour ...,"I usually can't put down a book by Jennifer Weiner. This one I struggled with, I'd do laundry before I'd read it! I wasn't able to finish it with my first try but I'll probably give it another shot."
1,Awful plot,"I loved loved ""Good in bed"" and it was such a disappointment to read this book and wonder if I've wasted several hours of my life. Read it like a short story, with clever paragraphs. As a book, the plot is awful."
2,Not so great,"I didn't like the ending. It felt like a switch and bait to me. It was all wrapped up in a too unbelievably neat package. What bothered me the most though was how the tone of the book seemed to change. It seemed so fun, tongue-in-cheek, spoof on the perfect suburban moms in the beginning and was then waxing all philosophical and serious at the end. Loved ""Good in Bed"" btw! Haven't tried her others...am now not so sure."
