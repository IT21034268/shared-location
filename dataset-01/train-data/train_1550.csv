5,Absolutely Stunning,"I loved this book from cover to cover. I'm a student which not much time for free book reading but by the second this was handed to me, all schoolwork was pushed from my head (ok, so not the best thing to happen but it shows my love of this book). Passing it on to my girlfriends and I loved it."
2,Hard Subject To Read,"If you are a parent and don't care for the recent slew of books about the death of a child..DON'T DO IT!! I picked up this book after many recommendations, and I was disappointed. The story was manipulative and heart-rending to any parent who's worst fear is the death of their children. It definately did not live up to the hype I have heard about this author."
1,Disjointed writing,"Reading through the reviews here I see nothing about Ms. Picoult's method of writing. I found it to be choppy, disjointed, and confusing at times. For example, each chapter's title is a character's name which we're supposed to know that he/she is talking (1st person)to us. I constantly had to refer to the chapter beginning to remind myself who was talking. Going back and forth from the past to present also was a bit confusing. Naming a dog ""Judge"" while dealing with a judge in the book was a bit much. This book did not have a nice flow to it which spoiled the enjoyment of reading. The subject matter was interesting but the ending was like it was written by a novice beginner writer. I've heard Picoult is a great writer but obviously not my type or style."
4,"Enthralling, but a strange ending.",This novel was really a page turner. It was fairly well written and concise. The only thing I really had a problem with was the ending. It was a strange way to end such a long book. I guess I was expecting something different.
5,What a book....,"Having never read any of Jodi Picoult's books before, I decided to give this one a try and I'm very happy that I did. It grabbed me from the first page til the very end. I understood the anguish of Anna, Kate and their parents. The ending was something I was prepared for but not the person I expected. After this book, I will read more of Jodi Picoult's books, She has intrigued me.... to a level that I can not explain."
4,My Heart Ached,"My Sister's Keeper is written so carefully and so vividly. I was there in person with every word and sentence I was pulled further and further. I can't imagine going through such a hurtful experience. But, it's definitely a must read. I wholeheartedly recommend it. Have your tissue box ready."
1,Wanted it to be better,"This was one of the worst written books I've read. The character development was poor, the writing was choppy, and the narrator changed at whim.. I kept having to double back to figure out who was talking. I kept reading, hoping it was just a slow start. Wrong. The book gets worse as it goes along. The plot is unrealistic. Who would ever let a 13 year old girl sleep at the firehouse and go to the fire scene? How do the lawyer I understand the mother's need to fight for her daughter's life, but could she be that uncaring about her other daughter until the end of the trial? I found myself skimming pages to get through it. The ending - well, it was so far gone for me at that point it didn't matter, but there are enough reviews about what a poor choice that was. The changing text size is annoying. This is the last Jodi Picoult novel for me. I don't know why it was so popular. Maybe people were hoping it would be better based on her previous work."
4,"Better than I thought it would be,","but that's not saying much.I knew there would be a ""twist"" to the end of this book because of a bonehead reviewer who mentioned that something would happen at the end, but I didn't know exactly what it would be. Unlike another reviewer, the very last part of the book earned my review another star.This is the fourth or fifth Picoult book I have read so I knew that there would be different point of views (and fonts), emotional crises, and an After-School Special Disease-of-the-Week. There would be a big trial towards the end, and many characters would be lawyers.Campbell's service dog's function was teased through the book, as I knew it would be. I enjoyed the ""reveal"" when it finally happened.What brought this all together is the skill with which Picoult fleshes out her outline. I will be reading more of her books soon."
4,My Sister's Keeper,"Everyone has told me that I should read Jodi Picoult, and this was the first book of hers that I read. Going into it, I thought that it would be a teen book, but found it extremely well-written and very thought provoking. I ended up reading it in one day because I couldn't wait to see what happened! I have to admit that it was a bit of a tear-jerker!"
1,Controversy mistaken for depth,"The only thing that makes this book even appear to be worthwhile is it's ""controversial topic"" (which is advertised right on the cover). I was so irritated with how awful this book was it took me over an hour to chill my brain enough to start a new one. So often controversy is mistaken for depth. This book had none. I thought it was going to be great but the more I read the more I was proved wrong. The characters are absurdly one-dimensional while constantly try to claim otherwise through out the book but ultimately don't. This book is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Normally if I don't like a book I donate to the thrift store or give it BCID on bookcrossing. This one I tossed directly into the recycling."
3,"bad ending, unrealistic,couldn't put it down","If there are two things I hate in a novel they are :1: having a love story added to a book when it in not needed and detracts from the otherwise interesting plot and 2: adding a twist to the end of a story that deflates the emotional intensity that has built up, making the book unrealistic. This book has both. Other than that it is well written and a real page turner ,but, be prepared to suspend disbelief through out."
4,This was a Great Book,"This is normally not my kind of book. I tend to like fast moving mysteries (Patterson, Grishim). But I purchased it based on the recommendation of my book store owner. I expressed my enjoyment over ""A Million Pieces"" and ""My Friend Leonard"" (before all the bad hype) and she said to try this. Being the mother of 2, it became a very gripping read for me personally. Yes, the ending is a bit of a *gasp - NO* type of feeling, but isn't that what makes a great book? regardless of the ending, it's an emotional roller coaster of a fast read."
4,Great Book,"This book was wonderful. Lots of twists in the plot, and a great ending. I read this for bookclub, and it was a great discussion. Very thought provoking."
5,The greatest book,"This is the greatest book that I have ever read. 400 pages in less than two days, I simply could not put it down and was devastated when it was over."
2,capitalizing on important human social dilemma,"This book capitalizes on a socially important subject without contributing any intrinsic value. Witness: the product placements, ineffective use of ""in their voice"" due to inadequate character development, and the cheap-shot ending. The intention appears to me as simple mental manipulation of the masses to equate the importance of this book with the importance of the singular question on which the story is based. Tabloid-style sensationalism always finds a popular audience; selfish capitalism prevails over social responsibility in the short term. However, if a genuine, constructive exchange of ideas regarding this human social dilemma is generated as a result of this book then perhaps it is worth the paper on which it is printed after all."
2,alright..,"The book was not in the best condition, the spine was bent many times and the cover and inside was worn."
5,I haven't read it yet! (updated to I have read it),But reading these reviews has me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the PostMan to deliver it! I saw the previews of the movie that is out this Summer and it made me cry twice! The Previews! Everyone says the books are always 3 times better!Updated Review.It was worth the wait. I got the book on Tuesday Night and had finished it by Wednesday Night. I couldn't put it down and I cried more than I think I've cried in years.
4,Ruined my day,"I'm very angry with Jodi Picoult. She was in complete control of the lives of the characters of this book. I have to wonder why she chose to end this book the way she did. I have to give the book high ratings due to the skill of the author. All along, I was tempted to peek at the ending, which I've been guilty of a time or two. This time, for some unknown reason, I resisted. I wish I had peeked now, because it would have saved me a few sleepless nights trying to finish the book.I'll say this, for the author, she knows how to hold my attention. There were a lot of thought-provoking topics covered. I like the way we can get inside of the minds of all of the main characters. So much so, that I almost felt their pain.For the sake of you who have purchased or plan on purchasing this book, don't peek at the end. You may not want to finish the book if you do."
1,SPOILER - Weak ending!!!,"I was entangled in Ms. Picoult's writing from page one. I truly loved her style and thought I had found a new favorite, but the ending was a stretch to say the least. SOOOOOOOO disappointing!"
2,Five Star book until the end!,I agree with the other readers. The book is GREAT until the last few chapters as we watch Anna struggle to find her purpose in the world. Her purpose other than just saving her sister Kate. But then....the author gives us an unsatisfying ending that's a total disappointment. It's a copout and outrageous. And the end totally erases every step every single character took on their journey to the end of the book. Boo!
3,Good Book for Bookclub Discussion,"If you are looking for a book that will lead to heated discussions about moral and ethical decisions, this is a good book to read for a bookclub. Each character is allowed the chance to be the 'voice' for a chapter, which allows for a deeper connection to be made with each character, instead of receiving only one character's opinion. I read this book in one day, and cried at the ending. Another reader said that the ending ruined her opinion of Picoult and that she wouldn't read another Picoult book ever. To readers who love happy endings and 'happy ever after', read this book anyway. It was nice to read a book that ended with life and reality in mind, in stead of pleasing the reader. I have chosen to give this book 3 stars (even though I really enjoyed it) because I have read better (and worse) books. Picoult is a good writer, and I plan on picking up some more of her works at the library today."
2,Couldn't wait for it to end!,"The only reason I give it more than one star is that the premise upon which the story was based was an interesting one. But that's where my appreciation ends. Aside from being about 200 pages too long, the most disturbing fact was that all of the character's voices sounded exactly the same. I continually had to go back to the start of the chapter to figure out who was talking b/c the mother sounded like Anna who sounded like the Dad who...you get the point. I also found myself getting annoyed because no matter how bright they may be, 13 year olds aren't nearly as insightful and philosphical as Anna was. And to be quite honest, neither are most adults! And that lack of authenticity made the entire story implausible. I was more irritated than moved by the subplot about the brother that ended up going nowhere and the ending.... come ON!If My Sister's Keeper is an accurate representation of Picoult's work, I think I've had my fill."
1,"Wait, what? Kindle $2.11 *more* than paperback?",You have got to be kidding me. I don't think so; not going to happen. Publishers need to get in touch with reality and price accordingly.
2,Poor Resolution,"I was immensely disappointed by the ending of the book. The start of the book was good ;I was forced to consider this novel situation of a child created to fuel the life of a sick older sibling. The ending however was a mess, like a D rated movie, sloppy and not creative in the least.The author could have made more of an effort with the resolution."
4,Unresolved Issues,"I read My Sister's Keeper for the first time as a part of the 2012 World Book Night. Picoult is a captivating and suspenseful writer. She creates unpredictable drama filled with momentum and insight. The entire book switches first person voices between each of the characters. This is somewhat unsettling as she develops them to an interesting point and then switches to another character. After a while, the reader acclimates to this style. Throughout the book the writer builds complexity and emotion, but then lets readers down with a convenient ending which mechanically resolves the issues and at the same time leaves them entirely unresolved. The ending does not match the complexity of the rest of the book. Apart from this, the book is well-written and an excellent read."
4,Deep issues in an interesting novel,"Jodi Picoult did a great job in tieing together very deep issues while keeping the reader interested. It is a book that many people especially ones with siblings can relate too. There are two sisters in this novel Kate and Anna. Kate is the oldest and is diagnosed with leukemia, so her parents decide to have another baby, Anna who hopefully will have the same blood type as Kate. Throughout Anna's short life she is needed to keep Kate alive on multiple occasions. Kate now needs a kidney to survive and Anna decides enough is enough and decides to get a lawyer to help her protect her body from her parents.Some deep issues are formed in this novel. Anna has basically been given life just to keep her sister, Kate alive, so is she now obligated to continue saving her? Is Anna seen as a bad person for not saving her sister? Picoult does a fantastic job in creating a serious family feud within Anna's family. This is an awesome book and definately worth reading."
5,Amazing,"This book is amazing.... The author captivates the readers attention in so many ways.... With this book expect the unexpected...its so thrilling that you can't put the book down... with this book you get it all drama, romance, mystery, ect... As a mother I was able to brainstorm and put myself in an uncomfortable position but that is what real life is all about...."
4,Only one flaw,"On the whole this was a fantastic read, the moral dilemmas raised are explored in a thought provoking and sensitive manner from several points of views. The narrative is light enough to to keep the story flowing but strong enough to present emotions that are heart wrenching at times. The fact that the book really makes the reader question their own thoughts and beliefs made this a deeply engaging read. The ending does not provide a resolution but i prefer it that way so for me there is only one flaw and it is the romance that takes place between two of the main characters; in my opinion it was stereotypical, unnecessary and at times annoyingly caused distraction from the powerful central theme. As long as you can get past the corny romance this is an extremely worthy read."
5,My Sister's Keeper is an A+!,MY Sister's Keeper has to be just about the best book I have ever read! It was inspiring and thoughtful. Jodi Picoult is obviously a seasoned writer that knows what she's doing. I can't wait to read more of her incredible work. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Grab some tissues and start reading... you'll be up all night!
3,Tough choices,"I wouldn't call Picoult a great writer but the book kept my interest and was a fast read. I read it because my two teen-aged daughters did and they loved it. The question of whether is is moral and fair to have a child for the sole purpose of saving another is surely a topic worthy of exploring and this book might open up that topic for a book group. The book seemed a little too simple to me (such as the predictable character of the older brother, Jesse)and it did not develop the character of Kate (the ill child) very well. The relationship between the attorney, Campbell, and the guardian ad litem, Julia, seemed forced, predictable and trite. There were two surprises in the end. The mother was the most tragic figure of all; even the ultimate solution would surely haunt her the rest of her days."
4,Beauitfully written - movie has different ending!,"I read the book before seeing the movie and was struck with Picoult's telling of the story through the eyes of different characters. Each one gets enough ""space"" to be truly developed and you see the conflict and pain in this family from the inside out.I saw the movie after reading the book and was surprised that the end of the movie is the exact opposite of the ending of the book. I teach ethics and the combination makes for great classroom discussion.I highly recommend reading the book first, but even if you've already seen the movie, it's a good read!"
5,Truly Amazing...,"This was the first Picoult novel I've read... and it was amazing. The characters are completely believable in their actions, and each chapter's first person narrative with all the different characters lets the reader really ""feel"" the character's emotions and motives. The tragic, surprise ending really makes this book a tearjerker. Throughout the story though, Jodi takes you on a roller-coaster ride and doesn't let go. Her ability to weave in controversial issues without over-kill is remarkable. I cannot recomend this book highly enough. My Sister's Keeper is a breath-taking read, and a book I will definately re-read soon!"
1,What a waste of my time!,"I suffered through this book because I liked the character of Anna. The author spends far too much time evaluating the personal lives and back-stories of marginal characters. It was the ending of the book, however, that destroyed the novel. It was surreal. It was cliche. It was a cheap shot. The author claims there was no other way to realistically end this novel. Really? What are the chances in real life of such a false turn of events. Shaking my head and wishing I hadn't wasted my time on this book. Sorry, Anna. The author went for melodrama instead of giving you the choices you fought for."
2,I've been had!,"Jodi, Jodi, Jodi. Why'd you have to play me that way? I fell in love with you characters, warts and all, because they felt so real. And then you ripped the rug out from under me with such a far-fetched, sensationalistic ending. I just wanted to scream. You don't need to do that. You're such a fantastic writer. What felt so real turned suddenly false. I wished you'd given this book the ending it deserved, then I would have added two more stars to this review."
2,So let down,"I really enjoyed the start of this book, the characters seemed complex, parents struggling with the heartbreak of a child slowly dying complicated by the moral dilemmas that genetic selection bring to medicine, but long before the end I felt like Jodi Picoult had stolen valuable hours of my life. The end is so ridiculous, i felt I was watching a cheap one hour TV show where all the loose ends have to be wrapped up in the last 10 minutes. The fact that someone would still be devastated about being dumped by their High School boyfriend 15 years after it happened began to seem normal compared to the drivel that followed - if only I could get a time refund."
5,Superb,"I am not an avid reader however a friend, who is, recommened this book. It was amazing. Jodi Picoult really knows how to tell a story and connect you with the characters. I was not able to put it down. I was so stunned by the last chapter I had to pick it up and read it again. I have recommended this book to all my friends and even some strangers, I surley recommend it to you."
4,A good novel that got a little side tracked,"I must begin by saying that I did thoroughly enjoy this book. I found the characters interesting and well written, and the premise of the story was very thought provoking. Anna, Kate, Jesse, and Brian Fitzgerald were all very real characters, and I enjoyed them. Sara Fitzgerald was a little harder to enjoy, but her part in the story made it necessary for her to come across a little harsher. Campbell and Julia were good, but I found the subplot with them irritating, and distracting. It was a pretty good subplot, if a little over used, but I felt like too much time was spent with them, and about them, and it reached a point where I started just skimming the chapters about them, skipping over their narratives in order to get back to the real story. The ending was shocking, and a tear-jerker, but I thought it was an excellent way to end the novel. Well worth the read, I would recommended it to anyone who enjoys a ""deeper"" book."
3,GREAT book... except for the ending.,"I wish I could give this book a rating of 5 stars. It was definately the type of book that you can't put down after you start to read it. If not for the ending, I would consider this book an EXCELLENT read!I'm writing this review to serve as a warning to those who are considering it: It has a very unexpected, frustrating and sad ending. I did NOT enjoy the ending. I don't understand why the author chose to go that route, and when I read her explanation of it, it didn't seem like much of an explanation.The ending ruined the book for me. It felt like the book lead you through so much just to dump you at the end with a huge feeling of emptiness."
2,"drawn out, dull and predictable","This author had high recommedations, now I am not sure if I will try any of her other books"
5,Jodi Picoult does it again!!!!!,"I absolutely could not put this book down. This a story so compelling, about the love between family and the dynamics involved.I have read everything this author has written. I loved Perfect Match and My Sisters Keeper is in that same realm of reading.Ms. Picoult can bring you right into the soul and heart of how an individual feels,you are drawn to these characters. As always, the ending holds a punch I didn't see coming.I highly recommend this book!!!"
2,Lacking something...,"This book was recommended to me by a number of people. It was a well-written and very compelling read. However, I thought the ending was completely false and was created with shock value in mind. I didn't expect a happy ending, but a realistic one. I was disappointed with this book. I just finished The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters by Elisabeth Robinson. It deals with similar themes and it just felt so much more true to me. Buy that one instead."
3,Jodi Picoult still hasn't won me over,"I'm not a Jodi Picoult fan - I've read a handful of her books and I generally find the characters and dialogue seem flat and unrealistic. I am also wary of an author who tries to tackel a ""difficult issue"" with every bestselling novel, and I read with the expectation of emotional manipulation. My Sister's Keeper is interesting enough that I could read from beginning to end (and the end felt like an unexpected, and unnecessary, shock), and it made me think, as I suppose I was supposed to. It's a good airplane book, but that's about it."
2,"Interesting and Timely Premise Flattened by Metaphor, Coincidence and Irony","I was willing to finish this book, but I hurried through the second half because I wanted it to be over, not because I couldn't wait to see how it ended. The book is a lot longer than it should be because the author is constantly kicking the reader in the face with metaphors. And the ironical ending was really too much. The characters are flat in spite of all their introspection, and things work out so patly at the end that it's ridiculous (one character, a felonious arsonist with a drug and alcohol problem who steals construction equipment in his spare time, becomes a police officer!). The mother is incredibly difficult to like considering her very legitimate grief. And a romance subplot between attorneys works out in spite of the guy being a huge jerk because his lady-love finds out that he, of all things, suffers from a disability. Though well-written to some degree, I simply can't recommend this book."
3,"controversial topic, complex issues in a good story, but ...","A baby is genetically planned and created so she (and parts of her body, from blood to bone marrow to kidney) can be used to save her sister with Keukemia.After a few pages, I was hooked and could not put it down. Jodi Picolt has taken a very difficult topic. You couldn't help but struggle with the family. What is right and what is wrong? What is moral?Although the story is pretty good, the book is also disappointing in a few aspects. Firstly, the six different narrators have almost the same voice. The way they talk is not much different. Secondly, although there is some interesting twist towards the end of the book, the ending is too neat and easy and a bit of a cliche, making it more or less predicable.Overall, I am still recommending it as it provocks one's thoughts on controversial issues we are facing in this modern society.Lucy Chen"
4,Very good read,I normally read nonfiction buy this was a gift so I gave it a read. I couldn't put the book down. The story was well written. I could see this happening (in fact have seen the basic part of the story just not the lawsuit). It pulls at the heartstrings and makes you think what you would do if EVER in such a situation. It did jump around a bit but that didn't matter to the story.
3,"Thought-provoking, but not great","I just read the entire book in one sitting, which I suppose is measure of a book being at least entertaining, if not necessarily *good.* My opinion pretty much echoes that of LA Mama's - the love story was forced and unnecessary, as was Jesse's plot line. The ending was so cliched it could have been a Hallmark movie. As someone in the medical field, I appreciate that Picoult seems to have researched the subject thoroughly, but I found myself distracted by little errors. For instance, 82 stitches to sew a laceration 1.5 inches long?? It wouldn't take 82 stitches to sew up an entire abdomen."
4,hooked by chapter one; tear jerker in the end but worthy of a read,The emotions and events of this book seemed mostly believable. I found myself sobbing on more than one occasion. Terminal illness and loss are given realistic but hopeful treatment. I identified with many of the characters and at the end wanted to send it to my brother because of a special loss we have shared.
2,if you want a good Piccoult book choose Salem Falls or Vanishing Acts,"My Sister's Keeper was a let down for me. I am typically a fan of Piccoult's work which has the tendency to push the bar on plausibility and does often lean to the over dramatic side but usually the plot and her writing strengths such as settings and characterization keep a balance in her work, this novel just got ridiculous. The ending was silly. This book attempted to take on too many issues at once had this merely involved the two sisters it would have been enough but throwing in the issues of the lawyers, the mother, the father and practically the son's problems gave this book the feeling of everything but the kitchen sink, if you want a good Piccoult book choose Salem Falls or Vanishing Acts both of which are well done and are real page turners."
3,Not happily ever after.,I totally loved this book until the end. The end ruined the entire book for me.
1,I am Late to the Party here ...,"At the end of the day, this book is bad. And the primary reason, the totally illogic ending.For the first 300Plus pages, I was totally engrossed. The author proposed quite a dilemma. And something we should talk about. My thought, throughout the book was how much $$$$ is being spent maintaining this one person's life? Kate. At one point, the book goes into it, it is $100,000. But that is not, right. Clearly, it is in the $Millions. Yet the author never addresses, that. Instead, she goes off on this totally maudlin ending that defies reality. It was like she was trying to write a ""movie ending,"" but in the end, the movie ending, that was finally made from this book was the right ending.Do not buy this book. You will just waste the 20 hours I wasted, reading it. See the movie. It is WAY better.I am giving the book to the GoodWill."
2,Good Story Bad Ending,Love the idea of how Medicine and young girl come to terms with each other. Love the fact a family and its dynamics were put to the test. Cheesy end.
4,A Novel Worth Reading,"I really enjoyed this book. It was chosen as the book our entire county should read this year. It was not only an interesting story which involved ethical questions, but there were surprising situations that appeared throughout the novel, especially at the end.I do question about younger people reading this because of some of the content."
5,A MUST READ,"I purchased this book based on a recommendation from a friend, who is a cancer survivor. From page one I couldn't put it down. It made me laugh and cry. Keep a box of tissues close."
2,Don't read the last ten pages,This was a well written and thoughtful book dealing with a serious and real issue in today's world of scientific manipulation of human lives. However the last ten pages made me really angry. Seriously I was yelling at this book after reading the last ten pages. She Really needed a better editor.
5,wow,"I have never read any of Jodi Picoult's book. I had picked this one because of the subject matter. Thought this would be a great spring board for discussion for our book club. There is so much to talk about I don't know where to begin. The characters, the family, the illness, the mother and how she deals with her daughter who has Cancer and the daughter who will she thinks saves her.But the sister, has cancer tells her if she wants it to stop is to have herself medically emancipated thus starts the story. And a lot more to delve into. The end is a tear jerker. What hit me the most is that no one made the decision if you believe in g-d, he did. If you believe in fate that had something to do with it. But it left you in tears for quite awhile. I had a friend who nephew died a couple hours after I read the book so I was still raw from the book. What even made the book more interesting. Each chapter had different type in the pages of the different characters."
3,A book of morals that should have ended simpler,"Jodi Picoult wrote a novel dealing with an issue that is very topical today. The idea of the plot itself was very good and had an opportunity to be great. However, I did not think it was well executed. One thing that threw me off especially was the idea to have multiple narrators including just about all the main characters. This seemed gimmicky to me and left me wanting to hear from different people when she had another character narrating. Most of the characters developed well throughout the story and seemed consistent with the exception of Sara. Jodi Picoult used her as the villain in her story when I think she should have made people sympathetic to her situation. All in all I was drawn into the story and very surprised at the ending, though some of the end could have been left to the readers imagination."
5,A wonderful read,"This was a really wonderful, poignant novel. Jodi did a great job of helping you to see the story from each character's perspective. This made it twice as hard to decide which viewpoint to side with, much less to then stick with that decision once you'd made it. It really made you think about life and how you'd react if you were in Anna's place."
2,After hearing so much about this author...ugh,"I have heard so much about this author from friends, fellow teachers, my mother, etc. This is the first one of her novels I have read. I was hooked by page 2. Thought this is amazing. What a crazy idea, different format, can't wait to read more. Then things went goofy. Mom was talking in the past, now she's present tense, weird sub-plot of the attorney and his dog, does the brother have to be a pyro?! It was all too much and became cliche and predictable down to the ridiculous ending. A book made for Lifetime. It was just plain stupid. I hesitate to read any others by her."
4,"Review of ""My Sister's Keeper""","I enjoyed reading the novel, ""My Sister's Keeper"" by Jodi Picoult. The book was very engaging and the author did a nice job of developing all of the characters. The only dislike about the book was that the point of view jumped around a lot between different characters & even different time periods, which made it slightly difficult to follow at times (although it was interesting to listen to the various characters points of view as well). Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to others."
4,My Sister's Keeper,Excellent book with very factual date regarding stem cell tx and treatment of lekuemia. What an ending. I still shiver.
2,In the end...not worth the read.,"I am someone who rarely has the time to just sit down and read. I really wanted to read this book before seeing the movie. I wish I had just seen the movie and didn't bother with the book. I agree with some of the reviewers that it was overly contrived and melodramic. Each chapter was told from a different characters point of view. I would find myself putting the book down when certain characters were telling the story. I really didn't care what they were thinking. I too hated the ending. It was such a cop out by the author.As I read this, I kept thinking of the story The Sound and the Fury which I read in highschool. It was told in a similar fashion but features realistic tragic characters."
1,Cheesy and corny.,"My sister in law told me how this book made her cry and she could not stop reading it. So, out of curiosity, I purchased it and anticipated tears streaming down my cheeks.Here I am, 350 pages, I have not got one single tear, nor have I felt the emotion to cry. ALL I got is anger.The author tried wayyyyyy too hard to write those cheesy, sappy lines. The 13 year old Anna thinks like a 53, who has been through everything in life. Brian and Sara are the same. Almost everyone in this book thinks so philosophically that I can not stop rolling my eyes.There is really nothing good about this book. Don't waste your time."
4,A Quickly Engrossing Story,"This story sucked me in immediately and held me to the end. It's an interesting premise and a very well-written portrayal. I don't particularly like the ending, but others might. The twist in the last few pages is the only reason I can't give this book 5 stars, but I still highly recommend this book as a thought-proviking and entertaining read."
5,sooooooo sad!,"This book really makes you think. It shows all sides of the story and not just Kate's. I thought that it was more than the disease that tore them apart. It was the actions they made around it. Warning: hysterical crying at the end is normal, at least for me"
4,A Moral Struggle in a Tight Knit Family,"I will not review the plot line of ""My Sister's Keeper"" since I believe it is very familiar and covered thoroughly in other reviews on this website. What I will say is that this is one of a handful of Jodi Picoult books that I have read, and I believe this one is the most powerful. Everything in this book feels genuine, from the competition between the siblings to the struggle between the parents to determine what is best for their children. The emotions in this book run deep and raw, and I think it would be hard to make it through to the end with a dry eye. Although I sometimes don't like how Picoult novels use ""worst case"" scenarios in storytelling, I felt like this novel was very effective in the way it used the illness of one girl to disect family issues, social issues, and moral issues of the country as a whole. I found this book fascinating, and I think it has convinced me to try other Picoult works."
4,Heart Wrenching...,Read this book before seeing the movie. I love the how the author writes each chapter from a different person's perspective - it really gives the story a complete feel. The book is amazing and the story heart breaking. I read it in 4 days.
4,Unexpected,Just finished reading this book and it was good. I didn't read it right away because I thought it would be sad. And it was a little but it was also very engrossing. Not at all girly so maybe I'll make my husband read it eventually.
4,A very good read,"I started reading this book because my boyfriend was starting college and this was required for incoming freshmen. I had no interest in reading this book because I had heard what it was about. I got bored one night and borrowed it from him, just to read the first few pages, and Holy cow! I was hooked! The ending was not what I expected, but it was really interesting to read and I really enjoyed it. It's a controversial topic, but you'll enjoy it."
4,Grab a box of tissues before you read!,"This is one of those books that pulls you in from the beginning. I read this book in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down. It is very sad at the end and tissues are highly recommended."
5,My Sister's Keeper - An astonishing book,"I loved reading this book! I actually cried tears. This book will really make you question your views on some pretty heavy topics and you may be surprised at your own reactions.Beyond that, the book is clever and written beautifully. I couldn't put it down."
2,Unrealistic Dialogue,"This is the first Jodi Picoult novel I've read, and I am not particularly impressed. I was looking forward to delving into this novel, but after a few chapters it became apparent that this is ""fast-food"" commercial fiction. It is a page-turner, but there is no depth to the characters. The main weakness of the book is that it is a dialogue-driven narrative, but the dialogue is poorly written. I was not at all convinced that the words and thoughts spoken by 13 year old Anna could possibly have come from a 13 year old girl. They sounded exactly like the words that a grown woman would put into the mouth of a 13 year old girl.The subject matter is interesting, and the plot is reasonably good, but the characters just don't ring true."
3,Be forewarned...,"I was not aware when I picked this book that the writing is probably around 7th-10th grade level. I found the use of different fonts to represent different characters fairly cheesy, especially since the same fonts were used for multiple characters, meaning you couldn't tell them apart without looking at the chapter head anyway. That said, I really enjoyed some of the more evocative metaphors, and I think I would have liked this book a lot more in 7th grade.I agree with pretty much every other reviewer about the ending. It is extremely harsh and anticlimactic, especially considering the book spends 400 pages slooowly building up to it."
1,I Thought It Was Completely and Totally Depressing,I'm in a mother/daughter bookclub (girls ages 15/16) and I wouldn't let my daughter read it. That is how strongly I feel. The only charaters that is worth mentioning is the lawyer and his dog and I'm still out on the verdict of the lawyers character.
1,Written with a bias...Pre-implantation genetic screening is not baby engineering!,"1 Star only because this book is well written. The plot is manipulated (to the point of being completely unrealistic) to make a case against pre-implantation genetic screening. If you know the story of the Denver-based family this book was inspired by, this book will upset you. Facts are twisted. This results in the spread of misinformation and is hurtful to those unfortunate enough to be in a similar situation. Genetic screening is not baby engineering. Why would someone want to turn something that was so helpful to a family into something so awful?"
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought the book because of this sudden hype about Picoult. Well, folks, I hate to tell you, it's another one of those incidents where the publisher decides to sell more books by a certain author and Picoult happens to be the flavor of the month. The book has an intriguing premise, and certainly deserves a more engaging way to tell the story - something which Picoult doesn't have."
1,Like a Lifetime Original Movie,"I read this book for my book club and was excited to try a new author. I plowed through it in a few sittings, but overall I was disappointed. The author uses different fonts for each character's narration, which comes across as gimmicky. Her writing style lacks fluidity, with recurring flashbacks that do not add much to the character development or plot. The story is predictable and the ending is a complete cop-out. This is not good literature, but more like a Lifetime Original Movie. (And over 400 pages of it!)"
1,"Interesting plot, terrible writing","Just read the first half, then skip to the epilogue. I actually kind of liked the ending, although I have to admit it was a bit contrived. The writing was filled with too many modern cultural references (infomercials, Spiderman movies), cliches, bad metaphors--and what was up with the different font for each voice? These writing techniques were just too gimmicky--they detracted from an otherwise fascinating subject."
2,Such a disappointment.,I cannot remember ever being so angry at an author for jerking me around as I was with Jodi Picoult when I got to the end of this book. I was willing to ignore the ridiculous coincidences (such as Julia and Campbell both working on this case--are there only a dozen people in this town?--and Jesse's crimes affecting both Brian and the judge) and overly affected writing because the plot was so engaging. But Picoult's idiotic and gratuitous surprise ending is unforgivable. I can't believe I wasted a day reading this book only to be jerked around at the end.
1,Why did I bother?,"About 100 pages into this really terrible, incredibly predictable, poorly written garbage I argued with myself about continuing. But I was on a plane and the flight had 3 more hours to go. From my seat, I couldn't see the movie screen, so I plodded on.I should have taken a long nap....you should too."
1,Painful to Read,"This was the worst book I have read in a long time. Between the changing of narrative voice to make up for its weak character development, the incredibly over-dramatized plot, the unbelievable plot twists, and above all, the idiotic (I'm sorry, there's no other word for it) ending, this book's greatest contribution to my life experience was to make me appreciate the beauty, complexity, and value of real literature."
5,My daughter loves it,We bought this book for my daughter for Christmas. She did not put it down after starting it. I love Jodi's books as well and plan to start reading it. I just have to get it away from my daughter first.
4,my sister's keeper,emotional book that kept me reading. it became heart-wrenching once picoult added her twist.
4,Read in two days...loved it,"From the perspective of a sister that just lost her brother in December, I think that this book is written extremely well. I found it hard to read at times because I was crying so much and to be honest, was probably not the best book to read so soon after my brother's death (to a five year battle with cancer- I'm 25, he was 27). However, the emotions in the book portrayed so much of what my family went through that it was almost spooky. Those who write that they do not understand the mother have obviously never been in this situation. My mom is the best mom that I know and yet, she had characteristics of Sara. I don't think anyone knows how they will react until the situation actually happens.I did find the ending very heartwrenching- almost to the extent that it was meant to do so, which I didn't like. But all in all, a very honest and engrossing book."
4,Keep with it,"Wasnt too sure about the book at the start, but kept with it and loved it.The ending is unbelievable........I cried."
4,My first Jodi Picoult book.....,"This was my very first time reading Jodi Picoult years ago. But have you ever gone to the movies and seen a great film but the ending was bad and it just made you mad! Well if that is how you feel, you may want to think twice before picking up some of Jodi Picoults books like this one! If you saw the movie ""My Sisters Keeper"" I will simply tell you that the ending of the film was different than the ending of this book so be prepared."
3,Good book...SUCKISH ending!!,"I began reading this book as part of an online book club. I have heard people go on and on about how good it is. Well it was pretty interesting for a while. What MOTHER in her right mind would have a child to pretty much donate to science for the welfare of her older child! No child should have to endure surgeries and testing like that. The book was pretty hard for me to get through but the only reason I finished it was to see the outcome of the trial...which was a no brainer. You know whats going to happen, its completely predictable. SPOILER ALERT...then to end the book with a fatal car crash..REALLY?!?! I was beyond mad that I read the whole book just for the main character to die at the end."
5,My Sisters Keeper,This is a book that will make you want to sit and finish at one sitting. Very thought provoking.
5,I'd give it 100 stars!!!,This is the BEST book I have ever read! I read The Lovely Bones 3 summers ago and I thought that was the best book I ever read and I hadn't found one I liked just as much....I think this book tops that one! :) The ending shocked me. I sooooo didn't see it coming.
3,okay,"but seriously, the ending was so predictable, and the writing was a bit juvenile and obvious. Sara's character was wayyyy too type-cast in this almost unbelivable parent who really felt bad about it, but really cared more about what happened to kate. the only decently written character was Izzy, as nothing predictable or too ""characterized"" came out of her mouth .. surprising, by the way the rest of the characters were written, i fully expected Izzy to be a man hating bull dykebut i have to disagree with one person on these reviews, the cover was the best part of the book"
4,Somewhere in the middle . . .,"I didn't like this book as much as some of the reviewers -- I didn't dislike it as much as others. I am somewhat bothered by a story being told my several of the characters; in this book, there were 7 people who spoke in first-person - that's 7 times over and over that the flow of the story was broken. I kept having to flip back and see who was ""talking"" and if I was in present day or the past. It also was a bit longer than necessary.I figured out one of the story's ""twists"" early on - that was a given.The ultimate ""twist"" - the end - didn't bother me as much as it did some - it almost had to have a bizarre ending. I kept wondering how Picoult would wrap all this heartbreak and sadness and decision-making into an acceptable ending - the answer was that she couldn't. There was no way this story could have had a happy ending."
3,good - but not great.,"My first foray into Picoult's prose and style, and i liked what i read; although the structure was pivotal around a shared narrative, (which resulted in jarring and slowing down movement of the novel), it was an effective tool in terms of controlling tension and producing strong characterization.Loved the subject matter - thoughtful, intense, real, and lent great insight into the world of bioethics and human rights - but i honestly felt cheated by the ending, much as others have noted in these reviews. Was Picoult lacking confidence here, and simply rushed an ending? not sure, but for all the strength she produced throughout earlier pages, the ending was weak and seemed anticlimactic in comparison, detracting from her earlier, more brilliant work. While i understand Picoult's motivations for choosing such an ending, i think she cheated the reader and diverted from the true meaning of the novel.good work, but not great."
5,Excellent!!,"There's only one word to describe this book. EXCELLENT! I had never heard of Jodi Picoult before three weeks ago when we walked into Barnes and Noble and 50 copies of this book stared me in the face. She has been elevated to my favorite author (I have since read her book 'Plain Truth').'My Sister's Keeper' is thought-provoking, and Ms. Picoult has a gift for weaving a scene in which you feel you are right there. I love the way she oscillates from first to third-person story telling and also the way she tells this story from every main charater's perspective. The end was so surprising. I sobbed. It was a little abrupt but still an unexpected twist. Thanks, Jodi, for a great read and for highlighting the struggle that many families face when dealing with a sick family member."
4,"Fascinating, emotional tale.","I have read most of Picoult's novels and mostly enjoyed them. The premise of this one - harvesting the various tissues and bodily fluids of one child for another - was irrestistible. I think she did a very good job with a difficult story, told by many different characters in different voices and viewpoints. However, the ending seemed contrived to me, so I could not rate the book 5 stars. And as other reviewers have said, have those hankies handy! I like her style, though, and I think it is a difficult thing to pull off a novel like this, so I do recommend this book highly. VERY hard to put down! Well worth your time, as are many of her other books."
2,"Great story, bad ending","I agree with the previous posters about the ending... which is a damned shame because I was looking forward to watching how this author would deal with the endgame of an interesting story. She really took the cowardly way out. I wish she had trusted her characters to finish up what they had started, but she didn't, and it's a shame. My disappointment will certainly prevent me from investing further time or money on any other of her books, at least for a while."
1,The ultimate letdown,"I almost quit reading-- I wish I had--when Dr Chance is on the stand and testifies that no hospital would force a child to donate an organ against her will, no matter what her parents want. Well then...what was the point of this book again?"
4,"So sad, not right","My god, I thought I had this book figured out.I didnt know the other would die.Now I want to see the movie, but i will most likely cry,if your a teen, you should read this."
2,Warning: not for men,"This novel purports to explore an issue of reliance on sibling donation to rescue a sibling from medical danger. In this case, it's a daughter conceived to be a donor to her older sister, suffering from leukemia. However, since the cast of characters never seems to have a conversation that lasts more than three exchanges before blowing up, nothing ever really gets explored. What we have is 400 pages of endless feelings - guilt, jealousy, anger, resentment, bitterness, anxiety, blah, blah, blah - capped by a prepostrously tacked-on twist at the end. If you want to read for empathy alone, this one's for you. If you're looking for a well-written, thoughtful, provocative novel, don't go here."
4,"Sad, but good","This is a well written novel that is quite thought provoking. A good, quick read, but it is definately sad. Definately recommend it, but be in the mood for a heart-tugging tale."
2,Puh-lease!!! Give me a break with the drama!,"I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion."
4,A touching and moving story,"I recommend this book to middle school students and older readers. THe story deals realistically with emotional isues; readers should be mature enough to understand these concepts. I liked the way the author moved the narration among six diferent characters, rather than telling the entire story from one point of view. I enjoyed reading the book because the story was touching and moving."
5,A Resonse to K.G. Haveman's earlier comment,"I am sorry, but the unpredictableness (is that a word?) of the ending of the story is what made this book the best. I bought this after so many great reviews by my peers, and found that I could not put it down till i finished it. The ending just made me want to read every other book she has written and will continue to write. The quality of writing and the eventful way she wrote this book kept me on my toes the whole time I was reading, always gasping at unexpected parts and watching relationships unfold. It was great how she also had side relationships that did not really have to do with the plot, but all came together in one way or another. I would recommend this book to anyone in the world, and I am looking forward to creating a vast collection with all of the books by this amazing author. GREAT JOB!!!"
4,Good Read,"This book is very good. It was originally recommended for my daughter's summer reading with the caveat that it might not be appropriate. Why the school would recommend something that they do not think is appropriate is another discussion. Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with it although it may be over the head of some of the students required to read it. They will read it as a good story. I believe it was recommended more as life lessons, family values, morals, and ethics. It does get a tad predictable but I have to admit that I never saw the end coming!"
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!,This was a wonderful book about a 13 year old girl who who wants to become an emancipated minor because she does not want to be a donor for her dying sister anymore. It gives you the perspective of all members of this family and the lawyers involved.
4,A worthy read,"I had been hearing people talk about this book for so long, I finally had to read it. It was a page turner, in most parts, and I can see why Jodi Picoult is so popular.The story and dilemma were heartbreaking, and overall I am certainly glad I read this. I can see why there is so much talk about it. The surprise ending (I thought) was wonderful. It added a lot of extra character. I added an extra star just for that.Three things, though, I didn't particularly care for: 1) overall I thought the whole book was just a bit overwritten 2) I didn't care two whits about the story line between Campbell and Julia and thought is was an annoying distraction, and 3) Picoult did not expand enough on the character of Jesse, in particular, Jesse and his parents. I don't mean to sound too critical, though, I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to most of the people I know."
3,"Page turner, but definitely has some flaws","The good parts:- premise is very interesting; it alone was enough to make me think.- Jodi Picoult writes well enough that it is a page turner.The bad parts:- so many points of view are unnecessary and, in my opinion, detract from the story. In particular, why have a POV for Campbell and Julia?- unessential romance between Campbell and Julia adds up to several wasted pages. It was an ok story for another book.- The ending. Dramatic endings have a time and place, but in my opinion, this was not it. In this case, it is the sign of a writer who just wanted to make a shocking impact instead of staying true to book's theme.- Inaccuracies. These I can forgive simply because this is a work of fiction. However, the credibility factor certainly goes away due to these inaccuracies (e.g. legal process, epilepsy, etc.)"
2,"cheesy, made-for-TV movie","First I'll say this is the first (and probably only) Jodi Picoult novel I've ever read. I'm not usually a fiction reader but this book was recommended to me after my daughter was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.While I think the storyline is a good one (and I don't even mind the ending) the writing is HORRIBLE. I can't even count the number of cheesy, obvious ""ironies"" and ""foreshadowing"". I'd say this book is about the level of reading for an 8th grader, if you took out the few ""f words"" and sexually suggestive ""scenes"".As for ""scenes"", that's my next point - this book was so OBVIOUSLY written to be turned into a Lifetime movie it isn't funny. Each chapter is from a different characters' first person point-of-view, and there is not much besides dialog and flashbacks.I feel like the time I spent reading this book was a waste - if someone had simply taken 5 to 10 minutes to tell me a detailed synopsis, I'd feel just as satisfied."
1,Insulting to the reader,"When we readers begin a book, we expect the author to put the main character in at least one difficult situation and work her way out. The ending of this book is a cop-out. Picoult took the easy way out and lost some readers' respect and readership. That was the last book of hers I ever read. The term for this not-respected plot device Is ""deus ex machina,"" which implies a lack of imagination on the author's part. Ms. Picoult apparently couldn't figure out a way for her protagonist to work her way through the plot's challenges via the protaganist's brains or sheer guts. Ms. Picoult could have and should have done better.This book reads like she had a deadline to meet, so she went for a quick, coincidental ending to the disservice and annoyance of some of her readers. Too bad. She seems to get her story ideas from the newspaper and then sensationalizes them."
2,Too good to be true.,"This book starts off amazing. But the ending ruins the entire thing for me. Very disapointing and a cop out. As others have said, this book is about tough choices and the auther, in the end, breaks the tone of her own novel."
5,Loved this book!,Loved this book! Can't wait for the movie. I found myself not wanting to put it down.
5,Memorable,I read this book a couple of years ago and I still think about it often. I was not familiar with Jodi Picoult when I purchased it and gained a great deal of respect for her storytelling ability. There are lessons to be learned from this book and it made me question my own perspective and priorities.
5,Beest Read,"Jodi Picoult has an astonishing writing style. The book is all things; good, solid humor, writing style unique and never leaves you wanting and all of this touched with a ture bit of sadness. Did I mention a wonderful read if you have any interest in medical science. You don't have to have the latter, but if you do love the science, this then becomes a must read. I am ordering her next book soon. She has a gift and shares it with us. Thank you Jud!"
5,Very different,"I really liked this book, because the story line could have been taken from real life. I would imagine there really are children that feel this way. Lots of twists and turns."
4,Still thinking about the end,The book presents a moral dilemma that evokes a lot of emotion. I kept asking myself what would I chose to do if that were me? All the medical info was boring but I kept reading to see how the issue would be solved. Still thinking about the ending.
1,Fell way short,This was an EXCELLENT idea for a book but the writing was not the greatest and the ending was a total cop out. What a shame to let such a great idea fall short like this. I mean one son is an arsonist and by the end of the book he is a total hero and with no explanation??? Author needs to work on her inability to flesh out a story so it is at the very least vaguely believable!
1,Completely upsetting,I was all set to give this novel 4 stars up until the very end. The writing as amazing and you could almost sympathize with all the characters. Then the author oes something completely insane as an ending and ruins the whole story. I was extremely annoyed and generally upset by lack of disregard for readers.
4,The first chapter pulled me in.,"I was given this book as a gift and may not have read it had it not been. After the first chapter, maybe even the first page, I was captivated. The story is heart-wrenching and should not be overlooked."
3,"70% good, 30% daytime tv","The story was incredible most of the time, but there were a few parts i mostly skipped over because they read like daytime television. The relationship between the sisters was good, but i felt that the parents were too 2-D. i didnt mind the flashbacks, but i felt that the older brother's little drama could have mostly been left out of the story. Same with the lawyers. I felt that they should have just filled their roles and allowed the sisters to take the center stage the rest of the time because their drama had, really, nothing to do with the important issues of the story."
4,have a tissue box close by...,"while this book seems to have gotten both positive and negative reviews, i highly recommend it. jodi piccoult weaves a story around a sensitive ethical issue. it will bring tears to your eyes, but will also have you thinking about your own morality and your stance on such a difficult ethical topic. it also a great novel for book clubs because it can spark numerous converstaion topics.this book is a gripping page-turner that will tug at your heart strings. its a definite must-read."
2,Falls off a cliff,"I attended a fiction writing course at Duke several years back, and in one of the very first lessons, we were told never to end a book, story, etc. with a cliche or something that deprived the reader of satisfaction or resolution...and the instructor gave as specific examples endings such as ""and then she woke up"" or ""and then she died."" Too bad the author didn't learn this - I was most disappointed to reach the end of this book to find a total cop out on the plot - the protagonist dies, right when you might be able to get a glimpse of the emotional and psychological ramifications of the conflict that forms the basis of the book. That, along with the let down in character development, especially towards the end, the use of highly stereotyped characters, made this book a let down in the end. The author used a nice narrative form, and then got lazy with it. Gripping subject matter, but in the end, a result that mooted the entire point."
4,Jodi Picoult to the core,"Jodi is an incredible writer but she drives me insane with her tragic endings!! I can't give her anything less than 4 stars because of her tremendous talent but I'm a heaping mess when I've finished her books, an emotional wreck!! So that doesn't happen unless she grabs you and takes you into her stories with her and the characters that you grow to love!Can't wait for the movie this summer!!!"
4,"Overall, a great read . . . except for the ending","I am usually a suspense/mystery novel reader, but decided to take a chance on reading a Jodi Picoult novel after high recommendations from friends. I really enjoyed reading this book for the most part. The plot and character development were great. I felt a connection with each of the characters. I could hardly put the book down. I was in great anticipation as to how this would end and, unfortunately, was ultimately disappointed in this regard. I cried, of course, but I felt like the author took the easy way out. When I think of alternative ways this could have ended, I see there would have been room for criticism either way, so maybe there weren't any good options. But, I guess I just hoped the ending would add something more than it did. I'm going to try one more of her books, but if the ending is this disappointing again, I may be done with this author."
2,"a depressing, contrived book","I am probably not the right audience for this--this was totally off Lifetime TV. I didn't think any of the characters had his or her own voice except for the son. Nearly every chapter was depressing, and the ending was completely ridiculous.Only the medical scenes were believeable in this book, but that's faint praise."
1,Angry,I could not put this book down. I thought the premise was intriguing and the way that the author switched narrators very clever.I was so upset at the ending that I felt like throwing the book against the wall. What a cop-out.
2,"Good read, but ultimately disappointing","The book was very absorbing (I read it in one sitting-I couldn't put it down). However, I thought there were too many voices telling the story (at least 7 characters tell the story from their perspective) and that at times they sounded too much like one another. Also, a subplot involving the main character's lawyer was a waste of pages. Finally, I felt robbed by the ending. It undermined the integrity of the central moral message of the book; the ending would be better suited to a soap opera, not a work of serious fiction."
1,False and manipulative,"To the readers who've commented on the errors in her depiction of epilepsy, add also: 1. You can't tip cows (as Jesse claims to have done). 2. Orange zest doesn't come in a jar (note Julia's reciipe for eggs). 3. If you're going to have multiple points of view, they should all have different voices (all her characters are wisecracking, sensitive souls with bad metaphor habits 4. If one tragic situation is good for the story, that doesn't mean two or three (if you add all the peripheral traumas) will make it even better.Even in fiction, authors need to be honest and credible!"
5,Jodi Picoult is a master storyteller!,"I LOVED, LOVED this book. This was the first book of Picoult's that I've read & I can't wait to read more of her. I knew within the first few pages that this was a different type of writing style. She weaves a story by telling it from all the characters' perspectives. A heart-wrentching tale about a family illness & the lengths your loved ones will go to save you. All the characters seem true-to-life & their struggles believable. Sit down with a box of kleenex & a glass of wine (you'll need both!)"
3,Lifetime Movie of the Week,"This book is okay, but it feels so much like a Lifetime movie that it's quite hard to read and take seriously. Everything seems to be designed to be a 2 hour melodrama on Lifetime. Only read if you like generic Movies of the Week."
4,My Sister's Keeper,"A sensitive and thoughtful review of several complex issues, i.e. the human rights of the child versus the authority of the parent, quality of life vs the sanctity of life, the right to choose one's own destiny. The book was elegantly written and lovely to read. The ending was a bit of a disappointment in that it was a little to pat. A very good choice for a book club discussion."
4,The ending killed me,"This was my second Picoult book, so I didn't know about her ""twists"" yet. When I finished the book, I was so infuriated that I threw the book across the room. Oy!!!!!!!!! Why oh why did she do that?!I still love the book though :-)"
3,"Interesting story, but the writing could be improved","The topic of this story is extremely compelling, and the characters are interesting. However, Picoult's melodramatic, soap-opera style of writing really got on my nerves. Here's a short sample: ""I have always known his answers. What I've forgotten are the questions"".So if you like this kind of writing or are interested in the topic of savior siblings or bioethics in general, I recommend this book. If not, don't read it."
5,Hard choices are never popular,"I have read a few reviews and decided I needed to write my own. I thoroughly enjoyed the different presentation of this book. It wasn't difficult at all for me to keep up with each character as it switched back and forth. The ending totally surprised me, but it wasn't what I expected. I've heard other readers criticize the ending. Why? That's the way the story was written. In real life, we moan and groan how things turn out, but there's nothing we can do to change them. This was the first time I read any of Jodi Picoult's work, and if her other books are as well written, I will read more."
5,Great read,I read this because someone in my book club recommended it. It was wonderful and controversial; I couldn't put it down. A surprise ending will leave you guessing and probably in tears (as I was). I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a good fiction novel.
5,Awsome Book,The book was shipped very quickly and the book is a great read. Looking foward to seeing the movie to see how it compares.
2,Spoiler alert! Please skip this review if you have not FINNISHED THE BOOK!!!,It took an entire book to describe one sister's dying process and a couple of pages to describe the other??? Even the author played favorites!
3,interesting story--pc ending,"i was captivated by the story concept. however, the ending was a cop-out. too bad."
4,"Unexpected ending, need a box of kleenex","A friend gave me this book, and told me to read it soon as there is a movie coming out. I always like to read the books before the movie comes out, as the movie sometimes ruins the book.I loved this book. I have three children, all born healthy Thank goodness. However, I related to this book, putting myself in the mother's shoes, and wondering how I would handle the situation, if my child was sick.Not an uplifting book by any means, if you do not like sad tragic stories do not read this book. Have kleenex handy..."
4,Soul searching book,"This novel makes you search your soul and hope you never have to make the decision these parents did. My sister said it was a tear jerker. I was actually more upset with how the parents treated Anna like she was a non-person. I didn't really feel for Kate, but you never have her version until the end. I like having everyone's perspective of their lives.My sister said it was a tear jerker but I wasn't sad...until the ending occurred (I won't give it away) and then the tissues came out!! It was an unexpected ending, and while I hated it, I also loved that it wasn't the nice and conventional way out."
5,Different read for me but I'm hooked on her books now,"This story captivates you. It'll leave you feeling heavy but enlightened at the same time. You'll learn about sisters and sickness, hearts and healing. It'll make you appreciate your own ""healthy"" children. It's also educational."
2,I thought Jodi Picoult was above shock value,"This book was extremely well written and gripping...until the end. The conclusion was just unnecessary. Not the tearjerker type of book where you get a good cry. This was just cruel and meaningless. It seemed the only reason for this type of conclusion was shock value. Since this book I am scared to pick up another Jodi Picoult. This book ruined it for me.I loved a Perfect Match and had mixed feelings about The Pact, but this is it. I will not read another Jodi Picoult book unless it comes with a disclaimer."
5,Want my own copy!,"I think this book is one of the best books I have ever read. I laughed, got mad, cried...you name it, it touched all of my emotions. I checked it out of the library but will be buying my own copy to keep! The last book I read of Jodi Picoult's wasn't very good so I went into My Sister's Keeper wondering if I would feel the same way...boy was I wrong! I was deeply touched by all the characters, and like the way that the story was told from their different points of view. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
3,didn't love the ending but could happen,"I love Jodi Picoult (I've read most of her books!) I really liked this one too, however, it didn't end well. Don't get me wrong - I wasn't waiting for a fairytail happy ending but this ending just didn't wrap the book up well! On the other hand, life is not predidctable and this is just how real life might have turnned out!Up until the very end - this may have been my favorite Jodi Picoult book - but definitely not after finishing the book!"
3,Unbelievable,This is a very sad and difficult book to read. To have a child as a spare part for the older ill child. I did not enjoy this book. The parents had no redeeming qualities. They forgot about the younger daughter except for what she could do for her older sister. It is a very scary book.
4,Surprisingly - Enjoyed!,"I'm a mystery lover through and through and figured this book would not hold my interest - I was wrong...I listened to the audio version of this book and loved it. Given that each chapter is a different character, the audio version uses different voices/narrators for each character, making for an easy distinction in voice. (I actually came to dread Sara's voice. She made me so angry!) I thought this was a wonderful book simply because it made me ""feel"". How did I feel? In the 13 hours it took to listen to it in my car - I was put through every emotion possible - and that folks, makes for a great story. I definitely recommend it.After skimming through your reviews - so many of you hated the ended and felt it was a ""cop-out"". But remember, this story is about Anna. It was always about Anna (even Sara could never seem to grasp that). And guess what - bad things happen everyday to wonderful families. Not all stories can have that perfect happy ending we all yearn for..."
3,Cop-Out Ending,"Don't worry, this is not a spoiler.The book was not bad for its type, but the ending was a total cop-out; to go to the trouble of reading this book and then have the author use this ending is a betrayal of the time spent reading the book. Ms. Picault does not have the courage of the convictions she had tried to portray. No more of her books for me!"
3,bad taste in my mouth,"i'm giving this 3 stars because i, like most the reviews i've read, liked the whole book until the ending. i teach 4th grade and it seemed like something one of my students would have done. she might as well have the main character wake up from a bad dream. that's how bad the ending was."
4,Food for Thought,"""My Sister's Keeper"" was first selected and then rejected, on account of some slightly risque scenes, by my high school English Department for our Honors reading list. For the week or so that the novel was on the list, my eleventh-grade English teacher dispensed such intriguing teasers that after its removal I decided to read the book anyway. I regret that I did not have the opportunity to read the book with a group, to debate its ethics and see whether other readers had come to the same conclusions that I did.As to the novel itself, I often found myself longing for Kate's perspective, which Picoult omits until the very end. The voice of the victim is therefore almost entirely absent. I would have also appreciated narrations from the doctor and perhaps an objective character not emotionally involved in the outcome. But perhaps the objectivity is meant to be supplied by the reader, and with it the verdict on the debate."
5,Heartwrenching and Well Written,"My New Years resolution was to read 2 books a month in leisure... unfortunately, I could not do it with this book, as I could NOT put this book down. It is so well written, that you loose all track of time. You personally ache for Anna, Kate, Sarah, Brian and Jesse. You want to make it better, and you wonder what you would do if it were you, or your children. I highly recommend this book. It is truly a wonderfully written piece of literature."
5,Fabulous Soul-Searcher!,"Who was right? Who, wrong? It all depended on which character was telling their portion of the story. (The switching back & forth of characters took a bit of extra work on the part of the reader but it was still worth it.)""My Sister's Keeper"" is a wonderfully fabulous soul-searching presentation of one family's excruciatingly difficult choices. I have never before cried over a book but...this is a story that grips you in the gut and doesn't let go until the very last second! Don't miss this one!!!"
4,what anna said...,when people die and they go to heaven i dont think i would see so many old people. i think that in heaven people fill out an application and check how old they want to look. take kate for instance what ifshe never got to live 30 and picked that age no one would be able to find her because no one knows how she looks.... once you fnish this book remember this quote... this author is really detailed an informative
5,amazing,this book was the best book i've ever read. the detailed storyline is complex but easy to undersamd. jodi picoult keeps you wondering and hungry for more in this fantastic novel!
3,she should have stopped 20 pages earlier,"This is all I have to say: The book was great, marvelous, very interesting, till she ruined it in the last 20 pages. The end was out of the blue, farfetched, a disapoinment. I would have given it a 5 stars rate but the end ruined the book for me."
3,My Sisters Keeper,"The book was good, but definitely after seeing the movie didn't really care for either. The movie was totally different then the book and a disappointment. If you read the book first you would not like the movie."
5,My favorite book,"I'm an avid reader and I read this some time ago when it first came out. It remains my favorite book of all time. Touching, intense, emotional. I literally could not put it down. Don't miss this one!"
1,horrible,"I hated this book, worst ending ever. Every chapter is written from a different person's perspective.. I could never keep it straight... you never got into any one particular character. I kept reading thinking it would get better... uggg. I have never in my life returned a book after reading it... but after wasting 6+ hours of my life reading this I wanted my money back."
2,Disturbing and depressing,"It was extremely disturbing. It was also jarring because the author kept skipping around from past to present to distant past to only yesterday past and into the point of view of 6 or 7 main characters. It was hard to keep straight when everything happened and who it happened to. I liked that were no villains, just desperate people who made me both sympathize with and despise (especially the mother). There was a good twist sorta near the end, but the very ending was a total downer and it felt like a cheap contrived trick.Was the book interesting and controversial and does it make you question your own definition of right and wrong? Yes! Would I ever read it again or see the movie? No!!!"
2,Ending was very very bad,Like most of the 1 star ratings...I hated the mother character....but I was horrified at the ending...how terrible....The subject of the book is interesting but the characters were horrible..at first I thought it was a memoir but was quite relieved when I read novel on the cover...
1,"So, so bad.","The writer is trite, lazy, totally derivative and doesn't understand how a metaphor is supposed to work. I guess it's what's called a ""beach book"" or a plane book--because it's so entirely lacking in anything thought provoking it is best read someplace where your attention is going to be lacking. I think I sensed this would be the case when the cover's two rave reviews were from People and Entertainment Weekly.Anyway I finished it because I wanted to see how she'd end it. But, not caring anything about any of them, the ending couldn't affect me. Too bad, as the subject is certainly provocative.Funny thing is, because I read this long after the film came out (which I didn't see), my greatest enjoyment was picturing Alec Baldwin as the lawyer--and imagining him with the dog. That was fun."
4,Not happy with the end!,"Nice book, interesting and polemic story! Made me think about it! But the end... I couldn't expect it and didn't like it! I prefer happy endings!"
1,Way overboard on the melodrama,"I am very surprised that this book got so many good reviews. It literally is just one tear-jerking event after another, with several stupid harlequin-romance type subplots thrown in. The story is finished off with a totally unrealistic, very disappointing finale."
4,My Sister's Keeper....,"Great beginning. I found msyelf flipping through pages in middle. Ending was wrong...left a bad impression.Great storyline, however. I loved Jesse and Campbell."
2,"What's really ""Missing"" is some basic information","Fortunately I had the ""Windows XP Annoyances"" manual to thoroughly explain how to use Windows XP's Chkdsk utility. ""Chkdsk"", or any spelling of it, does not appear in ""The Missing Manual"" or index as far as I know, but it does in ""Windows XP Annoyances"". Something as basic and important as ""Chkdsk"" should not be missing. I wonder how many other entries are non-existent? Having read both manuals, I prefer ""Windows XP Annoyances"". Pogue's content reads like a rehashed Microsoft Windows XP ""Help"" tutorial. There's more substance in the other manual."
4,This book is a surprise of information..,This book is a surprise of information.. Pleny of learning here in this one.. Input after input it does not stop anywhere's in learning from this book..
2,Not recommended,"I can't in good conscious recommend this book to anyone. The only thing right about this book is the title AND the manual is still MISSING. Skip this one. Poorly presented, multiple glaring errors. Shame on you David Pogue!!"
3,MISSING MANUAL MISSED,"I expected more from this book since the title implies more information that has not been available. I didn't see anything in the book that was new.It is not a bad manual but there are several books that provide the same information. Perhaps, the problem with the book is the title because it leads one to think it will include more than it actually delivers.If you do not have a good reference book on Windows XP Professional, you would not go wrong with this book."
1,A really bad ballad,"I really liked her Ponce de Replay song when I first heard it. It sounded so fresh and catchy, a song that begged for you to hit the dancefloor. It was such a fun summer song, vocally and delivery wise.That's why I was really taken aback when I heard ""Unfaithful"" on the radio. I was like, why would any producer let anyone record a single w/ a delivery performance like that? It was like she was just going through the motion. And ballads really reveal weaknesses in her voice and how her style is not quite mature just yet. She also just doesn't have the power to belt out a power ballad like that. She should have passed it on to Mariah or Christina or Clarkson.It's fair to say that it was a wrong song choice for her.Again, not sure why it was a hit."
3,Not really That Bad... A Sad Song Though...,"Yeah I heard that her voice sounds rather like a school girl crying. But I don't think this single is all that bad. I mean, sure she really doesn't have the voice to belt out songs such as these. But if listen to the meaning, than this songswins the category. In fact, besides last years ""We Belong Together"" and before that ""My Immortal"" of such songs. Well this song would fit into their category just right. And I thank Rihanna for singing such a song because instead of just expressing herself on fast paced butt shaking music. Well she now can express what she felt on a simple ballad, and it really does slow down the pace. This song is really simple. A Good effort and very sad when you listen carefully to this song. Also listen to A Final Good-bye as well on the album. Very Nice. Over all it scores a minus B for me. Well done. Happy Listening people!"
5,Review,"Great service, better quality than most.. Won't need more for a while, but will buy from them again.."
2,Flimsy,"The product is advertised as being PREMIUM paper. These are the thinnest CD sleeves that I have ever seen. I will have to stick with the ones that I can see and touch, in the future."
3,Not bad,ActuallyThe Covers are a rather mild and does not contain adhesive glueBut it works and keeps the DVD - CD
3,Where's the Saffron?,"This is a very mild curry powder for my taste. And I was disappointed to discover that it has no saffron. The ""mellow yellow"" is what makes a curry for me."
1,Couldn't Finish,"I guess you can include me in the list of unwashed heathens who didn't think this book was a work of literary genius. I found the non-exploits of the Letourneaus and the Babbidges to be beyond boring, and I could not force myself to finish."
2,Depressing,"The characters are all really depressing and it is another one of those styles in which improper grammar and a lack of literacy is used all throughout it. It was the style that goes along the lines of, ""It was the store. I stood there. I saw. 'Hey watcha don' thwat ah thing fer?' He sputtered.""I don't recommend it."
5,silver bangle braclet,This bracelet is lovely and a great bargin! Shipping was excellent -it was a last minute Christmas gift and arrived in plenty of time.
4,It Is Safe to Buy This Single.,"Yes, it's Britney, and, yes, her last album wasn't very good, but it at least had two dynamite tracks: ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" and ""Boys."" Produced by the Neptunes, these guys take the Prince-flavored hip hop jam and give it a welcome remix that sounds just as good. Britney's still isn't much of a singer, but with a groove this tight, it hardly matters. ""Boys"" is a qualified guilty pleasure. Close the door, crank up the stereo, and indulge."
5,"Of course, its britney.","I think that this song is one of the greatest songs of britney, its really cool, specially the co-ed remix feat Pharrel Williams, I recomend you to buy at least the single, you won't regret."
2,It's okay..,"I like the song because I understand the lyrics. Any female whose been there can relate to this. But I don't and never will see this as a r&b;/urban song. There's nothing urban about it. I have never heard of ""NERD"" before. And after seeing them Im not impressed, and neither is the average r&b;/urban listener. If she added snoop, dre, eve, lil kim, dmx, etc then I would see it as urban. The remix sounds a little better than the original.I don't see this song as a growth for brit. This songs sounds like it came from the 1980s (janet jackson, prince and vanity in particular). So it's really hard for me to blast this from any stero system.Overall, this song is still pop. and she's very careful with not offending her pop audience (hence the reason why she got nerd). I have heard of better from her."
5,A solid introduction,"I had always been casually interested in Viking history, and while browsing at my local bookstore, this book seemed to provide an easy-to-read introduction to the Vikings. It definitely lived up to its potential. The author conducts a wide survey of the Vikings and their voyages from Greenland and North America all the way to the Middle East and the Black Sea. The text is entertaining and the author writes with a dry sarcasm that I found to be comedic. The only negative was that it was sometimes difficult to keep up with all the different names of various Scandinavian rulers and raiders. Overall, highly recommended for casual Viking enthusiasts."
4,Searching for your Viking Relatives,"Having visited Viking sites in Norway and read about their trading expeditions into Russia and Turkey, I was curious to learn more about these adventurers of the Middle Ages. I think the author does an excellent job of writing an informative history with some degree of humorous story telling. While it is easy to get lost in the similar names and the violent exploits of different Viking leaders, the reader will be struck by the wide spread influence these raiders had on civilisations in Asia, Europe and the Americas.Those of us who have European relatives should not be surprised if we find a little Viking DNA in our genome! This is an enjoyable book that provides a great introduction to Scandinavian history."
3,A little dry,"This book starts off great and I enjoyed the end. But somewhere around the middle of the book it is rather dry and kind of fizzles off. This guy beat up this guy, this guy married this guy. This guy pushed Christianity, Viking, Christianity, Viking... It is interesting, don't get me wrong, but kind of difficult to trudge through. What I found interesting is that the general idea of the Viking way, the plundering and the voyages (actually more trading than plundering), is how they lost their heritage. That they would leave their spouses behind and not really pass along the tradition. Also it is interesting that they were in N. America long before Columbus self-advertised his voyage."
1,Painfully dull,"How you can take a subject as brutal and intriguing as the Vikings, and write a book this dull is beyond me. It was a chore to finish."
3,okay games,I bought thisw game because it was bally so I expected it to be a lot more fun and the game requires that the disc be in to work.
2,Could be better,"I have other slot games by Masque and they are so much better than this one. This is a stripped-down version of slots. Graphics are OK, but they really cheaped out on them. There is no real ""casino"" feel in this game. (The other slot games by them are MUCH better) All the slots are presented in a ""video mode"" so there are no reel slots. Most machines lack bonus rounds (unlike the other slot games by Masque) and the max you can bet is $5. (Unlike $100 in their other slot games)Unlike the other slot games by Masque, this games feels like a game made in the early- to mid-'90s.I would recommend instead: Little Green Men or Larry's Lobstermania."
2,An okay Slot Game.,"I purchased this game because I really like slot games. This one was okay, not one of my top 10 favorites."
3,Bally Slots,I like some of the slots but others I can do without. I wish there was more different video slot games then regular slot machines. Two game plays came up and both are almost the same. But I still have fun playing them. You should have included some video poke games instead of all the regular slot machines.
5,2 Comedies,"MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE: Ronnie Jackson is a baby photographer who gets framed for murder. A mysterious femme fatale (Dorothy Lamour) asks him to locate her missing uncle, mistaking Ronnie for the gumshoe detective Sam McCloud. This detective genre spoof also stars horror legends Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney.ROAD TO BALI: In an attempt to avoid disastrous marriage proposals, two entertainers leave Melbourne and begin working as divers. Their work takes them to a tropical island - Bali, where they meet a bombshell princess and, forgetting the mess they barely avoided, vie with each other for her favours."
1,Be carefull,I use them for a year.. Some peaces of wood keep going out of the beaded and the wires inside are not well cut so it go out damaging my cloth. I wish Icould return them
1,too small,"the price is right,but it is not as big as it looks. The bottom is nowhere near wide enough to be comfortable, your legs are always half off and you fight with the bottom to stay put everytime you get in/out. (I'm a 175lb man) I enjoy beaded seat covers and I'm a big rig driver so I'm telling you spend more $ and buy one larger. It's worth it."
2,Even the books on MS products have bugs!,"Java coverage 70%, VJ++ coverage 30%. There are so many errors in their example code that the publishers of this book add new meaning to ""good enough code"". I truely believe that the publishers of this book never ran the code they printed! Ship! Ship! Ship"
1,sams teach yourself CGI in a week is very deceptive,"RE:""Sams Teach Yourself CGI Programming in a week"" clearly states on the back cover ""takes you to the next step beyond simple HTML""Having mastered HTML some time ago. Otherwise a novice re: programming languages. I find the above statement to be very deceptive and misleading.In the first four chapters I learned that the author has great knowledge of assorted programming languages. It does NOTHING for the novice and clearly exceeds the next step up from simple HTML be any stretch of the imagination. By this buyer/aspiring programmers estimation, this book should be clearly targeting the skilled programmer in any one of the given languages mentioned in this book.SUMMATION - This book was an unfortunate waste of over $ 26.00. $26.00 to some is obviously insignificant, To others it hurts. "" OUCH """
2,A thoroughly useful book (if you can fix all the mistakes!),"Well, I was a little disappointed with this book. I've bought a few ""Teach Yourself...in XX Days"" books before and enjoyed them, but this one had a few too many mistakes in the code to be much useful. Almost every code listing in the book has a mistake in it."
2,More like 210 days,I'm not very happy with this book. I'm spendingmore time emailing for help than learning anythingabout Java or working with Visual J++. The software provided on the enclosed CD and the text's instructions parted ways by the middle of the first chapter. I can't finish an exercise without getting stuck and having to wait a couple of days for an answer to my questions. I'm about ready to return this thing to the bookstore from whence it came.
2,21 Days to learn some of Visual J++,"The book starts well, but you immediately find that the Technical Reviewer may have been more interested in how the authors' names were spelled than the accuracy of the content. The source code for the examples is missing from the CD except for Days 19, 20, and 21. If necessary, take a few days to check other books before investing the time in this tutorial. The Technical Reviewer, Greg Perry, says (on the back of the book) that this book is Guaranteed Timely & Accurate -- I hope that it was Timely"
4,easily worth $199,I agree with the previous reviews in that this is not $1000 china but it is very nice for the price. I happen to prefer the simple design and the excellent finish. Maybe it's a quality control problem but my set from Amazon is just fine as is the set I bought from Famous Barr (a St. Louis Macy's owned department store).
1,Junk,This think was a complete waste of money. Didn't work AT ALL. I owe my brother a new Christmas gift.
5,ADDICTED!!!!!,"I saw Mr. North play with Eoin Harrington April 1, 2006 at Oysterfest in SF, CA. I had the pleasure of meeting Colin, the lead singer, bought the CD Lifesize, and it's been in my car cd player for 7 months now. I can't stop listening to it. Probably the best CD I've ever bought or heard. I think my longest break I didn't listen to it was 2 weeks."
5,Let Them In,"Yes!!! Mrnorth Yes!!!I learned of this band because they opened for a ""Live"" concert that I went to see. Immediately, I was hooked by the music and the performance, especially the singers' voice and showmanship. They sound really great! I'm so thankful I went to that concert!A friend of mine who listened to the album with me said that Mrnorth sounds like a combination of Radiohead and Depeche Mode, but more like the first than the second one. I agree with him although I'm not quite a follower of those two bands' music.In this time of music, in which I find myself struggling to adapt to the sounds, I have finally found a music group that satisfies my ears, at least for now. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT!!!"
3,bit too strong,"If you like bold, spicy flavored tea this is the tea for you. The cinnamon and orange flavor is robust and overpowering. Those that prefer a milder more natural taste of tea should look somewhere else."
1,Is this really Marketspice tea?,"Wow! What a letdown. I've been drinking Marketspice tea for over twenty years. I've purchased it both at Seattle's Pike Place Market and in grocery stores in the 24 count boxes. I must have purchased over 50 packages. This was my first 50 pack and it is absolutely terrible. The taste is very weak; there is little orange or spice flavor. I have to wonder if this is indeed the real stuff. It seems like a lame counterfeit. In my opinion, even a poor batch of authentic Marketspice tea couldn't taste this bad. I strongly urge you to buy only the 24 pack box of Marketspice tea in the authentic box."
3,much weaker than the original from MarketSpice,"I received a small pack of 10 bags of the Market Spice teabags for Christmas, and they were very strong and flavorful. This pack of 50 is weak, in comparison, and not at all the same experience. However, the package arrived on time and was well packed."
3,Not your usual Market Spice Tea,"Love MarketSpice orange cinnamon tea, however, this particular bag of tea was not up to the usual par. The cinnamon flavor was almost gone -- it didn't even smell like the usual Market Spice I have shipped in every year. My kids were still thrilled with it until I brought home some from another box (decaf) that I had ordered. When they smelled and tasted the difference, they chose the bags from the other box without hesitation. I know this tea needs to be properly stored and may not have been."
2,Best Tea Ever - Bad Experience this time around,"I've loved this tea for over 15 years. This latest shipment I got was VERY weak though... not even strong enough to make one cup. VERY disappointing. (Also, they are not offering Free Prime Shipping anymore? Please bring it back and I'll give you another chance!)"
5,Best tea ever,"Since discovering this tea, my sister Terri brought back some from a trip to Seattle, I have yet to find a tea I like as much as this one. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes a spicy orangey tea, lots of flavor."
5,Yummm! Great tea!,"This tea I originally found at my hair dressers! I had to have it, Amazon had it, quick shipped, and I enjoy it every day!"
3,Great product - slow and expensive shipping,"I am from Seattle so I know how good this tea is. There's nothing quite like it and I would recommend it if you like a tea with a kick to it. I was pleased to find it here on Amazon.com My only complaints are that the shipping was a bit expensive ($6 for a $10 item!) and I had expected that with the higher shipping cost that it would arrive sooner - it didn't. It took me 10 business days to get it over on the east coast. It was packed fine, but nothing special. Overall I am more satisfied than dis-satisfied but if I order it again from them directly I will keep in mind the high shipping cost and the time it takes to get here."
2,Usually very good,"Their spice tea is usually very good and fresh, however, my most recent shipment is probably not very fresh. In a previous shipment of teabags, I noticed that each teabag would quickly flavor a cup and a half of tea, whereas in the shipment I recently received, a bag will barely flavor one cup, and by the time it is well flavored, the tea is cold."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,"I love the whole concept of this camera but the camera is just pure crap! It's so cheaply made that I feel like it's going to break! It's fun, but frustrating. I should have saved my ten dollars and change and spent it on something more useful, like a porno video."
3,The Color of the Camera Looks Spray Painted on......,"This is a cheap and fun little 35mm film camera (without a flash) with the ability to do split- and double-exposures. Seriously though, the color of the camera looks spray painted on. Kind of scared to think of the chemicals in the plastic and paint, especially as this is listed on Amazon as a toy, for this reason I would not recommend it for children."
4,It comes back at you again and again!,"This dramatization of a factual incident opens in a quiet Connecticut town where a kindly priest is murdered while waiting at a street corner. The citizens are horrified and demand action from the police. All of the witnesses identify John Waldron, a nervous out-of-towner, as the killer. Although Waldron vehemently denies the crime, no one will believe him. District Attorney Henry Harvey is then put on the case and faces political opposition in his attempt to prove Waldron's innocence."
5,My signature scent. . .,"I've been wearing L'eau D'issey perfume for 10 yrs now. I love it so much. It's so romantic, in my opinion, but the scent isn't knock-ya-on-your-buttinsky heavy - it's light and tantalizing. I also get compliments from both women and men. The women want it, and the men think it is sexy! The L'eau D'issey cream is so wonderful. The scent stays and is perfect for layering, and the moisturization stays too! I love it. I bought two jars of the cream, even, so I won't have to worry about running out of it anytime soon. L'eau D'issey is my signature scent."
4,LEAVES A LOVELY LINGERING FRAGRANCE,"Miyake's Body Lotion has the same intriguing scent as his perfume, and serves as a nice prelude to wearing the fragrance.Imagination and innovation are hallmarks of designer Issye Miyake. Born in Hiroshima where he was a student of graphic design (think his ""Pleats Please"" line), he later moved to Paris where he worked for Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy.In the late 1960s he moved to New York and the salon of Geoffrey Beene. Just a short jump from there to opening his own studio two years later. The rest is couture history and today his clothing is worn by the very fashionable.Miyake brought the same exuberance to the creation of his fragrance that he brought to his designs. While it is a floral essence, it is enhanced with a variety of flower scents: lotus, cyclamen, freesia, carnations, white lilies. Base notes are sandalwood, moss and cedar.It's a delightful fragrance for women of all ages."
5,Great introductory and reference book,"Easy explanations, examples, and pictures make this book both informative and interesting to read- an excellent bookshelf addition to smad."
4,An excellent primer for the serious space enthusiast,"The reader will need more than a passing familiarity with algebraic concepts, but this book is written in textbook format -- what the heck, it IS a textbook! If anyone ever planned to launch a satellite from their own backyard, this is the book that will guide them. Want to be an engineer-physicist? Want to be an astronaut? This is the book for you"
5,A Must-Have for Undergrad Aerospace Students,"The Air Force Academy has hit a grand slam with this book, and Embry-Riddle was wise to include it in its curriculum. This book is the equivalent of my coursework in 3rd Class Physics at West Point, but it has a decidedly aerospace slant to it that makes it an important piece for any person with a need to understand space. The illustrations are of superb quality and add to the learning experience of more visual learners unlike the Introduction to Astrodynamics book done by the Air Force Academy years earlier."
5,Really great book,The book was for a class where we are studying rocketry and building a Rocket for the NASA USLI competition....This book is or has been used by NASA to train some of their employees. It reads very easily and is understand with little effort.
2,surprised at the high ratings by others,"the worst thing about the blanket is that it sheds. there is cotton material all over the place. after every usethe floor is covered with pieces of material. it is very soft and not firm/rigid, as others described, so isnot all that supportive when made into a roll. have been thinking of sending it back, actually."
5,Best Self Bossing Book out There,"Undeniably, In my humble opinion- the best self bossing book out there. It covers all aspects from the beginning who you are and who you want too be. It walks along with you to brighten your outlook on the future that me be within your grasp. Helpful tools to keep you centered and within a time frame help as well. This is a book that you will want to read, re-read and read again. It gives you the chance to grow your wings."
4,Great Book,This book is perfect for anyone seeking advice on working from home or creating an income without working at a job all of the time.
3,Inspiring but outdated,"As with anyone who is seeking a new path, be it career, spiritual, motherhood, etc., it's always inspiring to read encouraging words. And these are actually a lot of practical words, with interesting exercises designed to help you find your your passion. I definitely gained some useful ideas and brainstorms from the book.Unfortunately, the Kindle version is NOT the latest edition, so it is missing the entire Internet/web/ecourse/ebook etc portion of becoming ""jobless"". There's quite a bit on making an income via mail order business, for example. I also could have done w/o the stories of clients- for all I know, most of them are made up. I'd rather have had more content, fewer anecdotes. Overall though, it was helpful and inspiring book, just unfortunate that the edition offered for the newest technology... omitted technology."
2,I know that! Where's the 'beef'?,"I read this book and quickly realized all this book was going to give the reader is very general information of what I can do without a regular job. Some of the things mentioned in the book don't even qualify to ""make a living without a job"" Clean out a closet and sell $10 worth of stuff? Share a tip for $100? Will that give me enough to ""make a living without a job""? Why does the reader need to know how creativity is nourished? If I want to know that, I'll just google it. It mentions all the wonderful things a person can do with their own gig. The reader already knows this. The question the reader asks is HOW do I get started? Nothing personal to the author but this book was a waste of my time."
3,Too many of her ideas sound like a job to me,"This book talks about how great it is not to have a regular 9-5. But the ideas the author throws out might be just as much work or even worse. She really comes up with Hustle ideas for living without a job, nothing that is going to make you real money. The most valuable tip in the book is the idea to try make a $100 doing your business and see if it is worth it."
4,Searching for the answers,"It's a fairly simplified exploration of suggested ideas. I was searching for something deeper , the ""Aha,"" factor."
2,Dont waste your money,Dont waste your money. If this isnt your very first book on business startup then it is a complete waste of money. You could do this good with 10 minutes of free research on the net.
4,Decent Book about Doing the Psychological Homework to be Self Employed,"The book is a fun read with a lot of stories and exercises sprinkled in. It is not a rigorous book, but a book to inspire you to find your own solutions and find your own creative passion. I like the phrase ""multiple profit centers"" that she coins. It is not my favorite book on self employment and making money, but it is a good one. Oddly enough the author herself quotes a few of my favorites and apparently drew inspiration from those also! I think the key is to just get the idea and give it a chance. I would, however, recommend not getting into debt at all if possible and not be in a rush to invest/risk money in a venture. In the beginning, with a ""shoestring marketing"" the inevitable mistakes will cost less that way. The author does keep this reasonableness front and center."
2,"Nice, but seems to focus on those who can write or give talks/seminars.","This might be the right book for many, but as I am not a writer or public speaker, it did not provide the information I'd hoped. I do like the idea of multiple sources of income, though. The way corporate america behaves, I wonder if they are really human beings. Thus, the idea of not putting all one's eggs in one basket seems wise."
5,creating work you love,"I found this book to be highly motivational. I have read several books on this subject but found this one to be the most direct and inspirational. I wish I had read this book in 1993 when it was first published and think it is another book that is essential for college students and ""twenty somethings"".A great gift to give anyone who may be trying to create themselves."
2,Outdated and a bore!,"Although I felt there was some value related to ""earning centers"", most of this book is one quote after another. Some of the things that really bothered me were related to what she learned from her divorce and failed marrage. Not interested Ms. Winter!Some of the points of this book may have been valid in the early 1990's, but things are a lot different with the Internet.Since 90 percent of this book is quotes from others, the author should be listed as ""Barbara J. Winter, et.al., et.al, et.al, et.al.""Save your money for something more recent!"
5,I Love This Book!,"This is one of the best books I have read. Instead of giving lists of old ideas for self employment, as appears to be the norm for such books, Barbara Winter helps the reader find their own ideas by building self esteem, exploring their assets and abilites, and more importantly their passions. I had no clue what mine were as they had been so long subdued by outside influences (parents, traditions, pressure to do something ""meaningful"", as defined by someone else). Now I am busy exploring myself and my own ideas. I have bought this book as gifts for several other people too. Thank you Barbara Winter!"
5,Definitely worth the money. You won't regret it!,"This book is excellent. Insightful, filled with practical information. Addresses fears and concerns with making changes in your life, while giving good advice and solutions. Incites you to think for yourself about your own talents and gifts and how to use them to your advantage. I'm not even finished reading the book and have already thought of many profit centers I want to try. You won't regret purchasing this book."
4,Inspirational,Inspirational and fun to read. I could not put it down. I needed the inspiration in this stage of my life having learned in the past that the coprorate world or the 9-5 gig sitting in an office and traffic is not for my free soul.
4,Read Before Starting Your Business.,"An inspirational book about working for yourself. I found the big takeaway to be the idea of setting up various profit centers. Many entrepreneurs think they have to find one business that will support them, but Winter suggests finding various businesses that will add up to the amount of money you need to live. Winter also points out that most of us can live on much less than we currently make. If you are thinking about starting a business (or many businesses), this book will be a great boost to your confidence."
5,Encouraging!,"I will be the first to admit that I am not a fan of ""self help"" books, seminars or TV shows. I find them pretentious and a huge waste of time.BUT, this book is different. Aside from suggesting daily affirmations (which I do not do), everything else was just well written, good, down to earth advice.Don't expect this book to tell you how to make money. Treat it more as your muse that will assist in you finding your way.I read this book at a particularly low time in my life; fired from my job and cancer spreading through my lymph nodes and yet it still made me smile and actually encouraged me enough to make lists of the skills I have, etc so I could try to move on...and start living again.Life is still hard, but I love to go back to this book for inspiration whenever I need it."
5,great bang for the buck,"I read several reviews on DVD players with HDMI connections, and for under $100, this model seemed unanimously favored. Etronics had the best price I could find, online or off, although I was worried about ordering from them after reading some of the comments here. But! my player came in a few days, and I have no complaints whatsoever. I'm not a super tech person, but this player seems great. User friendly controls, and none of the weird problems that I've encountered with other inexpensive players. If you want an inexpensive no-frills and no problems player, I highly recommend this one."
5,You will love this product,"I have used Panisonic VCRs only for years. When I was looking for a DVD, I compared serveral. Such as Sony, RCA and Toshiba. I picked the Panasonic. It does everything that I wanted in a DVD. Very, very satisfied. Wouldn't choose anything else."
4,Good Upconverting Player,"I am very pleased with this Panasonic unit and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I had nothing to compare it to. I am using the HDMI connection - that and the upconverting feature warranted my upgrade from an older Magnavox unit. If you are looking for an under-$100 player for the same reasons, this is a good one to purchase. This one was actually under $80 and arrived on time in perfect condition."
2,picture just as good as existing DVD player,I am not sure why I am not experiencing the better picture via the up-converting most others are..I have it hooked up via HDMI cable to my Hitachi 50 inch RPTV HDVT..the picture is good...but no better than any of my other DVD players. I am dissapointed in the up-converting portion. 1080i is actually worse....and 720p mode makes it as good as my other dvd players.. I doubt my tv has a decent built in up-convertating system since its about 3 years old now..I guess my expectations were higher based on the reviews. As a dvd player..it would be 5 stars..but as an up-convert dvd player..I would give it 0 stars since its no different but will give it 2 stars to be nice..
5,This makes you SWEAT!,"I love the Island girl video line. I now have this cardio one, the tahitian hip hop, and the hula for weightloss. I havent actually done the tahitian hip hop yet though. This video is great! Your thighs will be extremely sore the next day though after doing this video. And you do bust a major sweat with all of her videos. The girls in the video are all gorgeous. I wish that I had thier bodies. It will take me awhile to get there..but hopefully some day I will. This is a great work out for beginners and intermediates. I definitely recommend this video and the others."
2,Missing something here!,"This can be a good workout, but again, Kili puts too much lap-dance style in her dancing. This is not a culture that adds that type of added movement. It is a ""sensual"" dance, not a ""sexy"" dance...there is a difference. Also, I am not sure if any of the others, who rated this so highly have actually made it through to the end, because nobody has mentioned the fact that there are 8 beats of music and dance steps left out of the last run through! Not only that, but the last time through doesn't keep time with the music! But, with that said, if you know Tahitian dance and can take out the added vugarity, memorize the dance, and ignore the dancers on the last run, you will have a fun work out!"
4,Very good for the waist,Good work out for the waist. I could feel it the day after.Shame that the box was broken during the shipment as well as the two other DVD boxes in the parcel.
3,Energizing,"I enjoy using this dvd but I wasn't overly thrilled with it. It is fun to learn the Hula moves and then do the dance at the end, but I did not find it to work my body as much as I had hoped. I don't see that much of a difference in my abs and legs but I do feel energized and motivated to get off the couch when I do it!"
4,"I like it, but it hasn't helped me","I like this book. I like that it's written by an Indian, who knows Indian food but that it reflects Indian food as interpreted by top restaurant chefs. I like the description of the ingredients and the ""insider"" feeling you get while reading it. That said, I've cooked two or three recipes from this book and they have been less than successful. I'm still giving it 4 stars because I'm sure /I/ am cursed with the inability to cook Indian food, no matter the recipe. I love Indian food, it's my favorite cuisine in the world, but I just can't cook it. It's not the book's fault."
3,low quality printing job,Good content - but production values are cheap. Stinky ink on low quality paper - looks like bound photocopies. Plates are higher quality. Disappointing for the price.
2,BAD PORTRAYAL,"As an Indian, I strongly feel that Pearl Buck has not done a good job of portraying a real Indian character. Her descriptive writing is great, however the characters she has, such as Jagat, are not portrayed as a proper Indian. Pearl Buck might have tried to intertwine East and West together in this book, but in the attempt, she strechted the ""trueness"" of the character, resulting in the characters to sound fake. For a traveller who has never gone to India or travelled in it, it will reveal the beauty of this country. However, if this book is to be read to know about the Indian culture, this is clearly not the book to read."
1,Stick with China,"I have read most of the books that Pearl Book wrote and this is the only one that I found to be lacking. Her books that are set in China have been fascinating to read and some of them, like The Good Earth, I have read more than once. I think it is misleading to include this with the ""Oriental Novels of Pearl S. Buck."""
3,It's not silver,"Nice item, but be aware that the image on the sales page is wrong. The car is dark green, not silver. At least mine is.Otherwise, it's a neat little toy and will look nice on display, but since I was buying it as a gift for someone who has a silver SLK, I was a little disappointed when I opened the box."
5,An astounding album!,"This is one of those rare albums that has no 'mediocre' tracks--every single song on this album is powerful, well-written, and well-crafted. Every note and every word belongs exactly where it is. To change anything would be tragic--this album is musical bliss. I can't stop listening to it, and I never get tired of it!"
2,No Gracias for this non Spanish speaker,"I am a fan of the Langenscheidt pocket dictionary series. The size is perfect for travel, as is the bendable plastic cover. I was torn between this book and the plain dictionary for a Central America trip. I have never taken any Spanish so I bought the phrasebook because it said it's a ""Travel Dictionary and Grammer"" book. Unfortunately, the format is clumsy to use. It is broken down into sections such as Food/Drinks; accommodations; travel; shopping etc. While it's a good idea, unforunately, it was not very practical. Also, the ""dictionary"" portion at the end of the book was not thought out well as some common words such as ""seafood"" and ""shrimp"" were missing. I did find it odd that other words that a traveler wouldn't really need seemed to be in there.I would not recommend this book as a stand alone source if you are traveling. Instead, grab the pocket dictionary."
4,amazon extreme,"Several years ago, I read Joe Kane's ""Running the Amazon"" and I was interested to hear how Angus' journey compared. Not surprisingly ""Amazon Extreme"" proved to be every bit as exciting. The part that intrigued me the most was their budget. These three young men had just over ten thousand dollars for the entire five month journey - and that included their transportation and equipment. It is easy to see that the sheer determination of these men is what carried them across the South American Continent in one piece. For those of you who read this book, prepare to be inspired. Perhaps the writing isn't the best in the world, but the non-stop adventure more than makes up for it. Definitely worth reading!"
5,Extremely extreme,I came across this book at my local library and decided to check it out as my husband and I are whitewater canoeists and have travelled (some) in Peru. Wow! A very good read. Then I decided this would be a great gift for my son-in-law. He has done a little canoeing with us and has done a lot of mountain climbing and back-country adventures. This will be one of his birthday gifts next week. I know he will enjoy it as we did.
3,Simply Wasn't...,"This book simply wasn't all that good. The adventure was amazing, the book it's self not so much. While I love Angus' wander-lust, his writing is bit repetitive and makes the book somewhat forgetable. I have a hard time really seeing what he sees and trully understanding what his adventure meant to him. I think I was looking for something a bit different. I was hoping to read another person's account of a pilgramige. I want to hear a traveler's soul speak through the book. While the book is gushing with action and suspense, (Of course, they nearly died), it didn't fill me in the way I had hoped. A Dissapointment over all but if you're just looking for action in plain language, this is your book."
2,Not quite right,I have been wearing a sleeping aid like this for over 10 years. When they wear out I get a new one. I tried this one but it is hard to get used to . Too much material behind your head and not quite enough to support your chin and cover your mouth. I suffer from a dry mouth because my mouth hangs open while I sleep causing me to wake up every few hours. maybe with a few alterations I can get it to fit better. I prefer the ones with both straps going over head.
4,"Not his best, but I have to be fair, nice job David","I have owned this CD for about a year now, and I dont know what it is, but I seem to be listening to it less and less....Maybe it is because I have had more David albums to listen to lately and this one was in sense ""lost in the crowd""...... But anyway, this album is still very good. Unfortunetly I feel it was slighty inferior to David's prior release ""David Cassidy"" (oop), but regurdless of all of these things, I still feel the album is worth getting....Dont not buy it because I got tired of listening to it after a year of nonstop listening, David Cassidy has done it again :)"
3,Not my favorite.,"For an album produced in 1992, this has a very 1985 feel. It's a good album, but not my favorite DC effort. 'Old trick, new dog' still #1 with me."
1,Not the best way to enter the 90s,"I'll keep this short and sweet: this CD ranks as one of one of the top 5 worst albums in my extensive collection, simply because I could not get into his music. I bought it at a discount as a follow-up to his ""David Cassidy"" comeback CD from the previous year (which contained the brilliant ""Lying to Myself), figured I couldn't really go wrong. Oh well, there went $5. Somebody must've liked this very dated and mellow album, but it was not my taste at all."
5,Best diaper cover i have found,"I love this diaper cover. It is soft, snug and no leaks even from my heavy wetter. The velcro does not touch my baby like in the bummis or bumkins, and there is a ""hood"" that keeps the diaper from comming out the top. love it."
3,Has a little information but overpriced,"If you don't know where to start with fusing a wallhanging or decorative quilt, this book has some good pointers. It is especially good for describing the steps to take for fusing the ""glue"" and applying the resulting appliques, but that's about it. The projects are extremely elementary, which would have been fine, except the price of the book implies something a bit weightier, in my opinion. The pictures are of extremely poor quality. It is obvious that the colors are much darker than the original pieces and the colors are dull (except for the cover picture). I think most of the information in this book can be easily found in a brief online search."
2,Not so good,"Regular quality,in my case after a couple of games and some adjustments it starting loosing CO2 from the join with the vertical access it actually rotates so is something that might happen. I had to buy a macro line kit instead."
3,Great Hero,"The hero is a socially awkward man, who doesn't really have any friends. He helps the heroine in her quest to find her son. Definitely a unique story with unique characters for romance."
4,"Heartbreaker, page-turner...","This was a good read, dealing with a heartbreaking subject (child abductions). I put off reading this for a long time, worrying that the emotional intensity would be too much. I'm glad I finally took a chance. It *was* intense, but manageable. The plot was good, but the pacing was a little spotty. It was too slow for the first 30% of the book, then too fast toward the end, with major scenes taking place ""off-camera,"" when they should've been part of the main story. (I don't want to post spoilers, so won't go into detail.) Overall, however, it was a good, emotional read."
1,cry forever what a let down,"I was rather disappointed in this book after waiting for so long for it to come out and my shear love of Linda Howard books. I am coming off an emotional high from books like mr perfect, mckenzie's mountain, now you see her now you don't, and dying to please (which was my favorite book). It pained me greatly to see that the mother's story begins and ends in pain. Don't read this book unless you like pain. Want a good romance novel? Read Dying to Please."
2,A Rare Linda Howard Disappointment--No spoilers,"As a diehard fan of Linda Howard, I was disappointed with this hybrid of mainstream suspense and romance novel. It doesn't succeed on either level. There is no payoff for the suspense--we hear of the resolution second-hand--just an emotional bathos that far exceeds the excesses of most romance novels and therefore fails to satisfy in that area as well. Nothing kills a good romance like a long, drawn-out tragedy, and even Ms. Howard can't save this one. This is a Sufferin' Oprah book club selection minus the literary content. If you must read Linda Howard, as many of us must, wait for the paperback."
4,Some of Howards books make me laugh and some make me cry.,"Cry No More is probably the best book I've ever read. It's hard for me not to say that after I've read a Linda Howard book, because she's an amazing writer, but this one can't NOT touch you.Just do me a favor - if you haven't read it yet, please read it. It's worth it."
4,But have a hankie handy anyway......,"I've read 99% of Linda Howard's books. When you travel a lot, you need a good book to wait in airports with. This one is a keeper! Mira's baby' kidnapping was a Mother's nightmare! and you root for Mira the entire book. But the real stuff begins when she meets Diaz. Wow!!! Their adventures after that are edge of seat stuff!!! He's a very different character indeed.I am running out to buy her latest ASAP!!!!"
1,Did I read the same book?,"I'm wondering if I read the same book as everyone else because as a ""Mystery"" book, this one was sadly lacking. Perhaps it's because I'm new to Linda Howard and therefore not as willing to just accept this as just another ""brilliant"" work.Firstly, it took forever to get into the story, then there's really no chemistry between the two main characters, THEN we finally get to the resolution of the ""Mystery"" part, and it all happens essentially ""off camera."" The resolution to the ""Mystery"" is reduced to one short line of basically ""they were caught."" Well, DUH! I want to know HOW they were caught! Where's the confrontation?! Where's the climax!?This anti-climax was a major miscalculation on Howard's part, in my opinion. It ruined the whole book for me. Not even the ""feel good"" ending was able to save it. I just felt cheated."
4,Get your hanky out.,The title of this book was nonsensical because if you don't cry during this book you may be lacking a heart. I don't cry while reading books but this one had me leaking more than once. It was hard to read but really wonderful.
4,Linda Howard Is A Very Good Writer !!,I became a fan of this writer a few years ago. She writes stories that I enjoy getting lost in. Her characters are always a lot of fun and Ms. Howard has never disappointed me. She's a writer you can count on every time.
5,One of her best,"I read this after reading ""Open Season"" Did the same author write both books? Linda Howard writes such excellent books most of the time and ""Cry No More"" was definately one of her best.This book had a great story along with the sexy charactors. That sure helps, it was hard to put down till I finished."
3,It was a Great Story but a Huge letdown in many levels,"I have never written a review before but I had to for this one. I have read LH before and have always loved her books for the suspense as well as the romance. This was an EXCELLENT story line and I cried my eyes out (which i never have done before)!!! But...there were so many loose ends...and the anti-climax was awful...okay they turned themselves in and then....nothing about them anymore...then the last chapter wasn't even entitled ""epilogue"" but jumbed ahead about 11 years. which was nice i liked that but what happened to the relationship w/ Milla's family? did they resolve it? and i still cannot believe that all the drama in the story then poof they turned themselves in......"
3,A bit of a disappointment...,"I love Linda Howard's books. They are always a treat. However, I really felt this wasn't one of her best. I didn't really like the character of Milla. I thought that she was unevenly written and started to get annoying. I also felt that the plot drug on a bit and was a bit implausible. I don't read books based on whether it could really happen...I just felt that this was a bit too much. I can't believe that after ten years of no leads...all of a sudden everything clicks into place; all of these things just start happening and it is easy to find the answers. I think it would have been a better book if it had taken place a year or two after the kidnapping, not ten. It is not Linda Howard's best work, but I still love her and will continue to read her."
4,GREAT!,"I was looking for a good Linda Howard book...This one got good reviews...Okay...Lets give it a go...I wasn't disappointed...Milla has grit...I would want to be her if I were in her position...Damn Child Trafficking...A Heart Wrenching, but also a romantic suspense story not for a sensitive watering pot (that's near the end)...The relationship with Milla and Diaz was expected, but has it's surprises...I didn't expect the epiloge to be so...so...well...you will see...I would have liked more on what happened to the 'nurse' and the 'fundraiser sponser'"
5,enjoyed,"one of the better Linda Howard reads. Couldn't put it down. Interesting look into the baby smuggling operations in Mexico and how it flows into the United States.Like drugs, if there was no market, there would be no business for the smugglers. A look inside the heartbreak and danger."
5,Great Read,The wait for another Linda Howard title was longer this time but the book did not disappoint. I enjoyed it front to back. The tale moved along fast and had a lot of suspense. This hero was a dark one but went well with the storyline. Like some of the other readers felt a few back story lines could have been tied up a little (so we could see them suffer)and the last chapter could have used the word 'Epilogue' on it but don't sweat the small things. We read to enjoy a good story or a good tale and that is what I got. Yeah to the story tellers....Go Linda !!! Love Ya !!!
3,Left Hanging,"The ending of the book just left the reader hanging. After so much emotion, there should have been a more sold conclusion. Did they get married? Did they have children? What did they do for employment? I wanted to know. After I have invested time in a book, I want a complete story. I also wanted to know more about the villians. Their capture was just sort of passed off as an aside.There were some things in the book that annoyed me. Millia kept doing impulsive things which could have gotten her killed. How did she survive this long anyway. Diez was the one who made it all happen for her, then she hates him. The action which separated them didn't make sense either.An epilogue was badly needed. I felt cheated after investing so much emotion in the book."
5,I Couldn't Stop Reading,"I really enjoy Linda Roberts, from her early novels, through her migddle growth period to this stunning book. Roberts gives us incredibly complex characters, finely drawn, whose lives and issues pull the reader in and keep them until the last page. The main characters, Mila, her husband- then ex-husband- David, and the mysterious Diaz are all fascinating. When we find Mila and David divorced after the theft of their infant son, we readers have no idea that we will go on a roller coaster ride with Mila as she works through this difficult emotional loss as well as becomes a different person, one capable of dealing with kidnappers and murderers.I bought this book and kkept it, read it twice and found some new things in the second reading. I found it to be one of Roberts' best, and a marvelous read. Hankies, yes for some. Not me. Just constantly cheering Mila on in her quest and holding my breath when things got sticky.Worth every penny."
5,Good Suspense Thriller...,"I couldn't help but read this book in two days because the main Milla Edge, loses her baby in a kidnapping in the very first chapter! From then on the book was pure engagement. I simply could NOT put it down. Milla is in Mexico and she stalks the thieves that took her baby, and then there's the handsome stranger who creeps into her life, and back-stabbing ""friends"", this book doesn't let you go until you reach the conclusion to discover what's going to happen!In CRY NO MORE, there's suspense, there's romance, there's all the elements we love in our romantic mystery/thriller reads!"
3,Not the Usual Romance,"This book was very well done, and a great story, though it is not what I would expect from Linda Howard, she seems to be turning her writing to main stream suspense, which is a shame as nobody does a romance like LH does. I think I may stop reading her books now, I read books to escape from the every day sorrow and horror, and I like to feel good after reading a book. I didn't get that after Cry No More."
5,Wonderful story!!!!!,"I didn't particular care for Linda's last book, Dying to Please, she more than makes up for it in this book. This book is a tight thriller and from the beginning you find yourself really connecting to Milla and fighting for her son just as hard as she fights in the book. I bought this book yesterday evening, read until 1:00a.m. when I absolutely had to go to sleep, read some more when I woke up and just finished it off on my lunch hour. Such a rollercoster ride of emotions! Just wonderful. Keep at it, Linda!"
4,A Page Turner!,I thought the book was well written and easy to follow. One of the reasons why I picked it up was because it took place (at least partially) in Mexico. Howard did a good job of infusing Spanish words and little bits of info throughout the text in a knowledgable and believable way. The main event behind the story was both realistic and interesting enough to make me continue reading. I don't generally read romance novels and had no idea this was one (found it on a random shelf at the library) until there was a chapter or two devoted to sex thrown in there. It read like a mystery novel throughout the majority of the book. I could have done without the mindless sex and felt as if the love match in the end was very strange. I did not think the man was romantic at all. Overall this was a good book.
3,"Great writing, plot too sad!!","Let's lay it out first:Linda Howard can't be beat. That said, this book still comes back to haunt me months after I read it. Some might say that's a sign of a good book, and that may be so, but this book was just too sad for my tastes. Her baby is stolen? She's stabbed and loses a kidney? Her husband leaves her, remarries and has a new family while she's living in Mexico looking for her lost child? Yes, great writing, yes, great loves sceens, but just not worth it emotionally. I guess it's a testament to her incredible writing skills that she got me shook up. This book left me feeling sad and upset rather than happy. If you don't mind that in a romance novel, read on. If you'd rather have something to smile about, pick any of LH's other titles and grin away...."
5,Very well done and very emotional!,"""Cry No More"" takes one on an emotional roller coaster ride. Once I started listening to the audiobook I didn't stop until the story was over."
5,Emotional,"The reader can't help but feel the characters turmoil in this book. Not much is revealed about Diaz, which is probably the author's intent since Diaz's character is secretive and elusive. Any mother can relate to Milla. I really liked that Ms Howard allowed the darker elements to come through considering the storyline. Unlike other authors that write safe material about perfect, beautiful, uncomplicated people, these characters aren't perfect or beautiful, but very touching and complicated - just like real people. For this reason I could ignored the obvious villains and the missing climax of the villains capture and punishment. This was a smooth, touching read. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Not a mystery, but a great romance","This reminded me why I like Linda Howard. There is nothing groundbreaking here, but a solid and emotional romance with an excellent framework of character development. The plot itself is not the point, although it holds up very well. This is more of a traditional romance exploring the character and motivations of the hero and heroine, exploring how they fit in their world, and how such seemingly different people could find themselves together.Both characters have known their share of pain and lived lives different than they expected. Both, through knowing each other, come to realize that they need to change and open themselves to life and people in order to truly move forward. The quest for her missing child rings very true and gives real conflict for the couple, as opposed to the fake feel of much 'conflict' in romance. They have real and deep differences to work through (or not) over the story. A great read."
4,Great Study Bible,"I have a couple of Study Bibles, and although the NKJV is not my favorite translation, I truly enjoy this Bible. Just starting with the New Testament in Matthew, you can read the prophecy that was fulfilled by the first coming of Christ. Did you know how many prophecies there are about Christ, there are hundreds, including the birth place, the family lineage, the virgin birth, the amount of money he was to be betrayed for, etc. These were all written hundreds (seven hundred from Micah) of years before his birth.This is how we know the coming prophecies are true, because the previous ones have already been proven out with the Birth, death and resurrection of Christ. So what about the second coming? Some of these have already come to pass, Duet 30:5 Israel returns to its land (also Amos 9:14). Most of them will happen at some future date that only god knows about (Matt 24:36)If you have an interest in Prophecy, then this Bible is a great tool."
2,Lonely Planet's version better,"I read this collection as well as 'Brief Encounters' (Lonely Planet Series)- the later was by far a better read; more honest, raw, and real experiences by a better collection of authors recounting their many indescretions with the restless natives found abroad."
5,Fascinating collection of romantic travel stories.,"These touching stories are about reaching out to other people when you travel, seeking and finding interesting or exciting relationships. In some cases, a writer ediscovers an old relationship; some discover startling new ones. Well balanced and thoughtfully edited, it will hold your interest cover to cover."
5,Practical help for Christians to heal on several levels,Great book. Excellent practical ways as a self-help or for ministry to others. It gives examples and guidelines for how to walk through letting Christ do the healing and for getting rid of spirits in a non-violent way. Very helpful.
3,Okay Book,"Haven't read the whole thing, it does get a little wordy,(too much detail) but it is giving me some good information."
2,A Boring Read,"I was really hoping that this book would be a good book to recommend to others dealing with spiritual depression, however, it is more for a counselor than for the one who needs counseling."
5,transpore tape,Everything about this purchase was great! The item was priced extremely reasonably and it shipped very fast. Absolutely Perfect all the way around!
3,Impressive album,"Originally from NYC but now residing in the Boston, Ma area, FAR FROM FINISHED are a throwback to the SOCIAL DISTORTION days of punk except they have a killer rockabilly undertone. Not like any poser 50's band but their driving, punchy rock influenced beats will remind some of that style. Adding to this attractive feature are smooth but bouncy leads with gang choruses and a lyrical approach that capitalizes on familiar experiences of remorse, desires and embarrassment. Their music doesn't just appeal to one man, it appeals to all men (or women for that matter) who have dealt with such exhausting situations at one time or another. They are the voice for the common man and the music is the perfect accompaniment-raw, stripped down and inspiring."
2,Eh,"Works to do what it says (more or less). These kind of products are well reviewed elsewhere but this one's not very sharp so in practice, it either doesn't cut through the shell or penetrates pretty deeply into the meat. As sketchy as using a knife can be to score chestnuts that still provides better results."
1,It does not work.,We have three big chestnut trees and need to cut thousands of chestnuts a season. The Harold Imports CN1 Chestnutter is not easy to use. It takes time to put a chestnut into the cutter and then cut it. The blade is not sharp at all and cannot give a clean cut. It is much easier and quicker to use a sharp utility knife to cut the chestnuts than to use the Chestnutter. I used it to cut a few chestnuts and decided that I would never use it again. I would not recommend it for anyone unless she/he does not know how to use a utility knife.
1,extremely poor construction,"After buying 2 of these for myself and a friend, they both fell apart after several uses (the hinge pins came out and have been re-installed several times), the blades bent and lost their sharpness. A great idea but horrible construction."
3,Good for big size chestnut only,"The idea of chestnutter is good but needs some improvements. Due to the depth of chestnut chamber, the cutter can only reach the big size chestnuts. Also the cutter is not sharp enough."
1,Guaranteed...Or Not?,"After reading the review above, I eMailed the people at Jasco. I got this reply:<< Thank you so much for your interest in the Chestnutter. We stand 100%behind the quality of the Chestnutter. If you have a problem with thisproduct within 1 year of purchase (ample time to detect any manufacturingdefect), we will repair or replace it free of charge.We have thousands of very satisfied customers and I hope to be able tocount you among them.Yours truly,SharonSharon SiegelJASCO enterprisest- 847 972-1896 >>THEN I eMailed back and asked where I might find this guarantee on their website. No reply...~silence~"
5,Mine is great,"What can I say? Mine works fine and is the fastest, most reliable way of scoring a chestnut for roasting that I have seen. It works a bit like a cherry-pitter. You place the chestnut in the receptacle, close the holder, and squeeze. Open and a nice ""x"" appears. Some ultra-large or tiny ones still need to be done by hand with a chef's knife. Not a big deal."
4,Saves your fingers from being cut off!,"I bought this for my dad who likes chestnuts. It works well, and I don't have to worry that he's going to stab his fingers with a knife when he tries to pierce the raw chestnut before he roasts them. He thought it was a cool gadget."
2,Not an easy project,"I'm happy with the finished product. It looks nice, and has more room for shoes than I had expected.However, putting it together was extremely difficult. The directions were clear, but the pictures of the screws did not match up to what we were given. The drawers are assembled separately and are supposed to easily slide into the base of the cabinet, which was not the case. It was literally impossible to do what the directions said to. We had to actually disassemble the drawers, then reassemble them half in the base of the cabinet and half out. It took about 2 hours to put it together and my boyfriend and I couldn't talk to each other for the rest of the night because it was so stressful.I like the cabinet now, but wouldn't get a second one."
5,WOW,"This book is great for those learing tarot. It begins with a background on tarot card readings and then goes in depth on each card and its meaning. The last part of the book describes how to use the cards, including different spreads that can be used. This book is highly recomended."
5,"Once the Genie, always the Genie","For those of you who recall Bobby's late '70's work, this will be a pleasant surprise. In my opinion, an artist who can play all genre's of jazz is truly a jazz musician. And that is what Mr. Lyle does here. Sraight ahead, a little ""fusion"" if you will, and then todays ""smooth"" jazz. Then add a little Jobim for a beautiful rendition of ""Wave."" Listen closely to his improvisation over the changes. Thank you, Mr. Bobby Lyle.Dr. A Mancuso, Las Vegas, Nevada"
4,Smooth&really Good,Bobby Lyle is a Very Talented Brother who has been recording for a really long time.this Double Set is a really good set.I enjoy the arrangements&Versatility&His Covers of R.Kelly&Barry White are on Point.this is a Cool set.
3,eeeeeh,"I thought it started off pretty interesting, then went slowly downhill. It all begin to go sour for me when her suit would stay transparent. I kept waiting for the bad 1970s porn music to kick in. Things really got bad for me when it got to the point that the heroine could not possible make a mistake. She miraculously becomes a filthy rich with little to no effort. The author's logic for this? Oh, well, you see, she worked a few months for a business mogul as his bodyguard. Oh? Really? Then there must be thousands of filthy rich bodyguards out there who have done the same. Right? Oh, no? Hmm...I wonder why not? Lastly, I cannot stand when an author decides to make a couple fall madly, and I do mean MADLY in love with each other because they had sex. Sex does not equate love. Overall, I'm disappointed."
5,Great Sexy SF,"I couldn't put the book down. The sex sizzled. I loved watching the tough, sexy hero fall in love with Tessa. The science fiction worlds were interesting and well thought out; the twists and turns in the plot kept me up all night. I especially liked that Tessa was strong and feminine and how she used her brains to tame a man she loved. Tessa didn't hold back. And neither did Kahn, the hero. I was sorry to see the book end and can't wait for THE DARE. If you like wild and edgy, this book is for you."
2,Disappointing.,"Futuristic and sci-fi romance novels are my favorite genre, so I always start a new one with high expectations. This one let me down. It was heavy on the romance/sex (as in a Harlequin) and light on the sci-fi. In fact, the ""challenge"" was just a small bit toward the end of the book, and not even that much of a challenge. Should I change my mind and give it 3 stars for mediocre romance? I think not, because it should have been more."
2,"Sex good, story bad","This novel has a great premise, but is too rushed in some places and too detailed in others. The title is The Challenge, but the actual challenge takes up maybe 20 pages. The story also brings up some gender role issues that were addressed like 50 years ago! Its decent cheap entertaiment, and the sex scenes are good, but the story is compleately lacking and has too many holes in it to be satisfying."
3,Romance and sci-fi create an interesting mix,"Being a fan of both genres, I was looking forward to this book; it didn't quite fit the bill for me. Some parts were very good indeed, especially the characterizations. The challenge should have taken up more of the book; it was well done. Tessa kept repeating the same mistakes in her relationship with Kahn; he grew more quickly, in my opinion. I found many of the sex scenes distasteful and lacking in real connection to the plot or relationship. The balance of romance, sex, and sci-fi was off, and the author used too much repetition. I did read the next book (The Dare, but liked it even less). This book didn't live up to the promise for me; I glad I checked it out of the library."
4,clasroom purchase,I bought it to use with my classroom but that didn't work out because the material is copywrited. I am not able to make copies.
4,Great Resource for Spelling/Vocab,"I love this book! We use the 2005 edition as our primary speller in my seventh grade class. The lists are on level and the exercises help the students memorize and conjugate. Words are grouped in themes, which can be hard when it comes to formal assessments, but make understanding easier for the students."
2,did not get what i ordered ISBN,I ordered the book with the ISBN that i wanted but when i got the book it was a different ISBN number. the one thing i can say about this is that is that it shipped really fast and was in good condition
1,There's nothing I can say,"After being assured the book was in stock, I received an email informing me that it WAS NOT in stock."
4,Terrific useable suggestions,This book actually covers instances that you run into everyday with your kids and how to be more positive.
3,Ministry of sound are losing the plot me thinks!,"So, here we are with another Ibiza Annual. And sadly, it's still going down hill. Plugging as many of there own records as possible, containing only a very few decent club tracks such as Snap's 'Do you see the light' 2002 Remix, Hi-Gate's excellent return to form with 'Saxuality' on CD1 and M001's 'So fly', 'Mother' from M-Fator and Felix Da Housecat's sublime 'Silver Screen Shower Scene'on CD2. It's not worth buying this albumn for 5 decent tracks. But if your into your pop trance and commercial dance music, you could do a lot worse than this album. The quality of mixing is also so wooden with the lack of an actual DJ at the helm, which used to give this series such character, but alas, with a weak track listing this is not an album I would personally get very excited over."
3,"5 stars for the performers; for the music, rather less","First, let it be said that the performances by the St. Paul's Cathedral Choir are very fine all around. The music itself, however, isn't that interesting, IMHO. Of course, these works were never necessarily intended as ""great art"" to be sung in concert halls, but rather, music for the church congregation to sing along to as part of the worship services. Thus overall, a curiosity worth hearing once."
4,a sweet popcorn film,I had no expectations of the film when i started to watch but the young girl who played Hanna was adorable and drew me in to caring what happened to her character. Yes it is a bit cliche and yes the premise of this film has been done several hundred times in different ways but I really liked the film. It has a very sincere message about being liked for who you are on the inside. Its a sweet piece of cinema and I will gladly watch it again on a rainy day when I don't want to think too hard.
1,Shoes...,"Assembly is not easy here. Does not hold the number of shoes as advertised. States that size is good till a 10 shoe size.I wear a nine and there was not enough room. Forget about boots. Not a good idea to be free standing either, needs to be attached to the wall. No hardware was supplied for this."
5,#1 for organizing shoes!,"This is the best and quickest way to organize the families shoes. my entry stays neat and orderly with this. I was concerned about the plywood, however, this has held up fantastic!"
2,What chip?,"We actually ordered this card a LONG time ago. Amazon says we received it. We didn't. But...apparently if we ever did get, we would have enjoyed it. :-)"
5,love it,we love our leadsinger and it is alwas fun to get new songs. the chip was delivered quickly and in new condition
3,Good techno single,"I found my copy of this CD single in a bargain bin at a used CD shop in Sydney, Australia. I'm really glad I picked it up. The music combines a sexy female voice with part of the upbeat vamp from Michael Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells."" This siren sings her desire for the listener to follow her home as the bars close at 3 AM. Nice techno piece."
4,Very nice writing instrument,"This is a very nice writing instrument. It feels good in your hand, not too light or heavy, not too thin or thick. The ink flows easily, but not too much that you need to wait for it to dry. I'm a left handed writer, so I tend to trace my hand over what I just wrote, and with other fountain pens, I've ended up with ink all over my ring and pinky fingers. But, not with this pen. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I hate paying this much money for a pen. If you can afford it, I recommend this pen over similarly priced fountain pens."
4,GREAT LIGHT! Sketchy clip.,"I haven't had the light long enough to speak for longevity or battery life, however it feels and looks very sturdy. The candle power is amazing for a 1.5 volt light, I'm very happy to have a light this small and bright without a special (expensive) battery, it competes with some of my cheaper 3 cell LED lights.My only complaint being the clip is a little odd, because of the way it's made you can't move it all the way to one end or even close for that matter, so if you have it clipped to the edge of your pants pocket nearly 1/3 of the light is exposed, making me nervous about it catching on something and losing it. I plan to make a neck strap and utilize the lanyard hole to eliminate this risk.Over all an impressive little light, a superb backup for little more than the weight of a AA battery (it's a light light) :)If you're even considering it BUY it, definitely worth the money."
3,I've seen better for much less.,"This is an Ok lite. I have seen more output from less expensive products. This is a well made unit but the out put was disappointing. I think you are mostly paying for the name. I have no doubt it will last, and is handy."
2,Dissapointed in this Gerber product.,"I may be biased but let me tell you I'm a gerber consumer and love their product thus I like their line up of knives! But I am truly disappointed in line up of flash lights! Once I got the flash light I was like this is not bright enough at 6-8 lumens and for $18 the price did not reflect the products performance. I quickly gave it to a family member and bought another flash light from amazon that is the same price and shoots 26 lumes on 2 AAA's! With a far more superior pocket clip and has a push button on/off design. Instead of the twist/ on. Lastly, do not buy this prodcut there is better flash lights out there."
3,It's okay,"Not a bright as I had hoped, but very handy for what it is. Certainly it is lightweight and that is a plus if attaching to yourself. All-in-all it is okay."
4,"Very small, very bright","I read good things about this light and was surprised at how bright it is. I was in complete darkness, no light anywhere. I switched this on by twisting it and presto it lit up a huge circle of light. I don't know anything about how LED's work but I know they are way better than standard bulbs because the light was unfeathered, very bright.I don't like that it's a twist on, seems like it could twist on in the pack or twist off for that matter. And the bulb doesn't seem like its that well protected from a fall; if you dropped it directly and it fell into a pointed rock or something. It could use a clear plastic shield over the bulb in my opinion. But it is set inside the metal housing, just a concern is all without no plastic shield like you see on most lights.But I bought it mainly on recommendation of portability and the strong light it generates. Another thing to add to my bugout bag."
4,Powerful little flashlight.,I originally bought this with the intention of keeping it in the glove box of my car. I decided this based on the reviews of brightness and the claims of excellent battery life. However when the flashlight arrived it was a lot smaller than I anticipated. Now I keep it in my purse for easy access to a light when I need one. It is very bright for its size and I am happy with the purchase.
3,Too Much About Products,"The sparse information in WOUND CARE about caring for wounds and preventing them is superb, but the manual is primarily a catalogue of products. The type of material provided in WOUND CARE can be found in the detail sheets packed with wound care products. I found the book a disappointment."
3,"a list of wound care products, not a text on doing woundcare","if you're looking for a comprehensive listing of wound care products (dressings, gels, etc.) then this book is a good resource. my only complaint is that it is misleadingly titled. only a brief, introductory section of the book actually discusses wound care, and it does it in such a short space that it is useless to the beginner (because it lacks detail and specificity) and useless to the experienced clinician (because it lacks in-depth analysis and meaningful references). it certainly does list just about every single wound product you can mention, though. it should have been titled ""the wound care product PDR"""
2,Too much focus on products and not enough on wound care,"Received this book as a CEU offering. It seemed 3/4 of the book was on products. In some ways this was helpful as a comparison reference, but in this day of managed care, I can't use all these products. Would have liked more information on wound healing"
1,not good,Sorry to say but the picture is better then the book. the inside looks sloppy and it doesnt exactly tell you what wound is needed for a sertain type of dressing. you are way better off buying another book. i regret this one
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Bought 2 of em, for 4th and 6th grade. Both seem to have extreamly similar questions. The reading and language arts are complete wasete of time."
4,A story of Birth on another Planet,"Mary Staton's From the Legend of Biel is a haunting story of suspended animation space travel and an encounter with an alien world's procreation technology.In 2001-esque fashon, explorers from earth come out of deep freeze to find a planet with a single geometric structure upon it. Inside, a sophisticated birth process takes place.Serene, disturbing, a little psychedelic and very thought-provoking, this book relates internal and external struggles of parenting and child bearing through the lens of a spiritually and technologically advanced alien civilization.Biel is moving and introverted, quiet and yet very intense. Read it if you can find it."
3,Too much research,I found this book to be filled with irrelevant research. I had the idea that this book would be more simplistic but unfortunately it's to involved and makes no sense to the common man on the street. If you want quick straight forward ideas on marketing and advertising this is not the book for you. If you are student who is needing bucket loads of information to impress the lecturer you should buy this book.
2,A Uselss Disappointment,"I purchased this tiresome text after reading the customer reviews. While touted as a healing modality, it really is a mishmash of philosophies with an emphasis on the Qabbalah and channelled mudras. The explanations are tiresome, repititous and monotonous. While there is a pronunciation chart for the hebrew words, it is inconveniently placed in the back, which requires either flipping back and forth or photocpying it. The method relies heavily on muscle testing, a concededly inaccurate method. The ""healing"" method is never particuarly explained. While the reader is advised to have the patient think of or visualize a troubling situation and then perform a ""balancing"", these instructions are woefully insufficient. No doubt these deficiencies are addressed in the author's seminars.The mudras are beautifully illustrated but all in all this book was a phenomenal waste of time and money."
5,A Must Have Car Book,"What a great book to take along in the car on a trip. Good questions for adults to ask each other while driving long distance and something for the kids to enjoy also.Good, short questions about the world that you probably knew most of the answers to but forgot. Skip the fast food drive-thru, get the book.The Geography Bee book is a better buy."
3,Not for beginners,"Purchased this book to see if can get kids started for preparing for bee, however the content was very monotonous and in Q&A; form, not good for getting initiated.However I guess for someone who has been preparing for a while this may be good as a revision, test tool."
4,Great Supplement,"This is a great back-up guide if you've already bought some other bee guides and don't like them. Otherwise, the obvious deluge of questions and answers is perfect for any world traveler."
2,Could be made to work,"Fhe quality of the product is acceptable BUT it it designed to work with a 2x4. The trouble is that 2x4s do not actually have those dimensions. With a regular 2x4 the beam machine will not stay straight. A solution would be to get a 2x6 and rip it to the proper dimension. Also, it takes a lot of effort pushing and pulling on the saw to get it through a thick piece. In my opinion, it would be worth it to weld a handle onto the beam machine so pressure could be applied directly to it and not have to manhandle the saw itself."
4,Good Tool,Simple but Effective Beam maker. Takes a little time getting used to and making accurate cuts. I now have it busy making beams for a small barn. Also good as a chop saw.
1,Basically useless,"It is very uncomfortable to sit in, let alone ""sit comfortably for a long time"" as claimed on the web page. The diameter is only 16"" much smaller than necessary for average adults. That is, you cannot stably sit in it, especially when driving. Moreover, when sitting in it, the inside circle of the ring is pushed down which causes the outside circle squeeze your buttock, resulting a very uncomfortable feeling. I bought this because of my broken coccyx. But using this item can only make my pain worse. It is a total waste of money."
3,Keep it or return it? I'm sitting on the fence...,"I looked through nearly every page last night and the book is back in the bag with the receipt ready to be returned. Although I don't think it's a ""bad"" book, it's just not what I expected. Not all of the recipes are truly ""one dish"" and it's got a heavy emphasis on fish. The recipies in general are not typical meals I would be overly enthused to make--or serve. We are not picky eaters but I can't imagine making some of these recipes and serving them without expecting a negative reaction from my husband. We might try at most a half dozen of the recipes but we're not likely to repeat them. So, I think it's best I return it."
3,Too healthy,I thought it was too healthy. It had little taste and flavor and when you cook with all low and fat free items then it ends up not being that great unless you absolutely have to be on a low fat diet.
3,i think I'm basically not a cook,book would have been more useful if we liked more of a variety of dishes
5,A Gripping Tale of Forensics & Criminal Profiling,"On the trail of a serial killer, FBI special agent Victoria Santos eventually teams up with Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Mike Posten when he begins receiving anonymous messages from a caller who claims to be able to predict the name of the next victim BEFORE they're murdered. As the pair reach the crime scenes they discover that the murders appear to be linked by certain physical evidence. Following the trail of victims, they must determine whether the caller is the real killer or an informant. The story follows the action from victim # 1 to the end with interesting sub-plots that add intensity to the overall story. The suspense is nonstop; a thrilling page-turner that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end."
3,Annoyed in Philadelphia,"Get this guy a thesaurus. Everybody is smirking. Can't they grin, smile, leer, grimace, etc."
4,"well written, thrilling","Great book overall. It's never boring, the quality is there throughout. The characters are strong and interesting, the plot is good, the pace fast, the tension keeps getting higher and higher. The only thing lacking is 'style'. Keep in mind that most authors don't have a difinitive style and not having one doesn't make a book not worth reading. I just think 'style' adds that something special to a book of this genre. Nevertheless, it's still a book worth reading for the excitement. I'd like to read it a second time."
4,An intense and fast read,This is a good vacation book. It's fast paced and gripping. The characters are well developed and realistic
5,Par Excellence,i am a huge fan of Mr. Grippando and have yet to be disappointted. I read al ot of books of this genre and he stand out head and shoulders above the rest. I enjoy his work because so far I have only guesed the protaganists once and it was still a great story. I read them as fast as he prints them. The only problemis I stay up way too late and finish them way too quickly !!.
3,Not bad,"But the isues raised have been better addressed, see ""In the Heat of the Summer"",. An interesting villain but nothing earth shaking."
3,Roll somn pour somn,"It's a cool CD,The rapper with the deep voice was dope, he should go solo, the other cats were cool, but he just sticks out more."
3,"dope,but shake the booty shakin songs","The album was cool, but they need to tell 2 live crew dude to leave the booty skakin stuff alone the two rappers sound like G's and dudes beats is tight, but the bootyshakin song was corny!"
1,Education in the toilet,"It took me 5 minutes of using this software to determine that it is worthless. I tried the first ""strand"" of the math test and 5 of the 10 questions in this strand were incorrect - the correct answer was not among the choices. There were misspellings on several of the screens. Do not buy this product."
5,First Rate!,"I looked a long time for the 'best' book on lighting. I choose this text. It is 100% as promised in the promo. I knew nothing about the science of lighting when I began reading. When I closed the book, I was very well informed. I don't see how the data could have been better presented. EASY to apply! Excellent diagrams. I am using diagrams to think out my studio lighting setups. Will remain in my library as a reference.A book BARGAIN."
4,Great read and instruction for those wanting to take their photos to the next level,"Wow, who knew that lighting could be so simple, and yet so critical to the success of a shot. I've only started to put to work some of the techniques that were so clearly written and illustrated, but my shots have started taking on a whole new dimension. If you buy this book, you should also buy Bill Hurter's ""Portrait Photographer's Handbook"". There is some duplication of content, but each only enforces the other.The most inspiring illustrations on how andy why strict attention to detail in lighting, and how to do it for next to nothing cost wise, was the numerous photographic references to the artistry of Fuzzy and Shirley Duenkel. Many of Fuzzy's images were used in both books, and are EXACTLY the quality images I seek to provide to my growning customer base.[...]."
3,It's OK but has some layout problems,"The book is OK, definitely not the ""best"" book but not bad either. There are some very straight-forward instructions on studio and some location lighting, but not terribly in depth. The lighting diagrams are helpful, but at least one diagram contradicts the text (states that a light goes in a different direction than the diagram). Nevertheless, I found this book helpful, but still I need another text so that I can learn more basics. There were two things I found distracting. The first was some rather blatant plugging of certain photographers, whose photo examples I did not find particulary noteworthy. The second is extensive side notes under each photo example. The side notes are great, and very helpful, but they are so long they distract from the actual text of the book - making the layout very choppy. Still a decent text."
5,"JA IZ DA MAN, JA-- HE'S RUNNIN' IN RUNNIN' OUT, HOLLA HOLLA!","NO MATTER WHAT, JA RULE WILL ALWAYS BE ON TOP SIMPLY BECUZ THATS WHAT HE DOES, HE RULES, IN ALL UV EM SINGLES, CAN I GET A...., HOLLA HOLLA, AND ALSO KILL 'EM ALL, DA NEWEST SINGLE OUT! JA RULE, HOLLA HOLLA 'CUZ DA GHETTO'S GOT LUV FOR ME.HIT EM ALL, JA WILL KILL EM ALL!"
5,Ja Is THE MAN!!!!!,"You gotta get Vinni, Viddi, Vicci when it comes out. That album is Blazin'!!!. Ja is the best new rapper out there, no doubt!!!!"
3,Just what i gave it before,I'm the kid that gave it 3 stars before i heard the song- and now that i bought the single thats just what this single deserves- 3 stars. The song is good and and the the other 2 songs that come with it are also good for a while. I thought it would be a lot better since other Ja songs on soundtracks and JayZ's CD were great. Ja on his own is good but not as good as when he raps on other people's CD. His beats could use some help.
3,Sure i havent heard the song yet but its Ja!,Well this single is released yet (its like mrach 9th or somthin) im sure it will be alright since its Ja Rule. He reminds me of DMX who at some times reminds me of 2pac-my favorite rapper. I wanna hear what someone who actually heard this song has to say. But its Ja so it cant be terrible
1,What? No ZERO stars available ????,"There really isn't anything particularly edifying about a pure thug, whose voice resembles a geriatric patient fighting a throat infection yelling about godknowswhat over unoriginal ripped-off sampled beats.It's okay that people can find this drivel listenable - and they're entitled to, but just don't pollute my TV set with it every time I switch over to MTV! The Spice Girls are more listenable than Ja Rule - at least there's melody and some discernable lyrics!"
1,Don't get the single or album,"Ja Rule is just a fake DMX. You can tell everytime he raps or make an appearance on TV like Can I Get A video. But since he is on Def Jam you know he is unfortunately going blow up and go multi-platinum. What kind of phrase is It's Murda, I don't hear nobody using that phrase."
1,Intonation!,"Not having heard any other Thea King efforts, I hesitate to write her off as a clarinettist... but I'm reluctant to buy any of her CDs after hearing this recording. Compared to my other clarinet CDs, this one has by far the worst intonation on high notes and Ms. King seems to struggle, especially on the faster passages. There's some nice, relatively unknown repertoire on these two discs but the playing is really quite painful."
3,"Obscure, but nice.","In reference to your other reviewer, please note that the Penguin Guide gave this, essentially, three stars out of four. Perhaps I like it more because I only played the saxaphone! Browser, listen for yourself."
3,Should've looked it up online first!,"If your a chick expecting to see a decent flick about how an ex beauty queen overcomes adversity to take care of her family, then this is the movie for you. On the other hand, if your a red blooded American male who saw the box cover and was wishing to see some glimpse of Love Hewitt half naked then forget it, doesn't happen here. I had no idea this was a lifetime movie, had I known I woud not have rented it because I would've known what to expect. There are no scenes of Love Hewitt half dressed at all damnit, this is a movie about a woman who prostitutes herself to take care of her family, WTF. I guess JLH will wait till she's old and wrinkled to finaly take it off and by then no one will wanna see it..."
1,not really,i did not watch this show cuz it did not look that inturested to me so after watching it for a bit i just turned it off.
2,The Client List Movie,Well for starters I should have seen the movie first. I was so disappointed in the movie after watching the first season of the show. I enjoy all the characters in the show and feel they are better suited. Don't spend the money on the movie!
1,Snooore.....!,"Ok Guys,Remember how Sex and the City was about everything BUT sex? This show falls in the same mould and will bore you to tears if you are expecting anything erotic.Its a soap opera.And thats it."
3,just fair,This was not one of Love's best work. It shoud have been better but some of the acting was very poor.
3,Why is this so popular?,"This lifetime movie, now tv series, sells quickly at local video store. We enjoyed jennifer in ghost whisperer so wanted to watch this one, maybe get season one. However this film is only ok. As most viewers know, her character of samantha turns to prostitution to support her family. How can her husband, mother, and children not question how she can make a thousand+ a week for being a massause? The plot gets soapy half way as she becomes addicted to cocaine. The massage parlor gets raided and the women make a deal with the city and out comes the client list. The movie is ok to watch on a night when nothing else on, otherwise/ still not bad for $5."
3,It's ok but it was not what I expected.,Too much like a soap opera for me. I would prefer it to be a little more R rated but then again I'm a man. The ladies I know love it.
4,Jennifer Love Hewitt,I personally liked this T.V. series. I have seen some of Jennifer Love Hewitt's movie's and t.v. programs and liked the plot acting and scenery. Thank You.
3,"Very predictable plot. It teases of skin, but is a very modest film, not one single breast shown.","A very so-so movie. Predictable, despite the tease of massage parlor eroticism, there was not much skin, the massage scenes were not erotic at all. Really a goody-two-shoes movie. If you didn't see it, you have nothing to regret. I can't believe they made a TV series out of this, except it would be cheap to make and you would get some nice shots of Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage, which is commendable. She's a good little actress with a great body stuck in a mediocre venue. Would love to have seen more of her..."
4,Great scope!,"This scope is a good one. I've had a 3.5"" refractor but this one is a fine improvement from it and provides great views and good clarity. Have only used the supplied 25mm eyepiece but it works well for all around viewing. Am pleased with the scope and it is well made."
2,Not so amazing...,"I ordered these earrings for my mother for Christmas and when they came I was really disappointed with the quality. The cats faces had marks on them and they seemed poor quality for being ""sterling silver"". My advice is to really watch what jewelry you buy online, the pictures are sometimes miss-leading."
2,DanDR,"Book Out of Date, and not too relevant to today's programs-Firefox and Thunderbird: Beyond Browsing and Emailo today's programs"
3,Cute and easy to handle!,Bought several cookie cutters for my sister's baby shower. I wanted to give friends and family a more personal gift bag. This cookie cutter was easy to use and decorate.
5,A CLASSIC underground album!!!,"This is Esham at his finest. This is tha album that changed everything, Esham was always wicked, but he took it to brand new levels on this one. You can't front on tracks like ""Symptom's of Insanity"" ""Voices in my Head"", ""I thought You Knew"" and tha infamous ""Hellter Skkkelter"". Pure underground a MUST have for ANYBODY down with hardcore rap."
3,More Poems than a Journal,Munch Journal talks about his tormented relationship with Frou L and his unique view of the world through the eyes of a painter and a poet. It's not exactly very autobiographical.
4,Rigoletto,"I bought this production (my 5th version of the work) because the cast was used as the singers in ""Quartet"" a great new film."
2,Not in the condition I had hoped for,I bought this gift for a girlfriend of mine who is pregnant. The book itself is adorable and fun but when the book was delivered the front and back cover had dark scuffs and some of the inside pages had scuffs as well. I tried to wipe them off but they were there to stay. Needless to say I didn't give her the book along with her other gifts.
3,No page dedicated for a baby shower,"I had read in one of the reviews that this book had a page for a baby shower and a ""guest sign in page"" It does not. That was one of the main reasons why I ordered this book. Also I would like to note that when my package arrived, the front hard cover was slightly bended from one of the corners. Not that big of a deal but when people order online we expect out product to be in excellent condition. Overall it's an ok book."
4,Cute and simple record keeper,"Overall, this little recordkeeper is cute, simple and easy to complete for a new baby. My only complaints are 1. the metal spiral ring in the center - it makes it very difficult to write anything on the left page (hand hits the large ring), and 2. the footprint/handprint page is combined and is not large enough to accomodate both."
2,new grandma to be,"I thought this would be a great keepsake so I ordered it and would have, if we did not know the gender of the baby. There are several pages devoted to guess the sex of the baby!!!! That would not work for me since we all ready know. It also had information on activities to do a baby shower. Not my cup of tea. It might work for some people perhaps the person giving the shower who could pass this around the room for all to sign and guess and write cute anedotes."
5,My Life as a Baby is a Winner,"I received my first copy of this cute album as a gift when I had my first baby. I had so much fun putting it together that I tracked it down for my second and now for my third. Telling the story from baby's point of view is fun and gets mom thinking about how baby would really feel about all the firsts in his/her life. It is an easy album for moms and dads who want to record all the important events that the first year brings, but who haven't joined the scrapbooking craze quite yet. I love this album and plan to have one for each child."
2,cute but...,"This is a cute book and it will hold most of the memories for my child, however, when I purchased this book I had assumed it would be 8 1/2 by 11 (big enough to hold any papers I would also like to keep with it like her birth certificate) however it is not. Only after I recieved the book did I realize that there is a deminsion area and that it will not hold any 8 1/2 X 11 papers. Buyer beware, if you want to purchase a baby record book to also hold other (keepsake) papers that you might want to add then this is not the book for you."
4,Baby Book,"This book is ok. I bought it in hopes to fill it with photos but was a little disappointed because there aren't many spaces for pictures. It's a cute book overall, but not quite what I wanted"
5,Sensitive,It's very different from what I usually read. It's about informative things. So if you want information on how to be a better woman read this.
2,The Ravings of a Futurist,"This book has nothing to do with organizational change. It is simply the ravings of a futurist. There are plenty of good books of strategic organizational change, buy those instead."
4,Farmall 54 to 58,"Farmall hundred series book is an excellent book for anyone needing information on Farmall and Interntional tractor built between 1954 and 1958. Includes pictures of each configuration, and descriptions of various tractor options. Includes information on Kinds and Codes lists for most models. Great book."
1,Don't Make the Same Mistake I Did,"Pass this journal right on by, and get the older Wanderlust Travel Journal instead. The older version has a vinyl sleeve that makes it very durable, as well as pictures throughout and a great ""feel"" to it. The new USA version is exactly the opposite -- plain paper binding, no pictures at all (except on the cover) and basically, just a boring journal with THIN pages inside.It was a big disappointment, especially since the other Wanderlust products (such as the postcards) have much better quality."
1,Very not self contained,"Hi,I tried to read this book as I wanted to understand Bombieri'sproof of Weil's Theorem (Reimann hypothesis for function fields overfinite field)For me this this book was very hard to read- I spent alot of time trying tounderstand the first chapter-and did not get far.The book is far from self contained and contains some errorsI think that this is far from inevitable- as thereare books who explain Bombieri's proof- the new vesion ofSchmidt's book equations over finite fields, and I think Stichentoff'sbook algberaic function fields and codes- that are much moreaccesibleMaybe this book has advantages that I currently cannotappreciate- but If you're in a situation like mine-someonethat has undergraduate and partial graduate knowledge ofmath , and you want to understand Bombieri's proofand some concepts from function fields and algebraic geometry- I recommend you look elsewhere"
2,Recipes are great; but editing is poor.,"Maida's recipes are wonderful. However, the editors did a poor job of putting the cookbook together. I was excited to see sugar cookies listed under the ""Drop Cookie"" chapter (Finally - an easy sugar cookie!). However, when I turned to the recipe I discovered that it was a rolled cookie. Upon further investigation I discovered about 20 recipes in the wrong sections. Since the recipes are reprints, the editors didn't really have anything to do except sort the recipes. It was disappointing that they didn't take the time to do a decent job."
5,Better than Grandma,"I am a lousy cook, and I don't really enjoy the whole process. But Maida Heatter's Cookies is like being coached by the most patient grandmother in the world. Not only are the cookies delicious, but the writing is so supportive, I feel that none of the recipes are beyond my ability. When I'm in the mood to bake, I always go here, and my only concern is whether I have the ingredients, never whether I have the expertise. One note to cooks like me: many recipes call for parchment paper, which I'm sure is wonderful but since I don't have any I don't bother and they all seem to come out just fine. In short, I highly recommend this book, and regularly give it as gifts, to rave reviews."
5,Beyond delicious!,"I just made the brownies with peppermint patties from this cookbook--a bit involved, but describing them would be very challenging as they are TOO DELICIOUS! The recipes are all good ones, fun to make and each cookie is better than the last. You will enjoy this cookbook and it would make a great gift."
5,"Buy it, bake it, love it!","For beginning or experienced bakers, this is a fantastic book. It is a compilation of all of Maida Heatter's published cookie recipes, plus some extras.Her instructions are easy to follow and precise, letting you know exactly what you're getting into for each recipe. You can't go wrong if you follow her instructions. And, for the experienced baker, she offers modifications and suggestions to customize recipes as your own.Many of the recipes have a short history or background blurb that explains their origin. It is fascinating to know and understand Maida's devotion to seeking out and perfecting the best cookies on the planet.There are no photographs, but her descriptions are as rich as her recipes, so you can easily visualize the outcome."
5,Maida Heatter reviews some of her best cookie recipes,Maida Heatter's lifetime devotion to baking -- especially cookies -- is very apparent in this instant classic. You will want to start at the beginning and try every recipe to the end. Special favorites are the Whoppers and Palm Beach Brownines. Only thing missing are illustrations. A must have for the serious cookie baker.
3,Not Up To Snuff,"Noting the price on the offer of this great book, I eagerly ordered. Unfortunately the print is too pale and also small.Of course the recipes are great !Cook books, as a rule are expensive. So here was a lesson. There are no bargains.I will share with my younger grandchildren who bake and will appreciate the exceptional detail."
3,"Good, but not great","I purchased this CD because I happened to hear one of the tracks on it (Alfonsina y el mar) while dining in a Mexican restaurant. This happens to be one of my favourite Spanish songs, having heard it performed by another singer whom I really like. Anyway... the rest of the songs are so-so and the artist's voice is somewhat grainy."
3,A RUSTY MEMORY,"MRS JOHN FARRAR RECALLS THE TRIAL OF SIR HENRY BROWNE HAYES IN CORK FOR THE ABDUCTION OF MARY PIKE, AT WHICH SHE WAS PRESENT AS A 19 YEAR OLD. HER DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL IS INFORMATIVE EVEN THOUGH SOME OF IT IS INCORRECT."
1,Beware of Benny Hinn!,"Don't be fooled. This man claims to speak from God, does miracles, yet contradicts God's word. He is a dangerous man that is leading thousands away from God."
5,The Anointing Review,This is an awesome book. Pastor Benny Hinn has helped me to see the Holy Spirit in a whole new light. I never thought that I could pray to the Holy Spirit until now.
5,Default is one of the best bands around,"Their latest album rocks . . . not a bad tune on the single disc. Agree with the other reviewers that the band's sound has improved over the course of time, with the latest effort being the most mature and melodic. Added bonus . . . they are a great live band too. Saw them play in Baltimore last night at a small venue . . . sound was excellent, and despite a relatively small crowd, band gave maximum effort."
5,Some Great Rock...,"Default's third effort is definatly their strongest yet. Like it says in the album description, this album is classic rock mixed with modern rock to make something new. Dallas sounds the best he has ever sounded vocally and the rest of the band is as tight as ever.My personal Top 5:1. I Can't Win2. Hiding From the Sun3. Get Out of This Alive4. All is Forgiven5. The Memory Will Never Die"
4,Drifting From The Path,"This is a good cd - not the rocker the first cd was and just a little less than their last. This cd shows the first sign of a rock ballad band in evolution.The few rockers on the effort are more of a commercial vein that blowing away the crowd type - solid, satisfying but lacking real depth. The ballads are good.The production on the cd is very good. The vocals and the instrumental backing are tight. Good cd to sit back on the deck with a good Merlot, the gang and a bonfire."
4,A good investment for a new listener!,"I have never known of Default until the single ""Count on Me."" (Though I did just learn that ""Wasting Time"" was their song...)While those songs are ""singles,"" they're are definatley more songs on this cd equally deserving of radio play.The majority of the front 9 songs are awesome, they all have great melodies with nice accompaniment, Dallas' vocals are truly a melodic rock listener's dreams. They are overall just great rock songs! ""All is forgiven"" is as awesome opener. The CD then loses steam after ""Count on me."" Only tracks 7 & 9 hold any luster for me after that. ""The Memory..."" is a very moving song, if you have any relation to it.Overall this CD is very good, though after track 9 it seems as if they recycled the same music...it gets so boring that the last 2 tracks end with you wondering what they were even about, because you were sleeping..."
5,Stunning Tatiana Troyanos!,This is a fine recording by Tatiana Troyanos and Felicity Palmer: both young and glittering singers at the time of the recording. Recommended!
5,A Victorian Curiousity But Not Only,"This book is a great survery of hells and underworlds in different religions. It is very well informed and covers a lot of ground. The Victorian style of the writer produces not a small amount of chuckling, while the illustrations are wonderful and very edifying. Although it has been 100 years since the original print date, there is no comparable work on the subject that has been written since then. Thanks to Kessinger Publishing Company for the reprint."
4,"Different, but excellent","If you're familiar with the Helio Sequence, Love and Distance will likely come as a shock on first listen. The dense, swirling, electronic ambience that characterized the band's first two albums is all but gone - here, the keyboards favor melody more than mood, and the vocals find a much more prominent place in the mix. And at first, I didn't quite know what to think about that. The album initially seemed to pale in comparison to its predecessors. But I gave it a chance, and by the 6th or 7th song, I was quite enjoying it. At that point, I decided that the band must have hidden the good stuff at the back of the album... but upon returning to the beginning, I found that I enjoyed it just as much. The album just needs a couple of listens to sink in.In short, Love and Distance is a big change in direction for the Helio Sequence, but that's not a bad thing. It stands tall as a fantastic album of upbeat indie-pop."
4,Nice and easy,"This is a really great indie / electronic pop album. I love harmonica song, and the rest of the album is really easy to listen to, yet somewhat more forgettable. I love playing this music in the background while I work or have friends over."
5,Extraordinary Performance and Recording,"I've been listening to this CD for the past 3 days, and each time my appreciation increase. Which leaves me wondering, why has nobody reviewed this recording? To use the vernacular: Unglaublich."
1,Strident recording. Lacklustre performance.,"I do tend to prefer ""authentic performances"" on authentic instruments but this certainly is not what I had in mind nor do I suspect that this is what Bach had in mind either! What is the worst about this recording is the harsh strident quality of the violin -- probably more a factor of a bad recording rather than a faulty violin. That said, I doubt that a better recording could have saved this rather dull and flat performace. Go for the classic recordings by Yehudi Menhuin or Nathan Milstein as an an alternative."
5,Charlie Murphy Charlie Murphy,Hilarious comedian. Can not wait for him to do something else; which I am sure will be even more raw and straight to the point of funny. Charlie Murphy Charlie Murphy have to say it twice he is just that funny.
2,Tepid,Charlie Murphy is not a legitimate headliner. There are opening acts far funnier than Mr. Murphy. There weren't enough laughs to justify an hour.
1,Oh my God who wrote the reviews the band themselves,"This SUCKS the big one. Do not waste your money. My friends and I got together the same night I happened to get a copy. I put it in to check it out. It is horrible...The worst peice of crap I have ever wasted money on. We used it as a frisbie, until it few out the window and hit a car driving by."
1,You have got to be kidding,"I hope with all my heart some horrible accedent such as a bus crash, plague, or flock of ill mannered sparrows should wipe this band from the earth."
4,Good Stuff,"Much like others much more famous than I, I also believe that the Chip Hilton series reminds us all of the basic values of life. I would certainly recommend the series to all young people, even at the risk of them being put off by Clair Bee's ""hokeyness"". There are great lessons contained wthin each story as Chip and his friends work very hard to navigate through their teen years."
4,Good for talkers,"In the summer I work as a tourguide on a pontoon boat. I will talk nonstop for a 2 hour trip, up to 4 times a day putting me around 8 hours. Talking loudly over the outboard motor noise, and into the wind. Needless to say I will ocassionally blow out my voice. These things are awesome for those blown out days. They sooth my throat, it gets me back to work without the pain. I highly reccomend."
2,"Average at best, forgettable","I picked up this paperback when I was short on reading material. Mysteries are one of my favorite genres and the byline on this one is ""Murder in Hollywood's Heydey"". I would say that it is adequately written, a rather backhanded compliment.Forgettable plot and storyline, no characters that are even interesting, much less unique or that you really care about or pull for or against.Not recommended unless you are desperate for something just to pass the time in the waiting room."
3,Book is mediocre,Gives you the bare basics for optometry words in Espanol. Some of the stuff I wanted wasn't in the book. A huge disappointment: the book is way over priced and is printed in black and white: boring! So don't expect too much. Haven't used the CD yet but maybe it is useful?
2,Too much grain,I'm trying to learn BW photography. Maybe grain is useful in certain photographs. But I was disappointed with the photographs I took with this film. In a better photographer's camera this may be useful.
4,Be prepared to send out,"This is a great film for beginners like me. I have developed rolls that would have been ruined if it were any other film, but the photos actually held up. If you have access to develop your own (which I don't) or can afford to send out (which I can't) then you're golden, and this is a great film to use. Just keep in mind I have not found a single local photo processing location, not even in the artsy city of Boston, that has in stock the developer required to develop this film and have had a really hard time getting my rolls developed."
3,Pretty good,The film is pretty good. Gets the job done. Shipping came on time. No complaints. Not my first choice in film but is good for amateurs.
5,Short of the ND6 documentation...,"... this is the most comprehensive book on how to use the Domino Designer 6 software. It covers all the features and functionality of the tool, and it will quickly become a marked-up and dog-earred friend in your development efforts."
1,ridiculously overpriced,"Get real. Big Imus fan that I am, no matter how good this is, no_ CD_ is worth a hundred and fifty bucks. no way, no sir, no ma'am. shame on whoever dares charge that. 20 bucks is pushing it. this is a total joke."
4,Comparable to volume 1,"I thought that Ibiza volume 1 is the best of all of the Style Lounge CDs, but volume 2 is definitely up there."
1,Ahout like the bubonic plague,I bought this program because I needed a security suite and this was recommended by multiple sources. I installed it and it promptly trashed my brand new Mac Pro. It took six hours on the phone with multiple very helpful Apple support techs to get this fixed - and I'm usually pretty good at doing this myself. DO NOT INSTALL THIS PROGRAM ON A LEOPARD COMPUTER!
2,great music - bad singer,"What a SHAME!!! This is one of the only recordings that I know of featuring the 4 songs of William Denis Browne... played very well by Stephen Varcoe - but sung terribly by Martin Hill. Much like the collection of Michael Tippett vocal music, Mr. Hill seems to scream his way through most everything he sings.Someone must like him, he's signed to Hyperion, and they usually choose such wonderful singers... but not this time. Let's just pray that Ian Bostridge or John Mark Ainsley will be asked to sing this wonderful repertoire... and we can use these discs as coasters!The baritone, Michael George, does a commentable job with the Gurney songs - sometimes a bit swallowed and throaty.I am not saying do not buy this recording... It's music that we should know and learn. But, this way we arent in the least tempted to simply immitate what we hear. You'll know you could sing it better, trust me."
4,ANAND'S MUSE,"The book delves into the feelings, emotions and travails as felt by some of the administrators, writers,social activists and reformers who have ';experienced ' India at close quarters.Curzon, Annie Besant,EM Forster, Chris Isherwood and finally Gandhi's experiences are chronicled in detail.The book tries to provide the reader with an understanding of India that is gleaned from the spiritual and pyschological processes of these visitors and tries to enunciate a depth of feeling. These 'outsiders'twist and turn at every corner in India and the reasons for their doing si might infuse an Indian to think more deeply , and accord the foreigner with a more intimate view of the seething cauldron that answers to the name of India."
5,An inventive and compelling book,"I never would have thought of the theme of this book, but once immersed in it, found it totally engrossing. India has been the great seed bed for many Western thinkers. This is an exciting way of seeing the relationship between India and the U.S...and a well-documented account of it with fascinating stories."
4,Good Album,"If this is the last album from the Dogg Pound it's a shame. Only 10 songs which Daz dug up out of his vaults (like he's been doing) from over the past few years. It has 1 Kurupt solo, 2 classics and 2 songs I skip. It features a few guests as well. Daz put it out after Kurupt went back to Tha Row so it has a message or 2 towards Kurupt and it also gets on Suge knight a little bit. A good album to have for their fans but the worst out of the 4 Dogg Pound albums, but it is still pretty good.#1 - 9.5 (f/ Nas -- another version has 2 Pac on it -- good beat)#2 - 10 (classic -- f/ Bad Azz -- good beat)#3 - 7#4 - 8#5 - 5.5 (f/ Foxy Brown)#6 - 6 (dirty song)#7 - 8 (about some h0e$ they know)#8 - 10 (a classic gangsta song w/ a nice beat -- f/ Kadafi {R.I.P.}, Big Syke, Napoleon, Hussein Fatal)#9 - 7 (upbeat song)#10 - 8 (Kurupt Solo)DAZ -- Delmar Arnaud -- b. 5/25/73 -- Long Beach, CAKURUPT -- Ricardo Jones -- b. 11/23/72 -- b. Philadelphia, PA; Hawthorne, CADPG!!!!!!!!check all my reviews"
2,Childpay,"This is a logic game, but is tedious if you are looking for a brainteaser. It is an endless saga of clearing mini-puzzle after mini-puzzle , most that are predictable and simple. A few are more challenging. This game could be good for 8 to 12 year olds, but older people may lose interest. Simple, but acceptable graphics. Point and click to play."
5,Quality After All These Years!!,I have been a revereware fan since I was a little girl in my mother's kitchen. Being recently divorced I found myself in the market for new pots and pans. I am just as happy with this set as I was with the ones I had for over 30 years in my married life which he got in the settlement. :).
4,"Facinating Content, Predictable Insights, Afternoon Read","This book was less about orthodox Judaism and more about mourning a family member lost to a cloistered group with cult-like similarities (isolated, belief in a divine mandate). The author's skepticism regarding the metaphysical underpinnings of his brother's devotion and his exposure of his brother's distasteful societal judgements (racism) confirmed his traning as a journalist. I'd love to hear the brother's side of the story in his own words - the reader should be trusted to draw the conclusions the author indends.Recommended for anyone interested in cults, religion and family relationships."
3,Parts missing,"The cart arrived as stated, so no problem there. I opened the huge box and sorted out the parts, bolts, nuts, etc.They called for 3/4 inch bolts to be used, which was not included. So, I ran down to the hardware store and bought some.Also, the assembly instructions were a tad hard to follow as well as what bolt[s] to use.Took me almost all day to get it together. I would recommend two people to assemble it because you have to hold a wrench on the inside of the trailer and the outside at the same time. It is ok if you have very long arms!"
5,An extraordinary treat and a tool that works.,"""The Fatherstyle Advantage"" is an extraordinary treat. First, it is well-written, an easy read, couched in clearly understandable language and sprinkled with just enough humor and anecdote to avoid any risk of it becoming a dry. Second, the skills and tools addressed in the content are solidly grounded in good research and science. Third, the strategies presented are eminently workable. Finally, this book speaks to both fathers and mothers in a way that clearly communicates, ""Been there. Done that. Made those mistakes,"" and lays no guilt trips anywhere. The book does not lift up fathers on the backs of mothers made to feel less than adequate. On the contrary, it marvelously celebrates the gifts fathers bring to parenting and the absolute joy that can come from recognizing and properly positioning those gifts cooperatively in whatever parenting structure exists in each family. Bravo, O'Shea and Windell. Five stars!"
5,An Excellent Prescription to Enrich the Quality of Family Life,"I found ""The Fathersyle Advantage"" to be an informative, insightful, and unique approach to parenting. Based on research, and including anecdotes and examples, O'Shea and Windell have created an easy-to-read and understand prescription for raising confident and caring kids that would benefit the entire family and their quality of life. I believe that mothers, fathers, grandparents and any member of a family will find techniques in this book that can be used to improve their family's quality of life."
4,Great Level 1 book,My 6 year old enjoys the book and tries to read each word as best she can! I think the story content is good. Great book!
3,no standard reading set...,"My daughter loves little pony series. That is whay I bought it.I expected more like phonics thing or some beginner's reading idea.HOwever, this book is just another little pony (I would call) toy book.I don't think it helps to improve reading. My daugher read some Dr.Seuss books all by herself. I would prefer to buy Dr.Seuss..."
4,Decent product,"This picture makes it seem larger than it really is. If anyone has the old Cosco step stool (with a seat that flips up and stationary steps), this is almost the exact same size. It is just big enough to fit those of us with larger frames. It is, however, decently comfortable and stable. The steps seem a little wobbly, and are kind of short, but also are stable enough to do their job decently. The steps also fit loosely in the tracks, and are prone to fall out if you pick up the chair and hold it at certain angles.Assembly was pretty easy, but things didn't line up perfectly. It has all the hardware and a few extras, and all you need is a Phillips screwdriver.Overall, this is a decent product. We use it in our wood shop, but perhaps it is better suited for more household uses. It is also available in different colors, so look around."
1,piece of junk,I was totally disappointed with this product. The legs did not fit onto the chair properly making it easy to strip screws as one tried to secure them. Once together it wobbles and is somewhat off balance. It's a shame that Cosco is the only one offering this type of chair/step stool. There really is no other choice for this retro looking chair.
2,Not a quality product,"Assembly was fairly simple, but overall, this is not a quality product. As a way of saving costs, the slide mechanism that allows the steps to be pulled out is a slotted piece of plastic that guides two pegs on the steps. One gets the feeling that the steps will fall off if the stool is picked up.I get nervous when my wife stands on the second step, but it works well as a seat for our 2-year-old grandchild at the dinner table."
1,Useless as a step stool.,"The stool is smaller than the old-time stools of the 1940s, so sitting on it works only if you are child size.The step easily becomes separated from the stool and has to be refit into place every time the stool is moved.The steps are very small and standing on them is precarious, at best.We were going to give ours to the GoodWill, but they're really to dangerous to pass on. Instead, ours are going straight to the recycle depot."
2,poorrly made retro stool,"I was excited to find this retro step stool on Amazon. But found it was very poorly made. Could not assemble itwell. The packing slip noted it ciuld be returned to Target, but this turned out to be false. Had a great deal oftrouble returning it., ad Amazon told me UPS would return it unwrapped as the box was destroyed. This was an obvious lie. I will only buy small items from amazon in the future."
1,Not very sturdy at all,Once I got it all together I was shocked at how flimsy the design was and how cheap the material seemed to be. I remember my mothers and there is NO COMPARISON. I am sorry I bought it and would not recommend it for anyone expecting it to last for any length of time.
3,One bolt short of 4 stars and one loose stool short of 5 stars,The stool part of the chair is somewhat weak. One of the bolts holding the back of the chair has already striped out. It looks like grandmas old stool chair however it's not as strong as her's was. Then again I was probably 150lbs less when I used hers. 3 Stars for its retro look. Minus 2 stares for its durability.
4,Like grandma's,"I bought this on a sentimental whim as it looked like an exact replica of my deceased grandma's kitchen chair. Assembly was easy until one of the last steps. It took me and my husband TWO hours to try to put ONE bolt in. (We're stubborn folk and I hate returning things!) The parts just weren't fitting together properly. Finally, my husband just used one of our own screws and assembly continued fine. I strongly recommend using the Handy Hint that is provided about greasing the footstool glide pin as I didn't do that and, while the slide technically works fine, it has a tendency to get stuck a bit.... and yes, the chair is a good replica of my Nana's. It just looks smaller than I remember but, then again, I was only little when I used to play on her chair."
1,I've been ripped off!!,"I bought this chair with considerable excitement. When I unpacked it, it was immediately obvious that it was but a fraction of the weight, sturdiness, and quality of the original. (We had one of these in my home as a kid in the 60's).I assembled it hoping that though it was not as sturdy or durable that it would work well enough.Assembly was easy enough, but...when I sat in it and then leaned back on the back rest the bottom struts ripped loose. So, I disassembled and reassembled the chair; tried it again, and...same thing. I absolutely assembled it correctly. The problem is an engineering and design problem.Not only is this chair cheap and flimsy but it is DANGEROUS!!!For the record: I only weigh 180 lbs. I'll not let anyone in my family sit on this stool. It goes back to Cosco or to the dump tomorrow.In summary, this is the worse consumer product I've bought in years. This stool would be a rip off at $5."
2,Teetering Stepstool,"Assembly instructions were easy to follow, and everything fit into place nicely. However, The four legs on the main stool are not even length. I thought I made an error in the assembly so I took it apart and reassembled it again, but to no avail. I ended up gluing a rubber pad to the bottom of one short leg to keep the chair from wobbling."
3,Should be less plastic for the price,It looks and works ok. Went together easily. They skimped in a couple areas by using plastic parts. One post in the seat stripped when I put in the screw. Hopefully it will not affect the chair. I almost shipped it back. Not close to the quality of the original. If you can find an original for a decent price it will be a better deal.
2,Retro Chair/Step Stool not quite what we expected.,"Our first shock was the price of shipping! The next came when we discovered a box full of loose parts and two kinds of bolts or screws. Instructions weren't clear about which screw or bolt to use and we stripped the threads with the first couple holes we tried to fill. It took us about 2 hours to assemble, though now that we've done it once we could repeat the task in about 15 minutes. The last surprise came when we put the chair on the kitchen floor. It's feet slid on the linoleum like the floor was ice. We have to put a throw rug or something under the feet to prevent them from sliding or someone is going to break their neck! The chair itself isn't bad looking, but isn't as useful as we'd hoped."
3,"Retro Chair Cheaply made! Not like the ""old"" days!","The chair is OK, but it isn't at all like the quality of the ""old"" type chairs with stool. The stairs slide in and out rather than lift out like the old chairs/stools. The seat area is small. I am going to flee markets to see if I can find an original chair, which I would rather have. I wish I could have seen this in person before ordering."
2,IT LOOKS LIKE A CHILD'S CHAIR,"THIS CHAIR LOOKS BIGGER AND WIDER ON THE PICTURE,HOWEVER, EVERY TIME I SEE IT IN MY KITCHEN, ITREMINDS ME OF A CHILD'S CHAIR, BECAUSE IT IS SOSMALL. IT IS VERY SMALL FOR AN ADULT TO SEAT ON IT!ON A POSITIVE SIDE, IT WAS EASY TO PUT IT TOGETHER READING THE INSTRUCTIONS.AT LEAST, I CAN SEAT AND WATCH MY 5 YRS OLD NEPHEW WHILE I AM WORKING IN THE KITCHEN."
3,Ump!,Not sure how I feel about this. It looks nice but the seat is too small and the steps slide around. They don't fold out like my grandmother's did.
4,Just what we needed,"I really like this chair. I was looking for an extra chair for the table as well as a step stool for the kitchen. Like another reviewer said, it's not as good as the old ones, but what is these days?My only complaint is that my children were able to make a hole in the vinyl in about four days. I blame that on the fact that they're all boys and they are rough on everything.Very satisfied with the purchase."
3,Not as good as the original,"I purchased this because I loved the one that was in my grandmother's kitchen when I was a child. This one is pretty good. However, it's not as good as the original. The step does not pull out very far. If you have big feet you'll find it awkward to step on. The step glides along a plastic track that seems like it will be very easy to break or crack. For that reason, I don't use the bottom step."
3,Be careful that you really want this type of music.,This is an exceptionally bright SACD- way too bright in my opinion. Almost painful to listen to and my system is not particularly bright. This is a very sparse rendering of these songs. Maybe I should have researched what this was more carefully before purchasing it.
4,Beautiful renditions of old songs,"I love folk & gospel music and Americana. I'm interested in the history of American music styles. I've experienced the Anonymous 4 in concert. And so I thought I might gain something from this cd. I did. I enjoy it, both academically and musically. It seems to me to be a modern rendition of old old tunes; if not authentic in sound, at least in spirit. The accompaniment by string musicians Mike Marshall and Darrol Anger is superb although for my tastes I would have liked even more from them. They just pop in and out occasionally throughout the cd. I give this a four star rating because the sound is excellent, and there just isn't enough of this type of music being produced; but I suspect that many folk, gospel and Americana enthusiasts may think it sterile, dry or boring."
4,Very good book,"If you were a Red Skelton fan you will enjoy this book. It provided an insight to Red that I was unaware. Red was a complex individual and had his bad points. He had three wifes. The first wife (Edna) was actually the best, but their relationship became platonic. She continued managing many of Red's business affairs for years. The second wife (Georgia) committed suicide on her second attempt on the anniversary of their son's death. That's right, Red's only son died when he was 12 or 13. Little is mentioned about Red's third wife other than how they met and that she was much younger than Red. Red disliked business managers and made some bad investments but overall had plenty of good investments to make him independently wealthy. Red had a problem with drinking, but was able to straighten himself out later in life at least of hard alcohol, while he still drank beer. His health was such that liquor would have eventually killed him."
4,Is This The Christmas Movie Starring Andy Dick?,"Amazon doesn't have any info listed for this movie Special Delivery, there is no info listed on what the movie is about and who stars in it but since it is listed as a childrens and family movie, and I realize that I might be wong about it but I'm going to assume that this is the cute Christmas movie that starred Andy Dick as a klutzy and nuerotic employee at an adoption agency who is susposed to deliver a baby to a family but winds up making so many blunders and winds up staying with the family until everyone of his mistakes is worked out and where he is liked by the mother, daughter and grandparents but gets on the nerves of the father. If this is the DVD for that Christmas movie it is a very cute movie!"
2,Special Delivery,I also thought it was the movie with Andy Dick but it turned out to be an animated movie. Not even a Christmas movie. Oh well my granddaughter likes it.
5,Great Christmas present,This was just exactly what we wanted for a second Christmas Present for our grand nephew. Arrived in plenty of time.
5,Crock-it,I needed a crock pot cook book that had down to earth recipes and this one has it. I'll be changing measurements for my niece who has a 1.5 qt crock pot with her at college. She'll be able to make these recipes without being overwhelmed by finding the ingriendents. New crock pot owners well love I know I do.
4,What a Great Crock Pot Book!!!,I bought my first copy of this book at a little gift shop in NC while on vacation. It did have a down home feel to it. I have since made many recipes in the book and I was pleased with all of them. I somehow lost my copy and I am now ready to order another one as I miss the recipes. Don't forget to try the deserts. My kids love chocolate and they enjoyed the recipes with the chocolate cake mix. Comfort food :)
2,not what it's cooked up to be,"Too many of the recipies in the book are not really useful. Cooking oatmeal in the crockpot is not a time saver. Some of the recipies are not even crock pot recipies. For examble, the recipie for chicken enciladas says to cook the chicken overnight in the crockpot, and then chop it up to make enchiladas the traditional way. If you didn't already know that, then you need a beginners book for crock pot (the for dummies series has one). And if you did know that, then the recipe is useless. All in all, I'm pretty sad that I bought it."
5,action pool cue,A very good pool cue for the money. Delivery was prompt and it arrived in good condition.
5,Great quality!,"Fun! I had a hard time finding this in science stores and someone mentioned to ""go online""...now I find everything I need almost online."
4,1st disc from criminally underrecognized genius,"Though this disc doesn't reach the sublime level of the utterly essential second disc, Honeyburst, it is still very much worth seeking out - especially the Japanese pressing which adds the superb ""Misty Mono"". The fact that Tim is not a superstar in North America is a tragic commentary on the state of the music business here.Superb songwriting, fantastic singing, mind blowing guitar work, and some wonderful mellotron."
4,Back on track,"Tim Christensen is now for the first time making an album without the former band Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, and he sure does this well. A fantastic album with not only great lyrics, but also the well-known Christensen sound, which yet again proves his talent."
3,Won't make you sweat,"I have been using KILI's video's for years. This was not my favorite. Not hard enough, not enough of a work out to make you sweat. Fun but just not really for getting in shape."
2,Hip hop?,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about...and yes, Kili is a bit un-Hawaiian as far as authentic Hawaiian dance, but she is a good dancer. And take out the hoochy-koochy, pole-dancing and it would bring honor to a culture that has fought so hard to keep this type of influence out. If you already know tahitian dance, you can do that, and this can be a good wook out...but if you don't, you are learning a style of tahitian dance that is offensive to the culture that it comes from. So, with that said, because I dance tahitian, I enjoy the workout! And as far as the dancers are concerned...they know how to dance, they just add a bit of ""nasty"" that isn't part of the culture. Take it out and you will be fine!"
4,Fun and different,"I bought this video because I saw a preview and it looked pretty cool! I am a Jazzerciser from way back so love dance exercise routines. I've watched the video and tried the moves and recommend watching in slo-mo to get a better feel for proper form, the girls are shakin' pretty fast! It seems to me that because you are using your abs so much to do the moves, that you will definitely be getting some toning action in that area in particular, plus cardio benefits. A fun addition to your workout video library!"
3,Poor editing job - so so book,"Because this book was printed in Canada, it does not use American spellings and was very annoying to read (because it seemed like the words were spelled wrong). For example, neighbour, colour, humour were used. Curb (as in sidewalk) was spelled Kerb. Mr was printed in many places without the period following the ""r."" As a stickler for punctuation when I am reading, I found this to be enough of a problem that it took away some of the enjoyment of the book.In any case, I agree with the other review who says that the first and the third stories are good and the second is ridiculous (and boring). Father's Day is the best of the three, dealing with a young widow, her adorable, precocious son and the smoldering handsome, aloof next door neighbor who is mysterious, yet alluring. Good, easy to read romance.I like Debbie Macomber's novels better than her short stories and recommend Thursdays at Eight if you want to read her better work."
3,hmmm...,just received today and i was looking for something with a lot of colors for my little boy's room. . . im not crazy about it however! i think it looks a little cheap and will probably send it back. just my 2 cents. im glad the other buyers were so happy with their set. i hope that i find one that works well for us!
2,"Beware! 95% of songs sound identical, boring, etc...","I love Chill compilations and have all the Chillout volumes 1-4 as well as Chillout 2001 thru 2005. This 6 CD set was a very big dissapointment, and I'm easy to please. Even if I find one or two songs I love on 6 CD's, it would have been worth it, as I love music. Out of 6 CD's, all the songs sound almost identical and 'do not go anywhere'. A cool intro beat and groove starts.... and then nothing! *ALL* the songs on this disc, except for two songs (which are only OK and I already have) have this decent intro, then just keep playing the into section over and over... you keep waiting for some really interesting continuation of the intro music, but it never happens! I do not recommend this compilation. To put it more clearly, I am always looking for more music to add to my J RIVERS MEDIA Computer software using lossless compression, but NONE of these songs are going to be used. Sorry, but this purchase was a complete waste for me..."
5,Marvelous Winterreise,"Matthias Goerne signs one of the most moving performances of this most moving song cycle. I grew up with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, but Goerne's voice and attention to the nuances of the text is as wonderful in their ways as is the ""master's."" Goerne is clearly one of the two or three best of the new generation. This is another feather in the cap of the Schubert series."
3,"Pleasant, but a little disappointed","I was disappointed to find this was not the actual movie soundtrack recording. Guess i should look a little closer before I press ""purchase"". Still good, just not the movie soundtrack, which in my opinion, can't be topped."
4,London Cast - Not Quite American,"At the risk of not being Politically Correct, the London cast, while not bad, is simply not as good as the American cast. It's that simple."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"Sickly, effeminate broadway adaptations of the movie soundtrack. The rendition of Hushabye Mountain is... it makes me sick thinking about it. Don't purchase if your looking for anything remotely similar to the original movie soundtrack. When in a rush, I mistakenly purchased thinking it was the original."
4,The 1 baby item I'll keep forever,"I received this calendar as a gift when my baby was born. Now I plan on buying one for every new mom. This calendar is a great way to keep track of baby's milestones and will be a wonderful keepsake. On each page, you get to add a picture of the baby. My baby is only 5 months old, but I can already see a difference in her appearance when I look back at the previous months' pictures. I like this idea alot better than baby journals that tell you when each milestone should occur. Since all babies reach key milestones at different times, there is no stress with this calendar if your baby hasn't reached a milestone yet. I highly recommend this calendar as a cute, memorable gift."
5,baby's first year calendar,Just what I wanted. I thought it would be full calender size but it is about half that size...which is fine with me. Perfect for keeping track of babies first stuff!!
2,Should have 13 months,"I love the idea of writing down special moments in my babies first year. But this one only has 12 months, so it doesn't include their first birthday in the record of their first year. The stickers aren't very inclusive but I don't use those anyway."
4,okay calendar,"Good calendar for it's price. I just wish it had a ""birth month"" page. My oldest son has a different baby calendar and it starts with ""birth month"" and then it goes through first, second, third month...This calendar starts at first month. This makes it harder to keep track of a full year if you want to make your months start on the 1st, but your child's birthday isn't until the 15th day."
3,"Nice, just a little small.","Both new in wrapping, as advertised. I didn't read the fine print carefully, so they are not ""full"" calendar size, about 8x8 instead. Should work fine for recording babies' first year though."
3,read the description...,"I still think this calendar is cute -- I just wish I'd read the description (the ""fine print"") to discover that this is not a ""standard"" sized wall calendar - it's a mini. If you want a small calendear, this is for you."
2,I wish I would have read ALL the reviews,"I wish I would have read all the reviews. The calendar is cute but the months are off. With my first son's calendar you could just place a one month, two month...sticker for each month he turned. This calendar does it for you however it doesn't work out that well. For example it starts with month one but my son doesn't actually turn a month old until the following month (obviously)- so where the calendar says month two he is actually only turning one month old. So... if you do buy this calendar be sure you write April/May, June/July and so forth to fill in your calendar. Even their picture on the back of the calendar has just a typical calendar month labeled, which means the marking of the dates was not clearly thought through by the company. This calendar is also small so you can't write a lot of info on the dates. My first son's calendar was done by Parenting Magazine and I loved it. It's called Baby's 1st Calendar: A Keepsake Calendar"
1,Buyer Beware - not enough months,I received this book as a gift. I loved it. I'm halfway through finishing it and I decided to go ahead and write out the days of the month to complete his year. I just realized that they don't offer enough calender space to ad my son's birthday month. He was born on June 17th so I started with June and I should end with June. Well the book only had 12 calenders so it ends with May! Such a disappointment. I almost want to buy a new different book so I can have room for the last month.
3,Cute but wish it had a little more room/space to write in,"I was looking for a keepsake book/calendar where I could record all of baby's firsts, journal some milestones, etc. With my first I received a free calendar from Nestle/Good Start that was awesome, but they do not have them available anymore. With this calendar, there are cute stickers and a little space for a 4x6 photo and some fill in the blanks (""I like...I don't like...I'm learning...etc.) each month. However, there just isn't enough room for me to put everything that I'd like down. The space for each of the days of the month is only about 1x1"" square, and if you put a sticker in it, then there's hardly any room at all to write anything. Also, with the Nestle calendar, it was a spiral bound that had pockets each month, which was nice. It was made more like a book, instead of a wall calendar. I could put some cards, photos, etc. in that one, whereas this one, since I don't have it hanging up, just gets stuck in a drawer."
2,Luckily I bought from Amazon,"Bought this and received it more than a week ago, used it many times, from roast turkey breasts to baking pizza to toast sliced bread for breakfast. I gave it many chances, I really wanted it to work, but at the end I gave up. Took me more than one hour to bake one pizza when I easily did the same thing in 20 minutes with my old countertop oven. Finally had enough when it cost me 10 minutes at 410 degree just to make 2 slices of toast bread warm. I figured I must have a defective product, it is either that, or all the wonderful reviews I read are bogus. I returned this product to Amazon, the only good thing about this is that I bought it from Amazon, I did not lose money, only time."
1,Not a good product!,"Ordered this product 6/20/11 and today is 12/14/2011 and it has stopped working. I should have listened to the prior reviews and not bought it, but I thought I would be an exception. I would not recommend this. It does work well the few months that it does work and then you have to buy a new one. Shame of me if I order another. No Way!"
1,Sunpentown SO-2000 Super Turbo Multi-Function Round-Shaped 12-Liter Convection Oven,I had to return this oven because it wouldn't turn on after only three uses. The switch for the timer seemed a bit flimsy. Amazon.com's return process was very simple to follow and I was refunded in a timely manner.
2,Good While It Lasted,"This was an excellent product up until it failed to work after three months. Like a previous reviewer stated, the cost associated with taking advantage of the warranty is not worth the effort. Definitely a disposable item!"
1,Sunpentown SO-2000 Super Turbo Oven,"I've purchased the SO/2000 Turbo Cooker and it's horrible. It doesn'tcook the food and I'm sorry I purchased it. It was a waste of my moneyand I would love to get my money back but I waited over the 14 days toreturn it because I was trying to give it a chance to cook my food,but it never did so I'm out $80 and regret it tremendously3/25/06i spoke to sammy at the company i bought it from he said that it would be picked up (it was) it is now about 2 month and i did not get my refund. i e-mail sammy many times and no answer back now i am calling my credit card and logging a complaint i cannot get over how this company does business ....."
5,Good Book,This is a pretty basic book and will get teh beginner into the basic very quickly. I would recommend this as a good starter book
5,Great place to start,"I use this book in conjunction with theory instruction from my teacher and it is working out well. The best part of the book is that it does not have TAB so you are forced to learn how to read music. The book can get boring, so you must stay disiplined and perhaps you could learn some cool bass riffs online to keep your interest."
4,Quality book,"Ive only just dived into this book but I like it so far. I only have two issues with it. First it mentions positioning which is poorly implemented and adds confusion. Secondly, and this is more of a personal preference, I dislike quick introduction of sharps and flats. I feel it works better when you have learned all the notes on the first frets and are very comfortable with them before working in sharps and flats. Other than that the book is a awesome."
5,Terrific Book and CD set,"This book is an excellent intro to bass playing and can even be used for upright bass. It has plently of clear practice pieces, and doesn't move ahead too fast like a lot of beginner books do. The CDs are great to practice with, and the music is pretty hip for even the first few pieces. I am really learning how to read the bass clef using this series."
2,No Tabs. No Good.,"Great book? Potentially it was. The lack of tabs (diagram of the notes on the bass) in most sections and examples totally ruins what could have been an outstanding book. The author prefers to illustrate many examples and pieces in JUST traditional musical notation. At a minimum, the author should have presented both notation and tabs and let the reader decide. Some may feel philosophically that one must learn how to read music. If that's you, fine. More power to you. It's not me. I like tabs. There is some value in the book. That's why I borrowed it from the library rather than buy it.If you desire a beginners book that does give you the option of musical notation OR tabs in many instances check out ""Bass Guitar for Dummies."" Yeah, I hate the Dummies name too. Don't let that influence you. It is very well done, comprehensive, easy to understand and comes with a CD which facilitates both learning and developing a good ear.As always...YMMV........"
5,I love Hal Leonard books,"Their books are spot on and easy to follow. If you're looking for a book to help teach you a musical instrument you have to go far and away to find something ""better""."
4,Bass Guitar Method,"Hal Leonard's Method for Bass is very good for those interested in reading music for bass, including understanding chords."
3,Good if you already have the basics,This is a very good book if you already have the basics of reading music. Gives more emphasis to playing than practicing hand/fingering technics. Not realy for a first time player.
4,It's a sunshine day...,"This story of the making ofThe Brady Bunchis great fun for fans. It starts with the auditions, then the famous wedding/pilot show (""Tiger!!""), and goes through all five seasons with the kids growing up and becoming stars.Barry Williams' memoir inspired this 2000 TV-movie, so it's no surprise that his alter-ego is the heartthrob and star of the show; his amorous longings for screen-sister Maureen McCormick play heavily in the script as does Robert Reed's distaste for the low comedy.Young Barry is played by pre-O.C.Adam Brody who is utterly charming and the only one of the actors who even remotely resembles their famous counterpart. Williams narrates the story and he and producer Sherwood Schwartz appear briefly. The movie is all sugar and spice, a sweet and innocent rememberance of a much-loved TV series. Fans of the show will love it."
3,Growing Up Brady,"I saw this movie when it aired on television and thought it was a great movie. I think it really does a justice to the book, which I read right after I saw the movie. Hopefully, the movie will be just as good as how I remembered it to be!"
4,A nice add to your Stang,This is a nice addition to any Mustang. I like the caps to go over the screws the most out of this product. This is also the best way to go then the other ones that has the black lettering that always falls off! If you live in areas that has frequent snow then you need to wash your frames often. Here in IL the salt on the roads used to melt the snow will eat away at your frames if you don't get to cleaning them soon.The nice thing about these is that not everyone driving a Mustang has frames like these so I consider it more of a special dress for your ride. Just keep them clean and they'll keep looking nice on your special pony!
5,Great gift for someone too busy to take care of themselves!,"Dr. Baietto and Jeff Baietto have taken volumes of practical self-help advice and condensed it all into 115 pages of easy to read and easy to use effective skills. Their innovative book includes charts and surveys so the ideas can be directly applied to life. I highly recommned this book to my patients who are too busy to take a month off at a resort or spa, but who are motivated to revive their energy and outlook on life.Take 15 minutes a day to change your life!"
3,A great looking reproduction,"The overall detail of these dinosaurs is fantastic. My only minor complaint is that my T-rex's legs are loose making it difficult to keep him upright. That said, he still frightens me."
1,Um no thanks - totally old school!,"This is soooooo not the first cookbook for newlyweds. Any well meaning guest who buys this for their bride and groom should really take a second to look through the recipes. Newlyweds and cooking are not a natural combination, if you know what I mean. Okay, call me crazy but if I open up a cookbook and most of the recipe titles have things I've never heard of in them, that spells trouble. The recipes are so 1980s - very foo-foo. What about healthy, quick, good food? And a little diversity in the recipes, please :)"
5,One of the best...,This is one of the best cookbooks we received when we got married. The recipies are grouped together in menus that work for different occasions. The brownie recipe makes the most decadent brownies we have ever tasted. Would recommend this to anyone who needs a starter cookbook with more original dishes than a basic cookbook!
2,Not for beginners,"If you're a true beginning cook like me, this book will overwhelm you. I'm a working newlywed and eating three hours after I get home at 7pm just isn't going to work.Some of the recipes are tempting, but overall they have lots of ingredients (some that i've never heard of or that are expensive to buy and then sit on the shelf) and take a long time to prepare/cook.If I were having the parents over for brunch one Sunday, I may get up super early to surprise them with a meal from this book, but for everyday cooking, this cookbook is a disappointment. The ""First"" part of the title is misleading.I'm looking for a BH&G type book but with modern recipes... hopefully I'll find what I'm looking for soon!"
3,"Not really a ""first"" cookbook","Pretty good recipes, but they use many ingredients, some unusual, and frankly neither my husband or I thought the results were worth the time and effort. For any couple new to cooking, buy a Better Homes and Gardens cookbook instead. We've tried a number of cookbooks, and BH&G has the most consistently easy and tasty recipes."
4,Enjoying it still....after three years of marriage.,Great cookbook for a dual chef kitchen.....fun for a married couple who like to cook and entertain together. I find the recipes to be very tasty and relatively easy to prepare on the whole. Great cookbook...great gift idea.
4,just what I was looking for.,"well packed for mail service, no UL markings on unit, right size and shape for the spot that it needs to sit in."
5,Be ye prepared,This book was in great condition. The subject was end time events. However I fear it didn't fully agree with my understanding and take on endtime prophecy as I see it from the bible.
2,Laudable concept couched in unreadable prose,"Although the values this book preaches - modesty, virtue, guarding your tongue, Christian faith - most definitely need to be taught by mothers to daughters, this book really isn't going to help. It's so full of purple prose allegories that the average teen will hurl it to the floor laughing. The first chapter in particular was a groaner. The Biblical passages offered for suggested reading are of much more practical value, and less of a trial to read through. Read the Bible together and study the many feminine examples of character and faith - Esther, Mary, Elizabeth, Rebekah, Rachel - and skip the lavender phrasing in this."
2,Book IS mediocre,"I find it shocking that a reviewer who claims to be a believer engages in such un-Christian behavior (namecalling) and slanderous stuff. I happen to know Fruit Loop and she's not only a believer, she's an ordained interfaith minister. She reviews Christian fiction such as Jan Karon and Tim LaHaye as well as Christian self-help books. Someone only checked the first three pages of her nearly six hundred reviews. This book, as she says, endorses positive virtues but is badly written. The flowery anecdotes induced only boredom and rolling eyes with my twelve-year-old. How sad that people can't simply stick to reviewing and not engage in spiteful, vindictive behavior, which is one thing this book was designed to prevent. Obviously there needs to be such training for some mothers as well."
5,A true blessing!,"Thank you to Mrs. McDonald for writing such a needed book for mothers and daughters. This book is not only enjoyable to read, but it also puts the concepts of modesty, purity, resourcefulness and homemaking into practical, easy to understand language so that our young maidens can envision themselves living in such a manner. Mrs. McDonald paints a desirable picture for our girls to imitate using Scripture as well as examples from her own family filled with maidens of virtue. A delightful read!"
3,Very Protestant!!!,"I am Russian Orthodox. I liked the book, but if you read the book on the same topic but writen by the person from eastern christian culture you would see the difference."
3,It be better if i got to listen to it,"The cd was alright, but it be better if i got to listen to any of the songs."
5,I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE EASY STYLE,I DID NOT GIVE IT A ONE STAR BUT A 5 STAR AS I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.
3,Many Faces to Many Places is an engaging and perceptive flight of fancy that offers a maturity that is welcome in this genre,"Many Faces to Many Places is an allegorical journey through...life, really. The main character is a girl named Many Faces, who has the unusual ability to converse with nature. She goes on a journey through a strange world of allegorical plentitude, where all the characters have suitably descriptive names, such as Old Man Pain and Elusive.Some readers, as well as other reviewers, have classified this volume as a children's book, but I must disagree. Whether or not it was intended to be a juvenile book, I don't know, but the surprising depth contained would, I believe, be missed by many younger readers, if only because it addresses many issues that would be foreign to them.Many Faces to Many Places is an engaging and perceptive flight of fancy that, instead of being frivolous, offers a maturity and profundity that is more than welcome in this genre."
5,Dog backpack,"Back pack for dog is really great. Has a good fit, and does not slide around when placed on dog. I have a 70 Lb. Doberman so I order the medium. Have found it better to order by weight vesus measurement. Although he has a fairly deep chest. He is very lean, so large would have been to big.Large roomy pockets can fit numerous water bottles and collapsable water dish for my dog, lighweight jacket, snacks, etc. Great buy for the money. Looked at Pet People for one and they ran about $89. Much smaller and would not carry as much. Which is ok if you don't need to carry much, but for hiking the extra space with this one is really great."
5,Dog Pack-Large Back pack for Dogs,"Both the item and the company this was purchased from, Backcountry Edge, were excellent. I made a mistake on the size and the company exchanged for the proper size with no issues."
5,"Mountainsmith Dog Pack, Heritage Red , Medium",I really like this little pack and my Labrador Retriever (~65 lbs) does not seem to mind it on her back. We have used it a number of times over the past 2 years and it is a good product that I would buy again. Be careful on the sizing. I would not want anything larger than this Medium size for my 65lb lab. I only which they would use a material that did not retain the dog hair as much as the velor fabric parts on this product does. It is also good to make her walks a little more tiring for my wife. Labs have lots of energy and a short walk (without additional weight) is not much of a physical challenge for our gurl.
2,Fair dog backpack for regular walks but...,I would not use this pack for long backpacking trips. The pack does not use a y-yolk over the shoulders and does NOT place the bulk of the weight over the dogs shoulders. I have to say I'm taking my Mountainsmith bag to a seamstress to convert the chest harness to a y-yolk and bring the bag more forward to put more weight over the front shoulders.Dog owners with dogs who have long backs or a breed who have a tendency to get hip dysplasia later in life should NOT consider this backpack.Mountainsmith should be ashamed for selling a product like this that increases the likelihood of causing lasting harm to dogs.
4,Well made pack,"This pack is well made, but be aware that the red coverings on the straps are not pads - just covers. I purchased this pack over others because I believed this one had better cushioning on the straps. I am still pretty happy with this item and will make better covers myself. The capacity of this pack is small, but is sufficient for the weight my size of dog should carry. The rain coverings over the zippers are a nice touch, as is the lashing strap on the top of the pack."
4,"Great pack, lots of room","Pack is designed really well, only issues I'm having are that the pack itself can be painful when my dog is bumping into my legs. That's more a problem with my dog than the pack which is why I gave it 4 stars."
5,Beautiful backpack,"Very sturdy, handsome pack. My dog acts much better when she wears this pack. She is a working sheep dog and can be a little unruly when I try to civilize her, like walking calmly down a city street. But the pack makes her think she is still working and she takes great pride in having it on."
2,Won't stay on right,"I have a 75 lb lab and love to take her hiking with me. This pack just doesn't fit right and always ends up leaning to one side or the other. As well, it rubbed on the backs of her front legs so much that she had blisters there. Waste of money."
5,"Great product, Great service",I will gladly do business with these folks again anytime. They didn't have my product in stock so they automatically upgraded me to the next backpack and gave it to me at the lower one's price. This doesn't rub my dog raw in any spots and i run her very hard with it on. It is constructed nicely and is made of durable material. The customer service from them was excellent.
3,not for long hikes,"I would not use this pack for long backpacking trips. The pack does not use a y-yolk over the shoulders and does NOT place the bulk of the weight over the dogs shoulders. I do like the accessories (waterbowl, food bowl, thermal mat, and leash). However, I have to say I'm taking my Mountainsmith bag to a seamstress to convert the chest harness to a y-yolk and bring the bag more forward to put more weight over the front shoulders.Dog owners with dogs who have long backs or a breed who have a tendency to get hip dysplasia later in life should NOT consider this backpack.Mountainsmith should be ashamed for selling a product like this that increases the likelihood of causing lasting harm to dogs."
4,"Not the best of the best, but we certainl have no complaints","After trying and testing several pack for our three dogs (all rather large), we found this to be the best of the bunch or the price. Do be careful of the sizing though, as the recommended poundage is a bit off. We found that down sizing the pack size fit our dog perfectly. The last thing you need in one of these packs is slippage. This one holds a great amount of gear, hold up well and the dogs do not seem to mind it one they throw their normal tantrum."

5,"What a Powerful, Thought-Provoking Book","I have read all of Cheri Huber's books, after discovering her book ""There is Nothing Wrong with You"" at the Crazy Wisdom book store in Ann Arbor, MI.This book has helped me tremendously in becoming more aware of my ego and how it runs/affects my life, and gives you practical ways to find peace. A must-read for anyone on a spiritual path searching for a way to be peaceful in our insane world."
1,Typeface Warning,"I could not even read this book. I think that they used a Lucida or a Mistral typeface and it was so distracting that I had to return the book!The contents might have been good but who'd know? Why in the world they would use this typeface, I have no idea."
5,Australian Jazz Quartet,"I have this album in vinyl that I bought when it came out way back when. I was hoping to get it on CD, and am so dissapointed that it is no longer available. If you happen to get your hands on a copy, hold on to it. It is one of the finest jazz albums I have ever heard."
5,Probability From the Front Door: Information Theory,"If you want an introduction to information theory, and, in a way, probability theory from the real front door, this is it. A clearly written book, very intuititive, explains things, such as the Monty Hall problem in a few lines. I will make it a prerequite before more technical great books, such as Cover and Thompson."
2,Steer clear of this one,"I had the misfortune of having to buy this book for a night course I took for personal interest. As a an engineering professional, I found the ideas of having a customer throughout architecture, design, test completely impractical. Other impracticalities include assessing usuability by hiring an expert in cognitive behavior.I had hoped the book contained information that would help with the practical design of gadgets and/or GUI interfaces. No examples of good and bad, what the public in general wants, how this is affected by demographics, etc.This book contains hardly and only a small amount of technical, non-subjective material.The book is also not gender neutral and uses ""she"" often when they refer to a non-specific user/person, which got on my nerves!"
2,Even my tutor did not like this book.,I am currently studying CS at university and one of my classes in HCI. All I can say about this book is that even the tutor for the class hated this book - as did all the students - so much so that the next semesters' book is going to be something else.
5,Beverly Hills Diet buddy wanted :),If anyone is interested in doing this program with me for the 5 weeks let me know. We could e-mail eachother daily for encouragement and support (something I could really use). I had hoped to use the web-site for this but it seems to be down.
2,Great if you follow the diet only once!,"The book is well written and encourages you from day to day to follow the diet. I lost 12 pounds in the 35 day span. I have a warning, though, for readers who wish to continue following the diet. Because of the vast amount of fruit on the plan, I developed a bad anal fissure that has lasted for 6 months. The pain is immeasurable, and I am facing the possibility of surgery. I would recommend following it only for one 35 day span, and continue afterwards with a greater emphasis on vegetables and fiber. (i.e. from bran.)"
3,"Its a quick, fad diet. No worse than SLIM FAST!!!!!!!","I have read the book, I understand its contents of how enzymes work with enzymes. I don't think its all that bad. If you only want to loose 10 or 15lbs. After you loose the weight desired you could then go to a well balanced food plan and healthy exercise schedule. However, if you intend to continue eating like this then I can see how it could be dangerous to your health. One can not eat like this for long. Society is so hell bent on being slim. It drives us nuts. Thats partially why there is a product called SLIM FAST on the market. You must use caution on any diet. I think that fruits are a great way to loose the extra weight you want in a quick fashion. YOU control your OWN mind. DONT blame it on anyone else."
1,A Horrible Diet,"The author's dietary plan begins with going several days eating nothing but fruit. Apparently, the idea is to lose weight by inducing a severe case of diarrhea. Another brilliant idea of hers is to avoid exercise; wouldn't want to put a few pounds of muscle on that ghastly figure. The author looks like a victim of her own bad ideas. Judy Mazel is obviously an idiot, but shame on the irresponsible publisher who dumped this garbage on a gullible public. There are a lot of very bad diet books around. This one may be the worst."
3,Mixed feelings about The Beverly Hills Diet,"The Beverly Hills Diet by Judy Mazel, gives a great deal of insight into food, enzymes and how to maximize the ""power of the pineapple""! I first tried this diet in the summer of 1982, and lost thirty pounds, keeping twenty off for over 10 years. The problem was that I couldn't stay on the diet for more than 8 or 9 days at a time before becoming violently ill. Ms. Mazel's idea of using fruits to compensate for bad eating days, as encouraged in this book, has stuck with me over the years, and I use it to this day. The diet is updated and far healthier in her New Beverly Hills Diet book, but having read and tried both, I can tell you the results are not as instantly gratifying in the new version."
5,Thanks Judy!,"Both my mom and I lost 20 pounds the first time we did this diet. I was never hungry and I love her idea that ""nothing is leaving the planet"". I feel healthy and have a lot of energy. I have been giving this book to my friends for presents. I like the day by day pep talk. It helps to learn slowly the proper way to eat. A lot of diets do not teach you how to eat after you lose your weight. Judy talks constantly about maintenance and prepares you for when you finish the diet. Thanks Judy!"
3,Caution: No Singers,"Fascinating premise, but all you get here are various orchestral excerpts from the operas listed. I took a chance (since the cover is so unhelpful about the actual contents of the discs) but came up short. Some interesting performances, but if you're looking for singers, you'll have to find them somewhere else."
5,Adictive!,I'm starting to know these books of by heart. They are all brilliant! We started with Slinky Malinki but have happily moved to Hairy Maclary via Scarface Claw! My daughters both love these (3 and 5) books and recommend all of them - especially rumpus at the vet! Superb!
5,Beautiful and Inspirational,"Every time I re-do a room or make a home decor purchase these days, I'm looking for things to make my house look more Mexican. This book, and its companion volume ""Traditional Mexican Style Interiors"" are wonderful reference books for anyone looking to copy that style.If you're just a fan of Mexican style, or have been to Mexico and want to have a way to go back without leaving your easy chair, this book is fun to read and magnificent to look at. Although it emphasizes exteriors (facades, architecture, etc.) there are photos of gardens, courtyards, and plenty of other spaces that you could create on your own property, even on a very modest budget, and without knocking the house down and starting over."
2,Interesting read,"Why was it interesting? It was interesting to me in the suspension of belief sort of thing. But the anthropology was hard to follow and more than I cared to follow about west african mojo. Jane's journal was very personal in an unpleasant out-of-her-mind way. The olo, ifa, ulene stuff was over-detailed and forced me to work too hard to decipher the plot in all of it. The author's expression of Jane's mind was unsettling and the racism of the book was too guilt-ridden. It was a little scary when Witt would ""come"" for her - that's a good thing. But in the end I was disappointed that the entire story was just about the magic and suspension of western beliefs. Certainly an intelligent writer, and intelligence appreciated. But this book was not my cup of tea."
5,Lots of Voodoo Fun,"Fun mystery thriller. Nice new twist on a supernatural serial killer. Made the African Santeria beliefs seem almost credible. A audio book ""page turner"". Five stars because of the good writing, fast pace, and the how well the author handle African mystacism more than because the book a masterpiece."
2,meh.,"not that great. pretty well written, but ""thought provoking""? Not really. Literary thriller? Not to me. Too much silly action in the end, and I had to suspend my belief a whole heck of a lot."
3,"Suspenseful, Entertaining, but Verbose","This book has it's moments that keep you on the edge. The characters do feel real and are like-able. There is humor and there is terror nicely stitched together. I found Jane's journals tiring, though, and the flowery detail too unnecessarily time-consuming. I was slightly disappointed with the ending, but the book overall is a good read."
5,Better than Silence of the Lambs meets Serpent and the Rainbow? Definitely.,"Another Gruber book that I just couldn't stop reading. Tropic of Night is an original, expectation-defying thriller tinged with dark - yet scientific - mysticism. Think Serpent and the Rainbow meets Silence of the Lambs. Having just read Gruber's recent ""Book of Air and Shadows"", I was expecting this book to be less mature - but I was completely mistaken. He juggles multiple stories, points of view, and tenses with ease. The story, the characters, and the writing are all first-rate and hard to forget, and there several bone-chilling scenes. (I felt that I needed a glossary to keep track of some of the African terms, and realized there was one - as I turned the last page of the book. It's at the end.)"
4,Scariest book I've read in a long time.,"Without going into the plot here, plenty of other reviews have done so, Tropic of Night is one of the most suspenseful and frightening books I've read in a long time. The logical and clear way the world of sorcery is brought alive here places the book firmly in the fringes of the ""real"" world, and tears down the protective barrier that keeps us safe from most fantastic fiction.Through out the course of reading this book I found myself constantly looking over my shoulder in crowded places and jumping at every shadow and noise when home alone.I though the ending came too quick and neat, the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.I recommend it for anyone who wants a gripping suspense and anyone who needs to be jarred from their ""reality."""
4,Delicious,"I don't like thrillers. I get annoyed by mystery writing that involves exotic poisons and religions. I abhor violence. Intricate plots bore me. And I loved this book. I loved it because I loved the mind of the main character, the way she thinks and expresses her thoughts. I love the inner and outer worlds that this novel travels, and among the geographical locations I especially enjoyed reading about the different Miami subcultures - I'm not American and had no previous familiarity - and was deeply fascinated by the description of an imagined hidden African village, untouched by anything un-African. Above all else, this book is intelligent fiction, and with all the hack writing and hack politics and hell, hack living that's just rampant these days, what a refreshing change."
5,Irresistably seductive,"The three converging story lines in this highly suspenseful novel compellingly draw the reader from his or her own reality into the depths of the supernatural (or is it vice versa?). Either way, the suspense is nerve-wracking, as ancient forces collide in modern day Miami. There is much to be learned, by both the reader and the protagonists, as this book draws to a spectacular conclusion.Here is an important piece of advice that the author neglects to mention: there is a highly useful glossary at the end of the novel...after I discovered it halfway through, I found it invaluable."
1,Took a Left Turn For the Worse,"I slogged through the first 50 pages confused and not really seeing what direction this book was going. Then thouroughly enjoyed the next 300 pages thinking I'd just discovered a great new writer with an interesting recurring character, Dectective Jimmy Paz of the Miami PD. But in the last 100 pages the author took such a drastic left turn that it ruined the book. Gruber took an extraordinary amount of time steeping each character in realism by doing so much research on his topic that you really believed the the characters. But then he chucks the whole thing with an absurd ending that starts way too early. The final 100 pages are not based in reality making them just plain stupid. And for that reason this book deserves to be panned."
2,Someone wake me when it's over!,"I tried really hard to hang with this book and hoped that it would improve, and maybe it does, but I've got to tell you folks, this is one of the most boring books I have read in a while. I forced myself to read to page 150, and just couldn't take it anymore, life is short and shouldn't be wasted reading books you are not enjoying. There were faint moments of excitement and mayhem, but it was a lot like reading a VCR manual for spiritualism. There were a ton of terms and vocabulary to learn in order to understand what was happening, and at least the part I read was so vague, you had a hard time deciphering what was taking place in the story.I had heard this author was great and decided to give him a try, but if all his books are this disjointed and boring, I think I'll pass, thank you."
2,Compelling but boring at the same time,"Ok, this is a clever story, and I cared what happened to the characters. But the intense detail about the actual witchcraft bogged down the interesting parts. The book would make me want to keep going, and then I'd hit a wall, either because it was Jane Doe's over-detailed, and frankly not very interesting, journals, or several pages straight of Jane's every action in preparing for a ritual. At times I'm thinking, wow, this is a compelling book, and the next minute, I'd put it down and go to bed, because it was so tedious. My theory? This needed a good editor to kindly tell the author, great story, but cut out the parts that are unnecessary and only seem like the author's showing off of his knowledge."
1,What's All The Hype About?,"I was so looking forward to reading this book. But it's just a kind of uneasy mixture of at least two different books and maybe three. I think the author was trying to come up with something different, but grinding one book on top of another and hoping it'll all work out is not the way to go about it. Add a lot of gratuitous violence and no real attention paid to character and you've got a book that's all sound and no substance."
2,not as good as the hype,"This was overhyped to me -- it's not bad, just not that great. I found myself skipping over many parts, and finished it with little feeling. There are much better writers out there doing the same thing."
1,Would have given it zero if possible,"I must not have read the same book as everyone else. Either that or I just completely missed the boat.I could not even bring myself to finish this tiresome, tedious book. I tried so hard to find a way to care what happened but just couldn't do it. Jane Doe is the perfect name for the ""heroine"". Drivel, drivel, drivel characterizes her every appearance in this novel. Jimmy Paz has potential but alas it goes unrealized.I didn't even bother to bring the book back from vacation. I only hope some unsuspecting soul doesn't pick it up."
1,The book is overhyped,"I didnt/couldn't finish this book. I found it tried too hard and while I don't mind violence, this violence is there for its own sake."
1,What's with all of the fragmented sentences?,"The story seemed to have a good plot, but I found it very difficult reading because of all of the incomplete, fragmented sentences. As far as grammar goes, this is one of the poorest works I have ever seen.A fragmented sentence is OK to use once in a while, but Michael Gruber uses them excessively, especially when detailing Jane Doe's thoughts and actions. I counted 35 fragmented sentences on one page.Trying to figure out what Jane Doe was thinking was like trying to translate with someone who has a limited understanding of the English language, and making sense out of fragmented gibberish.This book may as well have been written in Pig Latin. It would have been easier to read."
1,Probably the worst and most ridiculous books I've EVER read!,"Unfortunately I wasted much too much time reading this book to the very end. I kept thinking it HAD to get better but it never did. In my opinion, there are absolutely NO redeeming features about this book . The only reason I'm taking the time to write this brief review is to prevent others from wasting THEIR time reading it."
5,"An intense, gripping, literary thriller","Phew! I just finished Tropic of Night and found it absolutely unique and-- pardon the pun-- spellbinding. I should have started this book on a Friday, because while I was reading I didn't want to do anything else-- like go to work, eat meals, or sleep.I can't imagine why anyone would call this book overhyped. It's imaginative, well-written, and terrifying. I can't wait to read the next book Mr. Gruber writes, and I hope that he is planning a series of books about Jane Doe!"
5,One heck of a first novel!,"I couldn't agree more with the Amazon reviewer who wrote that this book blows the over-rated ""DaVinci Code"" out of the water. This is the kind of mystery-thriller we all hunger for, perfect for crawling into bed with on a stormy night or reading on the beach, yet remaining intelligent, challenging and provocative. I kept flipping back to the author Michael Gruber's bio in the back, dumfounded that this was his first novel.Not since ""The Possession of Joel Delaney"" has a book delved so deeply into pagan voodoo ingratiating its way into modern society. And there are other, more humanistic undercurrents, about the difference between love and possesiveness that will keep you thinking long after you've put the book down.Don't be thrown by the tacky, cheap-thriller cover. ""Tropic of Night"" is a total winner that you're very likely to read more than once."
5,Audacious indeed!,"I love the reviewer who gave this book only one star and used the word ""audacious"" negatively. If you don't know how to read in the first place, please don't write reviews of books.That's besides the point! Tropic of Night is quite ingenius. The cover art really is unfortunate, as it makes it seem like a run-of-the-mill pulp thriller, when it is more thriller meets sociological masterwork (an intertwining of the nature of magic, perception and racism).Buy and read this book immediately. And to the reviewer who thought this was only his first novel, a correction: It is popularly known that Gruber actually wrote the majority of Robert K. Tanenbaum's Ciampi-Karp legal thrillers (about fifteen of them I think), almost all of which are extremely good."
3,Not really worth it,"I bought this thinking it would be as good as the ""What to Expect..."" book, only specifically taylored for someone carrying twins. Not so. It is set up so that the authors are interviewing parents of twins about specific issues. These issues are not even medically related (what I was personally looking for), but rather how to deal with being pregnant with twins or raising twins. If you're looking for support from other parents of twins and their opinions, this may be your book. I, however, was expecting something very different when I read the review."
2,Twins! Expert Advice from two practicing physicians on pregn,"I bought this book for my daughter, who, having a tragic miscarriage several months ago, just found out she was pregnant with twins. We all were so incredibly happy, so my husband and I went right out to get her some books about twins. I started skimming the book on the way home. My first reaction was how much ""gloom and doom"" was in this book. Maybe with our first experience with the miscarriage, we were ultra sensitive to risks and uncertainty, but I for one found all the negative information very unsettling. I gave the book to my daughter just the same so she could judge it for herself. The beginning was extremely scientific and hard to wade through. To make a long story short, my daughter gave me the book back and asked me to return it to the bookstore, which I did. (...)"
2,Fraternal Twin focused,"I have been somewhat happy with this book; however, it really focuses on Fraternal Twins as opposed to Identical Twins. Hoping the author will read this before they offer an update- one of the most important topics for identical twin mothers to be is on Twin to twin transfusion. Although two pages are noted in the information, only one is accurate and it is just a listing of a place that offers information/assistance for this syndrome. The first chapter also begins by saying there are four identifiers of identical twins and then never continues to out line or discuss these four things. I have found some info good, but these two other issues, make me wonder what else is missing. I am only 4 months into my pregnancy so I am sure I will find something else within this book that lacks complete information. Sorry to give a bad review- that wasn't my hope when I made the purchase. Hope this helps others!"
1,Nothing different from side notes on twins in conventional pregnancy books,"Given that caring for twins is expensive, I felt that this book wasn't a good investment for me. It did not give me any information that wasn't already in the side notes on twins/multiples in ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and the information on pregnancy in general was better presented in ""What to Expect When You're Expecting."" I was disappointed that there was not more information on cesarean births and birth plans. The ""interviews"" at the end of each chapter presented as fake to me and seemed to be added just to fill space since there wasn't enough specialized information to make the book thick enough."
4,good book,I'm a mother of toddler and am expecting twins. Twin pregnancy is very different from a singleton. This book was very helpful in giving me a starting point of what to expect. I recommend it to any parent of twins.
5,Useful for first-timers!,"I really appreciated this book on pregnancy with twins. As a first-time mother, I wanted to know not only how my pregnancy could go week-by-week, but how it differed from a singleton pregnancy. This book was great for this. While it did not go week-by-week, it went by every few weeks of new development. The chapters were informative and included pictures and ""things-to-expect."" They also included situations that may come up and offered good explanations of this.My husband also enjoyed this book because of the discussions they held from parents of twins at the end of each section. He enjoyed that the dad's were involved in the discussion as well. A lot of books do not offer much towards first-time fathers, so he liked that they were included.I would recommend this book for first-timers. It's great to pick up at any given point in your pregnancy when you are asking yourself- ""is this a normal symptom?"" The book reassured me and rested my worries."
2,Generic; not very helpful,"I didn't much care for this book. I found it to be a compilation of all the generic advice found in the non-multiples books. For example, the recommendations on weight gain tell you how much to gain by trimester, while the Barbara Luke book recommends weight gain by week according to starting BMI. I was also frustrated on several occasions to read what I felt were opinionated statement later on in the book about what not to do during an earlier stage (for example, I remember something along the lines of ""whatever you do, don't announce your twin pregnancy before week 13"" far along in the book, rather than early on- not only is this the author's strong opinion, it also came a bit late if you didn't do as they recommend)."
3,Good Read,I am not sure if there is any good book out there to prepare you for twins but if I had to choose one of the 3 books I picked I would choose this one as the best. It had lots of good info that I needed before I had the twins but after the twins came I found that What to Expect the 1st year was the best.
4,"Not the best, but better than most","I still haven't found the ""best"" twin pregnancy book -- I think a ""What to Expect Twin"" guide would be the best -- but this was definately one of the better ones. The conversations were completely boring and this could use some additional illustrations in my option, but the book was a lot better than some of the others."
4,"Comprehensive, positive look at what to expect with twins","My impression of this book differs so significantly from that of the other reviewer on this site that I can't believe we read the same book! I felt that this book, while it did not explore any one aspect of twins in-depth, gave an excellent overview of pregnancy, delivery and the first year (as the title would imply). I, too, read the Elizabeth Noble book referred to by the other reviewer and would not recommend it to anyone. The author is too hard-lined about issues such as breastfeeding, drug-free, vaginal deliveries, and diet. ""Twins!"" is much more middle-of-the-road and takes a look at all options with little bias. This allows the reader to make her own decisions about these issues without pressure or guilt. This book is certainly not all-inclusive and I would encourage expectant parents to read anything and everything they can find on the subject of multiples. However, ""Twins!"" is a great place to start."
3,Use as a 2nd Source of Info Only,"I am so glad that I didn't buy this book as my sole means of sussing out important twin information. Informative, yes, but there were many points left out & a lot of silly little sections of parent conversations that could have been easily excluded. I also found that I was able to skim & the skip the whole first section of the book because while interesting to some, I didn't have the time or the need to read in detail about how twins come to be. You'd think if you were having twins, you'd already know that from that initial conversation with your doctor, right? Overall, it was nice to have a book just on twins, but the singleton books seem to have a lot more of the basics."
3,Could have used more information,"I purchased this book after reading ""raving"" customer reviews here at Amazon. The reviews made the book sound teriffic and full of info. The reviews compared it to ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"". I found it lacking in solid information. Lots of general, blanket-like info on carrying twins. Each chapter had a discussion from the authors, parents, & doctors, printed and I found them useless. This may be a good book for first-time parents, but I needed more information to satisfy me."
4,great info,Great information on natural remedies without having to take medication. Has a lot of remedies for everyday problems
4,Cheaper alternative to the Apple branded cable,"I lost my iPod cable a long time ago, and I've been casually looking for a replacement. This cable fit the bill, as it does everything the overpriced Apple one does. Sure it looks cheap, but this will probably only get a few uses and go right back into my cable drawer."
1,iPhone USB cable,"This cable worked for a week and after that it stopped working, also it says that it's a 6 feet but the one I got was only 4 feet long."
5,Works great!,"This is a darn good cable for the cost. If you are a die hard Apple Fan you may want to get an Apple branded cable but if you are looking for a good cable for cheap, this is it!Casey Schultheis"
3,maud martha book review,"contents of book fine. advertised as ""like new""; that was not the case. condition was good, except there was a sticky residue on cover of book, as well a a large inventory sticker on the back cover of the book, which if removed would have torn the cover. as the wise man said, ""caveat emptor""."
5,Works Great,This charger works perfect with my V60i Motorola. I won't get rid of my phone because it is the best phone I've ever had for finding and holding signal.
3,works good...as home unit,"I just got the Inno today and I must say it is a neat little device and works great when plugged into the home base unit. However, as a portable unit, I get little to no reception. I am going to purchase the antenna headphones in hopes they help. Otherwise I just spend $124 and $6.99/month for something I could access for free on-line with my current XM subscription! Also want to point out, I LOVE the headphones that come with the Inno, I will use them with my ipod for sure!!!"
4,What I expected from Pioneer,"Great product for my wife, from our daughter, on mother's day. An avid walker she loves the download features, both from XM and mp3 type.The only draw back is the battery cover. It falls off easily. Other than that I highly recommend this for anyone who likes music on the go."
2,Inno - Bad Reception,"I am very disappointed in this product. I bought it so I could listen to XM radio while running but the reception is terrible. I live in a major city where my built in XM car radio works great. It may be the antennae but for whatever reason, the reception drops out completely for minutes at a time. I would not recommend it. My other beef with Amazon is that since this product came from a third party vendor, and they have a very strict return policy, I cannot return it. So now I'm left with a device that does not work properly and I can't return it."
2,mixed bag,"I had been telling friends about this watch and the great deal I got on Amazon. While I remain a big fan of Amazon, I no longer trust this handsome watch. The problem is that every once in a while, it will lose a half hour or even an hour. This has happened three times in the space of about six weeks. The result is that I cannot depend on it to tell me the correct time if I am not in a position to verify that it is the correct time. I wonder if this is the genuine item or is perhaps counterfeit. Don't waste your money. As a result of this experience, I reluctantly bought a big-screen TV locally a few days ago. The hassle of returning poorly performing merchanise to an online vendor is a problem.Update: I continue to use the watch but last evening and this morning it lost 2 hours, which it hadn't done in a while. I can't recommend this watch, even though it is great looking.Further Update: Over the last 18 months it has not lost any additional time. Go figure."
2,Sentimental Avant,"With thesaurus in left hand and rhyming dictionary in right, TH's tin lyrics combine the mordant whelp of teenager's diary with 90 year old Dada techniques--collage, juxtaposition, idiomatic tagging--with none of the boulevardier charm. Most of the book is just dross, harmless and forgettable--what rankles is the author's highfallutin' attitude--he thinks we skipped that Experimental Poetry class."
3,"Useful, but not very.","Although this book provides tips for writing questions in very accessible language, any novice to survey or questionnaire research is going to finish the volume with many unanswered questions. Patten is very good at helping the reader learn about question writing, but her chapters on sampling and pilot testing barely scratch the surface. I would recommend this book for an undergraduate, but certainly not for the serious graduate student who wants to conduct high quality survey research."
2,Weak mystery and a so-so political novel.,"It is indeed unfortunate that Gov. Weld has already quit his day job. I doubt that his future lies in writing novels.There was never much doubt about who the murderer was, just as there was little doubt about the outcome of the political races.While I have visited Boston several times, I don't feel qualified to comment on the political stereotypes in the novel past the point of saying that if true, Boston is still in the 19th century. If the novel is accurate about politics in Massachusetts, I cannot see how Gov. Weld was ever elected."
2,Fishy,"I found this book in the bargain bin at a super market. I figured that I'd be hard pressed to not get my money's worth on a 50-cent investment. Yet, sure enough, I put down ""MACKEREL BY MOONLIGHT"" after about 40 pages. I like politics and I like mysteries, so this book, by the interesting former governor of Massachusetts, seemed like a safe bet. Instead, Weld packs within those 40 pages every politically useful (for Weld) character trait he can apply to his lead character, including wholesome affiliations with people of just about every identifiable demographic group in, well, in Massachusetts. Maybe there's a story here beneath the propaganda, but I didn't wait around to find out. You shouldn't either.I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because in fairness I didn't finish the book and I guess it could possibly get better."
1,Very heavy mug.,"These are very heavy, thick walled cups. If you are expecting the classic thin walled lightweight Corelle then you don't want these. Very heavy mugs."
3,More Great DDR Music,"Soundtrack for DDR 4th Mix.Disc 1: 90 second game versions of songs.Disc 2: Megamix of all songs from DDR 4th MixCompared to the 3rd Mix Megamix this one is poor. Little mixing is actually done and it's just one song after the other. 3rd mix portrayed a bit more effort with their Megamix.Overall, 4th mix has some cool hits, but not as many as other mixes in my opinion.Enjoy!"
3,Too large and a bit heavy for students to throw about,"With great excitement my students use 2""x2""x2"" foam dice as a random classmate selector for the next math question and to generate random values.These 6"" molded poly dice are made of heavier foam making them too heavy to toss about the classroom. Additionally, the surface captures a lot of classroom dust as I roll them on the floor. To thwart this dust collection a bit by spraying them with 3M's Scotch Guard's protector.A bit pricy for the quality. Photo a bit different from actual product."
3,sweet story,this was a very sweet story. i'm sorry but i just never felt emotionally attached to the characters. i read the words but somehow could not get any feelings out of them.
4,"humour, mystery, romance and highly sensual","Courtesy of A Romance ReviewFascination is the first book of Ms. Cameron's Rossmara Quartet with Charmed, Bride, Beloved and The Wish Club following in the series. It is a book with a bit of everything - humour, mystery, romance and highly sensual. A delightful and highly recommended read."
2,Great movies - - Lousy Transfer.,I find it extremely hard to believe that in this day and age with all the technical expertise for restorations of classics no one bothered to restore these to their pristine condition. C'mon people!!! How tough is it to get a good master copy or at least dust off the one you are using. One thing about DVD. It sure shows off all the dust and dirt and white fibers.Also it is apparent that the scenery is always changing colors throughout the movies; like the copy they used was sitting in the trunk of a car in the desert for a couple of years before they found it for this collection. Holy smokes. If they can restore old Charlie Chaplin dissolving nitrite films to pristine condition why not these???!!!! I am disappointed that these classics that we grew up with and loved have been so poorly prepared and transfered to dvd. I love the movies. I hate the condition.
1,Terrible customer service,The seller sent it to the wrong address and when it was returned to them they kept my shipping fee and never sent out the product to the correct address. My daughter was expecting this before christmas and was extremeley disappointed. This was by far the worst customer service i have ever received. It was also unethical to keep my shipping fee as well. I would recommend never doing business with this retailer.
1,It never arrived!!!,I probably might have liked it but it never arrived and I was told it was out of stock when I complained. However it was in stock when I ordered. So I'm not happy.
5,Better than I had remembered,"I was beyond pleased with the Christmas collection!! I have a small son and he loves it. It was better than getting the movies all separate, it is easier to keep track of, and it comes in a very neat DVD case that looks like a book. But the quality was wonderful and it brought back great memories. It was nice to see Santa Clause is Coming to Town in with Rudolph and Frosty bringing all the classic's home in one set!!"
5,Wonderful,"These are all the old Christmas specials from years ago. The bonus is that they are full length shows. The one for Kris Kringle was an hour long, so there's a lot you don't see on the 30 minute TV show with commercials. I'm glad I bought them."
2,The 2005 Releases Have Been Altered!,"I just want to let everyone know that the versions that they are selling this year (2005) of this set look exactly the same as least year's (2004) but have been altered! Some special content has been cut! Rankin's introductions are among the cuts. True, these intros were horribly corny and he failed miserably at trying to be intellectually profound in them but still it was part of the set's charm! Also, there are advertisements at the beginning of the discs now that can't be skipped!!!! If you're going to buy this set (which is otherwise great) do yourself a favor, go to ebay and buy a copy of last year's release. You can recognize it because it's packaged with a Rudolph figure.The alterations are the only reason I rated this so low."
4,Great Movies... Horrible CD,"Now dont get me wrong, the ONLY reason to buy this DVD set is because of the classic Christmas shows... and on that end this is an excellent collection! HOWEVER! Whats the deal with the horrendous CD enclosed...when I saw a Christmas CD was included I excitedly bought the DVD and opened it in my car to listen to some christmas classics... put to my horror I hear the classics torn apart by some horrible singer (and his wife!) I cant imagine its that hard to put the show versions or at least decent songs on a CD... but other than that its a great DVD"
5,Love these recordings,I grew up with these recordings and love to relive these old classics. The Original Television Christmas Classics (Rudolph the Red-Nosed...
4,Christmas Package,If you're looking for the old time Christmas Package this is the one.. it has all the oldies plus more. There are hours of entertainment here and fun for kids of all ages. I enjoyed these!
5,great great great!,this dvd collection is great and wonderful. its really worth it's price. its great to watch together with the family around the fire with the christmas spirit.
3,Gregory Stone - a genealogy book,The book is very detailed and has lots of English family history in it. I did not realize it would only follow males lines and the female children of Gregory Stone would be ignored. I was disappointed in that respect and wasted my $50.00.
2,Fluff,"I picked up this book because of other good recommendations. While it is a quick and easy read, I did not find enough substance to make it exciting. The stories shared are universal and will appeal to many readers, but there are no conclusions that are not obvious. I wanted to hear more about what the lessons she learned from her experiences and observations as well as applications for the future. I did not want to hear that instead of shopping I could ""color in a coloring book with crayons"". Instead tell me that I should figure out that I don't want the shoes because they are not recognition, support, or love, they are just shoes."
1,Dumbing down America,"Reading this book after having met the author, I was quickly convinced that America was doomed to continue plodding along a path of utter stupidity. A multitude of ten cent messages and hack phrases about banal themes left me thinking international children drawn to the book's cover would soon find the content, if that is the right word for the words glued to the soft spine, the disappointing Made-In-America fluff feeding a generation of ""don't worry, be happy"", cartooned existence. Please demand better of your children; be a wise shopper: don't buy this, or, if you have already, buy that complimentary good: a box of matches. This book leaves all children behind."
3,Lightweight Mystery (even for Mrs. Jeffries),"I usually enjoy the books in the series because they are so light and so delightful. I also enjoy the characters. The characters are here and they are still quite wonderful, but the story this time is really not much at all. A man who has swindled some prominent English businessmen winds up dead in the Thames. The list of suspects is fairly short, and it's easy to figure out who did it, but oh well - we still are charmed by Mrs. Jeffries and her band of amateur detectives."
2,not a good choice for kids,"For those of you who use the box to help with puzzles, the bottom right is obscured and also it seems like about an inch all around is missing as the photo is not all inclusive. To make matters worse, the pieces seem to fit evenly and are very oddly shaped so several times we thought things were fitting and they later turned out to be incorrect. Pieces can seem to fit simultaneously in several spots. Very poor fit. There is no picture that comes with the puzzle to use; only the box which does not include everything.There are so many colors on the puzzle and we literally put something together that is not even on the photo on the box. My 10yo who got this as a gift is probably going to get through it but it is frustrating and a very unfortunate poor quality.They should have included an photo inside and made the pieces clearly fit or not! Some of them do not stay together either."
4,A good casual listen,"I'm a big fan of bluegrass and the Shins. I happened upon this album from an unlimited music subscription, and had to take a listen.I found this album a refreshing and fun retake on some of the Shin's work. The musicianship is excellent, and the instrumental arrangement is also great. The vocals are overproduced and over-corrected (almost robotic sounding), but you can actually make out some of the lyrics.So don't throw away your Shins albums, but this one is worth the time."
4,Good new twist on old favorites,"obviously if you like the shins and a little bluegrass here and there, this is the album for you."
2,Pay a litle more and you will be happier,"Yes, they are very cheap, but if you use an over-sized glass very often, as we do, it won't fit in the coaster because of it's high rim. Also, the glue wears off of the cork pretty fast. This set of coasters ended up being pretty useless for us."
3,"Does what I want it to, wish they were a little sturdier.","I wanted some cork coasters that weren't just cork since cork by itself can be broken or crumble easily.I would have preferred the acrylic to be a little thicker since they're a bit on the flimsy side.The image provided really don't relay this fact. Not a great value for the price, but they do the job."
5,"classic, hypnotic","I first heard of Urchin on an internet radio station. the song was ""candlelight"". I immediatly searched my local record shop for the album. finally after a week of searching and another week of waiting for my special order to arrive, I heard the rest of the album. I think the cd was in my player for a month straight! I play it when I throw parties for background music and find people asking me ""who is this?"". I don't want to drag on and write a redundant review, all I wanna say is this album is far and away the best ""chill out"" album ever! Find it and love it....."
3,Strings and beats trip-hop,"I've no idea who Urchin is, except for the names Jez and Nic in the credits. A shame, because the duo has a bead on how to make compelling trip-hop (instrumental hip-hop, if you like). Their formula is simple, deep string loops, midtempo beats and breaks, distorted scratches, and the occasional sample.Sounds like nothing you haven't heard before, and that's true, but they've pretty good at it. Take the opening ""Candlelight,"" which draws you in with it's swooning strings, swirling scratches, and sample ""I need the tools- the weapon's in my mind."" Or ""Texas Yellow,"" with a weeping violin and somber chorus to contrast the beats. ""Unspoken"" is a ride through dusk in the Wild West, and ""Texas Mellow"" is a darker trek through similar territory.At ten tracks though, the formula gets stale. Halfway through the album, you've essentially heard it all. This has some hits, but Urchin needs to add more in the mix to take that next step up. B-"
3,"Great illustrations, ok story","While I really did enjoy the illustrations in this book, the book itself was just ""ok"" in my opinion. I'm typically pretty generous with compliments and I've always enjoyed Candlewick Press books, I do think their quality has decreased over the past few years. It's not a bad book at all. It is an entertaining book. It is also what I'd call a ""fluff"" book - fun, attractive to kids, but most likely not destined to be a classic in 50 years.Sonya"
4,And here's to this book!,"A fun read aloud - some of the words are tricky to string together, so read closely. The message is simple - unity and respect to all the living world.Here's to the readers! The readers - the word people, the book people, the late into the night, non-asleep people!"
1,Garbage,"I bought this crap on a half whim/half single basis. I thought ""when you sleep"" was pretty good, so I decided to give the rest of the album a shot. First of all, ""when you sleep"" is very misleading. The entire album is much more mellow and sounds nothing like it, and had I known it was weird british crap, I would have passed anyway. Think Keane, but much MUCH worse. Not possible? I thought so, but I was wrong. There isn't anything rock or anthemic about it, its just badly produced brit-pop with annoyingly slow tempos. With this being the second awful CD I've purchased on a whim in the last month, I think it's time to take a break. Thanks Long-view, thanks alot. AVOID!"
4,"Excellent CD, but little variety...","I bought this album on a wing and a prayer, following hearing 'Further' on Q TV, and becoming instantly addicted to the mellow guitaring and vocaling, strongly remeniscent of songs such as Iris (Goo Goo Dolls).They do not disappoint in length - it is a sufficiently long CD with some brilliant tracks. Many brilliant tracks in fact!Ones especially worthy of note are:Further (10/10) - A truely superb track, I can't get it out of my headCan't Explain (10) - Another truely brilliant track with a very nice acoustic guitar openingElectricity - My personal favourite. The mellow vocals combine brilliantly with the haunting instruments.My only true critism of this album is the lack of ambition in the singer's vocal range. He has a lovely haunting voice, but often it sounds ocassionally monotonous, which leads to some of the songs sounding 'samey'Nevertheless, a brilliant album to buy and listen to."
3,a little TOO sweet,"I knew it was going to be sweet but this is almost borderline a women's fragrance. Smells like a vanilla talcum powder, almost. Not very masculine, but it doesn't smell horrible."
1,Don't be fooled! Fake!,"So it seemed just great to be able to save 5-10 bucks on a bottle of le male. Well it's too good to be true. It's completely fake. I'm sure. For some reason I ignored the other people reviewing this that said it was fake. I wish I had just bought it somewhere else and got real cologne. Don't make the same mistake I did. Le male is the most faked cologne in the world! Of course amazon is going to scam you!(other details)I bought the 2.5 oz bottle from amazon.Drawbacks of fake cologne are huge. Little to no projection, smell lasts an hour or two max, after about 15 minutes the smell isn't the same as le male. And many more."
2,Arrived damaged and product has leaked all over the package.,The spray valve arrived off the bottle and is damaged. This will probably prevent me from using what product is left. I would recommend one buy this product from a brick and morar store...not online.
2,Not great,Not saying this isn't for someone.....just not for me.....I will not buy cologne online again unless I am familiar with product.....live and learn
5,Great Buy,"Ive been using JPG for few years now and I love it. I wanted to change it up and few months ago bought Chanel de Blue, but it just didnt match up and i had to get JPG again. Def order from amazon, much cheaper than macy's which i believe is about $115 bucks."
2,Hit or miss,"This is the second time I bought Le Male. It's absolutely amazing... if you get the original one. The first time I got it, I was very satisfied. The scent lasted for the entire day. It's amazing and it's the only one I wear for winter time. However, I got a completely diluted version for my second purchase. It was diluted with lots of alcohol. I know this because it smelled like alcohol just after spraying. The true scent comes out after a while. It's good but I would have to use more for the scent to last all day."
5,perfecto,"it got here (venezuela) today, it's safe and beautiful, perfect for a gift for valentines day.. just on time! thanks"
1,Amazon would not let me return this,For the product itself it has a great fragrants. But it was delivered to me damaged. The can smelled of the fragrants and liguid was seeping out so I knew inside was broken. I did not open it because of returning it. Amazon conciders this a hazardous product and will not let me return it. Now how am I suppose to get a refund of of 48.00. There is no phone number to call or email.. Anyone have any suggestions.Thank you
2,Printed on tissue thin paper,I bought this book for a course and while turning the pages ripped several. The quality of this $60 book is not worth the money. I have seen thicker toilet paper. I was not impressed. The author should find another publisher who won't rip him off.
4,Good book for HLS classes,I needed the book for Homeland Security classes. It was required reading but was interesting and provided a source of reference for my writings.
3,Needs a little improvement,"This percolator is ok, but two things could have made it great...-markings on the side showing number of cups-a wooden or other material handle (as opposed to the stainless) would have made for not so hot handling."
5,Doesn't feel cheap....,"Out of the box it feels heavy duty, I was worried about it having that ""cheap"" feel. I have to say I haven't perked any coffee in it yet, but I must say this thing feel legit. I bought this strictly for camping and I am willing to bet based on its build and feel it's going to be the last one I ever have to buy. I highly recommend this perk (disregarding I haven't brewed a batch yet). I am going camping this weekend will write and update. The only thing I don't like is the lid. It has a tapered end so you have to push fairly hard to snap the lid on. My last perk the lid was easy to put on. I love the glass top unlike others who don't."
4,MY NEW POT,JUST RECEIVED MY POT YESTERDAY. BEING USED TO USE MEASURED COFFEE POTS IM HAVING TROUBLE WITH MEASUREMENTS. HOW MUCH WATER TO COFFEE GRINDS. ALSO ORDERED SEPARATE GLASS DOME WITH POT. HOW EVER THE DOME IS BEING SHIPPED SEPARATELY SO FOR $1.99 DOME THEIR CHARGING ME $8.95 SHIPPING!!!!!!!
5,Better coffee,Coffee has a better taste. You can smell the coffee through out the house.Purchased for home use but you can use camping or were ever
1,Tyipical 'Made In China' Junk,"I bought this percolator to replace an aluminum WWII era percolator, that still works excellent, because I wanted to move away from cooking with aluminum. The actual weight of the pot and lid is nice, however, the interior parts are quite flimsy. I even had to bend a piece back into shape before I could use the pot for the first time. The stainless basket is nice but the lid to the basket doesn't fit tight in the basket and you end up with a lot of grinds in the coffee. On my old aluminum percolator the basket lid actually snaps tight into the basket. This is a typical Corporate American profit squeezing product. I don't expect it to last very long at all and will get used to flossing the grinds out of my teeth."
3,Good Heavy Pot - a few problems,"I ordered this for my dad as he loves the ""old"" percolator style coffee makers. I chose this one because of reviews and because it was a Coleman.Within a week of use the glass ""top"" cracked (my dad believes from heat) which was very disappointing. Also, any buyers need to remember this pot is also for camping so the handle is metal and will get hot unlike others made only for the stove top. This coffee pot is heavy and a bit too much for my father but I guess if you drink a lot of coffee in a given period this one might be for you. Overall I owuld not recommend purchasing this perculator."
2,You have to brew at least 8 cups to get decent coffee,"I had a Corningware percolator that broke. The handle melted off. Apparently, these were recalled 40 years ago for that very reason. Who knew? But it made the best coffee ever. So I knew I wanted another percolator. I chose this one because it was heavy gauge steel with a glass top. No aluminum (alzheimer's contributor) or plastic (taste wrecker), so I bought it. It doesn't build enough steam, heat, pressure or whatever magic makes a percolator work properly to brew a decent cup of coffee unless you want to brew a minimum of 8 cups of coffee, and even that isn't good. I am still shopping. If you would like to buy a used Coleman 12-cup percolator, just let me know."
5,Great Coffee Pot,Wonderful coffee pot! Heavy duty stainless steel and quality contruction. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good cup of coffee.
4,GLASS KNOB PROBLEM,"I LOVE THE STAINLESS STEEL CONSTRUCTION, BUT IN THE FIRST WEEK OF USE, (AT HOME ON AN ELECTRIC RANGE), THE GLASS KNOB SEPARATED AT THE THREADS.WE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON GLASS BEING IN THE COFFEE, SO WE DUMPED THE ENTIRE CONTENTS AND STARTED SEARCHING FOR A REPLACEMENT KNOB.AFTER SEARCHING THE WEB, AND READING MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM, ON THIS SAME COFFEE MAKER, I DECIDED TO ORDER 4 NEW KNOBS FROM COLEMAN,(I WAS NOT CONVENCED THE FITS-ALL KNOBS OFFERED BY OTHERS WOULD WORK).IT SEAMS THAT THE KNOBS ARE NOT HEAT RESISTANT,(LIKE PYREX), AND ARE SUBJECT TO THIS PROBLEM.IT'S HARD TO FIND A STOVE TOP PERCOLATOR MADE OF STAINLESS STEEL THESE DAYS, AND OUTSIDE THE PROBLEM WITH THE KNOB, I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PERCOLATOR TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A COFFEE POT TO LAST A LIFETIME.PS: KNOB #2 HAS BEEN IN SERVICE FOR 6 WEEKS WITH NO PROBLEMS, BUT I KEEP IT LOOSE IN THE TOPS THREADS."
3,Can not get replacement parts...,"Very well made. However, do not lose any of the parts (coffee basket, basket assembly etc) because Coleman has stopped carrying replacements! Lost the lid to this coffee maker's basket (that holds the coffee) while camping, can't find a new one anywhere...Give this only 3 stars because of the parts problem. $30 plus percolator rendered inop due to missing $2 part? Coleman sucks"
2,Good quality stainless coffee pot,I found diffuclty making smaller amounts of coffee. Water boiled away before perking less than 6 cups. Took a long time to perk quality coffee.
3,Experimenting Required,"I bought this percolators because many, many years ago it always seemed that percolators brewed good coffee and I was tired of getting a new drip coffee makers that may last a while or may break right away or may make good coffee or make poor coffee.This percolator makes good coffee but it took quite a bit of experimenting: how much coffee / how much water / how long to leave on the stove.... Coleman did not make it easy to figure out all the parameters --- the percolators that I used many years ago had lines marking both the suggested levels for coffee grounds and water for various number of cups of brew. The Coleman had no markings. If the Coleman did have markings, I would give it 5 stars. I have had it for several months now and have not had a problem with the glass dome like so many others have reported."
5,Lovely Percolator,"I got the Coleman 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Percolator because I wanted something beautiful, with no plastic parts. I've been using it for a couple of months now with no problems. It's very sturdy and nice enough to look at that I just keep it on the stove all the time. (Perfect for my teensy no-counter-space kitchen!)I do have an extra glass dome on hand, but I haven't had to use it. Based on other reviews I keep the glass dome screwed in loosely, and I don't use it to remove the lid."
2,A Loss in the Hyperion Edition,This recording can't possibly compete with Ameling's earlier performance with Dalton Baldwin on Phillips Classics. It totally lacks the luster that Ameling grasped in earlier years. The Hyperion version of her is not among the great gems of the Collection.
4,Great Resource!,"As a middle school theatre teacher, it is often hard to find suitable scenes for my students. This book, however, offered a few nice scenes for them to do. Yes, much of the material in this book is way over their heads, but there are still charming scenes I know my students really enjoyed from plays such as: ""Heidi,"" ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and ""West Side Story."" Not the ultimate book for middle school, but I'm sure excellent for high school students."
2,Perforation Claim,"We have used this product and this size for 30+ years. Have been generally pleased until about three years ago. They went from perforation to creasing their pages, making it almost impossible to remove the sheets. Sore finger tips and using pliers to remove the wire spiral are common. We are looking for another supplier."
1,Great but FAR too expensive,"Hard size to find, so it's nice that Amazon has these, but the same product retails for about $2.45 through other sellers here AND at other online retailers. So look around and don't get ripped off. For example, see same product sold here by ""Restockit""."
5,Youthful Voice,"This is an early Bostridge recording, and his youthful voice is a good match for this light-hearted song cycle. A charming disc, one you'll return to repeatedly."
3,Disappointment,"Don't get me wrong - this is a good record. I love Bostridges voice, and his Schuman and Schubert records on EMI are 5 star records (so is his Britten too) but here he sounds too immature. Not only his voice, but the whole interpretation. Hope he'll make a second attempt on the work rather soon, for now I stick to DF-D."
4,Well built and a good value for the money.,"I purchased two of these Turkey feeders. I purchased without reading the fine print -- by looking at the picture of the feeder, so I was a bit surprised when they showed up without the barrels. I went back and read the description and it said that the barrels needed to be purchased separately -- makes sense when you consider the shipping costs would be more than the barrels.I bought the barrels for $10 apiece, so still a good value. Units came will all the parts and good instructions. I strongly suggest securing feeders in the field with guy wires because unit is top heavynwith feed in it. Anyway, one in the field it didn't take Long for the turkeys to discover the free food. I'm pleased."
2,Saddles and comfort is not in the mind of the beholder!,"Well I fell for the hype and paid the price.After a year, I still find this saddle to be uncomfortable for any lengthy riding. The springs do not seem to help at all. I need al the support I can get. On good days I will ride 12 -15 miles with at least 3 -4 days a week Had to cut back from daily riding. I spent extra money on my new road bike with alterations in the handle bars and post. I have about $2000 into this last bike I will ever buy.I have chronic lower back and neck problems. I need comfort, comfort and more comfort with my saddle.I switched back to my two saddles that are contoured and shaped for ""men's: needs. One is less than $50 and the other, the one I fine most comfortable to ride on is about $20.I followed instructions to the letter and consulted with local and other Brooks Saddle experts and long-time users.Oh well, win some lose some.Planning to give it to a former student of mine. Maybe."
1,SCROTUM DESTROYER,"The tip of the saddle has a bolt beneath it in order to adjust the tautness of the leather, unfortunately for me it was in a horrible position because after returning to my seat from rising for a bump the HARD metal bolt jammed against my peritoneum causing a feeling of being electrically shocked and this happened twice on the same ride. The next few days my entire scrotum was numb. Highly recommend the selle italia prolink saddle...."
5,Book was in excellent condition,"This was my daughter's favorite book as a child - the library no longer has it so I got it for her as a gift. Even though the dust cover was missing, the binding and pages were like they were brand new. She loves her book."
1,just a piece of GARBAGE,"Nice and beautiful design, but the quality is very bad. With only some weeks of use, the band changed its color, gold parts turned black. Is difficult to trust that is a Pierre Cardin product. It's wasted money."
1,DON'T BUY THIS WATCH!!!!,"I probably shouldn't have expected much for the price, but the product description is simply a lie. The watch movement (made in Japan) is fine. The case and band (made in China) were described as being made of stainless steel which they are not. In 15 months the case has peeled and corroded, and the band has turned black with corrosion and fallen apart 3 times with the most ordinary of daily use. One end was pinned to the case with an ordinary piece of wire (ran out of case pins that day?). Nice work, Pierre. Just trash."
1,Discolored within 1 month,The watch was beautiful when i bought it. But the color faded away within 1 month of usage. very bad product.
4,Great Watch,The watch was quite a bargain. It was a gift for my father who loved it. It was stylish enough to wear out in the evening yet sporty and comfortable enough to wear everyday.
5,Raimon A l'Olympia,"This is a beautiful 2-CD set. It has Raimon's landmark song, Al Vent, and many other beautiful songs which brought back memories of altres temps. It's difficult to put these CDs away as the melodies and Raimon's voice stay with you."
1,These people promote evil,"My name is Caeser Pink. The makers of this video are guilty of illigal use of of video footage owned by my band, which is featured on the DVD.The makers of this video believe that all people who belong to any other religion are evil satan worshippers. I believe religious intolerance is an evil force in the world and is responsibe for terroists acts such as 9/11. We need to teach people to respect each others beliefs system if the world is ever to live in peace.People who promote the philosophy that Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, wiccans, and other religions are satanic are the true evil in our society. But rejoice, because my lawyers will soon have this DVD off the market."
1,Christians can't spell,"Anyone who is offended by rock music is mentally unstable. More interesting would be a government-funded study into how out-dated religions can have adverse affects on today's society by contaminating the minds of children with silly stories about plagues, floods and some old man creating the world in seven days. Rock music is the solution, Christianity is the problem"
2,The Perfect Gift,This film is the perfect gift for kids who have been or will be going to Jesus Camp (a film worth seeing) and their parents who believe FOX news is the Gospel Truth!
4,freedom of speech and religion,"After reading some of the reviews of this movie I am amused. Freedom of speech and religion are our rights. Anyone offended by this movie is certainly entitled to their opinion, just as those who enjoyed the movie and found it to reflect their own views. I found the movie extremely interesting. Understanding diversity comes through exploration and deciding what is right for you. I was not offended and I would recommend this movie. Anyone secure in their own beliefs will take the content accordingly. If you are unsure of your beliefs, you may be threatened or enlightened. Either way I am pleased to see it on the market. I support freedom of speech and religion."
5,A great resource for preachers and teachers,Hell's Bells:The Dangers of Rock 'N'Roll is a great resource for all of those who wish to expose the evils of today's pop culture. Pastors and Sunday School teachers should watch this at least once to get a good understanding of the music young people listen to. Eric Holmberg shows what and who is behind rock music.Hell's Bells: The Dangers of Rock n Roll (Original Classic)is a must have resource for all of those who have friends and family in this rock culture.
1,oh you have got to be kidding,"If you are seriously rational person you could flip this around and look at all the subliminal messages in religion.This movie was made during an era when Tippa Gore was trying to charge heavy metal bands with 'ruining the youth' and inciting suicidal tendencies (great band BTW) or devil worship.Rock n roll focusses on celebrating what it is to be human now and for the future...with religion, the future is behind us.Rock n roll worship is fundamentally no different from religious worship.As Jimi Hendrix once said 'knowledge speaks, wisdom listens'.Dont bother with this pile of junk unless you live in the midwest of america and have no hope left of understanding this complex world in rationales other than within judeo christian belief systems."
5,Everyone should watch this,Most people have no idea about the spiritual battle we are in every day. or the influence music has on us. please prayerfully consider watching this video
4,High Comedy!,"I saw this video years ago in a Christian youth group. It was hilarious! Goes to show that some people lose their sense of irony and humor when they go to church too much. A classic hysteria video in the same vein as ""Reefer Madness."""
4,Nice watch,Received it in the mail today. I had a perpetual calendar watch that was very heavy. This one is a lot lighter and smaller and it looks really nice. I needed a battery for the perpetual calendar Seiko and was told that I had to send it back to the factory to get one put in. What a joke. They told me it would cost $80 for a new battery. Wish I would have known that before I bought it. Well this one seems alright for now. Time will tell. :-)
5,Vital Apologetical Understanding of Reason,"Becker provided a vital and interesting investigation into Luther's concept of reason. What is so useful is finding out about Luther's use of reason as magesterial vs. ministerial.Being educated and catechized in the medieval theology Luther knew the center as Reason around philosophy, which still dominates RC theology (see Ratzinger's ""Principles of Catholic Theology).Many misinterpret and thus misuse and abuse Luther and his theological offspring by taking him out of context concerning Reason and Christianity. Becker's book is antidote to this."
4,From A Life Aquatic,"If you like Seu Jorge's David Bowie covers from the film A Life Aquatic, then I'm sure you'll like this album... Great modern day Brazilian music."
4,Get your hands on this somehow....,"First off, ""Carolina"" is a really cool, fresh sound.If you're like me, you came to find Seu Jorge on the Life Aquatic movie. Life Aquatic featured him in a slower, stripped-down acoustic format.""Carolina"", however, features upbeat, moving, happy songs. Lots of very danceable songs. He has such a great voice that you forget that it's all sung in Portuguese.If you search around hard enough, you can probably find it somewhere else cheaper though. It's worth the import price though.It's definitely highly recommended for fans of samba, world music, and just different/unique/cool music in general."
1,many sections illegible,"This is a scanned version of an original book. Many sections toward the beginning are illegible. Maybe I was just unlucky, but many pages of my copy are not usable. It gets better toward the end, but still was very disappointing overall."
3,A reasonable first effort; here's hoping for more,"I'm a fan of Robert Asprin (have read all of the Myth book and both of the Phule books), but I was never much interested in the Theives World saga that he edited. The few stories I managed to read seemed less than satisfactory.This, though, is far more satisfactory. There are some obvious rough edges that need to be smoothed out before I'll say that Evans & Asprin are really a team, but they have a lot going for them already."
3,I liked it but...,"it was not the ""Myth"" series. Well written, but I read it coming off the ""Myth"" series, so my expectations were on a different line. I will go back and read it again with a different frame of mind when I get the time."
5,Pretty darn good...,"Anything by Robert Asprin is worth reading, and this book is a side of his work different than anything else of his I've read. While the style of the writing is a little stilted and sometimes sounds very unedited and choppy, his world comes through to the reader. And a neat world it is, too.The characters and situations and even the location it's set against make you just sit back with a silly grin on your face--you really don't know why. There's nothing spectacular about his writing, but Asprin brings his usual sense of humor to a well-researched and lifelike background, and the combination is wonderful. The plot and locations leave this series open to so many stories, and I can only hope that Asprin will be the one to write them."
2,Doesn't get interesting till nearly end of book,"I'm a big fan of time travel scifi. This one is just not one of them. It takes way too long to set up, with long drawn out descriptions of surroundings and the education of the young main character. You'll be down to the last 5 chapters before things actually start to happen. At several points I almost decided to quit reading it and start something else. I kept on only because I hate to read more than half a book and not completing it. If you want to get into the meat of a book no later than the 3rd chapter, this book is not it."
3,A Lukewarm Effort,"""Time Scout"" revists the theme of time traveling explorers and tourists coping with the inherent hazards of taking jaunts to the past. Such a premise has already been deftly explored by Poul Anderson in his ""Time Patrol"" series and Robert Silverberg in his novel ""Time Gate."" Asprin's effort, however, falls somewhat short. While he creates a plausible and somewhat intriguing society, his main characters are one-dimensional and obnoxious (especially Margo, who is an annoying brat). While the narrative is fast-paced and mildly interesting, it ultimately never captivates us. A decent novel, nothing more..."
2,"Has it's own charm, but...","These are not a full or typical tarot deck. stories relate to different ideas like ""no-mind"", ""non-attachment"",etc. the stories are nice and are illuminating reminders, and some of the cards are beautiful in their simplicity, but i don't think these cards can compare to the other set of osho tarot cards, which are strikingly beautiful and insightful. i would recommend the other osho tarot deck."
2,Serious Omissions - not for beginners,"What was the smiling author, Elisabeth Smith, thinking, when she wrote this book? It makes absolutely no sense at all, to publish a foreign language book that does not clearly show the correct pronunciations associated with the words.A beginner will have no clue as to how to correctly pronounce these words in french. And pronunciation is extremely important.....in ANY foreign language. This book (along with many others) are poorly written, rush-to-market paperbacks.The real ""Teach Yourself"" series are very well written and will always have a ""ty"" in the upper left corner of the cover. All the rest are a waste of time.I studied French in high school and college, so I'll use this book. But for the true beginner, buyer beware."
5,One of my desert island CD.,"Songs here are so charming that almost at the first hearing you are completely lured. They reflect the many facets of schubert's feeling about night, from safety homey, grandeur and splendid, to mystery and obscure, cold or warmth. Johnson's tone is just like the night---both laggish, seductive and mysterious. His interpretation ""Die Sterne"",""Alinde"",""Des Fischers Liebesglueck"", ""Vor meiner Wiege"" are very compelling and moving. An Excellent CD.One of my desert island choice."
3,Okay but....,"This is probably more useful to others than for me, but if you have the space, it's a nice accessory to have. If you have delicate items to clamp, this works well."
1,broke on 2nd use,"useless,used it to clamp a plastic water gun and the grip screw snapped....very disappointed in this item,will throw away...buy swiss next time."

4,A great vice for my Dremel tool,I bought this vice right after I bought a new Dremel tool and flex-shaft. The base is pretty well made it feels sturdy and hold the tool when I use the flex-shaft. Since it is easy to move around and attach to different places I also find myself using it when soldering boards and components.I little too much plastic in its construction but as I said before it seems well enough made for its intended purpose.
4,Very Handy,"This multi-position vice is really a benefit when you need a third hand. I have used mine many times. I would rate it with 5 stars except for the two gripping parts which hold the material steady are made of a strong plastic. Ordinarily that is OK except when the materials you are working on heat up and leave an impression on the two grips. Obviously, the fix for this is do not continue working on the material when it gets too hot. A better fix would be for Dremel to include a metal gripping surface that is insulated from the plastic grip so heat will not be transferred to other plastic parts of the vise. People who have used Dremels appreciate this because they know the high speeds of the Dremel can cause a lot of heat rather quickly. While I find this to be a fault, it is one that you can work around."
4,Excellent design but overpriced because it is made of plastic,I am an RC aircraft builder/hobbyist and I consider Dremel to be the best hobby tools and attachment accessories available.I have many attachments for my Dremel tools and they are excellent for light duty hobby/craft work.I really love the design of the vise in which it is somewhat versatile and easy to use for a lot of jobs butnot too good for others like clamping parts to be soldered.IMHO for the price the units could be made of materials more stronger and heat resistant than plasticfor example aluminum could be used. aluminum can withstand more pressure and give the multi vise moreclamping power for a stronger grip than plastic can and would better reflect the the current asking price for the plastic unit.Just one persons opinion.
2,"OK for the money, but I'd look elsewhere.","This vise does work, but not well enough to be of good value, but then being a machinist maybe I'm too hard to please. The plastic acme screw thread is not smooth and difficult to operate even after I lubricated it and the clamping faces don't line-up consistently. It's pretty much all plastic and I guess your getting your moneys worth, BUT....... a good vise is a priceless thing to have........... like good friends."
3,This is a fully plastic vice,This is not for heavy duty stuff but the fact that it has an attachment for a rotary tool makes it kind-of worth it. If you need a stationary Dremel rotary tool or work with electronics this is a good vice. I would recommend a metal vice for other toolwork and soldering.Plus points: the clamp has a big opening and the vice has a long range so it will easily attach to a desk with in my case a row of thin drawers. The head is also round so it allows for a full 360 degree horizontal and almost 180 degree vertical movement of the clamped subject.Min points: It feels plasticy and I am afraid of tightening stuff too tight or moving the head around without loosening as it may come apart or crack.
3,Ok but not great,Seems a bit flimsy. Large size for what it does. Awkward to change out the vise arms.
5,An Inspiration for all Men,"This is an outstanding book, and it bring great inspiration to all that are striving for success."
4,New Liberalism,"This study showed a new liberalism that developed at the begining of the American Republic.Ms.Applby shows how the Jeffersonian Republicans rejected the old""country party"" ideology of their English ancestors and developed a more libertarian and socially liberal view of society.She shows how the Republicans rejected the old ideas of order,deference,and class that shaped colonial society.She also points out how the Jeffesonians rejection of mercantilism began an ""american"" ideal of free trade,low taxes and sufferage for the common man.The study points out how the Jeffersonians combining of diverse elements:merchants,tradesmen,and wealthy plantation owners were bound not by an egalitarian ideal of equality,by by an ideal of equality of opportunity within the new american nation.Overall an excellent study."
3,I'ts okay,"The book was physically in good condition, however there was a lot of highlighting in it. Other than that, it was good."
3,"If you are serious about harp playing, buy a more reliable set","I am not truly a harmonica player, I just mostly use them for Zeppelin tunes, but I know what a decent harp sounds and feels like. But of course I know you get what you pay for too. For the price, they aren't bad, but if you are a seasoned professional, you'll want something a little sturdier. A good harp has that heavy, solid feel to it. This set is very light and fragile. Couldn't really bend a not that far, and I'd say if you dropped one, you'd easily damage the reed and wouldn't be able to play all the notes.So I am on the fence about this set. If you are a beginner and want to have a full set, go for it. For the money, it's not gonna matter if they don't sound the best. But once you start honing your craft, you'll want to invest in some solid, reliable, nice sounding harmonicas before you hit the stage."
3,Not Bad: A Whole Set For The Price of One Decent Harmonica,"I saw I could get a dozen harmonicas with a case. Heck, I thought; the case alone is probably worth that, so I ordered the set. I own a half-dozen Hohners but needed some different keys. I didn't expect much in the way of quality, & I was right. When playing unplugged with my acoustic guitar, they have less volume & sound quality as the Hohners, although their sound is acceptable. But when playing through my PA system, I can crank up the volume on the mic & they're OK. Reed bending isn't difficult. All in all, the harmonicas are decent beginner/intermediate instruments that allow me to complement my Hohner collection, and I can always put my Hohners in the nice case. For the casual harmonica player, recommended."
3,Harmonica Review,This was good value for the money. The case is a little funky and don't think it will last long (zipper mechanism). The harmonica's were good starter items.
4,Good enough for me.,"I play most songs on the guitar tuned a half step down, so I wanted a full set of harps to be sure I could play along with my guitar. These work fine. I use a brace to hold the harmonicas while playing and I find the sound good and I don't worry about bending notes because you can't bend notes in a brace."
3,Not too pleased,"These harmonicas are very cheap plastic, with passable sound quality. I ordered them as a gift and was reluctant to give them except as a beginner's set. They will do for play, but nothing serious, as they are just cheaply constructed. I should have realized that from the price, though. For what I paid, I suppose I can't complain too much."
4,Johnson BK-520-set,The Johnson blues harmonica set for the money is a good buy.I don't have to have 40 dollars a harp tied up on differant keys that i don't need often.
1,Poor sound quality,"The case and presentation is very nice, but the sound quality of these harmonicas is very weak. There is a poor joint between holes and top/bottom plates so lots of air is bypassed. They feel very light weight in your hands. Compared to a Honer Special 20 these seemed like they had half the volume. You get what you pay for."
1,Lots of Harmonica but lostof lost quality,I received the Harmonicas and the best part about them was the case. They lacked sound volume and appear to be plastic reeds. I do not recommend this set to anyone who enjoys playing harmonicas.
1,these were all out of tune,"i was so thrilled to find an affordable harmonica set, yet unfortunately they were all out of tune. they don't sound that bad, but they're useless to me since i can't play them with my guitar."
4,"it's not the Hunger, people","This product is meant to be viewed in the company of at least three friends, two pizzas, half a case of beer, and an unspecified quantity of a Schedule I herbal narcotic -- preferably as part of an evening of frivolous entertainment and reckless stupidity and possibly even as a break between long sessions of video- or role playing gaming. Used properly, satisfied customers will be left with goofy smiles, hairy palms, and the warm glowing aftermath of a comforting shower of geeky in-jokes and ridiculous hyperbole. However, intentional misuse of this product may result in boredom, confusion, and sexual frustration.It's a non-studio spoof of a geeky TV show with a four-figure budget. To quote another reviewer, if you liked Airplane and the Naked Gun, you'll probably enjoy Cherub, but don't ask it to be anything it's not."
2,"cherub,..... the waste of time..","people, unles you like slapstick silliness? don't bother. if you like the police acedemy movies, or the naked gun, or airplane comedy movies, then this MIGHT be for you.please be wary though, this really badly produced bit of cinema will bore you out of your boobs. not lying here. BORING!! was realy hoping it'd be funny. sadly..not for me it weren't.so buy at your own risk."
3,It's ok,"It's a little vague on the actual math behind the statistics, and without understanding the underlying math, I don't think you can actually interpret the stats strongly. If you're coming from a social science background or are weak in statistics, it is a good book, very easy to read."
1,Not As Packaging & Description Stated,"I have used Sylvia's ""Coarse"" Grind Pepper in the past & loved it - really spicy & flavorful. That is not what this product is even though the bottle packaging clearly states ""Coarse"" grind and the Amazon description says it is ""Coarse"" Grind Pepper as well. What I received is a finely ground pepper that tastes no different than any cheap brand pepper you can get at your local grocery store. I should have listened to one of the other reviews that stated they received a finely ground pepper too. I feel like a complete idiot for purchasing (12) bottles of this and paying almost $20 for pepper that tastes no different than the Walmart store brand pepper."
3,I prefer Sylvia's coarser black pepper to this fine one.,I was disappointed with this FINE black pepper because Sylvia's coarser one had a significantly higher pepper flavor. This one is bland. It almost just disapppears on whatever food you put it on. I have to use about a teaspoon on each chicken breast just to get that peppery taste. I will be buying the coarser black pepper but not this one. It's like it was ground up too fine and left to lose it's flavor into the air before being bottled. I have to use so much of it during each meal just to get some peppery flavor that the case I purchased is almost gone already. That's not at all cost effective. Give Sylvia's Coarse ground black pepper a try...that's tasty but forget this one.
4,Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide,"I found this to be the most useful and comprehensive single volume dictionary of the many I own. Clear, easy to use, helpful with guidance on usage, it is a manageable-sized volume. I go to the New Shorter Oxford or Webster's Second (a classic) for hard to find definitions, but this answers most questions for me. It is much better than the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. I recommend it without reservation."
2,Not an ESL (learner's) dictionary,"I thought it would be the American version of the Oxford's Advanced Learner's Dictionary. It is not. Dry definitions with few examples. A native speaker may find it more useful. There are interesting comparisons of words with similar meanings sprinkled here and there. Pictures are outdated. To my great disappointment does not use IPA. It covers a large number of words, but few phrasal verbs. L**gman has a better Advanced American Leaner's Dictionary - now with CD."
1,Waste of Money,"I am a professor of English language and have lots of dictionaries. But this one just flabbergasted me with its gaps and vague explanations. Some tables that are offered online and here at Amazon, are NOT JUST THERE. I would not give JUST ONE STAR to the item! I want everyone to stay away from this book and get the Webster Dictionary. Webster has everything and it reads as a fiction book or the World Almanac, but this Oxford Dictionary has no thumb index, the illustrations are of the cave age and many, many other disadvantages that will make you feel sorry and angry because you lost money the very minute you pressed the purchase button."
4,"An interesting, well written book","I enjoyed this book very much. Although long and detailed, I found its style engaging and well organized. It's an easy read. Being able to turn dense historical material into such an interesting book is a triumph.Writing a biography of a controversial personality like MacArthur is challenging and, overall, I think Perret has done a good job. It's too easy to fall in love with your subject and the author is able to resist the temptation to hurruh too much.I think, however, that there are a few areas, where the author seems to accept behaviors that are questionable and problematic. Into his assertion of MacArthur's greatness he never really factors in MacArthur's overly emotional temperament nor his lack of veracity. There is space for further debate here that I think the author missed."
5,Listening Righ Now !!,Beautiful voice - beautiful music - I am loving Ms. Mouskouri's beautiful rendition of many favorites and others I have never heard.
5,Dry Heat,"David Mapstone and his wife Lindsay are a delightful pair of crime solvers: David because he really doesn't want to be but can't refuse the order of the Sheriff to work a long-dead case, and Lindsay because her life is in serious jeopardy if they don't solve the case soon. It's also great to read about a couple that are not romanticized but are definitely committed to each other.The reason these books are so appealing is that the author Jon Talton makes such wonderful, insightful and downright derogatory comments about Phoenix that are SO true! It is a city without a soul. Talton's style is clean, clear, and the plots are complex enough to keep the reader going."
4,some history with your action,"A pleasing hero. Not superman. But a thinking man, aware of the past and what was lost. Someone to look for again."
3,A good mystery...when it got started.,"POINT OF DARKNESS had a good premise and actually got going after about the first four or five chapters. Sam Dean is handed a letter to give to his wayward daughter from her dying father, and as part of a promise, he tries to find her. Last know location is New York City. From there, it goes fast, then slow, then a meeting with some intriquing characters, then Sam is having sex with a lady who has a blood tie with him, then the search continues, then he meets another woman he will sleep with, then the search continues. This is the tone of the novel. Well, at some point, he actually finds her, and from there, the book kick into high gear, but look how much I had to go thru to get there. I've fought off colds with less time. The ending was good and all plot thread were tied up nice and neat, however, I don't think I will be reading another Sam Dean mystery anytime soon."
4,Andy is back,"I really liked this book. One reason is that Andy is in it and so is Annie Perault (I think that is how you spell it). It was not expected or anything. Monica is brought into the series as well. Why I didn't give it a five star is because the plot got weak after a while. I mean neo-nazis in Paris, and that freakish tourguide. A little farfectched, but still a delighful book."
4,A refreshing change of pace.,Unique vampire tale has Revolutionary War era blood drinking doctor coming back to life as a vampire some two hundred years later and trying to adjust to a new world and a new way of life. Recommended.
4,Useful.,Very useful these are. I put loads of books in them and they did not even give way. Very good for when you need to get rid of a lot of things in your house.
5,Culture Clash,"Tony Hillerman THE GHOSTWAY is a vivid exposition of the clash between the modern world and the inherent culture of the Navajos. Jim Chee is caught in the war for his soul as all of his instincts draw him to become a ""singer"" and his heart has fallen for a white school teacher.The third of the Jim Chee series contains a classic example of the use of backstory to tell the new story and move the character forward in growth.The story is a simple murder mystery, but the undercurrents are a strong narrative of a people at the crossroads.An excellent read.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."
4,Essential,"What's not to like? If you have multiple effects pedals (and who doesn't?), you need a product like this. Or you could keep them in a sack..."
5,Sweat Schubert,"I believe it isn't necessary for me to describe again what big and important contribution that graham johnson and the the Hyperion did on these albums of Schubert art songs.I listened several times in this set but found it isn't easy for me to write dowm my real impressions.First, it gave me different faces of Schubert, comparied with the popular songs, ex Winterreise and the die schone mullerin. It's more pure and honest beauty expressed deeply to our soul.You should try the Vergissmeinnicht D792(forget-me-not)and Auf dem Wasser zu signen D774(To be sung on the water), Lott show sweet and nature characters of Schubert.It gave me good experience and confidence to collect others to listen, don't hesitate to buy it"
4,A Bit Dry But Worthwhile,Other reviews are longer and more in-depth. This is meant as a quickie.The title story is the heavy-hitter of this collection; it ties several shorter stories together under one title. The other stories are much shorter but have their twists and turns as well.The language is not as dry as one might expect from stories written a century ago.Worth four stars out of five.
5,"Practical, with attitude!","If you were a fan of Call for Help, you remember Andy Walker's madcap segments. From the bunny suit to the propane torch and marshmallows, this guy can take a complicated topic and make it easy to understand. Andy's attitude comes through in this book - it is easy to understand and fun to read."
2,"Confusing, unfocused, incomplete","I bought this book to advance from what I've learned with Microsoft samples and tutorials. The book introduces basic concepts in the first few chapters then did not provide any concrete examples or explanations. It doesn't even offer any examples on how to create a simple geometry in DX!! The coding style is so different from what MS offered that I had a hard time adapting. On contrary to the misleading title ""Advanced 3D Game Programming..."", it strays off and attempt to cover DirectPlay, DirectSound, 3D Math, AI(even!), and DirectInput in short chapters instead of focusing on D3D in-depth.To make the long story short, I'm back on Amazon looking for a decent book and revisiting Microsoft tutorials during the wait. Don't make the mistake of buying this book. I totally agree with everyone else's reviews! If only I checked the reviews on Amazon first :("
1,Save your money and buy something else,I only rate this one star because I cannot rate it no stars.I don't know why they bother updating this book everytime a new version of DirectX comes out. It sucks everytime.What they should do is throw out everything they have and start over.
1,Bends like a toy,These needles are very poorly built. Whatever metal they used is very soft. My three year old could have bent these needles in half!
2,Broke quickly,Picked these up at the local chain fabric store after the cheaper curved needles I had broke. I really could only used the smallest needle for stitching the back to the chair I was recovering. I broke after sewing about a foot of fabric. I wasn't even using thick upholstery fabric. Super frustrating. Now I need another set of needles. I'm going to look for stronger ones and hope that one day I can finish this chair without buying new needles every foot.
1,BROKE IN HALF ON FIRST STITCH!,FIRST NEEDLE BROKE IN HALF ON THE FIRST STITCH! THE REST WERE TOO BIG FOR WHAT I WAS SEWING...A TOTAL BUST!
3,it's ok,it's not for a professional...bends easily !!!!! would not recommend it for anyone sewing anything heavier than a flimsy fabric.
3,Daz u gotta get mo gangsta wit it,Daz kinda fell off on dis album. tha album got 3 out of 5. because the production on the album isnt daz'z finest. fo all u dat didnt hear my system remix or pt.2 dont bother given it any hype. the track iz weak. daz needs 2 up his game a little more on albums and less on mixtapes. this album needed some of his mixtape material and could have been a 6 star album. but if u a dat nigga daz fan then u should keep it in the collection. aight peace out fo now. Vinny Mac still ridin high.
4,Good comprehensive on exercise possibilities for BBW.,"This book is an excellent introduction or survey of fitness possibilities and information for Big Beautiful Women of all ages. I am tired of reading exercise books that discuss size 10 women reducing to size 4. At last, there is a book written especially for women of size, for our needs and goals. Learn about warming up, cooling down, garment selection, how to pace exercises for you, setting goals...everything you need to know the be in the best possible condition. This book was really helpful in getting me motivated and educated enough to begin and maintain my fitness program. Enjoy!"
4,Different impression following this CD,"I've always loved Silverchair. I have all of their albums, and consider myself a big fan, but I'd never heard them live until I picked up a copy of this CD set.Daniel Johns steals this show. He's quite a good singer live. His voice stays strong throughout, and it's studio quality. His range is wonderful. He hits all of the highs and lows to perfection. Not only that, but Daniel is very good at talking to the crowd. In ""Anthem for the Year 2000"", he screams at the crowd, ordering them to sing along, and said a few very funny things that I didn't think he had within him. I see the frail guy with the pretty face, but never knew what he was all about. His stage presence is very strong, and he seems like a really cool guy.I learned a lot by listening to the CD, and I urge any Silverchair fan to check it out."
5,Daniel Johns is God,"Holy mother of mary!never have I seen a group of people so talented come together to make beautiful music. In my 16 years of living, I have seen a lot of bands live, but never have i seen one quite as incredible as Silverchair. Simply put, Daniel Johns is my God. If you don't think they played a heavenly concert here, I want some of the stuff you're smoking. To all of the critics who think they could have done better, take some time and try and sing the way Daniel did...didn't think so. So lick my huge nuts"
2,Failed after 6 months,"Bought this from a local office supply store. I chose it because it runs on standard AAA batteries (I was tired of the special batteries my old laser pointer needed). Nice brass body gave it a comfortable weight, and the green rubberized cover was nice. The black cowling over the laser prevented audience members from being distracted by dispersion or glare from the emitting end. However, after 6 months of usage, the light faded, and replacing the batteries did not work. The proper direction for the batteries was not marked on the unit. Tried both ways, neither worked. Sorry it failed since the physical design of the unit is nice."
3,Okay product for light sweating,"This product is good for light sweating. What I liek is that it can go under many differnt articles of clothing. They state that it is for heavy sweating , however, I find this to not be true at all as it only buys you time if you are a heavy sweater. I also find that this company's customer service skills lack firendliness and kindness. If there is a [roblem they will promptly refund you."
3,Case Study In Grey,"In the ""Tango Player"" Christoph Hein skillfully adumbrates the grey atmosphere of East German society. While not as engrossing as his ""Distant Lover,"" which I'd easily recommend over this work, ""Tango Player"" is still a well-written and interesting glimpse into the former East Germany. In 1968, a year of remarkable political tumult, one would expect the main character, Peter Dallow, a historian, to be fully engaged in the events of his times. Instead we see through Dallow a refractory image of 1968: disengaged, socially sclerotic, and remarkably apolitical, even after being released from prison for taking part in the performance of what the State considered a defamatory song. This is one of Hein's greatest strengths: making the observations of alienated eyes somehow sympathetic. Not that Dallow is a sympathetic character, but he makes sense because Hein is so skilled."
1,Cheaply made and barely functional.,"I do not recommend purchasing this item. Since we take our shoes off inside the home, this unit gets daily usage. One of the plastic tracks broke when I was putting it together so it pops out if we're not careful opening and closing the door. When we open the top door, the entire unit tips forward so you have to hold it in place to keep it upright. We're using it for now until we finish doing some redecorating then will buy something different. Not worth the $100 price tag. Will put it out for bulk when we get a new cabinet as it's not worth donating."
4,Excellent Poker Story!,"Whether you like poker or not, This book is a great read and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the highest stakes poker game of all time."
3,High stakes poker,A good story that provides insight into the world of high stakes poker and the colorfull people who play.
3,Andy Beal is more interesting than poker,"I bought this book because I'm a poker fan and casual player. I love reading dramatic stories surrounding Las Vegas. However, I found myself more interested in Andy Beal throughout the book than any of the stories surrounding the games being played. Maybe it was my entrepreneur/business side coming out, but for pure poker alone this book wasn't that interesting. If there is a biography about Andy Beal, I'll be sure to read that next."
5,Pure Enjoyment,"If you enjoy poker, and enjoy reading, this is an outstanding book. No strategy, just a great story about what many of us can only dream of, a person who is filthy rich, up against people who would gamble on anything they feel like they have an edge at. A lot of fun."
3,Decent book,"Hey - bought it, read it, liked it. A lot of description of the big game, and an insight in the poker pros world. Unfortunaly absolutely no analysis of the high stakes poker limit at all...no insight in poker strategy on high stakes - that disapoints me a bit."
3,Impassioned exercises,"The band's interesting album approach is both a blessing and a curse, offering a fuzzed out buffet of undercooked morsels that rarely gets dull but never fully expands."
2,overclever mishmash,"a very difficult album to listen to all the way through. too many incompatible styles -- well-done, if quite faceless, individually, jamming all this stuff together results in an incoherent, overclever mishmash. ""multiple personalities"" becomes tedious really soon. it's not well-integrated, so the radical shifts and surprises just seem arbitrary. too bad."
1,Would not focus at any range.,"Would not focus at any range. Appeared to have been a used item. Sent it back and got the Yukon Sea Wolf 3X42 Night Vision Monocular, which is impressive for under $200, you just need to find a way to secure the lens cap to the lanyard, not hard to do."
4,Met all expectations,"Delivered on time and performed just as described and met expectations. Given as a gift to someone who has deer, bears etc. in his back yard and he was thrilled."
3,A Sister That just may be Perfect!,"Pretty twins Elizabeth and Jessica are talented ballet dancers,especially Jessica.Elizabeth cares more for reading and writing and tries not to show off.Jessica,however,finds life not worth living without tons of attention!!She is very unhappy when Elizabeth becommes teachers pet at ballet school.The sacrifice Elizabeth makes for her sister shows that she just might be the perfect sister if not the perfect dancer."
4,Good Book,This is the second book in the series when Elizabeth gets the part of Swanilda in Coppila Jess is jealous. Jessica knows shes a good dancer better than Elizabeth even. But their ballet teacher Madame Andre never praise Jessica no matter what she does she always praises Elizabeth. Will Jessica get to dance Swanilda? or will Elizabeth?
5,Twins both want solo in ballet!,"Elizabeth and Jessica both want the solo in the Ballet Recital as Swalida,But Jessica always the center of Attention has to have the spotlight away from Elizabeth.Elizabeth fakes an Injury just to make Jessica have her way,Ugh! Jessica always gets away with it,Except for detention in Jessica The Nerd and April Fool! She serves it for Elizabeth."
3,Not too good,"This book isn't great. It's number two in the sweet valley twins series. The first series like Sweet Valley Twins number 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 aren't as good as number 100 or something higher. This was okay. It's about Elizabeth getting a big part in ballet and Jessica getting a small part. Jessica think Elizabeth is the teacher's pet. Somehow Jessica will find a way to be noticed and get the big part, right?"
2,Boring Ballet,One of the less exciting novels in the series(but still good)poor Jessica is absolutely ignored by her cold ballet teacher who adores Elizabeth.
5,A great 101 book,"I took a course using this book during my 2nd year & learned a great deal from it. As a PSYC major, I was interested in how fundamental Sociology is in creating a foundation for psychological studies. So...in short, a sociology text like this should NOT be used just by Sociology students. It was definitely fascinating (as well as current, relevant, & unbiased)!"
4,Mystery find!,"Great writer! Wonderful and intelligent characters. Although, considered a 'cozy' mystery, this has lots of meat, wit and intelligence."
4,Track listing...,Tracks...1) Intro2) Dutty South3) 4 Deep Anthem4) Don't Get It Started5) P.R. Got Knocked6) Hold Me Down7) Echo Shawtty8) The Argument (skit)9) Lil Heavy Chevy10) Ay Papi11) Hangin Off My Diamonds12) Big Body Bubble13) Pearl14) Outro
4,Great introduction for Beginners,"This is one of the clearest and simplest books that I have seen for those just beginning to study runes. I do have some complaint about the Rune Guild basis that the author has, and his use of some of Thorsson's more questionable material. But in all, it's still one of the best books out there for beginners. The vast majority of the ""facts"" presented really are documented historical facts, not things that someone just came up with on their own, like you see in so many rune books. If the bit about ""Runic Psychology"" (or something else) bothers you, skip it and go on to the rest! The activities and exercies for beginners really set this book apart from others."
4,Excellent for a Beginner,"As someone new to Asatru and the Runes, I found this book to be excellent in presenting both. Easy to read and illustrated, this book helps a beginner to understand the culture and context of each rune. It offers information in a easily grasped manner without dumbing down the concepts.I especially found the chapter on divination to be useful. Starting with the Hammer Rite and the prayers, and ending with the Thank Yous to the Norse Gods, my divination experiences were better grounded and more connected. If you are starting out learning the Runes, I would buy this book to get the concepts before buying the 'more indepth' books usually recommended."
3,Yellow frame,Nice frame. I was disappointed over color of this one it is sort of a flat sort of dull yellow instead of a brighter candy color yellow. Seller packaged nicely.A+
1,BAD Sound Quality.,Very bad sound quality CD that you can tell it comes from a Vinyl recordor cassette tapes not from it's own master sources.Don't get ripped off.
5,"yes, yes, Yes, YES !!!","READ ALL THE REVIEWS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Then just buy it !Great stuff, I use it on any thing that needs an herb kick....from meats (pre-season before cooking so the flavors get into the surface)to vegetables and everything in between. Have used it for years.I like to cook and this is handy and a real timesaver."
3,A Little Something Fresh,"Easy, quick read. The book actually made me far more interested in Taoism than in writing. Ha. It's a good read for writers who are stuck in a rut and need a little something fresh to inspire them and get them going again. Most of the book (the first two-thirds) is about embracing a different perspective on writing and not so much about writing tips, etc. Ends with some writing activities and exercises to help apply the Tao.If you can get it for a few bucks, it might be worth it if you are needing to reinvigorate your writing practice."
4,Acne Rx - reading in hope,"This is an informative and compassionate testament to a life dedicated to overcoming acne. Dr. Fulton obviously knows his stuff and explains it simply. Although I am disappointed in not having more direction about using over the counter products, he does not plug his own line of products as the be all and end all. If you read your labels and keep in mind the ingredients he lists to avoid, you will do well. If you are suffering from acne, whether severe or even minor, this is an excellent resource."
5,Los Super Seven,It was amazing! I wish they had made a video of their first album; I would have bought that one also.
5,shiny,"they are much shinier than i had hoped for. smooth chrome finish and the middle is rounded out a couple of inches higher. excellent quality and value. they added a new, slick look to my buick for much cheaper than i expected."
2,Poorly printed and constructed book,"I haven't gotten through the actual text of the book yet, but I will comment on its physical nature. The copy I received is softcover with a glued binding. The cover damages very easily and didn't hold up well during shipping. Amazon packed it in a bubble-wrap envelope, which actually performed pretty well considering it looks like UPS ran it over with a truck at some point.The pages in my copy appear to have been run off of a low quality copy machine. The standard text is black and legible, but graphics or type in a larger font is very grainy and only in three shades of gray. The paper itself is very easy to tear and feels cheap."
4,International Edition,Correct book but received the International Edition. When I purchased the item it did not specify that I was going to receive this edition.
1,Another academic justifying a worthless subject and profession,This is a convoluted attempt by an academic to justify a worthless profession and subject. Using statistical analysis and great looking graphs does not make the concept any more worthwhile. Great for academia but if you brought this crap to your boss in a real work situation he would look at you like a alien and the probably hire someone with some common sense
4,A standard textbook for many Universities,"Market based management walks the reader through the basic foundations of marketing. Each chapter takes the reader through examples and explanations of these foundational principals.Although the text is clear, it feels like it is written by an accountant rather than by someone who writes for a living.This kindle version was disappointing with ye number of restrictions. Only my iPad was able to read it, and features like dictation were disabled.For the cost, rent or reselling is a better option."
4,Good material,Defintely recommend. Would consider keeping for future classes or questions. If anyone is looking for a full comprehensive guide then this is the book for you.
3,Not At The Top Of His Form,"I love Peter Abrahams and think he is a very talented writer. That said, this particular story is not up to his standards. I could not get past the fact that I did not believe that the protagonist, given his condition in the story, would be able to do everything he does in his pursuit of the truth of what happened to his wife years before. As the book went on, I had more and more trouble believeing the man capable of a lot of the physical action required of him let alone the tremendous mental strain he was under. There was also too many coincidences in the story to tie up loose ends. There have been many instances of stories where the main character is ""fighting the clock"" to solve a mystery that have been told much better and with more believable characters. Hopefully, Mr. Abraham's next novel will be a return to form."
2,"I finished it, and that was a challenge...","As I listened to this book I trudged along wanting to see how the author would work it all out...and that's the only reason I finished it.I have to agree that the diaglogue is rather stilted (as another review stated ""don't answer a question with a question"" -- so much of that!!) The main character has very few redeeming qualities...he seems to be out of touch with the world, very assured of his own opinions and beliefs, and in denial about so much in and around him. And his naivete, for someone of his age and experience, is astounding.I listened to this book and the meandering story could have been told in three fewer CDs and would have been much more interesting."
1,Dull,"I thought this would have been a more interesting story. However, I was disappointed by both the plot and the characterization (and Abrahams' numerous cliches). The lack of these elements weakened the overall narrative arc."
2,Unlikeable main character,"Nerve Damage is about a scupltor, Roy Valois, who learns he is dying of an inoperable, incurable cancer. On a whim, he looks up and reads the obituary that will be printed about him in the New York Times. He finds that it inaccurately states where his dead wife worked, and he makes it his mission to investigate and correct this mistake. But is it a mistake? Or are there secrets his wife never told him?I would classify this book as a conspiracy thriller. The premise really intrigued me, but I had a hard time enjoying it. I simply disliked, almost hated the main character. He just wasn't likable. He was in complete denial about his condition, and while this may be a common stage, he just took it too far.And his attitude and treatment of others? He just rubbed me the wrong way, and I couldn't get past it.Overall, the story was exciting, with some good twists and turns. But the ending was too fairy tale happy to fit the rest of the story."
2,Intriguing Until -,"I have never met a PA that I didn't like. In fact, he's one of my favorite authors.This book did not disappoint- until the end. You'll race through the fast paced chapters and assimilate possible ending scenarios but unfortunately you'll most likely come up with a better ending than the author."
5,Great Shoes,These shoes are great & comfortable. It's hard to find Navy shoes that go with jeans. I saw these on another website which usually has great discounts. These shoes were still around $80 when I got them here for $29.95. Can't go wrong. They are also sized right.
5,Great for business,Great for receipts...all in one place having the days and months all in one keeps these small things nicely organized!
2,"In showing what a "" gala"" is,they used none gala film clips.","The discription and information was very good for the Gala section of this video. I was very disappointed that they did not use film clips of actual gala events but rather showed pas de deuxs from the full length ballet with corp de ballet and scenery. A gala does not look or have the feel of a full length ballet. The specialness of a gala was well discribed and then fell far short in the the clips they used. I'm sure there are many clips of actually gala events that could have been used and should have been used to give the non ballet enthusiast a true feel visually of a ""Ballet Gala""."
2,Could have been much better,"This book was required for an intro to sociology class that I took and although this book is 'introductory', I felt that it could have provided more examples, sources, and evidence to the concepts it was attempting to convey. Another issue I had with the book was that the graphs that it included were ofter hard to decipher and were included with little or no explanation. Bottom line: Although the book does offer some interesting and useful information, it lacks helpful examples and explanations, so if possible choose a different intro to sociology textbook."
1,Required,"IF this book wasnt required i would NEVER read it, and i like reading. The quality of the book was good and I received it quickly."
4,A promising beginning,"The first book of a series, and it came out of the gate with a bang (no pun intended). Holly Lisle has a very readable style. The characters are well developed and likeable. Yes, that's important, at least to me. I deplore the trend of characters so flawed you'd rather the author just have a hole open at their feet and swallow them up than continue reading about them. This book is nothing like that. The characters are clearly defined, have some intense problems, experience triumphs and setbacks, make and end relationships. Good thought was given to creating a distinctive universe with its various peoples and the laws that govern it. I will buy the next book, and hope to say that the excellence continues."
3,Too many storylines,"while i loved the premise of this book, the author was a little too ambitious. there were too many storylines and not enough character development. however it was worth reading and i enjoyed up, down, and sideways worlds."
5,Read in 2 Days!!,"I read this book in two days, and that was only because I had to stop and do mundane things like sleep and go to work. I absolutely loved this book. Actually, I like all of Holly's work. It's totally unfair that I have to wait until next year to read the next one in the series, but you can bet that I'll be the first one in line to buy it when it does. Thanks for a great read, Holly. Keep 'em going, please!"
1,It would be nice to have a brief synopsis of the book's story.,"It's probably a great book but, unfortunately, there is no synopsis of the story! I'm seeing this more and more when I try to preview books to try."
5,Music that envelops you in its warmth.,"""Dark of the Moon"" is the second CD Grey Larsen has recorded in collaboration with the young guitarist and bodhran player Paddy League, and every note of it is an enchanting, musically seamless journey into the soul of Ireland. Whether he's playing the Irish flute, tin whistle, concertina or melodeon, Larsen exhibits a musicianship that is consummately skilled but never showy, always evincing his love of Irish music and his delight in sharing it with listeners. The same can be said of League, who unobtrusively but firmly establishes himself as Larsen's equal. Like a glowing hearth fire, ""Dark of the Moon"" envelops us in its warmth and light."
1,ONE WORD:TERRIBLE SERVICE,"I ordered a seiko watch from bodying, the watch shipped from Malaysia??? and came in a broken box. I was so excited about the watch I looked past that and started wearing it. The watched advanced about 1 minute everyday, and when I didn't wear for about 3 hours it stopped, So pretty much every morning I had to adjust the time. When I wore it continuously I still had to take the time back 1 minute everyday. When I tried to contact them, I got an e-mail full of the word ""KINDLY"", there was nothing kindly about the e-mail, they refused to do something about the defected item. I wrote to amazon, and they refunded me immediately. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS RETAILER. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE, THERE ARE TONS OF GOOD SELLERS ON THE INTERNET."
1,Returned watch - No refund,"We liked the watch, but thought it was too big. So we returned it. It has been several months and we have heard nothing nor received our refund."
5,nice watch,"I have also the 007, and I prefer the black dial, but this watch, the 009, like the 007 keeps good time and it is a classic. The blue dial is a very dark blue. You need to wear it every day, unless you have a winder, and it is +10/-10 sec a day, which is really good for a automatic watch. If you want more accuracy, do yourself and everybody else a favor and get a quartz watch."
3,Not Bad!,This book was cool. This is my favorite goosebumps book. This book was almost as good as K.A. Applegate's books.( P.S. Part of the reason why I liked this book is because I love dogs.)
4,Good but could've been better...,The Barking Ghost wasn't that great but still worth reading. I was hoping at the end that RL Stine would make a part 2 since those 2 kids turn into chipmunks at the end. Oh well...
3,It was good but twisted.,It was a good book but a little bit boring and confusing.I liked the beginning but the first three chapters were vey boring. But in the fifth chapter it fianally got good the ending was seriously twisted
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!,This book started a little bit scary and it jumped to VERY scary. I loved this book alot. You did a good job. Well done Mr. Stine. I would recommend this book to any kid. P. S. Keep up the good work Mr. Stine. I love your books. Please write another new book.
3,Spine chilling!Disappointing end.,"This Goosebumps book was very disappointing,I expected more of this highly reccomended Goosebumps book. It all started When Cooper heard an eerie sound in the woods,not long after he moved in. As he was walking in the woods he met a girl called Margeret.As he turned round to make his way back home he realized that he was lost,he made an attempt to find Margeret but instead he found two dogs,ghost dogs with bloodshot eyes."
2,brian wolfe yeahhh!!!!!! the barking gost,"This book was ok if you are nine years old, but me--I did not like it. It was a good quick read, but other than that it was not frightening, it was really short. Its plot was childish, and it did not have a very good ending. This book was meant to be read buy younger kids (nine to ten years old) and if your older than that you might like I but I did not it was good for quick reading. During the plot it was easy to predict what would happen next. So yeah this book is good for younger people, it is also a good quick read, and it is very easy to predict what's going to happen next."
5,Bad dog. Really BAD dog.,"IT'S A DOG-GONE NIGHTMARE!Scared of his own shadow. That's what everyone says about Cooper Holmes. But when the Holmes move into a new house deep in the woods, scary things really do start happening. Problem is, no one believes a scaredy-cat like Cooper.But then no one else heard th bone-chilling barking late at night. Or ran into two evil-looking dogs who disappeared into thin air...."
2,it was a little strange,I like the parts when they met up with the dog but it was not scarry enough to keep my attention. The grand master said that this book was the worst of the worst of the worst!!!
4,Bad Dogs By madalyn olsen,This book is about a boy named Cooper and his friend Fergie. They keep seeing ghost dogs. The ghost dogs lur the kids into a shack in the middle of the woods. They go into a room called the changing room. The dogs turn into humans and the humans turn into ghost dogs. The ending is great. I hope you will like it as much as I did or more. I wont you to read this book if you have not.
2,Things that go woof in the night,"Cooper is afraid of everything. At the start of the story, his family moves to a house in the woods. A girl warns Cooper that the woods are haunted, possibly their house as well. When Cooper encounters 2 snarling dogs that give chase, he is terrified. But it gets worse when he sees them leap through a wall...A disappointing Goosebumps. The plot was too much, what with the origin of the ghost dogs and that ending."
3,A Louder Barking,"The first time I read this book I loved it. I was about 11 or 12 years old and the subject matter was frightful. I read it again because I had liked it the first time and needed a quick read. This book, especially for older teenagers, is a good quick read. I still liked the plot of the ghost dogs frightening the main character Cooper and his friend Fergie. Eventually leading them to an old shack and switching places with them. And the sibling rivalry between Cooper and Mickey is funny and relative to most teenage siblings. There is another strange twist at the very end of the book which leaves you on the edge of your seat. The Barking Ghost is a good book to read for fun."
4,Superb Toolbox for EVERY Parent,"Regardless as to how your child behaves, Ross Greene's work is an exceptional set of tools for improving that child's problem solving skills and ensuring a more balanced approach to parenting in your household. The best aspect of the work is the three pronged approach. The Plan A, B or C allows parents to coordinate their efforts to improve behavioral issues with less disagreement on approach.The book reads well and the examples, while tending to the extremes, are easily relatable to any child. This book is a must for the parent of the special needs child (ASD, ADHD, PDD-NOS) or of a child experiencing any stress (divorce, death of a family member, transition). Enabling children to open up, confront their own feelings and properly identify obstacles and skill gaps is an invaluable tool whcih will serve them well throughout their lives."
5,For anyone that deals with Kids... or adults,"This is an amazing book. It's not so much only for explosive child, but an explosive person. You must understand that there is no magic pill, or instant fix, I work with people (including explosive children) everyday, the more you practice the techniques the more effective you will be utilizing them. If you've been using other techniques (forcing your will... because I said so, or rolling over... fine just this once) you might want to read this one, to find out another way. it shouldn't take too long."
5,The best book I've read recently,This book explains how to approach some of the youths with difficult behaviors that is very effective. I use it daily in my work with children.
5,excellent,"A lifesaver- this book offers techniques to help tantrum-prone children for whom more ""conventional"" parenting techniques just don't work. No time-outs, tokens or rewards charts. Now in its third edition."
5,Help for all parents,"This book was excellent. It really makes sense. The hard part is putting it into practice, but it does work. The only thing it doesn't address is consequences for agreements that have been broken by the child."
4,A valuable resource,"This book should definately be on the shelf of any parent whose child goes beyond just being ""difficult."" It helps parents understand what is going on with their child and use parenting techniques to make things better for themselves as well as their child.--Sheryl Gurrentz, author of ""If Your Child is Bipolar"""
2,Confusing and Unhelpful,"I was very disappointed in this book. There was never any clear discussion of what symptoms or characteristics one might use to classify their child as ""explosive"" other than one who throws a lot of violent fits. But there is a big difference between a ""difficult"" kid and one who is emotionally incapable of controlling him- or herself.Also, the book devolves quickly into doc-speak, bandying terms like ""separation of affect,"" ""working memory"" and ""shifting cognitive set"" which had me seeing stars. It's almost like you need to be a psychologist to even begin to understand what the author is talking about.From the ratings, it appears that many others have found this book to be helpful. But it left me frustrated and confused."
3,An Introduction to Alternatives,"You can get the gist of this book by skimming through it. It speaks to cooperative communication and problem solving with the child instead of the authoritarian approach that is so easy to fall into (do it because I say so.) The approach would be beneficial for any child. There are quite a few examples written in dialogue style to demonstrate the technique and the author talks about common mistakes made when first trying to use this method. The three main points are - show empathy, describe the problem, invite the child into finding a solution."
4,Helpful Book,"This book was very helpful. A different perspective to the explosions and the different methods of dealing with them helped us which, in turn, helped the child."
5,Half way through and my house is 70% calmer,Our psychiatrist recommended this book. It's filled with under lined passages and post it notes and I'm not even half way through.
4,Very informative read.,"The Explosive Child: A New Approach for Understanding and Parenting Easily Frustrated, Chronically Inflexible ChildrenSo far for us, this has been a great learning experience. But it is far from over. We are learning to communicate better and more effectively for all of our benefits. We aim to have a more loving and peaceful home with the help of this book."
3,Not easy to use on a young child with behavior problems.,"Dr. Greene offers wonderful information that could probably enable you and your child to modify their behavior problems. This book is not easy to implement on a 3 year old with ADHD. I encountered difficulty in being the facilitator for my childs behavior. I had to recognize the ""vapor lock"", try to reduce her anger to refrain from the ""meltdown"". It was way too much work for me, the parent, to maintain while trying to discipline my child. I turned to other parenting books for easier approaches to reduce my ADHD childs aggressive behavior. Those worked much better without creating additional stress for me."
4,havent finished yet,"im not done reading the book, it is taking time to capture my attentionwhat i have read has been helpful"
1,Of course Dr. Greene's book will help......,"If your only goal is to prevent your child from having meltdowns, Dr. Greene's philosophy of creating a ""user friendly"" environment is for you. This is an environment in which family members and teachers create a universe in which your child is the center and everyone plans and lives their lives with the singular goal of keeping your child happy. As I read this book, I became more and more disappointed. The world is not ""user friendly,"" and simply preventing a child from exploding by indulging him with anything he wants is, unfortunately, not going to prepare him for the real world. How about some useful advice on how to help your child DEAL with frustrating situations and people? I guess I'll have to go to another book for that, after I stop at the dumpster....."
5,The Explosive child,The strategies in this book have brought peace to our house. The trick now is getting the school on board. May need to supply them a copy of Lost In School.
5,Finally! Someone who really understands!!!!!!!,"If you live with an explosive child, you've probably tried all the behavior modification techniques out there. If your child is like mine, nothing has worked yet. Don't give up. Get this book. Devour it. Give it to anyone who interacts with your child. Dr. Ross really understands what makes explosive kids tick, and he offers a loving look at how to help them and how to make your homelife much more enjoyable. We're down from one melt-down per day to about one every couple of weeks -- primarily thanks to the way Dr. Ross taught us how to relate to our wonderful, inflexible child. If you ever get a chance to go to one of Dr. Ross' seminars -- go!!!!!"
4,a very useful book,I have read a number of books on parenting children with challenges and I found this to be one of the best so far. It does a great job of explaining what the kids are experiencing and gives concrete ideas for reducing the explosions.
1,Just take a pass,"I checked this book out of the library to figure out how to better manage my oldest son. I put it down pretty shortly after reading the part where the author claims that your child is not behaving obnoxiously on purpose but just can't help himself and doesn't understand what he's doing. (""These criteria [for oppositional defiance disorder which, frankly, I do think is a bit of a crock] imply that oppositional behavior is deliberate, and I don't think that's true in many cases."") Well, maybe not the cases he's seen but definitely it's on purpose in MY house (""Mommy, would you like to go up the wall today?"" Sigh.) I put that one down and had VERY good results from10 Days to a Less Defiant Child: The Breakthrough Program for Overcoming Your Child's Difficult Behavior. It's shorter too!"
1,"Excuse me, but...","I absolutely hate parenting books like this. I'm a kid and I'm NOT explosive, but my little brother tends to be kind of stubborn. However, how insulting is that to find your parent reading ""The Explosive Child?"" I understand her reading a parenting book, but come on, the title totally gives away what your parent thinks you are. It's just a book filled with huge labels and it says so on the front cover. Now, I'm not saying I've read it, but seriously, just read it in the library. Don't bring it home--unless insulting your child horribly is your plan of action.Consider yourself warned."
4,A great guide for parents struggling with an explosive child!,"I was pleasantly surprised by the straightforward approach to this book. Instead of a psychobabble, Dr. Greene explains potential reasons your child may be struggling to control his/her outbursts in language a layperson can understand. More importantly, we found very practical, effective help for dealing with these frustrating explosions that have become very disruptive to our family. I feel hopeful after reading this book that we can finally help our child deal with the frustrations of life in a healthy, appropriate manner. If you are looking for solutions without thousands of dollars in therapy and medication that may not be warranted for your child (although sometimes it certainly is), I would highly recommend this book."
4,best for older children,"I'd heard about this book from a friend who is a child psychologist and it seemed like the first step for us on the road to helping our son. However, he's only three years old and the book seems intended for the 8-12 year old set. I still found some of it useful however."
2,"Basic information, very repetitive.","I had to read this book for a graduate class I was taking in special education. This is the kind of book you read where you're starting to question if your child has emotional issues/scratching the surface. It got very boring/repetitive after a while....case study, after case study, after case study.Save yourself some time, just read the 1st chapter and the last 3 chapters of the book, and its basically like reading the book!"
3,"good, BUT....","It focuses on BEHAVIORAL ISUUES because that's what we are dealing with, BUT some of these kids have MEDICAL/NEUROLOGICAL reasons for this behavior.We shouldn't be so quick to judge a child in public unless we know what is REALLY WRONG. Disease can cause behavioral manifestations. Is This book appropriate for this type of child? perhaps, but it's only a coping skill, not an means to and end."
2,NOT FOR TODDLERS!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY if you think this is for your toddler! I bought this book for my daughter for her 2 year old. I should have done better research on the book. We have a very frustrated 2 year old and I thought this book would help. It is for school age children up to past the teen years. I did not read the entire book; after I determined it was not for toddlers, I stopped reading. I have no clue if it is good reading advice for your school age children.My copy will be returned."
2,Sucker punched,"Was told by our family therapist to get this book. Ordered this one, not knowing it was the First Edition published 10-years prior. Make sure to check the edition. The newest is 2010."
5,no-nonsense realistic approach,"This book has a practical, no-nonsense, workable approach. As a long time teacher I've seen many approaches and been given many ""fix-its"" but this one is the best and really works. I also like the fact that he does not claim it's easy like so many, he's realistic and that is reassuring."
4,Parenting a difficult child,"This book accomplishes two goals: 1) helping parents recognize that the behavior they find so difficult and frustrating in their child has an organic basis and is not willful rebellion, 2)If they are willing to change how they respond (ie their parenting style) to this child things can get better."
2,Didn't help much.,"I borrowed this book from the library several times because I couldn't just finish reading it without disagreeing with the author. The only thing that helped from this book is the idea of reasoning with my child in a more extensive way (compared to how I talk to my typical kid). It was hard to read. There's a lot of dialogues. There's a point where violence and disrespectful behavior cannot be solved with just talking it out. I needed a step by step guidance that's well balanced. I found ""Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach"" by Vincent J. Monastra. It's my go-to book. So far so good. Less defiance, tantrum, and explosions. The thing is there's no one-size-fits-all deal. You gotta find the best method that works for your family."
5,Good Resource,This book was recommended to me as a parent of a gifted and talented child from another parent of a gifted and talented child. Great resource!
5,Some folks just don't get it,"I'm not one to write reviews, but the lack of enlightenment of some of my fellow Explosive Child readers is disappointing (though not surprising). This book saved my kid and my family. It's easy to read, accessible, practical, and makes a ton of sense. I didn't find it to be repetitious at all -- whatever repetition exists merely cemented many of the concepts presented earlier in the book (adults don't change their behavior just because they've read something once or twice). Thank you Dr. Greene -- I think your work is positively revolutionary!!"
2,Waste of money,"I snagged this book on the advice of a friend. Do you really need a book to figure out what it takes to work in a sales role with in the pharma industry? There was no real insight gained here. If you don't already have some clue about what qualities companies are looking for, this book isn't going to teach you. I've been in sales for over 10 yrs, and this was just money flushed away. Might be decent for a recent college grad that has no clue what they want to do, or how to go about doing it, but as a tenured professional, save your money."
4,Could be bigger,"I got this for my nephew, hoping it would be be similar to the T-rex I had when I was a kid (the Jurassic Park rubber-skin giant toy).The Toysmith T-rex is hard plastic with a moving jaw and some arm/leg articulation. Though the paint job and ""texture"" of the skin was cool, I thought it was somewhat small."
2,2 and 1/2 really...,this just drags on and on. it seems the author just dictated strait to the publisher. the info's winded and one dementional.
1,Outdated and inaccurate,"I don't know where to start. This book recommends activities that I consider to be catastrophically bad for hedgehogs, like keeping them on cedar shavings, which can cause respiratory failure. I just can't recommend."
2,Great for the Basics,"For the new, inexperienced hedgehog owner, this ""manual"" may seem like a god-send, but don't be too hasty to snatch one up and treat it as the all-knowing guide to hedgehogs. The very basic information provided is quite valuable for learning about behaviors and functioning in natural environments, but most sections on care and housing are outdated, to say the least."
5,Woman as Butterfly,What a marvelous movie. Sensitive and inspiring.The film truly captured her spirit and gives us all thought how we could live our lives better.
3,What can you say?,"It's a football flag, seems to be pretty good quality. Only one thing wrong with it is it's a Jets flag. It's a Christmas gift for a friend and it's so nice to see the Jets struggle this year. If it was a Redskins flag, I would have given it 5 stars, just saying."
3,Kubotan Manual,"I was looking for a users manual that would show may different strikes using the kubotan;but this manual's main focus was using the kubotan to place a suspect under arrest. It focuses on many different joint locks using the kubotan to subdue a ""perp"" but only a couple of pages demonstrating different strikes. I'm not a martial artist who knows many different strikes that could be employed with the kubotan so this book was a disappointment for me;one would be better off getting a martial arts manual with strikes and then practice them with the kubotan."
3,Antique Zoology Lecture,"The book's copyright is 1935 which makes it an antique book. Nevertheless, this book contains the basic principles of zoology and can be a good source of lecture material for introductory zoology."
5,I adored it.,"I teach elementary school, and I originally got this book because I was instructing other teachers on how to incorporate multicultural folklore into their classrooms. However, this book ended up spending most of its time by my bedside. It is SO GOOD. I came across it by accident, but I totally love it, just as much as I love my anthology of original Grimm's fairy tales. If you have any interest in the nuances of folktales, and if you love looking for similarities between cultures, start here. It's amazing."
5,Finally XM in my Dodge Caravan,The Dealer told me they couldn't install this kit because it would replace my dvd player. This kit has a bypass so both can be installed (or a cd changer instead of the dvd). Installation was easy (once I figured out how to get the dash cover off). System works great and can't be beat for the price.
4,A very fine little book with a lot of helpful information in it,"Tom Valentine has written nearly twenty booksin a llooonnggg career that started when hegot his first REAL journalistic job as aSports Editor in California. In 1966 whilecovering a story for an alternative cancertreatment, he found his true calling (checkout the ever growing Tom Valentine.com sitefor more). Fot 22 years now he has run Carotec,Inc. a very fine health company. This bookfrom 1984 was right after Tom started workingfor the Spotlight Newspaper. It contains valu-able information on health, that was expandedby his fine 'Search For Health' large formatbook of 1996. Check them both out!"
2,Stitching on strap not very strong,"I want to start off by saying that I LOVE this bag, and I am fussy about handbags. Unfortunately, I have only had it for a month and a half, and the one side of the strap came off. There is a chance that the stitching might have been a bit shoddy just on mine, but the bag is a bit too pricey to be falling apart after such a short period of time & use. If you choose to purchase this handbag, I would proceed with caution as Fossil doesn't offer any kind of repair or replacement service."
4,General Grant...and more,"The paucity of source material utilized by General Fuller is more than offset by the lucidity of his commentary, and his keen insight into the military mind and psyche. Grant, the man, appears to have been a hobby of Fuller's, and while there are better analyses of the details of Grant's campaigns and battles, the reader leaves this book with a sense of knowing and understanding Grant, and believing that Grant's personality was the critical factor in the Union's 1864-1865 Virginia compaigns. The assessment of U.S. Grant is Fuller's personal assessment, nevertheless, when this reader finished the book he hoped Fuller was right. Essential Civil War reading. There's also some interesting commentary on the theory of military strategy and tactics."
3,Not Brown,"Corduroy Boogie has a few highlights like Dancin' and Breathe Inn. I love Ivana Santilli's style and her voice, but I think she plays it safe with this set of recordings. There is an edge missing that is clearly demonstrated with the lead single Deserve. Although a great song, quite safe in my opinion. The songs that feature Italian or French lyrics come off as cheesy."
1,Disappointing...,"I was not impressed with this followup to her first CD ""Brown"" which was very good. I would recommend passing this up although there are a couple of nice cuts on here. Overall: Not good."
1,Easy to get drum beats....,Mediocre vocals - kinda sweetmarketing (her look) over rides musicDope trackspoor songwriting - not much development from 1st album'trying' to be this UK viby - trip hop act but remains at Canadiana pop-try-hard.....Check out Esthero for quality and revolutionary style and sound.Check out Fiest for authenticity and talentCheck out Astrud for originalityGet the point?.....
1,Drive failed after 4 months,"This is the most unreliable hard drive I have every bought. I use it for 6 hours once every month for backups. After 4 months of very light use, it started to fail. During backups, the hard drive light would turn red and stay on continuously (the red light of death). The system freezes (Win XP) until I turn the drive off. Needlessly to say, the backups also fail when this happens. Stay away from Cavalry."
4,"Too Many Cords, But Otherwise Okay","Other than the fact that this product requires a lot of cords (one from the outlet to the external, and another from the external to the computer) and the switch, this works fine. The hard drive is quick, quiet with the fan, and looks great. If it were a little lighter, that would be nice too, but hey, its 300 GB."
1,Stay away from this manufacture,"I purchased one of these drives about four months ago. It has now died. I have requested a replacement twice now and cannot obtain a response from this company. The drive was very loud until it died. I cannot recommend this drive or company. I had some very good data on the drive, which is gone now. Looking back I can say I got what I paid for a very unreliable drive for the money. Stay away from this manufacture"
2,Defective power-on switch,Drive works ok but power-on switches off lots of times. I will ask for a replacement.
2,Died a month after the warranty expired,"I bought this Cavalry 400GB drive to backup my desktop files. It was easy to set up and worked great for a year. I went to look something up on it recently and found that it wasn't any longer showing up on my desktop. The blue power light was on so it had power. After trying to shut it down, reboot my computer and hook it up to a different computer, nothing recognized it so I determined it was just dead. Of course it was a month after the 1-year warranty expired. Now I don't have back-up and need to buy another drive. It won't be a Cavalry and probably not a Western Digital, since they make this. It isn't reliable."
1,"Piece of Junk, dont trust it!","Purchased this new and it started to have read errors about a month later. Piece of junk died some 6 months later taking all my backup data with it.Do not buy, do not pass go, do not pay 200!"
1,Bad decision,"I ordered 2 of these since the price seemed pretty good. One for me and one as a Xmas present. The one for me was immediately used upon arrival, but totally died within two weeks. I got a red light on the front of the unit (indicating failure) and the ""clicking"" sound of death for a hard drive. Since this happened to mine, I didn't want it to happen to the other one that was gonna be a present so I sent them both back and got refunds. Be VERY careful if you get one. Who knows what may happen to it down the road (2 weeks, 2 months or 2 years)."
1,Beware this drive!,"Bought this drive a couple months ago, should have known it was trouble when it got extremely hot to the touch and made a weird noise from the git-go! It seemed to transfer date quickly, but needed to be turned off when not in use due to the heat of the case.(Guess the power button was good for something!) Then, yesterday, after transferring some files I had spent about 8 hours cleaning up and consolidating,It Failed this morning... message consistently said disk was not formatted and my data was lost. Thank Goodness, I kept my original data on my desktop! This drive occupies a place in my garbage can as warranty work is usually too much of a run-around, and the product is useless. Don't get suckered in! I do have a different Cavalry ext. drive with an internal fan that has been a good product. I have used it for over a year."
1,quicker to throw your money down the drain than buy this,despite claims it had to be reformatted to work with a mac. the technical support line helped me reformat (which was very quick and easy) and then i downloaded a back-up. after that one time however it turns on but does not connect to the laptop. tech support keeps trying to tell me to plug in the usb cable (as if i didn't know) and can not help. so i tossed it in the garbage. money down the drain on a useless product
2,Easy to use but Loud and Unreliable,I purchased this external hard drive for long term data storage a few years ago.It's loud and unreliable. Luckily I was able to get my data off this thing before it completely died after only a few years of light usage. It was louder than my computer.It was easy to use and performed well before it started to crap out.I do not recommend.
1,Worst Drive on the market.. BEWARE!! Cavalry CAUE37250,"I have purchased three of these drives each one was a replacment for the other. The drive is defective, overheats and is a bad deal. BUYER BEWARE!!"
2,Broke,"when i got it it worked fine for a few months and then it fell off a book it was on, 1 time, (at most 2 inches) and never worked again apparently it wasn't built for duribility"
2,not bad for two stars,"For $50 it wasn't bad, but overall I don't like it just because it's clunky and you have to plug it into the wall for it to work. Other than the lack of convenience, I didn't have any problems tranferring files onto it. For the cheap price, it served my needs for the moment. I will probably give it away eventually, but it will work for now. Looking back I'd probably spend the extra cash for something more portable."
5,Very good for the price,The Cavalry CAUE 37250 HDD is a very good option for mobile storage. I have also to say that the service I did use in the replacement of the first product I bought was more than excellent!
4,External hard drive,"seems pretty good. doesnt come with any directions on how to transfer files from your ""C"" drive into it."
4,Nice product.,"Nice product, work as expected, only downside is the big ugly blue light on front. Nothing a piece of electrical tape wouldn't fix."
4,pretty good,this drive has lots of space and hasn't given me any problems. it's a little noisy but it's not too large. i had to reformat it for my mac which wasn't hard once i googled the instructions.
3,"6 months later, still working.","As i said, it's been six months and it's still working just fine.The reason it gets three stars instead of four is that it seems to take time to warm up once plugged in... which I find odd, but that may be common to all external USB hard drives. I honestly don't know."
2,Quality & Value,"So far I'm quite pleased. I had purchased a Western Digital portable hard drive (120 GB) which was useless, as neither of my computers, Mac desktop & laptop, had sufficient USB power to run it. For ten bucks more, the Cavalry was delivered to my door, gave me 250 GB, and worked right away. I downloaded PsyncX onto both computers to run a backup.========UPDATE: When I connected the hard drive to my new iMac, the drive died, and I lost all of my data."
3,"Nice product, but...","It is a nice product, but the power supply wire was broken after 2 months of use. An item like that should be more resistant to movement, cause we assume that an external drive should be portable"
4,Can't say first hand....,I bought this for my brother for Christmas one year and although I can't say first hand he says it's a great external. It may be a little expensive for only 80GB so I would suggest shopping around but still a good product.
1,Drive no longer works.. any opinions?,"I've had this terribly heavy and bulk 500 gb hard drive for about 2 years. I rarely use it, but's always on and I keep critical files on it.Well.. it died. The red light comes on it turns blue. Thought this brick was so well built that it would never die.I tried to plug it into another computer.. still dead.Question. - I'm going to buy another one from a guy on ebay. I want to swap out the old drive into the new case. Is this a sane plan to get my data back or is this crazy?Anyone ever try this? I was hoping to find someone on youtube or something who will show me the process.Certainly not the big honking wonderful brick that I thought it was. I have 2.5"" form factor drives (the ones that don't require external power) and they always work. This thing is a piece of junk."
1,one month life span,"I bought two of these units for MP3 archival purposes. Both failed within one month. My sister had the first and just decided to pitch it. Cavalry replaced the second (my shipping to California), and it too has recently failed (IO errors). Great archive; time to re-rip my 2500 CDs. Avoid Cavalry products!"
1,What a fiasco!,"I just bought this drive a couple of months ago and have only been using it for about a couple of weeks and today I got the red light of death. It flickered blue and then red and then blue...I immediately set about copying the image files I had just been working on and I see that the files are being copied intermittently (when the light flickers blue - a few MB's of files copy, then it's red again and copying stops, then blue...). Right now, if it keeps going, it will take about 11 hours to copy this one folder of images - OUCH! As soon as I get as much of my recent work off as I can, this is being sent back and it will be the last time I buy a Cavalry Hard Drive!"
1,bad device,"ordered this hard drive in march, sent it back in april for replacement, got another, computer would not recognize it, sent that back also on april 6. still waiting for refund!!!!!amazon has recieved my returned items, but still has not issued my requested refund."
1,Bad product doesn't work at first time,"The external hard drive doesn't works at first time, I'm from Venezuela the cost for returns it is too expensive for me and I forget return it from Venezuela, I opened it and see the internal of this divice, the hard drive is barracuda seagate remanufactured and I prove it in my pc and doesn't worked, don't spend your money, the internal hard drive is remanufactured."
5,"Wonderful disc, with, I am fairly sure, a MISPRINT!","This is a lovely recording of some of Stanford's finest compositions. However, the back cover says ""George Viliers Sanford"". There is no such person. The name should read ""Charles Villiers Sandford"" This is an obvious misprint. But still, a great disc!"
4,Good Deal,"Got this item shipped very fast. Works as advertised but the instructions say it is ""water resistant"" not water proof as listed in the ad. The batteries it uses are a little expensive. Overall very happy with this item"
4,Useful item,"I'm really glad I purchased this Yukon night vision system. It's a great asset on my job site. The price is unbeatable too. You can go with some fancy thousand dollar systems or purchase these for a few hundred dollars and get basically the same results, it allows you to see at night. I'm very happy with the product!"
5,great quality & value for a Gen.1 unit,"for a Generation 1, this unit has a good quality tube, clear image & good light gathering ability and is extremely lightweight (better than my MK-390's which has a larger 90mm lens, 4x the weight & 3x the cost). Only gripe is the IR light - its only good for 50 yards & creates a focused light beam in the center of the view screen, but I'll just buy a 3W IR flash light to use for longer distances. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase. At 1/15th the price of a Generation 3 unit, its a great value."
1,disappointed,"dont buy this item. i purchased it and was highly disappointed. i paid $180 for this item and at night i couldnt see 2 feet in front of me. i could see what i was looking at better with my naked eye. i dont know if maybe the product was defective, as i bought a yukon night vision at a sporting good store with a 4x50 for $30 less and it is great. this monocular took a specific battery that cost $18 for 2 and now i am stuck with them. the one i own now takes 2 AAA. be sure to check out what kind of batteries they use. they also need to inform in the ads and on the box the vision length in the dark not just the magnification. this unit was about 4 feet, my new one is about 100 feet."
4,Yukon monocular,the monocular is good for the complete dark night. no change in zooming.no change in focus . the iluminator is effective. fun when you have an application
3,Decent night vision,"Night vision works with low light, was impressed with the IR in complete darkness. Having trouble dialing in the focus, so far good for 75-100ft would like to see out to 75 yrds. Gave this as a gift, disappointed the box was beat up."
4,"Compact Night Vision, just wish it were color . . .","Waterproof and compact for the boat, perfect when gunkholing and entering a secluded anchorage in the dark with no lights or nav-aids. Did not test the float factor, but brighter color would be helpful for recovery if it did splash inadvertantly. Have to report how long batteries last, as the CR batts are pricey"
1,POS,"Would not work past 10 yards. have used many models of 1,2,3 gen NV and this is about as bad as any I have seen."
1,Disappointing!,"The small print on the box tells us that the tracks may be re-recorded by the original artists, and that featured groups may not include all the original members. Perhaps that's why this CD is such a waste of money! Listen to Ray Charles's re-recording of 'Georgia on my mind', and expect to shed tears - tears of disappointment!"
5,Can you say accelleration?!!!,"After installing this filter in my new 2009 Ford Ranger, I imediatly noticed an increase in accelleration!! It might be hard to keep tires on my truck with it barking off the line like that!! :)Love this filter!!"
5,K&N,"I got this filter for my 99 mazda b2500, pops right in and you can notice a difference right away. saved about 20 bucks ordering it from amazon"
3,K&N vs. AFE PRO DRY S Drop-In Panel Filters,"You would be doing yourself a disservice not to compare. Build quality, filtration, flow, oil free, price, etc.Research the BITOG site for used oil analysis (UOA) testing from various panel filters and unbiased reviews.Their findings may surprise you what's getting past some popular air filters, including many open air intakes.aFe 31-10020 Air Filter"
1,Misleading salesmanship,"I was expecting to see a fairly exhaustive review on horse behaviour and EXPLANATIONS or at least studied observations on why horses do a certain behaviour. Dr. McDonnell does have an exhaustive list and pictures of various horse behaviours, but virtually ZERO explanation on what or why. She lists other books and references. I was extremely disappointed. The ads surrounding the book gave the impression it would be much more than it actually is. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone trying to learn about why horses do what they do."
2,We buy 2 Item and received only one.,"Dear Srs, We never received the second item and I see in the status that it was delivered both, please check and contact me, thanks you.We only received one.Thanks,Mi email: mauricio.mu@gmail.com"
4,Love it!,"This is one of the coolest movies ever and I'm glad I bought it. If you ever come across the soundtrack, grab it! Because its hard to find."
5,awsome movie!,"This Movie is awsome! Its very violent, especially when billy gets stabbed in the neck with a fork!This movie is both funny, violent, action and a romance. Its all the above! I would reccommend this movie to anyone who likes a little thrill. Action-packed totally!"
2,not better than natural born killers,it was a good movie but i think a rip off of natural born killers
4,this one rocks!!!!!!!!!,was this out first or was it natural born killers?who knows?they are both good though so whats it matter?2 lovers get into trouble over a robbery gone wrong and have to bail out.the only person i recognized was that dj chick from full house.she played a heroin [prostitute].thats quite a switch from miss goodie 2 shoes from the tv show.its a bit violent for kids.there is a lot of speed use in this one also and one guy takes lsd so its not for kids.there are a few really amusing robbery scenes in this movie.
1,Mis-advertised book!,"This book was NOT what was advertised. My copy had no pictures. The type is typewriter type, very light and hard to read.Badly organized information.....I am a horse person and was very motivated by my trainer to read this book, but I may even send it back.Too bad, because it probably has some decent info in it. But it's so poorly put together I don't want to bother reading it!Spend more money on a better quality copy!"
2,love to cook,too much prep and doing time don't mind cooking but like it plain and simple sent it back but still like to cook
3,"Good quality, Audio doest seem to be shielded however.","I bought this to run an AV feed from my computer to my receiver on the other side of the room. The video feed is fine, but the Audio does not seem to be shielded. I'm using a Sound Blaster audio card which has performed perfectly since I installed it, but when I use this wire there is a significant loss of audio quality over the 50Ft distance."
1,Machinations revealed,"Intereesting to see Mr. Feith's true Zionist ideology revealed. FYI, Mr. Feith is the individual accused of personally falsifying the intelligence within the Department of Defense in order to make a case for war with Iraq (i.e., the whole WMD thing). Anyone who refuses to believe that the Iraq war is surrogate war for Israel should read this book by Mr. Feith to learn where his true fealty lies."
3,one sided,"hello, I'm a big fan of certain classic arab philosophers.but I think Mohammed was a little severe.why? they have to say PBUH after every mention.so I'm going to side with the Sufi instead.I think a book like this is a little doctrinaire.I mean, come on, fellas, is this heavy zionist jingo or what.but hey, I think some Jewish comedians are funny and I haven't heard of many arabic comedians unless you count that Sahl character. oh wait a minute. that fella that plays Klinger on MASH. definitely Egyptian.what a howl. well, wait till the pharoah hears about books like this.he'll never let the people go.that's all I have to say now.salaam and shalom and all that nice stuff."
4,What if dinosaurs had not died out?,"This book by Dougal Dixon asks, 'What would the Earth be like if dinosaurs had not kicked the bucket?' The first chapters deal with evolution in general and with real dinosaurs, where they came from, how they changed and why they might have died out. This is followed by chapters that deal with the different regions of Earth, how they have changed over the millions of years and what the animals are like. Not just dinosaurs either, but also creatures evolved from birds, pterosaurs, sea-reptiles and other animals. As in 'After Man' the whole book has been designed like a non-fiction text book, or a nature guide, but doesn't seem as detailed or as fun. While Dixon's 'The New Dinosaurs' seems slightly more realistic than 'After Man' which had such weird creatures as parashrews, it also seems to have less imagination."
3,Not as good as After Man,"After Man was probably the most fun text on evolution I have read. New Dinosaurs was not. The book is based on a fairly simple theme: what would happen if the dinosaurs had not gone extinct and this is a wonderfull concept for a Dougal Dixon book. However, New Dinosaurs did reach it's potential. It is badly illustraited (it seems that dinosaurs, if left to themsleves would evolve into something like how we saw them in the fifties), not particularly informative, and some of the new dinosaurs are completely implausable. It is obvious that Mr. Dixon did not spend the time and effort on New Dinosaurs that he did on After Man."
2,The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution,"Good-but not very relasticDixion really should have bothered to look at the state of the world in the last 65 million years, because their are events that would still have happened. For example, birds would not have become extinct, neither would the mammals, both were doing very well. Also, the Pterosaurs would be extinct, or close to it."
1,Jacked by Captain Jack,"For the price of this used almanac, originally 19.95, used 75.00, I was disappointed in it's quality and thoroughness. The Canadians do a better job with specificity of tide and current maps. I contacted the seller immediately wishing to return the item and he ignored me."
1,Crude and Offensive,"I found this book to be crude, offensive, disgusting... The voice of the author is so adolescent it made me cringe- talking about a woman's ""headlights"" and giving ""hand jobs."" Gosh! I thought I left that kind of talk behind years ago. It was kind of creepy for this old man to talk this way. I do not recommend this book for anyone who wants to approach sex from a mature perspective."
1,AWFUL!,"This author acts like a pervert. Not a christian. He treats women as sexual objects made for mens desire. I mean, aren't men suppose to have hearts for their wives? Can't she have a break after she gives birth???"
1,Major concerns,"I think this book had a definite purpose to say that anything within the bounds of marriage is ok, including sex toys. I think most devout Christians will take offense to this. Not to mention he never bothers to comment that if one partner has biblical concerns about any act, the other partner should honor that. I didn't find this book to uphold a biblical standard for the sexual union within marriage. There are much better books out there for couples who believe sex is a gift from God not to be abused with worldly attitudes."
1,"This is not Sheet Music, This is a book","False advertising. I ordered Sheet music and it sends me some sexual intimacy book. What is this.I get it after weeks of not having any music to play, I open it up and the first thing I see are words,Me being illiterate in English and only able to speak Music didn't have any idea what in the name of god this was."
5,Baby Boomers Be Free,"I have read many of the negative reviews of this book. It's sad that they cannot see the true value of this book. The book was recommended to my husband and I by a Christian couple whom we trust and who counsels couples in their marriages. From a ""baby boomer""'s perspective, this book is so freeing! It debunks many preconceived notions of what sex should be like in later life. I like the fact that he put a disclaimer in the book that if you don't want to read very descriptive explanations of sex, then the book isn't for you. I highly recommend this book to everyone, but especially those married ten years or more. By that time, sex can be ""another thing to do"" or you may worry ""will the kids hear us"". God did make us to enjoy the sexual act, and He wants us to enjoy it in marriage."
5,Sheet Music,Another great read for couples. Recommended by our pastor and I would recommed for any couple. Delivered quickly and in great condition.
5,Excellent & Down-to-earth,I was looking for a book that addressed sex from a Christian perspective and my mom recommended this book. My fiance and I have been reading it together and it's great! It has lead us to discuss things that we hadn't thought we needed to talk about before getting married. Further I have been able to recommend this book to married friends who cannot wait to read it and are sure to reap benefits from it. It's a terrific book!
2,catered to the almost married,"The book's okay, but if you're already married be prepared to skip over the first 6 chapters because it goes into detailed information for engaged couples that those of us who have already been there don't need to be lectured about. Other than that, it's pretty enjoyable."
5,"Perfect guidebook for those who are married or cnsidering it, at any point.","Wonderful suggestions. My wife loves me more each time I pick it up. We share some wonderful interests in the points this book makes. If you're already marrried, this could save you from a future of counseling."
4,Sheet Music,"We give this book as wedding gifts and to other couples we think would read it. It is a very personal book, with lots of details. But if you will read it, your marriage will benefit."
5,great refresher for our marriage!,"My husband and I have been married for 17 years. We have always had a great marriage with good sex. After reading this book, I began to really understand why my husband does and says some things OUT of the bedroom. Now, we have a wonderfully blessed marriage with amazing sex! I would recommend this book to any engaged, newlywed, or long-time couple."
4,GOOD READ,I think it is a good read for both husbands and wives. Very interesting. Tells it like it is for the most part.
5,Excellent,Brought up a lot of things we never would have thought of before. Recommend reading the suggested chapters when engaged. Humorous writing style that keeps your attention. Lots of good examples of things couples could struggle with.
5,"Freeing and Empowering, based on God's Word",Let the truth set you free. Enjoy a sweeter marriage than you thought possible. Read this book together and renew the spark of intimicy. I am so thankful for this book.
4,Whoah-it's racey!,"This book was a little more descriptive than I had imagined, but it was a great book to refocus my attention to my husband and his needs. Overall I enjoyed the book and the idea that sex should be an exciting experience and not something that you just get over with. It was nice reading a book like this from a Christian perspective"
5,Preacher Recommended,"Our pastor recommended this book (from the pulpit) to every married couple in our church! It is a frank, accurate, informative book on the importance and the execution of a healthy sex life within a marriage. The author doesn't sugar-coat anything or tip-toe around the matters of sex. It's helped my husband and I improve our sex life and our communication about it! I strongly recommend it to anyone -- newlyweds and oldlyweds -- seeking to improve their marriage or their sex life!"
3,not worth buying unless your relationship is disfunctional,"i had this recommened at a conference, sadly I was prepared to enjoy amd even eager to read this book. I found it disapointing, not particulary interesting and certainly not entertaining. I am not sure who would enjoy or benefit from this book but not I, married for 21 years in a satisfying relationship."
5,Wonderful!,"This book is absolutely wonderful! It is so nice to get a good Christian view on God's creation of sex. We are so bombarded with a perverted idea of sex in the media, and this book is refreshing to read. It is very educational and helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,Very Insightful,This book helped me understand how men think about sex. It helped me realize what my husband needs. My brain is completely different. Everyone needs to read this book.
4,Good Christian Marriage Book,This book was a great book for any newly married Christian couple or any couple experiencing a lack in their physical relationship. It is a very open book without being overly graphic.
2,NOT BIBLICAL,"Picked this book up along with Act of Marriage and Intended For Pleasure. At first I enjoyed the different perspective on a few topics, but was very shocked to read very un-wise suggestions. For example, the author suggests the groom-to-be engage in pre-marital lust before the wedding night. If I want worldly wisdom on the subject of sex, then I'll read Cosmo magazine. For couples looking for solid biblical and medical advice, my wife and I both highly highly recommend Act of Marriage instead."
5,Excellent Faith-based and life giving,"This is a great great book. The place to start for any christian couple, especially those engaged like we were when we got it. If possible read some parts together."
5,"Practical, Thorough, and Fun.","After checking out other book similar to this one, this is the best one I've come across. Dr. Leman has a very approachable writing style that makes reading the book fun. The best thing about the book is that fact that it does get very specific in the material it covers. Other books like to talk about the general ideas, but never get to the point of covering the details."
5,Fantasic!,"This is one of the best books my husband and I have ever read. It's very practical and Dr. Leman's humour is over the top! I believe this book is a must read for every happily married couple. I'll probably start over and read it again, it's that good!"
4,Christian Sex Book!,"It's about time an open, honest book about sex has been written for married Christian couples. Dr. Leman had wonderful insight for men and women on how to enhance their sex lives through God's view of marital sex. I have recommended SHEET MUSIC to several friends who have also enjoyed it."
2,Not for every couple,My wife actually checked this book out of the library to take along during our 27th wedding anniversary trip. We have 13 children and have a very good relationship. Dr. Leman's advice to couples to use physical intimacy to combat the stress that we as couples deal with is good advice.Later in the book he devotes a couple of chapters to oral sex. There are some references to the Song of Solomon regarding justification for that practice. It's quite a stretch to presume that God smiles on that practice by simply quoting some of the scriptures referenced. Current medical advice also discourages it because of viral (and possible bacterial) infections that can occur in the mouth of those participating.My advice would be to take the other chapters and glean from those what you can. Just don't take another man's word for what Scripture says. Read the Word for yourself!
1,This Rates a Big Zero,"I've only read some of this book, which I have decided is not Christian at all. There is nothing in it to indicate that the author has anything more than a nominal Christian position, certainly not a Biblical one. I agree with those who found it pornographic in its emphasis. What makes the author think that perversions of the sex act are a-ok is beyond my comprehension. If you want a degraded sex life, then this is the book for you."
2,Really?,"Well, while I think much of the advice in the book is worthy, as a married woman I didn't get much benefit from the book. I felt like every other page mentioned just how much ALL men wanted sex ALL the time and women just have to stop being selfish and saying no. Really? ALL men want sex ALL the time? ALL women say NO? I don't think so."
3,some good ideas,"this book is mainly geared towards new couples. there are a few good ideas for those who have either been married for a while (I would say over a year or two), did not live a completely Christian life before, or were married before."
5,Sheet masterpiece,"Sheet music is a must for any married couple who wants to improve their relationship in or out of the bedroom. My wife and I started reading sheet music about one month before we got married. We have now been married for six weeks and are still reading the book together. I know that we are still ""honeymooners"" and were still just learning in the bedroom but I believe that Dr. Leman's book has been really helpful. Dr. Leman has a very conversational tone throughout the book yet he can be very direct. It is very easy to read and my wife and I have been growing through our times in the book.If you are happily married, unhappily married or getting married soon then I strongly suggest reading Sheet Music."
1,Sketcher review,"I was somewhat unimpressed with the quality of the shoe, additionally it did not seem to be true to the size (wider than a well made shoe of medium width). Overall I would consider it a shoe for non athletic purpose."
5,All charged up !!,"The Dekcell Camcorder Battery charger is a great deal. I purchased (temporarily) a charger at my local ""big box"" store for a little over $45.00. The price I paid for this charger AND two batteries plus shipping was $46.00. It works as well as the factory charger, comes with an auto adaptor and can be used for different voltages in different countries. Great accessory at a great price."
3,Samcorder Battery,This thing sucks!!! Loses it's charge quick even after a full charge. Cheap price...Cheap Product
3,Feels a little flimsy but it does the job,"This is a decent charger for the JVC camcorder batteries. It's got a couple of buttons on the side I didn't know about, which turned out to be battery testers (I guess). You can press the button with the battery attached and it will light up an LED bulb if it's got a charge on it.The second button was some kind of blue/black light LED and I don't understand the purpose of it but it doesn't harm anything.The Electric plug folds out of the way when not in use and the whole thing is very compact. It doesn't feel like it's made out of very sturdy plastic but it's durable enough for the job. It's not wise to let it drop from more than a foot off the ground, but as long as you're not dropping it a lot or throwing it, it should hold up well. I haven't had any troubles with it.It's worth owning simply for the fact that you can't always use the camcorder itself to charge the battery, or you can use this as a way to charge up a spare while the main one is charging up."
5,Gets the job done.,The charger was actually a double charger and works like a champ. I love being able to charge my batteries while using my camera so this was a huge hit with me.
2,Evans NPG + Coolant,"I like the pitch of this product but it won't allow the proper use of my ESPAR blockheater due to it's viscosity.Soooo, OEM compatable? Not really........................"
5,Awesome product!!!,I have a 2000 BMW with over 200k miles and it's nice to not have to worry about coolant changes any longer. We also moved back to Houston from northern VA and the extreme heat and humidity associated with this area is no longer a concern. Excellent product by and large.
2,"In a word, a RIPOFF","This book is more like an expanded, cheaply produced pamphlet than a real guidebook. It's small, insubstantial, poorly produced, and has little useful information compared to the other guidebooks I consulted. It has the feel of amateurish reviews from underground or college newspapers. This book would probably be rather useful if you want to connect with the Las Vegas gay community, or if you're moving to L.V. to attend college, or if you wish to pick up prostitutes, or if you are into binge drinking on a budget.I did appreciate the information on coffee shops and bookstores. Other than that, there is little here for the tourist who just prefers to stay off the beaten track."
4,Schwarz was NOT duped,"Firstly, there is a new paperback version of this book, which I have been very impressed with, good quality and nice cover. (Get that one!) Now to review: This guy HAS done his homework, has NOT been ""duped"" and was in fact on an E! special all about the Hillside Strangler. This is an excellent book about Ken Bianchi, and regarding the so called ""faking"" Schwarz explained that Bianchi could indeed have been a multiple when first arrested, but throughout all the interviews, multiple psychological testing, it was likely that these multiple personalities became self-aware."
5,Schwarz did his homework,"I am a big serial killer buff and have a fairly large collection of books and videos about mass murderers. This is easily one of the best I've ever read:it places you inside Bianchi's warped mind and discusses possibilities for why Bianchi killed. Ranks up there with The Only Living Witness, Buried Dreams, Confessions of Son of Sam, and Silent Rage."
4,timely delivery,"The CD is excellent, and arrived well ahead of time, unfortunately the case was damaged on arrival."
4,DVD overkill,"Elvis' black leather performances as most people know, are a truly amazing rock and roll experience. He rocks the hell out of his old 50s hits and sings them as if it is another artist, with a heavy rough voice.However, the bad points of this DVD set is repitition, and eventually overkill. There are two leather stand up shows and two sit down shows all on disc one and disc two, which is basically the same songs repeated. Sure Elvis does say different stuff, and there is a different camera angle ect, but it is basically the same.Disc 3 is truly horrid, outtakes from the drama sequence that looks very dated, and should only be shown to Elvis completists, or big fans that want every little scrap of footage of Elvis.For the casual buyer wait until the single disc arrives next year."
5,Fantastic!,"I come from three generations of Elvis fans. I know most of his musical catalog, and I have to agree that this is Elvis at his finest. This DVD reminds me of why I am an Elvis fan.Musically, it is some of the best he has ever done, but on a personal level, he never looked better. He was thin and tanned, and he had just become a new daddy. It shows on his face. He looks so happy. And, Elvis in black leather, it really doesn't get any better than that, ladies! Wait. It does. Check him out in his black velvet outfit!! WOW!I watched this with my 72 year old mother, and both of us spent the 90+ minutes drooling and singing. If you are an Elvis fan, this DVD is a must. I hadn't seen this special in its entirety since the 70's, and I had forgotten how great it was.Even my husband, who thinks Elvis is okay, liked this special."
3,dissapointed,"Overall this dvd is very good great picture great sound but I'm only giving it three stars as they have left off ""It hurts me"" off the Guitar man production number (on the first disc) although it is stated on the packaging as being in there between Big Boss Man & Guitar Man."
5,elvis at his best,this is an excellent display of elvis presleys extreme talent and explains why he will always be the king
2,Elvis 68 comeback special,Having seen the original program i found this dvd in complete and quite dissappointing. Needs serious improvement.
1,What A Shame !!!!,"Elvis loved his fans and he would not have approved of how these specials have been marketed. RCA/BMG...Priscilla, Lisa shame on you for ripping the fans off. We bought the Deluxe versions because we we're told they would have all of the rare footage on them but now all of a sudden new footage for these programs have just appeared YEAH RIGHT !!! The die-hard Elvis fans will buy these too get the footage but it's a shame that we have to fork over 15 more bucks for a few minutes of footage...Gee whiz I guess the estate needs more money since they only made 52 million last year... What a shame and everyone thought Col. Tom was bad."
3,Needs editing,"I didn't realize this was an uncut version. What that means is that you just start to get ""into"" it and then they cut and start over on the same song. I should have just gotten the one dvd that I assume (hope) was edited.If you're looking to really get a feel for how Elvis worked then you will like this but I was just looking for entertainment."
3,Hmmmm,"This DVD is Elvis as you never saw him before. The DVD, however is extremely repetitive. There is absolutely not enough songs performed on the movie. Its basically the same stuff over and over and over again until you are absolutely bored. I am an extreme Elvis fan and ill have to say I was a little dissapointed. SO MONOTONOUS! You can definately tell the King is not happy to be there in some segments. The first DVD is the best with the 2 different set down shows but again just different crowd same acts. The second is the 2 stand up shows and they are alright but do not compare to the sit down shows. The third disc is horrible. Just Elvis lypsinching with no crowd doing songs that are not that great. All in all if you want a better value and a much better dvd of Elvis try the Aloha from Hawaii dvd. Definately a much better performance and better quality with the King doing some great songs."
5,Elvis at his best,"Takes you 40 years back, when we were young and he was at his best, full of life and joy, and gives you the very taste of 60-es."
1,vocals not in synch,My copy of this DVD has serious synch problems with the vocals and the film portion. There is a delay of almost a second which makes it pretty much unwatchable. WIthout this problem I would give it 4 stars.
2,Elvis Comeback dvd,I did not care for theese dvd's The second and third dvds have out takes and i really did not enjoy them the first dvd was very good
5,the best collection,hey im 26 but i dig elvis he had an amazing voice and was a great song writer and piano player he was cool before the word cool in 1968 the king returned to take back his crown from the beatles this sets awesome you see an older wiser elvis on top of his game theres so many cool moment like women going crazy cause elvis tosses his scarf you really see a legend performing like sinatra or marylin monroe elvis was a real star and no singer today has the voice he did
2,not worth the money they're asking for,This dvd should have been 1 disc instead of 3 and therefore priced that way. Instead greedy NBC wanted to make a big profit and added all this extra footage of outtakes. Please the comeback special broadcast would have been sufficient. If you like to see Elvis start a song and then stop because of some problem then you'll like this dvd because most of it is just that but I found it was very annoying and unnecessary. Hey NBC are you not making enough money that you have to suck every dollar from poor hard working consumers. Shame on you.
3,déception,"Je ne m'atarderai pas sur le show lui mme on a tous la mme avie ""splendide"".Le dvd par contre l'est beaucoup moins,l'image est tres semblabe au vhf et contrairement au dvd ""ELVIS ALOHA FROM HAWAII""le son est décevant car mal distrubier on entend la voix du king ds les speakers arrière et le sons fais tunel.Bref l'ÉQUIPE TECHNIQUE na pas fais ses devoires et nous offres un 5.1 tres tres ordinaire et je suis polie,donc déception.(écoute avec lecteur pionner 333 et ampli denon avr-2801,speakers paradigm)"
2,Elvis 3 set dvd - comeback tour,I was very happy with the fast delivery service but disappointed in the fact of the 3 dvd's as they were very repetitive. Seems like for price could have been cheaper for basically the same dvds.
1,unreadable disc. No customer service,I paid for two DVDs and both were unreadable and I could not get anyone in customer service to respond to me. The worst.
3,Good package but.......,"I bought this for my wife as a birthday present. Very nice package and great performances. I wish I'd known the whole first disc is black and white! The product description does not mention this. I thought this was the original broadcast with extra stuff but I'm not so sure. The show was broadcast in color, so why the black and white footage of the special?? Otherwise it's great."
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"This is Elvis at his absolute BEST! After all the years of mostly bad movies, he was out to show he still had his stuff. And he showed EVERYONE! Even non-Elvis fans who see this are blown away by his performance. He was at peak form in voice and physically. I was only 12 at the time, but it left a strong impression. If you were female and had a pulse in 1968 you couldn't have seen this and not been ""impressed""!"
5,"Elvis ""The 68 Comeback Special Edition"" = Great Television Footage = A Great DVD!!!!!!","This was Elvis'great comeback to performing rock & roll, after the time he spent in Hollywood making movies. I love the way it starts off with ""Guitar Man"". In this song, he refers to going to Memphis, then to Mobile, Alabama, Staying at the YMCA, and going on down to Panama City, Florida. I can relate to all these areas, because, I used to live in Mobile, plus I've been to Memphis, and Panama City, many, many times.Anyway, you get to hear his classics, such as ""That's All Right"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Hound Dog"", ""Can't Help Falling in Love"", ""Don't be Cruel"", and others. Plus, he does a tribute to Gospel Music. He performs another ""series"" of ""Guitar Man"", and ends the dvd with the song, ""If I Can Dream"". The dvd includes bonus material of ""Having Fun in Burbank"".This is a great dvd, and I highly recommend it. Thanks, thanks very much!!"
5,ELVIS '68 Special,This is a fantastic video of the special with Elvis Presley jamming with his friends for a studio audience. Although I do have a bad disc in the set which still needs to be replaced.
5,ELVIS 68 COMEBACK,WOW...I JUST LOVE THE DVD111 ELVIS LOOKS GREAT!!!!!!!! DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition!!!!!!!!
5,The ultimate package of the Singer Special,"Seven hours. That's how much material you'll find on this DVD set of the Elvis Singer Special of 1968. I was absolutely fascinated by the various takes for some of the songs and sequences. You even see the clapboard and listen to onstage chatter.I've read numerous Elvis biographies (the best: Peter Guralnick's two-volume set, LAST TRAIN TO MEMPHIS and CARELESS LOVE) and this TV special was one of Elvis' defining moments as the king of rock. After 9 years of cheap movies that squandered his talents, he found the raw, emotional energy he'd tapped into at Sun Records the decade before. There are moments when he's putting so much into a song that he's really shouting, ""No, this is me!""Now I've got to check out the special edition of the ALOHA FROM HAWAII concert.For the Elvis fan, it's a must-have."
5,Elvis '68 Comeback,"Elvis: '68 ComebackI really liked this '68 Comeback of Elvis's. I can remember when it aired on TV, altho for some reason I didn't get to see it all then. I liked the joking, cutting up with his band members and friends. And the music as always was Great. What a talented man he was. Beautiful voice (he had matured quite a bit from his voice of the '50's). And he showed more of his human side of himself. I did not get the one that had the 3 disc in it, thought it was a little pricey. But I would recommend this for anyone who loved/liked Elvis. That was a Special moment and time in his life, getting back into doing what he was so good at. His movies for the most part were all alike and he was sick of it. His Fans were all still there, tho most were older (but not all) and loved him and his music."
4,Impressive,"I bought this for my wife, who loves Elvis. She remembered this show from its first broadcast. I was impressed with Elvis' singing and showmanship."
1,Elvis Presley el mejor,Compre este DVD y para que me gusto la calidad de la imagen es buena yo le doy 5 estrellas
2,Not worth the money.....,"I wouldn't waste my money buying this dexuxe edition.....For the money I paid, it wasn't worth it.Just buy Elivis 68 speical.....Then you get youe money worth.I wish I could sell this......I like Elvis,but they should be a shame to charge what they did for this....Don't was your money.Want to buy this from me?????"
1,poor!,"Elvis Presley's 68 Comeback Special is a poor concert. Many songs are turned into medley's(who only wants to hear a partial song?). Also Elvis's performance just isn't anygood, and the setlist leaves a lot to be desired. Not enough big hits, and I hate the gospel medley, awful!"
1,Don't bother....,This is highway robbery! The original show was lame for it's time and NBC (or whoever) is charging WAY TOO MUCH for this set. Do you want to see Elvis the right way? Buy the deluxe version of Elvis Aloha From Hawaii (money is much better spent for quality and quanity). Pass on this one!
1,Cadillac Riding Cowboy (Amazon Instant Video),This rental was a total rip off! This is not a video...it's just a slide show with a few songs. The songs aren't even well produced and the sound was poor quality. I can't believe Amazon allows this to be listed as a video! It would help if the description for this item contained a warning or an alert as to what you about to rent! I give this the poorest rating possible and would like a refund!
4,"Gouseppe Tucci in Mustang (and not ""Guiseppi""...)","In this new reprint of his travelogue of an exploratory trek through Western Nepal in 1952, the legendary linguist and tibetologist, Giuseppe Tucci, describes his experiences and discoveries as the first 20 century western scholar to travel through the region.His account preserves an invaluable record of the art, culture, social and religious practices of the inhabitants of Mustang, prior to the inevitable changes that have since occurred, with the intrusion of the modern world and regional politics into this ancient land.It's interesting to compare the meeting of Tucci with the abbot of Lho Manthang with the Peissel's meeting (read: Mustang, Royaume tibetain interdit)"
2,A disappointing buy,"I bought this book for my daughter who will be going to preschool next fall. She loves Maisy, so I thought this would be a perfect way to introduce her to the concept of 'school.' Not quite. The book includes pictures of Maisy doing things all on her own, no teacher or other kids involved, no saying goodbye to Mom or Dad in the morning. Plus, the book is small and the pull tabs are really hard to maneuver. The book was ripped apart in a matter of two days after my daughter tried to pull and push tabs on her own. I could barely get them to cooperate myself. We love Maisy, but I'd skip this book."
3,"Good idea, but the book could be better constructed","I like Maisy in general, and the easy-to-relate-to illustrations and descriptions in this book in particular. The tabs bent and the pages tore (where the tabs are inserted) within an hour of reading, though. Some pull-tab books have thicker pages and tabs so that this doesn't happen (for example, the _Wheels on the Bus_ book by Zelinsky). Wish this book was sturdier."
3,Memorable but less desirable pull-tabs,"My son enjoys all the Maisy books. Maisy Goes to School is no exception. When he talks about school and you ask him a question he correlates to Maisy. This to me is a great children's book when a child remembers. However, the ""Lift-The-Flap & Pull-The-Tap"" was found it to be less desirable. We have had no difficulty in the construction of other ""pull-tab"" Maisy books (ie ""Seasons"") but all the ""pull tabs"" in ""Maisy Goes to School"" do not withstand a child pulling, mostly the one for the pencil."
3,"DVD was good, but extras didn't work...","The DVD was great, it was very easy to follow and showed how to make the dishes step-by-step, but I was really disappointed because it said it should work in a computer and there was a link to print out all of the recipes, but it didn't work. I tried it in several different computers, MAC and PCs, but no luck. I also tried to contact the company for help, but never recieved and answer. One of the main reasons I bought this DVD was for the recipes so I was disappointed. If the extra features had worked, I would have rated this DVD a 5."
1,Doent work around corners,"Even with the unit set for max distance (70'), the alarm did not work past 20 feet. When I set the sensor around any corner, the alarm never went off. It seems that the unit I had needed direct line of sight. I'm going to find another manufacturer."
5,One of the most adventurous sagas I have read.,"Hrolf's Saga is written in a style that most closely resembles Saga of the Volsungs about Sigurd the Dragon Slayer (the source of the Wagner opera). Although difficult to summarize, this saga set in Denmark has better characters and pacing than the longer ones set in Iceland (Njal's Saga, Laxdaela Saga, Egil's Saga, Eyrbyggja Saga) and the story possibly dates back to the 6th century AD. It is also noted that it shares some kinship with Beowulf. Although only 78 pages, the story moves quickly and is a good trial book for those who have never read an Icelandic Saga before. As with the other sagas was written in the Christian era, in the 14th century, but still remembers older traditions."
4,Exciting reading,"This is an excellent translation of an interesting Viking saga that has many parallels with Beowulf. The original author of this saga is unknown. It tells the story of King Hrolf Kraki's family and how he became king. There are also tales about his champions, their families and how they came to be in the service of Hrolf. This is one of the shorter sagas, only 77 pages, and reads easily. The story is filled with battles, sorcery, greed and deception. There is also an excellent introduction and notes section at the end of the book."
4,ATV Spreader,"All in all, the overall quality of the product is good. The packing, was not. The spreader and it's accompanying parts were in just a cardboard box, without any packing material. A couple of the pieces were broken and/or bent when we unpacked it...thank goodness for a handy husband or else the spreader would not be working. Assembly was fairly easy and straightforward. The spreader works fairly well, with a couple of minor modifications. Overall, a good product."
3,3M Micropore tape,I gave this 3 stars and probably not the fault of the tape. My apnia mask was sticking to the bridge of my nose causing it to be very red and welt. Purchased this item to be a barrier and prevent sticking (at the time was not aware of the mask liner). I placed the tape over the bridge of my nose and slightly under my eye lids. That worked very well but it stuck so well to my skin that it was very painful to remove. I found that if I stuck two pieces together (one shorter than the other) and left a tiny amount of glue on the ends exposed it held well enough thru the night. I also tried the popular brand of mask liners by itself. That irritated the bridge of my nose also. In the end to solve all problems I place the tape on the bridge of my nose (as noted above) and use the mask liner.The tape is a very good buy especially when occasionally on sale.
5,Great value,This tape was purchased to use with an urostomy bag. It is gentle to the skin and sticks good. Love it
5,Low price best quality,This is good quality 3M tape in a bulk package. The savings are considerable over even drugstore house brands. The tape was delivered quickly and arrived in good condition.
4,tape,After receiving the proper order paper first aid tape is a good product and provider honored his order and was timely delivered.
3,Slightly antiquated Bonsai book,"While the trees themselves have not changes, books have. This book is good, but there are better Bonsai books out there that are available for the beginner. Check out ""The Complete Book of Bonsai"" by Harry Tomlinson instead"
1,Is it his wife?,"I am not a sexist. Women, generaly, write every bit as well as men, and often better. But every sentence crafted under the stewardship of the Eddings couple causes my bile to rise anew. So trite, so banal, so. . .bad. I keep asking myself, is it just that I was really young when I read the Belgariad? I did read it in my early teens, but I was fairly well read then, and I don't remember it being anything like the peurile swill they've got us slogging through here. Very disappointing. Even worse than the Althalus book, and that was pretty bad too. I swear he's letting his kid write it, or something."
2,Once again - it falls flat,I want to preface this review with saying that David Eddings is one of my favorite authors. I will continue to buy anything he writes with an expectation of a good book.Having said this - the 2nd and 3rd book in this series did NOT meet with approval. The first book was decent bordering on good but it ended there. I bought all three after they had all been published and must say I was disappointed.If you are new to David Eddings - you may like these. If you don't like them... Do NOT give up on his works!!! Go back to the Belgariad and read the whole series!! This is a VERY good fantasy writer!!
1,Is the fourth book necessary?,"I have read everything Eddings has written (fiction and fantasy) and this series is easily the worst of the lot. The duo Eddings use the same device: group of people from different parts of life band together, add a deity or two--win the war. It worked superbly for the Belgariad and the Mallorion, I could put up with it through the Elenium and Tamuli and I even let it slide for The Redemption of Althalus but for The Dreamers Series it is unforgivable. The aforementioned series is not well written, this series is filled with repetition, poor jokes and little imagination. He would have been better off to tell this story in a single volume or not at all...."
4,The book was in good shape. I only wanted it for reading purposes.,David and Leigh Eddings are excellent authors. I've read the Belgariad series and the Elenium series. The Dreamers is also excellent.
5,Crystal Gorge,This book was in excellent condition and I was able to donate it to the local library to finish their set of this series. I was impressed with the price and the condition. Thank you
1,repetitive at the least,"I agree with most of what was said regarding this Eddings series. And to not make his same mistake, I will not repeat the comments again. I can't help wonder why the change in publisher though? His previous works (I have them all) are mostly Del Rey. This series is Aspect publishing, a branch of Time Warner. If the publisher did this, it's a horrible decision and Eddings should take them for what he can. If it's Eddings that was dropped from Del Rey for a lackluster story, then I will be thinking hard about purchasing any other series. Which is really too bad..."
1,Painful to Read,"I have always thought David Eddings was the best fantasy writer ever and would vehemently argue this point with everyone. I bought the second two books of this series with the expectation each time that they would be better than the first. I was extremely disappointed. I don't believe Eddings wrote these books! The writing style is awkward and the chapters don't flow well. Also, enough with the cute little phrases ""without a hint of a smile"" or ""with a faint smile"" or ""with a broad grin"" or ""so beat me"", which all seem to be painfully misplaced! The story line is great, but the writing style makes the book(s) difficult to read. In fact, the books are so awful that I doubt that I'll ever buy another Eddings book. My advice -- if you must buy it, wait for the paperback."
2,A Review of the Crystal Gorge,"When I first read the Pawns of Prophecy, it captured my imagination and I burned thru the rest of the Belgariad with an obsesive zeal. The day that Gaurdians of the West came out was one of the happiest days of my life. I thought that the Elenium and the Tamuli were equally good, though bearing a bit to much similarity to the Belgariad and the Mallorean. I am sad to say that I have found everything else by Mr. Eddings to be a downward slide into mediocrity - to the extent that while reading the Crystal Gorge, I mostly felt that I was wasting my time."
3,"Awful, but I have hope.","I agree with many of the other reviews that this book...well, let's just say I wouldn't use it to hold up my table if one leg was 2 inches short. The only reason I'm will to give book 4 a chance is that The elements of his writing which I assumed to be just him getting lazy are starting to turn into plot complications that should lead to infighting amongst the heroes. Now that would be something new from Eddings and would make his stuff more believable. I must say that up to now this series has been full of disappointing drivel, contrived dialogue, and awful cliches. He repeats things endlessly and for no apparent reason other than a pallid attempt at character development. This is not up to the standards I expect from an Eddings' Book. P.S. If I hear the expression, ""kiss-kiss"" one more time, I'll go insane."
2,taking time with d eddings,This new collection of books by the Eddings team is not one of the best. It is filled with redundancies and seems just an attempt to fill space with words to sell books but with out substance.
3,Walter,"Good story but cluttered with a lot of repetition.. If you can skip that, the humor and the characters make for fun reading."
4,Love Eddings.,"I love Eddings books but I must say this one is a little slow moving. I think this is because it is part of series of books that are split up to be stand alone stories. This means that there is a lot of repetition with constant reference to the previous story lines. This makes it slow going if you have read the previous two books. Overall, it is an interesting story line (once you get into it) with lots of lovable characters."
5,Madrigals and Wedding Songs for Diana,"This is one of my favorite albums! I had this album on ""LP"" and have been looking for it for a while!"
5,CAMOUFLAGE BEST OF CD + DVD,THIS IS BY FAR THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF THIS BANDS STELLAR WORK AND THE DVD PORTION IS TO DIE FOR. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU MUCH IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS. YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE BIG DEAL ABOUT CAMOUFLAGE IS! CHECK THIS ONE OUT FOR SURE.
2,Good quality. Awkward Shape.,"This glass is really good quality and I haven't broken any yet since I got it two years ago. However, it's a really awkwardly shaped glass where it's difficult to wash. I would stick to a wider opening glass."
2,Not the glass pictured,"Just an FYI -- the glass pictured here is not the ""Parma"" but the ""Michelangelo"" design by the same company. The difference is slight -- the actual Parma (which is what we got when we ordered from here) has a wider base than the one pictured. The actual Parma is fine, but not as light. (Compare them both next to each other at the Luigi Bormioli website.) I don't like it as much as the one pictured, particularly because we picked this because it looked slender enough that my (very small) hands could hold it comfortably, and some of that advantage is lost in the actual Parma."
1,THIS SUPPLIER IS MIS REPRESENTING THE ITEMS!! DO NOT BUY HERE...,"This supplier is sending ONE box, or ONE package NOT A CASE!! Seems like they are lying...Sick how they can do this, how many people will buy and not complain?Tisk Tisk!"
3,temporary fix only,Will stop a leak for awile. Make sure and clean surface before applying - read instructions
1,Item is fine - Shipper took 10 days to get it to me!,"Item is standard Permatex. Shipping took forever. I'd advise going to a local store. It was just something I remembered that I needed while I was on Amazon, so I ordered it.....then for the next 10 days I wouldn't buy it at a local store because I was expecting it ""the next day""."
