1,yikes,"The lead singer of this band is the former lead of Thug Murder which was a band I really dug. But upon listening to ONE SHOT ONE KILL by Last Target - all I can say is her vocals have gotten really bad. She ain't a great singer in the first place, but with Thug Murder there was a charm to it, whereas here it really ruins the album because the music itself is really catchy and good and she is hard to listen to with never on key and screaming voice. This album really killed it for me, I am not even going to give this band a second chance because this CD was really just that bad!"
4,Amazingly energetic!,"Last Target, Punk Rockers, hail from the Land of the Rising Sun - Japan. Lead Singer Ryoko used to be part of the duo, Thug Murder, who toured the USA in 2002.This amazingly energetic album starts off with the speedy Truth For You, one of the best songs on this album. Don't Shine Your Boots follows in the same vein, fast and furious.The pace does slow occasionally, as at the start of Teaching, but then explodes halfway through into another full throttle punk anthem. This song is definitely the highlight of the album. Ikuji also slows the pace right down, another excellent song.Although the songs are sung in a mixture of English and Japanese, it didn't bother me too much as the music is off a pretty high standard.These Guys (and Girl) must have been bottlefed on a mixture of Sex Pistols with a dash of Sham 69!"
2,Too many typos,The content is OK. The book has way too many typos however that it might drive some readers crazy.
4,Good pacifiers...,"The pacifiers are great. My little sister used a similar pair (Phillips Avents 0-3 mos) when she was a baby and she loved them. I just bought a pair for my baby and the reason I rated this item 4 stars is because the cover in one of them came broken. There's no way it broke on its way to my house because it came inside a hard plastic box, it's factory broken.I recommend this item, but be careful."
4,Not the Movie listed in the other review,"i own this movie it stars Bruce Le (Bruce Lee imposter) also stars Bolo Yeung, Bruce Le's sister gets killed by Japanese these Chinese what him to go to this tower to get these documents at first he declines but then agrees, each floor of the tower holds a better and better Martial Artist till he gets to the top one bites the head off a snake. very good movie highly recommend just dont confuse it with the movie listed in other review , the movie pictured is my review."
5,satisfied,The product arrived in excellent shape. The music has a catchy sound to it. The interpretation of me and my partners song was excellent.Thank you
2,Just OK......,"Not to knock the ""Down Under"" Psychedlic scene..not knowing/hearing much from Australia during this era, but when I saw 27 tracks listed I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was somewhat disappointed as I found, unlike a previous reviewer, quite a bit of filler. Australia unfortunately was not an undiscovered gem of a scene that is being discovered and finally being exposed to the world. I could hear 3 quality songs; Eastern Dream, Magic Eyes, and Sitting by a Tree...about 4 other tunes would start out with promise..but then take a quick left turn off the road into deserved obscurity.."
2,Wild Card,A lot of well known TV stars are wasted with a lousy script. Not recommended unless you are coming here as a fan of one of the stars or for some other reason. Otherwise rather standard TV fare that isn't lifted by its array of well known actors.
1,returned,"I did not like this vacuum at all and already returned it. I have a child with asthema, and the return air was so much more than my old vacuum and it was also very hot air that came out. It did not work on my living room rug, it would just skip across the rug, very hard to control. very disappointed in this vacuum."
1,Avoid this vacuum!,"I purchased this vacuum less than 6 months ago and it is already useless. About 2 months ago, the Turbo Brush attachment (which was wonderful at first) stopped working completely. Unfortunate, but the vacuum still worked nicely. Currently, I vacuumed my whole house and smelled that familiar hot smell and thought I was burning through a belt. Not so. Upon opening the bottom of the vacuum I found that the beater bar had caused so much friction with the vacuum casing that it burned through 2 layers of plastic casing on the vacuum unit. It cannot be repaired and Bissell customer service won't do anything despite it being under warranty. I am taking the unit back to the store where I purchased it for a refund!"
4,Great vacuum,"I've only used this vacuum a few times but I am very pleased so far. I did notice at first a little difficulty pushing it on carpet at times, but I think changing the carpet height adjustment helped that. Most of the time it glides across carpet easily. It has great suction and is only a little noisy, much quieter than my last vacuum. Overall I am very happy with this vacuum. Now I don't mind vacuuming!"
5,BRAVO BISSELL! IT'S LOVE AT FIRST SWIPE!!!!!!,KEEP YOUR DYSON AND OTHER OVER PRICED WONDERS THIS VACUUM IS THE BEST!!THIS IS MY SECOND BISSELL IN ONLY 8 YEARS. I WANTED THE POWER AND RELIABILITY OF THE FIRST MODEL BUT FOUND THAT THE BAGLESS MODEL WAS REALLY TOO MUCH WORK TO KEEP CLEAN AS THE MOTORS ON THESE UNITS REALLY GET ALL THE TINY STUFF YOU DON'T SEE BUT ADDS UP. WITH THIS BAG UNIT I JUST HAVE TO OPEN AND THROW IT AWAY.THERE ARE WONDERFUL AND USEFUL ON-BOARD ATTACHMENTS AND THAT SEXY LITTLE STAIR SWEEPER THAT MAKE CLEANING LESS OF A CHORE.NO CONTACT WITH THE ALLERGY CAUSING STUFF AND LITTLE MAINTENANCE.BRAVO BISSELL!!!
4,"So far, so good","I have had great results using this vacuum in my small loft. It even works on my kitchen's wood floor, and doesnt't choke and blow dust if it sucks up a coin or hairpin. Maybe I got too used to the old, heavy, crappy vacuum I used to have, but this one feels quite luxurious. If vacuuming can be luxurious.And it's a nice color, too."
5,Wonderful!,"This vacuum pulled every bit of dust, lint, dog hair, and debris from my rugs. I love it! I'm not an allergy sufferer but my dogs are. When I used this product, their little sneezes stopped along with their constant scratching. And you can't beat the price. Most vacuums that pick up at all are really expensive. This vacuum is inexpensive and gets the job done plus some. Thanks Bissell!"
4,great vacuum,"I purchased this vacuum a couple weeks ago after checking out reviews on consumer reports, epinions, and amazon. The powerglide is awesome; very good on carpeting and on bare floors. Its not as heavy as most vacuums I checked out in the stores, it's not too loud, has very good suction and it seems to be a pretty solid well built unit. I really like the hepa filtration system on it; nice clean smell when u get done vacuuming. The only thing that would make this vacuum cleaner perfect would be a switch to turn the roller/brush off and a better way of attatching the wand into the base; its just a little awkward . Great vacuum for 79.00"
2,Design problems,"The HEPPA filter housing does not have a clamp to keep it shut. The force of the blower sent it flying open, popping the filter out every time. I finally had to take strapping tape to keep it shut. Also, there is apparent trouble sucking stuff from the wand into the bag. I have to use the wand around the cat litter box. After doing this the first day, I went to use the vacuum the 2nd day. I pushed on it a bit in trying to move it and everything I had vacuumed the first day came out onto my bathroom floor. Poorly made. However, it did one thing well - it did vacuum the carpet well."
3,Deep sleep issues,"I bought this product to upgrade my aging PowerMac dual 450 G4. The card works perfectly for USB 2.0 but when I try to put the computer to sleep with a peripheral plugged in, the computer will not sleep. Apparently there were only a handful of USB 2.0 cards that will work correctly (allow sleep with peripheral plugged in) with the older macs. This isn't one of them. So if you're buying this for an older Mac you may want to keep looking."
2,Not for Some Macs,"This has never worked correctly on my 1GHz (Mirrored Drive Door) PowerMac, no matter which version of Mac OS X I've used (10.3 - 10.4.9 and every revision between). The system has ongoing problems with sleep and deep sleep when this card is inserted. Despite the packaging claims and the instructions in the manual, the CD-ROM does not come with any drivers for Mac OS X. It's my understanding that these problems are limited to the MDD PowerMac."
5,"It works, it's inexpensive, and it has more ports than competition.","Plug this card into your computer and you're all set to add USB devices. Windows will easily recognize this component. You can also add an internal component, such as a 9-in-1 card reader or USB drive, due to the fifth plug on the rear of the card.Have not required service, so I cannot comment on the company's product support.Highly recommended."
1,Compatibility?,"I was about to order this item, seeing all the positive reviews... It seemed odd that their was no system requirements or compatibility... The bad reviews are mostly for customers who tried to install card with older operating systems or Windows 7. I would think a Windows 7 computer would have plenty of USB Ports - if the driver that comes with the card was dated 2004, what does that tell you about Windows 7.My point is, this is all Amazon's fault for not publishing compatibility on the page with the item."
1,LOCKS UP,The whole computer locks up!!! Can't open any program or look at the device manager.To shut down I have to use the power supply switch.The XP install wizard doesn't open defiantly not plug & play.I called tech service the driver on they're site is the same one on the CD which is dated 4-2004.
5,Great Product,"Cheap, easy to install, and works great. What more can you ask for? This is great for anyone looking to get an upgrade to USB 2. It made transferring pictures, music, etc. to and from my computer 20x faster."
5,"Plugged it in, worked just fine...","It has four ports, perfect for all my peripherals. Works wonderful with Windows XP and Windows XP 64-bit."
2,Made my computer lock-up,"It seemed a nice way to add USB ports, with good power, and without another thing dangling around the computer. It installed easily and worked for a few minutes, until my computer locked up. Tried drivers, etc. and still had same problem. I've got a ""home built"" computer that maybe has something that just wouldn't work properly with it. AMAZON was GREAT about returning it, so it's worth trying and if it works on your computer it's probably a great unit."
4,Good Expansion for Older Systems at a Good Price,If you'd like to get more life out of your USB 1.1 system this is a good card to get. It adds USB 2 ports and speed at a good price. It installed easily and has worked well.
4,Vendor Connections Sends VIA equivalent XP issues,"The vendor contacted promptly to insure I knew this was not IOgear. Didn't bother me. Arrived promptly. XP did not detect and install. Installation CD has not autoplay. It's working now, but do not buy from Connections if you are a Novice installer."
3,Product works fine; packaging s*cks,No problem installing this device and it seems to work well. The plastic packaging is really obnoxious - difficult to open and sharp. I scratched my hand struggling to open it.
3,USB 2.0 card,"The IO card was easy to install. Start to finish in ten minutes. It works with printers, GPS, wireless hardware and card readers."
1,Worst packaging Ever! Caused bleeding,"This is the worst packaging ever. I received the card fast from Amazon as I normally do, but whoever's asinine decision it was to package this card the way it was packaged should be FIRED. In an attempt to open up this thick plastic, not only did I get a deep cut into my skin, causing bleeding, but I also damaged the card. I've never experienced this and I will not buy this card again.My previous card, which did not work (it was Windows XP compatible, not 7), came in a box. It was easy to open. Seriously, WHAT THE HELL, IOGEAR??"
2,USB Keyboard won't work through this device.,"This device works ok, but my USB keyboard will not work through it. Strange.... Everything else seems to work fine. The USB ports themselves are kind of cheap and it may be wise to be gentle with it. However, I think it is a good buy for the money if you can get everything to work."
4,Fast - but incompatible with WD Passport,"I bought this to speed up the connection to a 1TB Western Digital ""Book"" drive. And it increased my transfer speed to SATA drives in the system by about 30% - 50%.And the extra ports are nice, but these USB ports apparently don't supply enough power to run a WD Passport drive. It does work with other USB-Powered devices, so I'm guessing the HDD just pulls too much current.Other than that, I'm very happy with it."
4,great product,Prosgreat product if you are upgrading to USB 2.0 or just needing more USB slots. A+ConsA little on the pricy side
4,USB port adon,It has 5 USB ports but I can only access 4 of them. I don't have a clue as to why they made the 5th. an internal port? It was suggested to by a Dell tech. I loved the price.
5,IOGEAR,Great product. Once installed in the back of the computer. Detected easily. Using XP pro. Recomend if your computer running out of USB connection on the back.
4,Works great in my Dell Dimension 8200,"I was a little worried about putting this card in my PC as a couple other reviewers had problems with card recognition in a Dimension. However, this card worked great for me on the first try, I am very happy with it. However, the fact that it is called 5-port is a little deceiving, it actually has 4 external ports, and one internal port which is completely useless for me. Other than that I would have given 5 stars."
5,"installation was a ""snap"" -- actually 2","Pop open the case, pop in the card, close the computer. Works fine. With xp you do not need to install any drivers. I am concerned that this one, unlike the the Belkin, does not require a supplemental power supply. but it seems to work fine. and you cannot beat the price."
3,IOGear 5 port USB 2.0 - Mac deep sleep issue,"The card installed easily into my G4 tower, and USB devices work fine. However, the card does not support deep sleep on the Mac with OSX 10.4.2, which is not reflected in the listing or advertising. The G4 requires a hard restart every time it goes into deep sleep (fans and drives powered down) with the card installed."
1,Stay Away If you have Windows 7,This will not work with Windows 7. I called IOGear and they confirmed that there are no DRIVERS for Windows 7. What a waste of time.
1,Did not work with Dell Inspiron 546,This product did not work with Dell Inspiron 546 (Windows XP SP3)! I tried it in both PCI slots. Each time it installed fine. It worked with one USB device plugged in. Each time I plugged in a second USB device the computer froze. It would not reboot until I took the PCI USB card out. I contacted IOGEAR. They advised me to return the USB PCI Card. I took this to mean that it was either defective or they did not really know why it was incompatible with the Dell Inspiron 546. I installed a Belkin 5-port USB 2.0 PCI Card today (part number F5U220v1). It works perfectly.
5,5 stars so far,"I bought this based on the reviews here and the price.I did a lot of research on how to replace a usb card.I was told to remove the old card but the old usb was actually attached to the motherbosrd and not in a pci slot.(Gateway, intel III, 996MHz, 512MB ram., XP Home(service pack 2))I saw some caveats on removing usb 1 drivers before installing the new one but I didn't do it.When I got it, I just put it into the open pci slot and restarted.I got a few messages as it recognized each usb device and then it just worked.No problems at all, so far."
2,Beware of Conflicts,"Because I use a USB hard drive and SuperDuper to back up my Quicksilver G4 Mac, I wanted to save myself 3 days by using the faster USB 2. My USB 2 computer backs up in 3 hours, the G4 takes 3 days. I bought the IOGEAR Hi-Speed USB 2.0 PCI Card (GIC251U) and installed it. I had another PCI card installed to let the G4 recognize a larger hard drive I had installed. The IOGEAR Card froze the computer and destroyed the other PCI card, which means that second hard drive is no longer available to my G4. Considerable loss. Make sure you investigate thoroughly for conflicts with software and hardware."
1,Don't buy this card from 3B Tech,"I ordered this card from 3B Tech, through Amazon. They mailed me a generic one instead. I have learned a lesson. I will never order from them again. Just a reminder: BEWARE!"
1,IO Gear USB PCI card,The vendor substituted a CHEAP Via card without permission and has not responded to two email asking for the card tha I ordered.AVOID this vendor!
5,WELL DOCUMENTED LOOK AT SERIAL OFFENDERS AND THEIR MOTIVATIO,STEVENS INTERVIEWED IN PRISON A SPECIFIC KIND OF OFFENDER--A SERIAL ATTACKER OF WOMEN. HE OUTLINES THE VARIED MOTIVATIONS AND SOP OF THE RAPISTS( THEY RANGE FROM SIMPLY LOONY TO BRILLANT STALKERS). THIS TYPE OF CRIMINAL EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO APPREHEND UNLESS THEY BECOME LAZY AND SMUG IN THEIR DEPRADATIONS. STEVENS GOOD ON MOTIVATIONS AND EARLY FAMILY LIFE OF THESE MEN. VERY USESFUL CJ/POLICE COURSES.
4,Inside their minds.,"I started reading this book as soon as I got it. Dennis goes straight into the minds of the rapists', letting them tell their stories, and I liked that. However, I thought I was ordering this book because I thought it was a book about ONE serial rapist and what crimes he comitted, this book turned out ok. Detailed, right from the mouths of the offenders. He makes you understand what rape is about.All in all, I would have to say this is a good book. If your offended by dirty or sexual words, then this book isn't for you. You can really know what is on their minds when you read what they say."
1,This book doesn't deserve any stars at all,"I've been ordering books from amazon for many years, and no matter how much I liked or disliked them, I have never felt strongly enough to actually sit down and write a review. All that changed with this book. It is a complete waste of the pages it was written on. Never have I read such garbage. Apparently the author teaches law-enforcement officers. I guess that explains why so many have absolutely no empathy for victims of rape. The author's opinions in this book truly do a disservice to victims everywhere. Survivors, do not waste your money on this book. You will regret it."
1,Amazing waste of time,"Look, the ""author"" starts politicizing in the very book description, saying the book isn't for ""weak-hearted liberals."" So what does that mean, all rapists are republicans? The author doesn't even know the difference between the words ""device"" and ""devise."" Exercise your rights in the free market and leave this one on the store shelf."
5,pleasant surprise,"very nice looking watch, band fit perfectly,whole dial lights up with a push of a button, delivered as promised, great price"
2,NO HEAT IN THIS ONE,"Hampered by sophomoric special effects, a limp script and an uninspired cast, COMBUSTION is a disappointment. Joe Lando (Dr. Quinn) stars as a city engineer who believes deadly gases are somehow being released into the city's underground sewer system, resulting in deadly fires and deaths. Greeted with skepticism by the egotistical fire chief (Michael Gregory, overacting shamefully), Lando must convince the mayor and everyone that he is right. Of course, a greedy oil baron (Michael Gross, looking woefully embarrassed) is the one responsible for the gas releases, but he doesn't want Lando to uncover this. A subplot involves Lando's troubled marriage to Gabrielle Carteris and their son's involvement with the daughter of Lando's old flame, who is now a newscaster(Susan Walters). Directed with little regard for common sense or pacing, COMBUSTION fizzles instead of sizzles."
4,It's a little better then okay.,This movie is about a family man who tries to save a town from these mysterious fires. The movie has a good acting but not as good writing. If you are one of those people who likes a little mystery and family strife in a movie you will like this.
5,Combustion,exciting and very probable--it could happen. I loved the way he cared for his family in this crisis and also the way he took his job so seriously.
5,The title says it well,"""Combustion"" stars Joe Lando; that is why I bought it. Not really into this type film, but it's real good. Lots of action, nice effects. Joe steps out of his 'romantic lead' type here, & does a great job. Give it a look....."
1,not closed captioned as listed,I bought this only because it said it was closed captioned and we can't watch movies without words due to hearing problems which resulted in us wasting our money on the movie.
5,Absolutely fantastic,I just started reading this book to my two year old daughter two weeks ago and now she is beginning to use the potty for all the right reasons! I recommend this book to any parent!
3,opposite effect,my child is now proud of wearing diapers. the first line in the book is --Do you wear diapers?-- my kid laughs and says yes and pats his diaper. He doesn't relate to her dislike of diaper rash or having to sit in it when mommy doesn't have time to change it. Also this book talks about diaper pins and tape which is outdated even for cloth diaper users. So this book has had the opposite effect by no error of the writers; I didn't expect that reaction when i bought it! Really is probably a decent book for every other child in the world
2,Not as appeared,"Seems like a high quality bag. But the color was not as appeared/described online. I was expecting a deep orange; it was a true red. Also, the straps were connected toward the top, in a ""H"" formation. I'm sure that served a purpose, but it made the bag sit awkwardly on my shoulders.I returned the bag."
3,Not an advanced physics course!,"This CD-ROM is a PART 2 of Physics 1!!! Not an advanced course in physics concepts. The interface was ""game-like"" but childish for a teen to use. The small price for unreturnable software is the only reason I am not upset....buyer beware."
3,A good read but is was too general,"It was a good book but it was too general. The book should have covered more on the different aspects of grooming, different inherited defects the cocker spaniel can have and how you can pick them at the puppy stage. I liked how it had examples of the cockers behaviour from personal experience. Overall it was a good book."
3,Looks good.,"Typical shiny polished aluminum. Looks great on the truck. However. The ends were bent wrong. Not a bad fix. The instructions say drill the screws in from the top, but has holes drilled in the lip that overhangs inside. Stake holes lined up well. For what I paid, I suppose they're ok."
5,Exceptional Cookware,"This item can be used for a large number of recipies, not just lasagna. I usually cook for two and the size is perfect. I love all the Emile Henry quality products and plan to add to my collection. The heat conductivity is perfect for maximum quality baking."
3,Cumbersome read,"There are sometimes when one would like for RKN to continue the tangential descriptors. This story did not evoke any such feelings for me and for the best part Gandhi's appearances kept interrupting the flow which looking back was exactly how Sriram, the protagonist must have felt. Only an RKN fan would recommend this."
4,Vintage Narayan,"For those familiar with, and in tune with Narayan's style, this book is a wonderful and funny read. I actually found it difficult to put down, a surprising statment for the kind of books Narayan writes. Narayan's style is deceptively simple as he follows ordinary people through their lives and reveals their thoughts and motivations. My life (and I would presume, that of most people living in the modern world) is more complicated and my motivations more nuanced. Still I feel that the stories contain some deep understanding of human life. It is a paradox I can't figure out."
3,Beware When Washing,"In these days of colorfast fabrics, it is a surprise to find a product for which this is not the case. These shop towels are described as washable, but they are very definitely not colorfast, and thus should not be washed with other items. Fortunately, I didn't find this out the hard way."
3,"Good, not necessary, but useful.","Chaining the Beast was an ambitious undertaking by WW. They attempted to take all of the before listed Paths of Enlightenment and update them for the newer Revised Edition of Vampire. They are successful in doing so, and they even resurrected a few from the Dark Ages games that come in handy for those interested.Personally, I found all of the above to be interesting, and handy to have in one book. The real gem for me was in the first chapter. Here the authors sought to explain the experiences of changing from a (basically) ""human"" vampire into a truly alien being.As this was the first such attempt, I found it an excellent addition to any Story Tellers library and have used it on my own players to help them understand what their PC's where going through as they desperately sought a new philosophy to keep the Beast at bay."
1,Anti-Hero,"'Caroline was found of her young charge, Richard. She took her responsibilities seriously. Not surprising, then, in Lisbon, that she clashed head on with Vasco Duarte de Capuchos-a determined man who had his own ideas on children and governesses.'"
1,Make sure you get what you order,"I orderedOriginal Tush Cush Seat Cushion - Large Navy Bluesold by ""The Ink Link"" and fulfilled by Amazon. Instead of the 14""x18"" original Tush Cush that's listed, they sent me the 13""x15"" Car-Cush instead. Amazon took the return easily enough, but if you order this, make sure you get what you ordered."
2,Very Firm,This cushion is very firm. Not what I was looking for unfortunately. It is also very short. It doesn't cover the entire seat of my chair.
2,tush cush,"I ordered the original tush cush after reading all the reviews thought it would be the correct one and there was no need to order the xxlg. Well it was way to short and only came up half of my upper leg. the concept and cushion seemed nice for driving long distances. sent it back for full refund, have not decided if I want to order the xxlg or not. Be sure to measure and see how it fits your ""tush"" before ordering. I have tried many different cushions and hope the right one is still out there somewhere!!!"
1,Waste of money,"This product is nothing but a piece of foam - any cheap piece of foam would do the same for you. When you sit on it it feels great - for about 10 seconds, it then turns completely flat. The ""wedge"" is a joke because it is so flat.The only reason I did not return it is because the shipping costs are also ridiculously high and they also have a restocking fee."
5,Great book,"This was a christmas present for my son. He really liked it. He heard about Joe Hill at a Joan Baez concert, and wanted to know more about him."
4,Quality pie dish,"My pyrex pie dishes are 30 years old and beginning to have chips on the rims, so I began a search for new pie dishes. After reading reviews of the ""new"" pyrex products, I am reluctant to stay with the pyrex that has served me so well. I love the colors available in this product and have enjoyed cooking with this type of cookware over the years so I decided to go with Emile Henry. The crusts are possibly a little less flaky than my usual crusts, and are not as brown on the bottom, but the overall result was still outstanding and drew no criticism from my tasters. I expect that after using this dish a few times the results will be indistinguishable. The dish is easy to clean and I especially enjoy the fact that I don't have to fear an explosion (and the resulting mess) in my oven when I bake. I would purchase this dish again."
4,Pie Plate,Gave this pie plate as a Christmas present after seeing it reviewed on Twin Cities Live in November. The Chef who gave the review said that absolutely every one should have one in their kitchen.
3,Got it as a christmas present,My sister said red. This cheaper version isn'tred inside like the good kind and she was dissapointed. Y y y
5,Exquisite,"Initially I added this to my Wish List because I thought it was beautiful. I was fortunate enough before I bought this to come across an 8 inch version of it in red at a Williams-Sonoma outlet for $10. Knowing how expensive this one was, I had to pick it up. I was immediately thrilled with the quality that I pulled out of the oven with the first pie I baked in it. After seeing just how lovely and functional Emile Henry bakeware is, I came back to Amazon and bought the larger pie dish in white.The quality is stunning and I can't say enough about how beautiful it is. The addage is true that you get what you pay for, and in the case of Emile Henry it is a tradition of craftsmanship. Somehow the form and function of this pie dish just seems to make already good pies taste so much better."
2,"Not bad - but ""CNN-style"" rather than academic",Maria's book is well researched (although at times highly questionable ; as in her assertion that the OKC bombing may have been linked to Al Qaeda). Her style is a little too much a reflection of her work at CNN - lots of hyperbole and drama and use of the first person. On the whole a fast read that offers some insights amid a lot of self-back patting.
2,"Interesting interviews, shoddy analysis","JI is an active terrorist organization, but there just aren't many of them and their influence on Indonesian society is quite small. However, Ressa makes a number of sloppy connections as she tries to argue otherwise. Though the Ba'asyir interview has some fascinating tidbits, this book by and large reads like an audition for Fox; few people with any expertise or experience in Indonesia lend it much credence."
5,"so you want to know what is happening with Islamic Jihad, start here!","This woman should have been listened to years ago. Why is it that our USA media refuses to develope stories as she was writing. Along with Robert Baer, Ahmad Rashid and now Miss Peters who has a book of the same name someone should give this woman and her information a Cronkite Award!!"
3,Better Than The Last One,"I really didn't enjoy the last book in this series much, so I was glad to find this one a much better read.The thing I didn't like about this one was how wimpy Josie seemed. Her parents left her when she was a child, but she never stood up to them about it...she just kept going along meekly with whatever her mother said or wanted. She never stood up to her grandmother about cutting her off from the family. And she never stood up to Owen for basically ending their relationship, instead talking and acting like they were still a couple.I'd like to see Josie grow a backbone in future installments, and stop allowing herself to be everyone's doormat."
4,IMPORTANT STUDY ON ROYAL EGYPTIAN ART,"Anyone interested in ancient Egyptian art must read this title: although limited to the first four reigns of the XVIIIth dynasty, it presents a wealth of material from sculpture to jewellery, a so-well researched documentation and so many provocative insights and comments, that you will find it useful and instructing. Each sculpture from the aforesaid reigns are described, compared and researched fully. Fundamental."
4,Great DVD Player!,"I recently purchased a 50"" plasma TV and wanted better picture from my DVDs. This is it! The picture from this player is so much better than I was getting from my old DVD player. I own DVD players that are S-Video as well as 480 composite video, and neither of them even come close. The only problem I have had is that DVDs that I recorded on my DVD recorder must have a slightly different audio format because they won't play audio over the digital audio output on this unit. I solved that problem though by turning on the HDMI audio output when I am playing these DVDs and it works fine. All in all, a great unit and I got it at a great price as well!"
1,Sick of the tricks,"I have had it with consumer malipulation! I have Yamaha's HTR-5560 receiver and it is a nice one but my Sony DVD just crapped out on me and I bought a Yamaha DV-S5950 as a replacement. Clue, the DVD player's ONLY digital audio output is component (RCS plug), the Yamaha's ONLY component digital audio input is assigned to the CD component - the rest, including DVD is optical. What the %$#@!SO, let me guess, every other year they switch from optical to component inputs so we'll buy a matched pair.While I'm ranting, lets' talk about BlueRay vs. HD, HDMI and PlayAlways. When are we just going to give up on these people and let them know what we really feel about this blatant manipulation!"
4,can be made less protruding,idea is good but the male usb part can be made more discreet as this adapter sticks out too much.
3,A bit flimsy,"This is okay to keep in your backpack, but I prefer theTripp Lite U005-10I USB Right Angle Gold Extension Cable A-F/M(90deg) - 10init's much more sturdy."
3,Does what it is supposed to.,This usb cable adapter allows you to bend in two directions so that you can get into hard to reach places. While it does allow you to adjust to a wide variety of angles it is not low profile. I wanted to use this adapter to make a right angle and fit into a tight spot. While it worked it stuck out further than expected. If you are looking for a 90 degree angle you would be better off getting a 90 degree cable.
3,Only One Drawback,"This is a very handy little device, the almost perfect answer to the problem of making usb connections in tight places or where sharp turns are required. I use one to plug a usb light in so that I can see my keyboard more easily in dark areas. It works great. The one real drawback to the device is that it is quite easy to break an internal wire if it moves very often. But since it works so well for its intended purpose, is relatively inexpensive, and most importantly, there doesn't seem to be anything else available that does the same thing, my advice would be to buy several spares and always keep a couple of extras handy."
5,Performs as advertised,"This item can be indispensable for laptop users who need, for instance, a propietary USB key to make one or more of their software packages fully functional. In the absence of this adapter, if such a USB key breaks, productivity can come to a screeching standstill until it can be replaced. This particular item fared much better for me than the three (less expensive) off-brand adapters I bought. Of those three, one was completely (electronically) non-functional. Pay more for the Belkins!"
2,What a joke...and im not...,"Father vs daughter ??? its like Diesel vs bob backlund ...do u remember this one?This entire PPV made me laugh ,not a good match excepted... may be for the confrontation between...thanks to Benoit and Angle... whatever...Even Lance Storm would not have been boring at this show.Hope excellence for the next events...because i tell u separating the Raw and Smackdown brand was a real big mistake"

3,BUY IT ON VIDEO!,"I was an avid buyer of all WWE Event DVDs. For the past year I have bought all the events whether it be a SD! or RAW Brand PPV. I was satisfied with all the DVDs I purchased and believed that they were well worth the $25.00 on average that they would cost me. That all changed with the release of Vengeance. I found that there were no special features. I ask a question, if not for the special features then why purchase a wrestling DVD?The matches on this PPV were off the chain, but it remains a matter of value for cash situation. I say that you should definately buy NO MERCY, the McMahon match was great, along with the Cena and Angle match, but you should buy it on video because you will be getting the same stuff but cheaper!"
4,look into the Crystal Ball,"Brock Lesnar vs The undertaker In a Biker cahin Match My prediction is Taker takes the gold.Stephanie vs vince in father daughter I Quit match: I'm going with vinny macA-train vs benoite: I have a felling trains gonna f this match up: i say benoiteEddy g. vs the big show Us TITLE MATCH: i think this will be the best match i say big show winsMysterio 619vs tagire crusierweight title match: Tagire winsMatt hardy vs Zack Gowen: I'm going with the one legged wonder zack gowenKurt Angle vs John Cena: My Boy from Boston's gonna take this one home baby ""cena""I also predict Nathan Jones will make his return"
3,Just an average PPV,"No Mercy PPV Results- A-Train defeats Chris Benwah in a hair match- Tarijri defeats Rey Mysterio in a ladder match- Big Show defeats Eddie Guerero & Chavo Guereero after Bigslow shoves Eddie into his @ s s- Matt Hardy defeats Zech Gowan after a single-leg crab to make Zach submit- Mark Jindreik & Garrrison Cade defeat The Dudleyz, Kane & Linda McMahon, La Resistance, Triple HHH & Maven, RVD & Brat Hart, Worlds Greatest Tag Team, and Hulk Hogan & Mr. America in a elimination tag team tables match to win the titles- Kurt Angle defeats Chris Jericho, John Cena, Christian, & Giant Gonzalez in a crybaby match- Shane McMahon defeats Brock Lesnar & Undertaker to win the WWE Championship- Vince McMahhon defeats Stephanie McMahhon after he pops Stephanie's implants- Tommy Dreammer defeats Greeenberg to win the World TitleNo Mercy was an alright PPV if you want a better one you should buy BadddBloddd 2003"
2,NOT AGAIN!!!!,"This PPV is just bad as the Movie:Sidekicks. The lowpoint of this show was the ""I Quit"" match between VKM & Stephanie McMahon which also allow Step to pin him for the 3 count making it the worst ""I Quit"" match ever. a true ""I Quit"" match does not allow pin falls in this type of contest. That match was crazy and I saw the The 4 Doinks-Team Bigelow match at SS 1993. The Matt Hardy-Zack Gowen match is no better. The wrestling & the ending of that match are laughable in a bad way like a Ed Wood film. The Undertaker-Brock Lesnar match while not a bad match it failed to live up to thier 2002 HITC fight. I mean a biker chain match? What is this the 1980's? and VKM's run-in to help Brock made it worse. The US title match between Big Show & Eddie Guerrero was sad & pitiful. The ONLY good matches were the Kurt Angle-John Cena bout & The A-Train-Chris Benoit fight which both were good solid matches but bottom line it's still a bad PPV. I give this show a 4 out of 10."
2,When Vince almost hit the jackpot with Sable in bed!,This is a good ppv and for this dvd I will give it a rating from A-FA Great.Keep forever.B.Good but not excellent.Let someone borrow it for a week until you think of it again.C.Good but boring.D.Sell on ebay with the starting bid at 99 cent.F.Take a number 2 on it.Then flush it down the toilet.To me this video had its ups and downs.I liked some of the matches like Eddie Gurrerro vs Big Show for the U.S title John Cena vs Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar vs The Undertaker in a biker chain match for the wwe title.Overall Review I would give this dvd a high C for effort.P.S Could of been better if it had Stephanie vs Sable in a buck naked match with the both of them making out afterwards.
1,"Sturdy outside, crappy inside (or maybe just a crappy power supply)","I bought a USB Firewire combo Metal Gear Box: Substance 2 loaded with a Seagate 320. It lasted one month before slowly dying. First symptoms were flaky behavior, crashes, drive not recognized. Then the blue LED light started dying. Now the drive isn't recognized. After searching the web for advice I discovered several user reviews at various sites. The main complaint focusses on the power supply, which in one user's case caught fire while plugged in but not in use. I suspect my problem is also the power supply. Another ""consumer treat"" made in China. I'm going to try to salvage the hard drive. If it works in another unit I'll know for sure what the problem is. It was a new drive. Hopefully it'll work and if so I'll investigate to see if a better power supply will work with this unit.It's a good sturdy case. Too bad the guts seem to be substandard.I'd steer clear of this unit and other products by this company."
1,"Power supply failures, company ignores consumer","when a product like this has such massive failure due to cutting corners they need to make ammends or go out of business. Clearly many customers are having power supply failure in about a year, just long enough for them to be free of warranty responsibility."
1,My computer can't see it.,"After six month of use, my computer can't see the hard drive in this enclosure. I tried it on three different computers with the same outcome. I used a different enclosure with the same HD just to make sure it is not the HD that I am having a problem with, HD checked out ok. Also, I am using a 250GM HD in this enclose and it is a really tight fit."
3,Sheet set,"I am just not sure about this product. Sheets are a jersey material with a very light ""go team' inprinted. I am hoping when I wash the sheets and print will soften, otherwise its going to feel rough to lay on because of the print. Pillows are standard size but they look like they would fit a king size pillow. Not loving this product. Seems very cheaply made."
1,Lame tid bits from the sidelines,"I am not sure what book the other reviewer was reading but it could not have been this book. This is a very light look at the Ravens. Nothing new is presented and the stories are oddly devoid of interest for one of the most colorful teams in the NFL. Very little research or effort was taken to come up with the so called tales. The musing from Tom Matte are just that, musing from off the top of his head. He probably jotted them down one afernoon, at least thats how it seems. The book although written for a middle schooler would not interest one. If you want a good Baltimore football book buy an old paperback copy of Fatso by Artie Donovan. Now he is someone who knows how to spin a tale."
5,"THIS, is real hip-hop","Now THIS is what hip-hop should sound like. Beats by Evidence, babu, E-swift, Kutmaster Kurt, and most notably, Alchemist, compliment Evidence and Iriscience perfectly.NOw, for all of you people who can only listen to rap about killing, drugs, and sex over corny, commercial beats, go cop something else. But If you wanna listen to some conscience, hungry lyrics from Evidence (some people don't like his voice, BUt I think it cuts through a track perfectly, plus he has the better lyrics), and Iriscience( has the better flow of the two) plus real street beats like Expanding Man, Ear drums pop, service, etc, then go cop this. It's a couple years old and I still can't stop listening to it. GO COP IT!"
4,Dilated In Da House,"Getting into the undergound scene through J5 (Check out there new album Quality Control its tight!) Dialted are the next thing to come out and how shout they loud. This album is da bomb from the start, the flow of the MCs are just the best and the beats which babu pumps out are just dope!Stand out tracks are Annilation, Triple Optics and The Last Line Of Defense!But in truth the whole album is tight, if you love the undergound sound and flow, check this out!"
4,"More than Solid, Less than Spectacular","Dilated Peoples waited to sign with a major label until they were sure that they would have absolute creative control and it shows on ""The Platform."" There's no doubt that this is the album that they wanted to put it. However, as I suggest in the title, this album isn't quite groundbreaking. There is no doubting the positives on this joint: Evidence and Iriscience can rock it with anyone and Babu freaking rips it on the 1's and 2's. But the only letdown is that there isn't much that is innovative here. They do what they do (which is creating dope hip hop that they want and not for the masses), and they excel at it, but I personally think that they have more in them, and I hope that it comes out in the future."
3,It isn't THAT great,"i tried to like the dilated peoples but i just can't. they're really just mediocre rappers with neat punchlines, you really can't hold a whole album like that. after a listen or two, once you know what they're saying the album then just becomes a collection of beats. the beats are great though (especially the platform and ear drums pop). the dilated peoples aren't for me. i'd suggest quality control by jurassic 5 over this."
2,Eek,"=( I came in late and everyone seems to have reviewed this very highly. Well, it's all solid rhymining and turntable cutting, but every song just sounds the same to me. I guess I'll learn to like it eventually..."
4,hip-hop makes a comeback,"i'm so glad this album came out because it reminds us of what hip-hop really is, ya'll can keep the mainstream, i remain subterrain"
2,not too thrilled,"item was nice,imperfect though. it took 3 weeks to get it from purchase date. too long."
1,Spalding 14147 Spalding Pro Serve Volleyball Set,Poorly made product. I put this volleyball net up for a party and the aluminum poles bent -- very flimsy and did not even hold up for one night of play. Sent this item back for a refund -- Very disappointed with the quality of the product. Not worth the money.
4,Cougar Club,"This is a hilarious movie. I loved this film...it has classic old school comedy like from Blake Edwards, but then it has contemporary super funny like from the Farrelly Brothers. Absolutely worth buying and having in your DVD collection!"
4,Solid construction w/dual suspension features provide great ride!,"Great deal on a solid full suspension bicycle from Mongoose that handles very well. The rear suspension mechanism feels very solid and is very comfortable for general or strenuous pedaling. The front and rear brakes are pretty solid and required very slight tweaking to balance them. GREAT handlebars with GREAT bar ends. Wish that the derailers were adjusted a little bit better out of the box, but functioned as expected. Seat post is tall enough for 6'0"" and under, so bicycle should fit most people easily. Wish the rear axle was quick release but the front is, so locking up the bicycle is easy.The only significant complaint that I had was the cheap pedals used. The metal ""teeth"" are sparse resulting in somewhat slippery petal performance, so you are forced to keep your feet close to the cranks to keep from slipping on hard pedalling. Otherwise no complaints!Great deal folks!!!"
4,Nice bike under $200,"Nice Frame and Wheels; light weight; take less than 15 minutes to assemble; The brake on the rear is kind of loose; The only problem is- I found out the front tire was flat before my first ride, there was a little hole on the inner tube, so I have to bought an inner tube from Kmart to replaced it, but over all, this is a great bike for the price under $200."
3,Things Just happen!,I bought this bike because the mongoose MGX was out of stock and the gas prices were rising. The only concern I had was that the bar handle became loose on my first ride. I had to walk the rest of the way! other than that the ride is smooth on the bike. 3 stars from ME...
1,Don't do it.,"I am giving this bike 1 star because Amazon doesn't allow anything less. If you are thinking about buying this bike, you would be better off going to a bike shop and spending 50 dollars more. The bike shops 250 dollar bike will be lighter weight, have better parts, and most of all will be more reliable. In the long run you will save money too. I guarantee that you will spend more on repairs of this bike than the initial cost at purchase. And, if you take a look at any of the other bikes on this site, well then remember this review; as it is true across the board."
1,Very narrow focus,"Book is great if you're1) installing a new headliner2) repairing a convertible top3) installing a new vinyl hardtop4) replacing apolstery5) replacing carpetanything else (dash, console, steering wheel and column, weatherstripping for instance) is either not or barely covered and the topics that ARE covered feature really poor b & w photo's that are generally taken from such a distance - that you can't see anything in them anyway.Book is basically an abridged version of selected sections of the 1964 1/2-1973 resotration guide - buy that one instead - about the same price and WAY more comprehensive"
3,Vague and Grainy,"This book contains ample photos and how-to's, but it needs an update. The photos are grainy and difficult to see. Also, it does not include interior options for the mustang. I would like to know what I am restoring my interior to look like. There are no color photos, no list of Mustang interior options (i.e. what's included in a 1967 deluxe interior vs the standard interior or pony interior).A novice restorer such as myself would be better served by a generic interior restoration book with color photos, although this book does include some helpful hints on removing dash components."
3,"not great, but definitely interesting","my one major problem with this book is pike's tendency to offer his opinion more than i would like. i would have rather read a book that chronicled the deaths of musicians without telling me which ones were talented and which were not. i am not a huge fan of queen, but i don't need pike to tell me that ""they weren't that good."" i can draw my own opinions, mr. pike. but for any readers who have the same fascination with rock'n'roll and death, and can ignore pike's commentary, i would certainly recommend this book."
4,Thought-Provoking,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I knew little of Fillmore and learned that he was an interesting, influential and very much underrated President. He was a more important political figure in his day than I realized. The constant intrigue with Weed was very interesting albeit very one-sided in the telling (I'm guessing Weed's biographer's would tell a different story about his and Fillmore's relationship). If you are looking for the best biography of Millard Fillmore, there's really no competition. Even if you are not, you will find this to be a well-written biography of an interesting man about whom very little is known in this day and age."
5,Great figure and Collectables Book,"This C3PO master edition displays very nicely. It includes a C3PO 12"" figure. The detail off the figure shines greatly, almost as if it were real gold. The book itself offers some wonderful insight on the Golden Droids collectables as well as character. The display case really brings this true peice of Star Wars artwork togehter. This would make a fantastic gift for any true Star Wars fan."
2,Confusing item picture,"When I saw item picture, it looked as full ""Tales of the Golden Droid"" box, with droid and book.It's not clear said that it's only book :-(So I bought it and what was my surprise and deception when I just received the book :-("
5,"It quickly brings you back to very sad reminder of a very sad time in our history, have we forgotten such times?","It quickly brings you back to very sad reminder of a very sad time in our history, have we forgotten such times? Would one not wonder why history has some very dark clouding that ""seems"" in some cases as a way to hide such times? Just a thought. The author gave brilliant pictorial of the heart ache and a very tender way of the only way that one could see themselves through such horror!"
5,"A glorious, life-changing first novel!","Sharon's insights are deep, rich, and honest. With uncanny accuracy, she climbs into the minds and hearts of her characters: young and old, male and female, black and white, rich and poor. This book isn't just about race, it's about grace in all it's amazing fullness. What a grand new voice Sharon brings to inspirational fiction!"
5,I've already bought two copies and plan to buy more. . .,"This book touched me deeply. If I had to explain racism to someone, I would use this book to do it. The book not only presents the problem eloquently, but it also presents the solution. It's not an easy book to read (from the heart's perspective) but I highly recommend it. I plan to give it as gifts. I've already bought two copies and plan to buy more."
2,Nice story...average craft,"I picked up the novel to give ""Christian fiction"" another shot. As usual, I was disappointed with the craft itself. The story depended on dialog too much to give a lot of information, quickly. Instead of allowing the plot and the characters' actions/descriptions etc. to ""show"" us...there was a ton of dialog to ""tell"" us. I mean pages connected to pages of just dialog.I managed to finish to see what happened, but thejourney itself was unrewarding.Foster's book addresses important issues and it is a good story. My low rating is due to poor craft, which only distracts me from the story. Ernest Gaines also uses simple language and is sensitive to characterization, but he manages to help me see and feel and think without ""telling"" me everything.This is book is, however, a pretty good first novel."
3,Wordy,"The book and story is a good idea but the way it's written just ruins it. It's like she repeats a lot of things. She'll say the same things over and over again in different ways in one paragraph and it would be a whole chapter of it. It got real preachy at times also. I like action, so sometimes I would just skip over some things because she was just repeating things and I would want her to get to the point."
2,Overly simplistic and superficial,"The author tries to address too many issues. Rather than exploring a single issue in depth, she tries to tackle death, racism, spirituality and religion, lynching, male-female relationships, black-white relationships and on and on. The result is that she does none of these themes justice."
3,Mixed Emotions,"This is a good story, but I never could get a feeling of period. It could have taken place during 1919 or 1940 or the present. For some reason, I just didn't feel I was there with the characters.The writing is good, and it's a nice story, but a little too heavy on agenda, dialect, and preaching. She's actually confirmed everything I believe--but I don't want my convictions confirmed in a novel. Especially since this is a road that's been traveled many times before, in books, movies, etc.Still, she's a good writer and is obviously passionate about what she believes. If this is her first book, and I think it is, she has real potential for future novels, and I'd probably try another, because I like the style of her writing."
1,have you read a good book in a long time?,have you red a good book in a long time? i have to say this book is is amazing period or . beverly cleary and roald dahl are one of my favorite authors i always find a way to sneak money out of my moms wallet just to read one of there books but reading this book [henry and ribsy] topped beverly cleary as one of my favorite authors of all time this book is funny and amazing to read you just truly dont wanna put this awesome amazing inspring story of a little boy and his cute adorable dog [yes i mean ribsy] down and dont forget to read all the other books by beverly cleary and henry like........... henry and the paper rout and henry and beezus and dont forget henry huggin........... oh i forgot to say to read .. ribsy and henry and the clubhouse
5,Healing spiritual message,The spiritual truths in this book are so powerful that I experienced a complete physical healing after only reading the first0-some odd pages!
5,I loved the book!,"I loved the book because it was interesting, funny and I loved when Henry caught his own fish at the end of the book."
2,A True Disaster!,"I love disaster films but this film is a disaster! Bad acting, horrible script, low budget, cheesy CGI...why go on? Don't waste your time on this trash."
4,arrived 2-1-13,"Good pkg. Easy open.Oh well the computer wants more words. I watched one movie 2012, Ice Age, I think. It was kinda hokey and the iceburg could not have hit the areas that are mentioned in the movie. Otherwise the disc was in good shape, no pauses and no skips."
2,Disaster,"It was on ok movie, got tired of all the running off the road and crashing their cars. It was definitely a B movie, don't think I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Adventures of Bulk and Skull,Hey Bulk/Skull fans theirs finally a video for you! This video shows some of the memorable moments that Bulk and Skull have tried to figure out the ranger's true identity even though most of the time they ended up failing.Plus the ranger's were right in front of them so how could they be so clueless?
5,How to Write It: A Complete Guide to Everything You'll Ever Write,"For an underlying idea of how to approach the different kinds of everyday writing, this book has it all. I would not suggest copying letters word for word; however, there are focused phrases which apply to all situations and act as an inspiration for one's very own personalized letter. At the very least, this book demonstrates how to write with the appropriate tone, how to approach a topic and express succinct thoughts with grace and manners. This book makes a writer out of everyone."
3,Errors,"While a great reference, this book has many typographical and gramerical errors. It also is not categorized properly and reiterates the same facts over and over. It does however have great pointers on what to say in a letter. However its view is too simplistic for business writing. I would not suggest this book for a professional opinion. I would suggest it however for a day to day reference on personal letters."
4,Wolf Rider,"I read the book Wolf Rider i though it was a pretty good book. It has some boring parts, but there are also some really good exciting parts. The auther makes you feel really close to the characters. He really expresses what is happening and what the characters are feeling. Sometimes the book has some kinda sad and scary parts. Some good things about the book is it has very good well writen conversations, exciting parts, fun charicters, and a lot more. There arnt many but there is a few bad things about the book: some sad things happen in the book, and sometimes it seems like the book keeps draging on about parts. I would rate Wolf Rider a four point book sence it is a over all good book."
5,"Stuff you won't find elsewhere, very handy","How to Write It is written by an experienced writer who knows what she's talking about. It's especially worth seeking out for some of the templates it features, including several related to public relations projects (for example, how to write a pitch letter, press release, and backgrounder). Lots of social and job-search related guidance, for those whose skills in those areas are rusty from disuse. And for the young person or the beginner, plenty of help with how to write invitations, thank-you's, all kinds of things someone should have taught us, but probably didn't (or were we all absent the same day?). Easy to use."
5,Put this book next to your dictionary,"This is one of those books that is so incredibly useful and so easy to read, you have to wonder why no one thought to write one like it before now. I got the book to check out the email section, but was literally thunderstruck by all of the other fantastic writing examples and templates. I think this would be a great book to give a graduate, because it has examples for writing many of life's ""must-to's"", such as thank you notes, condolences, credit inquiries and a lot more. I'm a writer, but even I get ""writer's block"" sometimes. This book is a real gem."
3,Could have been better,"This book is not bad but could have been better. There is a distinct tendency for the author to be repetitive and each example letter is shown in full, which results in a lot of (wasted) white space on the pages. Also, in my opinion, the book itself has been put together relatively cheaply; it's reminiscent of a large mass-market paperback. I prefer 'How to say it' by Rosalie Maggio which covers most of the same ground."
5,End writer's block forever!,"From Marisa D'Vari, author of Script Magic: Subconscious Techniques to Conquer Writer's Block. Many people are ""blocked"" when it comes to writing something as simple as a thank you letter, let alone a formal report. Sandra Lamb makes it easy for anyone to write any kind of letter with this well-written resource! A must for everyone's book shelf!"
1,Seems like a nice product...but beware of missing parts,"I picked this up at a Target Store. Seems like a nice product for the price, but beware of missing parts, and lackluster response from the manufacturer's customer service....almost 2 weeks and still waiting."
1,Not worth the money,"It broke the first day. It is made of plastic so doesn't hold much weight. Expected a better product for the price. Ended up taking everything back out, taking it apart and returning the wardrobe unit."
3,"""Here Comes the Pain"" Review","A collection of matches and highlights featuring former WWE superstar, Brock Lesnar. A young and athletic superstar, Lesnar was crowned ""The Next Best Thing"" upon his arrival in the WWF in 2002. During a period when wrestling was really at an all-time low, Brock impressed many with some tremendous matches against opponents like The Undertaker, Kurt Angle, Big Show, and The Rock to name a few. This DVD was compiled before Lesnar left wrestling for a chance to play pro football. Like other superstar DVD's, it features an hour-long look at the star's career with exclusive interviews and career highlights as well as ""bonus matches"" shown in their entirety. ""Here Comes The Pain"" is one of the better WWE DVD's of recent memory."
3,Brock Lesnar,"Covers his career pretty good. Good highlights for such a brief Pro wrestling career. There is no UFC stuff on here. It would be good if WWE and UFC could come to an agreement and cover his entire UFC/WWE career, as he is an extroardinary athlete."
5,Just start to a great series!,"The first in this series and is by far one of the best. While it may seem to start out slow, all first books are like this. This book however heats up and never starts. It will bring to life the characters you will get used to as you read the series,lets you see their personalities, etc. The action is wonderfully written. A book that can be read more than once."
5,Great Story,I loved this book! It had an excellent blend of suspense and a good storyline. I love Douglas's description of the battles and how he describes each encounter so thoroughly. I enjoyed reading about the raid on the plutonium carrying boat and how they rescued the ship. This is a great book for anyone who enjoyes other special ops books.
4,Great adventure story,"Great story, a little too much on the descriptions of the hardware for me but otherwise a very enjoyable book"
3,ok but...,"uneccesarily informative. read, pat doriff's, 'file don't pile' on filing alone. it's much better. this guide has too much confusing info. don't buy."
5,a sailing enthusiast,"Dennis Connor is an icon of sailing and this is his story of explaining the loss of The Cup in 1983 and what it took to win it back in 1987. It was certainly not a sure deal that the US or even DC would win. DC is surprisingly candid with his comments. It is certainly not all a blow by blow on the racecourse. He tells about all the smoke filled back room negotiations, fund-raising, the design of the boat, his crew, his strategy, and why he succeeded. Unlike some writing for a mass audience, he does not dumb down his explanations of sailing terms. He does give plenty of explanation of what happens, including how he recruited each crew member and what their job was. The book is well written and has diagrams of key race situations. I would think any one who is interested in sailboat racing would find it a classic."
5,One of the best,"This book is valuable not only as a historical marker of law in the state of Tennessee, but still has relevance for any practicing lawyer. Lee's writing is entertaining and to the point, and this book should be one of the foundations for any person aspiring to learn law in Tennessee."
3,Good toy but fewer than 50 pieces in the set,"I got this set and counted the pieces before giving to my children. Well, only 47 instead of 50. I contacted the company I ordered from and received another set which had exactly the same pieces as the first. We tried to make a creature from the picture and were unable to because the set is missing a large red circle that is supposed to be a creature's head. I do not know what other pieces we are missing. May be, just a faulty batch... Or may be, manufacturer decided to save money. The toy itself is pretty good, my children are interested. But I will not be buying any more toys made by Curious Toys because of misadvertisement."
2,crowd ruined it,I saw this a while ago and for once the ppv had a good card the only problem was the crowd was hella dead.see for your self. I believe the crowd can either break or make an wwe event. i love it when the crowd is live and really into it even if the match isn't that good it makes it that much better. Anyways because the crowd was dead it kinda made the event boring even though the ppv was decent.
3,unforgiven 03,matches just did not seem to gel. triple h/goldberg was good. clear cut. WEIRD seeing kane unmasked.
2,wwe unforgiven,i wanted to see shane vs kane in a 2 out of 3 falls match fall 1 street fight fall 2 steel cage and if it goes to a third fall a no holds barred match
5,2nd Raw PPV,"Unforgiven should be great. With the Dudley Boyz in a Tables match, Chris Jericho & Rob Van Dam in a Triple Threat match, Shane McMahon in a Last Man Standing match, and Goldberg's World Heavyweight Championship match. What else do could you ask for?"
4,A Decent Show,"MATCH 1: WORLD TAG TEAM TITLES - Tables Match - Dudleys Vs La Resistance - 7.5/10.Good match, one of la resistance's better matches.MATCH 2: Scott Steiner vs Test - 6/10.Not bad.MATCH 3: Randy Orton Vs Shawn Michaels - 8.5/10A screwjob finish ruined it slightly.MATCH 4: Lita and Trish Stratus Vs Gail Kim and Molly Holly - 5.5/10.Worth a watch.MATCH 5: LAST MAN STANDING MATCH - Kane Vs Shane McMahon - 9/10.Very brutal match.MATCH 6: INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE - Chris Jericho Vs Rob Van Dam Vs Christian - 8/10.A mix of mat wrestling, high flying and hardcore action.MATCH 7: Jim Ross And Jerry Lawler Vs Al Snow And Jonathan Coachman - 4/10What the hell was this?MATCH 8: WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE - Triple H Vs Goldberg - 8/10.A good match to end the event."
2,WWE Unforgiven 2003,"WWE Unforgiven 2003 (RAW)Hershey,PennsylvianiaTrish Stratus & Lita vs Molly Holly & Gail KimRandy Orton vs Shawn MichaelsWWE Intercontinental TitleRob Van Dam vs Chris Jericho vs ChristainThe Coach & Al Snow vs Jim Ross & Jerry LawlerWinners announcers on RAWLast Man Standing MatchShane Mcmahon vs KaneWWE World Tag Team TitlesTable Match EliminationDudley Boyz (Spike,Bubba,Dvon) vs La Resistance (Rob Conway,Rene Dupree,Sylvian Griner)WWE World TitleTriple H vs GoldbergIf Goldberg losses he is out of WWE"
2,i paid top dollar for this?,"the dudleys get screwed against the frenchies.scott stiener-legend battles test-total loser.orton vs hbk.im lucky i was concious long enough to watch this.then some chicks rolled around for a few minutes.cool!shane o vs kane was awesome once again.just for future reference,every ppv with shane o is good.well that match anyway.its a 5 star match with no rules.either a last man standing or ambulance.rvd vs ysj vs christian was saved by rvd.he has a knack for making any old stupid match good.ysj deserves some credit too.then the next match sucked.then goldberg fights triple h.goldberg beats the crap out of him............................."
5,the first great raw-brand ppv!,"unforgiven 2003 was a great ppv. the 3 best matches were orton/micheals, the triple threat intercontinental title match, and shane vs. kane in a last man standing. Unforgiven was much better then a lot of the other ppvs of 2003. The best part of the ppv was that Triple H finally lost his title. FINALLY!!!"
1,False advertising,"This product is 500mg per pill, the dosage is 2000mg. This is blatant and misleading product information. You can find much cheaper 500mg vitamin C pills. I wanted 2000mg pills so I wouldn't have to take 4 giant pills at a time."
3,"Lip Fix, OK","I purchased this awhile back. It's OK, nothing fab. It works, but the tiny bottle does not hold a lot of product for the price. I just tried Urban Apothecary SWAK Lipstick Sealant and I like that better. It's double the size and does not sting like this one."
4,Great service,I was a little concerned about shipping when I received an email confirming my order two days before the product was suppose to arrive but it arrived right on schedule.
5,Yogi The Easter Bear,"This is a great TV special that deserves to see the light of day on DVD. It is funny and it shows Yogi and Boo Boo at their best. It earned all kinds of awards when it first aired on Cartoon Network and deservedly so. I highly recommend it to everyone.There is a much better reason to purchase this DVD if you are a Yogi Bear or Hanna-Barbera fan, though. Warner Home Video could be using this DVD as a test product to see if there is interest in releasing more Yogi Bear on DVD. I don't know this for a fact, but it makes sense. It is important that all Yogi fans support this release with a purchase to help see more classic H-B cartoons come to DVD.This is an entertaining special in itself and it deserves a place on your DVD shelf. I also recommend buying it to help see more Hanna-Barbera classic cartoons come to DVD as well. This releae has a double-sided implication to it that cannot be ignored. Please buy it."
2,Not what we had hoped,"We bought this for the kid, thinking it would be a fun holiday special with a classic character. We didn't realize it was made as recently as it was, and as such, it lacked some of the nostalgia for us. It seemed to have more zip and lack the same innocence the old Yogi cartoons had. More importantly, though, it didn't really hold our son's interest. About 10 minutes into it he was more interested in going to play with toys in the other room.If you're a Yogi die hard, and a fan of the new movie, this may be up your alley. If you're looking for the older style nostalgic type show, pass on this and go to something like The Easter Bunny is Coming to Town, or Here Comes Peter Cottontail."
2,Not the greatest,"We have decided not to let our kids watch this video anymore. There are phrases like ""shut up"" and other inappropriate words and actions."
5,great pie dish,"Before I got this dish I baked a couple of pies on thanksgiving, one in a Pyrex dish, the other in one of those disposable things from the supermarket. I bought this because it was so pretty, and it made me feel special to have such a nice piece. I bought the second one because I began making pies more often, and why should only the apple pie look beautiful on Thanksgiving? The pies seemed to cook better, but I wasn't sure if it because they did or I liked the pans so much. Last year I made two pies for some guests to take home in those tins from the supermarket and oh, my what a difference. They are certianly not a kitchen requirement but if you like how they look and want to treat yourself they certainly are nice. Oh, and they clean very easily as well. ..."
3,"overall, a good collection","In this collection from Seven Stories Press, Linh Dinh has collected together twelve works of fiction by Vietnamese writers. Some of these works are quite sharp, like Nguyen Thi Am's ""Sleeping on Earth,"" a story that by itself is worth the sticker price of this book. Other stories, like The Giang's ""A stagnant Water Place,"" are inventive, but ultimately unfulfilling.But I do applaud Linh Dinh for the scope of this collection--in this, he puts together works from both literary and popular authors. Though Vietnam is clearly a place torn in its artistic identity (as we learn in the introduction, one of Vietnam's most famous writers, Duong Thu Huong, is banned), this collection is a good intro to let you learn of some names that hopefully will be a little more available in English in the near future (and they are--check Amazon for Nguyen Huy Thiep, Thu Huong Duong and others). Linh Dinh set out to expose a new landscape in literature, and his collection certainly does that."
1,Horrendous slashing of the original,"The original miniseries was a really good show . . . all four hours of it. But this release has been so severely slashed [to just 93 minutes, less than half of the story] that the story makes no sense. Actions seem to be taken for no reason at all [when the basis for the action was dropped to the cutting room floor]. The people who made this travesty ought to be ashamed of themselves."
3,Cool conclusion,It was an interesting way to have a follow up with the escaped prisoners. How much of this was actual fact and how much was hollywood hype is up in the air. It was an entertaining movie overall.
2,A real dissapointment from the original mini-series,"I'm a real history buff, especially for WWII related subjects & I saw the original mini-series The Great Escape the Untold Story. This true story is a great addition to the original movie because it completes the whole saga that took place during & after the war & definitly needed to be told. But when it came out on video I was dissapointed with the extreme editing which essentually ruined it. In my opinion don't buy this video. I hope that they release it on DVD fully unedited."
5,You WILL Love This Film: - Too Funny !,"Was lucky to discover this indy gem at the Film Festival circuit this year...loved, loved, loved it. I found myself chuckling at the most crazy, absurd circumstances. It's a smart, laugh-out-loud comedy and was thrilled to see The Drummond Will making it to DVD. Will be a fine addition to my DVD collection right there with my other fave comedies: The Wedding Crashers, Something About Mary, Caddyshack to name a few. Enjoy the show!"
4,Winning against the odds!,"This is an inspiring story for young males, inner city youth, aspiring physicians, or anyone who may need a story of encouragement. These three young men have faced adversity throughout life. Coming from less than desirable communities, single and low income families survived the rigors of peer pressure, street life, college and medical school. There friendship is one to be emulated by all. I commend them for their diligence and commitment to each other, their communities and medicine. Well written and well done!"
5,Amazing,"I along with about 30 other college students had to read this book for our ""Juvenile Justice"" class. What really made it interesting was how the book didn't focus on just the three as one individual but it instead looked at all three people and also each chapter took into play each individual.It's not every day or even every year that you hear about three young people making a ""positive"" pact for their future and then no matter what happens sticking to it or trying to reach for it all together.What an amazing group of men they have turned out to be, an inspiration for their families, friends and ultimately their community.Only thing that could have made this better was actually hearing them or even having a chance to talk to them in person and thank them for not giving up, for reaching for their goals and inspiring countless others to make a difference in their own lives and communties."
2,Just an okay read,"I must begin by saying that I am very particular about the writing level/style of both fiction and nonfiction. The story behind the book is interesting, but not that novel, and the writing is plain old dull. Dragged myself through it."
5,Inspired,This book was amazing. I enjoyed reading the stories and the flow of the words. The Drs inspired not only those in their neighborhood but also me.
4,Awesome book,This book is a must read for young black teenagers without a guide or any direction. It is almost like reading the gospels in the bible. You have three different people telling the same story.
5,A wonderful read!!!!,"Words can not convey what a wonderful book this is!! I chose this book from a book list for a class on cultural diversity mainly because I was a graduate student in nursing and figured I would be able to relate to the medical aspect of the book. I was certainly in for a treat. I finished the book in one night, I couldn't put it down. These three men have overcome so much in the name of friendship and dedication. Kudos to the authors!!!"
5,The Pact,The audio version of this compelling inspirational memoir is excellent. The authors speak in their own voices and my high school students are enjoying every minute of it. We are all waiting for the movie!!!
2,The Pact,If you like how I made it it is interesting in seeing what these three men went through to become doctors.
3,"great story, poorly written","Could become recommended reading for high schoolers. Great story but presented in a fragmented and poorly written manner. Not taking anything away from the three guys and their accomplishments, wait for the made for TV movie."
5,Inspiring account,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It reads very well and the perspective that each of the three men gives is very interesting. I highly recommend it for any young person who wants to do something with their life.
2,"Doctors, not Writers","Great story, boring book:Me and my two friends grew up in a ghetto. We did some bad things, thought about becoming rap singers, then went back to our plan to be doctors. Shout out to all the teachers that guided us.Great job guys in becoming doctors and dentists. The saddest thing about this book is you could have spent the time saving lives and fixing teeth instead of writing a book that bored me to tears. I had to force myself to finish. I did it out of of obligation, not pleasure. Figured hey if these guys can become doctors, I can finish this book-anything is possible if one puts there mind to it."
2,Punch line? We all have potential... even if we punch?,"The Pact is an interesting story. Three young black men from Newark leave the streets and head to medical and dental school. They depend on each other for support... this is ""The Pact.""I'm glad they were successful and hope they will continue to be successful. I am discouraged that they did this while they, on occasion, beat people, stabbed people, sold drugs, and stole things from stores. This is inspiring? What is the message here?Break the bones of a white boy if he is staring at you (page 134)? Steal a sweatshirt because somebody told you it was easy (page 137)? Armed robbery (page 93)? ""I jabbed the crackhead lightly in the thigh right under his butt and quickly closed the blade, hoping I hadn't hurt him"" (page 81), after punching and kicking a helpless person for 20 minutes, wrote Rameck.None of these messages were inspiring. I'd say these doctors have a lot to answer for, and these answers are not in this book."
5,Outstanding,"I found the strength, courage and determination of these three men to be outstanding. Not only have they set a standard for other young men in similiar situations to follow, but they have shown that no matter what the odds, you can achieve your goals and dreams. I am so proud of these young men. I have purchased their book as a graduation gift for my son who will be headed off to college this fall. Thank you for being courageous enough to share your story........."
1,Terrible...unfortuantely,"Unfortunately, within 1 month, both this unit and the batteries I purchased (by the same company) had all (6 of them) either leaked or went bad. Really disappointed!"
5,The Tymes CD,"Since I no longer have a turntable I've been unable to play my LP of this group. I was so very pleased to find this CD of The Tymes. What a wonderful group, so nice to hear that good old mellow music again, reminiscent of the Mills Bros, Platters, etc. This is a great CD!!!"
4,Perfect for the Purpose,I bought this to connect my computer to my tv via an s-video out port to a composite video in port and the picture looks amazing so this little guy did just what i needed.
2,it works (kinda),"I think that any time you use a converter, you usually lose some quality. I was not expecting to lose this much though. I only used this for a couple of days and gave up because the quality of the image was so bad. I think it's just the nature of the product. A composite cable does not carry the same quality signal as s-video and trying to down-convert the signal is futile."
1,Does not work,"My rear-projection HD TV has both S-Video and component hookups on the back. I wanted to see what Nintendo's Wii in S-Video looked like. When I plugged this in, the picture became oddly pixelated and looked far worse than just component alone."
4,Purchased for experimental purposes,Bought to run an experiment with a video switcher between cameras with S-video output. The experiment was to see how far we could run RCA cables and still get a decent video signal. Results are still pending.
4,Pretty good little adaptor,"This thing definitely gets the job done. It's not as clear as real S-video, but the picture is clear and usuable. I am using it to display karaoke lyrics on a tv and it works great for that. For the money, this adaptor can't be beat."
2,Not worth it...,"As a full time trader of 12 years I'm always looking for new ways to trade and new books to read and auction market theory recently has peaked my interest. After reading Dalton's Mind Over Markets, which I thought was phenomenal, I was excited to read Steidlmayer's contribution.You learn about his background, which is interesting. He describes some auction market theory and tools to apply. But mostly he advertises his capflow 32 product. Annoyingly so.While I was able to pull out a few nuggets of wisdom I'd rather have my $45 back. My bottom line recommendation to you is to go spend a weekend at Barnes and Noble and read it for free while spending your hard earned money on Dalton's book."
5,"""Deadly Beloved"" is deadly brilliant!","If you're looking for a low-budget B-movie with actual character development and plot (sprinkled with healthy doses of eye candy, CAMP, ghosts, and gore), then you MUST get this movie! It looks and sounds GREAT! Much better quality than most low-budget films out there. It's a MUST-OWN for true fans of indie film and B-flicks! If you have no sense of humor or campiness, then this movie may not be for you."
1,Calling this a B rated movie is more than it deserves!,Watch out! This movie is terrible. Stupid plot and poor special effects. A couple of the actors were believable and quite good but their supporting actors should not be in the movie business. I was very disappointed and the previous reviews of 5 stars were way off base. The only thing I can think of for the high ratings is the reviewers may be friends of the actors/ movie makers. Who know's. Don't waste your money. I'm don't have the time to leave many reviews but I had to warn you.
1,THE ONLY DUMBASS TO BUY THIS DVD!!!,"This is simple this DVD IS BORING AS MATCH CLASS!!!THE WOMES MATCH SUCKED FOR 10 MINUTES!!!BOOKER T VS CHIRSTIAN WAS WORSE THAN WATCHING HOGAN WRESTLE!RVD and Kane vS LA resistance was ok,GOldust and Rico sucked more than Cena vs HHH at WM 22,Dudleys vs those guys is not even worth 1 cent,Test vs Steneirr made me cry,Highlight reel was awesome as always and the main event was awesome lots of interference not sucky at all.I feel Sorry for Everyone who was live watching this boring ppv."
1,totally [lousy] .....oh it's true!,this was a bad ppv don't get it. if you seen bad blood well this ppv was 1 week before bad blood and it was like a demonstration and what was going to happen on bad blood.
1,arrived completely broken in several pieces,I wish the this item was packed more carefully. It was completely shattered inside the box and I had a hard time repacking the box for return since there were several very sharp shards inside.
1,SIZE??,"RECEIVED AS A GIFT -- CANNOT USE. ARE MEASUREMENTS GIVEN FOR ANY OF THIS DESIGN'S PIECES? 11 INCH DINNER PLATE? 10 INCH? DITTO SALAD (7?, 9?). HAVE I MISSED THIS PART OF THE ONLINE DESCRIPTION? THIS IS ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR ME."
5,Multi-purpose bowl,"Like the other reviewer, my dishes are a combination of Dansk Concerto Allegro Blue and Christianshavn. We use these pasta bowls all the time, and not just for pasta. They are also good if you are eating soup or casseroles. On the four for three special, they would average in cost to be $8.24 each and with super saver shipping, this is a good price. Even though these are billed as individual pasta bowls, they are large enough to use for condiments as well, so they do double duty as servers."
4,Is a product that does a thing...Does a thing,"How exactly an item like this would exceed expectations is beyond me. However, the discs all burned well and have yet to fail to burn or read. I used there for system imaging and to burn dvd copies for my less technical savvy family members."
2,Bowls to use for soup and bread bowls,I am sure this is a fine company and this is a fine product but it just isn't what I needed to used to make soup bread bowls. They are really small for a big soup meal but they do work great in the microwave to warm up enough food for one person to eat something. I will likely use them to warm leftovers.
3,Le Mans 2006,"This DVD is from a new production company and is not as good as the 2005 Le Mans review DVD. However, it does keep to the same format of showing the prerace activities and a good recap of qualifying. Well worth it if you enjoy sports car racing."
4,Great book,"This book is very useful, but may be difficult to read for some beginners. I will keep it for my library and my future career."
2,Language Development - Kindle Edition,"I bought this book for a course I'm taking, and although I can read it on my Mac, I recently bought a Kindle Fire and it doesn't work on it. I was hoping I could read it on my Kindle Fire so that I won't have to lug the book to school. I am still trying to get Amazon customer service to look into this."
4,Thank You,I would rate this purchase very well ... the book was received in a timely manner. The text is in excellent condition. The cost was reasonable (could be better).
2,"This album is [weak], not worthy of buying!",[Weak]! First of all this album has only a few songs that are worth listinin' to...the rest of the album is [weak]...eminem is right...this grandfather (BENZINO) should quit the game because there is no room in hip hop for [him]...
5,benzino is a positive role model for the entire gay commuity,"As long as you don't care about rhymes, beats or anything worth listening to, then this album is great. Benzino is a proud and open homosexual and the only thing gayer than his music is him. So I'm sure all you homosexuals out there will love it, unless you have ears."
1,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Benzino is by far one of the worst rappers EVER! i aint even gonna speak on the album that much, i bought this album in frustrations.. and i thought it was sad for this guy to get so much disrespect from the media, the whole Shady/aftermath/g-unit beef.. people said he was bad, i had to clear this up.. cause he could'n be THAT bad.. when i listened, he was even worse than i expected... this dude has no talent what so ever...!!! thank god for Eminem ending his career!! and the fact some people below actually give this album 4 mics.. they are completely out of their minds!!! no human with some kind of sense, would give this album more than 1 mic!!!"
1,"Really bad album, by someone who should know better.","This was a pretty bad album. It had terrible lyrics and no good song concepts. There were 1 or 2 good beats on the whole album, but overall its a really bad album. I respect Benzino for being the first openly gay rapper, and for being such an outspoken defender of homosexual rights in hip-hop, but he doesn't have the skills to rap. He should continue his advocacy in The Source and The Advocate and leave the rapping to the professionals."
2,Redemtion Review. 2 1/2 stars,"You can tell Ben went all out on this cut to show the public he was still real and worthy of your time. To show you he could come back even if his first album flopped. Sorry to say he didn't do that much better. His beats are alright but his guests do a better job spittin' than he can, not good. I'm not saying this CD stinks, because it doesn't. It has its high points, not too many, but it does. Benzino said that his skills at writing were getting better, and its showing."
1,Is this it?,"All that time in the studio and this is it? The state of Mass is'nt really on the Hip-Hop map, but by releasing this, it only sets us back even more. And what type of ryhming style is he using? It never seems to go anywhere. Some of his beats are O.K at best but he should of spent more time on his lyrics. His BIG single on this CD was ""Rock the Party"" and it just feels so flat. Benzino can truly benifit if he had a ghost writer instead. He has a great voice and its a shame that its used for this."
1,Don't Get Cheated,"If you wanna waste your time and spend some money, go ahead buy this bad album. Benzino's lyrics are bad, expressing nothing but his inanbility to accept that he will never be a good lyrist. Benzino clearly has no ideeas for his songs. He feels the need to come up with two disses (towards Eminem), just to fill his album. He even puts a kid on his album, which sounds so bad, that you think that Pinochio has a better voice. Just a complete waste of time."
1,THE LATEST PIECE OF TRASH ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAUCE,"Following the decline of his increasingly horrific magazine ""The Source"", Benzino attempted to find reconciliation in an album of his own, the follow-up to 2001's ""The Benzino Project."" This CD is junk, save your money, lock your doors, dont even look at it or you might turn to stone. If I could give it zero stars I would. Benzino is not a rapper, he's a journalist- and a terrible one at that."
1,"Weak, weak, weak","It's no secret that Benzino runs The Source, and I'm sure this album will receive 5 Mics in that publication pretty soon.This album is TERRIBLE. The beats are alright at times, but Benzino has practically no skills at all as an MC. He needs to use his clout to hire better ghostwriters."
1,WHY?,Why are you realeasing another album when we all know you can't rap? Why are you paying people to write 5 stars review in this web? Give up. Please have some dignity and retire. PLEASE
2,Over all the Beats are Ok but The overall album is weak,The Beats on this album is ok(average). His lyrics and his flow are not so good. His last album is better. I would listen to this before i buy it.
3,has anybody noticed?,"That 50 Cent's ""21 Questions"" sounds just like Benzino's ""Would You""? If not, check it out. LisaRaye is rapping on it. Makes you wanna say ""hmmmmmm""."
1,This sorry CD is available for only $2 b/c it sucks,"As someone mentioned earlier, before you two retyped the same review that you wrote on the page before this one, this CD is availabe on Amazon for $2 used. If it is so damned ""hot"" and ""awesome"" it seems to me that people would not be selling it for $2 so shortly after it has come out. It also seems that many people would be buying the album since it is so cheap. Why are they not? Because Benzino sucks and this album sucks. I promise you won't see any JayZ albums on here for $2. Give it up guys. You obviously are not convincing anyone that this album is good. Oh and quit resubmitting the same review...it is annoying. As for anyone who falls for the good reviews of this album or as for anyone who actually likes Benzino (hey there could be a few people in the country who actually do), you are in luck because his albums suck so much that they are dirt cheap."
5,Don't be fooled by these no life Stans,"Look at all these brain washed stans. It's clear that these bums have not even heard the album and are just bashing it because of Eminem. I mean a majority of these reviews don't even make any references to the actual music. Cut out all that taking sides in beef stuff. I mean just cause you favorate rapper don't like somebody, doesn't mean you have to do the same. This album was banging from begining to end. It's got it all. It's a very versatile album. It's got it's club joints as well as joints for the streets. And stop fronting like Benzino is the worst rapper ever. He ain't no Biggie but dude is better then alot of rappers out.StandoutsCall My Name, 44 Cal. Killa, Would You, Make You Wanna Holla, Rock the Party, Different Kind of Lady, Love.Don't let these closed minded Stans fool you. This is a superb album."
1,Benzinhoe has no skills,"Benzino is a hoe. He has no right to put out an album. You know why he has such great collabo's cause he owns the source stupid. do not buy this album. Blame the white man that's his style. This album's gonna go aluminum, he'll get dropped from his label (history repeating itself). This hoe is the real racist, Hip-Hop is for everyone. He should appreciate the great attention em has brought to the game. Anyone who would buy this has no idea of what real rap is. It's so easy to rap about money, cars and hoes.Shady puts his life on the track.You heard it yourself it's bad."
5,Great CD,"This cd is solid. Songs like staying 4 eva, neva shuvin, would you and different kind a lady, represent true hip hop. ... This album is much better than any of eminems work and so are Benzino's Remix Project, Benzino Project, and MadeMen Classic Limited Edition. Go check these albums out. Check out real hip hop!!!!!!!"
5,I love Benz,"redemption album got serious burn. 1 of the top cd's of 2003. he'z got 'it'. great feel for making joints you can feel and get live to. get it on, would u, rock the party, hoola hoop, stayin 4eva, neva shuvin - will keep you bangin your head all day long. don't hate on Benz- bean mami"
5,one of the greatest books,This is one of the greatest books i have found about Ross Lovegrove. It has beautiful images.
1,"Clunky, horrible",You can only wear this bag as a messenger bag and not as a shoulder bag. It is too big and ill-designed. I recommend getting a good backpack instead.
3,Not a Grout Cleaner,I bought this to clean the grout lines in my tile floor. It did not work. Very soapy mess as well.
1,THEY SENT THE WRONG DISH,"I'm sure this platter would have been very nice.....if I would have been sent it. I was actually sent something completely different that had a plate with a detachable dish. It was a present for my mother and arrived the day before her birthday. At that point, I didn't want to show up to her birthday party empty handed, and didn't want to go through the hassle of shipping the wrong one back."
2,"Strong on emotion, weak on science","Devra Davis presents her strident feminism in boldly written, take-no-prisoners fashion. She will delight readers who agree with her view that the Earth's environment will be destroyed as fast as they let the corporations do it. But she makes no pretense to objectively examine the facts and presents few substantive facts or critical reasoning. She makes fantastic leaps of logic belonging wholly outside the world of science or academia and plays to the emotions of her readers.I would not recommend this book to males, conservatives or intellectuals."
5,Discovering the Truth Behind the Smoke,"Dr. Davis' book is one of the most an insightful and insprirational books on enviornmental health currently available to the general public. Using anectotal and statistical information, a strong storyline develops that clearly points out the the tangled web of deception by the government and industry that has undermined the health and well being of Americans and people throughout the world during last century through to today. Anyone who has ever questioned why particular disorders and disesase are more prevelent in particualr geographic locations must read this book."
5,Blue Djinn RULE,"The Blue Djinn of Babylone is AMAZING!!! I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down! It was as though my hands were glued to the book! My mom got mad when she saw my light on at 11:00 PM because I was still reading. When you start to read this book, you will wish that P.B. Kerr would hurry up with another book it's soo good!!!!"
5,It comes in handy,"I ordered several of these to give to some of the WoW-freaks I know for birthdays/Christmas/etc, they all thanked me for the cards and I know that they are more than happy to have two months of free gametime."
5,Prepaid card for WoW is a nice way to pay and forget about it for a bit.,"It's nice to have these cards, and with the free shipping it makes it even better.Using these cards is a nice way to pay up a couple months in advance and just be able to enjoy WoW for what it is.WoW is a great game, though when Vanguard comes out, I'll probably be either adding it to my list of games I play or switching over from WoW. But if you've never played World of Warcraft, then be warned that once you start (with anny Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) your life might get sucked away... seriously. They are highly addictive and have the monthly fees as well. So exercise some self-control and enjoy the game!"
2,Effective but a little more costly way of protecting your credit card info,Nice way not to share quite as much with yet another game that wants your credit card information. Though at the time of writing this it was still cheaper to buy game time on the website with a credit card after shipping and handling or sales tax. very nice way to limit game time with children and make it not quite so automatic for a company to directly charge new funds.
4,World of Warcraft,The game is exciting and the peer to peer contact within the game makes it even more exciting. It is one of the best PC games I have ever played.
2,Too soon..,"They released this game WAY too soon.When you first get into the game, you are overwhealmed at so many features, it is a cornucopia of fun. However -- once you spend any great deal of time, you'll realize the bugs, balance, content, and support issues override any fun in the game. There is so much about this game that isn't done, and so much that doesn't get addressed. SERIOUS class flaws that persist from minor patch to minor patch make playing a chore after you level 1 or 2 characters to a high level (50-60), you start ""twinks"", low level chars with lotsa money. Its just the same over and over, same bugs, same content. The most serious flaw is the worthless PVP content. I thought that WOW was going to be what DAOC should have been, but the lack of attention to PVP issues has completely ruined this feature for me.Give this game 2-3 months and it might be ready."
1,Disappointed,This card right now is higher priced after shipping ($26.45 + $6.25 = $32.70) than the monthly fee Blizzard is charging which is $14.99/month.
1,DON'T GET RIPPED OFF,"English/French game card are NOT COMPATIBLE. French version of the game need FRENCH prepaid cards.The online cost (with direct credit card payment throught Blizzard website) it's a much better deal, here is the prices (Sept. 8, 2005) :1 months = 14,99$US / 17,91$CA3 months = 41,99$US / 49,64$CA (16,55$CA/month)6 months = 77,94$US / 92,14$CA (15,36$CA/month)So, if you take the 3 or 6 months package, you get a lot more for your money. World Of Warcraft prepaid cards are only good for gifts or for people who don't have access to credit card payment."
1,World of Warcraft 60 Day Pre-Paid CD,"This is NOT a CD like the description read. It is only internet game server time to add to the game you are already supposed to have prior to purchasing this item. We assumed we were buying the actual game with a 60 day free period to connect and play online (since it was described as a CD). I was very unhappy with this purchase. My son, who was to receive the actual game for his birthday present, is the victim. I am still unhappy about that."
5,Great Gift Idea for Gamers,"I never know what to get my husband, but he always loves getting WOW gift cards. Easy gift to give for the avid gamer."
4,Usually Cheaper on Gamersloot.net,"Amazon sometimes has decent deals, but I've found it cheaper most of the time at www.gamersloot.netMoreover, I've gotten my code from there in a couple hours (could have been faster but I wasn't by phone and was surprised that they really called me to confirm I was cc owner, was nice in these days of id fraud!)Check it out."
5,World of Warcraft 60 day cards,"Price is good for 60 days if you want to do it in 2 month increments, but the game is so good it is addicting and it is easy to put too much time into the game and not into other things like school, chores, etc."
4,"Meh, use Paypal. You get a free month.","I used this when I first started a toon and before my Warcrack addiction took hold of my soul.This works for you to test out the game and be certain that your life is worth sacrificing to to make it to Kara. But, after the 60 days was up I just switched to Paypal, they gave me a free month. I don't have to worry about my subsription getting cancelled now. And not having to order a card in advance before the end of each month is a big bonus.If you don't have a checking account or credit card than this will work just fine for you to get your fix. If you have the option though, I'd recommend just doing the automatic debits.For the Horde!"
1,"Worthless Card, Great Game!",Amazon used to charge less which was a good deal and worth buying. Now the charge is the SAME as the monthly charge at WOW. This card is no longer worth buying. It doesn't save you money or time. I am very disappointed. (Rating is for the card!)
3,Good,"It is good, but it is also becoming a bit dull. The last patch of WOW had a bit of a lag, the game is good for starters, but for veterans is ok. Need to be WAY more challenging"
3,No point in ordering if it costs the same as a sub...,"This has been a consistently good deal at 24.99 with the free super saver shipping by adding to an order or buying two. Now the price has gone up and honestly, theres no reason to get this if it isn't 25 or less. Adding time from the Blizzard website is instant for .01 more. Game cards were actually on sale for 19.99 locally and I stocked up. Maybe Amazon will follow suit."
5,Works,Item worked as described. I've never had a card tampered with or stolen and its a easier method than using my credit card so i will continue using these.
5,Easy,Game time 60 days. Works like a charm. No waking down to the nearest game store. It is delivered right to my door.
5,Time Continues on,The best way to pay for WoW is through this card. I already have too much coming out at a time through mr credit card now. Time continues on!
5,Pre-Paid Fun,This is a really easy way of paying for your World of Warcraft experience. If you don't want to have to put credit card information into the game site to pay for the game or wish to only play the game on a semi-regular basis and don't want to worry about paying for time you won't spend playing then this is the way to go. The card gives you 60 days worth of game time when you've entered the scratch off code onto the World of Warcraft website.
3,Is Blizzard out of thier minds???,Blizzard finally caved. I have been a HUGE fan of all the titles that Blizzard has released - until now. I have always admired how Blizzard has always offered free server access (Battlenet) once you have purchased their games. What gives??? I basically have to pay for the game every month that I play instead of buying the game once and for all. This is a major bummer for those of us on tight budgets. If this is a sign of future gaming practices - count me out.
1,who ever put the price on this needs it fixed NOW,the amazon.com price for this product is roughly around 25-30 USand the amazon.ca price is 59.99 that is horribly off because it is a 60 day card which provides the user with 2 months of gameplay (without a gamecard it would cost around 15 a month on a credit card) this gamecard should cost around 35 - 40$and another thing is gamecards can't be used because once the code is put in the card becomes useless.
1,Horrible Price,"I agree with everyone else. The price at futureshop.ca is 39.99. Which isn't too bad. But 59.99, please. Lower the price of it."
5,Great deal!,"The price was a great deal when I picked up two of these. Come time to renew, I'll be checking this item out again. I like having this on my WOW account instead of a credit card! No problems either in dealing with the person who sold the cards! Not sure how it works to be honest, but if I purchase these in the future, I hope to deal with the same ""company"""
4,Does not include the full version of WoW; it is only a time card!,"WoW is exceptionally fun, and this is a good way to pay for it, however, if you buy months in bulk on the Blizzard website, it is less than $15 a month. Also, this card IS NOT AN EXTENSION TO TRIAL TIME AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FULL GAME!!! You MUST buy the game for 20$ BEFORE you can use this card. Other than that, it is very easy to activate the game card using the instructions given."
1,Broken Seal = No Game Card,"I had ordered the 60-Day Pre-Paid Game Card from Amazon on the 8th of June. The shipping was quick and efficient, however, when I received the item I noticed the seal was broken. I didn't pay too much attention to this, because I thought the game card would still be inside. I was gravely mistaken. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the only thing left inside was the 10-Day Free Trial key and the game card was no where to be found.This was extremely disheartening, as I went to ""My Amazon"" to see if I could do anything about it. The return window was closed the moment I had purchased the item. Essentially, this was $28.99 down the drain, and I doubt I'll take my chances purchasing another game card from Amazon. I guess someone from their shipping center must really love the game that much to slash the seal and take the card out of the box. Or if they didn't, then not notice that the seal was broken and sold a box with a 10-Day Guest Pass Key for $28.99."
3,"Not bad, could be better...","I purchased this as a christmas gift, it arrived in great condition in a timely manner, so no problems there. It's a decent fountain, for the price. There are two main areas that I think it could be improved on however. It doesn't have a switch- either you plug it into an outlet with a switch or you unplug it when you don't want it running. Second thing, it would be great if it had some kind of light inside as well to enhance the ambience a little. The pump seems a little loud to me, but my girlfriend doesn't seem to notice or mind."
2,So-so,"As long as you don't expect this to work indefinitely, it looks okay. I added my own polished rocks and it looked better, but only worked for the first couple of weeks before the pump broke down."
1,WARNING - VINYL RIP,"This release is a travesty. After 2 excellent sounding releases of this concert on CD (The initial Polygram S/T release and the Polygram Chronicles 2CD ""Do What You Like""), Lemon Records (hmmmmm, that should warn you)""remastered"" this concert from very used vinyl, which is bad enough, but then digitally maximized it to the point of distortion. If they were going to reissue this, why not just reissue the concert as released originally on CD - at least that was from the master tape. Look instead for either of the above mentioned out of print items."
1,5 Stars for the performance ..HOWEVER .,"Wonderful music sounding bad ..As other reviewers say .. this is a rip from vinyl , and not a good one at that .VERY bad fidelity and distortion on tracks .. I had to get rid of this one .buyer BEWARE .""Lemon Records"" .. may give you a clue ."
4,bdowdy'sreview:gingerbaker'sairforce,"Hi folks! I've just bought and listened to Ginger Baker's AirForce and it's great! The opening track(DaDa Man)and a variation of ""Toad"" are my faves(Baker & Seaman rule!). The only drawback is the audio's quality; some voices & instruments tend to be overpowered by the drums & horns, and the stereo mixing's a bit rough(recording technology was atrocious in those days).Overall though, the mix of jazz,rock,and traditional & world music is fun to listen to. If you're a fan of Cream,you'll love it."
5,HA! 5 stars for talent,"I expected this album to be great just by the line up of musicians. They truly didn't disappoint. Ginger Baker of course was phenomenal as well as Stevie Winwood's belting voice, and Denny Laine's country soul on ""Man of Constant Sorrow"". If you're a fan of music, you should have this in your collection. The African percussion provided by Reebop Kwaku Baah adds a layer of primal beat."
5,My child loves this CD!!,"It was instant love at first hearing for my almost 4 year old son when he heard this CD. We play it on the way to preschool and we both start out day singing the songs. The messages in the songs are great. There is a combination of fun, upbeat songs, and soothing, calming songs."
1,Horrible,These sheets are full of wrinkles even if you take them right out of dryer. Very inferior quality.
3,Roseanne is crazy but fun,"Watching crazy Roseanne run around her nut farm was funny for a couple of episodes, but I think there just wasn't enough to do to propel the show forward. Some of the situations were so obviously contrived and Roseanne was turning her crazy up to 11 for the cameras. I just wish she'd bring the old Roseanne show back."
4,"Roseanne's Nuts, Season One",If you want some great laughs this is it. Roseanne is hysterical and sometimes crass. No subject is sacred and Roseanne has a way to make even sleep apnea and menopause funny. There is definitely no shortage of nuts on her farm!
5,Excellent,"Well worth your time. Extremely illuminating. This is ""Big History"" at it's finest. Spencer traces the origins of religion institutions and religious belief from the most primitive societies to modern day in a completely objective and scientific manner. He uses examples from the most diverse of sources, from works of travel and description of primitive tribes on every continent on earth, to the religious literature of the ancient Egyptians, Hindus, Greeks and Jews. It is an incredible tour de force performance. I can't even imagine the reaction of his Victorian audience, (it was first published in 1885) as he makes no attempt to conceal his disbelief in the myths of Christianity, and pointedly draws parallels to them from every age and every continent.The only other book I am aware of that covers this same material isReligion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought. Which is also well worth your time."
2,Cheap and permeable,"I used these coveralls while tearing down old plaster. After working for a couple hours I took the coveralls off and found that the dust went right through. It filtered out some of the dust, but my old white tshirt was black with that old plaster dust, and the coveralls were just a little gray.It was advertised to ""protect clothing from paint, dust, and dirt"". It may work better for paint; I don't know. But if you're trying to keep dust off your clothes, I would not recommend this at all.Also, I'm about 5 ft. 10in. and 180 pounds. The XL size is just a little too short in the inseam and narrow in the shoulders."
1,Too thin material,"This product is too thin material and poorly made for painting or any dusty work, will not protect clothing at all."
1,Order cancelled so seller could raise price,My order was cancelled & $ refunded a few days after I placed it so the seller could raise the price of the product.
4,A Good Book,I found this book to be both interesting and sad. A real tribute to the brave souls lost on not only 9-11 but during the Fire Commisioners term in office.I cant imagine being in his place!I thought this book read fast and am glad I read it.God Bless the souls lost on 9-11 and God Bless America
1,the running man,"Tom von essen was the only member of the Fire Dept to run away from the disaster of 9/11. He is seen on national TV with his cerimonial turnout coat and helmet. three days later he is seen , with the President in a battered helmet and coat showing burn marks of a real firefighting veteran.This book ,like that vision is filled with half truths and lies from a man who has no shame.A man who has always capitalized on the working heros of the FDNY and tried to run a Department when he addmits that he couldn,t pass the fire Lt. test. We question what happened to all the unfavorable reviews sent to amazon.com"
5,A Wonderful Book,"Following the conclusion of Thomas Von Essen's (the former New York City Fire Commissioner) book, I was deeply touched in the way Commissioner Von Essen honors the men he was worked with, the New York City Firemen. His recollection of his own experiences on September 11th identified the great challenge New York City faced, as well as the entire country.I have always been impressed by the unique characteristics of our countries leaders, Strong of Heart gives us a clear view of what it took to lead New York City back to where it was before 9/11. I strongly recommend this book to those who enjoy learning about the sacrifice and dedication each NYC Firemen practices through their job."
4,The Irony of the Burqa,"Khadra's novel is sensitive and stark. The heartbreak of lives broken by Taliban rule is present on every page. Good men and women turn to violence and irrationality in a culture bent on denying all human rights. However, the final irony is that the burqa both suffocates and shields. It protects a woman from sexual advances yet turns her into an object of such mystery that her female form is a cause for intense arousal. While a woman's identity is lost under the burqa, the final act of sacrifice that allows Zunaira to live is only possible because two women can trade places anonymously. The stoning and execution of burqa-clad women both dehumanizes and intensifies the agony of the bound and helpless victims. The novel is haunting."
4,A different universe,"The Swallows of Kabul takes us not just to a different world, but a different universe. Life under the Taliban changed everything for Afghans, erasing the joys of life and straining the bonds between man and wife. Read the book slowly, one chapter at a time, so you can absorb the strangeness of this world. Only then can you understand how these lives spiral apart and together. The book is wonderful, in taking us to a world we will (hopefully) never experience - and deeply tragic, because we can appreciate how much Afghan society lost under the Taliban."
3,The Swallows of Kabul,"Very difficult to read. I am having a difficult time finishing it though it is a small book! I love reading about mid-eastern culture, but really am not enjoying this one :("
5,Impact of Taliban,"Set in Taliban Afghanistani Kabul, this book traces two married couples and how their relationships change in response to the punitive and restrictive environment of Kabul.This book is GREAT!! Reading it is like absorbing the entire essence of Kabul and its people, culture, food and religion.This book also made me ponder how culture/religion/environment impact relationships, people's souls and psyches."
4,Should be a 4.5. Great book!,"The cover of this book compares it to The Kite Runner, so it caught my attention. I honestly could not stop reading as ""Yasmina Khadra"" does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters. He weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people's humanity.My only nit is the ending was a bit predictable. That said, it was still a very good ending that rings true. SPOILER: If you wonder why she didn't come back, consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street, which led to them being stopped, which ultimately resulted in her husband's death.I honestly can't wait to read more by ""Yasmina Khadra""."
2,Disappointing Book,"The writer did not succeed in drawing you into the story. I found the book very depressing.Again, this was a book chosen for our book club and we all had essentially the same response to the story."
3,Interesting reading,"This book was interesting in that it gives us a look at the early days of Taliban rule, and how it affected the people who had previously lived a much freer life. The writing style was a little strange for my taste, but I did finish it, as it was a pretty short book. I do not usually read a book for more than 2 or 3 chapters if I'm not fully engaged by that point."
5,Poetic and Haunting,"This book is a mesmerizing read. The adjectives that come to mind are ""poetic"" and ""haunting."" Months after finishing The Swallows of Kabul, I am still struck by its sophisticated simplicity; the author skillfuly navigates his four characters through the political, social, religious, and emotional turmoil of their shared existence to a climaxed ending."
4,Good Book,The Swallows of Kabul is an interesting story of the entanglement of the lives of two couples in Kabul. The first three-fourths of the book follow the two husbands closely as they coincidentally run into each other but never meet (somewhat like in Ulysses). Kabul is impoverished and the story takes place during Taliban rule and after the war with the Russians. All four of the characters struggle with living in Taliban ran Kabul and the question of existence develops into a poignant theme. The last fourth of the book moves to target the wives more and here the story became very predictable and I quickly began to lose interest. Khadra does have a rather peculiar writing style (or perhaps a result of the translation) where I found myself often feeling I was reading a play rather than a novel.
4,Great shorter story,"Great quasi-fictional story. I found myself not wanting to turn the page to find out what would happen, but so anxious to find out what locals really think of the Taliban. It's great how the author was able to intertwine the stories. Overall, I saw a beautiful love story that many people may not understand. I saw how culture and the Taliban can be so oppressive to their own people. I think this should be read in all high schools. It was an easy but very descriptive read and the message was conveyed clearly."
5,The Swallows of Kabul.....An astonishing work,"A sad, painful, haunting novel by Yasmina Khadra.This is the story of 4 people who live in Kabul: A Kabul that has degenerated into an urban economic and psychological wasteland under the Taliban.Then one event changes the course of the lives of these 4 people: bringing them into contact with one another and making all of them reflect and focus not only on the past but also what is happening to their somewhat ""safe"" present existence.The narrative is powerful, the story is exquisitely told. It will keep you turning the pages until you reach the conclusion.Highly recommended"
5,Breathtaking,"This book is extremely well-written and truly poetic. After reading The Kite Runner, I was amazed at how juvenile and silly Khadra's writing makes Hosseini's seem. This short novel shows that one can say more in 200 pages than others can say in 400."
1,The Swallows of Kabul,"There is not much I can say about this book except it is not worth the paper it is written on. I have read lots of books based on this region and none of them were this bad. There is very little story ( character wise ) and it is totally boring. I was very disappointed by the time I was 1/3 through it but still pressed on. What a waste of my time. Sorry, just saying !"
2,Misery..... disappointing read ....,"After reading The Kite Runner, a story about friendship, loyalty during the adverse times in Afghanistan during the Taliban, I was looking for another read centered on these harsh times in Afghanistan. The Swallows of Kabul was endorsed as book for those that enjoyed The Kite Runner however, disappointly, other than being set in Afghanistan the books similarities end there.I appreciated the descriptions about life during the Taliban rule. The author painted a vivid image on what it would have been like to walk down the street during these times. You felt sympathic towards the two couples, eventually their lives intertwined but not how you would have expected them. I was disappointed in the outcome of the story and was left with a feeling that the book was incomplete."
2,Keep looking,"I heard an interview with the author on NPR which piqued my interest in this story. I requested it at my local library. When I curled up to read, I was shocked and actually appalled by the first sentence, which I'll reproduce here: ""In the middle of nowhere, a whirlwind spins like a sorceress flinging out her skirts in a macabre dance; yet not even this hysteria serves to blow the dust off the calcified palm trees thrust against the sky like beseeching arms"" (1). If this sentence doesn't make you roll your eyes and check your calendar to see if it's overuse of adjectives and bad similie day, then you may like this book. I don't know if it's was ""lost in translation,"" but I couldn't get past the distracted writing."
4,52 Programs for Preschoolers,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone planning preschool programs. Each program suggests books, finger plays, poems and a craft. Everything is age appropriate. This would be a valuable resource for a library reading program or a preschool teacher."
3,Nice necklace needs better packaging,The necklace was nice but for the money I think it should have been delivered in a nicer package. I received it in a little plastic bag. This was for a present and I had to go out and get a nice box for the necklace. I also excepted it to be sparkly but it was dull.
3,"Loved the Fantasy, Hated the Sci-Fi","I really liked this series a lot until the story suddenly changed from Fantasy to full-blown Sci-Fi. (This happens a little further than halfway through the series, if I remember correctly.) Because I loved the characters so much I decided to keep going, but after a couple eps I was about ready to give up on it. Luckily the story soon returns to more of a fantasy emphasis and I was able to finish it up with a fair amount of enjoyment. But unfortunately, it did not recover enough for me to keep the series in my collection."
2,Like 2 Different Stories Put Together in 1 Series,"I rented the first disc(ep.1-4)and after watching it I then bought this collection at a great price. I thought the first 6 episodes of Scrapped Princess was really fun. It had a little bit of action, interesting characters and moved pretty quickly. I mean the story rarely fooled around. Then something happened. The characters stopped growing, the fun left and the story took on some kind of matrix feel. The cool side characters left and in came in my opinion dull and boring characters. It was like someone started the story and then gave it to someone else after episode 6. It got to a point where I really didn't care what happened to the characters (and the story) after episode 12. Anyway it looks like I'm in the minority here but I felt I needed to put up my opposing view so as too keep the rating honest. Just my opinion like everyone else."
4,Don't scrap this one. Keep it!,"At first glance this might appear somewhat of a silly anime...I watched Erementar Gerad before this one..so I was bit reluctant to try something else out thinking I would be disappointed like I was with EG...fortunately I'm a bit more open minded so I gave it shot. I must say I was glad I did. The story line and the characters are very likable and you'll get hooked by episode 5 at least. There isn't any great fighting scenes, so if you're expecting that, forget it. It's meant to be a somewhat drama/comedic type anime and it achieves that well. The voice acting in English and Japanese are well done as is the animation quality. Music lacks a bit, with the same ending (which is pretty good) and opening(which I couldn't stand) songs. A solid 4 anime. Recommended. Has some blood and violence, but nothing to say ""ehhh..looks painful"" a bit of fan service. Ok for 12 and up."
3,No Pictures,"I am rating this book low solely on the fact that it did not have pictures. Hopefully that is helpful to some. It seemed to contain a lot of good recipes, but I just couldn't get past the first few pages. If you are looking for a recipe book with a lot of recipes, this is probably the one to go with. But unfortunately for me, so many of the ingredients were tricky enough to find, that if I couldn't picture it, I wasn't sure that it was worth the effort."
4,Lionel Train Sets 1945-1969,"I think the book is real good, a little confusing but with time should be a great guide."
2,No HO information at all,I found my old HO gauge train set in the attic and wanted to learn more about it. Reading the info about this book you would think it covered all Lionel train sets. The truth is there is info about all sizes except HO. If HO is your interest look elsewhere.
5,MOST COMPREHENSIVE YET,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK FOR THE LIONEL COLLECTOR AND ENTHUSIAST!MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THAT SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT AND CLASSIC MODELS WERE GIVEN ONLY TINY PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PHOTO OF THE 773 HUDSON IS ABOUT 1/2"" X 1"" WHERE OTHER LESS IMPORTANT MODELS ARE GIVEN 1/8 OF A PAGE.OTHER THAN THAT, THE BOOK IS GREAT AND VERY ENJOYABLE TO THUMB THROUGH!"
1,Lame Deer Seeker of Wisdom,"I bought this book because the copy I started reading was a friend's and it was starting to fall apart. I didn't want to damage it anymore than it already was so I ordered a copy from Amazon's list of used book providers. I don't remember which company it was that I ordered from, but what I received was in such bad condition when I got it, I had to start paper clipping it together ONE day after I got it in the mail! What a mess it's been to try to read! The creepy thing is, when I opened the package, the book looked like it was in good shape, together, in one piece with no pages falling out. I don't know how they did it, but the company must have had it on their shelf for YEARS while the glue disintegrated and the cover separated from the pages and then not examined it before they sent it to me. One reason I ordered from this company, was the fact they are located in Reno, Nevada, where I live. I thought, because of that, I would get the book faster. I won't do that again."
4,A great book for anyone seeking Native Spirituality.,I came across this book when I first began studying Native American medicine. I enjoyed the authors experience with Lame Deer. The author told Lame Deer's story in a fair and balanced nature. I would recommend this book to everyone studying or interested in Medicine people. A good read...
4,"If you liked ""Black Elk Speaks"", this is for you.","This book was an excellent real-life story of a lakota medicine man, which has some interesting similarities to the book ""Black Elk Speaks"", which was an inspirational text for many people like me. I would have to say that without a doubt it reflects a time period very different to the story of Black Elk, so can be seen as a continuation of the often-sad story of the great Lakota people. This book would appeal to pretty pretty much anyone with an interest in Native American Spirituality, Animism, and anthropology dealing with Native Americana. Also people with an interest in biographic pieces of the early 20th century will enjoy this book, as also would those interested in the transitional phase of the era."
5,Ow Yea Sexy!!!!!!!!,This Is a very sexy outfit and if my Bratz doll Kaniya (Sasha) whears it she would be the sexyiest one and her boyfriend Breyon (Eitan) will love her even more. When I play Bratz school with my sister i will be the hottest and the sexyiset girl there and my best friend Kesse (Nevra) will wear the second outfit and we will be the sexyiset girls there. so if you want yo doll to be pritty buy this.
3,Makes your current seat better,"Easy to fit, remove and wash gel seat cover which makes your ride more comfortable."
2,comfortable but not durable,"I use this seat for spin classes, and it has already started to tear. It is very comfortable and I hope it will last. I've only used it for about 8-10 classes and there is already a hole in the back seam."
4,Works but may slide a little on smaller seats,"This seat is comfortable and works well. The only minor thing is on seats that are not super wide, it may slide a little from side to side. Otherwise it works perfectly."
2,Too Hard to relieve!,"It was my first time to buy a Gel cover, but I though that the idea is to make the seat softer, it actually didn't! on my first ride, I came home as sore as I used to be! I'm hoping this will change when I use it for a while"
4,softens the ride,I bought this to cover a rather hard bicycle seat. It has made a big difference in comfort on my bicycle.
4,Comfy Seat,The seat cover is comfortable compared to the original bicycle seat. It's one size fits all. If you have a hard seat on your bike this is perfect to soften the ride.
3,OKAY,"Not as good as I thought of it will be, but it is okay. I would settle for a better seat cover."
2,Seat Cover Failed in About 8 months,"I use the seat cover on a Schwinn exercise bike and ride it about 5 times a week for 20 minutes. I put a towel on it so that i don't have to wash it, so the failure is not from washing. Basically the gel pad has split in half in the middle and leave a big gap in the gel cushion right about where you sit. I would have thought it would last more than 8 months before failing. I need to replace it but am not very keen on buying the same one again."
4,gel seat-comfort,This seat worked on my larger bike seat which measures at the max recommended for this seat cover. I like it and it provides more comfort than just my regular oversized padded seat. Good value.
3,"Nice, but wrong size.","This is a comfy bike seat cover, but it did NOT fit the Marcy PL-43211 upright stationary bike that I bought it for."
2,Too small!,"I ordered this seat cover for my Schwinn 120 Upright Bike. The description said that it fits any regular bike seat and that the cushion could be adjusted, but sadly this is not so. The seat cover doesn't even come close to fitting my bike. It's weird that Schwinn makes seat covers that don't fit a standard Schwinn bike seat..."
4,Gel seat cover is great!,"This is such a relief! I can now ride my bike and keep up with my boys! It does move a little, but not enough to cause a problem when riding. The shipping took too long and was a bit steep, but the seat is a good buy."
2,you will need to replace in 2 years,"You will need to replace it in 2 years, the over material does not hold up. otherwise it is ok"
2,Does not fit the Schwinn upright exercise bike,"Just an FYI, it does not fit the Schwinn 150 Upright Exercise Bike. Found that out too late to return. Oh well, it didn't cost too much. But, a bit of a disappointment. Doesn't seem stable enough to put on my mountain bike, so likely a garage sale item in the future. Probably shouldn't list this next to the exercise bike as an accessory if it doesn't actually fit it."
1,Too small for Schwinn bike,"This seat cover was way too small for my stationary bike, so I had to return it."
3,Okay for the price,"Years ago I had a gel cover for my old bicycle seat and expected this would be a similar product. Instead I found this one to be not terribly cushy and kind of narrow, even for skinny ol' me. I suspected it would be best to buy a product like this in person and I should've gone with that. It's enough to get the job done but it is far from ideal."
5,Made cycle class enjoyable!,"Made cycle class enjoyable! My butt used to scream after sitting on the spin bike seat, this seat made class more bearable.Used bi-weekly."
1,oil leakage from the saddle seat,"In less than 6 month after I purchase this saddle seat, it started to leak some oily stuff out. After staining and destroying a couple of my pants, I started to realize that it is because of the leakage from the soft material in this saddle. This is while I am just 120 lbs (light load on the bike seat) and always used the bike in southern California weather (good weather conditions). I am totally unsatisfied with the quality of this prodect."
4,Good Value for money & excellent Cushioning,Just had went for my first ride..Very confi..I must have given 5 out of five...But then then the grip is not the best ...Its need some fixation of position after a long ride
1,Very little comfort provided,I purchased this seat cover for my spinning class after using one that was provided to me by my instructor. The one that I was given was great and provided and great deal of comfort (unfortunately I do not know the brand that she supplied). I purchased this cover that night after coming home and hoped for similar results. Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. It provided very little cushion or comfort. I would recommend purchasing a different seat cover which is what I now have to do.
1,False Advertising,"Amazon sells this seat cover in conjunction with the foldable exersize bike. I have no idea why, this thing doesnt even cover HALF of that seat. Big rip off if you are planning to buy that package deal."
5,"As usual, Ralph says it clearly.","In this treatise, Mr. Nader answers letters sent him by young Americans, and does so in his usual interesting style. It's worth reading no matter what political bent you have.Civic ArousalDon't let the title throw you off!"
1,Very disappointing,"I am a Nader voter and fan of CRASHING THE PARTY and THE GOOD FIGHT. This book is not worth even the reduced cover price. It is pointless babble in the form of letters from concerned (and uninformed) citizens, with Nader's preachy and unhelpful responses. Buy any other book from Nader and you will be happier."
5,A Big Help From The Library,"Baby Piggy loves her pacifier. She uses it every day. Then, one day, her baby-sitter asks her if she can play without it. Piggy tries to play without it for a few minutes, but she gets upset, so her baby-sitter gives it back. Until one day, Piggy realizes that none of her friends use a pacifier. From that day on, Piggy gave up her pacifier and her baby-sitter took it away. I got this book from our old local library and it helped my sister to say bye-bye to her pacifier."
4,A how-to for the amateur or knowledgable gardener,"This guide is useful whether you are just beginning to garden or have been gardening for years. Buchanan's suggestions for water gardens within the greater garden are brilliant and easy to follow and install. Her personal anectdotes add greatly to the pleasure of this book which is, incidentally, well-written and very readable."
2,El poder de La Ley,"Compré este disco porque oí en la radio la canción Tu Sabes Bien, en donde interviene el grupo La Ley. La canción es fantástica (o será más bien la intervención de La Ley?) Tuve mis dudas de comprar el disco pero me dijeron que valía la pena y que Ednita Nazario era una gran cantante. Qué error. No se si tendrá o no buena voz pero es otro estilo de música completamente distinto a La Ley. El disco se me hizo insoportable. Los temas de las canciones son estúpidos, superficiales y completamente simplistas. Hasta hay una canción que dice ""soy hielo bajo el sol sin tí"". Habrá algo más cursi? Cero profundidad. Tampoco hay nada de virtuosismo o innovación en lo que es la interpretación musical. Bueno, fue mi culpa. Ednita Nazario siempre ha interpretado ese tipo de música..."
5,very concerned,There is no mystery about Islamic culture since it is well documented for those who take the time to read about it.Fact.........Farewell Israel should be a wake up call to the Western world. Islam is anything but a peaceful religion. It has a history of constant bloodshed through out. It is against all religions and their intent is to dominate the world or destroy it.This not a fairy tale but a very serious documentary clearly detailing the threat to the west.
4,historical insights as backdrop to a dangerous future,"This documentary provides a clear understanding of Islamic thought and behaviors across the centuries. It then transitions to how and why western leaders have continually failed to appreciate and understand the basis for Islamic behavior, and proceed invariably to play into the hands of the worst elements from that world.It then projects the disasterous results if these patterns continue unchecked into the future.Some historical pieces of significance have been left out, as have more moderate Islamic points of view. Of course, the full treatment of the subject might have became less focused, too long, and less interesting. I would have like to see more suggestions how to deal successfully with the threats.It is an ambitious undertaking, and, neverthelss, successfully executed. Should be viewed by the foreign service of most countries, and the military strategic planners for Israel."
5,LIFTING THE VEIL,"FAREWELL ISRAEL lifts the veil of mystery thathas shrouded the Islamic culture from the Westernworld for many centuries. Joel Gilbert skillfullybobs and weaves through history to hit the highand low points of the struggles between twodistinctly different, yet scarily similar,ideologies. Gilbert lays out his research inmeticulous and painstaking detail, and viewersneed only add their own reasoning to thischronological cautionary tale.Those who believe the Bible is unfailing in itsaccuracy and authority will have some mightywrestling to do to reconcile their faith with theseemingly inescapable conclusion of this powerfulfilm. Those who have been paying little or noattention to what's been happening ""overthere"" will be jolted into awareness by thiscrash course in past, current, and coming events.No matter where you stand on the Arab-Israeliissue, your comfort zone will be invaded andoccupied by FAREWELL ISRAEL."
2,Scissors and comb...,"Scissors and comb came in a zip lock bag, not a sealed package. Not what I expected. Too much of a hassle to return. Used?"
4,pro carpenter,"purchased this item four years ago and became spoiled by the superior performance of the carbide tips. the carbide does away with the metal dulling efects of the heat caused by todays composit materials. unfortunatly, on a recent high end installation it rolled behind a just scribed and installed very large sink cabinet. not wanting to risk damage to cabinet and surounding finishes i decided to bite the bullet and leave it there. thats where the four instead of five star rating comes in. after several previous purchases from amazon, all of sudden they have the wrong credit card #s on my account. furthermore, can some wiser person than me explain why ""free 2 day shipping"" on an instock item sold by amazon takes 6 days! the delays and bungling have soured this purchasing experiance. its important that amazon realize how dependant we tradespeople are on our tools, even a twelve dollar countersink."
2,"Unfortunately, this is the best you can get in English.","The Story of the 3 Kingdoms is a great one, filled with memorable characters and events. However, this translation is aweful. Filled with numerous errors, starting with the title written in characters on the front! It's gone through a Japanese filter and is a corrupted translation of a great story. It's too bad that this is about the best you can get in English. My advice if you want to read this story? Learn Chinese. Brewitt-Taylor has no clue."
4,interesting charachters,"When i was reading this book, I was thinkng about ""our town"", where the narrator gives us a glimpse into several interesting lives. i have never lived or spent much time in bombay. that being said, i am not quite sure that bombay deserve star billing in the title or connectiveness to these stories. each story (except the first) has compelling charachters that you feel interested in and want to know more about. by the way, in the last story is subramaniam shiv?"
3,Praise is way overblown,"The stories are moderately interesting. The language is so pretentious, you often forget how a sentence started by the time it ends (that's what put me off red earth and pouring rain too). I would barely recommend this book for a long flight."
1,"Dirty city, boring book","Mr. Chandra's creation, from the title onwards, is a ruefully falsified description of the city of Bombay, one of the most banal and dirtiest cities in Asia, as is well known. The author's words and ideas apply to any reasonably peaceful, affluent Latin or South American city, which can given scale and space to the fanciful stories contained in this collection. Bombay has no such capacity; it only breaks down people into miniatures of themselves, to the level of the grim and the persistent human defecation abound in public places. Frankly, very few Indian people would bestow Bombay its own book. They know how dehumanizing the city has become, and perhaps always was. It is perhaps the most emblematic Asiatic city. Read Mr. Chandra's book, but know that it contains no truth."
3,Witty and spicy to make the grey matter tingle.....,"Chandra's obvious use of real characters is the high point of this book. Be it the hypocrisy of Bombays' high society or the subtleties of marathi middle class behaviour, the author uses a vast array of controlled writing techniques to explore the enigma that is now called Mumbai. The theme in all his novellas centres around the tortured soul and its travails. There is indeed a hint of the self that the author lets slip by... Chandra has a discerning eye for detail that makes his characters and the city come ot life."
5,Love and Longing in Bombay,"Love and Longing in Bombay: StoriesThis book was the one that introduced me to the gifted Vikram Chandra who I had never heard of. I was favorably impressed by his turn of the prhrase in these marvelous short stories that all come together at the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes short stories. This is set in India in the past (early to mid 20th century, I believe), and I have discovered a new love for reading books about India through this book. Buy it. You won't be disappointed. I've since bought other books by Vikram Chandra and he's a great author. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Fancy Frosting, Not Much Cake","The language is flashy and original, but the old-fashioned skills are lacking: the author does not create fully engaging characters, and the plots are weak. Nor, oddly, does he convey the feeling and atmosphere of Bombay. The female characters, especially, are cardboard cutouts -- the lady in the long sex scene is almost a soft-core parody."
4,Good,This book will be an interesting read for anyone who has ever lived in Bombay. The stories are contemporary and the modern-day Bombayite would find himself/herself in one of the characters. A good attempt by Chandra. - Proma Ray
3,one time read !,"I read these characters sometime ago. The five chapters ""Dharma"", ""Shakti"", ""Kama"", ""Artha"" and ""Shanti"" seemed reasonable means of understanding the authors work. I vaguley remember the story except for the fact that an old man was narrating these stories in a corner of a room or hotel. It is quite a lot about Bombay. One thing for sure, while reading these stories, they do catch your attention. But the endings of these stories were some what disappointing."
5,Beautiful Teapot,"The teapot was more beautiful than it appeared online. I have decorated my kitchen/dining area in bluebonnets and butterflies. This teapot has a blue flower that reminds everyone of my bluebonnets and blends in nicely with them. The painted butterflies have beautiful details and the butterfly on the lid appears almost real. I was hosting a table at a Ladies Luncheon, and we were to decorate our tables with anything we collected. The only stipulation was we had to include a teapot in the decorations somehow. I used many of my butterflies that I have collected over the years in all types of displays. I had pictures, real butterflies encased in shadow boxes, porcelin, brass, lace, and crystal butterflies. The focal point of my display was the beautiful teapot! Everyone at the luncheon loved it. I've got it proudly displayed in my antique china cabinet my mother gave me this year."
1,.,"""People who thought they couldn't draw - but after learning from this book the work was pro quality. "" This reviewer has managed to stuff portraiture into a neat little shake and bake package.Of course their art would look ""pro"" if a teacher is behind you correcting each line out of place! However,creating portraits of people, by yourself is something which requires practice, hundreds and hundreds of hours. I don't think it is fair to say that this book will make beginners, ""pro"". That is wishful thinking and a total belittlement of art! I have to agree with the first review, the art does look mediocre. It would probably suit a beginner, but obviously disappoint someone a little more skilled."
4,Concise slick book. Good but not great.,"This is not an easy book to read. It starts off with field theory and assumes a lot of knowledge, especially from Landau's books on fluid mechanics and statistical physics. The format of the writing is concise, almost journal publication style. Chapter 14 on angular momentum and vortices is very slick and hard to follow. Chapter's 7 and 8 on response theory and 4He introduce a lot of notation and constructs without definition or motivation. Their discussion of mean field theory in BEC, derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii from the operator formalism, and discussion of Fermi gases is clearer than in the BEC book by Pethick and Smith. There is also a discussion of optical lattices and low dimensions that is not discussed in Pethick and Smith. The other standard topics such as dynamics of a BEC in a harmonic trap are covered better in Pethick and Smith. Cooling is not discussed in this book."
5,Story of courage and determination,"This book will open the eyes of any American to the suffering and poverty that women of Afghanistan have gone through for decades. It is the story of not one, but many courageous women and men and their ongoing effort to turn their country into a democracy.This book is warm and enduring. It is eye-opening. It is a true human interest story. This is what reporters should be reporting on. Not Michael Jackson, or Martha Stewart or anything else.I would read this book again and again and again if I had the time."
5,A Heroine's Journey To Inspire Us All,"This gripping tale of a young woman's progress from idealistic student to the leader of a secret women's movement in Afghanistan should be required reading in all American high schools. Though Meena paid for her bravery with death, her heroism and courage are truly uplifting. The dramatic story is well narrated by Ermachild, who clearly has great empathy for her subject. I recommend this book highly, and not just for young adults; this story will touch any reader who can identify with the struggle for freedom and justice."
3,Review,"This product doesn't do what they promise but it is anice moisturizer and doesn't have a strong perfumey smelllike so many others which is why I use it.The packaging is bad, the pump doesn't work and I havehad to use Q-tips to get the product out on every bottle."
1,"Pixar, what happened?","I don't understand why this was one of the highest-rated movies of the year. What were the critics thinking? This is not up to Pixar and Brad Bird's standards, not by a long shot, but they have set the bar pretty high and I suppose their wave of success had to break eventually. Maybe it's because they lost their good-luck charm -- I was listening for John Ratzenberger and didn't hear him anywhere.Don't worry, Pixar! I still have faith in you. Get up, dust yourself off, and make the next one great. Surely it will have to be better than this one."
1,Its horrible!,"Its a horrible ripoff of ""Pixar Ratatouille."" Everything about this movie are horrible, the animation is terrible, the story is garbage and the voices are horrible. The plot in this movie is different from Pixar Ratatouille. Three mices owns a restaurant and there are a group of spy mices who wants to know what their formula for the food they make. No need for me to say more, because like I said, the story is garbage. The name Ratatoing is undeniably the worst movie name I have ever heard in my life. It shouldn't exist, so stay away from this movie. Get Pixar Ratatouille instead."
3,not a giant,"My primary disappointment with this Bible is the text size. While I could justify calling it large print, I cannot agree with its being labeled giant! It is readable, but I did really expect larger print. The cover and other binding details are quite nice for the price and I do really appreciate the concordance being set in the same size type. All in all, it seems a good value, but because of the giant label I do feel a bit misled. It was also physically smaller, though it is quite thick. Many people would probably prefer a taller and wider volume with less thickness. A great buy if this is the size you are looking for, but be aware giant is a misnomer here."
5,High Quality at Low Cost,I am a preacher and I use the New King James Version to achieve a balance between those who grew up with the King James and feel most comfortable with it and those who are younger and need a friendlier version. I need large print as I'm getting up in years. My previous Bible was the same as this one -- only it had tabs to help locate specific books of the Bible. I don't need the tabs. My previous Bible gave me many years of service. I expect the same from this one. The seller got this brand new Bible to me in a very short time and in perfect condition.
4,"Excellent format, translation, notes, readability.",This is my daily Bible. It is about the same size as a Scofield Reference/Study Bible with print twice the size. I prefer this Bible because it has some unique features:* Compact for transportation. * Large print that I can easily read in my lap. * Read-along references and alternate translations. * No distracting center column wasting space. * The only literal modern translation based on the Textus Receptus. * Unbiased easy to understand textual notes. * Excellent introduction to Bible translation philosophy.One drawback is that it is not as durable as the Scofield (though it will still last for years). The concordance and maps sections should be larger (but are adequate) too...
4,NICE FOR BEGINNERS,"GOOD FOR BEGINNERS.SHOWS MANY POSITIONS TO GAINTHE BENEFITS OF FLEXIBILITY,STRENGTH AND FUN.RECOMMENDED."
4,Effective workout,I have worked out sporadically on the stability ball for several years. Always with written instruction. This video does an excellent job of putting together a routine that is challenging yet doable even for the pilates beginner. There are a couple exercises I can't do yet but I'm sure with a few more weeks of work I will master them.
3,Not a Beginners Workout,"I got into the balance ball via my chiropractor and love the core training that I got from physical therapy. I wanted to expand on that and have looked for ""beginner"" DVD's. This claimed to be for beginners but it is not for anyone who isn't already at least partly fit. There is no work up to this work out, in other words when you hit play it is full speed ahead! The moves are challenging not for someone who isn't used to working out. I knew going in that Pilates was a challenging form of exercise; I wasn't however prepared for the speed in which this workout moves. I am keeping this DVD and will use it later after I have toned up more but I would not suggest it to anyone that hasn't worked out in a while!"
3,Good if you tried pilates before,"It's a good video, but if you've never done pilates before you have to be careful, you may experience some pain in the neck, be careful and try to consult with a pilates trainer before using the video, you may hurt yourself!"
5,"Easy, short, sweet and informative",This is a great 1/2 hour workout and she's a great teacher. I want a bod like hers!
3,Don't buy if you're uncoordinated.,"This is definitely not a tape for you if you aren't very coordinated or if you are just beginning to work out. It is probably great if you've used a stability ball before but if you haven't some of the exercises are a bit too challenging. Therefore, I generally will choose another DVD that I can actually feel like I am accomplishing something rather than just fighting to stay on the ball. :)"
5,very good dvd.,"The instructor is always with you. It seems a little hard in the beginning, but after 3 sethiones you feel good. The video very profetinal. I hardly reccomend it."
2,Ballates Doesn't Cut It,I'm a certified instructor who studied the East Coast (original) style of Pilates. My teacher training program required over 750 hours of training. Here's the bottom line: Joseph Pilates NEVER taught is method with a ball. It's time to look back to the real method and pan for real gold. No fools gold for me.
2,For beginners only! Was boring and far too easy,"If you're looking for a challenging or difficult Pilates DVD, this is not it! Was incredibly disappointed and will be returning it."
3,Not for True Beginners,"As a pure workout ball beginner, I found this DVD to be very difficult and complicated. I can tell the exercises are effective and useful, but it's very difficult to get the hang of this without any experience with Pilates or the ball. I suggest something simpler and slower if you are an uncoordinated beginner like I am!"
4,More Challenging than mat workouts,This workout is more challenging than other pilates floor workouts. The pilates movements are basic but incorporating the stability ball makes them challenging. Great beginner stability ball workout.
1,A flawed video for sure.,"I used to do windsor pilates, I think my video was with Daisy Fuentes. I thought it would be fun to do a workout on my stability ball but I was totally wrong! There is no lower-impact option... which is especially nice when you're just starting out. She also sometimes says the wrong word and doesn't correct herself, so it's hard to understand what you're supposed to be doing.Biggest problem: If you're above 5'6"" (I'm 5'8"") you get a slightly bigger stability ball. This workout doesn't have that larger stability ball in mind. Some of the moves are impossible because of the size of the larger ball. This is a problem for me and I wish I would have just bought a dvd copy of windsor pilates to replace my old vhs. What a waste of ten dollars!"
5,Awesome and Fun,"I'm a personal trainer and I think this video is so fun you don't realize you're working out, yet you'll feel a burn the next day! Other great Pilates videos are:Yoga Plus (by denise Austin)EASYIntermediate Pilates (by Gaiam)NOT TO HARDPilate for Every Body (by Denise) more challengeingStrong and Streamlined(Stott) most challengingHope this helps"
2,Not for beginners,"I have done Pilates for some time and also worked with the balance ball so I thought it would be interesting to put the two together, and as I hadn't done that before I thought a beginner program would help. This is definitely not for beginner's. The exercises will be difficult for someone with little to moderate abdominal strength. The program goes fast with no allowance for different levels. A good workout for experienced Pilates."
5,great beginners workout with a great teacher!,"lizbeth is a great teacher- for some reason this is one of the few workout videos where there instructor doesn't annoy me. i think the workout is great- its a constant buildup, offering challenges for the growing advancement. I love her she layers the workouts, challenging several different muscle groups. i LOVE this!"
5,good work out,I have never done pilates before or used a fitness ball. It moved at slow pase for proper body mechanics and still got a good workout.
3,Not really for Beginners,"I agree with those who state that this workout is really not for beginners. I consider myself a true beginner. I have five children, so my abdominal and lower back muscles are practically non-existant, and I haven't worked out in years. I heard so much about Pilates that I wanted to try it. As a beginner, I found that I simply could not do some of the exercises. It was clear to me that these exercises required you to have good abdominal and lower back muscles, which are usually found on someone who is already in fairly good shape, not a beginner like me.That's not to say that this workout is not good. If you can do all the exercises, I think you will get a good workout. If you are a true beginner like me, start elsewhere and work your way up to this one."
3,Most useful for first time moms,"This is a baby book. The picture of babies on the front should convey that, but since the subtitle claims it is a guide ""from pregnancy through the school years,"" I was expecting a little more spectrum. You'll be 80% through the book before finishing the first year. If you're having twins and already have one or more children, much of this book will be information you don't need. I was also a little annoyed by the ""top five lists."" Most of them are simply random comments from moms of twins. It seemed odd to rank these.But the writing is smooth and we can all benefit from the experience of other moms. There are some interesting ideas in the book and if you are working on a twin library, this might have a place."
3,"Been there, Done that","My identical twin girls turned 2 in September. I bought this book when they were about 4 months old. It's taken me a while to get around to commenting as I've been, well, kind of busy although it does indeed get easier. I found some of the information helpful, some obvious. When I read the comment about the possibility of the two babies crying at the same time discussed as: ""Actually that doesn't happen too often..."" you could probably hear me close the book. Honestly, with the best care and complete attention, it happens OFTEN! They are two people who want ALL of your attention NOW! It's understandable and still very challenging. Would I want it any other way? Absolutely not, but it's still exhausting and sometimes very frustrating. Twins are not double the experience. It is exponentially harder and exponentially sweeter. More hugs and love and more fuss. My answer to this? Take a deep breath and love them more."
3,"A quick, simple read","This quick read would be ideal for a tired new mom, who needs the occasional quick reference, however as a pregnant mom with a bit of time on my hands I was left wanting something more in depth. Included are lots of ""Top Five"" lists, quick and easy recipes, and basic survival advice, but the book still feels like a compilation of simple parenting magazine articles. It's hard to get into depth, when you're covering pregnancy through the school years in 191 pages. I recommend this book only to parents who are looking for a basic, light read that summarizes early life with twins."
4,Good Book!,I would recommend this book to anyone who is expecting twins. It is definately written as a guide. I liked the fact that it gave you different perspectives on a multitude of issues. It gives you advise and/or good ideas while allowing you to decide which way is best for you and your twins.
2,Not durable enough for the average youngster.,"I had the same problem another reviewer did. My daughter stood on her vacuum and wiggled the handle back and forth (like she was having a ride) and the plastic housing holding the handle broke off. I didn't contact Bissell in the one year time, in fact I didn't contact them at all. Maybe I should still give it a try. It was real fun and worked well other than that, but this made it unusable (no more handle). So if you get one, good luck trying to keep them from ""riding"" it. It just seems to be a kid thing."
2,DOESN'T HOLD CHARGE,MY 5 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES THIS VACUUM THE ONLY PROBLE IT DOESN'T HOLD A CHARGE I CHARGE IT OVER NIGHT AND MAYBE LASTS 15 MIN CAN ANYONE HELP.....
2,Not Worth It,"Ok so I thought why not, it wasn't that much $$$$, it was some of the lamest acting I have ever seen, not that it was supposed to be an oscar award winnging epic film, but come one, The sex scenes were short, and not even remotly considered as a soft adult movie. I would save your $$$$, wish I would've."
3,Sinful Deeds AKA Wicked Intentions,This is a softcore (late-night) T&A movie. Typical for this genre of movie. It has a plot in that strippers from one strip club are coming up missing A stripper (Syren) hires a PI to investigate. This movie will win no film awards but for fans of late night (Cinemax) skin flix's it is better than average.
1,not worth the cost to make,"This movie is only good for one thing: the trash bin to be recycled. Unnecessary sex and poor acting. Thirty minutes was more than enough. I turned it off. Don`t even buy it for five cents, it`s not worth the cost of postage."
1,Forgettable Porn,"This was classic moderate-core porn without even throwing in a decent plot. If you're going to go for skin and sex, you should at least be entitled to some decent physiques to be enthralled by. However, this fly-by-night flick has no decent-looking babes and no plot. That inevitably leads to the question:why should I waste my time and money on such drivel?"
4,"Perfectly funtional, good value","It's a little deeper, i.e. it sticks out further from the wall than I would have liked, but other than that it's perfectly functional. It was a cost savings to buy this bracket and rack-mount patch panel vs. a surface mount patch panel, so that's a plus. By flipping the bracket over, the hinge can be on the left or right. I've had to ""open"" the bracket a few time to punch down more cables and the bracket has held up fine to this use."
3,1 out of 3?,I have purchased three of these items and two were just fine. The one I had trouble with must have come apart before or during shipping. To be specific the hinge part of the bracket which is secured by some type of glue came loose and caused some minor issues when the super glue I used to fix it came apart again after installation. I re-glued it again and have not returned to that job site.
3,WWE Armageddon 2003 review,"The Booker T-Mark Henry match was not great but pretty good. The Intercontinental Title match between Randy Orton & Rob Van Dam was pretty boring for the first half but the last 8 minutes picked up nicely. The Boys vs. Girls tag team match between the team of Chris Jericho & Christian against the team of Trish Stratus & Lita was disgusting,disgraceful & distasteful. The Batista-Shawn Michales match was also not great but pretty good. The Matt Hardy-Maven match never really started due to Batista's Stubbornness to leave the ring so I can't really review it. The Tag Team Turmoil match had some solid action to say the least but it could have done better. The Women's title match between Molly Holly & Ivory was just filler and I'm putting it nicely. The 3 Way bout for the Worlds title(Bill Goldberg vs. Kane vs. Triple H) was just a long & drawn-out series of power moves to say the least. I give this ppv a 5 out of 10."
3,Armageddon 2003 was an ok PPV,1. Booker T vs Mark Henry. 3/5This match was nothing special.2. Intercontinental Championship MatchRVD vs Randy Orton. 3.5/5This match was ok.3. Womens Championship Match 1/5This match was dumb. They should have taken it out.4. Batista vs Shawn Michaels 4/5This match was on of the best matches of the night.5. Battle of the Sexes. Chris Jericho & Christain vs Lita & Trish Stratus. 1.5/5This match was pointless.This PPV could have ben better without it.6. The tag team tourmoil. 3.4/5This match was a pretty good match untill the end.7. The World Heveyweight Championship Match 4/5This was one of the best matche of the night by far.Over all this PPV was ok. Evolution walked out with all the gold though. Over all I give this PPV a 3/5
1,The Worst PPV I Have Ever Seen,"Evolution won every single title on this line, which was a good thing, because they were giving all of the bad guys the titles heading into Wrestlemania 20. But the bad part about this ppv, every single match SUCKED!!! Not one match even was able to hit an 8/10. It was horrid! Well, at least back then John Cena wasn't World Champion. That's REALLY pathetic. This ppv really really sucked, and whoever enjoyed it probably has enjoyed every single wrestling ppv ever put on. The worst ppv I have ever seen match quality wise, and there wasn't much storylines heading into the ppv either."
2,Raw fails to deliver yet another PPV,Bad Blood sucked!This one is worse!!!The only match worth watching was the HBK match and the main event......Booker T vs Mark Henry...boring...1/10Christain & Chris Jericho vs Lita & Trish Stratus...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! 1/10!!!!Batista vs Shawn Michaels.....HBK is the man! 9/10WWE Intercontinental championshipRob Van Dam vs Randy OrtonMic Foley Ref...Good match....9.2/10WWE Womens titleMolly Holly vs Ivory....very poor match..2/10WWE World tag team championsLa Resistance vs The Hurricane & Rosey vs Val venis & Lance Storm vs Mark Jinjrak & Garrison cade vs Dudley Boyz vs Scott Steiner & Test vs Ric Flair & Batista 4/10WWE World HeavyweightChampionshipGoldberg vs Triple H vs Kane 9/102.8 out of 10.....Worst Armaggedon ever so far!Later.....
1,Cheap fun only,Don't buy this DVD or VHS unless it is really cheap or you particularly like heals in wrestling (cause that is all that happended at this event).
2,Armageddon 2003,"I'm not going to give this event a whole review, because it doesn't deserve it. Let me say one thing: Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam fighting for the IC Title is the only reason to even rent this tape. The Triple Threat matched was barely even hyped up, it was almost like HBK/Batista was their money match, that match was decent, but nothing special. RVD/ORTON = CLASSIC BATTLE FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP = Only reason to even rent this pile of dung"

1,Quit,"QUIT IT WITH THE FAKE REVIEWS. THE PPV DOESN'T HAPPEN TILL DECEMBER 14 2003. It's annoying, false advertsing(So quit it). It is being shown live on Pay Per View,it is being shown on premiere in Germany. It is also being shown on Sky Sports 1 Live in the U.K."
1,It should be 0 stars but i cant put 0.,My rating out of *****(matches may not be in order)1. mark henry vs.bookerT: an okay match one of the nights best but not very fun- rating **2.

I think triple h ruined monday nights!- rating **dont buy but rent!
1,A disappointment,"This book and tape set was somewhat of a disappointment. The female vocalist in the audio recording valiantly attempts to sing Chinese lyrics to familiar American children's tunes. In this case it just doesn't work. The lyrics sound like they were ""squeezed"" into the music. Many of the tunes are completely out of rhythm. My children were also turned off by the singer's voice which is somewhat high pitched and grating. It would have been nice if the songs were set to Chinese melodies instead of western tunes. When learning a foreign language why not also learn the music of that culture as well?"
1,"Disorganized book, nice audio.","I got this hoping it'd help me improve my Mandarin since I only know Cantonese Chinese. It was a great disappointment.The audio portion is lovely, but the book that accompanies it is poorly organized. It does not contain all the lyrics in Chinese characters, and you need to flip back and forth in the book to get the ""additional lyrics"" in pinyin. The English translations are in the back of the book, so you cannot cross-reference meanings easily either.The pictures and vocabulary words in between each singing section are cute and useful, but I would not recommend this CD and book set to anyone wanting to learn Mandarin Chinese."
1,Major Disappointment,"My kids screamed, ""Turn it off! Please!"" They could not stand listening to the very high pitched and out of tune voice. Needless to say, Teach me Chinese did not work for my children. I have had better luck with Sing 'n Learn Chinese."
3,No Photos!!!!!,"I am a photographer and was really looking forward to seeing the ""dramatic photographs"" that ""frequently overshadow Davis's informative, witty essays"". Other than the book cover, there is not a single photograph in the book. Not one. I ordered four copies based on my expectation that there would be photographs as well as essays, so I was very disappointed. I have since read the book, and it is well-written, heart-felt, thought-provoking and fascinating. I just suggest that the write up be changed to be less misleading."
1,Utter Disappointment,"I ordered this tray for a wedding gift. I was pleasantly surprised at the fast shipping from The Bowl Company. However, when I opened the item, I noticed an obvious flaw on the tray. Also, there appears to be swirl marks on the tray giving it a dull appearance, unlike all of the other Wilton pieces in my collection. It appears to be of ""B"" or ""C"" grade stock or possibly a previous return. I contacted the seller and they offered a replacement/refund after I ship the tray back. Since I will not be able to receive in time for the wedding, I'm out double shipping costs - for nothing. Save yourself time and effort and only buy Wilton from a real retailer."
1,Incorrect Description,"The description of the product written by the seller says it works on Windows 2000 but it does not. On the back of the actual CD packaging, it only says it works on Windows Vista/XP, Me, 98."
3,"Ok software, comes in just a jewel case.",The Cluefinders Math Adventures software is ok but it would be nice to have a manual or a how to play the game. It is pretty straight forward but you will have to stumble around a few spots in the game to figure it out. Overall if I had to buy the software over again I would look for the full retail package and not just the CD.
2,"boring, not intense enough",I did this video once and can't bring myself to try it again. It just didn't do it for me. Lindsay Brin's is MUCH better! I think I will probably sell it or give it away. Don't waste your money unless you are looking for a LIGHT workout.
2,ehhh. it's ok,"i have been somewhat into working out for a few years but this video, even though im pregnant, is just too boring. it didnt really get my heart rate going, i wasnt at all into, it went by really slow and im going to buy kathy smiths older video because i have heard better things about it."
1,Very boring and unimaginitve,I bought this after reading the reviews online and was very disapointed with the video. There are only a few diferent moves and it is extremely repetitive. Not very fun at all. Truthfully I am extremely disapointed with this purchase. Not a good video.
2,Not for Everyone,"I was very disappointed in this postnatal workout DVD. I began using the yoga portion at just a few days postpartum. As a yoga practitioner of several years, I can honestly say it in no way resembled any yoga I had ever participated in - it was just a few poses over and over again. Terrible. As I regained strength, I tried the dance/cardio segments. I'm sure would have liked them if I had any background in aerobics or dance, but I don't, so I had no idea what she was talking about and she didn't describe it very well (what, for example, is a grapevine?). The pilates section required props, as did the yoga, which I did not have on hand at my house. If you are serious about yoga, or have limited dancing and aerobics background, or don't have the room or $$ to buy a bunch of props, this is probably not the DVD for you. I will give Leisa props for being high-energy and for the DVD including multiple types of workouts, but overall it was a waste for me."
5,"fun and to the point, Fitmama is FANTASTIC","i love the no non-sense attitude of this workout, there is no wasted time and the workouts are very fun and easy to follow...i started feeling better after having my baby the day i started using Leisa Hart's video, FITMAMA IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!"
5,great workout,"I love Leisa Hart's choreography and the Postnatal Fitmama is great, just what my body needs to get back into shape....I also enjoy the FitMama & Me baby workouts, that is adorably fun."
2,Very disappointed,"The idea behind this program is good, and I was really hoping for a good video, but I have to say that I was unfortunately really let down. The exercises are not very challenging, the instruction is not very clear, and the video itself is extremely short (especially the ""Fitmama & Me"" part, where you actually workout with your baby -- what should get the most time I think).If you collect exercise tapes, this one can't hurt -- but if you're really looking for an effective post-pregnancy workout, unfortunately this video does not deliver. I'm putting mine on e-bay and looking for other videos."
4,I liked it,"I liked this workout video because it does a good job of easing the body back into exercise. Leisa is a fun and good instructor and I didn't get tired of working out to this even after working out to it 3 times a week for 4 weeks. It is too easy once your body is back into shape, but it was fabulous at the begining."
3,Assertiveness revealed,There are practical applications and descriptive examples of the different behavioral types that I found useful and interesting. The reasons given for people adopting their behavior types make sense. Also the means for dealing with others from an assertive standpoint are well laid out.Overall a useful workbook that at the very least helps one understand conflict resolution.
3,"Good information, but","I read this book after reading Too Nice for Your Own Good. I found this book to be very informative and seemingly comprehensive, but didn't hit on topics I related to. Perhaps ""niceness"" is a variation in the assertiveness training world. I didn't do the work, because I didn't buy into the premises for each topic. I do believe that there is a market for this book, though, and that this book will be very good for that market."
2,Kindle version is a waste of money,"This book is well written but its absolutely pointless getting the Kindle version as many parts of the book requires you to write on it. Don't waste your money, just get the actual book!"
5,This book is great for myself!,"I am working on this topic right now. I read before another book that was difficult for me to take into action. This workbook gave me the intellectual material to ruminate and at the same time a clear path of action to follow. This is a difficult topic for me, the last feeling that I want have is feeling lost. This book provides with the general vision of where I am going, what it takes, and and the specific details of how to do it."
3,Excellent but...,"The first 2/3rds of this book provides excellent advice for the nonprofessional investor and backs it up with facts. I wish I had known this stuff 30 years ago and did not have to learn it the hard way. The last part of the book was troubling in that it provides information re using margin accounts and then seems to drift off course to using brokers. Margin accounts are too dangerous for the investor to whom this book is directed and using a broker seems a misstep on the path to creating a S&P 500 index fund investment which is the point of the book. Also, a great deal of this book seems to be a duplication of information from ""Bogle on Mutual Funds"" which is THE definitive work on index fund investing but is not even mentioned in the suggested reading list provided in this book. You might want to read Jack Bogle's book first or instead (Bogle started the Vanguard fund family)"
1,"Bad Theology, Bad Book","Dan Corner boasts about writing the most exhaustive refutation to eternal security ever written"" with 801 ""shocking"" and ""blockbuster"" pages. This book is quite easily refuted by simply reading the Bible instead of reading into the Bible what isn't there; Eternal Insecurity in Dan Corner's case. The author's ill-guided crusade has a very faulty foundation based upon a complete misunderstanding of mankind's fall in the Garden of Eden. From there he continues to build his doctrine on a false and very humanistic free will presupposition. Indeed, this book Semi-Pelagian Arminianism to the core. I truly feel sorry for anyone who reads this book, believes it, and then lives the remainder of their life wondering each day if they were good enough to maintain their salvation. What a sad existence."
4,James Axler has done it again with a tremendous book.,This book is another prime example of James Axler writing. He makes you picture what it is like to live in a world of mutants and villians. A must read book for any James Axler fans. You will not be disappointed.
1,1 star is too many!,"When I picked this book up I couldn't wait to read it. I should have waited. I think this was the WORST book I've ever read. The whole book is about zombies from the sea that keep a village hostage in an old fort. Big Deal. The end of the book he blows up the fort as a sacrifice. The little boy in the story, keeps telling the father about something in the basement, but you never find out what it was. Why? Simon Clark should put his pencils away and read a real author like Dean Koontz."
3,Didn't Thrill Me,"This book would have been more effective had it been shorter. I quickly tired of the Saf Dar, wishing there'd been more action sooner.I was extremely annoyed that every time a piece of information was about to be revealed, someone interrupted. Chris was about to show his wife the shells his son had given him, but she cut him off. His son was about to take him into the basement, and someone interrupted. It happens all through the book.Chris is a terribly henpecked husband. His wife raises a finger and he knows to obey. His son is the typical horror novel kid: Smarter and more mature than his age. Why can't kids be kids?The ending was interesting; this wasn't a horrible book. But it was frustrating getting to the end. Finally, maybe it was just that I got a copy from a bad batch of printed books, but virtually every instance of ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."" left off the period. It was very annoying. Overall, I felt this book was a *sacrifice* of my time."
2,"Clark, Nailed By The Heart","Nailed By the Heart is better as far as my Clark experiences go but I still did not find it good. I found it to be mediochre at best. It's one of those books that has a great beginning but then unravels for me into a giant mess with only a scene here and there being interesting to me. Books involving drowning in any form always creep me out (John Saul's The Unloved had a horrifying dead body in ocean scene) and this book had some ""stay away from the shoreline"" stuff, but nothing groundbreaking. Nothing special here but I'm sure fans of Simon Clark would like it. It is his first novel after all."
1,"""Nailed"" Left Me Numb","The title caught my attention. The plot rather intrigued me. However, Simon Clark's debut left me numb and nauseous. Not from the horror. From his overly descriptive clumbsy writing, (how many ways should one describe clouds?), repetitive cliches, and lack of control of leading the reader to emotional curiosty.In ""Nailed By The Heart"" we meet a family that buys a seafort in England. A village of weird characters. And the Saf Dar. A supposed religious group of horrific murderers. Half way through the book I found myself saying, ""Ok, get on with it already!"" and skipped to the last chapter. It was as if I had not missed a thing. The conclusion is sappy. And unfortunately, I just cannot recommend this book.Thanks--CDS"
1,Coleman Wateproof Pouches - Set of 3,"I am extremely disppointed in this purchase. I have owned waterproof pouches in the past and use the quart sized ones quite extensively in my air travels. The pouches from Coleman tear way too easiy at the point of attachment between the velcro liner and the main body of the pouch. When this occurs, the pouch is no longer waterproof and liquids can flow either out of or into the pouch.I will not purchase these again."
1,ZOMG Horrible,"Well, I am no huge country fan, but my tastes are rather eclectic, and I enjoy a wide range of styles/genres.However, I am being unwittingly forced to listen to this song 4-5 times a workday by the local country stations, that, were it not for this god-awful single, would be rather enjoyable.Country fans, don't let the record labels dictate what is possible. I had hoped there was some vestige of intelligence left in the segment."
4,i loved her first cd,wonderful cd great songs brought it for i loved her first but all the other songs are just as great.
5,Great songs,Great songs!! Great that downloads to all cloud devices.Was able to put on my phone and on ALL my kindle fires!!
2,It has it's ups and downs,I was mainly looking for this cd for my wedding to find a great father/ daughter dance song. The cover song I loved her first did just that. It is a fantastic song. The rest of the cd is kind of weird something I'll listen to but not very often.
5,Perfect for Creme Brulee or other custards or Yogurt,"These are simply the best containers for making creme brulee. They are a perfect single serving size. They hold up to the heat and never discolor or change the taste of the food.In fact I have even been served these exact Ramekins in a restaurant, that should speak to their quality. We also use them to serve sauces when we serve buffet style or for holding measured ingredients when cooking.A very simple, elegant and relativly inexpensive kitchen accessory."
3,Dixieland music,I did not like the Dixieland music format. It is very hard to hear the beat. Its not real bad but I think I can find something better. Maybe tape #2 will be better
4,Very Surprising,"I didn't realize how ""perfect"" David Hyde Pierce was to play a psycho. Very entertaining movie and quite a twist at the end that I was not expecting. This movine was portrayed quite well and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend this as a ""hidden gem"" in my video library. Nice to pick a random movie and it not be terrible. Nice surprise."
4,David Hyde Pierce at his best,"I hadnt even heard of this movie and stumbled upon it via Amazon Prime, was thrown for a loop when i ended up enjoying the entire movie. Even if youre not a big fan of DHP it will grab you with all the twist and turns."
3,To weird !,This movie is just to strange and I found it boring not the kind of movie that you can sit and watch and really enjoy it. If you like off the wall movies that fit in the strange catagory this one is for you.
3,Interesting but highly flawed,It is an interesting plot but highly flawed. Would not recommend it but do not reget watching it. The End.
4,"A Beautiful mind meets, Jeffrey Dhammer","David Hyde Pierce might just be the new Norman Bates. Another superb Indie flick that twists and turns and takes you on a ride.Clayne Crawford, on the run for bank robbery, knocks on a suburban L.A. door and talks his way in. The owner, DHP, invites him to stay for dinner. Crawford soon tries to take control and terrorize DHP but, DHP turns the table and takes Crawford on the terror ride of his life.Who remembers Helen Reddy ? Well she's the nosy neighbor who plays her part so well and tries to get involved.I'm a big fan of Indie flicks as they rely more on the story and the characters as opposed to effects, egos and bank roll. This one delivers. The acting is top notch and DHP delivers a crazed character with a Niles Crane overtone and a Jeffrey Dhammer undertone that has you smiling at his antics when you know you shouldn't be.Great movie which I recommend."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"My husband and I both like this actor (David Pierce) from Frazier, so we thought we'd give this movie a try. It's not what you'd call a scary movie - more like a satire/comedy type, it was somewhat entertaining, and we did somewhat enjoy it."
4,Perfect Host,"This movie was very suspensful, and there was a twisted ending to the movie. Overall, I think David Hyde Pierce did a great job at playing the dark, troubled character. I would love to see him and the ""Sheldon"" character from The Big Bang Theory play Father and son on the show or in a movie together. It is intriguing to watch their odd, quirky on-air personas."
2,Confusing silly movie,I love David Hyde Pierce and can only conclude that he was short of money to have agreed to make this silly pointless film.
4,Wow!,"Who'd a thunk Niles Crane could be so twisted? This was a very good movie, well acted and well written. I enjoyed it completely."
2,An OK movie. Would not pay to see,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to pay to see thins movie. It was interesting, but not very original. It had many ""unexpected twists"" that were very typical of this type of movie."
2,"Too Many Twists, Not Enough Straightaways","David Hyde Pierce stars in this odd, twist-heavy home invasion thriller, in which he suddenly turns the tables on both a desperate assailant and the unsuspecting audience. It's a cinematic contortionist, so desperate to shock and surprise that it gives every single cast member a chance to swivel one hundred-eighty degrees. Unsurprisingly, that trick quickly gets old and we're left to make bold predictions on a shallow, random plot while the puppets perform their jangly, awkward little dance. Pierce is loads of fun as the ludicrously demented straight-lacer with a secret, but the film isn't particularly well-acted and the greater story arc makes almost no sense. It looks terrific for a low-budget production, but desperately needed a few more rounds of screenplay revisions and the caring touch of a proficient editor."
3,Not the best,"I saw this DVD in a store but did not buy it. It was bothering me so I finally got it, but it was not @ all what I thought it was going to be. There are many strange/stupid parts to the movie. It had a good concept, but was not put together with enough seriousness to it @ all."
2,DHP's only dud,"I've been an avid fan of David Hyde Pierce since I first saw him on the TV show, ""Fraiser"" He doesn't have to work at being funny, just a slight change of his expression can make me laugh, he was the star of that sit-com.Then I went to Broadway to see him in the most fantastic Kander & Ebb musical, ""Curtains"". He was phenomenal in that show. I wound up seeing it a total of 17 times, the number would be greater if the show had not closed.That's why I pre-ordered this movie. There is nothing wrong with DHP's acting, he is always great, but the script, or the director, or some thing was terribly wrong. If you like strange, weird movies, you might enjoy it, but if you are looking for comedy, watch some ""Frasier"" re-runs."
1,The Perfect Disappointment,"Pathetic and repulsive, warped and ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody. I do not understand these positive reviews, totally gross and absurd movie."
2,It was sick in more ways than one.,"Besides torture, Pierce was perverted and seeing him dance around that way was sickening to me. It was very very sick."
4,Battle of the minds,"This is a fabulous movie about fateful evening that career criminal spends with a man he never met before. A young man just robs the bank and he is identified by the bank teller. Now that police are on his trail he looks for place to hide until he can safely escape the city and preferrably the country. He ends up getting inside the home of a man who lives alone and is in the process of preparing dinner for his house guests.His host generously offers wine, seat at the table and provides comfort to this stranger who claims to have arrived to LA from his trip to Australia, had his luggage lost and was mugged on the way from the airport. Before long, two men start the game of outplaying each other in attempt to survive the situation they both found themselves in. There are some interesting twists and turns along the way that make this movie not just a psychological thriller but also a very smart movie. Great performances by the two lead actors in this movie."
1,Terrible!,Missing folders on the computer after installing the program. Test page for calibrating the printer doesn't print out. Image library contains images and not solid backgrounds with different colors and shapes. Save your dollars and buy a good kit!
1,shit breaks easily,"dont buy, all the combs broke. if u pack it in a overnight bag, it will def break in half. a mess/ now im lookingto buy an andis comb dryer"
2,Good for awhile,"I loved this dryer to begin with, it works very quickly and smoothed out my curly hair really well. After having it about 6 months now it has begun to overheat almost immediately into the drying cycle. I have literally found charred pieces of my hair in the sink and the bathroom smells like burning hair. I liked it so much I may buy another and give it another chance, but not cool to have to replace it so quickly!"
3,"Great to Straighten Hair, Short Life","I've used this style hair dryer for at least 10 years, and there is something about this type (and this model specifically) of dryer that causes it to die quickly. My biggest issue is that it seems to trip my GFI frequently, and hair builds up inside the dryer (no matter if you try to pull it out each use) and starts to burn and smell. The brush attachment gets frayed after some use, which is to be expected.That said, this is a great tool to quickly dry curly hair and make it straight. I've never been coordinated enough to use a brush and dryer to straighten my hair. This is a brush and dryer in one. Be sure to put some product in your hair and separate it into sections properly to ensure a good blow dry. Even though I have to frequently replace this dryer, I continue to use it for it's ease."
5,fabulous hair dryer,"I am amazed how hard it is to find this hair dryer in stores. With the popularity of straight hair, it is so easy with the brush attachment! I love it so much - I bought tHree!!"
2,"Good dryer, bad brush","I have used these brush attachment hair dryers since the 3rd grade... which was a while ago. This dryer is one of the better dryers I have used with a big BUT. The dryer works great and doesn't short out / over heat like many of the other brands do. HOWEVER, the brush fell off the first time I used it and will not stick back in the grooves. I have it attached by hair bands and it less than ideal."
5,I absolutely love this dryer...,I absolutely love this dryer. Dries hair quickly as it straightens. Use it on my girls hair all the time.
1,Falls apart,I have bought this brand of hairdryer for years but this one is AWFUL. I have to tape it together to keep the brush attachment from falling off.
2,"Dries, but doesn't style...","I was under the impression that I could get style and volume from this device, but it didn't do too much of anything for my hair. I have relatively straight and fine hair, so it dried my hair with no problems, but it didn't look like I had styled my hair at all. I ended up with a weird in between straight and blow out look. If you've got wavy or textured hair, this could help dry and straighten it before you then style it, but for me it just did the same thing my blow dryer does."
4,Great Value,"Really good value for money, although it would be better if it had more than two heat settings. Great for getting knots out of wet hair."
4,Darn good styler at a good price.,"The Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic Styler with 3 Attachments was a replacement styler for the one I broke that belonged to my wife. I'm kind of glad I broke the old one because the new one works great and was inexpensive.I would recommend it."
3,"Great dryer, but it doesn't last","I'm considering buying my third one of these because it's always been easy to use when straightening my semi-curly hair. The frustrating thing, though, is precisely that it will be my THIRD ONE. I think I've had each of the previous ones for less than a year because after a few months it starts to smell like burning hair or plastic when using it, then after a few more months it sporadically fails to work when plugged in. Sometimes the combination of pushing reset buttons on the power outlet and on the plug will do the trick, but at some point it simply refuses to turn on again. I'm not sure if I can bear the hassle again, but I don't see any other dryer with a stiff brush attachment on the market."
4,awesome hairdryer! available in-store at christmas tree shop,i used this hairdryer when i was on vacation with some friends and one of them had it. i don't actually own it YET. but i plan on purchasing one. FYI if you want to buy it at a store instead of online i saw it at Christmas Tree Shop the other day for $23. I'll be getting mine on amazon because I have a gift certificate. Can't wait to have my very own <3
1,TERRIBLE! Brush attachment falls off!,"I had a wonderful previous model for many years that died so I figured I'd go with Conair again. I have shoulder length hair that's wavy and use the brush attachment to straighten my hair. Within a few seconds the brush attachment falls off! I tried taping it on with packing tape and the heat melted that. I have to keep attaching the brush and put it on LOW setting and go very carefully...even then, the brush falls off. It takes me forever to dry my hair now. I see they make another model (ceramic, more expensive) but someone reviewed it and said the brush doesn't fall off. I would say try that one. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one unless you plan to use it with no attachments (in which case a regular blower would do). I am really surprised that a company like Conair would put this on the market with this obvious flaw."
4,dries my long hair quickly,I like it because it dries my hair quickly and has the brush attachment for the ability to style while drying
4,Pretty Good But....,"Okay, so this dryer is absolutely AWESOME. I am an African American woman with pretty thick hair and I am going natural so it's even worse but this dryer with the comb piece is absolutely AMAZING! The reason I say ""but"" is that every time I use it the dryer is so powerful my lights go out and I get so upset because of how straight my hair is getting and I have to switch dryers because I don't want that to keep happening. :( Besides that though I would most definitely recommend trying the dryer I might be the only one with that issue."
5,I Just Love it!,This makes blowdrying my hair so easily! I have tightly coilded hair and I love how easy and fast I can get through my hair with this thing. I think the main reason for it is the shape of this blowdryer. It's only a little longer than the length of all my other wide tooth combs. It's easy to grip and I can blowdry chunks of my hair at one time rather than taking small pieces.
4,CONAIR SD6X,"WORKS GERAT I HAVE HAD NO PREBLEMS WITH THIS DRYER. MY HAIR FEELS GOOD AFTER,. I USE IT. IN THE PAST I HAVE GIVEN ONE TO A FRIEND, SHE LOVES IT TOO."
2,Not What I Hoped For,"I am have researching hair dryer stylers. I purchased this item from Sears and thought it would work. I used the brush attachment which kept falling off. I thought it was defective but I saw no chips in the frame of the attachment. It did not dry well and even after styling it was still frizzy. I used Herbal Essense anti-frizz leave in cream no mousse though. I guess it depends what type of hair you have (ie. thick hair vs. thin hair). I would recommend you buy this styler from a walk-in store so if it doesn't work for you you can return it without having to pay return shipping. I also noticed this styler is available at CVS, Walgreens and Harmons. I have tried other stylers and still have not found the right one for me."
4,Good for thin straight hair,"I have thin straight hair and when I get my hair cut and styled by someone else it looks great, but I have the hardest time styling it myself. I have tried the round brushes and standard hairdryer but I just can't get the hang of it. This hairdryer helps out. My hair never looked so thick (with hair products of course)! The dryer is easy to use and the comb options are nice. If you have problems with the round brushes I would recommend you to try this out."
2,Just O.K if it works,I was glad when I got this hair dryer. It was not great but i thought it did the job just about O.K. The dryer is very loud and it is not easy to handle. But the bigger problem with it was that it stopped working in three days. What more can I say then if it works then good for you...
1,Don't Buy It!!!,"This hairdryer stinks! If you try to use the brush with it the brush finds a way to work its way off the base. Very frustrating! I have long, thick hair and I need the brush to get that smooth finish that I like. Since the brush is always flopping off, all I get is aggravation. Look for another hairdryer, this one will make you furious!"
2,Great styler but accessories awful,I love connair hair dryers and Stylers and have Been using them since i Was a kid. The machine is great as allwAys but the accessory falls down. It is made of bad plastic.
3,Gets the job done.,"I'm neither impressed or dissatisfied with this blow dryer. It does help get my hair straighter faster, but I think the high setting and even the low setting blow my hair around to much to achieve the look I want."
1,brush wont stay on!,I wish o could return this but its too late. I just oepened the box to use it and the brush just keeps popping off. Horrible.
2,Brush does not stay on,"Basic hairdryer.. The brushes always wear down, but I am used to that. I wish you could order just the brushes and not the combs, since I do not even use the combs. I have to always buy a new hair dryer when the brush gets flat.EDIT: the brush does not stay on the handle. I have to duct tape it to the handle in order to use it!"
4,Very fast and easy,I have alot of hair and it is very heavy. It takes forever to dry my hair. It gets really tiring when I have to hold the dryer in one hand the bursh in another.This hair dryer is all in one. You don't need to use a bursh and it is very fast.The cord is too short. But other than that is is one of the best hair dryers I have used.
4,Great for straightening curly hair,The conair hair dryer with brush attachment has been my favorite hairdryer for the last 20 years. It makes it easy to straighten out my hair. It really does the job. The only (slight) problem with this version is that the brush attachment will slip off once in a while.
3,Works well for the price,"It works really well at what it does. I have a lot of fine hair so it can get dried out easily. This hair dryer is pretty good at not frying it out and manages to do it in a manageable time (about 30 minutes, but I have a LOT of hair). Faster drying time would be nicer but I can't say that a hairdryer is a priority enough to spend too much money. I'm happy with it."
2,Could be better,"For my hairstyle, I need a hairdryer with a brush attachment - and they are hard to find. Unfortunately, the brush part falls off some of the time."
3,"Old killer has midlife crisis, makes fool of self over babe","Even hitmen fall in love with women half their age, try to act like young studs, and embarrass themselves. That's the message of DEVIL'S HOLE, Bill Branon's second novel. It, too, is peopled with uninteresting characters, and you may find yourself hoping they die in inventive ways, just to hold your attention. If you like the ""old goat with young doll"" concept, pick up anything written in the '50s by John D. MacDonald. JDM had a lot more insight about men following their crotches than Mr. Branon. Better plots, too"
3,Very disappointing - there are better books on Akitas...,"especially if you want a book that is devoted entirely to the Akita!! Half of this book is about dogs in general. The information is good, just not what I expected from a book entitled ""The Akita: An Owner's Guide..."" The real title of this book is what you find between the parentheses."
3,"Limited ""Akita"" specific information","If you really want specifics and in depth information this book is barely the tip of the iceberg. This reminded me of an infomercial for petfood and veterinarians and retailers.*Training issues and strategies were all but ignored.*Dietary breed specific info was generic at best and IMHO potentially harmful.*The whelping and puppy selection was just repeated info you find in any dog book.I found more info by visiting the websites of Akita clubs. Friends of akitas, for example, is a great online community out of the UK, with in depth treasure of easy to access, online, free breed specific information."
3,"Good, but not Great book on Akitas","As an individual considering the purchase of an akita, I was hoping to find a book that would offer me an indepth look at the breed characteristics, and specific items which would help me better determine if the breed is for me. While the book offers a nice introduction to the Akita breed, it offers no real insight into specifics that could help in my decision. The second half of the book is a generel overview of raising a puppy and training dogs. A great overview, but not what I was expecting."
3,It covers the basics...,"Anyone who has had, or has thought about getting, an akita knows research and education about this breed are absolutely necessary. This ""guide"" is like dipping your toe in the pool vs going for a good swim. I've also noticed a few typos in this book as well. But for $0.01 I can't expect the world, right? With a few exceptions you could insert pretty much any breed type inside, and on the cover of, this book.This is a decent starting point about dogs in general, but if you are seriously looking for accurate, in-depthl information on Akitas invest in Barbara Bouyet's book ""Akita- Tresure of Japan V2"". It's worth the money."
4,Highly underestimated excellent sci-fi series!,"Part 2 of 'the cloudship' series is, like all three of them are, an excellent book. McAllister makes her main character explore the depth of his emotions, his ambitions, his loyalties. She does so in a very, very appealing way that makes this whole series not only something completely different (the idea of mining space gallees in rich resourced nebula's is very original), it also makes this series a very human endeavour."
5,"Junction 18 comes out of nowhere to make great, catchy cd","After I got Junction 18's Vicious Cycle, I listened to it a few times and liked a few songs, but I could never get into it. All of the songs seemed to go together and only a couple really stood out. The vocals were also too quiet and you can't really hear what is being said. All flaws from that cd are corrected with the CD Heroes from the Future. This is one of the best cd's I've heard in a long time. All 6 songs are absolutely awesome, sing-along-catchy. These guys also produce eccentric thought-provoking lyrics. These guys would probably be considered pop-punk, but aren't trying to appeal to mass audiences with their image and stupid teen-angst lyrics. These guys matured an incredible amount from their last cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone. BUY IT."
1,"Very Flawed, Not Recommended At Any Price","This software very flawed - - ran into same problems as other reviewer: Sesame Street did not Load at all, Lego very buggy, no clear exits out of Dr Seuss. Clearly at least 10 year old titles which are not compatible with current XP system. Surprised that this is even put into the market for sale. Simple advice, do not even think about buying."
3,"If they work on your computer, these are pretty fun.","I can sometimes get the Dr. Seuss ABC CD to run on my computer running windows XP, but the others seem to stall. All these cd's were released in the mid 90's, so I imagine they were made for Windows 95.That said, my 15 month old son LOVES to sit on my lap and watch the ABC's, and he enjoys the others, particulaly the Pooh one, but I can't always get them to go without a great deal of delay and frustration.If you have an old computer sitting in the garage, dig it out and put these on it and set it up in your kids room. That's what I'm going to do this weekend!"
1,What an over rated piece of software,"This is one of the worst pieces of software I have purchased so far for my preschoolers. The Sesame Street CD has 20 pages! of credits that you MUST watch just to exit the program. Believe me, I tried every exit button I could think of to bypass them. What is with that? Just exit the program already. It is worse than a video, at least you can turn that off. The Dr Seuss CD has only 1 'game' and it is just the Dr Seuss Alphabet book on the computer screen. Nothing new there for my kids and I would never call it a game. Granted, I have only gone through these two so far, but if they are any indication, I will be taking this sucker back tomorrow."
1,Wake me up!,"As a daily rider of the New York subway system, I find it dynamic and exciting piece of living history. This book, however, was not. It is a plodding academic treatment that focuses more on politics than the actual system. The pictures were too few. The maps were poorly realized and uninformative. As the system is still in place largely as it was decades ago, I would have liked references to the current line and station names instead of trying to guess or sit there with my own maps (something you can't do if reading while riding the subway). The subway system represents both a technological marvel and an instrument of great social change. Where is that book."
4,Subway interesting for those interested,"Long on politics and organization but short on actual construction history. I would have preferred more detail about the techniques and trouble sncountered along the way. After all, most of the construction took place a very long time ago technology wise."
4,fair,"this book mainly about how the transportation system evolved and stuff in NYC. Very informative...mostly a research of the past and such to now...like a research paper mostly book form.however, delivery from amazon is horrible....took like 2 weeks to get here? so i was behind in reading for school."
3,It leaves me wondering about his research,"Hood says that the Dakota Apartment building was so named because of its remote location. Not so. However, we references The New York Herald Tribune, August 1, 1880.I looked and looked but couldnt find the reference.....if it is there, terrific - I would be ecstatic!I was left wondering why the stations were built where they were: Why was there a 14/18/23/28/33 on the East Side (but nothing until 42...? Wht Spring and not Prince (on the IRT)"
2,Not as great as it sounds!,"Purchased for trip to Disneyland, but was disappointed with the difficulty in turning and navigating. We returned it and purchased another instead."
5,love at first sight,"I love these shoes! i had wanted them for quite some time when i found them on amazon for around 50% off, which was great! and they are super comfortable, some of the most comfortable shoes i own."
4,Nikon Buckmaster,I like it. Only used it once at the range so far but zeroed in easily. Great scope for the price.
5,Great Price - Bright Field of View,"I recently purchased this product for my new Weatherby Vanguard 30-06. I am a long-time open sight shooter - calibers 22 through 30-06. As an 'old man', I am a newbie when it comes to hunting with a scope. Needless to say, I did a lot of investigating. I eventually decided on a Nikon scope with a BDC reticle.A note on scope brightness: The greater the transmitted light, the brighter the scope (and the greater the expense!). The Nikon 3-9x40 Buckmaster transmits 92% of gathered light compared to 90% of other models. The Amazon price point on this bright scope made the increased cost negligible (within $10 of similar Nikon scopes).I have range-tested this scope an sighted it in at 100 yards with my Weatherby. What a bright scope! I shot 4-5 round groups all between 1-1.5"" MOA and could see the target impacts as well as the spotter."
3,Great workout - a little dry.,"This is not so much a bellydancing workout than a workout isolating different areas of the body. Which is why I like it. The workouts in this video strengthen areas of the body you use when you bellydance - making this the perfect video between classes if you take them. I do one or two everyday in addition to cardio.My only complaint is that I think Rania is a little awkward. My boyfriend I can't help laughing while I have it on. She's a little on the dry side - especially because of the narration rather than her actually talking. But other than that, this is a great training video."
1,Not much fun,"If you are looking for a ""fun"" dance workout, look somewhere else. I wanted a good workout incorporating dance movement but was sadly disappointed with this dvd."
5,belly dance work out,brilliant short workouts for the person that has little timw to fit in a full work out and especially good if you have a knowledge of the belly dance techniques
5,I love these drills,"The reviews are true: there's no bellydance in this video. The music is more like smooth jazz than bellydance. But for me, these strength-building drills are no-nonsense, to the point and short with enough variation to keep me interested and focused. Because the drills are based on dance moves, they're reasonably fun to do (though it's nothing like real dancing). I do at least one of these routines almost every day, and three of the five are simple enough for me to do before my first coffee. It wakes me up enough for me to do a more complicated workout or move on to another section of this video. For the current price (less than five bucks), this video definitely has been worth it.If I could make only one suggestion for Rania (or any other video exercise instructor), please wear something other than all black. I want to be able to see what your legs are doing, and it's hard if you're wearing all black!"
4,Belly Dancing Video,This is a great video for those of us who dont have time for a full work out everyday. There are five - 10 minute segments (one for each day of the week). It is a very good intense workout. The instructor is easy to follow.
2,too mcuh workout,This is too much of a generic aerobic workout video. Has very little belly dancing content actually. Doesn't talk about technique. It is a mild belly dancing workout for epople who want general aerobic workout. Not for people who are serious about belly dancing.
5,It was the best teenage book I've ever read.,This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.I've also read a lot of the springsong books they are all wonderful
3,Not for Volunteer Operated Non-Profits,"My sense is that this book is aimed at larger and more well funded non-profits than I have experienced. There are many references to ""have the staff do it"". The non profits that I have experienced and tried to help organize have had at most one staff person. Thus much of the advice is aimed at a different organization than these. For larger organizations (budget over $50,000) this book offers some helpful advice. I found the section on organizing meetings (or conventions) as being particularly helpful."
3,Reasonably good overview of business disciplines,"This was a text for a graduate class in non-profit management. It was far better than the other text, and some chapters were very helpful. It would be better served as a reference book for an executive library than to read cover to cover."
4,Amulet of Quilla,"While the series is good it screams for more development near the end of each book. The author spends half of the book setting up the story, the next third on some plot, and then just wraps the book up like a half hour tv program that needs to be finished immediately. I was very disappointed to find several that the editor did not catch. The character Jonathan starts out 24 years old in the first two books, but in the third book he is 22. While my school children have enjoyed the books, they were disappointed in the lack of consistancy within the books."
4,A solid introduction,"A great introduction to bonds and there place in a portfolio. The perfect place for the individual to start if they are considering purchasing individual bonds for their portfolio.However, anyone looking for more in-depth information and strategies will likely be disappointed. Relatively little information about Zeros, TIPS and other products that are likely to be of interest. Start here, and then increase your knowledge with a title specific to your interests (i.e. municipal bonds, etc.)."
2,Too Complicated,Thau over complicates her points. The book is too difficult to understand. I am an attorney who has been investing in stocks and bonds for over 10 years. This book is not appropriate for any level investor.
5,My Favorite Christmas CD Ever,"This is a CD that never gets tired. Selah has created such a beautiful, soothing, yet stirring set of songs in ""Rose of Bethlehem"", it has no equal."
5,Pure Sweetness,"Again, Selah are fantastic at what they do. They love God and each other and love to sing and worship and that makes all of their albums that much better!"
4,"Aaaah, Selah.","The voices of Selah are soothing enough to put you to sleep, yet you don't want to miss a thing, so you don't! This isn't going to be one of my favorite Christmas cd's because I like the classics, but I definitely will bring it out each year!"
2,Somewhat disappointed,"Over the years I've grown tired of the overly-produced, Nashville-driven sound that marks most Christian music. Lacking in subtlety, driven by formula, generally generic - that's the plan for so many albums and artists who make up the CCM scene. And this album fits that scene perfectly. Yes, their vocals are powerful; yes, their harmonies are tight; yes, their tunes are catchy. But there's nothing original here, nothing unexpected, and to that end, nothing truly human. The album has a great veneer, but it lacks any soul. And for Christmas, above all times, I'm looking for something with more human spirit."
4,Nice Rug,"I ordered this runner, but found it was too short and the wrong color for my home and sent it back--but that did not prevent me from realizing the beauty of this rug. Momnei does a wonderous job with their rugs. The Harmony collection is especially nice. I later found a Momeni Harmony runner in another color and pattern, along with a matching 7' 9"" round, that fit perfectly in my home. The detailing is nice. The hand cutting around the flowers gives it a lovely effect. The fibers are nice, soft to walk on barefoot."
3,On Wings of Eagles,"Great true story of Ross Perot's plan and execution of the freeing of his employees of IDS who were taken hostage while working in Iran. The book, written by Ken Follett, was excellent. The movie version lacks some of the book's excitement and color, possibly due to the casting of the characters. Perhaps, it was the direction which was lacking in insight and depth. Still, all in all, a great portrayal of an important event in America's history. A truly heroic and patriotic film."
2,UnAble to watch,This DVD is a EU version. I will not be like others and resell it. I will keep it for now.
5,A must watch!,Our family absolutely loves this movie! What an incredible reminder of Christ love and sacrifice for us!! We have owned this movie for over 15+ years and watch it almost every Valentine's day. We like to invite over neighborhood children and have a little Valentine party while watching it.
5,The truth at last...,"If you only read the first 40 pages of this book, you will get the point.The solution to our ""health crisis"" is so simple that we are missing it completely. It is NOT better drugs, more testing, more doctors, higher insurance premiums, etc.The solution is taking personal responsibility for eating low on the food chain, and looking for business opportunities which enhance health rather than degrade it.We've been living that lifestyle since 1972, and it works. We are in our mid-50's and healthy, trim, fit, and we love every day because we know that we may reach out to touch the lives and health of people in the spirit and practice of prevention and wellness.Great job, Paul Pilzer, in telling the truth about the economics of sick care vs. Health Care!"
4,The Wellness Revolution: How to make a fortune in the next trillion dollar industry,"Great book, great information, excellent and informative reading for anyone already in or contemplating starting up in the Health Industry"
5,Wellness is worth it!,Paul educates the reader about how to take part in the next trillion dollar industry by getting into health and wellness.
2,What a waste of time.,"Nothing different to report that the other two-star ratings didn't cover. The book had two plots to follow with their own subplots within each. I'm not sure they even wrapped them up properly. The story itself was long and unnecessarily drawn out. I felt like I had wasted a few days of my life reading this but couldn't just give up the fight. Thought it would get better. Unfortunately, it never did."
2,A Pale Shophomore Attempt,"Well I thought Dark To Mortal Eyes was bad, whew! This one took the Crap Award for worst novel. It tell you it was sheer pity that I read this book by Americas fore runner in shoddy writing. If I had a window to prop up, Expiration Date would be the book I reach for. Clay Ryker is a self loathing drunk with a nack for trouble. After a strange encounter with a mysterious woman, he gains the ability to sense peoples ""expiration dates"", much like this novel, I was just waiting for it to expire.This is Eric Wilson's failed stab at giving it another shot. I gave him two stars this time for the gall to keep going, but I have to say, ""Give it up man, hug a tree or something. Writing is not your gig.""On a more serious note, I would like to say to all the writers out there: read this book, and learn what not to do.You know I love you."
5,entertaining and thought provoking,"Expiration Date tackles the question of how much free-will a person has versus how much the steps in his life are already in place by God, overriding free-will. This is undoubtedly a question that causes debate among people, but a question that is worth serious consideration. Eric Wilson has woven both sides into this book with a captivating, fast-paced story.From the spiritual influences to the personal choices that have been made by those in the town he grew up in, Clay Ryker struggles to get his life on solid footing while dealing with an unwanted, surprise ""gift"" that was passed onto him on his way home. Expiration Date cleverly shows the struggle to find the answer to the question of free-will through the frustrations, mystery, and intrigue that Clay Ryker must sort through. While it is an entertaining story and a suspenseful thriller, it is also a thought provoking topic."
3,Balanced more in one direction than the other,"Isabel Kershner is currently a NYTimes Correspondent in Israel. She has covered Israeli-Palestinian issues for some time and is an experienced hand. In considering the question of the defensive barrier built and being built by Israel to prevent terrorist attacks on its population she speaks to all parties involved. She speaks to Palestinian Arab villagers whose lives are made more difficult by the barrier, and to Israeli settlers who also oppose it as dividing the land they wish to see unified. She speaks with Israeli defense people who defend the Barrier , and human rights demonstrators who rally against it. She appears to be in one sense objective but her tilt is more to the Palestinian side.There is a feeling that she does not underline strongly enough the Palestinian rejection of the very right of existence for Israel."
4,A good book teaching you OO with UML in two days,"After reading several books written by three Amigos, I find this book do the good job of teaching you how to develop OO systems using UML.It distills the goodies of the OO Process chapter by chapter. Finally, two cases are used to illustrate the concepts and techniques presented.Take this book if you want to equip yourself with OO technology."
5,The formula works!!!,What is branding? How do people really remember you? How do you build your brand? This book gets back to the basics. There really is a magical formula. For you. For your company.I bought this book because it was different. It disagreed with everything I had previously learned. This book can change the way you think. Forever. My mind turns in a completely new direction. Seeing things from a complete new angle. How can anybody pass up such an opportunity?
1,I HAVENT WASTED MONEY LIKE THIS SINCE BIG MOUTH BILLY BASS!!,"I have read more intelligent things on the bathroom wall at the local convenience store!What a waste of trees!All this book is is a bunch of blabbering about nothing!Do yourself a favor and read a Dr Suess book, it will make more sense and be more practical!The author either had friends give the 5 star reviews, paid people for them, or they were given by grade school children!"
5,Secret Formulas of the Wizard of Ads,"After hearing Mr. Williams speak I felt I needed to get a better insight to the author. To be honest, I went looking for an epiphany, what I discovered was I had already had one by hearing him speak and reading his words only confirmed my discovery.To quote, ""don't looking outside the box, get a new box."""
1,"The Secret? ""I've got your money!""","Roy is charismatic and dynamic, but his ideas are nothing more than recycled tripe. If you find John Edward ""compelling"" and Sylvia Brown ""deeply spiritual"" then Roy Williams is the Philosopher for you!With no formal education (nor much informal, for that matter), Roy uses glib phrases that promise great and secret research and that will dispense with the need for all that boring...you know, WORK. You can just listen to Roy. Let the words flow over you. Give him your credit card and be at one with All Things -- well, All Stupid Things, at least."
2,"More ego, More hype, A little more substance this time....","During our last visit with the self proclaimed ""Wizard"" we were given fluff oh plenty. It is nice that even wizards can listen to an outcry begging for substance. Round two seems to answer that call with some good tidbits. The problem remains, as with the first, the author. ""The Wizard"" remains a self proclaimed messiah that hopes to enlighten us. Maybee book three will include relying less on ego and more on real world solutions."
2,"Lots of fluff, little info","I found this book lacking. On almost every page I found myself wondering, ""Where's the great info I was expecting?"" It seems I read an outline of what, when finished, would be a good book.The packaging of the book was eye catching ... the information, unfortunately, was woefully incomplete. I have read that others found this book ""inspiring."" This leads me to wonder how dull their ad skills were to begin with.Great package ... little substance."
2,Michael Jackson: Triple Feature,"Did not like it at all, I was thinking that it was something new, also there was no image available for you to see the item. I will tell you what the Dvds are. 1. Michael Jackson History The King Of Pop 1958-2009.2. Michael Jackson life Of A Superstar. 3. What Killed The King Of Pop. I have all of these Dvds already, so do not waste your money on this. I will be sending this back to Amazon.Pat Minton( Louisville, Ky. )"
3,OK,I thought that each documentary was going to be unique but there were many repetitive scenes and interviews . Still a great DVD for MJ fans
4,Michael Jackson Triple Feature,This was an overall good documentary.It was a lot of what I've already heard and seen but there were different views on the story which was nice to see.
5,ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC!!,THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST AUTHENTIC BLUEGRASS CD I'VE EVER HEARD.THE SONG SELECTION IS GREAT AND THE INSTRUMENTAL WORK IS UNBELIEVABLE. EVERY MUSICIAN ON THIS CD IS TOP-NOTCH. I WISH I COULD GET 10 MORE CDS JUST LIKE IT.
2,Too dull and hard to use,I had high hopes for these nail scissors and am very disappointed. My nails are not thick at all but the cut is crude; it's hard to guide the scissors into the corners of the nails as well. I do not recommend this product.
2,Limited at best,I am a moderatly experienced woodworker and I found this video fairly interesting but limited even for the begining woodworker. It leaves out many important steps in woodworking. This tape should be a freebe for people who buy a Shop Smith. It seems geared more toward demonstrating the Shop Smith than a teaching tool. I do not recommend this tape if you are experienced enough to know the difference between a rip cut and a cross cut!
1,Worthless,"This camera wouldn't take a charge, and Kodak didn't stand behind it. I won't buy from Kodak again."
1,Flash bad 2 weeks after warranty was up.,"Flash bad 2 weeks after warranty was up. The camera worked fine, except for battery usage. I'M REALLY TICKED OFF ABOUT THE FLASH. I PAID JUST UNDER $300. FOR THE CAMERA. I ALWAYS TOOK THE BATTERIES OUT WHEN I WASN'T USING THE CAMERA....I WON'T BUY ANOTHER kodak."
5,Best affordable digital camera with 3MP that one can buy,"I was searching a digital camera .... I review all of them ranging between 2 upto 3 megapixel. I found this digital camera offering all requirement that a professional camera could have. Also, it is best in the market for this ratio of quality/price. therfore I rated 5 stars."
4,Good Camera - software?,"Just had it a few days, great camera ... many useful features.High quality photos, can shoot in many kinds of lighting. Easy to use. The software is easy and does everything for you, but has no easy way to opt out of its default file locations. The photo editting software is pretty basic. Other software such as GIMP for windows is available free that will do much more comprehensive editting."
4,great traveling companion,"I purchased the ""Baggallini Ticket Organizer"" to handle my passport, boarding passes, ID and cash for a recent trip. It was the perfect traveling companion for holding everything I needed close at hand. Since I have returned home, I am continuing to use it - just popped it into my purse so that when I need to just grap some cash, ID and debit card its all there. It frees up my hands at the market for example and means I don't have to worry about my purse in the grocery cart or juggling my purse when I want to be unencumbered. I've also had a lot of compliments from my friends - I think this will make a great gift for them too!"
4,Good and bad,"This organizer was good in theory. I like that it has a pocket for your boarding pass and tickets, and another pocket for your passport. When I took it on its first trip overseas, I found that the clear plastic window was ""sticky"" and didn't let my tickets slide in and out easily. This is exactly what you want when you're on the go. Also, the ID holder was a bit annoying because it was in the passport pocket and I really wanted to have all the space.I didn't want to go through the trouble of returning it, so I just took a pair of scissors and went to town on it. I cut out the plastic and then I chopped off the ID tag and stuck it in the zippered compartment. I'll post again when I take another trip with my Baggallini."
4,good product,"it looks a little roomier in photo than it is is, but is a great product that I would recommend to anyone."
2,Good for preparation of a written sales presentation.,"This book is good is helping the reader to prepare written sales proposals. Instead of snowing your prospects with every conceivable feature of your product or service, you can follow the format given in the book to produce a short, one-page presentation that adequately covers the major aspects of whatever you're selling plus how the product or service will provide benefits to effectively address the prospect's needs. If, however, your selling job does not involve making written or oral presentations, I find this book to be of little value."
4,This book contains a lot of valuable information.,"This book contains a lot of pragmatic and valuable information on how to persuade others, incl. your own management, to buy your ideas. The structure facilate the understanding of so common but also complexe processes like buying and persuasion. For sure, recommanded reading."
1,Log Splitter,The log splitter was a very great compliment to the Truck. My grandson was very inpressed with the 'workings' of it all.
3,farm toy,"good detail toy, limited in its play time but the kids enjoyeddidnt have the truck to attached it too.but still a good stand alone toy"
3,nice. affordable performance collection,"This is a nice collection of performances at a reasonable price. It is true- if you have all 3 Twins ""discover"" DVDs, their Slim Down and Rania's 4 weight loss DVDs, you will have all these performances. Of course, if you have them on vhs, you will be missing most of them, except for a few of Rania's.Given how expensive many bellydance performance dics are, this is a decent buy. The dancers are all very good and show several different styles. Sohaila has a few lovely classical Egyptian numbers, and Louchia has 2 Persian numbers- a style often left off of performance compilations. Marina has several wonderful Turkish, cabaret numbers, including a really strong drum solo. And finally, Rania has several strong performances, including her famous ""Wings of Isis"" dance, a sword dance and a really nice improv piece. I would liked to have seen a few more dancers, but overall, this is well produced, with a nice variety of styles, tempos and music."
3,Good....B-,"This performance video was ok. Some of the performances were boring and no creative. The faces of some of the dancers were scary sometime (Rania and Marina). I am not a professional dancer, but I was looking for something difficult to learn. So I bought this video because I was looking for ideas to make a coreography piece, but I was upset after I watched the whole thing. By the way, the costumes were nice. I would suggest to buy another video instead!!!!"
3,It's okay...,"This DVD is okay. I personally don't think it's too spectacular. They use the same dull set for every performance. Frankly to be honest, I think the only dancer really worth seeing is Rania. Sohaila puts on a pretty good performance as well, but the other two dancers just don't appeal to me at all. That's probably why they don't perform as often as Sohaila or Rania."
1,I cant believe you put something out like this.,"This video is a waiste of money. Rania performace ,although technically ok. she definately needs to work on stage presence. I didnt like her blank stare, it just annoyed me. Marina performaces were horrible. She was just flying thru her dance without listening to the music; therefore, being behind with the beat of the music. Not to mention her costumes didnt flatter her figure at all. Louchia dancing was great, although I have not ever seen in persian dance that the middriff (belly) was exposed. They state she is wearing an authentic persian costume but to my knowledge it is not. Souhaila's performances were good and to the most part very egyptian and her costumes were fabulous. She lacks energy. I got bored with her cuz she was so robotic."
1,"if you are looking forward to learn something, this DVD is not for you","Please, if you want to learn bellydance, spend you money in another DVD.I watched it expecting to learn something new, but I only saw dancers I have seen before with other videos I have.It is fun to watch and if you already master bellydance, you can get some ideas to your performances.Definetly do not spend your money in this dvd if you are looking for teaching. This product would be not for you."
4,Its an excellent book for young adults,Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones is about two young teenagers that are an item . July is a 16 year old girl who has plans to go to college. Bo Jo is 17 and is going to college by his football scholarship. One night they go to the beach and at first they start talking about school. Then they start making out and one thing leads to another. A couple of days go by and no call from Bo Jo. He calls the next day and acts like nothing happened. By the end of the month they go to a party and he is pressuring her to do it again. But she doesn't know if she wants to do it again so she says let me think about it for at least five minutes. The rest is for you to find out if you read this good book about two kids playing house.~~** Hi Mrs. Barreira **~~
3,It was a interesting and some what realistic to the 90's.,"I found that this book was pretty good. It had a slow start in the beginning, but it came along in the end. It's all about this teenage girl who gets pregnant and decides to keep the baby. Her and her boyfriend then decide to get their own apartment and take on an adult life. Once you start reading it gets hard to put the book down. Her parents then decide to give her husband (they got married) a job at the bank. I guess you could say that her parents aren't exactly realistic parents. To know the rest, then you'll have to read this book. ENJOY!"
5,:0) You won't want to put this down (o:,"Mr. And Mrs. Bo Jo Jones was a story about a teenage couple who gets in "" trouble "" . They are forced into married .The story shows all the ups and downs of their teenage marriage , the changes in their life styles and what their friends and relatives think . The story takes an unexpected turn , and left me in tears. I reccomend this book to everyone . It was definately one of the best books I have ever read!!"
5,one of my all time favorite books,This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite books. I read it in high school and could never seem to forget about it. Then here comes Amazon and they have it! I have already bought a paperback version of this book and today I have bought a book with school binding which usually is one of the best kind to get. I am 5o years old now and no longer that teenager from my youth but this is one book that I love reading over and over. I picture myself reading this again and again in the future.
4,Great Read,"This book gives a truthful look into teen pregnancy.It gives you a wonderful feel for the characters, and even gives you glimpses at the life they would have had if that night hadn't happened.I would definitly suggest this book to anyone who would care to read it,and be prepared for an amazing and tragic story."
4,Beautifully written,"An interesting tale of teenage love. Or at least what they believe was love.My High School was throwing away its collection of this book (7 years ago), and I grabbed a copy for free.It turned out to be one of the best free books I have ever read. I will certainly make my kids read it when they reach their teens."
1,Not worth the cost,"Those who were mesmerized by Dark of the Gods and Seeker's Mask may be disappointed by this long-awaited 3rd volume from Hodgell. While 2 of the stories do shed light on the history behind Jame, her brother and the world her people are now in, much of this very slender volume is repetitive (the Ishtier / scroll theft story is here in full its first incarnation) or mediocre at best.At [$] way overpriced ... at [$]it still is. This reads like an attempt to wring additional money from fans. Save your money and your time."
4,Blood and Ivory,"Great short stories, there are a few that fill in the saga of the Knorth clan, and all are richly written with a darkness hovering throughout the tales. It is NOT a continuation of Jame's saga, but more of her past is revealed...however, there is one short story that touches on her possible future.Still, I loved the book, and it was well written and so very creative in P.C. Hodgell's usual way."
5,Excellent value,An attractively produced easy to follow introduction to olive oils around the world.
3,187 - not what you think,"don't judge this movie by it's cover... i bought it cuase of the title and a lil for the story. it sounded good, and the title, well, pretty much anything w/ 187 in it, usually implies a gangsta movie, right?not so in this case... i mean, it's gangster, but it centers around one thug named Shadow, who's confused. He's in charge of a gang, and is kinda going soft. He meets an old man who wants to train him as a 'boxer' so he says... Shadow goes to learn 'boxing', but he's not really learning how to box, he's learning how to be a man and let go of the gang life... and get a good life.Of course, as he's trying to get out and go straight, his gang life interferes w/ that.. accidents happen, ppl lose their lives, closes ones of shadow and some of the gangstaz too...it's one of those type movies.... it's good entertainment... good for a watch... take my advice, and rent it... or buy it cheap."
1,Worst movie ever!!!,"I enjoy corny Hispanic gangster movies because it reminds me of the people I grew up with. Blood In, Blood Out- overdramatic and laughable! American Me- sad, but the ""you've never been with a woman before scene"" will always be a joke among my friends. 187 Shadow Lane- so bad I couldn't finish watching it. I didn't even want to laugh at how bad it was. Bad, bad, bad."
3,Not Her Best,"I am a Martha Stewart zealot. That's why it pains me to give this a less-than-stellar ""3"" rating.Here are a few notes:- The recipes, while yummy favorites (e.g. macaroni and cheese, egg salad) are quite complicated. (By this I mean that many of the recipies require ingredients you wouldn't readily find in your pantry or take quite long to prepare/bake/cook.) I would suggest buying this book if you have a few extra lbs. of Brie and in your refrigerator and a Sunday afternoon to kill.- The artwork, as always, is stunning. (For those of you who read ""Martha Stewart Living"" magazines, the look/feel is very similar.)- There are fewer recipies than one might expect. This is a very thin volume. If you want more bang for your Martha buck, I might suggest buying one of her compilation cookbooks.In my mind, anything by Martha is high quality. In the end, though, I wish I spent my pennies on another one of her products."
1,Found No Comfort,"What a major disappointment. I have several of Martha's earlier cookbooks, which are creative, delightful and offer really wonderful tasting food. For example, when I cook something from her Quick Cook Menus people love it. Unfortunately Favorite Comfort Food is not a book that will stay on my shelf! Besides the poor content, the quality of the book is more like [an inexpensive] magazine. Martha Stewart Living magazine in fact would probably hold up with use better than this book."
4,Title States EXACTLY what you get!,"First of all....i have never made a Martha Stewart Recipe that does not have a thousand ingredients! (other than the Everyday Food Magazine which I LOVE!), so....as some of the reviewers have stated yes there are many ingredients, BUT the end results are well worth the time and effort it takes to go get quality ingredients to make more than excellent food! The macoroni and cheese! (if made the way the direction call and ingredients stated can not be anything but delicious!) AND we use the pancake and waffle recipes constantly! My 4 year old who said yesterday i don't like waffles (because we've been having pancakes)ate them all day long!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything i have tried from this book has been VERY well eaten! I would recommend this over any of the other Martha Stewart Cookbooks i have! And yes it is small, but....packed with great comfort food as stated!"
2,Nothing I'd Use,"So there isn't much in this book I got any use of. The pictures were nice, but as a seasoned cook, who knows the basics of cooking, I didn't come away with inspiration for anything new with this book. Big Martha fan here, but not for this book."
3,I was disappointed.,"This is a thin book with a limited number of recipes. No doubt each recipe leads to a tasty product, but my overall reaction was ""there's nothing really new here."" In the meat categories -- beef, chicken, lamb, pork -- there are only two or three recipes at most for each critter. Personally, I could not recommend this particular cookbook to anyone."
3,Comfort foods,I'm a Martha fan but recipes have changed today. There are detailed instructions for making these recipes although some I wouldn't consider for everyday.
2,I have yet to like a recipe.,Although there are a lot of comfort food recipes in the book none of the ones I've tried have worked out well.
2,Big rock n' roll!!!,"Rock and roll is appealing to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba! I enjoy this album. Great tunes, Big PoombaI would reckon-mend this to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba, BP already listened and has no money.But anyone else who likes the rock and The Rock, I would definitely reckon-mend this to you. They are better than the Strokes and the White Stripes."
2,High level overview,"This book hardly provides any more information than Unigraphic's built in help menu. This book contains ""projects"" that lead the user through different exercises, however the instructions for the projects are often vague and not clear. I often had to refer back to the built in help menu to complete the exercises.The sixth project in chapter 6 ""Form Features"" does not adequately explain how to create a guide string to sweep your string sketch along. I had to refer to the help menu to figure this part out.I would not recommend this book to others."
5,"This Polynesian book links ancient Europeans, Asians and aborigines Africans","""POLYNESIAN INTERCONNECTIONS"" celebrates the unity of one Polynesian family related to Europeans, Asians and Aborigines Africans through their ancient heritage and genetics. The term Polynesian means 'many islands' or 'many races.' The Polynesians came from an ancient family of intermixed races and today we share our 'ohana' with all peoples of the world. We are one family, the human family, the Polynesian family. To the world we say 'ALOHA' and may the love and spirit of family bring happiness and prosperity into our lives."
5,A masterpiece!,Jacques Ellul is a master of prose and of theology. He beautifully weaves together themes from across the canon to produce a set of insights that kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
1,obtuse and pedantic,For a Christmas gift for my husband who has multi-degrees and cannot make heads/tails out of the author's purposefully obtuse academia...
2,missing a piece,"sure, it's used, but one page is missing a piece & it doesn't pop up. worn-looking. this was a gift, so i should have bought it new."
5,Pop-up is Tops,Now I know why I love California so much - this pop-up book tells it all! Well worth the money.
2,DO NOT BUY-NO PYREX GLASS!!!,"I can not rate the actual Wilton metal baker because I haven't used it yet but you may want to pick another item to purchase. The Pyrex glass insert does not come included in the box. I received my first one with no Pyrex insert, returned it and waited for the replacement just to receive another Wilton baker with no glass insert! It has been a hassle and Amazon said this is a widespread problem. It still hasn't been resolved and it's been a month!! I don't see why the glass insert can't just be shipped out alone!"
2,...missing the Pyrex dish,"I'm really glad that it occurred to the customer from Delaware to warn other people that the Pyrex dish is missing, because it is really frustrating and disappointing, and I'd hate to see it continue to happen to other folks. My experience was pretty much identical to theirs, and they are right - it's no good to bake in without the glass dish (and that's a lot of money for something that looks good but you can't use!) After the second shipment arrived with no dish, I went out and got my own because I really like the metal baker and was determined to make it work. I've contacted Amazon.com several times to let them know the problem, but it's been nearly two months and no resolution. They only offer to take it as a return, but as I keep telling them, I don't want to return it, and especially not now that I've gone out and gotten the Pyrex dish! Mostly I just don't want to see it continue to happen to other people, so do be warned. Thanks, Delaware, for the heads-up."
1,Wilton Armetale does not ship with glass insert,"My wife ordered the Rectangular Baker just after Christmas, and it arrived without the glass insert (I wish we would have read the two other reviews). I re-read the product description and it states it does not ship with the glass insert. Nonetheless, I called Wilton Armetale to find out their side of the story. The customer service agent said that Wilton stopped shipping the baker with the glass insert around January of 2004. The agent suggested I take up my grievance with Amazon.com!"
5,No worries: it's the real deal,"I bought this as a gift. I had some trepidation because of the disclaimer ""Packaging for this product may vary from that shown in the image"" and a 2008 review about the item arriving sans box. Not to worry: I was shipped the genuine article inside the packaging (black box) shown, cello-sealed, with lot # etc.Of course, my gf LOVES this fragrance."
5,Inspirational book for aspirant alpinists,The book is an inspiration to anyone contemplating visiting the Mont Blanc Massif to climb. Route descriptions for 100 routes with inspirational colour photos of each route. My only regret is that my skill is not up to climbing most of the routes - but one can always dream.
3,Nice Overview But Not A Guide,"For those who know NOTHING about Mont Blanc, it is a nice start. This book was a nice introduction to Mont Blanc, but it was not sufficiently detailed to do any serious planning for a climb to the summit. There are plenty of routes, but no detailed maps, like perhaps a 1:50,000, or 1:100,000 scale. Also, there was no detailed explaination of the hut system and how to actually make reservations, etc. In addition, there were no phone numbers or addresses for more detailed information. Furthermore, there was no discussion of where to park cars, or get off of trains to start via the cable cars. Also, there were no climatology graphs for temperature or precipitation on Mont Blanc. There were not even recommendations for more detailed guide books. In my opinion, Mount Whitney, California has exponentially better information with a computer message board, maps, and very detailed guide books."
1,Ignorant Solution,"This lady must have been paid by the drug companies. Don't buy this book if you want to beat your self-defeating habit. Wendy is irresponsible, basically saying the solution is medication. NO. DON'T. There are other ways beyond medication. That will not cure it!!!! People with an addiction actually ave a hidden gift once figured out how to cure it, this book just opts to smother it.WENDY QUITE WRITING BOOKS FOR THE SAKE OF AMERICA."
3,For me the information wasn't much I hadn't heard before,"Depends, I suppose on what people have read. I have read a great deal about ADD and some about the connection to addictive tendencies - the information here seemed pretty self-evident. But if you are new to the topic, it may be great. Another good one if someone is interested in a more sophisitcated ""take"" on the subject - would be Mate's ""In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts"""
3,No color images,Buyer be warned that the images in this book are taken right out of period catalogs and these do not contain color images.
4,Fashion and Fun,"This is a great book if you're looking for an overview of fashions from 1909 to 1930, concentrating on clothes available from Sears catalogs of the period. The book includes women's, men's, children's, and infant's clothing. The text is entertaining to read. I was a little disappointed that there were not more examples of fashion in the 20's. Nevertheless, it is an informative and fun book to refer to if you have an interest in period fashion"
4,"Great boots, undersized",These are great boots but the 5.5 was really only about a 5.0 and where a bit tight. We had to send them back.
2,Count Dracula - Jack Palance,"I didn't care for ""Count Dracula."" Too slow and didn't show any blood, or actual bitting from the count.I can't speak for the other film, for I have not viewed it as yet. I can only hope it is a bit faster, scarier than the first film."
3,Jack Palance into Horror Palace,"Jack Palance make two brilliant performances in this two tv movies. In the first, the teleplay of Richard Matheson conects Bram Stoker's charachter with a lost love before Coppola's movie. The second is a very reliable version of Stevenson's classic. Filmed in videotape, the look is, perhaps, a little ugly, but it's very interesting by the vision of the two classics and the great casting (not only Palance)."
3,Fine product.,"Looks great. It is made reasonably well. The only issue is that it is too heavy for a kid 4-6 years old. I don't understand how could they design and sell so heavy products for kids. It is hard to find light, $100, basic bike for 4-6 kid. Overall I recommend the product."
2,Buy FitMama instead - it includes this entire video,"I can't believe I fell for buying this tape. I bought FitMama and it said it included FitMama and Me. When I watched the FitMama and Me portion it was so short, I figured it couldn't be the whole video - just a preview. Well, when this video showed up and it was 18 minutes long I knew I was wrong. The FitMama actually included the whole FitMama and Me workout. Buyers should note this is a very short video with very short segments: Dance with me - 4 min (dancing with your baby) Tummy Time - 3 min (crunches with your baby) FitBaby - 3 minutes (workout for your baby) Quiet Time - 3 min (stretching while massaging your baby) and Stroller Boogie - 2 min (using a rubber band to workout with your stroller). I gave it two stars because I did enjoy it as a part of the FitMama video."
2,disappointing -- not enough!!,"I am a big fan of Leisa Hart's FitMama prenatal video, and used it three times a week throughout my pregnancy. However, I am disappointed with this one. WARNING: this video is only 18 minutes long! And that includes all the talking. Furthermore, although the first set of exercises is great, I found the set using the stroller to be pretty much useless: I can't drag my dirty stroller into the middle of the living room!It would be nice if Leisa could have come up with some more exercises that don't need props. Sure, with a small baby, one might not be able to do more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time, but, for the money, we should be given more material. It would be great to have 2 different routines for alternate days.For now, I'm taking lots of brisk walks with the stroller."
1,Not enough,"I'm disappointed with this video. Its very short (18 mins), expensive, and I don't think it is a complete workout.I loved Leisa's prenatal video, but this one is not worth it!!!"
3,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this video. Much of the work is done with the baby facing away from you, and I really didn't feel that it was much of a workout. Also, very short."
1,Not Worth It!,"I was disappointed when I purchased this video. The video is only 18 minutes long with half of it showing you how to massage your baby and exercise your baby's legs,etc. The exercises for the mother's workout are very simple and repetitive. You only need to watch the video once, then you can do the simple exercises on your own. It is not a video to buy. It is a complete waste of money."
1,I missed that this was the easy version,"my bad - Needed the full score, but I'll find some child to gift this to."
1,No Lyrics Only Piano Part,I was led to believe that this item featured lyrics and accompaniment but it only features the piano part. I am not happy about this and have returned the item.
4,Review by Francis Mcgill,Joseph is one of many brothers. He is his dad's favorite so the brothers don't like him much. Joseph is given a colorful coat by his dad wich gets the brothers very mad. They sell him into slavery. Potiphar is a rich man in Egypt and he buys Joseph. Joseph gets thrown into jail because Patiphar's wife is flirting with him. He becomes well known because he can interpert dreams. Will he get out of jail?
2,"This is the 2nd not the 3rd edition (Note carefully, students!)","Be careful. I ordered the book without realizing that this is the 2nd edition, not the new 3rd edition that most professors will ask for. Now it is too late! It doesn't include the charts."
1,IS NOT 240 MIN.,THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE. IT IS GREAT. MY BITCH IS AMAZON SAYS ITS 240 MIN. GOT DVD AND ITS 171 MIN.I HAVE THE 171 MIN. TAPE ALREADY. SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU HAVE THE 171 MIN. MOVIE.THIS ONE IS NOT ANY LONGER AS AMAZON STATES.
2,Somehow-not as good as the bottle version,"I found this to be pretty good with bird droppings...and not bad on paint-which may be because I had some wax on the paint. But it is terrible on glass and even letting it soak for up to 10 minutes, it did not do a good job unless I used it 5-6 times. I had better results with nail polish remover and even things like WD40.I've used the Turtle Wax Bug and Tar remover than comes in the metal can, it works much better. One good thing about it is that it wipes off easily. If only the pine tree sap came off with it..."
3,Works Within Limits,"I like that the product goes on as a foam and stays on the spot to be treated. Our year old Legacy had quite a few dried sap blemishes on the finish and even with repeated treatments, none of the blemishes budged. A couple fresh bird bombs came off easily, but for those stubborn, dried-on catastrophes, you'll have to look elsewhere for a hero.My next effort will be made with Goo Gone car formula. If that doesn't work, I'll try the claying road."
1,Product simply does not work,"Followed instructions exactly, took car through car wash first, even did it at night so surface would be 100% cool as per instructions.Had absolutely no effect whatsoever on pine tree sap. There were even some areas that had VERY light amounts of pine tree sap, and it didn't even work on them."
1,4 applications and still no luck!,"Like the other reviewers I had no luck with this product. It does leave a nice shine and smells good, so for that I gave it 1 star. I tried 4 times applying the product to some bug splatter and tree sap which had accumulated on my vehicle for the past 2-3 weeks and no matter what the tree sap would not go away. The bird crap came off, but left a residue and stain that won't come off. Too bad, i normally use Turtle wax products but i will not be buying this again."
2,"Great car wax, doesn't remove squat","Claims to remove tar, bugs, sap; maybe if the stuff is still very fresh. The Turtle Wax did absolutely nothing, but give a great wax shine to the bug splatter and pine sap. A cheap bottle of nail polish remover instantly removed all the crud, and cost allot less. The nail polish remover did not hurt the car finish or clear coat. The only reason I gave it a two was even though it didn't work, I love the spray on, wax off shine it gives."
1,doesn't work on sap,I had high expectations for this product but it absolutely does not removesap.. how can it remove TAR? waste
1,Turtle Wax didn't work,"I carefully followed the directions, and Turtle Wax Bug and Tar Remover did absolutely nothing to remove the bugs from the front of my car.Darn, I should have read these Amazon reviews before buying this stuff. My fault. I bought it thinking the Turtle Wax brand name would ensure reasonable quality. I won't be buying any Turtle Wax products in the future."
1,Not effective on tree sap,"I had to repeat the ''spray on and wait one minute' process several times before the sap would come off. Even then it would only come off if I vigorously scrubbed it with a plastic scrub. It did not leave a clean surface (as advertised on the back of the bottle) but instead left my windows very waxy and impossible to see out. I had to wash it off with a hose to regain visibility. Would not recommend.Note: Tree sap had been on the car for several years, this may have been why it wasn't effective."
2,I don't get it,"This product doesn't seem to remove bugs or tar from the front of my car better than Windex or water. I followed the directions, waited a few minutes, and tried to wipe it and the bugs off. Well, it smears everywhere and the bugs stayed. Went to the car wash and blasted them off with a pressure washer... I wouldn't buy this product again."
2,Doesn't work on old bugs,Drove to St. Louis & back a few times in the last two weeks from Chicago so plenty of late spring bugs smashed all over front of my white car. Multiple applications of TW Bug & Tar have achieved very little cleaning. Seems if you don't get bugs right away this product has little penetrating power to lift & remove a bug you should have wiped off @ the end of your trip. Elbow grease is really what it boils down to if you don't get the critters off right away so save your money & use a gentle soap formulated for car finish.
1,NOPE!,"Does not work good! Well if you want to scrub it does but if your ganna scrub save your money and just use detergent and warm water!A few years ago there was a bug and tar remover and I can not remember the name of it that I used. It was super good! You sprayed some on a rag and wall la those little suckers disappeared! It did not harm clear coat, maybe wax but come on if it's going to be a bug remover boo who wax again."
1,Way too agressive for the paint,"I followed the instructions, applied the bug & tar remover and then waited a few minutes before wiping it off. I probably forgot a few spots that dried out ... and to my surprise it left streaks on the auto body that cannot be removed afterwards. I have tried to wash the car, applied some polish and it does not come off. Turtle wax says this product is better than any run formula ... at least the run formula will go away with water, this one needs a cloth ... not really convenient ! Do turtle wax actually test their products on real cars before they sell them ? You wonder ! Stay away from it if you like your car paint."
5,One of the scariest books I've ever read.,"I thought the beginning was a little confusing, but once I got into it I couldn't stop reading- it actually took me just two afternoons to finish the book. Although I don't really understand why everybody thinks it's so much like Steven King. I've never been a big fan of King's, but absolutely love this one. Much better than any Stephen King book I've ever read (maybe I haven't read enough of them?). I agree that the ending could have been abit better though."
4,ending was a letdown,"I found it extremely scary, very hard to sleep in the silent house! But felt badly let down by the ending, what's to say there is not another 'lynx'? It's not the end is it? highly enjoyed reading it though."
3,OK but somewhat disappointing,"Basically a group of elderly storytellers are attacked by the ghost of a shape-shifter they accidentally killed years before! The suspense is good, and I thought the characters were OK, but the story didn't really make a lot of sense and the ending was disappointing."
3,"Good story, bad writting","I don't know what it is about Straub. He's got a great imagination, great story ideas and plots, knows how to toss in plot twists... but he writes like my old history teacher: long winded and hard to follow. Like several of his other books I've read, I had a really hard time keeping up with this. It seemed all over the place. You'd be with one character for awhile and then you'd have a fifty page flashback and then end up following along with someone else you were barely introduced to before then have another fifty page flashback... and in the mean time just confused due to his very odd writing style. I've never had to go back and reread sentences so often with any other author.In the end it was a good story marred by bad pacing, bad writing, and fairly incomprehensible plot at times."
2,Boring!,"Because I am a beloved Stephen King fan, I actually took HIS advice and read this book. I was very disapointed. I actually had a hard time finishing the book and when I got to the last 30 pages or so I just skimmed through them and was relieved to have it over and done with. What a boring and tedious book this was."
1,dull,"this is one where the movie is better than the book....found the book to be just plain dull. just seemed to wander all over the place, would not recommend it."
4,Great Start. Muddled ending.,"I've read only two of Straub's books, this one and ""Lost Boy. Lost Girl."" The latter is definitely more consistant, but ""Ghost Story"" has more moments of brilliance. In fact, if the second half had been as good as the first, it would probably rank as one of my favorite novels EVER (if not THE best). Unfortunately, once the evil force is no longer a mysterious entity (it is explained in excruciatingly disappointing detail), the creepiness ends and it becomes a convoluted monster hunt. By the time I reached the bizarre and rather anticlimactic conclusion, I didn't care anymore.Despite my disappointment with the conclusion, I still consider this one of the scariest books I've read in a LONG time."
3,Difficult to finish,"While I certainly enjoyed a large majority of this book, I have to say that the whole thing is not as good as the sum of its parts. While many of the segments are outstanding, my overall impression is that the main basic plot was filler that left me feeling unsatisfied in the end.The flashbacks were very compelling and were, to me, the best part of the book. But, they could have also been the reason that the book didn't quite meet my expectations. I felt that the pacing was off a bit. At one point, I almost became frustrated by the interruptions. By the time I reached the novel's climax, I had nearly lost interest in the main story line."
3,I feel bad....,"I feel bad because so many people obviously believe this to be the scariest book they have ever read, but yet I can count the number of times I got goosebumps from this book on one hand. Perhaps I'll have to read it again at another time, but I was not all that impressed. Also, I kept being distracted by the poor writing and editing of the novel. Still think ""Bag of Bones"" is the best true ghost story I've read."
1,Never been so glad that my dog ate the book,"I'm an avid reader, and was looking forward to this book, which was recommended in an article on favorite choices of book clubs. After working my way through the first 200 boring pages which were not even particularly well-written, I was about to just give up when my puppy got hold of the paperback and shredded it. Turns out she did me a favor. How in the world did this book get such good reviews?? I'm stumped."
1,Booorrring! Way too long,"This story started slow and remained that way. There are so many character I forgot who's who. Plugged as a horror story is wrong. The scary bits, if you can call them that, are few and far between. The story is predictable and a hard read.There is no value for money."
2,mediocre at best,I have been reading mostly sci-fi lately and wanted to try something new. I used to be a big Stephen King fan and had heard of Straub but never read him. This book has some stellar reviews so I thought I would give it a try.I must say I was sorely disappointed. The first two thirds was mind numbingly boring and the last third was simply contrived foolishness. And for a horror story it wasn't scary at all. I'll take classic King over this any day. I guess its back to sci-fi for me...
3,A fine story but not scary,"I read several reviews in which the reviewer considered this the scariest book he/she had ever read. I bought this book expecting to be unable to sleep at night or at least unable to put the book down. On the contrary, I was often bored and never scared. I am a person with a vivid imagination, if I hear a strange noise while in bed I will sleep with the lights on! But this book didn't give me goosebumps and it didn't keep me up all night. I would would call this an interesting story, but not a horror story at all."
2,An enormous disappointment,"I'd been saving this title for twenty years, and finally decided to read it based on how many good reviews I'd read of it. I was utterly disappointed: although the smalltown in wintertime atmosphere was beautifully evocative, the fight with the ghost didn't seem scary at all, but rather dully cinematic (there's a huge fight at the end, and then another even more enormous fight after that, and the great teaser of a beginning is resolved after that in a somewhat pedestrian fashion). I think what was most disheartening for me was how derivative the book was: the first story of the Chowder Society is clearly a reworking of ""The Turn of the Screw,"" and much of the rest of the story relies heavily on Steven King's SALEM'S LOT in both its plot and its method."
2,Not Much Here,I borrowed this book from the library after reading the four and five star reviews on Amazon. It was very disappointing to find out that it was not scary as advertised. The characters never come alive and the situations in which they are involved are implausible. I kept expecting to be caught up in the story but it never happened.
3,A peculiar story with many layers,"Having read Straub's collaborations with Stephen King (The Talisman and Black House), I wondered what contributions Straub made to these tales of fantasy. Starting with Ghost Story was a good idea because it is considered by some to be his perennial work.The story moves slowly at first, as you are introduced to the Chowder Society (two characters - named James and Hawthorne - entertaining). The reader is then submerged story into story as the narration shifts. This truly speaks to Straub's adeptness with language and narration as it is really easy to keep characters and situations straight.For me, the novel fell apart at the end. I felt that some things needed more explanation and the character of Eva Galli was somewhat problematic for me. I enjoyed the reading experience, and will probably read more Straub in the future."
5,Spooky,"After I read this book, I was recommended Dean Koontz's ""Door to December."" In comparing the two, Door to December was not scary to me, nor was the ending (in my opinion) surprising or innovative. Typically, I don't like stories that deal with the supernatural. But Ghost Story is different. It is a book that draws you in right away, and the entire story is chilling, from beginning to end.My favorite part of this book is how the ending ties to the beginning. All through the book I tried to figure out how the first part fit in with the rest of the book, and I thought how it ended up was terrific. A great read!"
3,The abridged audio cassette version is too short,"I haven't read GHOST STORY in many years, but I remembered enough to be annoyed by how much was missing. This is a thick book reduced to both sides of TWO cassettes. I'd hate to think what idea I'd have gotten of the story if I didn't have my memories of the original to help flesh things out."
2,This book is not scary,"This book is as scary as any B-movie you are likely to see. Very predictable and not really worth your time. The only thing that really scared me was the thought that the book is slowly coming to its end and nothing is going to happen. My fears were not baseless. Since I really like SK and he recommends this guy (and worked with him) I guess I'll give him another chance - maybe Lost boy, lost girl."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","Just finished this five-hundred-page mess. I have never been so bored or frustrated with a novel as I found myself with THIS one! Unnecessarily long, unnecessarily wordy, and as frightening as an episode of The Brady Bunch, this novel trudges on forever, is terribly anti-climatic, and fills the reader's head with so much rambling nonsense that, by page 180, I considered abandoning the read. But, I hung in there--hoping the story would improve with each page--only to realize that this unnecessarily complex mess of characters and plot lines only gets worse. The most thrilling aspect of the story is FINISHING it--never to have to read it again! Huge waste of time."
4,Spooky Scary,Good novel. It kinda just jumps into a lot of stuff and can leave you feeling a little lost at first. Stick with it and be rewarded though.
4,One of the eeriest novels ever written...,"This novel will haunt you for a long time. The suspense just boils over and I found myself racing through it to get to the next scene. So much so, that I had to go back and reread some passages for tiny details I had overlooked. The characters are so well drawn - even the secondary ones - that you feel like you know them (or knew them.) I finished this book in a marathon 200+ page session, and when I was done, I was drained. I will not outline the plot - that has been done to death. Straub sets up the story with surgical precision, and the ending is one of the best I have ever read. However, I found myself wondering about some loose ends in the story. But I guess that is a sign of any great book - you carry it with you even after you have put it down."
3,What?,"I had a hard time following this book. Although each ""section"" was very interesting putting the whole book together did not happen for me. First PEter Straub book I've read and hoping his others aren't so confusing!"
2,not worth reading,One of the those books where the only reason you even bother to finish it is because you've already read so far. It starts off with a definite air of suspense and terror but I thought the ending really didn't seem to fit. The heros in the book are up against this supposedly shape shifting monster that has been here since the beginning of time and yet the way that they kill her is so mundane.
4,Too Convoluted,"I must admit, I read this book at a time when I was going through a torrid love affair, and that my comprehension as such wasn't the best. But, what I find in this book is this--there are too many subplots. The first thirty pages reads like a Dean Koontz novel. It details a kidnapper and a girl. But what Straub does all too often is his habit of dropping subplots and substories. Every time this book got going Straub dumped the interesting parts in favor or the aristocratic Chowder Society that spun their wheels for nearly 600 pages. This is a fine, fine book. But it is NOT as good a book as Shadowland; a book with less subplots and more effective and satisfying at one-hundred less pages."
4,"The book was good, but the movie was better","This book is quite enjoyable, although the ""shape shifter"" explanation of Eva Galli's existence I found was a let down. The movie includes Fred Astaire as Ricky Hawthorne and the beautiful and scary Alice Kriege (Star Trek First Contact, Chariots of Fire) is absolutely captivating as Eva, and I am now a fan of hers. In the movie, she is simply a ghost who comes back to haunt the Chowder Society, and I found this more compelling and scarier. The book, however does develop the other characters more fully. I just didn't buy the shape shifter concept - I don't think science fiction concepts fit in well with ghost stories. My recommendation is to read the book after viewing the movie"
2,Tedious and boring all the way through,I really had to force myself through each chapter of this so called horror masterpiece. Straub is a good writer in his own right but this book just didn't do it for me. It wasn't overly predictable but the character's actions were frustrating. I've never had such an incredibly difficult time finishing a book.
2,"I really tried to read this, but......","I picked up this book based on the recommendation by Stephen King in Danse Macabre. I liked the mood and the basic premise of the book, but the constant shifting in viewpoint between the characters and the jumping back and forth from the present to past events just made me quit reading half way. It just became too irritating and with over a year's reading to do on my bookshelf, I just couldn't justify spending any more time on it. I am sure more forgiving readers will enjoy the novel, but I personally expect a novel to be structured in a way to encourage the reader to keep reading. Unfortunately for me, it ceased to be fun and became a chore instead.This is only the third book that I have started reading and didn't finish in my entire life. It was that bad for me. With the praise I keep reading about Straub, I would be willing to give him another shot. But it won't be this book."
1,The movie is far better,"I don't think I've ever given up on a book with only 100 pages or so to go, but I did this with this one. I just browsed through the remaining pages to see if it got better at any point (it didn't). I was very disappointed by this book, I expected something better considering all the praise it has received, and also I had seen the movie and I had found it very scary and haunting. In fact the change of concept in the movie (to make Eva a ghost coming back to haunt her killers, instead of this obnoxious shape-changing thing) was a winner. This book is Stephen King at his silliest, with all that stuff about characters behaving erratically because of some supernatural and all-seeing influence, etc. but I have to say that even at his worst King can infuse more spirit, interest and life to his stories and characters. If you are die-hard fan of Stephen King's IT and suchlike books, you may like this one; otherwise, don't bother."
2,Meandering and pointless,"If you enjoy being dizzy (and I don't mean with delight or excitement) then this is the book for you. It constantly is hopping you backwards and forward in time, not only that, but you are constantly hit by a slew of new characters (all peripheral and mostly unimportant) aunts, uncles, friends, sons, dentists, doctors insurance sales men...MAKE IT STOP! Enough is enough. I read this book and it would end up irritating me to the point of putting it down. I like an interesting and complex plot line as well as the next person, however, this seems self serving and written just to show you how damn clever Mr. Straub is and how stupid you the reader are for being unable, or unwilling, to follow along with this meandering and endless tale. I normally like most things but I really hate this. Very disappointed!"
1,Do not buy this book for any use other than a sleep aid,"After reading so many good reviews on this book, I decided to get it and give it a shot. I had read something by the same author many years ago and remember disliking his writing style (I felt it was on a 6th grade level), so I stayed away for a while. While I don't feel that the book was poorly written, it definitely was NOT good. At all.This book is not scary. This book is not good. It's not even interesting. About 50% through the book there was one ""tense moment,"" and the rest was drivel. By the end of this predictable book, I just couldn't wait for it to end. Finishing this book was a sheer act of willpower, and an agonizing few days. I would never read this book again, or recommend it to anyone. I will probably never read this author again either. I can't believe the book has so many positive reviews, it boggles my mind...(...)"
3,slow moving and predictable,"Ghost Story, unfortunately, didn't age well. Unlike more modern ghost stories, the plot is ponderous and predictable. Probably innovative for its time, but now, an old tale told lengthily."
4,only book I had to stop reading because it was too terrifying,"I read this book (about half of it) years ago and I had to literally stop reading it because it was too scary. This is the only book, of all the hundreds I have read, where this happened. It made my heart pound - I was terrified and spooked. I was a lot younger then - I am going to give it another try. I never forgot this book. It stayed with me all these years."
1,Check out tech support before you buy...,I bought this camera based on the reviews I read here. I spent a half a day attempting to install the Kodak EasyShare software from the CD with no success. I eventually managed to connect to their web site to try and download the software but it is just as buggy and wouldn't install.The drivers did load and I am able to connect to the camera and transfer the photos to my computer using Windows Explorer. I do have some other graphics software so it is not a total loss.If you're smart you will go to a company's web site and see if they have a phone number for tech support and see if you can contact them before you buy anything. Kodak has no such tech support numbers for the US on their web site. I'm really upset with myself for relying solely on these reviews.
1,Gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it no stars...,You may want to stay away from Kodak. I bought this based upon the other reviews that were posted here. I was unable to install the Kodak EasyShare software from the included CD after several hours of trying which basically makes the thing useless if you are unable to transfer the pictures to your computer. I have also been unable to connect to [their website.] Nobody home...I would sure recommend buying from a local store where you can at least get some assistance or return [stuff] that doesn't work to get a refund. After wasting a half a day of my life on this junk I'll now have to go to the trouble of boxing it up and sending it back.
1,Please Beware,We purchaed the CX4230 as our first digital camera and like many of the reviews posted we were pleased. But after about two months we started having problems with the camera turning on and off on its own. We have sent the camera in three times and now Kodak has sent us a refurbished CX4230. To send the camera back in for repairs you have to go through tech support (Good luck). This company is big business and does not care about its customers. I would stay away from Kodak products entirely.
4,Has its moods but works fair,"The quality of pictures - which is the most important factor for me - is excellent. Taking pictures during a sunny day is a pure pleasure.I admit sometimes it acts weird when you want to transfer pictures using either docking station or by a direct connection, but i tried both ways - they work fine.Sometimes I'm having problems when I turn this camera on - I guess it's the batteries - but have to see it again.And because I live in Poland I'm using this camera with an adapter (220V) and I don't have any problems with power or charging batteries.In general, I'm satisfied with Kodak CX4230.Added (Oct, 2003): It turns off on its own.. You have to hit it to turn it on... Poor thing.."
1,Why exactly do we need the docking station?,"I bought this camera last year and I have not been happy with the results. First the camera (not the user) decides wheather it's going to use the internal or the memory card on any given day. The only way I could get my pictures to save on the memory card is if I hit the side of the camera a few times. Let's just say I misses many of those precious ""kodak moments"" fooling around with this tempermental camera. The why exactly do we need a docking station? My so-called ""charged battery"" lasts for a maximum of two hours. We can ""easily"" transfer the pictures my sticking the memory card in the computer. Once again I think the whole docking station idea is a way for kodak to make consumers think we need to buy yet another accessory to make everything ""easy."" Most of the pictures I have taken have came out way too dark- even after I changed the flash settings. The camera is getting serviced as we speak to lets see what happens~"
1,Pure Junk!,"After two weeks of waiting for this product I installed all the software, took a few test pictures clicked the ""Share"" button and waited for 20 minutes ""Serching for media"" computer froze. I tried this several more times that nigth and finaly gave up with the thought of calling Kodak Tech support in the morning.I wake up call Kodaks friendly tech support, they do have semi decent support, after 5 hours of them telling me it was cause I have an IRQ conflict, and three calls, I gaveup with their tech support and decided to fix my IRQ for my USB so that it wasnt sharing a n IRQ with my sound card. (note never had IRQ issues with any USB device ever before)I fixed it so that the USB had it's own IRQ and step up the software, camera and took a few test shots again.....SUpirise it froze my computer AGAIN. So I went to my buddies house to try it on his computer...yeah I didnt give up easy on this...and had the same results. I knew I should have bought a Sony!"
1,Terrible book,"I guess if you're a fan of Robbins, you might enjoy this. But the whole thing is full of boring, cheesy sex scenes, idiotic prose, and half-connected plot lines. None of the characters are interesting or believable, and you won't care what happens to any of them. In my opinion Robbins' style leaves a LOT to be desired. I do not recommend this book and plan to steer clear of Robbins' work in the future. Don't waste your money."
3,Not really a dress sock,"These socks are of high quality, but they are too thick to be paired with dress shoes. Also the blue color is a little too blue for most business attire."
2,Not what i expected,I expected a nice sock that will keep my feet dry and comfy all day. Not this sock. You can feel the seams on the toes. They are not soft. They do not keep my feet dry.I might send them back to the company since they have a 30 day guarantee. I would recommend trying Smartwool. They are a far superior sock.
2,I was not pleased with this product.,"Although the size was supposed to be X-large, they were very small! They were way to small for me and I just wear a size 10 shoe."
5,Product,Great sock in performance and style. Will buy this product again just wish they offered more range of colors such as brown and navy.
2,Not quite what I expected,For the price I expected a good quality sock. What I got was a padded sock that doesn't stay up. Very dissappointed.
3,Great socks but the price is too much,Sure the socks are nice but geez that price.... I tend to be a little more thrifty but thought I would try these... After wearing them a few times I just can't justify paying that price...
2,too much personal touch,"While reading the book I noticed way too much of the author's take about TCC in what I would have liked to be a presentation source material.And, I have large misgivings about this take, 2 examples follow.Using such generics as 'energy' to correspond to specifics such as chi or jin is not acceptable.Not differentiating between physical structures such as the yao and the chi organ ming men is another blunder.I'll finish reading it, in time, I hope, but the original joy of reading a new book is gone for me.David L."
4,Awesome!,"This is the fourth Aliens novel that I have read, and it is by far the best of the four. Awesome story! You never knew if you could trust a few of the characters, which reminded me of watching Ben Linus on ""Lost."" Although I have to say that the parts focused on Paul Church's experiments in the Hive made me feel sick to the stomach. A must read if you enjoy the films!"
5,Great mellow acoustic!,"What a wonderful CD by the lead singer of The Great Divide! Most of the tracks are acoustic and they are so full of soul! Mike truly is a gifted song writer--all his tunes are so easy to relate to from self doubt to self appreciation to spiritual realization, etc. I truly cannot listen to only one song on this CD--it is a full listen through every time! I have a very tough time only listening to ""Marleigh's Song"" once--always a repeat. The song makes me want to have children--and if you knew me, you'd have a tough time believing that! If you're into music that touches you deep in your soul and makes you realize that you're alive--pick this one up!"
3,"Darker color than appears online, and 3/4 sleeves","I bought the light blue ""Suns"" pattern. The shirt is much darker in color than I expected, and the sleeves are 3/4 length. The length is also short, overall - I'm afraid of shrinking. All in all, it is ok, but just ok."
2,Two good stories,I would've loved to have read more about Brooklyn itself in these stories. But most of them are mediocre tales that just happen to take place in Brooklyn without much reference to the locale. Two good stories. The rest pretty dull. I think the Noir series is getting stretched a bit thin.
4,Engaging.,"At age thirteen, Reissmann is liberated from the confinement behind the Berlin wall. This experience launches him on a steep trajectory for escape that has him on adventures that would make the hands of most hardy travellers begin to sweat. His succinct and poignant satire begins to unravel as he disappears further into the jungles of South America, and further into his own subconscious, ultimately emerging reconstructed, as someone quite different. His exotic and extreme experiences form a prism of destruction and creation through which we can all see our own lives. It's a compelling read and a universal story."
4,too small,"Mi cousin like very much the toy but I think is too small for the price includin s & h I think is a little expensive, anyway my cousin like it very much."
1,Venom isn't supposed to be purple!,"Why is this figure purple? The symbiote is black, Spidey's black suit is black of course, so this figure should be black too. Hasbro really screwed the pooch on the entire Spidey 3 figure line. Don't waste your moneyon these figures. You can do a lot better than these plastic pieces of garbage."
3,"Just the pots, please","I just started collecting Russel Wright dishes, and was looking for a definitive reference guide to help key out the pieces I had. I thought this book had a lot of helpful information about determining pattern and manfacturing locations, but I was a bit disappointed overall. Though the cover of the book features only pottery, the book itself has examples of all that Russel Wright created in his long, prolific career-- all the way down to the radios and lamps. It would be great for the diehard RW fan, but I wished it just focussed on the pottery."
5,It Good,"Do you want Time Crisis for the Wii? Well you cant, but Ghost Squad is the next best thing. It is even up to 4 players. Best wii light gun games i got. I also have RE: Umbrella Chronicals, it was way to dark for me, to controls and much stuff in the game. I just wanted a simple shooter that was like Time Crisis and Ghost Squad did it for me."
3,Fun for $20,"This isn't the best shooter ever, but it's not the worst. The game consists of 3 arcade levels, all of which are short. Each level has 15 or so difficulties which open up if you successfully kill the ending guy of that level on the previous difficulty. You have a lot of lives, so the game is not too difficult.If you're looking for a light gun game (some call them rail shooters) for some dumb shooting fun, you'll be happy with your purchase. If you are looking for a long engrossing game you will be unhappy.I find that this game gets the most use when I have a lot of people over because an idiot could play this game, especially after you open up the good guns."
2,Good party game,The game is fun a first but gets boring really fast. The one player mode is bad and the game is only fun if you have friends over. This game was made for the wii zapper and is a good gun game if you have one. Also there are only 3 levels and each level takes about 5 minutes. Even if you do have friends over it gets boring really fast and it gets hard to tell witch sight is yours. Lastly it is a waste of $30 and *consider carefully before buying*.
5,Do you love shooting?,"I just wanted to put a note in here that this is an extremely fun game if you love to shoot.This game is also excellent for people who do not like the nauseating experience from other shooting games that shake the screen too much as you move.Even though the stages are replayed, they get harder and you get to unlock other paths not found in the arcade game ( I believe)I had a blast with this game!"
3,Wii Ghost Squad,"I bought it because of the price. It was cheap. We played it a lot for about 2 weeks. Now we have not touched it since. Good thing it was so cheap. It's not a bad game, just so many others that are more fun."
2,Multiplayer problems,"The multiplayer mode is a major feature of this game but the game will not recognize my second remote. All other Wii games recognize the other remote in multi player mode. Ghost Squad just flashes when I press the + button on the second remote. Without the multiple player feature, this game is not worth purchasing. I have not seen any resolutions to the problem of recognizing a second remote."
4,Ghost Squad,"This game is just like the arcade version. A little cheezy but A LOT of fun! It works with or with out a Wii gun. There are three levels that change depending on what you choose to do. My husband and I love it, we play together all the time!"
3,Fun for about an hour,"I was really excited to relive my Arcade Shooter days with Ghost Squad but it just didn't quite deliver. Overall it's a fun title and if you can get it for $20 or less then it's a must have but you'll probably have just as much fun renting it. After about the first hour of playing it starting getting ""same old same old"" status and it's a VERY short game, we killed it in an afternoon. The controller calibration is kinda flawed in my opinion as well. It really forces you to stand back father thatn you may want to, or have the room to. I also found my arm getting tired quicker than while playing other Wii games. However using the Wii Zapper this game really shines well, being able to steady your ""gun"" with two hands not only makes it easier to play but also adds that ""Arcade realism"" feel to the game. The levels are kinda blah and the graphics aren't anything you didn't see 5 years ago in the arcade BUT it's still fun, even if for only an afternoon or so."
4,"Fun Game, Needs More Missions",I really like this shooter. Easy controls and easy to play. I wish there were more missions and a VS. mode.
4,"Fun game, especially with friends","Ghost Squad isn't an incredibly long or deep game but it is a lot of fun to play, especially multiplayer. The graphics are decent. The gameplay is fast, fun, and has just enough variety to it. It won't take you long to beat the game but it's the type of game that you'll come back to and play again and again."
2,Too Short To Fully Enjoy,"I bought this product because it allowed 2 shooters at once. Maybe it's me, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do that, after repeated tries, yet. The game only has 3 levels (or maps). After that, there's no more. The levels that are there, are well done and of arcade quality. I just can't give it a high rating since it just doesn't provide ""bang"" for the buck due to its very short duration and lack of replay value. It does work very well with the SureShot handgun."
3,About Ghost Squad,I enjoy the game but I think It'll be better if you have control over soldier's movements. There are only three missions.
4,Great Light Gun Fun for your Wii,Ghost Squad is a short little light gun game that is lots of fun and offers tons of replay value. The price just makes it that much better. If you're a fan of the genre or you just like shooting stuff get this game.
3,A Few Hours of Fun!!,"I was excited for a multi-player shooting game. I have fond memories of the Lethal Enforcers games from the 90's and was hoping to get into that again. Ghost Squad gave me that, but only for a few hours. There are only 3 levels. Each level takes about 5-7 minutes to complete. With 1 player it was difficult to beat the first time, but with 2 players it was very easy. After you finish the game, you have the option of playing the levels again, and accessing new areas. I thought this was fun, but again, only for a few hours.I got about 5-6 hours of fun out of this, which made it a great rental. For only $[...], this game would also be a lot of fun for some mindless fun. Playing party mode, with 4 people is insanely fun and easy. It's worth a try.I say it is a solid rental, and for $[...], don't expect a lot of depth. It has replay value with the fun and interactive costumes, but in the end, it is just the same thing over and over."
4,Sega arcade goodness for the wii zapper,"As there are only a handful of shooters on the Wii designed for use with the new zapper it is hard to really split hairs. This is an ARCADE light gun game that doesn't deliver the big storyline gameplay length and arc that many gamers have come to expect from shooters instead GHOST SQUAD takes its ARCADE origins and puts them in your living room like VIRTUA COP on the Saturn before it. The zapper feels good as snapping offscreen to reload doesn't diorient as much as it does in some LG games.The reticle is accurate and is just sensitive enough for the games Sniper scenes. The characters landscape and gameplay have that classic SEGA feel and look and the unlockable weapons and costumes will keep you coming back to the three multi route levels alone and with a friend in multiplayer, how many times a day can the president get kidnapped? Short sweet and to the point if you have the Wii Zapper you want this game."
5,Charge!!!!,"My only complaint is I wish I had known about this game sooner. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!! We played it for four days straight over the holiday! We did stop in between to shove down some turkey and trimmings, and then went right back to it! I admit to killing a few hostages by mistake and a couple of times, we didn't rescue the President, but we did make it to level 4 on one of the missions. Not having the Wii gun is not a problem. The Wii remote works just as well. Had to get used to using the B button instead of the A button to fire weapons, but got the hang of that pretty quickly. If you don't have this game and you enjoy arcade type of blasting the enemy to pulp material, buy it!"
4,pretty good game,This is a nice game if you wanna enjoy some hours of fun without worrying about great graphics or a great history. It is really good as an action game.
1,Way too short,"This game is rally fun for untill you beat the three levels in the game! They have basicly the same three levels but change it to nighttime instead of day to pass as another level. I'm talking the same enemies in the same places, same mission. In Japan this game comes with the zapper so it is meant to be a quick short cheap game, but th en they sold it sepratly in the US as a full priced game. Unless you like to waste money, do not get this game."
5,Introduction to Sanskrit--Part One,"This was an excellent introductory book on Sanskrit. It was obviously written by someone experienced in teaching Sanskrit, and sensitive to student input. It was easy to follow and repetitive enough to give the beginning student a certain sense of mastery as each new piece of information would build on the last. I highly recommend it for any beginning student who may have found the Colson text entirely too overwhelming and confusing."
4,Good for beginners,"'Introduction to Sanskrit' provides a pedagogically sound introduction to Sanskrit. It is nicely slow-paced and thorough, and there are many exercises. The way it handles the introduction of sandhi (which tends to stick painfully in learners' throats) is particularly user-friendly: sentences are given both with and without sandhi applied until all rules of sandhi have been taught.My complaints are that the binding is flimsy and falls apart quickly; typos are frequent; and the prose is functional but simplistic and dull."
4,Confused,"I bought this book a few months ago. I have found it to be very clear and well organized. I'm enjoying learing Sanskrit very much. I also bought Coulson's book and I am a bit confused as to the differences in the devanagari scripts used in the books. Both claim to be teaching Classical Sanskrit so I don't understand why there are such huge variations. I've tried to find explanation for this on the Internet and other places, but I can't seem to find one."
3,A frustrating read on an intersting subject,"The author frequently goes off on tangents and rants that make deciphering the information difficult. Topics weave in and out of chapters and attacks on research done at Iowa State University further muddy the subjects. I get the feeling that the author is so passionate and knowlegeable about the subject that his typing could not keep up with his brain. Perhaps a stronger editor would have been able to keep the text better on track. One can gleam good information out, but at the same time, one is often left wondering 'why,' after reading many of the passages. This book might be a good springboard for further questions and research. It is not too scientific for the lay person to comprehend."
1,"Ikutsuki and Mitsuru's dad dies, Shinjiro dies, Chidori dies, the protagonist dies in the end and Pharos is Ryoji!","Also,*PLOT TWIST* Ikutsuki was evil and he was using SEES to help him conquer the world! The final boss is Nyx! This game was pretty awful. It was just full of grinding and nothing but that. Stay away from it and play better games. Saved 60 hours of your life."
3,"Great game, just not for me so much...","Well picked this game up after hearing a lot about it. It really sounded great. It was very different from some of the other RPG's I'd played. It started out pretty good, loved the whole school part of it and the dungeon crawling at night was fun as well. But it really started getting tedious to me. The story was ok, but it really just didnt hook me as much. I just wasnt able to finish it, I just started to get kind of bored playing the game and moved on to something else."
4,"A little disappointing, there is light at the end of the tunnel however!","Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this game. While I am a big fan of the MegaTen series, this game did come up a little short in some aspects. While I won't go into details that could be construed as spoilers, I will say that there are some elements in this game that are 'recycled' from some of the other MegaTen games, namely Nocturne. The Persona creation system in the game, however, more than made up for what was lacking with originality of some of the content. I can say though, that by the game's completion, you will be very satisfied with the outcome."
4,Natural Aromatherapy Soap Sampler,"I ordered the sampler pack for my wife for Christmas; I was pleased with the price (under $8), but when we got it I didn't realize that the sampler bars were so small (about the size of a hotel soap bar). For the price, I should have suspected that. They are very nice soaps though, and if you compressed it in to 1 bar, it would be a good price for the quality."
5,The best Lavender soap made!,"I ordered this soap along with the Lavender Bath Salt. I cant get enough =) I love the smell of both of them...it is really pure. Also, love how many suds it has. Makes me feel very clean."
3,Not what I expected,"Doesn't smell like Lavender but more of a combination of other things such as ""sage"" which has the most dominant-like aroma. I had to give this a rating of 3 because this bar feels nice and lathers up smooth, BUT I cant get past the awkward smell. I was just expecting to smell 'strictly' L.A.V.E.N.D.E.R and did not get that experience.I can inhale even the cheapest of anything that advertises Lavender and it smell like L.A.V.E.N.D.E.R this doesn't cut it for me. Nice packaging and fast delivery atleast I can say."
4,pretty ok,"hands still get dry after use, smell is not too strong. Overall ok lasts long. Better moisture than regular soap"
4,Decent overview of past assassinations,"I modestly recommend this video, as it is a decent overview of past assassinations. I did not care for the annoying ""official"" story re: 11/22/63 and Oswald but, other than that, this serves as a nice primer on the history of political violence in our country.Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
2,:-(,"The sleeves were ""whimpy"" and the ""collars"" were only about an 1/8 inch. They work but tip back and fourth."
3,"Basic, not superb","I'm relatively new to yoga, and to yoga DVDs, but I have to agree with ""Another Mom"" who also rated this three stars. While I like the high production values and variability offered by this video, Behl's instruction is sometimes tracked incorrectly with her movements, and there are no modifications shown or voiced for the poses. There is a nice ""instructional"" portion of the video which demonstrates these poses separately, but it would've been nice to incorporate or at least discuss the modifications in the actual routines.Nevertheless, this is a solid video, one that will be rotated through my home practice collection."
4,She is a great yoga instructor,She is my favorite yoga instructor and this video gives you a great workout and will tone your body. I just don't like the music.
4,Hemalayah Behl's Yoga for urban living,Fantastic video. I really enjoy this style of yoga and am so glad I ordered it. I have an option for a morning or evening 'quickie' or a longer session. I can choose 'cool music' with or without dialogue so its great for when you learn it so well you no longer want a voice over.The price was really cheap and even though there was a note it may not work outside of the US it plays fine here in Australia. Its my favorite online purchase.
4,Solid integrated yoga video,"I have found this dvd to be most similar to the yoga classes I take. This dvd integrates the methods of ashtanga, kundalini, and vinyasa. The empahsis placed on the warm up is welcome compared to some other yoga dvds. Hemalaya Behl is professional and soothing, but not too foo-foo. The 3 segments provide flexibility and when I don't feel like a vinyasa flow I can still get my yoga for the day in with the night time session. The one problem is that the cueing could be better. At times she is trying to provide verbal cues so that she ""mirrors"" the viewer, but the cues often don't match your movements. I just go from one side to the other and ignore which side she says to start with. But if you are new and need precise cueing this might be a dvd to buy after a few months of class work."
2,"sorry, better luck next time","As a yoga enthusiast, this was a slight let down as the routines are mainly basic and hardly draw a sweat or raised heart rate. This is of course not a sign of a poor routine-teacher, but I was hoping for a more rigorous yoga regime."
2,"slow, unadaptable workout",This is a relatively short and slow-paced workout. Not very interesting or well presented. i would not recommend this to anyone who has practiced yoga for any length of time. too many other better routines out there.
3,Misleading cover!,"I would like to give this DVD a higher score, but I am still a little annoyed over its misleading cover. The cover has a photo of the lovely Ms. Behl performing a yoga asana dressed only in an orange bikini. I assumed she would be wearing this pleasantly revealing costume for at least part of this DVD, but she doesn't! Most of the time she wears a bikini bottom and a more covering vest-type top. She still looks wonderful performing her asanas, but I just wish she was wearing that orange bikini. Maybe next time, Ms. Behl?"
1,Worked well for a little while,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas a few years ago. We were looking for an easier way to have access to our garden hose when and where we needed it.We were both very excited. It was much easier to cart our hose around the house depending on the task we wanted to do. It attaching and detatching the hose to the water was not as easy as I would have hoped - you have to disconnect from the water supply in order to 'reel' in the hose or the end gets all twisted up.The unit began to rust after only a short period of time; we have no space to keep the unit in the garage, so it stays outside. It is now all rusted out and the wheels no longer hold any air. We're going to have to throw it in the garbage.Seems like a lot of money for something we couldn't keep for too very long."
1,Not recommended,I bought this cart since I was tired of plastic carts cracking and falling apart with use. At least it took several years for that to happen. This thing sprang a huge leak in less than a year. Repairs will be close to what I originally paid. It's going out to the curb next week.
3,"OK, could be better","The item is pretty neat. However there were a couple manufacturing flaws which were troublesome. There is one piece that is pressed on the end of the turning barrel and it wasn't pressed on squarely which makes my barrel rotate in an oblong manner. The wheels are cheap and wobble pretty bad. Also, I ended up getting some more elbows to reroute the hose in a better manner than they suggest so that the hose does not kink like it does when you run it how the instructions tell you to. Now that I have made some modifications the product works much better than the plastic reel I used to have."
4,A great hose cart with a few minor flaws,"Overall I'm happy with that hose cartPros:- Holds 300 feet of hose without any problem- Price is reasonable- Heavy and sturdy. Big wheels roll over uneven ground without any problemCons:- The way the wheels are attached isn't the best, the cart doesn't roll in a straight line. Not a biggie, just annoying- The connector hose is of poor quality, I have fairly high water pressure at home and when shutting off water at the end of the hose rather than at the hose bib, the connector hose will not sustain the pressure building inside the hose. It burst in several places. After a couple of patches I ended up throwing it away and replacing it with a good quality hose, It hasn't failed me since."
1,Not as heavy construction,"Both units received did not match the items website description. Frame not as heavy, wheel/tire combo did not either.L. G. Lambert"
1,Missing pieces,"Items in box were haphazardly placed in box with a couple of pieces of cardboard and styrofoam, but parts appear to be in good condition. This is a 4-wheel cart but the box only contained 2 wheels. Liberty Garden Product's website has a warning not to enter the website or it could damage your computer - didn't go there! Can't call them because they're closed on weekends. What's the good of having Prime shipping if you can't assemble the cart when it arrives? It does appear to be a sturdy cart - if only I had all the parts! 1-star rating for now, but hopefully my opinion will change if and when I get two more wheels."
2,Not what the landscaper would have ordered,"If I was a professional landscaper, I would be screaming. I knew I was in trouble when the box said ""Made in China""! If this is their top of the line commercial unit, I would hate to see the cheaper versions. Poorly built. I wish I would have spent more for a better domestic unit. I don't see this lasting at all."
4,Just about all hose reel carts are the same.,"This is my 2nd hose reel cart. So here are a couple things to think about when buying a hose reel cart.1) (Make sure you can buy parts for your hose reel)... my first one was from Sams Club. You could not get parts for it. A specially designed brass part broke and I could not get a replacement part for it. So I'm turning that hose reel into a cart to pull behind the lawn mower. With this Liberty Garden hose reel, you can buy parts for it. ;-)2) (All hose reels in time WILL rust) Sorry. If its something that's around water in time will rust. After I got my hose reel out of the box and before I put it together I spayed painted it with Krylon. It took 1 can & a piece of another. That should seal it a little better. Plus too I wasn't crazy about the color of the hose reel anyway (tan). Now its green.Thats about it. Simple to put together. 2 metal shafts for the wheels make it a little more sturdier. I think they changed that design from the first ones."
3,Nice concept...doesn't last 1 year :(,I purchased this item in April 2011...by Oct. 2011 the brass square fitting that connects the hose to the reel was cracked and can not be replaced so now I have a useless hose reel cart!!! Worked great until this happen..
1,POS,"Received this hose cart only to send it back. The handle is way too short and makes moving 300' feet of hose a back-breaking experience. The also feeds over the reel in some peculiar fashion. If you are under five feet tall and have a very small garden to tend to, this may be the hose cart for you. Those six feet tall and over, forget it. I'll be buying a real hose reel this time!"
5,Hose reel,"This Liberty garden hose reel is a product, Reasonable price, Fast shipment, Easy to assemble, . Holds lots of hose. Highly recommend."
3,Certainly better than the plastic ones but.....,"The Liberty hose reel is more sturdy than the plastic ones I've had but I am very disappointed that the hose reel does not have a guide to help move the hose evenly onto the reel as it is wound up. You absolutely have to use your hands to keep your hose wound up tightly on the reel. If you just turn the crank, your hose will not wind up evenly across the wheel. This is disappointing for a reel that costs so much."
2,Decent.,"Compared to the other Sams Club brand, this cart is stable and works okay. I've had it for less than a year and I'm seeing rust form so the powder coating is not too good. My biggest complaint is the fact that everytime you crank it up or pull it out, the intake hose is not free spinning and gets bound up. This really sucks if you are using a quick release hose connector since it loosens the thread on the adapter and causes leaks. Other than that, no real complaints."
4,??? What is the Problem ???,"This is a good Portable DVD player. I bought this while I was in Basic training in 2003 (after I got out of basic) used it alot, and I was deployed in 2006. I took it with me to Iraq, and used it all the time. I never had a problem with it, It still works, so I had mine for 5 years, andit still works as if I had just bought it. I will say that my battery died on me and it's no longer good. But, after 5 years of use, can't really blame it. The DVD Player still works great on the AC Plug, and I am just getting another battery. Thats how I found this. This is the same model that I have, and it's a great little dvd player."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!,"I bought this player for my sister in August 2007. I think she used it two or three times before the screen went out. She mailed it to me, and I mailed it back to Audiovox, paying them to fix it. Over the next few months, I had to send the player to Audiovox TWICE in order to get the thing fixed. Now, after the last ""fix"", I used it myself for two hours and the screen went white. I don't know if the whiteness of the screen is related to low battery power or what, but it stopped working.My principal complaint is that the service/repairs are shoddy, and the company simply doesn't stand by its products. This has been a horrible waste of my time and money. I will *never* purchase an Auudiovox product again. EVER."
1,A RIP OFF!,"I have had to replace my Audiovox DVD Player twice! The first time was because the sensor was not reading the DVD; the second was because the rechargeable battery would not charge. And, now Audiovox is telling me that to buy a new battery will cost $79.00 plus shipping and handling. This cost is 3/4 the cost I paid for the 2nd audiovox. And, of course, they (Audiovox) will not offer any discount or compensation for their ""sad"" product. And, the sound/volume is horrible with earphones! Sometimes it's worth to pay for a quality name brand product, that has value!"
1,Buyer beware - it breaks,"I initially bought this because it had a 5 star rating at the time (though few had rated it). It worked great for a short while, then it broke after 4 months of use. This is shameful because we probably only used it for about 15 hours of portable viewing. We took very good care of it and the screen simply went out while we were watching it.We still use the DVD player in our bedroom, but the portable aspect is totally gone. The screen is no longer functioning.Don't buy this. There are hopefully better ones out there. We just placed an order on a new one. Let's hope we have better luck."
2,audiovox...hmmm,"first off,this is pretty nice except for the noise mine made.the picture is nice,so is the sound,but mine made like a constant chirping noise.and the next day i took mine back.i heard reviews that says it runs really quiet,THATS NOT TRUE!well im 12 years old and now i have a magnavox mpd720,it works and runs great,thanks magnavox!if your looking for one,get the magnavox mpd720!p.s.the reason im rating the audiovox d1708 2 stars instead of 1,is because the picture and sound is good,other than that,CRAP!!"
2,"Its great, UNTIL IT STOPS WORKING.","I am writing this review in hopes that you will listen to my warning and not buy this player. I wish I had listened to the reviews on other websites that gave the same warning. I bought this 6 months ago for my daughters birthday. Most of its use was in the house, hooked up to an extra television. I must admit that when it worked there was no problem with picture quality or sound etc. I now get a message that says ""no disk"". I now noticed the box does not mention the 90 day warranty, you have to read that after you buy it. I guess after I read the warnings I thought those things only happened to other people, I was wrong. You have been warned."
1,"Okay, if you don't want it to be a portable","My mom bought this particular portable player for my son because we were going to be on some long flights and she thought he'd handle it better if he could watch a few dvds. The picture and audio quality aren't that great, but not bad for the price. The only problem is that we can NOT get the rechargeable battery to charge. Therefore, it is useless for the purpose it was bought for. It still places if plugged into an electrical outlet, but there is no way to take it on the plane. I have not been able to find a replacement battery, but am assuming it might be less expensive to buy a whole new dvd player."
1,What a waste of money,"We purchased our DVD player in June 2005 from HH Gregg for $140. By December the screen would sometimes turn white so that we couldn't see the picture. Within a few months the screen stayed white all of the time, so that now we cannot play dvds at all. Audiovox wants $94 to fix it. I'm sure thats the cost of replacing it. The sound quality was never great, but we endured it. What a complete waste of money and theres no way I'm sending Audiovox another $100 for this or any other product."
2,Audiovox D1708 Problems,"I've owned this unit about 6 months, it worked fine until I left the battery uncharged. Unit is now completely dead, can't find a service center. Can't find a direct replacement battery pack. I don't want an auxillary battery pack hanging off the main unit. Don't buy Audiovox products, their service is non-existent."
1,broke pretty fast,This worked great for a few months but then the laser lens broke. Pretty useless now!
2,My problems with the d-1708,"I like the picture that the 1708 produces,but when playing dvd-r and +r's and +rw's the disc skip no matter what brand I use,and there is a motor noise when playing disc that can be heard on the right channel when using headphones.I'm sending it to audiovox for repairs.It seems to skip or strobe every 10 to 20 seconds so this could bs a firmware problem.The only workaround with the audio problem is to use the audio out in the back of the player you won't hear the motor noise,but the volume level is fixed, so you would need an headphone volume controller to adjust it, which can be bought."
2,Poor Quality,"We bought this to use in the car on long trips. After a short time, the cord that plugs the player into the cigarette lighter started to act up. It would short out and stop sending power to the player. The rechargeable battery does not work either. We still use it in the kids' playroom with the AC adapter only because we don't want to throw it out if the player itself still works. I wouldn't recommend buying this, this unit is poorly made."
2,Door broke after a few months,"I love that this DVD player will show movies that i've burned onto CDs.I hate that the door to load the DVDs broke after a few months, and then I had to lay a book on it so the door wouldn't spring open and stop the DVD from playing. I had to pick at it with a screwdriver to get the door mechanism fixed, but then it just broke again after another week.It's just a cheap, crummy little device."
1,Now I dont feel so bad...,"We had this unit just over a year before it stopped working. After reading these other reviews, I actually feel lucky! My daughter used this almost daily for about 4 months, then it sat on the shelf for a few months. When I got it out to charge it for a trip, it was totally dead. Went from working fine, to completely dead while sitting on the shelf. Now, with a trip in just 4 days, we are without a player...Will NEVER buy this brand again!"
1,HORRIBLE BATTERY!!!!!,"Ok, so, I received this portable dvd player for free, so obviously, I can't complain about the price. When I first used this unit, I loved it. The battery lasted almost 4 hours, the picture was great. The only downside was the tinny sound of the speakers. A pair of good headsets solved that problem.Then the problem started. I used this only three times, and now, the battery will not hold a charge. It works maybe 4-5 MINUTES before the battery shuts down.I have contacted the company, and they offered a new battery for 40 dollars. I was considering buying one, thinking maybe it was just my battery that was defective. Then I talked to others who bought this same DVD player. They ALL had the same problem. I will not waste 40 dollars on a new battery.The DVD player still works fine if plugged in to a AC outlet. But, what is the point of having a portable player, if you need to plug it in."
1,is there a zero rating?,"I bought not one, not two, but THREE of these (Model D1708). All THREE died within in about 20 hours of actual dvd-watching time. And just try to find the company (Audiovox) to repair it. No way. I've looked online forever to find somewhere I can send these 3 duds to no avail. Don't buy this product. Pay a bit extra and get one that will last a while."
1,Battery No Good,A portable unit that's not portable.... If the battery wont charge and stay charged for at lease one movie then it's not potable.... bad buy...we live and learn battery dose not work
2,Material is too soft,"As lug nuts go, these are too big for what they do, and the material is exceedingly soft. Make sure you hand start (you should anyhow) these or you WILL cross-thread them. I bought them as back up lugs for the race car, but are fairly well useless in this environment."
1,Wrong item sent,I was sent 4 small smoked acrylic handles instead of the 2 large smoked acrylic handles I ordered. The cost of return delivery made it meaningless to send them back for credit
5,A perfect dish.....,"Yes, the editorial review is correct - this can go from freezer to oven to table then in the dishwasher. I typically handwash mine and nothing sticks to them - very easy to clean. The poterie line coordinates perfectly with any Le Creuset pieces you may have. I especially like the oval shape for side dishes as it is a more attractive presentation when placed on the table or on a buffet.Even if you don't cook, this size is very handy to reheat foods. It makes any dish look better. This line is not as heavy as some pottery lines and that is a plus when you have a large, full dish of food. This size along with a 9x13 and a 8x8 should fulfill all your baking/cooking needs. I would add the small custard cups as they are wonderful for salsa or dips and if you bake you can make individual desserts in them.This line is sold in Williams Sonoma and that in itself is an indication of the quality of this line. Of course, the pricing and selection is better here at www.Amazon.com!"
1,"Like JD, this s**t's too short","This is one of the shortest cd's i own, come on JD, u can do better than this!Some of the seven tracks, however, are acceptable. Such as the WELCOME TO ATLANTA remix w/ P. Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Snoop Dogg.Another possible good one is the WHERE THE PARTY AT? remix off the HARDBALL soundtrack, it's pretty tight, but there's to much Jagged Edge on this record.Here's my good advice for JD:GO BACK IN THE STUDIO 4 ANOTHER CUPLE A YEARS TIL U HAVE MORE THAN 7 ... REMIXES, MAN!"
4,Great present for grandfather,I bought this book for my father who has just retired. It is a touching book with beautiful illustrations. My daughter enjoyed it but I think that it is a children's book that an adult would appreciate more than a child. If you are looking for a touching book to give your father-grandfather I would recomend this book.
3,"First Peoples, First Contacts","In general I felt the book was a very patch account of Native American people which was, afterall, its stated subject matter. It fails for one thing, at least within the written text itself, to give proper attention to the extreme diversity of that population. This is in large part due to the fact that the starting point of the work is the North American collections of the British Museum, which are necessarily finite and somewhat random, having more to do with the whims of the early collectors than to the conscious choices of curators, especially in the case of the earliest material. The photo illustrations of this collection, however, are worth the price of the book. Some of the artwork is priceless and irreplaceable. Of interest too is the material on modern Native American artists still working within the cultural contexts, media and traditions of their ancestors."
4,A good book to understand eastern philosophy,After reading this book you will get some insightful knowledge about eastern philosophy. It is very different to western philosophy in some ways. And it is good for you to see this world with less bias. I strongly recommend this book.
4,Good Christmas CD----Need More Orignal Christmas Songs,I love Jo Dee Messina but this was not my faviorte Christmas CD. How many artists can possibly do a Christmas album? They all seem to have the same songs on them. I have Leann Rimes Christmas CD and love it because there are more orignal works on it than other CD's. But still this is a great CD for the Christmas season.
3,Not Joyful Enough,"Spunky Jo Dee Messina seems a natural for Christmas music. Yet A Joyful Noise is her blandest release to date. Messina leads off with overly pretty takes on seven modern carols such as""Winter Wonderland"" and ""Silver Bells."" Even on the cheerful ""Sleigh Ride,"" her vocals are carefully enunciated and notes are never held long enough. Things pick up a bit on the three hymns that follow, particularly ""What Child Is This"" (poignantly backed up by Kenny Rogers), but it isn't until the final two inspirational originals (the title track, ""Keep The Faith"") that Messina finally cuts loose vocally. Ultimately, it's too little, too late."
3,Dasein,"This a a pretty good album from a talented band. It starts off on a good foot with a pretty solid indie rock sound. It sounds like At The Drive-In, which isn't a bad thing. However, track 4 is an obvious rip-off of ATDI's song Invalid Litter Dept."
1,False advertising,"I paid more than average for these sheets because they were advertised as ""Made in USA."" When I received the sheets, they were made in Pakistan. I did not order these to help out Pakistan but to help out American workers! Very disappointing!"
5,the sure thing!,"if your looking for a high quality, fakeish antique viola... look no further!! beatiful tone, quality, sound, and finish! all you could ever hope for in a viola!! :)"
2,Good starter book if the lighting was corrected,"The book doesn't have too many poses, however, it has several poses as seen from different angles(8 in all) which is helpful. However, the lighting on the models and the quality of print is so bad, that all images appear extremely flat."
1,Terrible Beeping Noises,"We bought the phone yesterday for what we thought was a good deal. Unfortunately, this phone is the noisiest phone I've ever tried. Dialing means you have to incur an annoying clicking sound, and hanging up involves a loud beep. Simply putting the phone on the base requires earplugs. Returning this sucker tomorrow."
4,Great Sexy Boot,"If you're looking for a great looking ad sexy boot, this is the one for you! I love how it fits, how it looks, and how comfortable it is. Looks great for a casual look and a somewhat dressy look. I've received tons of complement while wearing this boot."
3,The book was slow; Wallander stumbling.,"I thought the book slow and my dyslexic nature was easily distracted. Having recently watched several PBS Wallander presentations that were very entertaining and exciting, I selected this book as my first Wallander read. I was quite surprised at the sluggish pace of the book, and the unprofessional, stumbling manner of the book's Wallander character. I must say that this book was a disappointment as my first Wallander mystery."
3,"Good, but predictable","This was my first experience with the Wallander series and I looked forward to reading it after seeing the glowing reviews here. Although a translation, Mankell still comes through as an excellent writer and his characters, especially Wallander, have real depth. The story itself is ok, nothing out of the ordinary for a violence-numbed US reader. My complaint, and the reason I couldn't rate this book higher and am reluctant to read others in the series, is that I always felt ""one step ahead"" of the detectives. At a couple of points, it was like watching a bad horror movie where you want to shout, ""no, don't go in there alone!"" That kind of obvious deduction Wallander lacks in a couple of places in this book. Too bad, because the writing, characterizations and pacing are several steps above most detective fiction."
5,MURDERS MOST FOUL - MANKELL DOES IT AGAIN,"Wonderful Kurt Wallander! This is an exhillarating story which keeps you ""one step behind"", while the killer is ""one step ahead"". Since I read ""Italian Shoes"" Mankell has captured my attention (and my heart)with his unique storylines, nothing seems to be what you read because there is another turn just ahead that puts you back to wondering. Always inivative, Henning Mankell has you feeling sorry for poor Kurt one minute, then applauding him for his ability to think. This is a complex story, bound to keep your wits reeling. A perfect mix of the man (Kurt) the killer, and red herrings!"
5,One Step Behind - Wallender,"This author is not only one of my most favorite, but I've never read a book of his that I didn't enjoy immensely, especially the Kurt Wallender series."
5,One STep Behind,Very engaging novel - similar in style to the Donna Leon Venetian detective novels - but set in Sweden. I plan to read the rest of the series soon!
4,"Desperation, Depression and a Good Book","Do you enjoy detectives who are physically and psychologically at the end of their tether? Detectives who are unhealthy, sleep too little, drink too much coffee, obsess about their lost and messed up relationships, are physically miserable no matter what season it is? Detectives whose personality matches the geography and atmosphere of Sweden? If so you will get hooked on Henning Mankell's detective novels as I have. I have now read every one that's been translated into English and am tempted to learn Swedish to get into the two that thus far haven't been translated. I don't know why I like them. I can't explain it to anyone except to say it's a Scandinavian thing. Tom Christenson"
5,On a Midsummer Night,"On such a night, a group of students dresses up in 18th century costumes and goes to a private place in the forest to celebrate. Much later they are found murdered and there is not much of a trace to connect to this serial murder. Inspector Svedberg, who is on vacation, secretly investigates this case - and is shot dead. Inspector `kurt Wallander sure has his work cut out for him. Progress is at a snail's pace. Wallander is ready to give up in this atmosphere of despair. But he keeps going until he finally solves the case.A good book, although rather pessimistic."
2,One Step Behind: A Kurt Wallander Mystery (7),"Pros - I received book timely. All the pages were there. Good price.Cons - The quality was suppose to be very good. I thought the quality average at best. Some small pen marks and looks aged.I would buy again. Even though old, I can still read it."
3,"Story is good, but probably suffers from mediocre translation","A German coworker told me about this author, and I have to agree the story is good, but I suspect the translation into English isn't as good as the German translation. The writing style is too simplistic and lacks nuance. Since this author is extremely popular in Europe, I can only conclude that the translator didn't do a great job."
4,Quite a good read.,A good Wallander tale. Typical winding plot twists highlighted by Wallander's inner musings. Recommend it for any of his fans. Also would be a good first Mankell book for those new to him.
3,One of the very few books on the topic,"This book is poorly edited and too expensive for what you get. However, it is the only book I know of on the topic. It does an Ok job of describing the various techniques for motion estimation, and also delves into theory. What I like about this book is the many numeric experimental results that can be helpful in evaluating and comparing the various techniques. You may find this book useful as a supliment to some of the books on MPEG."
4,Landry's Restaurants fine cooking - a Treasure Trove of Recipes,"This little spiral bound cookbook is a great resource of the real Lousiana slow food recipes that brought Landry's restaurants their rightful fame. It has 50 pages of recipes plus an index. Using shrimp, crawfish, lobsters, fresh fish, chicken, pork, beef, lamb & oysters, the recipes in this book are mostly entrees, soups, gumbos, & stews, classic comfort food. There are also recipes for sauces & salad dressings, vegetables, and desserts including bread pudding with rum sauce. This is real-deal cooking as originally established in Lafayette Louisiana!"
1,Poor Quality,"Although the dealer took exceptionally good care of me, the product and it's replacement was lacking in quality. The stones kept falling out! I did receive a full refund and they couldn't have been nicer, I'd buy from them again if needed!!"
5,works great,"For a 50+ person who reads a lot for my job, this tool is excellent for notetaking and creating presentations, such as Powerpoint. The translation is a bit less precise than I wish at times, but that may be due to not having as steady a hand as I once had. Regardless, the time saved using the pen over hand written or typed notes makes this one of the greatest professional aids I have purchased in recent years, second only to my trifocals."
4,Wilson's Final Cut?,"Instrumentally and melodically, this is a brilliant album, quite possibly their best. Gavin Harrison's talent with percussion is especially impressive, mind-boggling and entertaining.But lyrically, it's the Final Cut, a la Steve Wilson. Been there, heard that. Celebrations of dark, unhappy childhoods have become so cliché, I just want to say, ""it's in the past, get over it, life's too short to sulk."" Show me something new."
5,Porcupine Tree's latest is INCREDIBLE!,"Fear of a Blank Planet is sure to please both old and new Porcupine Tree fans. The writing on this album is rhythmically advanced, harmonicallycomplex, and Wilson's writing just seems to get better and better despite his dark side. The title track is very catchy, the guitar is heavy but pleasing, and Gavin Harrison's drumming is stellar. The second track, My ashes, contains an ethereal and Floydian atmoshere with a luscious string texture. The 3rd track, Anesthetize, is 17 minutes and 42 seconds of greatness. Harrison's drumming is spot on, hypnotic, and beyond explanation. Alex Lifeson from RUSH contributes to this track as well. Robert Fripp also makes a guest appearance. If you like Floyd, space rock, tool, groove, odd time signatures, sound effects, keyboard texture, and something else which is unclassifiable, Porcupine Tree is the hottest thingout there in 2007."
5,"Dark, highly involved and interesting - a little different from the last 2 CDs","I've quickly become a Porcupine Tree fan. I purchased Deadwing and In Absentia first, and then followed that by getting older works. I think Steven Wilson is an amazing song-crafter (for lack of a better descriptor). When I first purchased Fear of a Blank Planet and looked at the total song count - 6 - I was a little disappointed. After I listened to it once, I was struck at the slight evolution their music appeared to take on it. Now, I can't stop listening to it. Gavin Harrison is an off-the-charts great drummer and he's had his chains loosened on this CD. Overall, this is a stunning piece of music, and has to be considered one of the very best from PT and one of the very best for 2007 period."
3,What a mess!,"This album makes me angry for what it could have been. This feels like an unfinished project. There's so many good melodies and hooks, but they go no where or don't last that long. These are great riffs and melodies that could have been turned into short 3 minute songs that would have payed off more. Especially the first song. Fear Of A Blank Planet. If it was shortened and more tightly edited. That would be a brilliant song, instead it's incredibly long winded, about halfway it starts to become what could have been another great song, but it's just thrown away to be the ending of the song, wtf? Every song is like that on this album. It's almost like they had a few really great songs, but not enough songs for a full album. So they mixed everything they had together and decided to make them all lengthy super tracks."
3,fear of a blank planet,Great title song. overall i rate this a three out of 5. not enough keyboards for me.
4,This is very interesting.,"I have never heard of these guys except by name. Until i bought this CD. And I ended up buying it out of curiosity. This reminds me a bit of... well I'm not sure what to say. They have a very unique sound that no one can define. And that is good if you are looking for something to stand out. And these guys definitely do. Lyrically, they have an unusual way they look at things, I guess. I have to get used to their sound. But I recommend this if you are looking for something different."
5,Incredible,"Bored kids, kids on drugs, kids who hate their parents, kids who waste their live in shopping malls, kids who listen to s***t like Pearl Jam, disillusioned kids....this is what this album is all about. Great lyrics, great sound, great drummer...God bless Steven Wilson."
3,Not Thrilled,"I guess I'm not the die hard fan that some of you are based on the reviews. I've listened to this and this release just doesn't blow me out of the water. It's the same vocal styling by Steven Wilson that can heard in Blackfield and even No Man. That just gets redundant. It's like Geddy Lee or even Steven Tyler screaming on each song back in their day that you expected to hear on each album. I'm beyond that and like a little variation and I just don't see that here. The sound that Wilson creates is the same no matter where he goes. So, beat me up for this review which is fine because that's what music is all about, personal taste. Either it's your cup of tea today or it's not. Maybe next time. Cheers!"
3,Dashed Expectations,"I eagerly anticipated the release of this CD for more of the great work this band has historically produced. I also wanted P.T. to contune evolving and this would be new material. Not so. Deadwing was better and going back to the compilation The Delerium Years was much better. I can no longer relate to being a pill popping depressed teenager, thank goodness, so the lyrics don't hold a good deal of value to me. The guitar work is as good as always but one cut seems to sound like the other. I picked this up with Blackfield II and much prefer that CD. I know the other reviewers are raving and I'll take the heat of knocking it down without saying which bar of which song justifies my disappointment...oh well, let 'er rip."
5,Musical Dope,"Dark, deep, powerful, wonderfully executed, artsy, rocking, audiophile quality, and melodic = I am undeniably hooked.Great band, great songs, not to be missed!"
3,listened to once recently saw live,Porcupine Tree is one of those special bands that deserve support. NOt too many Progressive bands in the last 20 years have signed on to major labels---Echolyn is the last band that comes to mind.Porcupine Tree has definatly carried a more pronounced metalic edge to their music compared to a more progressive LIGHT BULB SUN effort. I almost think of Porcupine Tree in the same genre as Dream THeater with out the nauseating double bass drum..ect...I prefer the older procupine tree however fans should buy this album especially if they like the last album. Please take into account I have heard this album only once so this is a knee jerk reaction on initial reflections. Rate betwwen a 2 and a 3 star
4,2/3 of a great album -- you need Nil Recurring,"The songs left off this cd, which are on the Nil Recurring cd, are essential to enjoying this album to its fullest. For some mysterious reason, the band chose not to include four great songs from the FoaBP sessions, but they are available on the Nil Recurring ep. If you have this cd, buy Nil Recurring and combine them into one disc. Personally, I thought that Fear of a Blank Planet was not as heavy--or as good--as In Absentia or Deadwing. But the addition of the four leftover tracks on Nil Recurring elevates it from 4 to 5 stars. Find it, buy it, and enjoy this album even more than you do now."
5,OMG,"This review is not really a review but more a strange (to me) historical comment. I was recently ""turned onto"" Porcupine Tree by Rush- I heard that Alex Lifeson was a guest guitarist on Anesthetize. I am 46 years old and have been a Rush fan since 1975 (well before most of you smarta** commentators were born : ) What is fascinating is that PT sounds nothing like RUSH but I absolutely love this music. This contradiction requires serious scientific investigation. Alex Lifeson likes them- and I'm guessing many other Rush fans will love this music even though it is very un-RUSH like. Many people have commented on PT's progressive style- but it has a very metal overtone as well. My 46 year old ears will certainly go deaf listening to PT- but I can't resist. Remarkable music- and I thought real music died long ago...Thank God for PT"
3,Incomplete wholeness,"Leave it to PT to extend this essentially bland retread into something at least somewhat satisfying, but the disc does seem to lack much of the memorable melody that keeps them in our heads ."
2,Repetitive pubescent whining,"I feel misled by the other reviews. The same pathetic lyrical content is recycled through every song: I am a bored teenager who hates my parents and wonders the mall stoned with no other purpose in life than to play XBox and feel sorry for myself. I don't know what motivated Steve Wilson to devote an entire release to this theme, but my copy is now in the round file. The music is OK, but not any better than previous PT. I recommend buying a different Porcupine Tree album if this is to be your first. I honestly enjoy Deadwing and still am interested in other material by PT and Steve Wilson."
2,Big disappointment,"As a long time dedicated PT fan, I'm always looking forward to the next PT album. Since Signify I know it takes about 10 listen sessions to get caught by the album. Usually the albums grow by each session but this one did not get me the first time and I quitted after the tenth. I miss the empty spacey atmospheres and I miss good songs. The second Blackfield fulfilled expectations, FOABP did not. FOABP, the best selling PT album so far, supplies a lot of riffs and catchy refrains. But this ship does not sail in any direction, it floats but does not reach any harbour. The new fans have a lot of brilliant PT music to discover and I hope SW wil be back on the track with the next PT album."
3,Prog-metal fans beware.,"Gavin Harrison is a monster on drums; Steven Wilson composes interesting music. But you need a whole band full of world class talent to do prog-metal justice, and they didn't bring enough talent to the table for that. It's good but not nearly good enough by prog-metal standards to merit 5 stars. The worst Dream Theater CD is roughly on a par with this. Granted - DT pretty much owns the genre, which PT generally is NOT a part of by any stretch... but with this release they ventured into those waters, and in so doing caused some prog-metal fans like me to waste money. Argh!"
2,The Big Yawn,"Save your money. You've already heard everything Wilson has to say here on Deadwing and In Absentia.I've been a big fan of Wilson's earlier works and I will admit the playing on FOABP is as good as it's ever been. However, the overall song writing has continued to slip. At this point he's just beating a dead wing. I mean dead horse...sorry I couldn't resist.Let's hope it's just a case of temporary ""writers block""."
5,Unbelievable results!,"Dr. Baillie Hamilton's theory of Chemical Calories is truly groundbreaking. The results achieved by the reduction of chemical calories in my diet has enabled me to achieve weight loss when nothing else worked. Doesn't it make sense that the same chemicals used to slow down the metabolism of the animals we use for our food sources can slow down our metabolism as well?She gives us alternatives to the chemical laden food we are used to consuming on traditional ""diets"" and offers a life-long alternative...reduce chemical calories and enjoy food once again. Along with proper supplementation, you can be healthy and slimmer, restoring your metabolism to its normal rate."
4,Contains a lot of useful information about how pesticides cause obesity,"I found this book to be a mixed bag with some stellar writing on how pesticides cause weight gain, the pesticide content of foods and useful supplements for detoxification. Things I didn't like were:*A glaring contradiction that in the beginning of the book Dr. Braille-Hamilton notes that calorie reduction diets don't work because they slow metabolism yet the bulk of her eating plan is a calorie reduction diet.*Recommendations for expensive Shaklee vitamins and supplements. This included a dubious homeopathic supplement.*Recommendations for unnecessary amino acids to help detoxification.So in the final analysis it is a great book about pesticides and recommendations on how to get them out of your food. On the other hand I doubt that this is a very effective weight loss plan."
2,mas o menos,"Despues de leer todo el libro, que es bastante largo, no encontre una manera practica de aplicarlo. Son mejores los de Jillian Michaels en mi opinion."
1,mouse didnt even work ..,they sent me a defective mouse i was going to send it back but it would cost me more to send back than i payed for it so just be aware
1,Pure Crap,I have never in all my shopping even seen such cheap and poorly made crap sell for this price. I was lucky to get this item on sale and still it's not worth the 4 dollars i paid.This hovercarft is crap the lights work as it states but that's all it does.It's suppose to zoom on a cushion of air this thing won't even float it does nothing but light up and there is a light gust of air it's as light as a sheet of paper.I replaced the batteries and it still didn't float or zoom.DON'T waste your hard earn money on this crap.
1,Garbage...,"I had added this to my cart, out of curiosity. At the time, there were no reviews and no item description, so for $3 and change, I used it as a filler to get free shipping. This ""toy"" is useless and just as bad as the first reviewer says. It barely hovers and is poorly made. Save your money..."
1,A dissapointment to Lorenzo Lamas fans!,"This movie only had 2 offical fight scenes! And there were some additional ""fight scenes"" where Lorenzo gets jumped, and one where he goes into this guys night club and beats up a few men. Not incredibly bad storyline, but almost no fighting! Lorenzo doesn't even do his jumping pump roundhouse (a move which he is most notable using in his TV show Renegade). The movie came out one year before his show started, so I guess he was desperate for a role, so he didn't mind starring in this film. Lorenzo plays Miles Keane, a night club owner and photographer. He payed off his loan to the guy who gave it to him by fighting for him. His employer wants him to fight again, he refuses, and then gets framed for murder. Lorenzo has to fight again to save his mom and his girlfriend. This movie only gets one star because Lorenzo Lamas is in it."
2,"Pretty, but very heavy.","Bought them for my mom because she liked the picture. Too heavy to wear for long, but very shiny. She likes them."
1,Stan & Ollie DESERVE MORE THAN THIS!!!,Avoid this cheapo release of these great film! subpar prints..certainly NOT from original 35mm elements..wait for the good one to come out down the road!
3,"Great,but could've been better!!","Listen,I'm a BIG Laurel and Hardy fan and when I first saw that there was going to be box set of the best comedy team ever,I was excited,but I just found out that there are no shorts!! There's no Berth Marks,Hoose-gow,Chickens Come Home,Music Box,County Hospital,Scram!;none of those classic shorts...I mean,the first 3 discs are already out on DVD..Utopia isn't the best of the 3,but there are funny moments in it..The other 2 are alot better.""Lucky Dog"" is already available on the slient shorts collection that Hal Roach Studios came out a few years ago...Why couldn't this collection be like the Buster Keaton box set that Kino on Video put out not too long ago?? Laurel and Hardy fans deserve better than this!!!"
3,Missing important films!,How complete a collection of their classics could this be without their masterpiece WAY OUT WEST??? I am constantly amazed that this film is still not available on DVD! Does anyone know why?
2,CHEESY COLLECTION,"No offence,but I couldn't agree more with most everyone else who's rated this collection.It just isn't right without Sons Of The Desert,Way Out West,The Music Box and Another Fine Mess.For me the best films in this DVD set would be March Of The Wooden Soldiers,Be Big and The Lucky Dog.The latter being a collector's item going by how it was Stan and Ollie's very first film together,even before they became the famous comedy duo.Utopia would be another collector's item,being their very last film from 1950.I hadn't realised they were around that long.However,their appearance in this film is an eyesore,with Stan so thin and sick looking and Ollie three hundred pounds overweight.One thing you may notice,is the film's remarkable simularity to Gilligan's Island."
2,No Commentary,"When I add a DVD to my humble collection, I expect to learn something historical about the making of the film. If you want to see a great commentary which all DVD makers should emulate, it is ''Love is a Many- Splendered Thing' with William Holden & Jennifer Jones.When I turned on my player expecting to learn a bit more about my two heros and discovered no running commentary and the voices out of sync, I was very disappointed.Much aloha,Bill"
1,Has one heck of an annoying buzzing sound.,"This phone just can't seem to be in the same room with anything electronic. I had bought it for my bedroom and it seemed to work fine for a short while and then the buzzing sound started. I wasn't sure why at first and then I tried moving around and noticed that the buzzing sound lowered as I moved it away from any electronics. Well, that won't do for me because I want it on my night stand along with my lamp and my clock radio. I should have sent it back but I just gave it to my kid to play with. I have since bought a nice new cordless phone of another brand that works great!"
5,Truly the best bread cookbook,"When I wanted to expand my reach to include baking the bread that I serve, this book was suggested to me by a pastry chef friend, as the one that he had used in his kitchen. Truly a great book with the science and back ground that is needed to make profession quality breads. Sponge starter, dry starter and quick breads are all covered in great detail. I have used it over and over again, and also used it as a jumping off point to experiment on my own."
4,add to the library,If your looking for more bread recipies for you home here is a book you should look into. It has great recipies and awesome instruction on cooking them aswell.
2,very disappointing,Had used Nancy Silverton's La brea Bakery bread book for a long time and loved it. Decided to try another bread book and was extremely dissapointed in this one. The sourdough bread I made had to be thrown out. The french bread recipes are just okay.
1,An exercise in perfection,"Purchased book for my wife, the following is written by her;I have been baking breads for 10 years. Many of them very well. This book has me totally overwhelmed. It actually expects the baker to check the temperature of the dough as it is kneaded. I'm sure the book is great for a professional baker, but not for the average cook."
2,Crust & Crumb,I prefer all cookbooks with lots of pictures so I can see what the finished product should look like. I hate guessing. Not to crazy about this one. I love to bake bread and am always looking for new methods and recipes. I will share this one with my daughter who is an accomplished bread baker and see what she thinks about it.
1,Not worth the money,"If you want to spend 2 weeks and end up with bread that you wouldn't feed a dog, follow the barm sponge or yeasted rye recipes from this book."
3,good book,"the only thing i think its missing are more pictures of the finished products... maybe its because i bought the bread bakers apprentice first, and pictures DO make a huge difference...."
1,Crust and Crumble,"Just not practical for the everyday home-baker. I am serious about baking and breadmaking, and have been very successful doing so. These Formulas are difficult to follow and usually take two to three days to make (Some even 5 days). The reality of this book is...it is more like a text book for a culinary school student not for a weekend baker. If you want some great bread baking recipes (all kinds like this book provides), invest in the Joy of Cooking. You'll get some great other recipes as well and EVERYBODY can enjoy making them. Hope this helped."
2,Dunno...,"The recipes in this book are harder, more time consuming, etc... than standard bread making and more so than those in his ""everyday"" book. It has a really, very good buttermilk pancake recipe, but the rest that I've tried turned out difficult and didn't come out very nice. Maybe my fault, and I'm not giving up, but it's certainly not one for the faint of heart."
5,One can't go wrong with Peter Reinhart,"I have all of Peter Reinhart's books and have used every one and have yet to find fault with any.I have been baking bread for the greater part of my 70 years but I find there are still new things for me to learn. I appreciate the time and effort that has gone into all of the bread books by this author so he can offer a product that is easy to interpret and for anyone to use as long as they pay attention.This is not a quickie book for the casual baker and there are plenty of short-cut recipe books for them. However if one is a hobby baker who wants to perfect technique and have a nearly professional end product, this is the book to buy."
5,excellent,This work was eight years in the making and is truly a delight to own. I just purchased it and am very pleased with it. It is the counterpart to to Colin Brown's New Testament Dictionary in 4 volumes.
5,Amazing music,"This CD keeps up with the excellent quality you can expect from Jon Schmidt. He always keeps it entertaining, relaxing, and gorgeous. He is extremely talented and I have never been disappointed by any of his CD's I have bought."
5,The Best Music on the Planet,"Jon Schmidt's music has changed my life. I am glad I have been able to be a part of the talent he gives. This album is absolutely uplifting and very much worth the price. If you ever get a chance, please take the small effort to attend a concert or visit his online page at http://www.jonschmidt.com. I'm a happy supporter of this man and his talents."
5,glass cleaner,"I have used this product for many years and am totally satisfied with its results. Though the ownership has changed, the product is still good."
3,CLEARVIEW,TURTLE WAX T420B CLEARVIEW PROFESSIONAL GLASS CLEARNER. THE ACTIVE INGREADIENT SEEMS TO BE VOLITAL. YOU CAN SMELL IT WHEN SPRAYED ON A PAPER TOWEL. IT WORKS WELL ON THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. BUT HAVE GOOD VENTILATION. THE FLAMABILITY MUST BE FROM ACUMULATED FUMES.PEP BOYS CARRY IT FOR AROUND $3.50. I COULD NOT FIND IT IN OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS.
1,Not happy,"Does not clean any better than Windex or the ones you buy at the grocery. Just go to the store, you don't need to order and pay postage."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"This glass cleaner is the worst product ever created. It leaves streaks the size of Dallas all over the windows, and when you try to wipe them away, it just creates more. I had to re-wash my car just to get them to go away. I could get better results with a homeless dude, his spit, and a newspaper. Don't ever buy this because you will have a stroke from rage. I hate this product."
3,"Buy season 1 instead, it is a better buy!","Get more for your money, you can get these four episodes PLUS 10 more for just a few dollars more in the ""WHAT'S NEW SCOOBY DOO SEASON 1"" set!2002Sep.14 There's No Creature Like Snow CreatureSep.21 3-D StructionSep.28 Space Ape at the CapeOct.05 Big Scare in the Big Easy"
5,second best volume,I am going to tell you the episodes on this set1. Theres no creature like snow creature (A-)2. Space ape at the cape (A+)3. 3d struction (A-)4. Big scare in the big easy (A+)Enjoy this set
4,Being a Huge S.D fan,"I was more than happy when i saw that they had a new updated version of Scooby Doo out there. I know its not the original, but it really cant be. Its something i watched when i was kid and love still do til this day. But i actually do enjoy this new updated version of Scooby Doo. If you have any love for Scooby Doo, you would do well check this one out. I know that there are many changes and such to it. But you still have the whole Mystery Inc gang there and they are still doing their thing. Solving crimes, busting up bad guys and still getting called those ""meddling kids"" by folks busted in the act. Plus there are 4 episodes of the show the disc as well as the other volumes of What's New Scooby Doo. Not a bad price at all, you might be able to find it cheaper. But no big deal, in ending the new Scooby Doo is more than enough to satisfy my praise for the first.Plus the Mystery Machine is still taking the gang wherever they wanna go."
2,Not the greatest quality,Answering machine voice quality poor; handset soon shorted out from static electricity; no hang-up feature from handset. I don't recommend this one.
2,Poor quality phone,"Wall-mounting is difficult, the sound quality of the answering machine is poor, and the answering machine circuitry fried before one year of use."
3,Good but with Significant Gaps,"Jerry L. Campbell's ""FW 190 in Action"" has strong coverage of the BMW 801-powered Fw 190A, F, and G models but oddly does not cover the DB 603-powered B and C, Jumo 213-powered D, or Ta 152 models. For those models covered, there is a strong attention to detail with emphasis on the A-1 through A-8 models, including technical differences and brief operational history. The book is loaded with photographs, two three-view line drawings, a page of color paintings, and illustrations. Strangely, technical specifications are lacking as dimensions and weights are listed but performance data is completely absent. Overall, this is not a bad source for info on early versions of one of the Luftwaffe's top fighters but for the complete story one must look elsewhere."
2,Not impressed,"The first thing about the book is that it is out of date. I usually love older books for the information, but this book was a huge disappointment. I guess I expected to find something that I as a common person, does not already know. Not that I am really smart, this is just old news, I wanted something fresh and new."
1,Couldn't get through it...,"I just never really could ""get into"" this book. It doesn't ""read well"" - explanations were cumbersome and borderline boring. The author tells us quite a bit about how the world we live in is not healthy for us - perhaps true; but I am not yet willing to live in a bubble to stay healthy...While I expected more information regarding muscle testing for body weaknesses and determining alternative health needs, the author focuses more on proving what substances are bad for us - white sugar, auto exhaust, flourescent lighting, synthetic clothing materials, the list goes on..."
3,Your Body Doesn't Lie,"I did not read the whole book. I just skimmed through it because I purchased it for someone else. However, what I did read was very informative so I would recommend it to anyone interested in their health."
4,Your Body Doesn't Lie,"I had heard a lot about muscle testing before reading this book, but the concept didn't make sense to me. I knew people who could very effectively do muscle testing, but I could not learn it. This book helped me understand what it is, why it could work, and how I could begin to practice if I wanted to learn it. If you want to know more about muscle testing, this book is a good beginning."
4,Fascinating Read,"This book is a fascinating read and full of useful information. It is a short book and I wanted to understand how the body ""talks""."
5,Practical Self-Care Help,"The difficult thing about this book is that the ideas have what, to some, may seem too esoteric a basis. However, if you make a list of all of the suggested self-care activities and put them into practice, you will soon be able to determine if the ideas will work for you or not. Personally, I feel a big difference in my mental state at work since I started implementing the practices - a book for those wanting to reach a new level of well-being, awareness and consciousness."
5,Practical and inspiring - essential!,"I first read this book in the early 1980s, and I have referred to it ever since for its highly practical suggestions on ways to reduce stress and enhance creativity. I have also used Diamond's discussion of ""Stress and Cerebral Balance"" as a text in teaching communication in college courses. While I understand that the use of kinesiological testing by those not professionally trained has turned out to be a more difficult and complex matter than suggested in this early work, the results of Dr. John Diamond's research are as relevant today as they were when this book was first published in 1979. This book truly laid the groundwork for Dr. Diamond's wonderful subsequent writings, which have developed and refined his work. And here, as always, Dr. Diamond's prose is wonderful reading -- robust, down-to-earth, and entertaining!"
2,Versions of ABC Weekend Special's Haunted Mansion Mystery,"This is one great video if you remember the old ABC Saturday Morning Weekend Specials from the 80's, but there are to different versions available. The first one that I purchased was at a Wal-Mart and it starts exactly like the old series did with the Weekend Special song and hosts. Then I purchased another one through Amazon so that I would have a back-up copy if mine ever bit the dust. This copy had a white sticker label on the front of the tape, the other one didn't. And although it said Anchor Bay on the box as the manufacturer, when I played the tape it said Video Treasures and went straight into the show with no song and had bad tape quality that would not straighten out. I am a huge fan of the series and urge anyone who are ABC Weekend Special purists to ask before buying."
2,Decent overview,This is a very general guide to neighborhoods in and around Manhattan. The descriptions are fairly good you'll need to do a lot more research once you;ve found an area that looks good. This book is probably best for those who know little about living in NY.
5,Wonderful glimpse into the past,"I'm a history major, and Century of War was recommended to me by one of my professors during a discussion. As both a person with a strong interest in history and the granddaughter of an American WWII veteran, Century of War--and, in particular, the WWII footage--was an amazing and heart-wrenching watch. Watching this footage is a much more terrific experience than simply reading about these events in a textbook, and it really gives you a feeling for what it was like. These videos really gave me a new perspective on historical events that I was already familiar with, and were very informative as well. I would definitely recommend this set for anyone with an interest in history, and I think that even those without an interest could gain one by watching this."
5,I Really Enjoyed This Box Set!,"I'm a history buff and I often enjoy watching films about the various conflicts that have taken place throughout America's history.The set came with a total of 24 DVDs which cover WWI, WWII, The Korean War, The Cold War and the Vietnam conflict.The video footage was often rare combat footage that you won't find in any other set, as well as behind-the-scenes stuff that took place on the front lines.Great box set! I give it a full 5 stars!"
3,Mahjongg Vol.2,"Product is just what is said it was. Was not as good as the first volume (Mahjongg) program, but it works."
4,Snowy goodness,"People rode snowboards, it was fun to watch. Some really great tricks. How much more can you say about a snowboarding video?"
4,I love my little printer,"I got the Olympus P-10 Printer from my Bro-In-Law on a trade. It was brand new in the box. I love it. I am fairly picky about print quality, but not a snob - so I would be able to recommend this printer to just about anyone. I love the fact that it is portable, we can take it to the Grandparents, take pics of the kid, and print them out on the spot. I like that there is no ink to dry out, no print heads to clog, and the little box looks pretty cool. So far, it has been trouble free."
5,Good value supplies,"The price was great for this paper and ribbon pack, but it's the P10 printer that really rocks. Absolutely great photo printer for the price. I have done well over 200 prints and it is perfect. It is used with 4 Macs over my home wireless network, hanging off an Apple Airport Express in my living room."
1,Hot from the printer photos,I am sold to this printer paper from Olympus. I have the printer and I bring it to parties and print the photos I take there so that everyone can enjoy seeing themselves right away. It brings so much fun to everyone and I get a lot of compliments and 'Thank you's'.
4,Olympus P-P100 Paper for P-10 Printer,Excellent product for occaisional printing. Too costly for high volume printing.
3,Interesting...but...,"The story was interesting, it kept you reading and wondering what was going to become of everyone. Which leads into, WHAT did happen to everyone? It really never goes into deep details. This was disapointing and left you wanting to know what happened to the Author, how she dealt with her Mom's passing, where she is now, how she's doing, how her Father is, etc...I do feel for the Author, she had a tough childhood and seems to have become a stronger person, yet a lost sadness lays below the surface."
2,Tedious,"A recounting of incidents in the life of a teen whose brother was killed in a car accident remembered in a frequently tedious, minute-by-minute style (""I bit the apple, I wiped the juice from my chin, I bit again"" to paraphrase one example, of which there are many. These incidents, many of which seem to go nowhere, were not so fascinating to me. Also, I found the author to be transparently attention-seeking in a bratty and annoying way, and the least sympathetic character in the book."
4,A coming of age story with a twist of grief and loss,"I enjoyed this book. It's slow but not plodding. Alison, the main character, is a teenage girl who lives with and through the sudden death of her 18 year old brother, but the book is so much more. Her relationships with family & friends is what is so interesting. No clean-cut endings here............."
2,"Snoozer - Author is a writer, not a reader",The story is compelling - maybe - didn't make it to the end. But the story telling is sleep inducing. I literally had to switch from it to top 40 radio to stay awake on the drive home. The author sounds like a nice lady but the pacing and whispery tone make it very difficult to listen without feeling drowsy. Perhaps she should have been a hypnotist. I might try the written version to see if the pacing goes better with that format.
3,"mixed subjects, mixed quality","Alison Smith has the ability to capture grief, to dwell on it, and sometimes to exorcise it. This memoir is suffused in sadness for a lost brother. It is a eulogy: at times poignant, at times indulgent.Smith has some breath taking, magical passages that transport me. She also falls prey to lazy (if not also redundant) language (""placid calm"", ""brief moment""), and overuses pet words (slumped, hover, hoist, very, etc).Some of the writing is precise and conjures memories of dogs, backyards, childhood forts, parents who cannot comprehend their children. One of her finest scenes involves Jesus meeting Alison, though barely saying a word, and unable to help her.Yet her focus meanders. What begins as a celebration of her lost brother drifts into her growing up Catholic and lesbian. Are these connected? While Smith is effective at evoking the shifting moods of teenagers, her alarm at her own sexuality (""Oh no, I guess I like girls"") seems stilted or quaint."
3,not my cup of tea,"i did make it all the way through this book, which is saying something. she is a good writer, but i just didn't think she had much of a story to tell. losing a brother in an accident, living with anorexia, and experimenting with forbidden love...those things happen every day. i don't think i'd recommend this to someone looking for an interesting book.for a good memoir about an extraordinary childhood...try ""Sickened."""
3,LIFE RUINED BY A TRAGEDY,"Don't know where the author got the title of this book as it has nothing to do with the content. An animal is a very minor part. This memoir is primarily about a young girl up to college years and you discover: 1) she is close to her brother, 2) she is deeply, deeply Catholic and her family's life revolves around that fact, and 3) she is a budding lesbian. Her brother is killed in an accident at a young age and she is so devistated that it ruins her life and she is unable to overcome the shock all during the book. That burden becomes tedious at times. She has many friends and teachers that give her special consideration and attention, but it does not help her at all. The interaction of all people in this story is interesting, but it was a little too much for me."
3,"A quick, but typical read","I read this book in one sitting. It went by very quick and always kept your interest. However - there was nothing to learn here about how to deal with the death of a loved one. I have also had a brother die, and could have written a better book than this. There is also a lot of talk about the Catholic religion in here. If you are offended by religious reference, I would skip this one. I really felt for the author and her family, but again, this was not a remarkable book. The writing was okay. I do wish she would have gotten into more detail about her adult life. The only part of her life she discusses is the three years follwing her brother's passing."
4,A compelling story,"Alison Smith and her brother, Roy, were as close as siblings can be when they were children. Suddenly, at eighteen, Roy is killed in a terrible automobile accident. His loss to the family is like an enormous black hole, sucking all the other members of the family into never-never land.This is the first book I've received from a book publisher and I was terrified I would hate it and have to pan it. (sigh of relief) Not a chance here. Alison Smith is an excellent storyteller, with a perfect sense of where to start and where to stop and what details to include. In addition, Smith has a compelling story to tell. Recommended."
5,A Memorable Memoir,"This is a really good read and for a memoir, it reads remarkably like a novel. Whereas many memoirs have an inherent sense of distance in relaying the events and experiences of the author's past, this one has a real (almost startlingly so!) sense of immediacy. There are very few sentences that relay anything that mentions the future - no real hints as to how it all ""turned out."" Smith is a very talented writer and I would read just about anything else that she wrote! I definitely plan on keeping an eye out for other books in the future. It's an impressive book - very emotional, quite well done and altogether excellent."
4,Looks and sounds great. Feels like a Conair.,"We have a 1941 house in California complete with a little phone shrine in the kitchen, and nothing but an old fashioned phone could live up to the special little nook. For $19.99 (at an electronics store) I have the look. And the sound. It sounds like a dramatic phone ring in an old movie. The only thing it doesn't have is that twenty pound heft I associate with real old phones. Looks and sounds old, but feels like a Conair."
3,Nice Design / Painful Handset,"Anyway, when I saw this, it really caught my eye. It has a classic design. The price wasn't bad either. The push buttons with the rotary style is a nice detail. One drawback is that the receiver is very heavy. The shape of the receiver makes it difficult to put the phone on your shoulder to talk hands-free. I did that on the receiver slipped, hitting me in the lip and teeth. OUCH!"
3,An interesting read.,"Like a few others I was there when Hee Haw first hit the airwaves way back in 1969, and like a lot of viewers I thought it was a lot more energetic and entertaining than some of the other drivel offered on prime time.I thought the girls were pretty, the gags corny, and the music so-so (I've never been a huge country-music fan, but can appreciate a good tune all the same). Years later I heard about the rumors and tell all scandals of some of the cast members, but really had no particular interest in who broke what law and was brought up on what morals charge while staring on the show.But, I was interested in the actual production itself. Therefore when this book came around, I took a chance on it.It was okay for what it was, but I feel it could've been better. Lots of pictures, some interesting anecdotes, give it a read."
2,Inaccuracies & Misinformation,"I read the book, very little about Jeannine Riley of Petticoat Junction. And while we are on the topic of Petticoat Junction, this is the show that also starred Gunilla Hutton, not Green Acres as you stated in your book. Sorry."
1,Not enough dirt.,Lovullo tries to be as nice as he can to everyone that worked at the show. I expected to read more about the stars and their lives. Almost half of the book is a videography of each episode!
1,Total Waste of Money,"Unless you happen to have a typewriter, photocopier, and lots of free time on your hands, I'd advise against purchasing this. As it ""conveniently"" said inside the book, so that one could recognize having wasted one's money, the will kit is available on a CD for $12.95 (Amazon doesn't offer this; at least, it didn't show up in my search results). In short, spending more money in order to transcribe the book contents onto a computer doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense."
4,Comments of a Rorem fan.,I am an unabashed Rorem fan. May he live forever and keep on composing. This particualr cd also benefits by the performers. And the texts set are so varied and diverse that it makes me enjoy once again the setting of poetry by a modern musician.
5,Compulsory reading in this mad world,I picked it up and started reading it in a cab. 5 minutes later the driver asked me to get out. I was in fits of uncontrolled laughter!
5,High quality,"This seems to be a really high quality rolling pin. I ordered it from amazon about a year ago and it has worked out great. Granted, I don't bake A LOT, but enough that I have used it several times and had a good experience. The packaging from amazon was also great, so no problems with the shipping. Definitely recommend to others"
3,AVERAGE BAND,"this average band was led by guitarrist Vic Malcolm and released three albuns in sucession, between 1974 and 1976. THis one here is the second of them. AC/DC's singer Brian Johnson was their vocalistand I can guarantee you, folks, he was much better than nowadays, when he seems to have lost his voice completely. as for the music, nothing more than average hard rocking, well played but with nothing innovative going on, no big moment."
1,Cheap and rough,"My husband and I have been looking for an additional small wooden spoon to use in the kitchen. Small ones are hard to find. He ordered this one and has used it a couple of times. I picked it up to put it away out of the drainer and was shocked to see that it was rougher than the one we've been using for years. It looks like this was never ever sanded. The wood seems very porous - not a good thing for a wooden spoon that you are using in food, as it can hide food in the crevices that can encourage bacterial growth over the long haul. I'm surprised that he's not getting chunks of wood in his oatmeal in the morning.It's not worth returning. I may take some sandpaper to it though. I've seen better spoons in garage sales than this one."
1,Not what I ordered!,I ordered Cockatiel food (Medium Birds). The package came and on it it states that it is for cockatiels but the pellets are for medium/large birds. The pellets are to big. The package is missleading. I an trying to figure out how to contact the seller to get a refund.
1,It does not smell like it should !!,"At first, it did not smell like I remembered it to do. Went to a Duty free store and try the original and it is completely different smell that the one I purchased.Will not return cause I have used it already, but it seems to be fake! !"
5,Best Price ever for my favorite Cologne,"This is the best price I have ever paid for Obsession for Men, except the PX, Military store, and then it was the same price-2 years ago!! I was worried about this being a knock-off imposter, it showed up in perfect condition, smelled perfect, brand new in the box and sealed in the factory wrapper, I still had some of my last bottle to compare it to. Unless you are friends with Calvin Klein this is the best deal going, order it from home or anywhere, shipped to you in a couple days, I did!!---Frank"
5,Womens favorate,YES INDEED THIS IS THE BEST CLASSIC SCENT OUT THERE IF YOU WANT TO GET NOTICED THEN BUY THIS ONE.
3,Automotive service inspection maintenance repair,"The book appears to indeed make a valiant attempt at explaining topics of automotive service. Unfortunately, in some cases it lacks real practicality when it comes to using the information in reality. Not enough information is available in some cases to really service your vehicle safely. It does cover a huge range of topics, which is really good, but I dont think a 30 word paragraph can really help someone properly repair or troubleshoot a component in a motor vehicle. The book is worth it (US$15) in the context of beginner training, but should not be bought for executing actual repairs, like what I did. That was a huge disappointment. This book also has a LOT of wonderful pictures and illustrations, which is indeed helpful. The author should NEVER have used some of the over-simplified illustrations, they only serve to confuse the issue. A beginner is likely to think the what they see in the book is exactly what is, in reality."
5,A must read!,"This book is a collection of fond memories, hindsight perspectives and intimate behind-the-scenes tales from the Dodgers' dugout during the late 1950s and early 1960s.Paul Gutierrez is a great writer and seasoned reporter!This book is a quick read (even for non-sports fans) and very much detail-oriented (that Gutierrez definitely put time and effort into this book).I read this book over the course of a week and enjoyed it so much I almost felt compelled to write the author (LOL).Recommended."
5,Ms. Sophie does it again.,This is the fourth single to be released by Ms. Bextor and it continues her growth as an artist. She has a rich smokey type voice that makes sound very smart and her songs do show off her excellent songwriting ability to great affect. This track hit #3 on the uk charts and features the single mix and the Max Reich vocal mix(7:50) of the title track. I bought cd 2 from amazon.co.uk the first week it was released and have played the remix non stop. The remix is more agressive house in sound than her previous retro/disco feel of her past 3 releases. You also get 3 postcards of the beautiful Sophie to keep or to send to someone(I'm keeping mine). Excellent song and remix from an artist who I hope will eventually be released in the US.Enjoy the voice.
3,VERY expensive,"Found this product after I bought it at a local auto parts store for less than half the price paid on line. The review has to do with price paid, not product performance. All reviews indicate the product works as advertised."
5,Engineered!,"Top notch design. Ergonomic design holds pliers on pipe if you release them, and directional jaws provide the phenomenal gripping power of a pipe wrench. Easy cam adjustment which locks in place, better than tongue and grooves, like channel locks. Worth the money, but save it and get the Cobra pliers by Knipex."
1,Not worth the money.,I took a chance on purchasing it online because it was Bison meat. My dad isn't picky when it comes to any type of meat or cheese but let's just say there's still left overs in our fridge from last Christmas. You're better of test tasting at a local shop. Definitely not worth the money.
2,Looked used,The product arrived in the original packaged but it was all taped up like it had been used and looked very old. Not sure why it wasn't advertised as used if it was going to come looking so horrible. Still have to determine if it will work
2,What happened to a regular old-fashioned typewriter?,"This item is listed as a typewriter, but it is another electronic ""wonder"". It is very complicated and difficult to use. Every process involves a code. There is little manual control. It is most difficult to figure out where you are ""typing"". Filling in applications and such is a trial and error process. I am struggling with it, for sure, and disappointed. I would much prefer to be using my old Smith-Corona typewriter if I could only find a ribbon and correction tape."
2,Bad piece of machinery,"We had troubles fromt he start, they correct a type would not work. Took to a Brothers repair shop and they could not fix, need some parts.. plus when you tried to type letters you would get numbers... It was the present my daughter wanted the most for christmas and she could not use... very sad. So I will by another brand at a local store in town."
1,not reliable for very long,"Just a little under six weeks and it no longer prints properly. Its as if the hammer that drives the arms for the letters hits when it feels like it and sometimes it is on a wrong key from the one that was touched. So, actually, I am disappointed with this machine. I now have to waste my time in trying to find a repair shop for this and I am afraid the cost will be more than the cost of the machine.....so.....I think that if I would have spent more bucks and perhaps a better name brand I would have been much happier. Anyway, thats that!!!!"
4,Good typewriter,Typewriters are hard to find. For me it is a small supplement to my computer word processing. Nothing works better at filling out forms than a good typewriter.
5,A great typewriter,"I received this for a gift and am extremely happy with it. I love to write short stories but often have writer's block, so I'm excited to have a new format. The best part about this typewriter is that even though it's electronic, it still makes the familiar old ""clacking"" sound as you type, and has the familiar typewriter font--really sets the mood for creative writing. I wouldn't have expected a typewriter to have spell-check, but this one does--it makes a little dinging sound if you spell a word incorrectly, and gives you the ability to erase one letter, the word, or an entire line with the (included and already installed) correction tape. You can adjust the positioning of the paper yourself with the knob on the side, which would be helpful when filling out forms. Includes a keyboard cover to keep dust out of the keys, and a carrying handle. Overall, the typewriter is easy to set up and use."
1,Poor Qualityship and Design of this Product.,The design and quality workmanship of this product leaves a lot to be desired. The correction tape mechanism is far too complicated and almost impossible to replace. The first time the correction ribbon was replace it had to be taken in for service where a defective part was found and since the time span was 95 days there was no coverage for labor. Recently a second correction ribbon needed to be replaced and the same problem. The technical support person said the typewriter had to be taken in for service again - again without coverage for labor cost. The cost to replace the correction tapes has already exceeded the original cost of this product in a time period of six months - so this typewriter will be thrown on the heap scrap pile and replaced with a non-Brother brand named typewriter.
1,plastic junk,"purchased this item in Jan of 2012. used infrequently. after about 10 hours of use it just quit. 90 day warranty useless, this fee and that fee and shipping and return shipping, 1 year warranty useless. just so much junk for $100..... buy elsewhere. i will never use this manufacturer again. not Amazon's fault but maybe the should screen their vendors a little more closely"
4,Brother Typewriter,Bought this for my daughter (9) as a Christmas gift. She fell in love with it. Very easy to use and works perfect!!!!
2,Keep shopping,"This typewrtiter is used in a legal office and for the small amount it is used we fight it almost every time we use it. Towards the bottom of a document it doesn't hold the paper, it is a cheap quality and very hard to line up a straigt line. It is basic and offers great simple features but the quality of printing is inferior to our expectations. At times it prints the wrong letters, beeps frequently for unkown reasons. There is always something going wrong."
1,total loss,"after unpacking the item would not set up. It would not operate. Unpacking instructions were followed with great care. Set-up instructions were followed with great care. The support unit of Brother was telephoned in accordance with instructions and I was instructed to take the typewriter to the nearest authorized repair center - a mere 49 miles away, I was informed. 49 miles if I had a helicopter, that is, the actual drive was 90 minutes and 75 miles away. The repair center informed me that (a) they would need to order parts and (b) would also charge at least $50 for labor. The fine print: the warranty provided by Brother only covered labor for 90 (count 'em) 90 days, an excellent gauge of the confidence of Brother in their product. This typewriter is now scrap metal, and in my estimation was scrap metal when purchased. Brother cannot be proud of this product and if it is not already out of production, should be cancelled immediately. Shame, shame, shame on Brother"
3,"Works OK, but wish it had Caps Lock","I bought this typewriter to replace an old Brother AX-25, which we used in our business for addressing envelopes and packages. It works fine, but is a somewhat stripped-down version of the older machine. My greatest disappointment is the lack of a Caps Lock key. The Postal Service prefers addresses in all caps, so we run the typewriter on that setting most of the time. But this one has only a Shift Lock, which requires you take it off every time you type a number, or you'll get #^%$^ instead, then put it back on to type letters. It has a platen turn knob on the left only. Even my 1923 Remington Model 12 had one on each side--but that's a minor inconvenience compared to the lack of a Caps lock key. It has lots of electronic bells and whistles which we never use, but they may be useful to some."
1,Garbage,"This typewriter is an unbelievable piece of junk. Garbage. Don't buy it - even if they offer it to you for free. There's not enough room here to list the problems - just skip it. Do yourself a favor, and stay away from Brother. I've had nothing but problems with their fax machines and printers as well. Don't know how they stay in business."
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,Typewriter lasted only 2 1/2 months before malfunctioning. Characters typed does not correspond to what was printed on paper. Troubleshooting it at Brothers website did not help. Not worth wasting my time dealing with the warranty department.
2,ok but...,"This game was bought new.The Game freezes a lot during game play.although it is fun to play, I was never able to complete a season, I have created 3 seasons, not one was completed, at a certain point, while loading a game it would freeze and you would have to restart the console and just delete that season. even if you try to simulate that game, it will still remain frozen and your season is ruined."
2,Hard to use,"I really don't like this answering machine. Although technically it's done everything it says it would there is no digital number reading how many messages you have - you just have to count the number of times the tiny little green dot blinks. You also have to hit ""save"" during the middle of hearing your message. If you don't - that message is gone for good. It's also difficult to save just one message. The default setting is to save all of them. I'm going to look for something else."
1,a very bad little machine,"We tried two of these and neither worked correctly--kept cutting callers off, sometimes would erase the outgoing message, and outgoing message quality was poor. Could not get it to delete or save individual messages. So frustrating."
1,you will read this post if you are smart,this book didn't show me how to market my beats. instead it was a 13 minute tutorial paying some money to sonic producer to sign up for their services to make beats online. REFUND PLEASE
2,An American Christmas,"I believed I was getting Christmas music played by a harp and this came out entirely different. Iraed it and asked for harp music, but it isn't."
2,Works well but not a long-life phone,"I bought this same model phone just in a different color about 13 months ago. The phone worked fine, it had clear sound, the battery would stay charged even when off the base for over a day, and the lighted keypad was a great function for finding the phone fast when it's not on the base. I've unfortunately had to replace this phone recently because the keypad has stopped working. You need to press down extrordinarily hard to get the buttons to respond and then it dials the number twice. This made it impossible to dial numbers that have an automated menu, and also just plain annoying to dial any number. It's not an expensive phone, but it's really not worth the price for only one year of use."
1,Great feature Poor sound,Loved all the features -- Mute and Hold on the base and the handset. Speaker phone worked great... BUT the quality of the headset made my cellular phone seem great. Lots of clicking noises and short range for a 2.4GH phone. Has to go back...
1,Not At All Happy!,I had a 7 year old cordless phone that had PERFECT reception (it was a panasonic) but unfortunately the buttons went on it so we decided to replace it with this phone. I wish I had never done that because the reception is so horrible in our very small apt. that I can't believe it. All we hear are clicks and static whenever we leave the room where the phone base is. (AGAIN- reception was perfect with our supposedly out of date phone). I am so very disappointed and annoyed!
3,microwaves and phone do not mix!,This phone has great features but 2 major problems. The reception when you are walking just a few steps away from the base is terrible. I can not use it upstairs or in my basement. Also you can not use a microwave while trying to hold a conversation. The sound is so bad I have to switch to anther phone. I thought it was just my microwave but a friend has the same phone without the answering machine and she has the same problem. They just bought a Vtech and love it.
3,Oh Well!,"I bought this phone because I love features and it does have that. However the voice instruction, the ringer and the overall feel to the phone stinks! It's fairly user friendly but just doesn't feel good. You can tell it's a brand that just doesn't get it! It's going back."
1,I hope it is faulty,I have had this phone for a week and it is unusable. A couple of times every phone call the handset emits a horrible parrot-like shriek and then changes channel. Half the time when I charge the handset it automatically goes on page and will not charge or reset. About 1 in 5 calls the handset will not dial the number entered and the only way to reset it is to place it back in the unit.I have to call GE but I don't even want a replacement.
1,Is there a -1 star rating?,"The GE phones are awful. The caller ID displays new calls in random order, all over the place with previously logged in calls. About a month out of warranty the base unit now has to be unplugged about once a week to reset normal functioning. GE customer service is of no help, basically statings &quot;This is the way the phone normally operates.&quot; Yeah, right... My gut reaction after trying the phone at home was to take it right back. I wish I had."
1,Awful!,"Bought this thinking I was purchasing a good product by a reputable company. Bad move! The handset constantly loses 'communication' with the base and the caller ID doesn't work consistently either. I went to bed last night with the handset fully charged and sitting on my nightstand. I woke up with nothing on the caller ID, the speaker button on the base lit up and the handset in use. To top it off, I had a new message from my friend on my answering machine! Huh!?!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"I am extremely dissapointed with this phone. The reception was awful and now, a little over a year later, it has completely died. The extended warranty has now expired and I am out $90.00. The reception/range was very poor even within my own home The battery would also hold a very limited charge. Save your money!"
1,Not worth the money,"Less than a year after purchasing this phone the speakphone does not work....which means the answering machine is useless. The sound is extreemly muffled and the volume constantly fluctuates. The handset also has sound issues. It is almost impossible to hear someone through the handset, even if the volume is all the way up."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"I bought this phone about 18 months ago, and have not been happy with it from the beginning. I thought I just needed to get &amp;quot;adjusted&amp;quot; to it...no!<br> NOW, the buttons are &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;......you have to pound on ALL of them to get them to work. I live alone, so it's not like there is a rough-and-tumble bunch of kids using it.<br> Also, the answering system is below quality, and when you are receiving another call, the call-waiting buzz/beep is WAY too long.<br> Overall, a very, very disappointing purchase. I am now in the process of looking for a replacement.<br> DON'T buy this phone"
1,Sent it in during warranty period--replacement [bad] too.,"We were looking to replace a clunky old Uniden model with something more contemporary-looking, and to be honest, we were pleased with almost everything about this phone--the styling, the size, the dialing, etc. But one of the most important things an answering machine has to do is PICK UP INCOMING CALLS. If your answering machine can't do that reliably, wouldn't you say you purchased a bum product? Well, about two weeks after buying this guy, co-workers started saying ""hey, don't you have an answering machine?"" and I knew we had a problem. Tested it and sure enough, it picked up only about 50% of the time. Our Uniden never had that problem. We sent it to GE and to their credit, got a replacement phone in about 2-3 weeks. Only problem is, the replacement they sent PICKS UP CALLS ONLY 50% OF THE TIME. Unbelievable. Never again."
1,One word: HIDEOUS,"I just bought this phone because my trusty 900 MHz Sony finally crapped out. This phone looked like a great deal in the store, but now I know why they were selling them so cheap!The range is pathetic. Sound quality goes down very quickly as you get away from the base. It reminds me of the very first cordless phones that you had to hold in just the right orientation in just the right place to get good reception.The LCD display is all but illegible. You have to look at the screen at some weird angle in order to increase the contrast to where you can read it. The time/date stamp is particular difficult to read.The botom line: my mom was right -- buy the best and only cry once."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"I bought this phone about 18 months ago, and have not been happy with it from the beginning. NOW, the buttons are broken......you have to pound on ALL of them to get them to work. I live alone, so it's not like there is a rough-and-tumble bunch of kids using it.Also, the answering system is below quality, and when you are receiving another call, the call-waiting buzz/beep is WAY too long.Overall, a very, very disappointing purchase. I am now in the process of looking for a replacement.DON'T buy this phone"
2,"Cheap, but short lifespan",Cons:After little over a year the '5' button on the keypad ceased functioning. We're not particularly heavy phone users and have never experienced anything like this before so it appears they just use cheap keypad switches. Receiver volume and answering machine sound quality are adequate at best.Pros:A lot of features at a moderate price.
3,Nice phone small buttons,"It has all the features I was looking for, caller ID, digital ans., cordless, dual keypad. I found the sound quality to be good, never had a problem, but then I don't walk down the street with my phone like some folks do. Its very convenient to have a keypad/speaker phone on the base in addition to having the handset. Comes in handy when you need to answer the phone and someone has walked away with the handset and left it in another room. Only drawback with this phone are the small, poorly labeled, badly located buttons on the base. The 2 main buttons I use on the base unit are the Play [messages] and Delete and on this phone they are the smallest of them all. The largest buttons are the caller ID scroll button, speakerphone, ""Hold"" (who ever uses that?) and caller ID ""Callback"". Dumb design."
1,TERRIBLE!,Please see my review on the phone-only version (no answering machine)of this phone. Worst phone I have ever owned.
1,Dont even bother!,"I'm on my second one already. The first one wouldnt even turn on with the talk button. ALL IT DID WAS BEEP SAYING IT WAS OUT OF RANGE, I WAS ONLY 2 FEET AWAY FROM THE BASE. So I bought another one thinking I just got a bad one. Well now it sometimes works, has tons of static unless I turn a certain way, and if I leave the room that has the base it cuts off. The features were nice but Im taking this one back before the warranty expires!"
1,Avoid this phone,"We took this phone back after two days. The handset is not comfortable and there is always a lot a clicking and static. I called many different people in different areas to try the phone out and they all said it sounded like I was talking through a tin can. Most of our conversations consisted of ""What?"" I can't tell you weather the features worked or not because I couldn't get past how horrible the handset and reception (both ways) were. A huge disappointment."
1,Not very happy,"I actually bought 2 of these phones, one with the answering machine as the main phone and then an extra one for the bedroom with only caller ID. I have a hard time with both of these phones cause of the buttons. They only work when they want to, for example if you are dialing out and attempt to presh the 4, it wont work until it feels like working (very frustrating when you are attempting to make a call). I know that it has to be a faulty part on GE's part because this has happened with both phones and I have heard of others with the same problem. So beware, you might end up like me, having to purchase new phones again in less than a year."
1,This phone is bad.... please avoid GE phones as they don't w,I had GE phone for 2 days and it stopped working.. Thank god it stopped working within the period I could return the phone. My sincere suggestion would be to avoid anything that has GE logo on it as their products are least reliable... Hope this helps
3,Not as good as we hoped,"This phone was recommended by Consumer Reports, and that's why we bought it. However, we're disappointed and plan to return it. The answerer is great. That much I will say, but the reception is terrible. Just walking around in the house we hear static and clicking noises. We also have had trouble with the Caller ID. It doesn't display all of the calls, and it doesn't display them in chronological order, which can be confusing. So, we're returning it and going to try something else."
5,Card holder,"Works great, neat and compact, a real eye catcher, I put four together and my customers use it a lot for services most tie into my business."
2,Good for the price but. . .,I've ordered nine of these so far and have received three of them broken. I don't know why since the they're carefully packaged. Maybe they were broken before they were packaged? I was able to glue them and with the cards in them you can't see the break.
5,Lovin' the deflecto 6 pocket,A perfect way to display business cards neatly. Much more professional than how we were doing it before. Easy install too.
5,HARD TO FIND,"I have an Air Machine which I purchased from a company a few years ago. The system is wonderful but the filters were impossible to get through the company I purchased it from. I looked on Amazon and there they were, thank you amazon for always filling in for the defunct and disorganized companies that turn the screws on consumers."
3,"Makes good points, but goes too far.","I'm open minded on the subject of eternal security. He makes some good points and it's a handy book to have most of the refuting scriptures about once saved, always saved, (osas).He clearly shows Dr. Stanley mishandling various scriptures. Stanley according to this book actually says Weeping and gnashing of teeth and being cast into outer darkness is really a place in heaven for the carnal christians. I haven't read Stanley's book but it appears he's quoting right from it. Despite these good points he makes, the author goes too far the other way into what may be called eternal insecurity. The best and most balanced book against eternal security I know of is If ye continue by Guy Duty. It's out of print but can be found sometimes at Amazon or other places."
1,"Devastating the Bible, Too?","This book may be a shocking expose of Charles Stanely only because Charles Stanley uses bad arguments for true doctrine. If someone chose bad arguments to prove the deity of Christ, that would not ""devastate"" the deity of Christ. Neither does this book ""devastate"" the doctrine of the security of God's saints--unless it devastates the Bible! ..."
1,God's Love is Greater Than You know,"I'm surprised that Daniel Corner would write something like this, after he did a fine job debunking KJV-Onlyism. I was sorely disappointed. Don't bother with this book...I would highly recommend anything written by Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum, of Ariel Ministries. He is consistent with his application of God's Word."
4,nice overview of Sinatra,"There are very few DVDs or Videos covering Frank Sinatras life. This set is the closest I ve found. If you are looking for a lot of his music this isn't the set,but it covers Sinatras life very well. You'll find clips from many of his movies and TV shows as well as important milestones in his life. If you get a couple of his TV shows such as ""A Man and his Music"",the Rat Pack Dismas house DVDand the excellent A@E Rat Pack Biography along with this set you would have a nice DVD collection of Sinatra..his music and his life."
2,Very dissapointed,I had no idea when I purchased the Sinatra DVD set that it would be a 5 hour history of his life and career (most of which we know) and very little singing.Most of the 3 DVDS consist of short musical sound bites and talk.
2,Not enough voice from The Voice,"I was disappointed by this production but perhaps that was because I was expecting something different. Sinatra's life and growth was outlined from the early years but I found it repetitive and a little tedious. There is not much Sinatra fans don't know about his life. What I really wanted was the hear him sing! Why couldn't the producers have played the songs in the sequence they were recorded and weave the story around them.One scene showed him sitting on a stool saying how wonderful the song he was about sing was ... unfortunately, we never heard it! The same thing happened more than once and was extremely frustrating.If you want to hear The Man sing then this is not the collection for you. Stick to the CDs."
2,Bad sound quality and singing...,"I had bought this CD for my daughter because of the great reviews on Amazon. I love the idea of it and the selection of songs is very appropriate and fun.I was VERY disappointed, though, in the sound quality and especially the fact that the singing is often out of tune. I honestly can't bear to hear the CD for more than a few minutes. Because of that I feel like it was a waste of money."
4,Vampire------A game of Political Intrigue,"This book tells me that White Wolf is Pissed! This book tells how VtM is not a game just about killing and being a demi-god. I know, I know, this comes as a shock for some of you. This book also gives good advice for storytellers, like ""George has a strength of 5; average strength is 2... why the hell does George have a strength of 5, did he work out a lot, no...he was a hacker geek? This does not make sense!"" The only reason I give this book 4 stars rather than 5, is because we all love the fiction that goes with it(well, at least I do...) and, sorry to say, this book has no fic. Questions, comments, b!%ch outs? E-mail me at son_of_lux@yahoo.com"
5,Interesting new angle on atomic age,"Fascinating account of how atomic themes permeated popular culture and influenced postwar youth. It's rare to find a historian who can so acutely demonstrate that history does not merely encompass timelines and facts and events, but includes how those living a given 'history' think, what they yearn for, and what they fear."
5,Learning From the Past,"Although this book appears to be intended for college research and study, it also has appeal for anyone interested in social history and the atomic age.Scheibach looks at the decade after Hiroshima and the beginning of the Cold War through the eyes of those who were teens at the time. He explores the movies, television, comic books, school newspapers and the school curriculum, literature, and the works of the students themselves. It's a compelling look back at a time when teens had to face the the prospect of oblivion at the very time when they were looking toward their own futures. How did they handle it?Atomic Narratives and American Youth never mentions the obvious parallel of teens then and youth now during a new era of War on Terrorism. The analogy isn't perfect, but it's similar enough so that a book about the decade 1945-1955 is particularly timely today."
4,Worked well,"Well first off it came on time,and its exactly as described. I bought it knowing it was the wrong size, but the plastic is really easy to drill new holes into. So i made it work."
5,The Clone,"It was a very nice transaction. Prompt delivery, the CD has great songs and good quality. I personnally like four of the songs in the novela, but I am sure you'll love the CD.Thank you,SC"
1,nothing to do with the TV soapopera version,"It's really too slow, not a good option to have the music from the program."
2,Barely audible sound quality,"There are a number of nice features on this phone, but they are all overshadowed by its extremely poor sound quality. We have the handset turned up to the maximum, and yet we can often barely hear people on the other end of the line. In addition, since we bought it there have been mysterious clicks occurring on the line -- everyone is constantly asking us if our line is tapped.The sound quality of the outgoing answering message is also poor. Incoming messages sound fine, though.The battery life is fine. But the sound quality really makes this a hard phone to use. We are buying something else, after owning it for only two months."
1,Southwestern Bell FF2128,"Same audio problems with ours, only the microphone is weak as well as the speaker. Also, we can't seem to find a replacement battery that works, after 3 trips to RadioShack! This one's going in the dumpster real soon..."
4,Fun and easy hobby!,"I loved this book because of the detailed instructions and beautiful color photos. I made one bead following the instructions and I haven't been able to stop since! The projects are perfect for kids because of the simplicity, and a great rainy-day craft because you already have the materials at hand. I've made some really cool jewelry that I can guarantee no one else has."
5,"Madonna with some soul,,,and of course, Dance","Great mixes of this song,,,Great Dance mixes and the I prefer the Allstar Mix to the original,,,,"
4,tease your country,"Cynics? Reprobates? All that and ironic too. There is nothing like throwing back a few (hundred) beer and seeing the Teasers live, with the exception of playing poker long into the night with Satan is Real Again cranked. This album has some of the wittiest lyrics ever with a good dose of social commentary thrown in the mix. The music is raw and strangely reminiscent of the Clash running headlong into Hank Williams Sr. while Tom Waits reports the brutal events. Don't even bother if you like Clint Black or Mariah Carey, but if a Whiskey voiced hillbilly punk band from Scotland is what you have in mind, then you should have bought this album years ago."
5,A messy little wonder,"What do you get when you get a bunch of drunk Scottish guys who rip off riffs from the Fall and Joy Division and throw them into their anti-P.C. country music? You get this masterpiece of drunken hilarity. But besides being funny and offensive, they are actually great songwriters. Saying they are witty is way too much of an understatement. The riffs may not be totally original, but the delivery definitely is. After you've heard it more times and don't focus on the lyrical content and take the songs in as a whole, you will see them for the sloppy wonders that they are.There really is no other band like the Country Teasers, and you gotta love a band that wants to smash down the P.C. walls and make it okay to make fun of everything again. Everything they have recorded is great, but this is their master work. I can't say enough good things about it.If you are P.C., like slick productions, and bands who don't miss a note, the Country Teasers are not for you."
4,Not to be read in one sitting,"Very well written (although a bit dry) analytical comparison of the various ancient goddess figures found throughout European archaeological sites. Difficult to read quickly due to the author's writing style. Also, I was very disappointed that there were no illustrations/photographs of the figures mentioned, nor any maps of the locations they were found at. But overall, a very good effort."
4,Average Compilation,"I was hoping this would be more than simply seasons 1-3 packed together but I was mistaken. This box set is the same as buying seasons 1, 2, and 3 separately except it comes with new case pictures and a children's wash-off tattoo. There are a few new special features but they kept the cut scenes out of this version. I really had hoped this would contain the scenes cut from the original dvds.If you don't already have seasons 1-3 on disk than this is a good deal but if you do this is not worth it. All three seasons are subtitled so if you bought an older version like I did before they subtitled them this is a bit better.Rebelde: la serie completa es basicamente temporadas 1-3 en una cosita. Si ya tiene rebelde en dvd entonces no compra esto porque no es nada nuevo. La tiene 'los mejores besos', unas videos de rbd, pleitos, 'las mejored escenas de amor', trayecotiras, y una galeria. Si no tiene temporadas 1-3 entonces debes comprar eso porque no es un robo."
1,I love the show - i hate whoever sold me this scratched set of DVDs,i bought this product in hopes that it would help me improve my spanish - which it did- no doubt!however on the second disk - second side - the show would skip chapters - and of course by the 3rd disk - i was completely lost on what was happening.if only the disks wouldn't skip - i would be completely satisfied with my purchase - however i think i might have to send this complete 3 season set back - and purchase a new one from someone else.it really isnt that bad of a show - its whoever is selling it that you should be cautious of!
4,Great value box set,"This box set is fantastic value for the three series of Rebelde. The only thing that would have made it better for me, would be the presence of Spanish subtitles, as the box set only has English subtitles."
1,HALF of the soap opera is missing...,They cut out A LOT. a lot of the soap opera the first episode is like the first two weeks of episodes.... it is so abridged it isn't even funny...
3,SOmething has to be wrong,"I just bought this, and it seems ok, except the fact that there are missing parts and i dont understand why?! Maybe it has to be with the fact that i am watching it on my p/c ..i dont know. Hopefully ill figure it out, if not well thats how this dvd is.! Enjoy"
4,good buy,"If you are looking for a reliable no-nonsense phone that you can depend on, this phone is a good buy. It isn't fancy but it gets the job done very effectivly."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this phone because I thought it was good looking and the price was great! However after having it only a year, I cant use my phone for more than 20 minutes without the battery dying. I charge it all the time that I am not using it (which is most of the time) and the battery still dies. Forget about having more than 1 phone call a night, it dies quickly even if you charge it in between calls. I suggest spending a few dollars more and getting a better quality phone. I am currently looking for a new one, but this time I am doing better research!"
5,Great for Beginner or Professional,"I own several pieces by Marirose and she is a dream to work with. Her work is top notch and I admire and respect her talent, but this is a review of book.I can barely sew and these patterns work for me. I've made 3 of them so far and I have trouble even threading a needle or running a machine. The layout and explanations make sense to an amateur.On the other hand, she reproduces patterns here for some very rare and hard to find fashions that a Professional could certainly enjoy making.It's a great book, from a wonderful lady.I can't say enough good, except to add that she did not ask me to review her book or anything like that.Go Marirose!"
4,Vintage clothes,There are some really sweet outfits to make for fashion dolls and patterns and instructions that make the job easier. Photos are bright and clear.
5,Always on top of the stack,"I stumbled across this gem a year or so ago when cruising a bookstore's home improvement section -- and have been in love ever since. The recipes are easy to follow, take very little time to make, and the ingredients are readily available at local stores. And the recipes /work/. My personal favorite is the Wonder Spray, an all purpose home cleaner that cuts grease better than certain national name brands.Save money, and save yourself from harmful fumes and skin destroying chemicals."
4,Just take the parts you want,"Good book, I use it all the time as a reference. Whenever I'm ready to try a something new, to explore an alternative, I grab the book (which my wife stores in the cleaning closet). The ingredients are safe (bonus) and cheap (bonus). I especially like the cost saving analysis. The names for everything get a bit over the top. Some alternatives can be more than you want (she doesn't believe in vacume cleaners for example), but just take what you want/need from the book."
2,earth-friendly housekeeping,"Great ideas, but way too much lecturing. Give me one chapter on the perils of chemicals, and then get on with the practical solutions."
1,Disappointing and hypocritical,"I was disappointed in this book, most of the recipes are ones you can find for free on the web, have heard of a million times, or can figure out on your own...like using plain baking soda as a cleanser instead of Comet. Most of the recipes are repetitive. The most annoying aspect though, the author rants about how ANY artificial/chemical product (like commercial dishwashing liquid and artificial scents) is too risky to use in her opinion, but then she turns around and uses commercial dish soap and artificial berry scent in later recipies. I returned mine, don't bother with this one."
1,Overreliance on just a few products,"Karen picks just a few products and uses those for each of her recipes. I would've liked to see more products, hydrogen peroxide for example. Also, I really wanted more of an explanation of the chemistry of cleaning, so that I would be able to figure out which products to use myself."
1,Not-So-Clean Rip-Off,"This book looks suspiciously like a rip-off of Annie Berthold-Bond's groundbreaking Clean and Green to me. Karen Logan appears to have been willing to capitalize on all of Berthold-Bond's hard work of research and formulating, even copying some of her stories (the borax in the toilet one, for instance). How clean is that? I guess you can't copyright recipes, or I suspect Ms. Logan would be in trouble with the authorities. I'd rather go with the original, not the copycat: Clean and Green has real heart along with the great information."
5,This book will change your life!,"Okay, maybe that's a bit of hyperbole, but this is really an excellent book with numerous recipes for your own cleaning products. I use many of them and they really work well with the added benefit of being non-toxic. I tell as many people as will listen about how wonderful homemade cleaning products can be. They're easy and fun to make, inexpensive and good for you and the environment. I'm a convert!Other reviewers complained that they cannot contact the author to buy labels or bottles. I designed my own labels on my computer and covered them with clear contact paper so the colors wouldn't run if they got wet.Buy this book, you will not regret it!"
4,Tina's review,I really appreciated the information on the current household cleaners and all the toxic chemicals in them. I am an asthmatic and I need to know why the chemicals cause me breathing problems. The alternatives in the book are very helpful and easy to prepare. I am preparing my home to make a chemical free switch. It is much more cost effective also.
5,Very Resourceful!,Has recipes for nearly every cleaning task you can think of. It has been my go to book every time I've mad a natural cleaning product for my home and car. It even has recipes to get rid of pesky ant problems! Great Resource with easy recipes.
5,Clean the Non-Toxic Way for Dirt Cheap,This is just the best book. Quite often I am disappointed by books I order but not this time! There are great ideas on how to make your own cleaning products and I can't wait to get started on this. It is very inspiring without being preachy. I highly recommend this to anyone but especially to people with sensitivities to chemicals and unnaturally scented products.
5,"Simple, easy recipes!","My friend and I made most of the major recipes in this book in the course of a few hours! We found all the ingredients at the market, health food store and Target. We both went home and cleaned our houses top to bottom and were amazed at the results. I thought for sure the glass cleaner wouldn't work - boy, was I surprised! I have since bought several copies of the book to give away to friends and family. My friends with young children really love the recipes! Most importantly for me, these products smell divine! I feel like I am perfuming my house rather than cleaning. My kitchen smells softly of lemons, and my bathroom has a lovely, light, lavender aroma. From now on I'm cleaning the natural, non-toxic, better smelling way!"
5,Amazing!,"I bought this book because of the great reviews this book got on Amazon.com and I have to say that this is one of the best books I've ever bought.I didn't realize how much money I threw away for household cleaners that were toxic to my health. Clean House, Clean Planet gives quick, cheap, fun and easy recipes to make for household cleaners.From a glass cleaner to fabric softener, there are so many cleaning recipes. It was worth the money, everyone should own this book."
4,Great book that could use a new edition,"I started making my own nontoxic cleaning products using recipes and information from the internet. I stumbled across this book, and it has some great recipes and tips. Because it was published in 1997, there are no references to websites for resources, only phone numbers and addresses. The author also discontinued her business selling containers, which she promotes in this book, so you'll have to find them elsewhere (but that's pretty easy).I agree with other reviewers that there's a lot of redundant information. I would love to see this book rewritten, updated and tightly edited. Then, it would be perfect."
2,Bought it and sent it back,"Redundant, redundant and redundant.I bought this book and sent it back almost immediately. It has a handful of recipes which are repeated over and over and over. Some of which no matter how often you use them do not work. If you want a true bible of clean green cleaning turn to ""Better Basics for the Home : Simple Solutions for Less Toxic Living"". It is a MUCH better book."
5,Everyone should have this book!,"this book is awesome! i wish everyone could read it and see for themselves how we create some of the migraines we have, allergies we go through etc. This book shows a great alternative for the nasty products out on the market today!!!"
2,You get what you pay for,I bought this phone just to have as an emergency land line. It suits my needs. You can't read the display and I hate the flashing light that signals a call recieved but it is fine for a back up phone.
2,Misleading Picture,"This bicycle seat is not as large as the picture lead me to believe. I guess I should have read the description more closely. My order arrived earlier than anticipated, so that was a nice surprise. I haven't installed the seat on my tricycle that I bought on Amazon.com yet, so I'm taking a ""wait and see"" attitude on how comfortable it is. The seat that came with the trike is very uncomfortable and caused lower back pain so I'm hoping for the best."
2,Couldn't find a good position,"I bought this a while back thinking it was going to be really great and I was disappointed. I installed the seat and rode and while the seat was stable and well made, it was awkward riding. I tilted the seat up and down but I could never find a good position to ride in. I felt like I was either falling forward or back. I ended up returning it."
2,too small to sit on in confort,Shape is right but the size is wrongit not near big enough for a normal personto sit on comfortablyno matter how I adjust it it's not comfortablelooks to be sized for kidsThe seat that came with my Schwinn Airdyne isnot perfectbut its a lot better than this one!
4,It's an improvement,"I bought this seat to replace the original seat that was on my Schwinn Air-Dyn exercise bike. Once I tried this new seat I found it much improved in that I can exercise longer without causing pain to my uh, plumbing.The seat comfort changed but since it is a different design I expected that and I believe I will get used to the new seat layout."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"2 years ago I came down with an autoimmune disease and in the process, gained 30 pounds. I also realized I was probably shortening my life by spending it hunched over the computer. But I work online. Solution? Opted to get aFitDesk(a.k.a., exercise bike with a laptop desk attached). Only problem was, the seat was not especially kind to my now-ample backside. I tried and tried to woman up, to no avail. Fortunately a seat adapter came out for the FitDesk, and I jumped on this baby. I was a little worried that even this would not endear me to long stretches on the bike, but it's just what I needed. For an upright bike design, there's no bumping of the thighs, and at last my new pas-de-deux with gravity is bearable. Ahhh."
4,smaller than appears,I didn't read description and seat is smaller than I thought.It's more comfortable that original seat but not as large.
2,Poor dimensions,"Bought this hoping to ease pressure but found it to be rather difficult to sit on and ride. Part of the problem is the length. The seat is too big. It winds up digging into the back of your legs and is very uncomfortable. Even adjusting it all the way back I found it difficult. Returned to amazon shortly after purchasing. I am a man of average height (5'10"") and medium build."
3,"My opinion,Owner AGEM Products Company","Hi, not a bad seat at all. Do you by chance offer any type of back support; a seat back that is very light weight, that can be easily attached to the seat mounting stem (I'm not sure if this is the correct term?)If so, please email me information at agemone@aol.com.Best regards,Anthony G. Maglio"
1,No comfortable position,"Installed this seat as soon as we got it for my Wife, who rides a Hybrid. Well, she was either slipping out of the seat all the time, or the corners prevent her from pedaling properly. We ended up cutting our ride short. Sending this back to Amazon today. I'm sure this may fit for someone, but I would say, be ready if it doesn't quite work out."
1,good idea...poor solution,"I had just bought a new bike. The usual ""penal numbness"" from the saddle. All the other ""anatomically correct"" saddles that I saw on the market (lots of them) were way too expensive. This ""No Pressure"" seat was within my budget. Quick, easy sale; quick, easy delivery. Schwinn was partially correct, there is no numbness, HOWEVER, at least in my case, my thighs kept rubbing against the saddle. After trying a variety of saddle-to-post adjustments, I finally put the original saddle back on, got out my trusty penknife and cut the padding out of the horn. This home made remedy did the trick."
1,Not good for a road bike,I'm not a fan of this seat. It may work well on a mountain bike for slow casual riding but it did not work on a road bike. It left the back of my thighs bruised from the constant pounding against the edges. Sloping the seat means you cannot sit on it. It may work for you but it didn't for what I needed to do.
2,Not Bad but not Good either,My husband and I hoped this seat would be comfortable for long distances on the bikes. It just isn't...sorry. Some may find with repeated adjustments that a good fit can be found but we tried repeatedly for 3 weeks to get a descent fit. Either you slide off or have pain at the back of the thighs and it never resolves the age old problem of a sore butt! We're back to our usual seats and after the experience with the schwinn seat we feel happier with the old seat. Maybe your experience would be different than ours but the lack of benefit was clear for us.
1,Not good,"I bought this seat for my husband. He tried to use it, stopped and adjusted it, still he did not like it. Complained that he had to hold himself on the seat with his arms. I thought it was just him, so I tried it. I used it on two rides and said, Take it off. Maybe it depends on the type of bike you ride. Well, I have ordered another Schwinn seat and hope it works out okay.Gloria in Kansas"
1,Why I returned this seat,"Purchased seat for a Schwinn airdyne excerciser. Tried it in all possible positions--raised, lowered, tilted back and forth, etc. In all positions it was uncomfortable and insecure. Never tried it on a regular bike. (It weighs a ton.) Cannot recommend."
5,Bike seat purchase,"I purchased the Schwinn no pressure bicycle seat. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I am very happy with this product. It does take a little getting used to after many years of riding on traditional seats, however, the level of comfort is fantastic! I can ride long distances without constantly having to stand on the pedals. Highly recommended for all ""soft"" bottoms."
1,it's not for adults,it actually hurts more than all seats I've tried so farthe edges are very hard and because of the size it's edges are the main contact surfaceit might work for kids but not definitely for adultsif the designer had used softer material it might be betteralso because of the shape it's just works for beach cruisers not all bike types(angel doesn't let your feet move freely)
4,no pressure bicycle seat,This seat is much more comfortable than the seat that came with the bike. There is no horn on this one and it has a lot more foam inside to make it better. Thanks for getting it here so fast too.
2,....and it didn't like me!,"Granted, everybody's anatomy differs, esp in the posteria, but this saddle did not live up to my expectations or other purchasers comments. I found it to be very rigid and uncomfortable compared to my existing saddle that i hoped to replace. instead, i returned this saddle to the seller who did provide me with very timely delivery."
3,Its OK,not really what I thought it should be you slide forward no matter how you tip the seat. Just not like the regular seats but puts less pressure where you dont want pressure.
4,good product,"Does ease the pressure off of your butt, but there is a learning curve with the fact that you don't have a nose on this thing."
3,Okay,"I bought this in anticipation of the seat comfort on my ordered Air Dyne. While this is okay, I found that the original seat was great. If you order the Air Dyne, do not get this seat till you try the original seat."
3,Does what it's supposed to but a bit awkward,"I've used this seat several times and it definitely feels a lot better than the normal seats in the 'important' areas ;)However, it does take some getting used to. The dynamics of this seat have much more of your body weight supported by your (my) arms. I don't go on long rides with it as my arms get tired (less than 1 hr rides and you get a good upper body workout).That said - it does what I bought it for which is not provide so much pressure on the groin ...."
3,Not as Comfortable as Billed,"I purchased this seat recently because I thought I would like it better than the hard seat that I previouly had. I really liked the fact that it didn't have a middle part sticking out that was so uncomfortable on my other seat. What I have found is that while it's more comfortable than my other seat, it's not as great as promised. It is much more comfortable once it was properly adjusted but I now have the feeling that I might slip off especially when going across slanted driveways or down hills. I am still on the lookout for the perfectly comfortable seat."
4,Schwinn No Pressure Bycycle Seat,"This seat is a must buy and own for a man user of the Schwinn Airdyne Bicycle, especially if he weighs over 180 pounds. Safer and more confortable for a male."
3,Not for us!,"The seat is nice and soft, very comfy. But without the usual front pointed area, you feel like you are going to fall off of it. My husband received this seat for his birthday and he tried it out by going on a 15 mile bike ride, which he typically does on the weekends, and he didn't like it. I did not send the seat back, there is nothing wrong with it, just wasn't right for him. I am thinking of putting it on my bike and trying it out for myself. We shall see."
1,Nope! Really uncomfortable.,THought it would be super comfy. Instead I just kept slipping off. Then I adjusted 500 times - still slip. You want to buy mine? I'll give it to you cheap! Its in a bucket of stuff to sell st our next yard sale. Ya can't build a better mouse trap - same goes for a bike seat.
2,Can't Pitch Forward Enough To Be Comfortable; Hurts Underside Of Legs,"I am a bit shorter than average male (5'8"") and not at all overweight with a hybrid bike, and I found this seat very uncomfortable.As others have mentioned, it cuts into the underside of your upper legs as you peddle. And, at least on my bike, there is no way to rotate the front side down enough to avoid this.I liked the idea of a tractor style seat. But, on a tractor, your legs work pedals far in front of you. On a bike, even with an upright sitting position one, your action is constantly pushing down. I could find no position on this saddle that made it a pleasant ride. I even tried sitting fully in the seat, legs lifted up, while coasting downhill. Still uncomfortable.I didn't give it one star, since there is no defect with the product. It's pretty much as described, but I for one am going back to more traditionally shaped seats."
1,Not comfortable,I always felt as if I was falling off from the seat. It was no more comfortable than the original seat that camewith the AeroDyne.
4,good seat.,"Good seat, not to comfortable. Work out and get off fast, so that could be good. May be this seat could be good for thinner people. When I get there I’ll let you know. Lol."
3,"Good shape, but too soft. I would love a firmer model.","The seat is an ok shape for a small or medium bum, but too soft. I would prefer a firm seat as my bum and thigh end up pushing through the material and it digs into my leg...however i much prefer this seat to the traditional style where crotch circulation is cut and body part(s) may become numb! I do not imagine that large bums would prefer a larger platform, although it may be worth a try to lose the saddle with a horn!"
2,PRETTY CHEAP,"This seat is supposed to replace the standard bike seat on the Schwinn Airdyne. It is a pretty cheap and inferior replacement. The seat base that attaches to the bike is smaller than the regular base. The regular base has a sturdy internal collar with a long bolt that goes through the base bracket. The replacement is made with a nominal amount of metal so it simply sits on top of the ""pipe"" that comes out of the bike base. THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT TO TILT THE SEAT FORWARD OR BACK. THEREFORE, BASED ON HOW YOU LIKE TO SIT WHEN YOU RIDE YOUR BIKE, YOU CAN BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. I HATE THIS SEAT."
1,Didn't work for us,My husband bought one seat this past weekend and we were anxious to try it out. He put it on his bike and then I tried it on mine. We were very dissapointed. Evan with much adjusting...it felt like you were going to fall off the bike. It also was not comfortable on your back. It threw off your balance. At first glance the concept is a very good idea...but this is one that needs to go back to the drawing board.
2,For cruising rides only,The sales pitch for this seat does not clarify that it's for cruisers or slow rides only. It really cannot be used for faster rides. It's very hard to sit on it and petal at a fast rate.
1,NOT !,"Purchased this seat to decrease the numbness incurred while riding a Schwinn Airdyne Evo. Seat easily assembled to the bike and looks exactly like the pictures; but is not nearly as wide as the stock seat from Schwinn. Nor is it as padded. VERY uncomfortable! NOT usable! After two honest efforts to give it a fair trial, I simply had to go back to the original seat. The edges of the seat feel like sharp corners through the thin cover. Maybe if this seat was twice as wide and had more padding ..."
5,Great seat!,"While the seat does take a bit of getting used to, it is the most comfortable seat I have used."
1,Seat,I was expecting the seat to be extremely comfortable after reading so many reviews the fact it it is hard and extremely uncomfortable for me.I will have to still look for one with more comfort.
2,Seat is too Chubby!,"I felt the width of this seat interferred with the downward movement of my legs. I just couldn't get comfortable on it. Sit forward on the edge of a chair and try to bicycle your legs, you'll get what I mean. I took it back."
3,no presssure bike seat,"this seat was just what my wife needed. she has had two knee replacements, and the original seat made it hard for her to ride just right"
4,What a difference a seat will make!,"This seat is MUCH more comfortable than the seats that originally came with the bikes I bought for my boyfriend and I. We had decided to get healthier together, but those itty-bitty original bike seats made it very uncomfortable for our larger-than-we-want-them-to-be bums. So, I got both of us one of these seats. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Now we bike several nights a week and don't need to sit on a pillow for the next few days. Thanks!My one gripe would be that one of them came missing a part, but we were able to cannibalize the original Schwinn seat to compensate. The seats themselves are comfortable, no rips, tears, etc. They arrived timely. Again, thank you!"
4,Bicycle Seat,This seat was for my wife after trying several seat she is happy with this one. She rides several miles each day and the seat has mate the ride more confortable. If any thing happened to this one would have to have another
1,Adjustment issues,"Seat comfort is as individual as the cheeks that ride it, but I bought this seat with really high hopes, and when it was installed on my trek, I eaither felt like I was sliding off the front of it, or riding across the front ""ridge"". I tried raising or lowering it, and different tilt adjustments to no avail. To be fair, this may be more an issue of overall bike geometry, but I couldn't get it right."
2,"Schwinn No pressure, Why did I hurt then?","I was looking forward to this new seat, Had to make several adjustments before feeling safe enough, seemed to slide off the front. Rode 15 miles and was sore for a week, removed the seat and went back to the old standby. Just did not fit my skinny backside and pushed the back of my upper thighs so much that I was sore there too. Maybe good for some but not for me. NOW how to get them back to Amazon."
1,You will hate your bike ride.,Looks like a great new design but it hurts to ride with this seat. Road for about about 10 blocks and stopped at a bike shop to buy a new seat. Returned seat to Amazon.
2,"Great idea, but.....","I am new to cycling and found my saddle uncomfortable to say the least. I tried this saddle, thinking that without the horn, my female parts would be happier. It's true there is little discomfort but I felt as if I being forced forward and my wrists took all my upper body weight. Plus, turning felt very unsafe. I am going to tough it out on my current saddle, and returned this one."
2,Not as good of an idea as thought,"Albeit the saddle looks like it will actually ""take the pressure off,"" it the Schwinn No Presser Bike Seat introduces other problems. Although the problems is not a male health concern, it interferes with normal biking. While pedaling, our thighs are continuously angling up and down as we pedal. The conventional seats allow this type of movement with little obstruction. With the ""no pressure"" seat, it either forces us to sit further forward or deal with the front lip under our thighs. Seating further forward will take us away from the comfortable sweet spot almost to where it feels as though we'll be slipping off.The best remedy I have found in a comfortable bike seat must fit three criterion. A firm seat (gel pad consistency), an open groove for the offending area and the ability to adjust the seat to angle a bit more downwards. I have yet to find something more suitable."
2,Seat small for adults,"This seat was too small for me, an adult of 6 ft and 150 lbs. I could not position it for comfort because of the size. I do not recommend it for the average adult."
1,Schwinn No Pressure Seat Is Not Good,"Two seats were purchased. One for an exercise bike and one for a multi-speed road bike each needing more comfort. The Schwinn No Pressure Seat in each case did not perform well and it only took 10 seconds of use to reach this conclusion. It creates a crease line going across each leg where bending over the edge of the seat. Should a recumbent bike be used, then this seat would be suitable. For any normal bicycle (coaster, 10 speed or BMX etc.) where the pedals are below the seat, then this seat is NOT for you!"
2,Not Happy with this one,"Way smaller than it looks in pics , not comfortable or cusioned , save your money or try one of those cloud nine seats better than this one ."
2,hurts thighs,"the straight across ledge hurts my thighs, but this is better than any comfort seat w/horn. i'm exchanging this for the split butt-cheek seat...i hope that will be perfect."
3,Schwinn No Pressure Seat,"I ordered this seat when I ordered the bike because I had used one the airdynes before and the bicycle seat on it was uncomfortable. When the new airdyne arrived, it had a larger, much more comfortable seat than the one I had been using so I wound up using it rather than the no pressure seat."
5,"GREAT, IF YOU ARE PADDED","IF YOU HAVE A BONEY BUTT, THIS IS NOT THE SEAT FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE PADDED, ITS GREAT.NOT TOO COMFY FOR A MAN, BUT WORKED FOR ME"
3,"better than a normal seat, but...","This is a big improvement over a normal (pointed) seat.But if they wanted to eliminate pressure, why did they put a raised ridge RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE where a man does NOT need to feel pressure??Even better would have been a slightly lower ""channel"" in the middle. Also, even with a seatpost that sets it back a bit, it still feels like it is too far forward for efficient pedaling. I had to put the frame in a vise and change the shape of the steel rails in order to get it a couple of inches further back."
3,It takes awhile to get used to it.,"I'm still trying to decide if I want to use this seat or go back to a padded Gel one. I had to lower the seat to use it, and still keep sliding off, but it definately is easier on the ol skinny backside."
