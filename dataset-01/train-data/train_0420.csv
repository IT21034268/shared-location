4,More Deserving Than Some Reviewers Gave It,"This is not a high-speed chase, cut scene, after cut scene, type of movie and maybe that's why some reviewers gave it 1 and 2 Stars, but that's because you actually have to have an attention span longer than 30 seconds to really enjoy this lost gem.""The Lookout"" does have its flaws, but the good acting of Jeff Daniels and Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Third rock from the sun) pulls it all together in the end. If you have patience, and a desire to view a better than average thriller, take your time and let it spin its web, you won't be disappointed."
2,Bought this for $4 and I think I overpaid.,"So, I got this on a good deal as a 'blind-buy.' Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a good actor. Sadly, this movie is really boring and predictable. It's been done better a thousand times, I don't understand Hollywood's fascination with bank robberies."
4,SIMILIAR TO THE TOWN,GREAT MOVIE. I DO RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE. SIMILIAR TO THE TOWN WITH BEN AFFLECT. GREAT STORYGREAT MOVIE. SELLER IS GREAT.
3,Not too bad,I really didn't know what to expect with this movie because i had not heard of it. It was a good story and the acting was good. It wasn't a crazy spectacular movie but very good.
5,More than a book about rhythm and blues music,"A friend of mine gave me ""Only the Strong Survive"" as a Christmas gift, and now I treasure it as one of the best gifts I've ever received.This is more than a book about music--although eighty percent of it is. It is a history book, political book, inspirational book -- you name it! One would never think that a rhythm and blues singer had that much depth. For example, Mr. Butler uses the tragic case of his former bongo player to show the horrors of the war in Vietnam. Then, turning to politics, he reminds us of the debt we owe the late Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, and what all of us can do to make this world a better place. It is at once inspirational and entertaining, thought-provoking and profound -- a must-read for all serious readers!"
2,Okay... but,"While i like Jerry Butler, this wasn't the best read..... but Jerry Butler..... Go on sir.... I would love to see a biopic."
3,aves sin nido,I already received and this product is very good. I suggest for all people interest in latino america literature and anti-colonizing and feminism
2,"The Classic Story, Terribly Edited","I'm not even going to comment on the story because it is spectacular and captivating and hundreds of other review will tell you that better than I.My critique is this edition, the 30th Anniversary Signet Edition, has more typos than I have ever seen in a published book. Granted, they total about 10, but again, more than I've ever seen in any bound book. Did no one think to re-edit for this 'special' anniversary edition? Shame on you, Signet publishers."
3,Not as good as the movie,"In most cases a book is better than a movie based on it- but the there are exceptions, and the 'Godfather' is one of them. In this case it is not that the book is bad- it is actually quite enjoyable- but 'The Godfather' is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.The movie is very true to the plot of the book, but I was also struck by how much dialogue in the movie is straight out of the book. That is the real strength of the book: the dialogue. The other facets of Puzo's writing are not as strong. The story loses focus and momentum with the Johnny Fontane subplot, but overall is a good read."
5,How can a book this famous and old be so good?,"If I read this when it came out, it must have been in paperback. The movies were stupendous. So recently I thought I would read the book (again?) Bad idea. I was trapped by Puzo's amazing writing and had to buy all the sequels and about everything else Puzo ever wrote. Haven't yet read them all yet, but I am beginning to speak Sicilian. The author's ability to read the human soul is uncanny. No wonder his books are said to have been approved by the mafia. They tell the story of people like all others (some good, some bad), who have elevated the concept of family above that of all other allegiances, and for good reason. Considering the ""families"" as countries, it seems that they are no worse and often better than other ""countries"" in how they care for themselves and relate to other nations."
5,"LOVE THIS BOOK, HAVE ALWAYS LOVED IT THROUGHOUT MY LIFETIME ;:)","with my kindle every single book will be nicer to read :) The Godfather is a classic and love it. However i guess the foreword was a bit too long but at the same time super recommendable and interesting for people studying a career related to movies such as movie maker, producer, director, etc. It is absolutely didactic and entertaining at the same time."
5,Great Read,"If you love the movie, you will love the book. This book gives great back story and allows you more insight to the characters and relationships."
4,4.5 Stars! Here's an offer you can't refuse...,"You have my permission to laugh at the fact that I have never seen these movies. But I think that this might have given me a more unique perspective in that I didn't know what to expect from this book.This book was GREAT! A truly modern classic. I wish that Mr. Puzo had written more additions to this story line, but I will enjoy picking up ""The Sicilian"" to continue the series.There are a few scenes in this book that should be intended for adults only, and frankly, I think the story could have done without them. But the overall feel of the success of the Corleone Familia was quite intriquing."
5,The Godfather,"The Godfather was one of the best books I've ever read. In fact I don't read much, but this book's awsome. It is very descriptive, more than the moviea, and has some parts of the story untold in the movies. The greatest book!"
5,A WELL DONE BIT OF FICTION,"I do have to start with the admission that I do feel the movie was, in the case, better than the book. Anyway, I enjoyed it more. That could be just me though. That being said, I do feel this work is well worth the read. It certainly will grab your attention and hold it. I would rank it a bit above pulp fiction as the author's style and character developement is quite good and the story line certainly works. Even those who do not particularly enjoy ""ganster books,"" (I fit that category), will find something to like about this book. It is simply well done! I would certainly approach the book as entertainment rather than a social comment on our society, as I am not sure of the accuracy of the research that went into it. Anyway, read it and enjoy and I do highly recommend."
5,A Book You Can't Refuse!,"With the publication of ""The Godfather Returns"" I decided to read it's predecessor. I was amazed at the character study that this book represents and the fact that it was written 35 years ago further adds to the intrigue. This is the story of the Corleone Family and their existence in the N.Y. Mafia. The story covers a time span of the early 1900's until the late 1940's and it is an amazing work."
2,One Of The Few Examples Where The Movie Is Better Than The Book,"Anyone who says that this book is better than the movie knows little about literature, and even less about film.I was impressed with how close the movie was to the book, almost scene for scene. And the book isn't bad, but it is not as dramatic, cerebral, or complex as the film.It is clear that in the film version Francis Ford Copolla and the stellar cast (Marlin Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall) improved upon almost every aspect of the book. They turned what is a decent paperback crime novel into high art, and I don't see how anyone can watch the film and not be disappointed by the book."
5,"Classic, Classic, Classic !",What else can I say. A must read for anyone interested in Mafia. One of the greatest books I have ever read!
3,"Puzo: A good story teller, a less than stellar writer","Like most people, I saw the movie long before I every dreamed of reading the book. I was not sure what I exactly expected, but I was very disappointed. I found Puzo to be nothing above an average write, and the writing throughout was clumsy. Case in point: count the times he writes, ""made his bones."" That line appears once in the movie (thanks, Mo!), but seemingly arrives in the book every several pages. It was painful.That said, the story is great, and it was wonderful to see some Godfather II story worked into original (which was a surprise). I give the book a slight recomendation, but only as a way to aid the movie. This is certainly a case where the movie is far superior to the book, and the book's worth is more as a novelty related to the movie, rather than on is own merits."
4,The Godfather,"Personally I thought that Mario Puzo's The Godfather was very well written and interesting. It's about an Italian Mob related family. The book was well thought out and hard to put down. The description was excellent as I could perfectly picture everything that was happening. I enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading books full of suspense, and action. You can watch the movie also but it's not the same. I recommend the book over the movie."
2,Just Watch the Movie Again,"Since The Godfather is one of my favorite films, I decided to read the novel, following the tenet that the book is always better than the movie. Oh goodness, not true in this case. Mario Puzo writes like a amateur. Example: He's goes on and on for 5 or 6 pages about something (details aren't important) and then actually WRITES ""To make a long story short..."". I gasped. Note, if the novel's writing style was conversational throughout, this would be acceptable. Much to my dismay, it's not.I found Puzo to be a quite lazy writer; he just doesn't take the time to think about a better way of forming his words and telling the story. So, I say if you enjoy the film as much as I do, and yearn for more background story and character development, please please shy away from this horrible piece of pulp. Just watch the movie again."
3,"Strong, But Constantly Strayed From The Important Characters","I read The Godfather after I had seen the movie about 20 times. The movie is wonderful! Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and the unforgettable Marlon Brando brought the beauty and evil out of the Mafia. When I read the book, I was expecting a brilliant piece of literature. I was disappointed. Who cares about Lucy Mancini and Johnny Fontaine? I think I'll stick to the movie."
2,The movies are better than the book,"Usually the old maxim of ""the book is better than the movie"" holds true. I can think of a million examples, yet strangely, I'm drawing a blank at the moment.No matter, I bought this book to read on an extended vacation. I never finished it. Why? Because it's boring and poorly written. It's strange, but Coppola & company were able to add the depth to the characters that is sorely lacking in Puzo's novel.It's not even good as pulp fiction, as say a Raymond Chandler or a Dashiell Hammett is. This is a lousy book that was turned into 2 of the greatest films ever made. Why it became such a bestseller in 1969 just proves true that other old maxim: ""A fool and his money are easily parted""."
1,brilliant film; awful novel,"How Francis Ford Coppola found the inspiration for his two masterpieces is beyond me. The Corleone saga became Shakespearean only in Coppola's hands. Puzo is a hack, like John Grisham or Anne Rice. Paramount sought to turn this book into a cheap exploitation film, a crucial fact to ponder when appreciating the novel's ""greatness."" Name one other novel of Puzo's that is even faintly memorable; chances are you cannot. He owes his entire reputation and fortune to the (early) genius and ambition of Coppola."
5,The definitive audio version!,"This audiocassette version, by Brilliance Corp, is thebest version available for this classic novel. Don't settlefor less!--Geoff"
3,A classic?,"The Godfather has had an indelible effect on present day popular culture. The book and novel have spawned an entire new genre of films and literature. However, after reading the novel, I must say that the movie is far superior (which i have only said once before - Shawshank Redemption.)The book is decent, but it drags considerably in the second half. The first 150 pages are intoxicating, the rest are only passable. Moreover, the movie basically follows the novel word for word, even using the same phrases that the novel uses. I have always argued that movies cannot capture the complex nature of characters in novels. However, Coppolla captured the essence of the characters magnifcently. If you have seen the movie, there really is no reason to read the book, other than some minor stories concerning Johnny Fontaine and Lucy Mancini. In the end, a decent novel, but nowhere near the hype or expectation."
4,Movie follows well,"I am a Godfather junkie, so I bought the book to see how well the movie followed the book. The movie is faithful to the book and even has a few extra situations that were not covered in the movie that were interesting."
3,"Overrated, but an interesting read","I came to the book first and then I saw the movie. I have to admit, I find both of them to be overrated. I enjoy mob books and films (Goodfellas and Puzo's The Last Don), but I struggled to get into this one. The characters were somewhat wooden and uninteresting, and I never did see how Michael could have transformed from law-abiding son to a cold-hearted mob boss so easily.However, as another reviwer suggested, this book would have had more potential as a Tom Wolfe-style novel documenting life in the 1940's and 50's. Puzo said that he was ""selling out"" by writing this book, and I believe that he was never happy with this book or receiving the reputation of a pulp writer. Puzo's best book is Fool's Die. Puzo's best mob book,in my opinion, is The Last Don. It's kind of pulpy as well, but maybe because it was set in the contemporary period, I could identify with and enjoy it more."
1,This book is missing about 60 pages,"My book is also missing pages 181 to 244, like the earlier reviewer, obviously this is not an isolated incident."
1,Garbage,"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. This was more than a little surprising since the Godfather is one of my favorite movies. This book is so bad it is hard to understand why Coppola decided to make the movie, although I am glad he did. The hackneyed prose and added attention to the Johnny Fontane character make for pure boredom. If you are contemplating reading this book, I suggest devoting your time to watching the movies instead. It takes about as much time to read this simplistic book as to watch the first two movies."
5,The greatest Book ever,I loved the book and the movie. I read the book twice and plan to read it again. The movie is my favorite and I can't stress how great this book is. READ IT.
5,A Masterpiece...,"I don't get why everyone likes the movie so much more. This book contains subplots that were vastly important, but that the movie lacked. Johnny Fontane's struggles were heart-wrenching. Santino's girlfriend, and the doctor were a perfect diversion. And the cop turn hit-man was a wonderful look into what must have happened to Luca Brasi. And this Godfather is not a thinly veiled thug like the one Marlon Brando played. He's a caring person, who sometimes has to have people killed for what he sees as the greater good."
4,THE GODFATHER I BOUGHT LAST WEEK,"I ORDERED THIS BOOK LAST WEEK. I RECIEVED THE BOOK TODAY IN THE MAIL. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE BOOK- DO SO THAT IT IS USED. I GIVE IT 4 STARS FOR BEING INTACK N ALL. THANXZ FOR THE BOOK, CANT WAIT TO READ IT."
4,New fan for an old classic,"I found a copy in an old box of books in the garage. I had seen the movies prior to reading the book and was in the mood for reading a ""classic."" In spite of the fact that I was already aware of the plot twists to come, I really enjoyed the read. At times, I found myself daydreaming or bogged down with the book's small details. But overall, I enjoyed the excellent character development. The book offers more insight into the Godfather, how he came to be, and into his crime family. By the end, I felt like I knew the ""Godfather"" and his family. It was an interesting, although sometimes arduous read."
4,high school students opinion,"The Godfather by Mario Puzo is an excellent book and a must read for anyone intrested in our countrys history. a book that goes deep into the organized crime society of america using fictional family, the corleone's, puzo spins a classic tale of love, hate , money , drugs , and the corrupt side of our country in the 1930's. when i first looked at the godfather in my schools library i just figured it was an ok book but when i could not set it down i knew that this book was going to live up to its ratings of an american classic."
4,a nice addition to the movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Godfather. A number of my questions were answered as to why some of the characters developed the way they did. However, a number of things are not explained. Puzo went into too much detail on minor characters; Jonnie Fontane, Lucy Mancini-Sonny's putana. Something like 5 chapters are devoted to this. Yet we don't get a reasonable explanation on why Michael Corleone transforms from college boy to Mafia Don. Fredo is also left out; Why is he such a wimp? The Sicilian background story with Michael in exile is very interesting because it gives some insight into the background of the Mafia. For me, the best part of the book.Definately worth having. Ciao."
4,A not-so realistic story of mob life,"I first read this novel over 20 years ago. Recently, I decided to read it again. My appraisal hasn't changed. This is one of thoserare examples in which the movie(s) is betterthan the book. There is no question the book ismasterfully crafted and written, but the characters of the Corleone family are so lackingin realism as to actually invite your sympathies.Puzo succeeds in making Don Corleone seemlike a guy you would'nt mind living next door to.The foul language and crude behavior of mafiahoods goes almost wholly unrecorded. More than anything, this is a revenge novel with astory base that could take place in any oldcornball western, the Corleones are painted asthe good guys, while all the other ""families"" arethe truly bad guys. In reality, all of them arevillains which the world be better off without"
4,Wonderful book!,"I was quiet fascinated with this book and I haven't seen the movie hence thought of buying it. I must confess it was amazing experience to read this book, different from the kind of books I usually read. The making of don Vito is really interesting. Tom Hagen the intelligent and witty lawyer, the don himself the mastermind create the grip required to hold the reader. Kudos to the author!!!!"
4,An Instant Classic,"Whew! I finally finished this book. I wish I had more time to read! I sound like a broken record.Anyway, Here's my review:This story follows The Corleones & Entourage through trials, & tribulations.It describes how The Don came to be & when one son dies another rises.In some ways, I prefer the movie to the book.I thought the movie had details the book did not, but yes, the book (always) gets into the mind of the characters/actors, which I like.Now, that I've read the book, I'll have to watch the movie again. :)"
5,A good book makes a good movie!,"The Godfather by Mario Puzo is without a doubt...a classic in every sense of the word. At first glance, the story revolves around the Corleone crime Family. Yet, it is much more than this. It is a story of a family and its struggles to accept itself and others. And not only is this a great book, but check out the movie too!"
5,Godfather,"I read this book in the 70's and love it, saw the films and they were great; however listening to this book on CD was not as good as reading it. I give it 5 stars because it is a great book and ifyou cannot read it you should listen to it and try and get the message it is saying in a violent storyline.I highly recommend."
5,Best lessons to learn for being prepared for real life,"If you want something - go and get it, period. Or make an offer they can't refuse..."
5,One of Puzo's best!,"I love this book, and is only rivaled by The Last Don...Omerta wasn't nearly as good as the other two."
5,Wow,"Quite Possibly The Greatest Book I Have Ever Read. The pinnacle of morality paradoxically combined with a stereotypical vice. Simply stated, this book is unbelievable. The movie does not even come close to depicting accurately the masterful work of Mario Puzo (and the movie is very very good). Read it. What more can I say?"
4,"An ""ok"" book","Since I like Civil War history, New Moon Rising was an ""ok"" book. But you would have to like Civil War history to even pick this book up. Because if your looking for a good romance novel this is not the book to read, because there's not much in the romance department in, New Moon Rising. But like I said, it was a fairly good book if you enjoy Civil War history."
5,Book as a gift,"I bought this book as a gift, and it was very much appreciated. The recipient enjoyed it very much."
5,Love it!,"Volkman produces the best seed mixes for birds that I've experienced, and Featherglow is my favorite. I couple this seed mix with natural colored Zupreem small parrot pellets and fresh produce for my lovebirds & cockatiel. Their feathers are strong, healthy, and brilliantly colored off of this diet. Their muscles are toned and their beaks and talons are in great shape. Diet is so important for the health of all creatures, but more so with birds since they are so hard to treat if/when they become ill. I would highly recommend any of the Volkman seed mixes as a part of any captive parrot's diet."
4,Great poems for yoga inspiration!,Danna's words are the perfect soul searching catalyst to end or begin a yoga class.
4,Relatable,"I haven't finished reading it yet, but love it so far. It also includes a story of how the author began writing which is very inspiring! :-)"
3,"excuse me Miss, what your man gotta do with me","I first got into Pos, back in the day when he got down with MC Ltye with the excuse miss joint, he had a decent flow, nice skills and when his solo joint dropped I had to scoop it up I gave this album 3 stars because the remixes that came out after the release were on point. (car hoppers and nightshift) featuring Big daddy kane are worth it alone. I'd recommend this to any real hip hop fan, at discount prices though."
3,gotta man was cool,this was thankfully positive k's first and last cd the song gotta man was good for a fwew laughs but still glad he's gone.
2,what has happened to buckshot?,"what has happened to buckshot? i have been the biggest bootcamp clik fan ever since blackmoon dropped enta da stage so everybody reading this i definitly know what i am talking about.first off the lyrically tight buckshot of the past has been replaced by this east coast wannabe 2pac. and why has the dark and gritty production of da beatminerz been replaced by this swizz wannabe commercial production? and you know why ""trapped"" and ""breath control"" are the only dope songs onthis album? becuase they are five years old and were made when buckshot was lyrically tight and wasn't trying to go extremely commercial on the production tip.i never wanted to bash a bootcamp album but buckshot betrayed his original fanbase and deserves it in my opinion.the repz,o.g.c., and the duckdown album were tight but this album isn't and comparing the bdi thug to enta da stage is like comparing juvenile to ras kass.peace"
1,very forgettable,"I just gave this one more try...terrible. I'll prob never listen to it again. Can't believe it was rereleased....the only way you'll like this is if you are 15 and think you are gangsta. Buck's much better in moderation, not carrying the whole show."
4,Definately worthy of a re-listen or to add to the collection!,"As a Black Moon fan I bought this new back in 1999 but originally only liked 4 tracks! However, I found myself buying this album again 10 years later and like all but 2 tracks #5 and #15. The reason I didn't like this back then is that I was expecting the Buckshot from 1993's ""Enta Da Stage"", but this album IMO is in-line with the 'Chemistry' and 'The Formula' LPs for quality music. Buckshot can still 'spit fire' and IS still relevant in the Hip Hop community with the Duck Down Record label. Peace and thanks to all the BCC and affiliates for staying underground and giving commercial rap the ""Gunn Clapp!"""
3,Average Bootcamp Album,"Straight up average release given the whole Boot Camp Clik catalogue. Unless Buckshot is one of your favorite MCs, this is not a must have. That said, there are some gems on here that you're not going to find anywhere else. Also cool to note that Ecko did all the design for the album artwork."
1,Buckshot shows no signs of freshness he once posessed.,"Obviously most of the people that have reviewed this album are the new era of ""thug"" fans, because original fans will see right through this attempt at a sellout album. Other than becoming an Ecko model, Buckshot, and the rest of BCC have completely fallen of in terms of beats (I miss that old Beatminerz style! ) and lyrics (he now has the Nas syndrome of trying to be like a east coast 2Pac)with all around lack of originality. With ""BDI Thug"", Buckshot seems more content sticking with bandwagon jumping, as opposed to coming fresh like he did back in '93. Only 2 tracks on this album knock, and it's only becuase they were old unreleased Black Moon tracks, from the early 90's. BCC hasn't come correct since Nocturnal, and at the rate they're going, it doesn't look like they ever will again. Everything since, including this sub-par album has been an unispired mess."
3,More for the hungry,"If you like this disc, pick up her followup solo disc. There's a couple really good songs on it. Angelique - Present."
3,Gotta know what you want to hear.,"I just got my second copy of this after my ex destroyed the first in a fit of delusional pique (directed at the world, not me or this cd). It's got some notable qualities:1. They know what to do with a Mellotron.2. They know how to sound peppy despite never hearing a major chord they like and relying almost exclusively on modulation to the diminished as the vocal hook.3. They play well and the songs are pretty catchy. See 1 and 2.4. I'm a sucker for a nice contralto, and so are you.However, the whole ""indianism"" thing is about as ignent and juvenile as you could possibly imagine. Ignore the lyrics unless you're emotionally 13 years old and/or think if you discovered Cherokee in your bloodline you'd need to be ""Soaring Hawk"" rather than ""Ambling Turtle."""
1,I Bought This Album For A Buck,"It wasn't worth it. I bought it because of `Look Up To The Sky', a track I knew from a sampler. That track is ok, if a little long, but the rest is boring. The singer sounds just like Natalie Merchant, but this is hardly a bonus, since it simply makes one mistake it for a bad Natalie Merchant album. The Indians mix Hip-Hop with folk like Beck or Folk Implosion but a much less interesting way. The bad rapping on `Love' is a good example. In general the album is lame but `Love' is god awful. I'm all in favor of protest songs, but this is just arrogant, preachy nonsense. Skip It."
4,Raw Southern Rock at it's finest,"These boys were young, but extremely talented. Jon Byrd has that SRV talent that so few six stringers have. With Tony doing the bass bangin', you are sure to tap your feet. This is a must have for any southern rock fan..!!"
3,Solid southern hard rock,"If you like southern rock (with a hard approach) in the shape of Blackfoot, Doc Holiday, Molly Hatchet and Lynyrd Skynard, I guess this album will be to your satisfaction. Copperhead bring on a good groove with rough vocals, and the most accurate comparison may be to the band The Regulators. It's not the easiest thing to describe Copperhead, but let's say if you are, or want to be a biker I think you might find the soundtrack to your life in the opening song ""Whiskey""."
4,More Emotions In This Album,"Out of all the albums of ATB, I think ""Dedicated"" was the best. Maybe a little emotional because it was dedicated to the people of 911. Unlike, his first two albums, I only liked tracks ""9PM (Till I Come)"", ""Dont Stop"" from ""Movin' Melodies"", and ""See U Again"" from ""Two Worlds"". The rest seem to put me to sleep. ""Dedicated"" is a lot different. You really get the feel of the music and relax your mind. I enjoyed just about every track, but the two tracks ""I Can't Stand"" and ""I See It"", the vocals tend to get on my nerves. ""Get High"" is my most favorite. Love the sound of it, very comfortable."
4,Nice Change of Pace,"Definitely different than the first two albums but if you're a purist when it comes to trance/electronica music, you can appreciate the range ATB has to offer in his music - a great combination of progressive and melodic trance on this album."
3,Where is the originality?,"I always associate ATB with something different. His music always has a distinguished ATB feel to it. Although his previous albums were also filled with this trance-cheesiness, they were still enjoyable and rather new to the scene. This almub however is rather boring, you know what to expect. The music style is rather retro, with cheesy female vocals and synth leads with a old school dance melody. What I have come to enjoy about trance music is its unity, you hear the music not the the separate samples as I do in this case. I like the progression, but why make it so obvious? Furthermore, the tracks are quite similar to each other and surely I like to listen to ones like Hold You, the others just dont seem enjoyable. This is not an album that will make you dance, nor is it very good to listen to in a car. But pick it up anyway, you may think differently..."
2,Lumpy Oatmeal,"As stated before, there's really nothing original or attention grabbing on this CD. It's kind of sad, because I'm a big fan of Andre's creations. Roberta's voice (Gal from Wild Strawberries) can be heard on every other track; she has a beautiful voice, but the lyrics don't do her justice. Let's just say, on ""Hero,"" it sounds like Roberta was nippin' in the sauce. If you want an ATB CD, go for Two Worlds- it flows a lot better, and the songs differ more than on Dedicated."
4,Step towards maturity,"I had to step in after reading those mediocre reviews! I agree that a majority of the album is filler, but the collaborations with the Wild Strawberries are fantastic. ATB has always veered towards the cheesy side, yet, with the unique vocals of Roberta Carter Harrison on ""Hold You,"" ""Let U Go,"" ""Hero"" and ""I Wanna Cry,"" the songs are the most mature work ATB's produced, and best of all, the tracks would fill any dance floor. My favourite track with Roberta has to be the remake of Olive's ""You're Not Alone."" Even though I'm a huge fan of Olive (Get their album ""Trickle"" everyone!), I have to say this one out does the original -- especially after the 3 minute mark when it just sizzles! Highly recommended, if only for the five tracks mentioned above."
5,Ivy cottage,I think this is best of his small series of books that this author has written. The stories are even more fun to read to small children if you have his rag dolls sitting beside you
3,a new take on some classic songs,"there seem to be no track listings yet so here goes: 1) Where Do I Begin (""Love Story"" theme) by awayTEAM 2) Goldfinger by Propellorheads 3) C'mon Baby Light My Fire by Kenny Dope 4) Diamonds Are Forever by Mantronik 5) Easy Thing To Do by Nightmares on Wax 6) Never Never Never by Groove Armada 7) Hey Big Spender by Wild Oscar 8) Spinning Wheel by DJ Spinna 9) C'mon Baby Light My Fire by Twelftree 10) If You Go Away by Moloko & Mark BrydonA bit of a mixed bag. The remixers worked with the original records, so most of them have left in the original orchestrations too and just added a techno rhythm, which works better for some (Moloko, Propellorheads) than others. It makes you realise once again what a fabulous voice Bassey had and still has. Full credit to her to allow her recordings to be remixed, hopefully creating a new generation of fans !"
4,Zinc Armarda's Thoughts on Chuck E. Weiss' Extremeley Cool,"Extremely cool to say the least. Compare it to Tom Waits? Well for a start there a lot more of Tom to dig and it depends entirely upon the genre of the Waits' album you're making the comparison with. Closing Time, Nighthawks at the Diner, Heart of Saturday Night are jazz albums entirely unlike Extremely Cool in anyway and therefore irrvevlant to comparison. Albums such as On the Nickel, Bone Machine, Rain Dogs and Foreign Affairs have got a lot more in common.Chuck E. Weiss and Tom Waits are both unbelievable cool artists.Buy their stuff. Buy it now. It will blow your mind, baby."
1,dullsville baby,"If there's anyone out there in the market for an album consisting of straight ahead rehash, this is it. Boring blues cliches, boring old time rocknroll cliches, pretentious poetry cliches: it's all here. I finally sat down to listen to it on the 'phones last night to see if I'd missed something in the first dozen or so listenings. Nope--there's nothing there. There's some pretty sharp musicianship here, a nicely ripped off bebop riff but basically this is a wasteland of stuff dredged up from the ash heap of the fifties rock and blues standard text. I'm amazed at both the cynicism of the record companies selling this thing as a product of ""Tom Waits' best friend"" and my own stupidity for falling for it. I'm sure Picasso had a best friend too but we don't hear much about him. The 18 year hiatus between Weiss' recording dates is no longer a mystery to me."
3,Just Curious?,"Does the fact that the ""customer reviews"" swing between the ultimate-exellent-classic-unbeatable 5 stars and the appalling-boring-wheatsoup 1 star strike anyone else as significant? Please, people, if your going to pen one of these things, take the time to consider. I was genuinely curious to see what people thought, and was genuinly disappointed to see that people didn't."
1,Disappointing,"One or two paragraphs each containing stats and awards. I was expecting more fleshed out biographies, perhaps outlining any adversities these folks had to endure, Jewish or otherwise. No or almost no personal information."
4,Real Energy,Shania has a high energy style that is sure to widen the audience of country music. Her music is the heart of her preformance;therefore she gives her all and leaves us wanting more.
3,"Not Shania's most creative, but vocally her best","Shain Twain's debut definately lacks creativity, not to mention the fun and sometimes nonsensical lyrics and in-your-face sex appeal that have made her so famous in both the country and pop markets today, but her voice sounded 1,000 times better! On her latest CD Up! ... Come On Over wasn't much better vocally. While she only penned one Song on the album ""God Ain't Gonna Getcha For That"", there are some good songs on the CD. She didn't write them but so what? Her voice is beautiful and she makes the songs her own. Not a CD for her crossover fans but for the true country fans, you won't be disappointed."
4,nice debut,"At first I was a bit disappointed with the sound of the this album because it is SO country, but then I realized that most of the songs on this album were not written by Shania Twain. The only song that was written by her was ""God Ain't Gonna Get You For That"".However, after listening to the album a few times, it is a really nice debut album."
2,NOT EVERYONE LIKES SHANIA,"I may be the only one in the world who doesn't like Shania. She's too harsh sounding for me. I gave this cd 2 stars because I like the wolf on the cover. I'd rather hear the howling wolf than Shania. Boo, Shania!"
5,Shania Twain CD,"This is a great CD, one of a great cluster that i have listened too. Delivery and sale were good and I would be happy to deal with the seller again, as well as buy other Shania Twain CD's. She is an excellent performer and singer!"
4,shania twain,I think this was a great album I new the others would be better and they are . She is great.
4,Does The Job!,Works great! I stringed two of these cables together to get my XM radio working in my office and I get a crystal clear reception in my office now. Works great!
5,Worked Great!,Received in a timely manner and worked well. This extension works well with either XM or Sirus. Amazon is a great company1
4,Better XM signal for indoor,The 20' cable provided with my Audiovox CNP2000H was not long enough. This cable allowed me to run the cable thru the basement and mount the antenna outside. My antenna had a 90 degree connector that connected to the extension cable that did not allow the rubber hood seal corretly. No problem for me since this connection was inside.
3,connector problem,I have a TAO XM2GO receiver and wanted to add an external antenna to not have the wire for the internal antenna in my way all the time. So I bought an XM6 roof antenna (TERK) and what was said to be a cable for XM Home Receivers (XM-EXT50) also by Terk. One gets no options or explanations as to what fits where and the cable will not connect to the XM6 if I use the other end to plug into the Tao. I either need a connector conversion plug or a different cable but who knows what that might be. I now find out the TAO isn't even being sold anymore. Nothing but trouble with all this electronic stuff being replaced every time yu turn around.
3,"Ok, Repeats concepts from grade 1.","My 7 year old, 2nd grader son seems to like the material.Primarily I think because it repeats concepts he knows well from 1st grade.So I'm good with the book."
4,Surprising number of recipes for its size.,"Russian Cooking contains a surprising diversity of Russian recipes for such a small book.A reprint of a book originally published in the 1960's, the commentary makes for interesting reading from a historic perspective. Take, for example, Mrs Howe's observations on the Soviet cooking environment, or her remarks on the use of sour cream (that reveal perhaps a hint of a typically anglo-saxon suspicion of soured dairy products that has since, largely, disappeared).Typographical errors make some of the recipes a little difficult to follow. Otherwise, a welcome addition to any collection on Russian food."
2,Cute at times,"A nice compendium of British slang, but a bit tedious that the author includes terms that are fairly common in the US, like nookie, nosh, piece of cake, puke, etc. Spend your quid elsewhere."
2,"Mildly entertaining, sometimes incorrect","If you haven't had any previous exposure to British English and are now subscribing to BBC America, this book might be occasionally helpful. I got the sense the author was somewhat traumatised by his 2 years in Austin. He certainly isn't a linguist - he didn't get all the comparable US usages correct, and even some British terms were imprecisely defined. And some of the entries were just personal rants. Really. (That's in case he reads this.)"
2,Too wild for my taste,"All I wanted was a basic strawberry smoothie recipie, but this book did not offer it. If you like wild and different flavors, than this is your book. Not for the basic smoothie drinks that I was hoping for."
3,Que esperas de Pandora?,"Mientras leía el libro, pensaba ""ok.. esto suena bien.. de seguro pronto llega la parte impactante...""Y desafortunadamente nunca llega esa parte.Basicamente trata de la historia de la vida de una mujer, y en el desenlace, su transformación a la vida vampirica...A lo que me refiero es que, por ejemplo, a Louis o a Lestat no les tomo mas de 50 paginas en contar como fueron transformados.. en cambio a Pandora, le toma alrededor de 250 paginas, y 50 mas son de sus conclusiones.Considero que es un libro aburrido y muy enfocado (en exceso) a los detalles de vestimenta y cultura de esa epoca, el cual pudo haber sido escrito en no mas de 100 hojas, con el mismo resultado.Si esperas encontrar algo de información de Marius (como yo esperaba), ni lo intentes.. Mejor compra el libro de Blood and Gold."
4,Hit And Miss,"Eagle When She Flies, Dolly's first album in the 90s, is a collection of songs that are hit and miss. The album does have its strong tracks (The soaring Eagle When She Flies, simple Silver and Gold, accepting type song Family, Dreams Do Come True, etc) but it falls short on some songs (What A Heartache, Best Woman Wins). This is still a nice album, as Dolly always releases quality music, she has the best voice in country music (even to date)."
3,Thank God for CD Writers,"Half the songs on this album get five stars. The rest don't merit one star. The great songs don't deserve a two stars and the horrid songs don't deserve four stars. So, there is a compromise of three stars.I heard Rocking Years and wanted the album. I heard Eagle When She Flies and my desired picked up. Then I heard Silver and Gold, and I had to have the album. Still, I've never listened to but a few notes of some of the songs, my hand automatically reaching to the forward button on my cd player. The great songs on this album make it worth your while. Just get a rewrittable CD and edit the others out."
1,Complicated recipes and expensive kitchen gadgets,"I did not find this book very helpful. There is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to ""invest"" in (it seems the pricier the better, and I mean several hundred dollars, I actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands) and what kind of fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals. I am not a professional chef, just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple, good-tasting meals for my family, the recipes here seem to be time-consuming and complicated. Not much money to be saved here!"
1,Not at all cheap!!!,"Unless maybe you are a single person who eats out at fancy resturants, and would like to consider this an alternative. Then again, that is if you could only understand half of the recipe directions! This book is the only ... thing you will be getting out of it. Not at all worth the money, (good thing I checked it out at the library before buying it), I would reccomend either The complete Tightwad Gazette, or Not Just Beans anytime before I would this book!!!!"
1,Want to waste your money? Buy this book...,"This format and the content of this book are tedious and unentertaining. Every single money saving tip in here can be obtained from internet frugal sites for free. And on top of that, the recipes are ridiculous. Not only are they not family friendly, you could blow your entire food budget for the week purchasing the speciality items to make just one of the meals. Want to feed your kids Sea Scallops, Pheasant and Prosciutto wrapped asparagus on the cheap? Well then you might buy this book? But if you want to cook these things on a regular basis anyway there are much better recipes and cookbooks out there for gourmet meals such as this so you've pretty much wasted your money anyway you go with this book."
1,Disappointed....,"I got this book from the library hoping to find some neat tips to save on groceries and kitchen items. This book gave me neither. It talks alot about how to cook gourmet type meals, not at all cheap. Not impressed with this book. I am glad I didn't order it."
5,If you want to take kettlebell training seriously...,"Once you've got the kettlebell bug, you are going to want every video out there about kettlebell training. These videos aren't flashy, but they are full of incredible content. Steve is a great teacher. He always emphasizes correct form and teaches things you just don't find on other videos. Honestly, this is a DVD you have to have in your collection."
5,THIS is What Kettlebells are all about!,"I have purchased many DVDs of kettlebells but Steve Cotter's Extreme KB Workout is one of the most thorough DVDs I own. One of the best. I have many, but use only a few on a regular on-going basis. This is one of them! I'll never go back to boring exercises that just don't work. Kettlebell workouts are the way to go. Having arthritis throughout my body, sometimes I have to modify a move, but I still do them. It's great for mobility and pain reduction, oh and did I mention I've lost 60 pounds? I wish I had all the money back on all the exercise junk I bought in the past. I'd spend it all on DVDs like this one!!"
2,You'll need 2 of all weights,"Nice to know before picking up the video. Will need to go buy another set of bells before I can get started. That, or get a different video I guess."
1,Delicate!,Not durable. The top side with the data easily comes off. They scratch easily. I tried to remove a removable label and it came off with a huge piece of the silver.
4,Nice CDs,Quality CDs at a very good price. Great to back up your songs and albums on and they come in a nice protective case.
1,First 10 BAD....not even going to waste time trying the remaining 40.....,"I would rate these Verbatim CD's a zero if possible. I had ordered the exact same product prior to this purchase and all 50 worked fine for burning music which was the only reason I bought them for. This pack, however, is so far a dud. The first 10 cd's burned fine from my laptop and played back fine, but would not play in other laptops, etc. I refuse to waste my time trying out the next 40 to see if they work. I will be choosing another brand when I re-order as it is not even worth the time to try and return this pack. I will not purchase these again."
1,AVOID - First 3 Discs Were Defective - Item Was Returned,"Just as the title says: avoid this purchase - my first 3 discs were defective, or my system could not write to them.Such a shame too - Verbatim use to be a respectable brand."
1,defective disks,10 disks were bad. That many per pack here are unacceptable. Each pack will differ of course. Apparently Verbatim's marketing plan is this balancing of customer risk against its costs.
1,"Says holds 80 minutes, Customer Service told me they're only for data",This is the only brand of CD I've found that won't work in my CD player in my car or my boom box or a clock/radio/cd player. It says right on each disc that it holds 80 minutes of audio. I called up customer service for a replacement under their lifetime warranty against defects. He told me that they're only made to work on the computer for data. Then why put 80 minutes on each disc? Worthless if you want to put audio on these.
1,DISSATISFIED,"We ordered two spindles. We've tried both. Sometimes they copy and sometimes they don't. It wastes our time. Will go with another brand in the future. I have had the same problems with these discs in the past. If I had remembered which ones they were, I never would have purchased them. It's not worth the inconvenience and cost of sending them back."
5,honest review,"I have used these for video, audio, pictures, boot discs and miscellaneous data storage. I haven't had any problems using them so far. They are better quality than other discs of the same price that I have used.Pros:Good productLow costReliable vendorCons:Plastic bad for environment?"
2,"Verbatim usually great, this product is not",I have always trusted Verbatim disc products and never had any problems with any other products made by Verbatim. I used several of these discs for mp3 files to use in my car's mp3 player. The songs skip to the point they are not worth listening to. I noticed that the CDs are practically see through. I am very disappointed with this purchase and I am not sure if I would trust Verbatim again. I would not trust this product for backing up important data.
2,doesnt work in my car,doesnt work in my car (which is the reason i bought it) and doesnt hold too many songs.... .. ..
1,Verbatim blank CD's,Purchased a while back and just now ran out of the old stock. Of the 100 cd's I have tried to burn 15 - only been able to get 2 to burn and then they will only play on the computer I burn them on. Will not play anywhere else. Cleaned the laser lens on my burner and did not change a thing. I read more good reviews than bad ones on this product....so I am wondering if I just got a bad run? DO I dare ask for a replacement? - UPDATE: I did ask for a replacement. Of course it was to late (past 30 days) for Amazon to do anything about it. Contacted Verbatim. Have to return at my expense - which would be nearly as much as I paid for product. Plus - even tho I told them it was CD-R's - they keep refering to the product as a drive and telling me to pack carefully to that nothing gets into the working parts! lol Go figure!
1,Not an item to purchase,"It should go, download music, burn disc and play but not with this product. It's download music, burn a Verbatim disc, hear nothing so burn again using a better product then play. I opened this too late after purchase for return but I will NEVER buy a Verbatim product again. Ever."
1,poor quality,"I had considerable problems with bad discs in this order. More than 10% were bad and, as a result, I wasted many more than that. I was trying to burn a play list over several discs and each time I inserted a bad one, I ended up having to start over, wasting the ones that had already burned and quite a bit of my time.Ultimately I was able to use only a little over half the package."
1,Terrible Product Don't Buy,I bought these to use with my Korg D3200 Studio recorder and my Apple Macbook Pro. Neither device is capable of burning to these Cdr's. Both pull up a media error while burning. One burn seemed to complete only to be unreadable by my cars Cd player. These are the only Cdr's I've ever had these problems with. Failed on 3 different devices. A total waste of money. Don't buy these!
3,Good but not good enough.,For every 100 there are at least 30-40 defective disc's. That's been my experience. I'm going to try Maxell now since I've heard they're more reliable. We'll see. For the price these are good but if you're paying for 100 CDR's you should be able to use 100 CDR's not 60 or 70. I've bought this 100 pack about three times now and have easily thrown out 100 cdr's. Time for a change.
3,a little bit of a letdown,"i bought these in hope of making some room on my laptop..not the brightest idea, but on a tight budget and with a vacation that i know i would take a ton of pictures during around the corner i needed something quick. when i tried to put my files on them, half of them didn't show up. might be my computer, my way of putting them on the discs, but whatever it was i was not completely impressed. great deal for the quantity bought though."
1,"Never got the correct item, sent Memorex instead...very disappointed. Still waiting on a resolve!","It was needed for a special occasion. I had to find a local store pay extra money that I thought I was going to save, then had to return because I needed on Verbatim brand ONLY!False ad, I guess. They claimed they found error too late...Poor business to me!"
1,"Horrible, cheap product","You get what you pay for. These were the cheapest CDRs I could find, and I fully regret buying them. They are very hard to get to play in my car's system, while other brand CDRs play right away. I will never buy Verbatim again!"
1,not so great,I have used 12 discs so far and 4 were 'corrupt' already. Telling me i only had 22 MB's on the empty disc.Kinda sucks
1,A total loss!,"After seeing the majority of favorable reviews for these, I bought them. A huge mistake. I have now burned 6 of the 50 as music CDs using my computer. The first three were given to a friend to play in her car -- none of the three would play. I burned the other three for myself. Although the CDs would play, some of the songs had a strange type of ""interference"" sound. It seemed to come up only on certain songs, and only in certain parts of the songs. Nonetheless, it is sufficiently distracting that neither I nor my kids want to listen to these CDs, which are all going to be thrown away. Although I should return the spindle (given that I'm batting 0 for 6), the hassle of packaging it and mailing it back isn't worth the time this will take, so I guess I'll just ""eat"" the $20. I wish I'd have listened to the reviewer who suggested buying Kodak. Although they are more expensive, I would've saved myself $20 and a lot of aggravation."
1,never got it,"Simply that, I ordered it in November and now it's January and i still haven't received it.......I just got tired and went to best buy....ridiculous"
1,Not Lightscribe ready,This item comes up under a lightscribe CD search. It is not lightscribe usable there is lettering all over the top of the CD. If you are looking to actually use the item with lightscribe this is not the one for you. I'm sure they are fine CDs for whatever else you are doing.
5,Great CD's,High quality CD-R's that record flawlessly. I've went through almost half of the spindle and all have recorded perfectly. My opinion is Verbatim CD-R's and DVD's are worth the few extra pennies it may cost to purchase them. My kids newer use these all the time on older and newer models of CD drives without a hitch.
1,Horrible...,"In all fairness, I simply gave these discs one star for each that ""sort of"" burned correctly. I've tried 5 of them. 2 failed during the burn. 2 won't play anywhere. 1 sort of plays, sometimes. What I mean by that is that there is constantly a fight to get a a player (tried 4 different ones) to recognize and play it. They were cheap, I'll give them that but they are absolutely useless. I've personally had a 80% failure rate. And to boot, they seem quite flimsy to me as well. Not sure how they'd hold up in the long run. Chances are I won't have that opportunity anyway. I simply cannot recommend these. Good for those who have had better luck. It happens though and I do generally like Verbatim products. I use their blank Blu-ray discs and those have been wonderful."
5,Great CD-R,They work great for listening to mp3 music in my car's cd player. I haven't had any burn errors yet. The packaging was very easy to open.
2,quality less than expected,"Some of these discs burn well, but the number that do not have issues with burning is far below what I expected. I recognize these are not ""top-of-the-line"" items, but I expected better than 50%. Out of the first 10 discs I burned, only 4 of them worked without skipping or some other issue. Some simply would not burn data. These are common issues, but the rate of failure is beyond what I would expect even in this price range."
4,Not much to say about them,"I prefer CD-R Blacks, but these are a good cheap alternative. I bought them almost two years ago and still have a few left, so I don't burn too many cds. I mostly use them for random mixes of music for the car, and they don't seem to be overly susceptible to scratches, but you still have to take care of them."
2,"May be my older CD players, but these are not great","So I am not sure if it's the age of my players, both my cars are 2002 models, but these CD-R start skipping way sooner than the previous spindle I had (that was probably 5 years old). Some of the CDs skip parts of songs immediately after they are burnt. And those that don't start skipping after the most minute scratches. I have older style CD R that are scratched to hell and back, and work just fine. So again, either it's an issue with my players and the ""newer"" CD R, or they are pretty crappy."
5,Shipping was fast!,"I was surprised on this order. The ease of everything was wonderful! This is the first time I have used the Verbatim, and I enjoy the quality of sound it delivers. Thanks!"
4,Reliable,"As always, these discs are reliable, affordable and worth the price. Verbatim makes great products. I buy theri DVD's and storage cases. All of them are quality items."
3,Takes the ink very well,"Takes the ink very well. No significant smudging if they stay dry the mat surface has a different texture then others I've used. Also, the printable surface covers more of the disc than others. The print programs I have are not set up for this."
3,Dissapointed,I've been buying these for a while seems they are getting to be not very dependable.Using with my stereo system cd burner i am getting about 30% bad disk rate.While ripping an LP I get a check disk error and have to toss the cd and start all over ripping the LP. Lots of lost time in trying to rip over 1000 LPs.
1,AWEFUL defect rate,"I recently purchased a spindle of Verbatim CD-R's and I was extremely disappointed at the defect rate. Of the 50 CD's on the spindle, I've used 37 and 10 have been defective, meaning unusable. Some wouldn't write at all and some would get half way through the writing process and then create errors that caused the write process to terminate. Upon inspection, some of the CD's had visible defects in the reflective surface. I've been burning CD's for many years now and have NEVER had this high a reject rate, or anything close to it. I visited Verbatim's web site to give them a piece of my mind and was displeased to discover they have no customer feedback tool on their site. This was my first purchase of Verbatim CD's and it will be my last."
5,Just as good as any other CD-R,"Excellent price for the quantity. Work fine for burning music, uploading pictures, etc. Highly recommend & will buy again."
5,These are ace!,"I bought two 50 disc spindles, and not one of them failed.It takes me about 2:30 minutes to burn one disc at 48x, which is great!I've used a lot of different brands, and my last 4 CD-R purchases have been Verbatim, and I have been consistently pleased with the products.I definitely recommend these discs."
1,I do not reccomend.,"Verbatim makes the greatest dvd+r dual layers but I guess they aren't so great with cd-r. I suppose I got a pack from the other manufacture.Burned audio cds only read properly on my computer, regardless of what speed I burn it at. In a stereo system, each track is very skippy. In my car, it sometimes plays fine but mostly errors out on initialization. When it finally does play, it sometimes skips.I've bought really cheap cd-rs before, and they are so much better than these. Unfortunate."
2,ATTN:Low burn success rate!,I bought this item and the success rate for cd writing is about 60% the remainder are not operable. I think that the company should sell 50 disc for the price of 30 because (for me)that is the success rate. When I spend money on something I should not expect a large percent of what I am paying for to not work.
1,terrible,"Most of the CD's in the pack was unusable, actually I have yet to find one that works in the remaining 80 discs or so. Can't believe it!!!"
1,Defective Garbage,"I bought these blank cd's after hearing so many good things about it. I should have done my research before I bought it because these disks are horrible. I went through 11 cd's in a row trying to burn some songs and none of them worked. They all had errors, and when it tried to burn, it would automatically stop and eject out of my computer. After the 11th failure I had enough and threw the 50 disc spindle in the garbage. I should have stuck with Maxell because I never had a problem with those. I'm purchasing a new batch of cd's from Maxell after I finish this review. Lesson of the day....don't buy this trash"
4,"Great Cd's , Great pricing !",these verbatim cd's are very good. Some brands always have a few that don't work we'll but I have not had any problems with the verbatim brand. I highly recommend these to anyone
1,30% of the CD's fail,"I bought a spindle of 50 of these blank discs. These are not good. I am only halfway through the spindle and have 7 ""duds"" already! (Windows Media Player cannot record them, while other CD ROM brands work 100%.) This is very disappointing."
4,Verbatim CD-Rs,"These blank CDs are among the best I have used. I have not experienced a failed burn (""coaster"") since I purchased these."
5,Verbatim cds,Arrived in time stated in excellent condition. Every CD was printable - no rejects. I will be reordering
2,broken,"Not sure if this is the fault of the shipping company or the seller, but when the package arrived, the spindle case was cracked and broken. It now only has one of three saftey lock tabs wroking. the others were broken before I opened the item."
2,Amazon Search Listed these discs as Lightscribe,I am disappointed with this purchase.... I guess it's my own fault but I searched specifically for Lightscribe cd's and this Verbatim package was listed within these search parameters. Not sure if I'm going to keep or return them. I guess from now on I'll have to double-check each item before ordering. This is the first Amazon purchase I've made in 3 years that I have been disappointed with.
1,CD NR = CD NOT RECORDABLE,"believe the warnings junk only half work error with cd or product writing capability , only time ive ever had issue with discs. now you have been warned , buy at your own risk"
5,Best brand,"Verbatim is the best brand in optical discs, they never let me down so far either in cd's or dvd's."
1,crap,"The first 6 CDs are just all failed. I had to trash all of them, and just tired of trying.. I thought it should by my computer's problem, but I tried the 7th one on my friend's PC and the 8th one on my friend's MacBook Pro, all failed.....Don't buy it!!"
1,awful,"Verbatim used to be a trusted name for me, but no more. Out of the first 15 discs, over half gave me coasters. Just awful. Stay away."
1,Danger you are not getting 94554 - you are getting 97458 FFP!,If you are shopping for Verbatim 94554 and you therefore select 94554 on your Amazon search - you get shunted to 97458. Many users agree that 94554 are much better discs. It think is a bad deal that Amazon is doing this. Hopefully this warning will help.
5,Works well 0 defects out of 50,"These CDs really suprised me, with more expensive brands I've used theres a pretty high percentage of defective CDs (kind of like a pack of pens from the dollar store only more expensive). No problems with these and thats saying a lot."
2,Disappointing,"When I use these, I have to make several copies of one audio file. So, using the exact same audio, program, and settings; two or three CDs will work fine and one or two will fail. If this continues for the rest of the spindle, we will likely purchase another brand next time."
5,Recordable CDs,Cheap and easy solution for archiving music and photos. Have not encountered any problems in writing or reading either from my iMac to a PC or visa-versa. No errors or quality issues encountered either.
4,Good product,Excellent product. However the packaging for this product is the worst of all the items I have ever ordered. My CD stack came in broken and I had no time to return it....
5,Excelent Disks,Verbatim makes the best disks in my opinion. I always buy their CDs and DVDs. Excellent prices and excellent quality.
5,Good performance,These CD-Rs are exactly what you are going to expect. The fail-rate was very low in my spindle and in previous purchases.
5,"Slower speed, but very consistant product","I've used Verbatim writable CDs in the past and found them to be a stableand consistent product. The ones I purchased recently were no exception.Excellent, stable and consistent CD-R that is also very easy to label witha permanent ""sharpie"" marker. Highly recommended and great value.I'm so impressed with them, I got two (2) more spindles today!!!!!!!!!"
5,works fine,i've seen some negative reviews on this product but i have no problems with it. works fine for me and the music comes through beautifully when i write my mp3s to it to play on my cd player.
5,Verbatim Optical Media is Top-Notch,What's there to say about CDs that hasn't already been said?Simply put I hold Verbatim optical media in very high regard. From CD-Rs to DVD-Rs I've used Verbatim for years with very few bad discs/coasters.I'm using my latest batch of CD-Rs for backups of specific data and these discs are excellent as usual even with burn speeds above 10x. I've used 35 discs from this spindle without a single bad write.The discs have a simple silver/platinum finish and are very easy to write on.Definitely recommended.
5,Good,"Good value and a reputable brand name. I would buy this product again, but price was the primary factor in my choosing of this product over other competitors."
1,Total waste of money!,"Of 7 CDs I've tried only 2 have burned and they don't even work. I love, or used to love Verbatim, but this is total crap."
4,packaging was a bit beat up,packaging was a bit beat up. That would be my only reason to give it a 4 instead of a 5.
4,Overall good,"I've used three 100 disc spindles at home with roughly a 10% failure rate over the past three years. At work, this is the brand that is primarly used and we've burned through thousands with probably the same failure rate also. For the price I would recommend purchasing these."
2,2 ot of 3 discs fail!,"Excellent product when they work. I have used 4 different PCs between work and home and I still get the same issues. Sometimes the PC will recognize the disc begin to burn and then fail during the process. Other-times the PC fails to even recognize a blank disc has been inserted. I have never had issues with Verbatim products in the past, this one makes me question their product reliability."
2,Defective CDs,"Wife ordered these and I hoped to have a good experience with these but for some reason my car cd player couldn't play any song past the 5th track and this happened consistently with 2 cds.My burner (macbook) and the player are the same, hence had to be the cd's. I have tried Sony and lots of other unnamed brands but never encountered this issue, hence had to return these. Hopefully this is a one off issue ..."
2,These Disks Are Defective,All the disks are defective. They all get a bubble on the printable side after I write to them. I've bought these before and had no problems. But these were a waste of money.
2,Terrible,I received it in a terrible condition.All the cases(4 of them) were broken.Thou the CDs were not scratched.
2,It was not what I ordered I needed CD-RW's For a sony burner,"I ordered CD-RW's to use o my Sony burner. These did not work and so I can only use them on my computer. And I do not need them there. I also wanted them to be able to print labels right on the CD's and there is writting all over them. I can't use these at all. Very , Very disappointed in this product."
1,Product Quality,"I received this Item today. But one question I would like to asking for Amazon is: What kind of these Recordable Disc you sent to me????????, I tried to burn data for 63 of these media but all were defected. I going to best buy to buy 25 pack of Memorex and working good. this is so bad for Amazon tried to made money on defected products, I thought. I bought a lots of thing this time from Amazon and now I feeling disappointed."
3,Better go for a cheaper product,I bought this one thinking that it is a rewritable CD But it is not. You can get a cheaper product with the same quality
4,Verbatim CD-R,Since you ask... It came poorly packaged for shipping. From shipping the base of the plastic case was broken off and the case cracked but the disks appear to be ok.
2,Made in India - Probably Not High Quality,I bought these because of Verbatim's previous good reputation. I usually use Taiyo Yudens and was hesitant to switch. But I took a chance and was burned. Many reviews around the web talk of the low quality of Moser Baer disks (which is the company in India that verbatim uses as its outsourcing for these cds and which is how Nero CD Speed identified these).If you have a choice...find some Taiyo Yudens and use those. I am burning music cds to distribute and I want to make sure that they are compatible on as many types of cd players as possible. I won't be able to use these for that purpose.It's hard to find good cd-rs. Please do your research!
1,Defective,"I have always used Verbatim CD-Rs, but this is the first time I've run into trouble. So far, I have gone through 10 CDs - zero have worked in my car, two have worked in my fiance's car, and ten of them have really pissed me off. Unfortunately, I did not test these out right after receiving, and now it looks as though the return window has passed. I'll pass on Verbatim next time."
5,The Best,"I have been using these discs for years. I have never had a bad one nor had any problems with them whatsoever. I burn music CD's and photo discs and send them to friends and family. Everyone has been able to play them on the various players and computers that they own. I won't buy anything else.People here who have reported problems may have gotten them from vendors other than direct from Amazon. There are counterfeit products out there, so always buy from a reputable dealer. Particularly, if the price seems too low, be suspicious."
3,CDs are only okay,"These cds are fine, but they do not work in my car. I am a fitness instructor, and it is easier to listen to music on cd as opposed to on an Ipod. I had to re-copy my cd onto another brand, which worked perfectly!"
5,"Verbatim 94554 700 MB 52x 80 Minute Branded Recordable Disc CD-R, 100-Disc Spindle","Verbatim 94554 700 MB 52x 80 Minute Branded Recordable Disc CD-R, 100-Disc Spindle excellent product quality copying and high storage capacity at a good price"
5,Exactly what you'd expect,"An excellent product, though the category could easily be a commodity. Fine for everything except certified ""Archival"" quality archives. Delivery was as expected as was the quality."
5,The Best,I go out of my way to buy the Verbatim CD-R. I distribute several hundred CDs with software each year and have zero media problems.
4,Really Nice Bike,"My Kettler Pulse Milano arrived in less than one week in perfect condition. It is a really well-crafted, light, and attractive bike. Even though I went for the 17"" frame, it is still a tad high for my legs.So, why only four stars? Because it was the most difficult bike to assemble I've experienced in my entire life! The directions do not cover this particular bike, so were little help. One of the tools required, a slim wrench, so-called a 'spanner', took half a day of roaming the planet to find. No one calls it a spanner. I finally found one at a Schwinn store, which charged $10 for this el cheapo item. I've been putting bikes together for 50 years, literally. I've never had a two-day ordeal like this.I canned the fenders. I don't like fenders anyway, and these looked like they might take another hour or so to get right.Don't get me wrong, this is a Really Nice Bike. But you might want to consider having a bike shop assemble it."
3,"The Station, Athos: Treasures and Men","The book was published in the late 1920s so the language is different but once I was used to it I found it to be interesting. In researching the location I found some videos from a realtively recent piece by the CBS program ""60 minutes"". That helped to set the mood, scene and give it more of a sense of reality. Book is well written and it is a shame the author did not live longer. This book was chosen for a club read and did provide some interesting discussion. The treasures the monks guard were later threatened by Hitler but he never did carry out his plan of looting the monasteries."
5,STOP READING THESE REVIEWS!,"It is indeed a BRILLIANT book. All the reviews written here are perfectly right when they praise the author for her ability to create a master piece. But these same reviews are more interesting for people who already read the book than for the ones who are about to. They tell too much of the story and spoil the best of it. Luckly, I read no reviews before reading the book and the delightment of being suprised by a very intruguing story was there for me."
4,Obsession and Schitzophrenia -- A Love Story?,"This book, while an encompassing work offiction taken alone, does push rather deeplyinto the frightening netherworld of dark obsessionand current notions of madness. Paul Michel, aFrench writer gone terribly ""insane,"" is thesubject of study for an English doctoral studentwho becomes much more than simply anacademic interest. It explores the relationshipbetween author and text, as well as the ratheruniversal theme of unadulterated love. Wellworth a read, especially if one is interested intheoretical areas regarding madness and art"
2,Impossible to take seriously,"Hegel writes a script for the Young and the Restless. Thin and unconvincing as a Romantic novel, unsatisfactory as a novel of ideas, and a non-starter as some other form of discourse (allegory, what have you).Mortal doings are the result of an owl flying at twilight. Spare me."
2,"Clumsy, ardent, inadvertantly comedic.","Patricia Duncker must have been trying to accomplish something with this book. The title announces her philosophical intentions. The themes of madness, love (both erotic and familial), and literature are ambitious. But Duncker wields all the subtlety of a freshman Women's Studies major or a self-conscious ""artiste,"" and the book is weighed down by festering obviousness. Heavy-handed dialogue meets heavy-handed symbolism meets predictably silly denouement.A.S. Byatt called HALLUCINATING FOUCAULT one of the best novels of the year. Cross her AND Patricia Duncker off of your lists."
4,LIke New Yorker Fiction,"Two of the three protagonists are graduate students of literature, the third is the French writer that one of them studies and then springs from a mental institution. Foucault is there as a shadow inspiration (constructions of madness and sex), but the novel itself is a good story, not a lit-crit labyrinth. The characters are rather exaggerated, and overall as a novel, I would rate it three stars (too tidy), but as a compulsive read, it gets four."
2,uhhh,"everyone says this album is bomb. maybe im just not cool enough to see it but it sure seems to me like the drummer totally lost his licks. its boring as ****, no wonder they're on warped tour."
4,Poison The Well Rules,"As you may know, I am a person that listens to metal and emo. This is a pretty decent CD from one of the masters of metalcore. That's right, they've been playing since '99. ""Apathy Is A Cold Body"" is a great track, as it darker than other screamo songs out there. ""Ghostchant"" is also a great track. Don't get me wrong. Pick this up if you like something that brutal and mellow. I don't just listen to stuff that is just screaming and a bunch of guitars playing notes that you just can't tag along with, such as Converge and Napalm Death. Both bands kick ass. I listen to the metalcore stuff, because bands need to prove that they aren't just a bunch of wild bands that just want your ears to bleed."
3,You Come Before You,"This was the first PTW cd I bought out of their collection, and i wasn't too impressed, then i bought Opposite of December and I have to say that is one of the best cd's i have bought. They seem to have more emotion in their early stages then they do now but i could be wrong, dont get me wrong i love the band and the new cd is good but it sounds like he changed his deepness of his voice and im just saying that I liked their older vocals and songs more than their newer. Just an opinion, but all in all, poison the well is an awesome band."
1,sad,Is it just me or did this genre of music become a cliched parody of itself before it even got big. F this band (except for their first album). Listen to Black Sabbath.
3,Weird huh?,"Well I bought this album after downloading the two demo songs off their website, and being disappointed by them. First of all if you are big fans of TFTR and OOD then you will be very upset to hear their new sound. I think the sound is not as dark, but more of a Hardcore(Hatebreed, Earthcrisis) attempt. The music in general is alot faster also. The lyrics are still good, but slightly different from the older albums. The older albums had lyrics that made you say what the hell is he talking about, but this album is more straight forward. My first opinion of the album was that PTW was trying to get onto MTV or something. Overall its not a bad album, just not as good as their older albums, and a dramatic change in sound from their older alubms."
3,A Disapointment,"I'm a fan of poisonthewell's earlier work and hardcore in general and expected alot out the new PTW cd. But i was greatly disappointed. It is still the usual heaviness of PTW and the cool switches between heavy and melodic but the cd seems to be too generic. It gets repetative and even boring at times. Its much like Teflon where nothing sticks to it, while not bad its not a memorable listen. I can't even think of a stand out track because they all seem too similar. It much like the state of hardcore right now. Too much repetition is going on with every song needing a breakdown and a fast trashy part, a long ""cool"" title and cool artwork. At some point hardcore has to go back to the songs and try to do things with a different twist. For those interested in a better cd than this one get Hopesfall-Satellite Years or Zao - Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest or even PTW's older stuff..."
1,welcome to power chord hell,"this band is overrated. the whole 2 times i listened to this album and their previous two albums, which i wasted my money on, i found they have more power chords than blink182. the are a shame to hardcore and anyone who actually knows anything about music. if you want some good techinical hardcore that will punch you in the face, listen to some Dillinger Escape Plan, Between The Buried and Me, ect. they are what hardcore really is all about. or if u dont want the in your face hardcore, you can down grade to something just as good like Every Time I Die, As I lay Dying, Atreyu, Killswitch Engage, or Darkest Hour or something along the lines of that.all i have to say is Poison the Well is just a loss of money. if you're into that kind of stuff, please by all means listen to some crap like Rufio or Nirvana.how dare anyone compare Dillinger to Poison the Well"
1,Ptw is not hardcore and they never were.,"Ptw is and always will be horrible no questions asks...Every single album this band has released has been a letdown. Im some one who loves metalcore and wheres the core or metal in ptw ? No where! This is music for posers who do not know how true metalcore or just plain hardcore truly sounds like so just skip this crap! All the songs on this album are awful! Don't waste your money on trash, laters!"
4,"Good, not as good as old PTW though.","This album actually is very underrated, i really enjoyed it. Poison the Well's sound has changed alot, especially Jeff's voice. I like how he screamed better before, but it's still not bad. This album is definitly not as good as Opposite of December or Tear From the Red, but it's still awesome. Standing out tracks for me are Ghostchant, The Opinionated are so Opinionated, and Apathy is a Cold Body."
1,YOU COME BEFORE SUCK,"I was a great fan of ptw when opposite of december came out, then i bought this and it is the worst ""hardcore"" album i have ever heard. pff hardcore, this sounds like what every new band is trying to do these days, except even worse. Everytime i die,ptw,same thing, basically any band on trustkill sounds tyhe same. trustkill sucks. but um don't buy this album unless you want karma to catch up with you and split your 2 year old in half with a tractor trailer"
1,disgusting....,"I can't think of many positives for this cd. To begin with, the cd is mere shadow of what they once were in the earlier albums. The emo elements completely override any semblance of hardcore and drive my stomach to a churning sickness. Awful. The song structure is weak, the riffs are weak. The album reeks of the filthy emo-core brand I see everywhere. Don't waste your money on this trash. The truly sad thing is I use to be a big fan of PtW, especially the first two albums. Tear from the red was tolerable at best, but this has crossed the line. I do recommend their first album to anyone who likes hardcore, but as for this album... I don't recommend it to anyone at all. Then again, I'm not to big on the whole hardcore movement to begin with, so I recommend forgetting the whole thing and buying an Opeth album."
2,I love PTW but what is this?,"PTW is amazing but ever since Opposite of December the band has not impressed me. This CD is missing all the things that are great about Opposite of December: the metal riffs, breakdowns, and off-rhythm timing. It is also very bland and boring written in a very predictable format with almost every song starting with a slow guitar intro and leading to a predictable progression. As much as I love PTW I did not like Tear from The Red and I really do not like this new CD at all."
2,Be sure to skip this one!,"Man what happened here?! This band used to be one of my favorites, but now they are just throwing together some bland dull songs on here. I thought Ghostchant and Meeting Again For the First Time were good at first but then they grew tiresome along with all the other songs on here. Like I side I enjoyed a couple of the songs at first thus the 2 star rating but other than that I am dissappointed with this band now."
2,why create noise,"whay happend here? do i want to spend money on the next PTW cd, this band before you come before you was on top of the world and i haven't talked to one person yet that has liked this cd that much at all, its just too soft and slow and no breakdowns exist in this band anymore, opposite of december couldn't have been better or tear from the red then we get this album, time to play frisbee, i'm out"
2,Sad but true,"I bought this album the day it came out, and threw it in my player waiting to hear something similar to the PTW classics that fueled my love for hardcore. Honestly, I only listened to the cd about five more times after that date. Two weeks ago I saw them in concert, and from a previous review somebody said they were promoting this album. They only played four songs from it, and the crowd was definitely not interested, so I dont know how in anyway they would call that promoting. They also played four songs from OOD and two from TFTR. This album should not be talked about when the conversation is about Poison the Well, all it does is kill their reputation. The biggest disappointment from this album to me, besides the whole thing, was the lyric change. Jeff could write some rad songs, some of them that had three or more meanings, but this album seems too rushed and simple. I really hope the next album changes, and they leave that label."
2,Oppisite of December is way better,"If you fell in love with Poison the Well through, ""Oppisite of December"" do yourself a favor and don't get this album. I know I was throughly dissappointed with it. I still love Poison the Well, but not for this CD"
1,not the same band,"If you are a fan of The opposite of December, or Tear from the red, do not waste your time on this album. It is not even close to the same band!"
1,hmm...,"Well, nothing much I can say... other then I give this CD 10 stars, the one star is there just so you'd read this review. This is the greatest work that Poison the Well has yet to offer. You have to listen to the Cd for awhile to totally understand how incredible it is. ... Jeffs voice has improved so much from TOoD to this. This is a complete work of art, think Hatebreed meets Coldplay!"
3,Good......but not the same,"There is much to be said about Poison the Well's new release 'You Come Before You'. As you would expect, the band has matured in their music. The music on this album is way different than in previous albums. It has good ideas and directions, but I feel that their could be more to it. The lack of breakdowns is my big turnoff from the album. How can there be Poison the Well without breakdowns?? O well, the cd is still worth getting if you are into hardcore or if you are a fan of PTW. Some goofy buttrock kids might even enjoy it."
5,An incredible album from an incredible band!,"This is one of the most impressive albums to come out this year. Poison The Well is a band that is always progressing their musical talent and sound with each new cd, and ""You Come Before You"" is no exception. PTW has a unique sound that blends all the intesity and energy of metalcore, with the melodic music and singing that helps create a perfect blend of genres. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good, unique music!!!"
3,Funny with no feasible ending...,Charlize does a great job at the character she plays in this black comedy. The ending is the problem. It's like the writers didn't finish the story so they just threw random events together for this half-assed ending.
5,smart!,"This is a simply terrific sleeper of a film--smart, unblinking, and deeply insightful. The casting and acting are first-rate. What a pleasant surprise . . . and experience."
4,Great acting!,"Quite a wonderful movie, but be prepared to have your emotions travel from one end of the stick to the other, watching Theron's character make her journey. It's not just the physical trip and its implications and misconceptions, but the excruciating journey of self-discovery while stuck in the haze (and maze) of an alcohol-induced fantasy world that will make you cringe and groan. The acting is truly great and the characters well defined--so much so that the movie ""took me in"", as though I was a part of it. This is not a comedy though--it should be in the drama section. I truly loved watching this film. Throughout the movie, more than anything else, I just wanted to rescue that dog!"
1,This was one of the worse movies I ever seen...,My title says it all and there is nothing more to be said. You will be sadly disappointed if you watch this movie.
1,Snore fest,"Not funny or even interesting. The characters are weak, the writing is lame and the fact that they beat a good Teenage Fanclub song into the ground annoys me. Not worth the 1.5 hours."
1,Ugh,I hated this movie. I..hated...this movie. I would rather watch rust...rusting than to watch this movie. As a matter of fact I turned it off after only twenty minutes of watching it. It's a good thing that I only spent a dollar at Red Box. I wouldn't waste my money on this if I was you. Charlize Theron could do better than this. Highly disappointed.
4,I really liked this movie,"It won't make you feel great about the world, about your generation or about society in general, but it's an honest story and doesn't hide it's scars. As someone who grew up in a small city, moved to a bigger city and then came back, I could totally relate. Though I was more the Patton Oswalt character, rather than Theron's. Definitely not for everyone I suppose, but I say give it a chance."
2,Young adult,"Young Adult. i just could not get into this movie. I ended up not even finishing it, I was so bored."
2,People try to defend this,"by suggesting it is a dark comedy, suggesting those that didn't like it as simpletons incapable of understanding the depths of the cinematic writing genius at work. Those people are the sister of the cripple who got beat up in high school and if you watch this movie you'll understand what I mean. Plainly, this movie is rewarding only in the last 12-22 minutes which you can safely skip right too and watch and you will not have missed a thing. That's all I would recommend you do. Otherwise, the only other reason to watch is because Theron is actually so damn hot just like you want her to be, but she's mine.. one day she'll see."
3,It was ok,Charlize Theron did a good job being a crazy ex girlfriend. But the story was ok. She goes back to her hometown to try to get her ex who is married and has a newborn.
1,Worst movie of my ENTIRE life!!!,Horrible.... Couldn't even force myself to finish it.... Do not waste your time. I can honestly say that it was just not something I would even consider watching for monetary compensation. It was just endlessly painful.
2,really bad,"i just watched this right now, and i have been wanting to watch it since it came out in theater `s but i am so glad i didnt, it was just that bad!"
1,really bad,Not sure what is funny about this movie - character is pitiful and depressing. Really tough to watch and I didn't laugh once.
3,Patton Oswalt is the only thing that makes this movie watchable,"I somehow thought this would be funny. It was marked as a comedy. Charleze Theron's character is a petty, teenage-minded, shallow person that goes on a delusional quest to win back her ex, who is now married with a new baby, then is eventually shown that she doesn't give a *poo* about those people anyway... what the...?? There's a couple moments where she thinks about taking the first of maybe a dozen steps, then returns to her drunken depression. I expected some sort of growth, or realization. Really the movie was pretty bleak and borderline unbearable until Patton Oswalt showed up. The ending puts her right back to where she started. Yuk."
3,I really liked this movie,"I really wanted to see this movie based on the mixed reviews, simply because it was a story about a very flawed person.It's hard to watch and in a way doesn't make sense that someone would do what she does even being a hard core alcoholic which is clearly what she is.I would still recommend it. The disabled guy is really really good.It's about how life is what you make of it or think of it.How you look at your own fortune."
3,"Well ... it was MUCH better than ""Bad Teacher""","This got a lot of positive reviews and while both Theron and Patton Oswalt are superb in this and it certainly is a major improvement from writer Diablo Cody's last film (the downright horribleJennifer's Body (Unrated)), there's not much that impressed me. One critic said that some characters don't change, and that rule is OK for minor or supporting characters, but when your lead character/protagonist learns absolutely nothing from the past two hours (hour and a half), then the viewer is left to wonder why they even watched a film that went nowhere in the first place. While this was a definite step-up fromBad Teacher (Unrated Edition)(didn't you know? Bad girls were SO in this past year?!), it's still not enough to earn the acclaim that it's received. The best thing about this movie (besides the acting) was Mavis' (Theron's) meltdown near the end of the film. REALLY well-done!"
1,Waste of time,The most depressing movie ever. Depressing and disturbing throughout the whole movie and ended even more depressing. Don't wait for a happy ending in this movie.
2,A Waste of Charlize's Talent,This movie was a waste of Charlize's talent. It had a cute storyline which could have been so much better but it went no where fast. The scene with her and the fat guy doing it was gross and unbelievable. The ending was flat - as if the movie maker also just wanted it to be over. So glad this was a free rental.
1,Waste of my time,"This movie was ridiculous! A complete waste of my time. I actually feel dumber for watching it. A completely worthless plot line, and it just drags on and on... Not a feel good movie at all. Don't waste your time."
2,Total Physco,"Yes this lady is physco, and you are trying to figure out what she is really trying to achieve. It was funny, and odd at the same time. Probably a waist of time."
1,Awful,Only gave it one star because there is no option for zero. Horrible movie. Mean and dark. Waste of time.
2,One joke movie,Not as good as I hoped. The scene at hotel check in was the best of the movie.Charlize was in character but the movie was just a downer.
2,"lazy writing, among other problems","Too bad that the cast was wasted in this film. The premise is silly: a woman whose book series is faltering wants to go back to her hometown and try to take an old flame away from his wife and baby. Right. Yeah. She is so unsympathetic that it is hard to feel for her even when she finally comes to her senses, more or less.Looks like Cody was being lazy this time around."
4,Perfect definition of a Dramedy,"I was quite happy with the way this film turned out. Diablo Cody has always interested me as a writer. I was a big fan of Juno, and say what you will, but Jennifer's Body was a very different and fun horror movie. This was more of a serious style with her own twist on it. I thought the plot was very interesting and there wasn't a dull moment throughout the movie. Charlize Theron was both excellent and stunning throughout the movie. She played this role to near perfection and was very believable. She is also a perfect example of getting better with age. Absolutely beautiful! The rest of the cast did a fairly good job in their roles as well. Patton Oswalt was awesome playing Matt, an old classmate of hers. He was hilarious and was also very believable. This is definitely one of those not known films that will grow bigger as the word gets out."
2,borrriiinnnggg,"SoOO boring... it was barely worth my multi tasking time... It has no real plot and makes me confused as to why rotten tomatoes gave it such a high score... Anyways, my two cents? Waste of time. Especially if you just wanna watch something fun. It's got maybe one? or two? haha lines, and very anticlimatic. Very predictable."
1,bad,"Marketed as a comedy, but nothing is really funny. It tries to be a dark comedy but fails by just making you depressed. The character she plays is stupid and doesn't really have any admirable qualities, so there is no reason to care for her..."
1,Not worth it.,Disappointing. Wasn't enough good character development for me. I never really cared for the protagonist and what would happen to her.
4,Out of the ordinary.,The first 45 minutes of the movie the Mavis character gets redundant as the movie rubs her neurosis in your face so hard you begin to believe that Charlize Theron is not beautiful (this takes time to develop). The second half of the movie falls short of redeeming the protagonist but does make her human. Overall the film was enjoyable.
5,No Small town Redemption,"I love this movie. If people go into it understanding it's a black comedy and critical of small town life. the character is not lovable and isn't ""redeemed"" by the end of the movie; she is who she is and doesn't change for the people of her small-time town. If you want that, go see ""Sweet Home Alabama"""
2,Slow and boring!,"We didn't like this movie. Slow, boring, and depressing. I hope this isn't rated well by others. The chick in this movie is crazy!"
2,WOW...Really Crappy Movie!!!,I love Charlize but this really is a bad movie.She is too talented to waste her time with crap like this...oh wait...she made millions but it was actually me who wasted my time! LOLDon't even bother with DVD rental or for that matter late nite re-runs!I gave it 2 stars only because the acting was good. That can't carry a bad story though.
1,AWFUL.,The entire movie my friends and I were waiting for it to pick up or get better. It didn't. Don't waste your money or time on this one.
1,See the Trailer,"I'm not kidding. Cody wrote this movie for the trailer, all the funny parts are found in the trailer. Again another movie with no story, the protagonist doesn't change from beginning to end, she's despicable in the beginning, in the middle and in the end. I didn't have any sympathy for her, I didn't relate to her. I found her to be a self-indulgent, spoiled pathetic one dimensional. What was the point of even making this visual monstrosity? Since I don't watch the idiot box I'm not used to vapid meaningless visuals that pass for stories these days..."
1,STUPID,Please do not waste your time on this movie. It's 1.5 hours of my life I can't get back. I'm surprised that she would even agree to do a movie like this. Bad movie. Ugh.
2,"Good acting, horrible plot","Good acting, horrible plot. The main character was cruel, bitter, vindictive, and entitled. I could not raise any shred of empathy or sympathy for the protagonist. I kept watching it, hoping for an amazing ending that would redeem the mean girl from her self-serving universe. Nope. I was sorely disappointed in this flick. There's almost two hours of my life I won't get back."
1,Such a bad movie,When bad things happen to good actors. Don't waste your time. You have to care at least a LITTLE about the main character and this one won't make that happen. Watched the whole thing waiting for it to improve but it fished as badly as it started.
3,Good free movie to watch!,"Charlize did a great job in the role she played, but I did not care too much for the ending. It ended with a lot of questions for me. All I could do was imagine that maybe she got help at some point or not and would continue to think she's ok after her talk with her high school friend's sister....????? Entertaining though.."
3,Okay story.,I think she was rather obnoxious but I watched to the end to see what happened to her! My 2 cents.
2,Waste of Time,Story of a pathetic woman who at the end of the movie is still pathetic. Moves slowly and is not funny or touching.
2,Wow What Garbage,I thought it was going to be a dry humor kind of funny but even then i was disappointed. The nly reason i kept watching was because Patton Oswalt was a great character addition.
2,Too Adolescent For Me,"So many problems, and too few solutions make this movie tedious and difficult to enjoy. I liked the actors, who performed admirably. But I cringed and flinched watching the outrageous and adolescent behavior exhibited by the main character especially."
4,Gritty,"As always, Charlize delivers a well thought, emotional (not operatic) performance. The subject is uncomfortable at times (who doesn't cringe at a social faux pas), but the ending is awesome, and perhaps a lesson to some. She is gorgeous and sexy in this movie. Worth a look."
3,"If you like feeling uncomfortable, this movie is for you.","Although some parts were oddly funny, it was like watching a train wreck; all I could think was ""Do people really act this way""?"
4,Admirably unlikable.,"Charlize Theron gives a warts and all performance as history's greatest monster, a narcissist named Mavis. Diablo Cody's script is well-written and sharply observant. Jason Reitman gets good performances from everyone and knows where to set the camera."
2,Patton Oswalt Steals The Show,"Diablo Cody writes about alcoholism in a way unseen in movies. She is the Auteur of a tripped out beauty queen who wants to go back to high school and her boy friend, who is married with a kid. His new wife feels sorry for her and it explodes. Patton Oswalt is a star finally. Theron called in this role."
2,Okay,It was kinda funny and most can relate a little but too slow and drawn out. Only if you are bored.
3,Meh,"It is nothing special really. I probably wouldn't watch it a second time, but it wasn't necessarily a bad movie."
3,It's okay!,It was just ok! It didn't make the female gender look very good. She looked like a fool for her age.
2,A child could have wriiten a better script,Don't waste your time on this one. I didn't see anything in this film worth wasting the money making it.
1,Bad,"I really like Charlize Theron, but the movie was so boring that I didn't even finish it. Not worth watching"
1,pretty bad,"This is awful- slow to start and kept getting worse- I am a total Charlize Theron fan- very disappointed, could not wait for it to end."
1,Ham Fisted Script and Bad Acting,"Wow, this really never takes off at all. Depressing and half acted melancholy boredom. Patton Oswald is wasted in his role, but he is the best part of this film. Unlikable people and a very unlikable script.Disappointed."
1,It is just not funny,"Went to this movie with a lot of great expectations, especially after watching Theron in an interview where she talks about doing comedy was a lot of fun.This movie is not funny. The subject matter is not funny. I find it interesting when someone does comedy that most people think is not funny they call it dark humor. This is not dark humor, it is just a dark, sad movie. This is about watching someone who has some serious mental issues continue down a very dark road. Near the end of the movie you find out what is the cause for the major mental issues and it is not a funny / humorous cause in any way shape or form.At the end of the movie, there are no answers and no resolution. You may say that is fine because that is how life can be. This is the sad truth, which is why I go to movies so I can escape the cruel world for a couple of hours. You will leave this movie depressed in a lot of ways."
1,siskel & ebert give it 2 thumbs up,this film is a family classic favorite. while watching it we were reminded of of such blockbusters such as the wizard of oz and fargo.my family were inspired by the action and the adventures of the jador dior. NOT!!!!reading the toilet bowl comments truely made watching this movie worth while.watch paint dry while jumpping a pile of rocks hoping for a snake wouldve been more thrilling.It was like watching a bad car crash that you couldnt turn away from.
1,Bad Just bad,"The title says it all, This was just a waste of my life and my GF's life as well.. We watched the entire movie (to my regret) and with the ending I knew deep down within I would never get that hour and something back from seeing this film. Give it pass or read the other reviewers who deem this as a Horrible film. I cant be the only one who thinks this."
1,slow,"I watched this movie expecting to see Charlize Theron magic. It never picks up in interest, character development is weak, moral is non-existent, and the ending is unfulfilling."
1,depressing,"it's been months since we watched this move, yet still, just the mere glance of the cover makes me cringe into a downward spiral of depression ..... the acting was good I suppose but the storyline was depressing and gloomy. And I L-O-V-E Patton Oswalt but I have a permanent brain scar from seeing his shriveled, naked body parts on camera. Watching this movie felt like being stuck overnight in a dreary MInnesota airport with no coffee and no Internet."
2,Not the greatest,"I watch movies purely for entertainment and don't worry much about who directed it etc.This movie was really slow, boring, and character development wasn't great. I found myself picking up a word search and doing other things while watching.I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Life of a Sociopath= better title?,"The main character is a sociopath. She is everyone you hated in high school and every girl you ever meet and instantly dislike now. I wish a bus ran her over or she fell off a cliff the entire movie. If you didn't know what a sociopath is, watch the movie and you will now!"
2,Boring,"Once again the description of the moving before renting was inconclusive. I had heard good and bad reports, most bad, but thought I would give it a try. I should not have."
2,Not so great,"Supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find much humor. Just another of these self-indulgent looks at someone who is still pining for the glory days of high school."
4,Very engaging!,"This is a great movie! I really liked it. It was super engaging, it just pulled me right in. I forgot I had a life for an hour and a half. I'm from a small town, and moved to the big city. So, I can really related to this movie. The acting was really good. I hope Charlize Theron gets an Oscar."
2,Wha...who...why??,"This is not a ""comedy."" Anyone using that word should a.) examine the definition of comedy - dark or otherwise or b.) get some counseling. Very little amusing in this pretentious chracter study. The acting is fine, but no one is realy likeable or given much depth. WAY too much is spoken and not enough is shown. Cody and Reitman are critic darlings, but this film is just wholly flat and leaves you wanting something - anything - more."
2,Not worth the time,"My boyfriend and I purchased this movie thinking it would be cute or funny, at least good since Charlize Theron is in it. I wish I would have known this was a dark comedy, if you could call it a comedy. Don't waste your time on it as the plot is slow and the ending leaves you dissatisfied."
3,A very different movie,I know too many people like this-almost making bad behavior and narcicism ok. Charlize Theron is underrated as an actress.
1,terrible,"i kept watching it because i thought/hoped that there would be something learned by the shallow, narcissistic former prom queen who never grew up. nope. glad it was at least free with prime."
1,Not a Comedy,This is hardly a comedy. This was a big waste of time. There was no resolve at the end that made up for how awful Charlize Theron's character was. I would recommend watching anything but this. It was thoroughly depressing.
3,"Artsy, dark comedy",If you like odd dark comedies which have a bigger meaning...then this movie is for you. I laughed and cried. I thought it was a cool piece of work and well done on all accounts.
3,Not bad for what it is,"It's a pretty good movie over all, has some great acting by Patton Oswalt and Charlize Theron is pretty good as well. The story takes a sort of twist at the end that not everyone might enjoy. The biggest issue I would have with this movie is the advertisements for it. This seem to be billed as a crazy comedy movie like Bridesmaids or Hangover II that came out that year. Instead this is a more thoughtful movie and much more of a drama with comedic elements than a straight comedy. Insightful at times and funny at others but overall leaving you feeling more introspective than like you had a good belly laugh."
2,Uncomfortable,This movie was by far one of the most uncomfortable watches I have ever had to endure. To label it as a comedy (even a dark one) is a sick joke. Charlize does a phenomenal job at portraying a train wreck of a writer who has not mentally or emotionally progressed from her prom queen days in her po-dunk town. Unfortunately this train wreck is one I consistently found myself redirecting my view or making excuses to exit the room because of the sheer level of discomfort her encounters evoked. To keep this brief and to the point: just watch a different movie.
2,Very disappointing.,Charlize....wanted to like it. Seemed from trailer to have a decent enough plot line to develop but then I watched the movie and it was close to a big fat nothing. Even Charlize in full dress was not enough to save this. Perhaps written for women?? I do not recommend.
2,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but pretty close",One thing you can say about Charlize Theron- she doesn't mind doing ugly. This movie is just depression in cinematic format. I kept waiting for... something. It never happened. I could have turned off the movie 20 minutes in and not have missed much.
1,Terrible,"Hoping that the movie would turn around and take a good turn, I've realized that it must be one of THE worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching. Although the acting was par, the movie plot was terrible. I'd save my time and find something else if I were you!"
4,-,"Unexpectedly good movie, with very good performances by Charlize and Patton. Charlize draws the viewer in, as her story unfolds. A seemingly unbelievable story, but as the movie unfolds it shows the harsh realities of life in some people's lives."
2,You can live at home,"Surprisingly unspectacular for a Mission: Impossible film. I'd feel kind of cheated if I paid the evening IMAX price. The sequence in the tall building is impressive, but is only a short part of the film. The climax fight in the pigeonhole parking garage was done better fifty six years ago in a film that most of the people who saw it are now dead, called 5 Against the House. The plot seems like a mishmash of Thunderball andThe Spy Who Loved Me (James Bond Novels). The high praise this film received from critics makes me wonder ifCars 2is actually good."
4,Another impressive performance by Charlize Theron,"Due to the fact that there was a limited screening of ""Young Adult"" in the theaters, I wasn't able to watch this movie locally. So, like most people, I had to wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray/DVD. Charlize Theron plays an ghostwriter of a once-popular teenage book series who attempts to rekindle an old flame from high school. I don't want to spoil the plot for those of you who are planning to purchase this movie so I won't go much further, but rest assured that Charlize Theron absolutely nails her role and her performance is reason enough to purchase this movie (I being a big fan of her's). I enjoyed watching her performance in this movie and that alone is reason enough to buy and watch this movie. I'm sure the Academy will be calling her once again."
4,Awesome Movie,This movie was better than i thought it would be. i thought that it was kinda funny. i was surprised to see patton oswalt in this movie. i thought he was pretty good. i still like him from king of queens. charlize theron was excellent playing a stalker ex girlfriend that was pretty funny. i think this movie has a little truth into it. about ex's stalking there ex's. but all in all this movie was pretty good. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
1,Don't waste your time.,"Practically 2 hours of my life is gone. I understood the plot but it wasn't funny like it claims. At least it was free. If you like watching a grown woman ruin her life with alcohol and a relationship that's never going to happen, this is the movie for you. Take this as you will."
2,Funny and irritating,"Everything is perfect about this movie but I couldn't like it. The characters are sharp and realistic, every detail is taken care of, the story flows, and it's a harsh comedy on those stuck in the past. This movie's flaw is that watching it was like hanging out with any of several people that I used to know and don't like much. I got some laughs but I rather would have been doing something else."
1,Follow the majority of the reviews.,I wish I had paid attention to all the negative reviews for this movie. If I had I could have saved my time and money. The plot was painful to get through. Choose another moview that would be worth your time.
1,Terrible Movie!,Not worth the money or the time spent watching it. I do not recommend it. I like her as a general rule but not in this movie.
1,Rather go to Dentist,She is great actress. How did she stoop so low to do a movie like. There wasn't even 5 minutes of this movie worth watching.
1,Waste Of Time ~ Waste of $$,"This movie was horrible! I was so boring I couldn't even make it through the entire movie, even though I tried four times. I wouldn't recommend it to others. Really drags on... I'm so glad I didn't see it in the theater like I wanted too!"
5,Top notch!,"This movie tells the story of a woman who was once the most popular girl in high school, now a bit down on her luck, returning to her hometown, attempting to reconnect with a now-married ex-boyfriend. While there, she befriends another former acquaintance, a nerdy guy from her school to whom she would not have given the time of day as a teenager. This is a well-written and well-acted story of a lady trying to recapture her best years and perhaps hook-up with a guy that she regrets not having in her life. Screenwriter Diablo Cody is at the top of her game, telling a story that is funny, clever, and emotional and will touch a nerve with varying members of the audience. Don't miss this one."
3,Thought it would be more funny,"It had its OK moments, but the script was lackluster. The actors did a good job, but the plot failed to hook you much and a lot of the ""twists"" were predictable."
1,sucked,"It wasn't very good. the ""humor"" they where trying to do failed horribly. Do not waste your time or money."
2,Not my favorite,I love Charlize Theron but I just did not really care for this movie. I would not put it on my must see list.
1,I don't like it,"It's a waste of time. I don't like the story, nothing interesting, and it's just plain boring. The whole movie has no spark, no surprise, no climax."
3,Interesting,Chralize's character's life is screwed up and she has some terrible morals in the film. I think I kept watching to see how far rock bottom she gets. Patton Oswalt does well picking up the mood in many points of the film.
2,A Major Disappointment,"A major disappointment.I loved the film Juno by Diablo Cody and looked forward to being entertained after reading all of the great reviews for this film, but once again, you simply can't trust the critics reviews.Theron is good in whatever role she plays and this is no exception, but the story is bleak and pathetic and I found very little humor in the story. The encounter in checking into the hotel was the only moment where I actually laughed."
5,fun movie,"perfect movie for one of those night where you just want to be entertained without having to think too much... she's also a good actress, so... there you have it!"
2,This is not a comedy,I like Charlize Theron and I like comedies so didn't hesitate to rent this when I wanted a good fun movie. This is not a comedy. If it were in the drama section I would give it three stars but as a comedy it had the opposite effect for our household. Depressing and Dark. Move it to the drama section please so fewer viewers are disappointed in the movie.
2,Bad Movie,Kinda slow and not much plot other than somebody trying to get an old boyfriend back.......Would probably not recommend.
1,Ugh,Couldn't even finish watching this horrible movie. Acting horrible. Movie is very slow paced. Unlikable characters. Very disappointing. Glad it was free to watch.
2,Not good,Boring...plot was not interesting!. Thought it was going to be better but I almost fell asleep. Please don't waste your time.
4,"Good movie, bad ending.",Sad character tries to capture the past. Then she drinks a lot. Couple of car crashes later she is back where she started. Worth watching if you like Theron.
2,Didn't leave me with anything . . .,". . . except the knowledge that there may be adults out there who still long for their high school days and lovers but refuse to admit it. Sorry, didn't even find this one entertaining."
5,"Really sad, but everyone can relate","I always wondered what happens to mean girls as they grow up through the years. Looking at social networking sites now, I get the answer! They have either found ""God"" and bear children or they drink ALOT which you can tell due to their aging faces. Not cute anymore huh? Charlize's character Mavis in this movie went the way of booze and never growing out of her incredulous teenager. This is where it gets sad, enter Patton Oswalt and his emasculated and trauma carrying character. His character is what brings life to this movie he's the protagonist to the Mavis antagonist. This movie left me with a weird feeling that loomed long after I left the theatre. It brings back high school memories and all its extremes, the good and the bad. This is the first movie that shows it with brutal and awkward honesty. Thank you Ms. Cody!"
1,DVDs do not play on my player,I have bought many DVDs on amazon and unfortunately 80% of them do not play on my brand new Samsung player. This is really unfortunate and frustrating as I earn amazon points at my place of employment and can only buy DVDs as other items do not ship to my country. Make sure you double check the region on the back of the DVD cover and fine print.
1,Awkward!,"This movie was slow, dumb, and awkward. We've all been whiteness to the egotistical, crazy, and still stuck in high school ex popular person. I didn't feel like this movie portrayed that. This movie is called ""Young adult,"" and really should be named, ""Crazy, dumped, and needs to go straight to rehab."" Just sayin' not worth the watch."
1,painfull,"I just couldn't get into this movie.Charlize Theron is a great actress and she does well here, but it just doesn't help.This person just goes from one train wreck action to another without any resolution.So if you just want to see someone have a melt down and pity themselves for 2 hours, this is the movie for you.If you want to see how real life can make a bad movie, this is the movie for you."
1,Charlize Theron... in possibly her worst role yet.,"I paid 1.99 for this movie... Which was about 1.98 too much. The movie has no real plot, no real conclusion, and no real good acting. It was a disaster on about every single level.The movie centers around Charlize Theron, a depressed, dysfunctional, slightly whacked writer who leaves her apartment in Minneapolis to go back to her small town and win back an old flame, who is now married with a wife and newborn baby.... In theory, this movie could have worked, been filled with lots of witty, funny commentary, etc..... But somewhere it went horribly, horribly wrong. It barely touched comedy, the plot was too thin to really qualify as drama.... This movie belongs in its own category of "" Hot mess"".I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Comedy??? Not!,"I brought this movie home looking for a good laugh. There were none. I did not see any comedy in this train-wreck. Actually it was quite sad. Don't rent this movie looking for a good comedy. This movie does not have anything funny in it. I don't see the humor in watching a mentally disturbed, alcoholic floundering around in life. The story takes forever to get off the ground, and left me feeling anything but humorous."
2,"Terrible story, great performance.","2 stars for the actors, but the story sucks. You hate the main character, have no sympathy for her whatsoever. The entire plot is flawed. A pathetic loser tries to recapture her lost youth with a married man. If there's a point to this, I'm missing it."
1,Ahhhhhh,I don't remember how long this movie was... And I hate regretting things - but I sure wish I could get the time back I wasted watching this one. I love charlize Theron but this movie sucks big time
1,SUCKED,This movie lacked a plot. The protagonist did not learn anything nor did she over come anything. She was a jerk the entire movie. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS MOVIE.
1,Terrible,"Just not what I would expect with the actors involved. Not only was it boring and predictable, it was just bad!"
3,Hmmmm.....,"Hmmm....what can I say? The acting was okay, the storyline wasn't my cup of tea, and the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth. I don't like to bash movies, books, authors, or artists, so that is all I will say about this movie."
1,The virtual fish tank has better character development...,"Also, the fish tank has a higher rating, I highly recommend the fish tank. Just watch the fish tank and you can thank me later."
2,Boring dark comedy,Young Adult is so boring I only managed to watch half of it. Washed up writer trying to break up the happy marriage of her ex boyfriend. Bleak and disappointing to say the least. Don't even bother with this one.
2,ehh,A few funny moments but just a sort of boring dark comedy. Best thing in this film in Charlize Theron acting however the plot needed alot of work.
2,Don't waste your time!,I want my time back! What a horrible movie. I am surprised Charlize Theron would do such a bad movie...
2,Depressing,"For some reason I was under the impression that this movie was a comedy. It most certainly was not. I had the displeasure of watching Charlize Theron fall miserably from being a high school prom queen to a single, depressed, and emotionally unstable young adult. I do not recommend this movie."
1,"Awful, pointless film","This was a terrible film. The acting was ok, but if I wanted to see a self-absorbed wastrel try to ruin someone's life, I would watch trashy reality TV."
1,Terrible,"Very slow, very boring, and over all waste of time! Shocked Charlize Theron signed on to this crappy movie, it sucked!"
1,T'was like watching a trainwreck,"It felt like watching a train wreck. 10 minutes in I knew I wasn't going to enjoy this movie, but I was sucked in anyways. Most of the 90 minutes was spent cringing and wondering why anyone would make such a movie."
2,save your money,It was predictable and not that interesting. I sat through the entire movie and wish I could get that 2 hours back....Save your money on this one and wait until it comes out on cable.
2,Don't waste your time,"I hate to be another critic piling on, but my wife and I just suffered through this movie. We spent $4.99 to rent the HD version, and the way I figure it, Amazon owes me about $4 back. On the plus side, this is a movie that has fine performances (not great) and...I like the Mini Cooper she drives.Okay, that's about all the positive I can generate. The movie is a study of Theron's character, but it's a two dimensional, unsympathetic character who has no arc. She's unlikable throughout and only comes to discover she's shallow and pathetic, without leading to any resolution. My wife and I kept waiting for this movie to get good, until the credits started rolling and we realized we were out of luck. I expect Ivan Reitmann is usually an excellent director for lighter fare, but this is a dark movie that ends up being irredeemable. Please, don't waste your time. And if you would like to refund us $4, just let me know."
1,"Pointless, tragic and NOT funny","Trying to find the narcissist behavior of a faded prom queen/alcoholic funny was a bit of a strain. This was not a comedy, it was a drama. And aside from the wonderful performance of Patton Oswalt, this film was about a sad and pathetic, 'psycho prom queen' who was beyond deluded about her life and her influence over people. How anyone could find this funny, when she so obviously is mentally ill? Drinking to excess and obsessively pulling out her hair while ignoring reality, she enters the story a shallow self-involved bitch, and despite touching some humanity, exits in the same condition. Theron was truely beliveable, but that still doen'y make the character worth watching.I have lost two hours of my life I can't get back, so save yourself and skip this one."
2,2 Star Stretch .....,"I really enjoy Charlize Theron but this movie was one of her worst, it felt like a movie that really had no point. As one reviewer wrote, I kept waiting for the movie to pick-up, to get better, but it just left you hanging with this empty feeling of 'is that all there is'? The movie never takes the approach that she is going to get better mentally, emotionally, or that she even understands her own short comings. I had anticipated (or hoped for)some humor, but there turned out to be none. Don't waste you money buying or renting this one! If you have any interest in it wait until it is free somewhere then you too can wonder why Charlize Theron would do such an empty movie."
2,Most interesting character was the white pomeranian,"Boring....this moving sucked the energy right out of me. Patton Oswalt is always great, but I found myself only concerned about the little white dog."
1,I hated every character,"I generally like off-beat comedies and thought that I would love this one. I was surprised that I literally hated every character - except for the old high school friend that was beaten because people thought that he was gay in high school - I only disliked him. The man that she was in love with could easily see through her ploys, but didn't stand up to her or dismiss her, his wife was a wuss who just let her ruin the naming day even though her intent and drunkenness was obvious, and the main character was beyond self-absorbed and right down mean. It's hard to connect with a movie when every character sucks."
5,Great almond taste!,The whole family likes these the best of all the Nature Valley Granola Bars. The roasted almond flavor tastes kind of like those almond cookies that you can get in Chinese restaurants. Only drawback is that you need to buy 12 boxes at a time (that's a lot of granola bars)!
1,ROASTED ALMOND GRANOLA BAR,"UNFORTUNATELY, I'M UNABLE TO RATE THIS ITEM BECAUSE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM YET.R/ALVIN BLUE JR"
1,Poorly Made - Feel apart before i even opened the box,This tie rack is poorly made and falls apart. The tie bars are poorly soldered on and as such it bends and breaks easily. one of the tie bars fell off before i even took the cardboard wrapper off the package.
3,"Good for Ties, Not so much for Belts",I bought this to hang belts but it is not suitable for belts. Prongs are too close together so it takes two prongs to hang one belt cutting in half the number of belts you can hang. Hanging ties is a better use but there are better products available to hang ties.
5,Great necklace holder,I hang this in my closest for my necklaces and it works great. This is the second one I own. I would recommend this product
5,Just what I wanted,"Reorganizing necklaces and bracelets, and I plan to use this to hang them on the back of my bathroom door."
5,Perfect for long necklaces!,"This has been the perfect solution for long necklaces, plus it looks great on the wall. Much nicer than keeping them tangled in a drawer or in a too-short jewelry box."
5,Great Necklace holder!,I use this as a holder for my costume necklaces! Keeps the organized and tangle free! I'm really happy with this product.
4,Easy to use tie rack.,"Very simple and easy to use tie rack. I only have my belts on the two wide hooks. But it fits ties very easily. With the rubber no slip grips, ties stay on even when moving the rack or brushing past it. A great, easy to use and install rack.It may have trouble holding more belts, only thing holding it from 5 stars, but all would have this problem."
4,Smaller than I thought it would be.,"I bought this to hang scarves from. I guess I should have read the dimensions but it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The hooks are a tad bit close together to hang scarves from, but it's very sturdy and well made. Would be perfect for belts and ties, and it's alright for my thinner scarves. Overall a nice product!"
3,Not as described,"This book did NOT have ""many illustrated plates protected by translucent overlays in addition to black and white drawings"" as stated by the first reviewer. This is a pretty obvious omission and a disappointing one."
2,"Low quality pic, barely viewable",For the price what did I expect huh? Took me awhile and a very bright light just to be able to see my very fuzzy pic. Not recommended if you really want someone to see you or if you need to make a video.
2,made in India?,before I didn't know that Tweezerman nipper made in India. I always think it's made only in Germany. Or may be this item is not original? I don't know what should I think?
5,great bible study book to help those struggling with their divorce,"I have a friend who has been divorced for 3 years and is still struggling with the divorce. We have been going through this study together and it has really opened his eyes to how to handle it, move on, and to find happiness again ."
2,Obvious and Basic,"From my perspective, this book succeeded in stating the obvious elements/feelings/reactions to a divorce. As a woman, I found it patronizing at times as it added no enlightening perspective to such a traumatic situation. Smoke fails to be empathetic and understanding only explaining how one should and should not act. I finally put it down half way through."
2,a slight mistake,"i had ordered this hat with the blue bill. When i ordred it it had the picture with the blue bill on it. When i recevied it, it had the red bill on it and now the picture shows the red bill on it. I did not want this hat. I wanted the one with blue bill on it. I didn't have time to send it back and get the corrected one by Christmas. I'm upset that they would advertise one thing and send me an alternate. Make sure you double check with vendor cause in this case, what you see isn't always what you get."
5,A Classic Book--A Shame it's Out of Print,"Michael Langford's ""Master Guide to Photography"" is one of the most comprehensive and nicely illustrated books on photography. It's a shame that the publisher has let this title go out of print--it should be updated and republished. Michael covers everything from camera basics to the history of photography to very advanced camera techniques and it's all presented in an interesting and aesthetically pleasing way. Time to reprint and expand it--but worth finding the original from a used dealer."
4,"Now, This Is A Deal","The odds of anyone reading this review are about 200,000 to 1, but in case you are a Martino fan who was hoping the 1976 fusion album ""Joyous Lake"" would someday be released on CD, wait no more. Amazingly, the Savoy marketing people have chosen to include a second album, ""Starbright,"" for free. Altogether, it's a good value, with a running time of 75 minutes and reasonable sound quality.Well, okay, ""Starbright"" seems like a bunch of short, mostly mellow, studio jams thrown together for contractual obligations. But, ""Joyous Lake,"" with it's intricate, funky arrangements, quirky synth sounds, and virtuoso ensemble playing is worth the money alone. It's one of the great hidden classics of 1970s fusion. And some of the ""Starbright"" tracks aren't all that bad, either. If you are a long-time Pat Martino fan, I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,Behavior in Public Places - Notes on the Social Organization,"This book, while containing a lot of information, is not to be considered easy reading. The reader is bombarded with an array of sociological terms thus making reading seem endless. Many idea's could have been expressed in a much simplier manner."
3,Good toy?,I purchased this toy when my daughter was about 3 months. She loved to sit in it. She liked most all of the toys and she liked to jump in it. When she got bigger I was very disappointed with the toy. The keyboard had one key that would light up and no music would play. We thought maybe it was the batteries and replaced them but it still didn't work. The keys also still move up and down so they aren't stuck. I contacted the company but they never returned my call. I wrote them an email and they wrote me back but didn't mention anything about the keyboard. My daughter can't spin the thing by herself so I asked them if there was anything I could do to make it easier for her. They talked about some red button that i don't see at all. My church has a jumper from wal-mart in their nursey and she loves it. Too bad I didn't know before hand. It would have saved me some money. I thought this would be a great toy for her for a while but she barely even sits in it anymore. It just takes up space.. :(
3,Piano CONSISTENTLY broken.,"I LOVE this Jumperoo, don't get me wrong, it works GOOD enough, BUT, I have some beef with the quality of the piano. When my son started using this he was teething pretty bad and would drool quite a bit. Well, because the company decided to NOT make it waterproof it kept getting broken. This happened to me 4 times (I called the company and complained and they immediately would send me a new one) before I finally just took the thing apart and examined it thoroughly only to realize caked spit up on the control panel, upon cleaning it off best I could it started to light up again, but the music never worked again. So, although this product is an awesome one, I would suggest the company make WATERPROOF circuit boards for the piano, because if you ask me, the piano is the best toy on that jumperoo. I would have given this product 5 stars had the best toy on it continued to continually work without issues. A product that doesn't work perfectly doesn't deserve more than 3 stars."
1,Don't Buy,Having twins I bought this one and a learn and Laugh Jumperoo..This Einstein one is awful....does not jump like the jumparoo..Do not buy
1,Is this price correct?,I just bought the same thing at Target for $78 - is the price of $189 correct?
2,"Great at first, but...","We did alot of research before buying this jumper. It is one of the higher priced jumpers, but we thought it was a good brand so we weren't worried. Our daughter loved it! The piano part was her favorite, and she eventually went to it every time we put her in it. She used it so much that we had to change the batteries in it 2x in the first month. About 2 weeks later (we'd had it for 6 weeks by then), the piano quit working altogether. We tried changing the batteries again, but it didn't matter. Now, we are stuck with this thing taking up space in our living room and it is totally useless now that the piano won't work. We could have bought a cheaper one and still have it working after 6 weeks!!!"
5,Great Purchase,This activity jumper is excellent!! It has 4 stations so your child doesn't lose interest in it. It's like a new toy everything he gets in!!Our child has increased his balance and leg strenght tremendously with this product. I highly recommend this!
2,it was disappointing,This was a purchase that I now regret. I loved the way it looked. I liked that it had a swivel seat. I even liked all the toys that came with it. What I didn't like was the seat is not deep enough. My babies were able to lean way too forward and backwards(for my comfort as a parent. I purchased this last night and am taking it back tonight.
3,Provides good physical exercise but boring activities,"I bought this jumper when my son was 4 months old; he's now 7 monhts. He enjoys jmping in it but does not find the activities very interesting. When he was younger, he kept hitting his forehead into the frog. The sun teether didn't/ doesn't work for him because it was too high and too stiff; it doesn't bend easily. And, there's really no stimulation (music or sound) with the catepilar. He's only facing the side with the piano.Overall, I observe that he only enjoys bouncing it. Therefore, if you're looking for an activity center, find something else. If you're looking for a bouncer, then this is it."
2,Baby didn't enjoy and height adjustment sticks...,"I received this jumper as a gift for my son and he never really enjoyed it very much. It isn't very ""jumpy"" and the height adjustors got stuck in between levels and my hubby had to take them apart to ""unstick"" them. No good, very expensive toy that just is not worth the price."
4,"Enough detail, for a change...","Covers the diagnosis of bottlenecks in the system. It's a little short on what to do about it if you are tuning a purchased application. If you're a developer, it's a good start a diagnosis what your program is doing to the system. The networking concepts need the most work. This is where it's most dated, simply because this discipline advances so quickly."
2,Really a disappointment,"With all the good reviews I figured it was a sure thing. Well, it is really just a reference book. There is some good info on drying food, but nothing exciting or exceptional. I guess I was expecting that the 100 irresistible recipes would be dehydrator recipes, recipes that incorporate using a dehydrator, something... Nope, almost every recipe has nothing to do with the title of the book. It should be titled ""Drying Food Reference Guide with 100 Totally Unrelated Recipes that the author thinks are irresistible"". Ugh..."
4,Just a Bit Short,"This book is a good reference for my general learning of dehydrating and the equipment involved. I felt it left me still asking a lot of questions and got almost as much info from the insert in the new dehydrator. Its good for a starter book, but I'm ready for intermediate level already."
3,Good but disappointing,"So far this book is very thorough in how to dry just about everything and there are some fun recipes but I'm disappointed, too. One of the main reasons that I'm trying to dry my own fruit is that most commercial dried fruit is treated with sulfer dioxide and I am highly allergic to sulfa. (Hives, trouble breathing,...very bad.) This book's answer to pretreating just about every fruit and fruit leather is to sulfer it. I'm sure that makes it better but aren't there other options?"
3,Lots of good info,"This book has a lot of valuable and useful information. Unfortunately, I have had to use it with other books because she uses sodium bisulfate as pretreatment. The recipes for finished product are awesome and her suggestions for which vegetables and fruits are good candidates for dehydration are right on (I am a vegan). I would recommend this as a reference book, but with a ""second opinion"" book as back up."
3,Pretty good-could be better,"I bought a food dehydrator to make my own fruit leather and yogurt. I purchased this book so I would understand how to dry particular fruits, vegetables, etc. The book does DEEPLY cover historical information about many vegetables and fruits. For example, carrots were originally white, purple and yellow. Thanks for the information. But, I knew this and its not relevant to dehydrating. I would have appreciated a table of information: storage, prep, drying temp etc. More importantly, I was expecting recipes for dehydrating. Not a recipe using dehydrating ingredients in another recipe. I think listing recipes that use dried tomato (devilled eggs)is not a recipe for dehydrating. I was looking for something unique, like say: zucchini pineapple chips, peanutbutter banana leather or apple pie cheddar roll-ups. So if you are looking for recipes this book is weak in this regard. I love my dehydrator. Best investment! Book-useful but not the best."
3,It's ok.,"It's a good intro to drying book. The bulk of it is a list of foods and the temperatures, times, etc. for drying them. Helpful, but not the best book on drying. I prefer Mary Bell's Complete Dehydrator Cookbook."
5,Bronchitis help,"Aftervyears of bronchitis and having to take heavy drugs, I found this product. If you take it at the first signs, it brings up the mucus and does not take hold in your system.... But you havE to start right away."
3,Mixed thoughts,"The only problem I have with this book, is that there are many, many facts that conflict with the same data in Harry Christiansen's New Lake Shore Electric. Mr. Christiansen was an expert on the topic, and his facts must be taken as absolute fact. One example would be the eastbound car in the Vermilion wreck. This book erroneously lists it as #12 several times, but the car was actually #14, verified in a photo of the wreck, as well as Christiansen's text of the account in his book. The biggest fact is the building of the Sandusky Connecting Railway. Christiansen says 1926 whereas this book says 1931. Mr. Christiansen was alive and there to witness the line, so again, his must be taken as fact. I will give credit though, much remains a mystery. I'm sure Harwood and Korach may have corrected a few facts Harry got wrong. It goes both ways, so my recommendation is yes, buy this book and read it, but also buy Harry's book and read that. Then, you decide."
4,A good reproduction.,"The book not explain the stockholders or principles of these corporations, which would have been very benificial to the reader."
4,Très bon album,"Mélangeant les pièces lentes et les pièces rapides dans son style unique et particulier, Mike Stern est un véritable magicien ave son instrument. Weckl est quand à moi le meilleur batteur pour ce style de musique."
3,it's alright,"I think like this album.It's a bit easy , but pleasant -in a good way.Won't listen to it every day, but it makes perfect background music, and the playing is of usual standard.It's ""Odds or Evens"" though which is on my Ipod - In my mind a completelly different calibre of an album altogether."
1,cd not playable,the cd was too damaged. it kept skipping and other songs just wouldn't play. so now i have to purchase ANOTHER cd. but this time will get it new from a store.
4,Cash Money Cool,"I really like this product. The seat is nice and substantial and the coins add a really interesting twist to an otherwise ordinary item. The only disappointment is that the lucite used is slightly cloudy in color, ergo 4 stars in stead of 5. I was hoping it would look a little more like clear glass as it will be used as a compliment to a clear glass vessel sink. Otherwise I am satisfied with this purchase and I will still use it as planned.The company, (Brown's Linens), sent the seat in record breaking time. I had it in just a couple days. I will confidently order from this vendor in the future.Thank you Brown's Linens."
3,Toilet Seat,This was ordered a couple years ago. I was slightly disappointed with the item as some of the coins in the seat are tarnished. It makes the seat always look dirty.
3,Good but get dirty to fast,"They work good for cleaning glass but they get dirty real quickly so unless you have a few extras, you'll be waiting for them to finish in the washing machine before you can finish your cleaning."
2,Beck Not at His Best !,"I previously read ""He's The One"" by TJB and thoroughly enjoyed it. This one really didn't do much for me. An interesting cast of characters in a storyline that really didn't go anywhere. The fact that there wasn't a whole lot of sex was refreshing for a title of this genre. The big caper, a character (the boss of our cast of characters who work in a department store) who collects Dolly Parton dolls and doesn't want anyone to know about her passion, has her dolls held for ransom by her employees. (I mean really, it bordered on the ridiculous). I would be willing to read another one of this author's titles, but if it is not better then this one I'll have to say good-bye to TJB."
2,Disappointing !,"I am afraid this is a far cry from the previous 3 books. Definitely not a gay romance though it does feature a gay couple who sadly does not take center stage though they are interesting characters. Eh..I can count the no. of pages really focusing on their story, 20 pages more or less towards the end. ""Someone like you"" resembles a day time TV soap opera, focusing on straights finding the loves of their lives, a gay man befriending straights, 1 bad guy and 1 cranky lady trying to add spice to a story which seem all over the place and of course let's not forget the characters' working lives! If this is the trend TJB's future books are going, they have just lost one fan."
5,LOVE this book,This is a great book for anyone who wants to escape everyday life and just have a great time. It's like an adventure that you don't want to end. I make all of my friends read it... And I just bought it again as a gift. I recommend it to everyone.
4,"Very entertaining, but light fare","I found this book to be Timothy James Beck's best! It was very entertaining and more effectively integrated different characters than his previous books, which I did also enjoy quite a bit. It is very light fare, and there are occasional hiccups in the plot or characterizations, but they are easily overlooked. This one is a new setting with all new characters (with a cameo by Sheila, the Zodiac model from previous books), and blends in more straight characters with the gay ones than in previous books. I think the writing was improved and definitely the depth of the characters has improved over previous books. His books are light fare, not high-brow intellectual stuff, but really, I find it good fun to lose myself in some fluffy, relationship comedy (romantic and otherwise)now and then! I found this book very entertaining; it kept me wanting to know more about these characters and made me actually want to visit the Mall of America!"
4,Some One Like You,"It is pure escapisem which I enjoy a great deal. I have read the previous three books by Timothy James Beck. I am glad to find an author who is able to write gay romatic comedys without lots of ""porn""."
1,I want to make one thing perfectly clear,"Despite your album title not everybody was trying to imitate 10,000 Maniacs in 1993, and so therefore the title doesn't apply to you. If you wanted to just say you were recording an album then that's fine, but don't say you are doing this because everyone else is SO THERE!!!!!! Now that my venting over the title is over now onto serious business: ""Linger"" is my first introduction of the Cranberries, and let's just say that it was as bad as getting a manly handshake from a woman. The melody is despicable, and the lyrics are too, and it was one of the bad memories of the first months in FL. That's where I was first introduced to this, so I feel that if everyone was rocketing to the moon in their underpants would you?"
5,Still the Cranberries' best after so long...,"Even after the release of ""Bury the Hatchet"" (which comes close but not quite...), this CD remains the berries' best. ""Dreams"" and ""Linger"", the singles, are the well-known classics, but quite frankly all the songs here are terrific. It would be easier to mention the songs that don't measure up to the rest of the album than it would be to mention the really good ones. Really. Being without this CD ought to be a crime."
2,No substance,"You know, after listening to this album several times, I can't help thinking ""just another Irish band.""DREAMS is a wonderful song, I could listen to it all day long. Linger is a solid piece, too. Beyond those two songs, everything else is wishy-washy, not memorable, not remarkable, bland.I rate this CD two stars purely on the strength of Dreams, with maybe a nod to Linger. If any of the other 10 songs had something to offer . . ..But they don't."
3,Great Album...new alt rock!,"Fresh sound, amazing voice. Check this CD out. Add some spice to your music collection. CHEERS!"
5,This is the Bomb!,"I love this CD! I've owned it for a day and a half and I can't stop listening! I love the songs, the lyrics, the vocals, and the music in general! It is a great CD all around!"
2,"One great song, a whole lot of filler","The Cranberries' debut has one song that's so excellent, it makes you want to forgive the rest of the CD for being so boring.That song is ""Dreams"", and is the best argument for buying this CD until a greatest-hits package comes along. A perfect blend of melody and music, the song is intimately beautiful and shows exactly what vocalist Delores O'Riordan can do when she puts her mind to it.Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The rest of this CD, sad to say, is bargain-basement Enya. O'Riordan's ""Ahh-ahhs"" on ""I Still Do"" sound like yawns, and many of the other tracks that aim for emotion end up dangerously close to self-parody.""Linger"", for instance, is about emotional turmoil, but O'Riordan sings it like there's something she'd rather be doing.Some may find comfort in the sameness of approach here, but all others should tread carefully. Paying full price for a one-song CD does not a bargain make."
4,A great album for a long drive towards calming down,"If you're ever in a cruddy mood and need to get in your car and drive and just think (or not think) about things, this wouldn't be a bad choice to put in your CD player. The songs cover a range of emotions without ever being less than calming and soothing.""Dreams"" is full of hope, ""Linger"" is hopeful and soaring, and ""How"" has a rolling feel to it that perfectly matches the way a road rolls beneath the front of a car.It's much cooler than Enya and that sort of stuff, yet it evokes a similar mood. I'd recommend it for Dolores O'Riordan's voice alone."
3,A fine first effort by the Cranberries,"The Cranberries first album has a great sound to it, which the songwriting hadn't caught up to yet. Singer Dolores O'Riordan has a lovely, unique voice. The singles, ""Dreams"" and ""Linger"", are easily the best songs here. Of the remainder, ""How"" is very good. I enjoy this album whenever I listen to it, but there are several songs that don't leave any lasting impression."
3,"Everyone else is reviewing this, so why can't I?","Dolores O'Riordan's voice can range from hauntingly beautiful to badly out of place. Although it is pretty in ""Pretty"" and dreamy in ""Dreams"", it doesn't fit all the material well. ""I Will Always"" is a great song, but it's missing a second verse and an instrumental solo (this could have been a big hit). Kudos to Feargal Lawlor for fine drumming. If the Cranberries can find songs to suit their vocal stylings, look out. Until then, 3 stars for 3 really good songs."
4,"It's okay, 1 song stands out.",Dreams is the reason. No regrets. The song goes deep... The sound/state of the album is okay. It's worth buying.
2,"a collector's item, but not all that great.","I'm a big mega man fan. I was just looking through the mega man official complete works and noticed that these comics exist. I have megamix and gigamix, and they are great. The new archie comics series is also pretty good so far.This company, dreamwave, made 4 issues and went out of business. I think there was good reason for that. There's virtually no conflict for mega man in these comics. enemies are taken out in 3 panels! He one shots almost everyone! most of the content revolves around ""rocky"" going to school. yeah, mega man goes to school and has a romantic interest at school.Aside from the story being a bit weak, the art isn't all that great either. If you're a collector, then by all means add this to your collection. If you're looking for something to read and have a passing interest in mega man, skip this one and get a subscription with archie comics"
4,Thanks Dan Gavere!,"This is a great video for beginning SUPers, or if you want to learn some techniques that can help you get started in your first SUP race. He pretty much tells you everything you need to know to get started and not look like a dork out on the water. The techniques are simple and Dan Gavere does a great job demonstrating/explaining them. I find this video very useful and recommend it to all of my friends who catch the stoke after their first SUP session."
3,A slight exaggeration,"The video is almost a commercial. I am not saying that it doesn't have useful information, but it is more like a compilation of things you might be interested in trying on a paddle board. I think you might like it, but the word ultimate is used rather loosely."
3,Buyer Beware - This Product is a NFR Unit,"Upon closer examination of this products SKU number it is labeled as a NFR (Not For Resale) unit. The SonicWALL PRO 2040 you SHOULD buy is the 01-SSC-5700.Buyer beware - if you buy a NFR item and you are NOT an authorized SonicWALL reseller you will not be happy if you need to add services, access tech support or have to return this unit for repair."
2,Not really an instruction book,"There are very few pages in this book devoted to learning how to actually play the bouzouki and even those pages are very simplistic. The book mostly contains short biographies of bouzouki players and some tunes with chords written in standard musical notation rather than tab. Although the Amazon description refers to a CD and the book continually refers to a cassette, neither come with the book and there is no information that I can find in the book telling how to obtain the recording. There was really nothing in the book about the Irish bouzouki that I hadn't already found on the web during some quick searches making the price of the book way out of proportion to what I received."
3,JT alla prova con brani natalizi,"Come sempre JT riesce a produrre qualche cosa di interessante .Ho comprato nello stesso periodo sia quelo pubblicato dalla COLUMBIA che quello della HALLMARK (fuori catalogo) - contengono alcuni pezzi uguali.Comunque, ottime performances."
4,Eye opening,"I always associated Harry Miller with the Offenhauser engine and carbuerators. I had no idea he was into so many other things, I enjoyed the book, not so much for the history, although that was interesting. I enjoyed the book for it's technical drawings and background for his engines. It was a joy to read.Thanks,John Mezera8301 Hempshire Pl Apt. 101Raleigh, NC 27613(252) 299-0127"
5,Great Idea-Book,"This is a great book if you're looking for ideas on how to decorate your room. It has plenty of rooms and styles to choose from. I re-did our master bedroom, using a look I saw in here, and it looks fantastic!""Make It Yours"" isn't going to give you tips and techniques on how to do each little thing in the room, but it gives you a good foundation of how to achieve the overall look."
3,Decorating Tips & Photos for Fans of the Show,"These spin off books from the television decorating shows give the viewer more depth than the show allows or can disappoint. Here I had trouble with the book's format. Some pages crowded five photos together making it hard to see the details. For project how-to, the one-page instructions seem skimpy for ambitions projects like slipcovering a chair or applying fabric to the wall. The 14 pages devoted to a chronological guide of the show's episodes seems pretty self-indulgent.Despite those criticisms, there are good ideas to be found here. I liked the project of tracing words onto semisheer fabric for a pillow cover. I'd recommend borrowing this book from the library, unless you are a hardcore fan of the show."
1,Sorry I bought this book,"This book misses the mark. I am a survivor of trauma with years of recovery behind me. This book takes a tough love approach, constantly reminding the reader of his/her limitations and can't say enough about how those limitations may never be healed to his/her desire. The correlation of survivors to Frankenstein's monster is a pity. I get the analogy, but couldn't the author come up with something other than the truely heinous? I would rather recommend ""Legacy of the Heart"" by Wayne Miller--a much gentler and realistic approach to healing trust."
5,Trust After Trauma,"I really love & appreciate Aphrodite Matsakis. As in her other book, I Can't Get Over It, she is very compassionate & kind, yet very detailed regarding the process of recovery. I would recommend it."
1,A reader,"I couldn't get past a glaring mistake in Chapter 1 - specifically the author's explanation of Step 4 in 12- step programs. Step 4 DOES require ""a fearless and searching"" moral inventory of yourself. It DOES NOT, however, ask for a list of ""those persons you think you may have hurt . . ."" as a result of your addiction. That is Step 8. How could the editors have missed this?"
2,"It's a disguise, all right","This album was a real disappointment. After reading several reviews, I was expecting some bluesy grit and funk from one of my favorite musicians, Cesar Rosas. There's only a couple of tunes that live up to those expectations--""You've Got To Lose"" and ""Tough To Handle"". The best stuff here are the two polkas with Flaco Jimenez, ""Angelito"" and ""Adios Mi Vida"". The rest comes off like something that should be backing up a beer commercial. ""Little Heaven"" sounds like Rosas was abducted by Billy Joel. Forget East L.A., some of this stuff is strictly suburbia. Better luck on the next one, Cesar."
3,Cesar or Los Lobos,"First ask yourself: do you like Los Lobos? If the answer is yes, then you will like this album. I like Los Lobos. I even saw them at a small taping for a radio station (WXPN's World Cafe). Cesar's voice carries well in these tunes, and the musical styles are all over the Los Lobos map. Again, if you enjoy Los Lobos, you will enjoy this CD. I never missed ""the band"" of regulars, and was quite surprised how much of the Los Lobos sound and style comes through in Cesar's disc."
5,Perfect!!!,"The item were shipped in a timely fashion and in perfect form! They were as described and ready to go. Do I use it? YES! I have not had my hair cut by anyone since buying it and will not. My wife does have to trim around the edges but other than that, it is the only way to go. Just wish I had started earlier!!! Thanks!"
5,great product,this is our second flowbee. The first one was used for years until it finally died. Will definitely buy again when this one goes.
4,Not bad at all,"I just bought this 2 months ago after running across it on ebay. I've seen the commercial for it of course but never paid too much attention to that one, I actually laughed at it beforeSo I decided to buy it and hope for the best. The first haircut I was nervous, but it did a marvelous job. You have to learn which adaptor works for what part of the hair and what length it cuts at, but I got my haircut for less time than I would have driven to a salon and sat to wait.I've since used it one more time, and still did a good job. This time I had to supplement with finishing touches with a scissor and razor (for the fuzz that grows in the back of the neck and the extra length on sideburns and ear).Keep in mind I'm a guy with average to long medium curly hair. I wouldnt know how it would perform on womens hair or hair that is too curly. If youre a guy with straight or medium curly hair, I definitely think you won't be disappointed"
4,Special instructions for coarse curly hair,"I am Jewish and have coarse and curly hair. I actually have to run this through my hair *sideways* (that is, making a narrow path, rather than a wide path), with the leading edge lifted slightly off my head. The hair needs to be clean and dry (contrary to the instruction manual). So I can't use the taper attachments, but otherwise it works well, though it takes me a while since I'm cutting narrower swaths.I really like not having to go out and wait at a salon - I think this will lead to my hair looking better on average.From the manual: ""Although the FLOWBEE won't work on Afro-style hair, it will work on thick or somewhat curly hair. For best results, cut this type of hair wet; wet hair is more relaxed."""
5,Flobee hair cutting system,"I purchased the system for my daughter-in-law who had seen it advertised and wanted it to cut the childrens' hair. She loves it because it allows her to cut the hair quickly and without hair going all over the children making them itchy, then mixing that with their tears. They don't mind a hair cut now at all."
1,Flowbee,"I was very disappointed with the flowbee. It is entirely too heavy to use very easy and also very very noisy. I had purchased it to use to groom my dog, but with the noise there was no way. I have returned the item and asked for a credit on my credit card.Judy"
5,I love this thing!,"I only trust 2 people to cut my hair, me or my mother! So, since I'm a little too old to hassle mom for a haircut I decided to splurge on this system, and it works great. You have to read the instructions carefully to figure it out (simple instructions), but once you get the lengtheners set (actually, stacked) correctly and you bounce this thing through your hair with your vacuum, it truly does give a perfect cut. The lengtheners that I mentioned are clear plastic, so you can see this thing cutting your hair in a perfectly straight line. Just a note, as stated in the instructions you have to ""bounce"" it through your hair when cutting, you can't just run it through. If you have a powerful enough vacuum WITH A HOSE ATTACHMENT, and you are a ""do-it-yourself(er), this is a long term moneysaver!"
1,Stopped working after one use,Used it once and worked fine. Second time I tried to use it it stopped working. DO NOT BUY! Now I have a $100 piece of plastic.
2,Does not work for coarse hair,I guess my hair is too coarse for the flow bee product. I am using a dyson for suction. The product is not useful for coarse thick hair.
5,The novelty never wears off...,"My family has had one of these for a decade now, and saved a ton on haircuts. It was always good for a joke, entertaining to show friends, and provides for a very utilitarian haircut. Oddly enough, there's some almost hypnotic property to the device as well - and its kind of like getting a scalp massage at the same times as your haircut.I was recently home again and cut my own hair in about 20 minutes. My wife had to trim the neck fuzz, but it was as good a trim as I get when I go to the somewhat unpredictable national chains that charge $12/cut. Take that hair establishment.I must admit this product isn't for everyone. If you're really serious about your looks, you should probably pass on this. If you don't have a sense of humor - also pass. If being frugal fits in to your style - you've definitely found your item."
2,Flowbee,The product is outdated technologically due to its size and bulk making it extremely ackward to handle and the 1980's instructions are lacking a great deal of direction in how to use it. The clear spacers are flimsy and cheap. The machine lacks branding or labels. I contacted the company and did not receive a response. This is a company which has obviously made a good return on their one invention and one would think they would have at least after so many years reached out to some of the great minds of the hair cutting industry and asked for their input as how to best use their invention in a true functional manual with current styles. The concept is still stuck as unpolished as the day of its debut in the market... a clunky machine invented by a handy man in his garage delivered in a white plain box with 1980's instructions.
4,I Love my Flowbee--but not from Amazon!!!,"I love my Flowbee that I purchased in 2004! It does great work and I go to a salon twice a year to get a ""professional"" cut and Flowbee in-between. Amazon offers it at $104, but if you go to flowbee.com it is $79.95, the same price I paid in 2004.....8 years ago!"
5,Flowbeeliever,"My girlfriend was very doubtful when I told her I purchased a Flowbee. The first word out of her mouth when I came out of the bedroom with my new haircut was ""WOW""!After getting hacked haircuts for years I finally decided to take matters into my own hands. Best decision I've ever made on a haircut."
5,Money Saver!!!!,"My first Flowbee, bought from an infomercial when they first came out, bit the dust recently. It's reliability? IT JUST NOW NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND WAS USED VERY FREQUENTLY ON FAMILY AND FRIENDS FOR YEARS!!! I did get one like the original that I had, so can't comment on the new Flowbee.I highly recommend this product and Amazon. com is one of the easiest ways to shop."
2,Good product,"This is a great product for those who want to style their own hair. However, my Flowbee arrived with broken parts. It's a wonderful product and Amazon shipped it fast."
5,A bit unsettling to the Lost Cause diehards...,"After getting stationed in Georgia back in 1997, I became interested in the cause of the Southern Unionists. As a CivWar reenactor I found this subject to be on one hand totally verbotten for polite fireside conversation. On the other, some interest but little information. Thank God over the last few years several books have come out to help fill that info gap. The South vs The South(poorest of the group), Lincoln's Loyalists, and Guerillas, Unionists,& Violence On the Confederate Homefront(very good!) have done alot for these forgotten souls. The best remains Lincoln's Loyalists, my orginal was permantly borrowed by a ""rebel"" buddy and passed about throughout the greyback community. Finally I've found another copy! Even for hardcore seesch, this book is a must read for anyone studying this sad chapter of our nations history."
2,disappointed in a great brand,"I have bought Bluebonnet supplements for years; Bluebonnet has a good reputation for quality and price. And so I hardly hesitated to buy its multi-vitamin when I began searching for a new brand. I was terribly disappointed to discover, however, that it contains 5000 IUs of Vitamin A Palmitate (in addition to 5000 IUs of natural beta-carotene) for its Vitamin A component. Excess palmitate has long been known to contribute to bone loss and osteoporosis, and women are strongly advised to avoid it in supplement form. For more information on this, google the Mayo Clinic.I implore Bluebonnet to remove palmitate from this product--5000 IUs beta carotene supplies plenty of Vitamin A! For now, sorry to say, I wasted my money; don't waste yours."
3,Hard to find ingredients,"I bought this book because of all the great reviews, however when I recieved it in the mail and started reading the recipes I was dissapointed because the recipes had ingredients that were hard to find. For example, special cheeses and spices that could not be found in your typical grocery store. I would have liked to see more recipes that had everyday staple ingredients that we would not have to search for."
1,what is the point?,ridiculous recipes. things I wouldnt feed to a dog. Get the williams sonoma recipe book.
4,not a bad mix on CD2!,"This is a very good mix comp. Mario Piu is very good. He kicks off the proceedings with 'Silence' which is an amazing track,especially if someone like Tiesto is behind the remix. Mario then goes all BXR and dishes out some pretty good tunes like 'lovin' obviously 'save a soul' 'techno harmony' and the outstanding 'baguette'. But the track that does it for me is Thomas Schumacher's 'Schall'. What a tune! Nice b-line. CD2 On the other hand,is a fairly techno-y affair. He starts off nice with a cool intro before the pounding beats of 'soundshaper' charge in. He keeps up the tempo through tracks 3-8 before going down his hard house route. I personally hate hard house nowadays since it went a bit tonka-town. I end this with praise for the two london style boshathons of 'cropduster' and '04' with superb mixing to boot. I think this is a must have purchase for anyone seeking decent tunes, though i feel this could have been better!"
1,Didnt like it.,"After a few uses the lid just broke, Also did not seem to seal like it said it should we still had a gap where air and bugs could get in."
2,Not sturdy,"I want to like this foodbin, because I bought two of them! Two big complaints: The lid constantly falls off the hinges and without it being 1/2 way full it falls over every time I open the lid."
5,it works,"Unique size that is smaller width/length, but is taller. Thus it is a better fit space-wise. All in relation to its big capacity."
3,"Great Size, Poor Quality","The bin is a great size and very convenient. However, the hinges are made of a very cheap plastic. As a result, the lid has a tendency to un-hinge and its very difficult to put back in place."
4,Just big enough.,"The bin is pretty sturdy and holds a 40lb bag of dog food, up to the very top. I have two of them."
4,Pistol Whipped,"There are very few good Sex Pistol's Cd's but this is a good one. Worth the money. But like alot of Sex Pistol's Cd's, they seem to just be copies of each other."
4,A very good resource for the collector,"As with the Kovels other books, this reference is very exhaustive and complete. There are, perhaps, some mistakes, but given the volume of information here that is to be expected. I find I reach for this book first when I'm trying to identify a piece of this age group, and usually find what I'm looking for here. Easy to travel with, from antique shop to auction. A good buy."
3,Excellent reference book.,"Exactly what I was expecting. A bit difficult to understand at first, but once you understand the layout it really makes it easy to use for reference."
3,AVERAGE GHOST STORY,"Compared to a lot of horror movies being made today, SPIRIT TRAP is an okay if average spook tale.A group of college students find themselves sharing quarters in a huge, but spooky house. We have the girl with the mysterious past; the nice guy next door type; the brash and arrogant drug dealer and his nymphomaniacal girlfriend, plus the mysterious recluse. Soon they encounter the spirit of a slave who was murdered in the house and wants to come back to life. It's all pretty predictable and a little slow at times, but it creates an eerie mood and the actors are decent, especially Luke Mably (PRINCE AND ME) as the hedonistic jerk."
4,Better Than i expected.,"Spirit Trap, starring the beautiful Billie Piper, was much better than I thought it would be. Unlike many haunted house type flicks, this one had a happy ending. I won't ruin things by going into details, but suffice it to say, okay plot, the only people to get offed were people you didn't care for anyway, and to top it off, Billie Piper. Only complaint was that she stayed stubbornly dressed throughout the movie :)"
1,Could Not Finsih it.,"BORING. Thats all i can say about this one. is just VERY boring. I got about 15 minutes in it, and took it out of my DVD player. DO NOT reccomend."
2,"average, not much for jumps","like most of the other reviewers, i got this for billie piper. her acting in this movie was okay. the plot, being stuck in a haunted house and having some spirits haunt you and things going bump in the night, has been done a zillion times, and better. there really isn't much horror, or a lot of action. though ms piper is the main actress, i thought the supporting caste was average at best. the extra has caste interviews which was quite boring. all they did was pat each other on the back and had nothing but good things to say about their project. it takes place in romania, which you'd never know since the whole focus of the movie is on this haunted house, that they all rented because it was close to college for them. very brief nudity (no, not billie), and heavy drug usuage (no, not billie) is in the movie. rent, borrow or skip it, as you'll probably only watch it once or twice."
2,What's new scooby doo vol 6 Monster matinee,Product arrived on time but in less than perfect condition it skips and stutters alot. But it doesn't bother the kids just my husband and myself.
4,Almost perfect,"This DVD is full of surprises some good, one not. I liked all the episodes especially the first one with a cameo by KISS at a halloween party. The only part I didnt like was the laugh track. Why on earth would you have a laugh track on a Scooby Doo cartoon? Its insulting. But overall a great DVD"
5,Playa Flizzy Ridin High,"Playa Fly is the man. He is the best rapper out there. I got all 4 of his albums and I suggest anyone that doesnt to get you some playa Fly. Anytime Im listening to Music it is Playa Fly. and I cant wait for FLY2K to come out, I know that'll be strizaight"
5,Playa Fly-Da Game Owe Me,"BUY THIS [darn] CD, YOU HAVE GOT TO IT IS IN MY OPIONION ONE OF THE BEST [darn] CDS EVER MADE, IT IS A CLASSIC EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THIS CD AND LISTEN TO WHAT THIS MAN HAS TO SAY. I CANNOT STRESS HOW GOOD THIS ALBUMB IS, IT IS CERTAINLY WORTH EVERY PENNY I WOULD PAY [amt.] FOR IT IF I HAD TO."
4,",","The author's goal was to approach a romance in a realistic way, and most of the time I felt that she achieved that. I don't know much about stroke patients but I got the feeling O'Connor didn't either. Aside from that, the tackled uncomfortable details with great honesty that left me really rooting for a happy ending. Although the end wasn't exactly that it didn't leave me disappointed either."
5,A welcome addition to ANY collection,"No matter if you are a newcomer to jazz or an old hand, sometimes you need someone else to pick the titles so you can just relax and listen. This is the album for those times! No jazz fan could ever be embarrassed by these top flight performances by big name talent. BUY IT! LOVE IT!"
2,Works partially,"I needed an RCA cable and decided to buy this one because I could potentially connect another peripheral to the same port. The cable works but the piggyback part doesn't. It met my need but if you need to use the piggyback part, it's a gamble."
1,terrible sound quality when plugged in two cables,first things first i was running this cord from a cd player to a receiver and the sound quality was okay about the same as normal cords. when i plugged in my ipod into the end of the cables the sound quality of the cd player and the ipod diminished terribly you get what you pay for don't buy you are better off getting an av splitter
3,Didnt work for me,"I bought these cables to enable an older LCD TV in my kids play room (that has only 1 set of RCA Audio inputs) to be fed from both a games console and a DVD player.The solution did not work...Not sure if the problem I encountered is indicative of all potential uses for this product, but here is what I found:'Joining' the DVD player and Games console outputs together with this cable resulted in extra impedance that prevented the Games Console audio from being heard. Even with the TV volume turned up to Max, I had to have my ear against the speaker to hear the audio. The cable is not faulty as such as using it with only the Games Console OR only the DVD player worked just fine."
4,Beware the rebate...,"Beware the company managing the rebate offer, ExpressGroup. I sent all of the information in, they somehow were able to log my information into the computer, but still note it as insufficient - and then never notified me of any issues. After faxing a copy of the documents, and a follow up call, they will be sending the rebate in 8 - 10 weeks. One would expect that a company whose sole job is to handle rebates would do this correctly. My experience is consistent with stories I have heard of companies like this that will conveniently lose information knowing the buying public will not follow up.Beware of ExpressGroup"
3,No substitute for a good lawyer...,"This software is good software. But please remember that a computer program is no substitute for a good lawyer. At the very least get one to look over your completed document for you. You wouldn't want a computer error to end up costing your loved ones more time, money and hassle in the courts."
2,Does Santa Exist ?,If you are a non believer you will remain one after watching this vid. If you are a believer you will remain one after watching this vid.Same old arguments for Christians.Hitchens seems at times and I think he even made it clear at one point he was a lil frustrated in Craig either not understanding him or simply ignoring his answers.This vid I think clearly shows what you get when you try and talk to a brick wall...nothing.I think one big let down I felt was that Hitchens was not his normal in your face arrogant self. That became evident very early on.Nothing new in this vid.
3,Book review,"The book itself was in fine shape for it's age. However the dust jacket was trashed.-This was not disclosed in the description of the item.It does of course, not affect the actual book, which is really what I wanted. As a WW'er for over 3 years, I am intrigued by the story of the founder of the company. It is amazing to find that most of the basic principles of her program still stand today!This book will be passed around my meeting group."
2,really poor condition but listed as good,"the cover was missing, the book was stained, spine broken, pages had been written on. Very poor condition but it arrived super fast."
1,WARNING--DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!,"I ordered similar guns directly from this company. Their return policy is NON-EXISTENT! They say you can return, but they will only ""attempt"" to repair and send the same gun back and say you only have ONE chance to send the gun back then it is yours. So we have 2 broken guns (because they don't hold up for any length of time) and spent $200.00. I am also going to report this company tho the BBB and Amazon.com. Order at your own risk--if it breaks or never worked--it yours and you are out the money!"
1,terrible,"we purchased two things. an airsoft rifle and an airsoft gun. never received the gun. paid partial with a gift cert for amazon and balance on my debit card. I have asked multiple times for my money back by ck and i beleive a credit for amazon. We will never use it and would not log on to amazon because of the customer service. I feel the whole experience as a ""christmas gift from my nephew"" has been terrible. The rifle that we bought on the same order broke within a few hours. We are not very happy. I would not even rate this experience."
5,great to find,"hard to find in stores, but having them online is truly great and worth seeking out.this is a great deal and they are great tasting as well. a must have for folks who love the trail mix chewy bars."
4,Heraldry Isn't For Everyone,"Von Volborth has a commanding view of the art and the science of heraldry, which is not as dead as people may think! This is one of the finest books on the subject in the past hundred years."
5,The Bop Gun in CD form...,"Dr. Funkenstein: or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love 'Da Bomb!' Bought it after an intriguing encounter with the Give Up The Funk video, and was completely hooked!Any missteps are minor (there are some... the two albums add up to nearly 2 1/2 hours of music). But when Clinton and his mob hit the one, they really Hit The One. Awesome grooves that MAKE you dance, even if you can't (I'll reserve judgement on myself for now). Completely ruined me for all other funk (except of course JB) because it is just so visceral and magical. Nothing else comes close.The groove speaks for itself. What doesn't get much play is George Clinton's genius for a lyric. High concept songs like Chocolate City and Funkentelechy rival in their ideas legends like Dylan and Lennon. Any many who can both write the line ""You might as well pay attention because you can't afford free speech"" and make it JAM is brilliant in my book."
5,THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION,"George Clinton and his funk family Parliament Funkadelic has been around for years creating some of the funkiest grooves ever put to wax.. This collection illustrates that this band was and still is one of the funkiest bands ever.. Most of the songs on this collection is taking from 8 of their best albums from the opening P-Funk (Wants To Get Funked Up) taking from one of the greatest funk albums ever Mothership Connection to the closing on disc 2 Funkin For Fun this is a great musical experience.. A great introduction to those who may not be familiar with all the great music of this group.. This is a must for die hard Funk Fans .. Personal favorites: Bop Gun, Aqaua Boogie, All Your Goodies Gone, Funkentelechy, Theme From Black Hole"

5,"Really? Review a radiator cap? Ok, read on then","What more can you ask for? You turn it clockwise and it locks on the radiator or coolant tank. Reverse the procedure and ""boom!"" It's off again. Magic I tell ya!! Seriously though, Stant has been making caps for many, many years. They may have invented the darn thing!! If you want cheap imported stuff look else where. Stant is an OEM supplier to multiple vehicle makers. Trust them for quality.Sounds good right? I'm not sure what they need me to say. It's a radiator cap for heavens sake!! Well, go forth and replace yours. I did. Thanks Amazon and thank you Prime for shipping a $7 item for free.Peace"
3,Not so happy with this,"For some reason, Possibly no fault of the radiator cap, the cap became stuck and had to be destroyed for removal"
3,"HD files, much reading, less looking","As a Harley collector I buy Harley books very often. Therefore I find motorcycle testreports also interresting to have and read. So I ordered HD files of Motorcyclist. The book looks good, has quality paper and many nice reviews.The pictures in this book are of very fine quality too. One problem though. There are not enough of them!!! Even some reviews don't have pictures at all. Also some reviews have the wrong pictures. Example: page 142 should show a 1991 XLH 1200 Sportster. Why a FXDB Sturgis picture here? I don't know.I would say: get the pictures on the right pages (shouldn't be too much work), add several of the specific bikes and details of it (the original reviews have that already I hope), and this book is a winner. The book gets a bit thicker and the price a few bucks more, but that's no problem, right? At least it's complete."
3,SAGE TEA NEEDS A BOOST,"I find that sage tea encourages positive thinking, inspires creative juices to flow, and helps focusing and concentration so I am always on the lookout for it. This one is pure sage, works well but needs a boost especially if one has a so-called sweet tooth and enjoys flavors. I find that adding honey to the tea increases the flavor and thereby makes a great cup of tea without affecting the benefits. [...]"
1,University's Library Book?,"Is it Ok that you sell a University's library book originally? The stump of a universiy on the book you sent! In Japan, that kind of book cannot be sold."
3,Like having a friend tell you her story,"""The Pampered Chef"" is a good weekend read (quick and easy). Doris Christopher describes how she turned a $3,000 investment into a multi-million dollar direct sales business. While weaker than expected as a business resource, I think that the story is inspirational and interesting. It reads like having a friend tell you her story. I will definitely have to check out the company's products.The writing is a bit too repetitive (surprising since she worked with a writer and an editor). I felt like I was reading the same text over. So much so that I had to double check that I hadn't lost my place a couple of times. I hadn't.Along the direct sales line, you might also want to check outAvon: Building The World's Premier Company For WomenandThe Mary Kay Way: Timeless Principles from America's Greatest Woman Entrepreneur."
4,The Pampered Chef Story,"The book, The Pampered Chef, one of America's most beloved companies was very informative and engaging. It brought the reader through the stages of development of the company and gave the reader an inside look at the day to day development and experiences of the author. Anyone reading this book will come away with a greater understanding of the great amount of perseverance it takes to build a multi-million dollar enterprise. The book details the step by step sucesses and near misses of the author as she followed her dream to fruition through hard work and careful risks."
5,Doris Christopher is AMAZING!,"This book is a true inspiration, not just to current or future Pampered Chef Consultants but to anyone who is interested in or just getting started in their own small business. Her courage and determination as well as the tremendous family support system she has is commendable! Thanks for the great book Doris! And thanks for the amazing job you have done with and for The Pampered Chef!"
4,An accessible review of a complicated philosopher,"Levi ben Gershom, better known as Gersonides, or the Ralbag, isn't an easy philosopher to read. Very few of his works have modern translations, and those that do exist are of little help to those without a background in medieval philosophy.For those of us who are interested in the radical theological innovators of the medieval era, such as Gersonides and Maimonides, it is helpful to have a guide such as Eisen's book to guide us through Gersonide's sophisticated arguments. It is concise, well written, helpful, and does not make the mistake of talking down to the reader. A certain amount of intellectual sophistication is assumed on the part of the reader - but I assume that this would be true of anyone who wishes to read Gersonides to begin with!For further reading, I would suggest any of the many journal articles by Menachem Kellner."
2,"Jessica Simpson acting, heck no","This movie has a good premise, but # 1 Jessica Simpson CAN NOT act. The humor was not that funny. there were not any Laugh out Loud moments that I can really recall. Just avoid this movie. this is 2 hours of my life that I may never get backSee Good luck Chuck instead, extremly funny"
3,"Forgettable, but not Awful","This movie captured my attention and held it, but it certainly wasn't a great movie by any means. However, it wasn't bad either. The movie wasn't laugh out loud funny, nor was it suspenseful or anything. It was just a pretty bland, predictable story, that I found to be ""ok"" to watch. I certainly didn't sit there and look at the clock, hoping it would be over soon. But the next day, I forgot I even watched it the day before. It's a forgettable, but reasonably entertaining film."
4,I liked it.,Dane Cook is funny. I liked the movie. I would watch it again and that is a big compliment for me.I recommend it.
1,Where's the exit?,"Employee of the Month is probably the worst film with absolutely the worst plot ever! Dax Shepard of Punk'd is pretty good but Jessica Simpson and Dane Cook, oh boy expect bad acting! I can see why this film got trashed by critics, stay far away from this mess."
5,Good Movie,"Its about this guy who does this thing for over an hour. I laughed, I cried, I ate pop corn"
2,Employee of the Month,"This was OK not as funny as the trailer made it out to be but it was ok, the film did'nt focus as much on Jessica Simpson as the trailer made out it would but ok for an everning in with nothing else to do."
3,Scan this....or don't,"I think Dane Cook is funny, but not so funny here. I felt like someone hit him over the head with a sledge hammer a few times to dumb down his comedy for this flick. There were definitely a few LAUGH OUT LOUD moments in this film, and Andy Dick should take the credit for a few of them, but other than those few moments, this film is boring. The script tries to get all romantic on the viewer, and for one scene, it works (Jessica and Dane getting sweet about big ears), but it's really just a flat comedy about Costco and trying to scan items really fast."
3,Not bad,"It had its funny moments, not the best movie I've ever seen though. Its got Jessica Simpson in it - I didn't expect much... lol"
5,Employee of the Month,"At first i didn't think very much about the plot, but i hoped that it wasn't waste of time. When i started watching it, i just started laughing non-stop!"
1,This movie was bought as a joke - and that's what it is,"Would never actually purchase this movie for myself. It was purchased as a gag gift, kinda since one of my sister's was obsessed with Jessica Simpson. Dane cook a loser and this move probably sucks - I've never watched it."
3,Just 3,"I rated it 3 stars because that's how many good songs were on this cd. I know they were going with the whole AC/DC theme. But, I liked the REAL soundtrack in the movie."
1,lame,"this movie was rather lame, which is a shame cuz now i am stuck with it. the previews made it look like it might be funny, so i ordered it."
1,WHAT CAN I SAY...,"IS NOT BAD FOR A COMEDY BUT JESSICA SIMPSON SHOULD STICK WITH WHAT SHE KNOWS BEST, SINGING. I SAW IT ONCE BUT I WOULD NOT EVEN SPEND MORE MONEY TO BUY IT."
3,If we do not analyze this thing too much.,"As a huge Dane Cook fan this was a must see. Dane and Andy Dick were by far the most funny characters in this flick. But overall it is a film which invites nor needs any analysis and is there just for pure and simple entertainment. It's just a run of the mill, medium strength comedy/"
2,Take Jessica Out and maybe it would have been ok!,"This movie would have been ok except for its casting of Jessica Simpson, but then I looked at the producing list and it was her daddy Joe. So. that is why. The movie was ok. It had a few moments that we kind of funny, but every time that Jessica was on the screen it just went horribly wrong. She would look around at nothing (Cue cards - my guess) and could said maybe 15 things that whole movie. That is awesome that a main charatures can only say about 15 things. You can tell that she is a horrible actress. The whole I am hot, so I can act.. well i guess if I was 15 and a boy. But .. this movie was an excellent rental. NOT WORTH the buy. Save your money for something better."
4,Good for a much needed laugh,"This movie is a great choice if you simply want a stupid movie that you can laugh about and not have to think too hard about the plot. There are many cliche's and overused jokes, but plenty of new jokes and silly conditions that make this the perfect movie to watch if you need a pick-me-up.The movie takes place in a BJ's/Sam's Club warehouse store where massive products are sold in bulk. The ever-present typical slacker decides to pick up the pace and try to give the 17-time employee of the month a run for his money over the new girl working the registers.A definite if you simply need a laugh."
2,"ANDY DICK WAS FUNNY, that's about it :-(",This movie was actually a little worse than I had anticipated. I would never recommend anyone to go see it whatsoever. I am even embarrassed to admit that I have seen it. The only real funny character was Andy Dick. Efren Ramirez' character was a letdown. He should have never added this film to his resume. Napoleon Dynamite would have sufficed.
3,So-so,"Meh, it was okay. Jessica Simpson sucks as an actress. Other than that, it was okay I guess. Nothing really stood out for me in the movie. Nothing good at least."
4,She Makes Nice Shoes Though,"What can you say about a movie with meager ambitions, not unlike the main character played by Dane Cook, and for all intents and purposes succeeds? The laughs are hit or miss (mostly miss but who's counting), the good guys win, the bad guys get comeuppance, Jessica Simpson displays ample cleavage(most likely compensation for being acting challenged) and there's lots of product placement. You just let this one play itself out and put on ""Office Space""."
2,Re-used plot,"Again, we have the down-trodden main character with his his band of far-out, wierd friends. Main character becomes successful and loses friends. In the end, the main character gets the girl and his friends back. LAME. This movie has been done, it's just in a new form, and it's not even funny."
2,"Ripoff Of ""Waiting"" Without The Comedy","""Employee Of The Month"" is a direct ripoff of the movie ""Waiting."" The only difference is ""Waiting"" is actually funny. This movie is about a slacker working at a store that supposed to be like Costco who meets a girl and wants to become Employee Of The Month to impress her. The movie has lots of little one liners that are supposed to be funny, you know their supposed to be funny yet they don't even bring a smirk to your face because they are so used, tired and old. This movie would have some potential if it werent for the horrible writing. If this movie is on TV give it a watch if you have time to kill but don't buy it."
4,Definitely not Office Space..but...,"I watched bits and pieces of this at my theater between running films, and I thought it looked pretty funny. I took a friend from out of state to see it and I thought it WAS really funny. It's definitely no Office Space, and tends to overuse some comedic ideas from past films of this nature, but it's still a very funny and very enjoyable movie. Dane Cook may have been the top billing, but Dax Sheppard definitely stole this film as that overachieving snob in the workplace we all love to hate! Part of me thinks this would have been a much funnier had they gone for an R rating. If you can get past the formulaic film format, it's worth checking out."
2,Unless you feel like getting a boredom headache...,I never expect much from chick flicks. But this one actually hurt my head. I'm all for no-brainer comedies. The kind that takes no cognitive function whatsoever...I find they're good for background noise when magazine reading or painting one's toe nails. Not Employee of the Month. There's about five minutes worth of funny in this movie. The rest of it is a waste of your life. And mine. I don't HATE hate it. But I wouldn't watch it again. Not even for the background noise.
4,Nice comedy but the plot is weak (could be better),"I watched this movie when it came out almost 2 years ago in January 2007 and at the time I had some trouble following the plot. It deals with 2 employees who fight for the prize of employee of the month at a large department store. They are probably paid just a little above minimum wage. There is great acting all around by Dane Cook, Dax Shepard (who I remember from the movie Baby Mama), and especially Jessica Simpson. Jessica Simpson who is the current employee of the month plays her character very gracefully.The part that I found funniest in the movie was the race to clean up a spill and where all the employees crash head on; that was a real hoot! I recommend this movie if you are looking for a funny comedy, but I have to say that the plot is weak and hard to follow. I would actually give the movie 3.5 stars."
3,"GOOD COMEDY, ANDY DICK STEALS THE SHOW!","I liked this movie,but I must admit, I thought it would be funnier! Andy Dick made me laigh a few times and the light hearted romantic comedy is OK. If your a fan of the people in the movie,you'll probably like it. I am and I did!"
4,funny,"this movie was pretty funny, it was okay, dane cook is a funny guy. it was kind of stupid plot but thats what makes these type of movies funny. they could've picked a more hotter chick than jessica simpson, like(Jessica Alba). we'll all in all this movie was okay."
1,Just Trash and nothing but trash,No thought went into the making of this loser of a DVD. The acting was unacceptable and it looks as if there was an effort to not cut the film at all but use every foot of film shot. This only reason I am wasting my time doing this review is to save others from wasting their money and precious time on this utter TRASH. The only notable goal attained by this thing is that it might be used in the future as an example of the worst movie ever made.STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
1,EMI Gold imported...very good Content Protection,"What can I say....I couldn't listen or play a single tune. The disc 'Greatest Number 1's Ever' is unplayable and unsuitable in my pc based home entertainment system.Stamp on the case it states, 'Content Protected'. Totally unacceptable"
5,sexy and smart,"This is a sexy, lighthearted book with pictures and writing that ranges from gorgeous to goofy.A fun book for couples as well as to look over alone or with a friend.A lot of the pictures appear in other erotic anthologies, but the presentation here is worth the buy."
2,Not for Sensitive Skin,"The Pre De Provence Milk Soap smells nice and is good for washing your hands, but be careful if you are looking for a body soap. This soap is not good for sensitive skin. I was looking for a soap made only with natural ingredients, so the name of the soap is somewhat misleading. It is made ""with"" natural herbs, but this only means the natural herbs are added to the main ingredients rather than only containing natural herbs. If you are looking for a natural soap that is good for sensitive skin, Pre De Provence Milk Soap is not recommended."
4,awesome find,"cant believe i found this, and for 1 penny. Was a gag gift for a friend who has an infatuation with alonzo moruning and this couldn't have been more perfect of a gift."
4,great once assembled,"Sturdy, functional, and American-made. Unfortunately there are several permutations on how it can be assembled and I got off on the wrong track more than once. Only one of these occasions was the fault of the instructions, however. One also needs the optional electrical cord and plug-in strip, not included with this item."
1,Garbage,"I'm a fan of memphis rap but this man is garbage and the Three 6 diss song is just an attempt to get noticed by people. Pat is average skilled rapper and his songs are garbage, you know u suck when the people u diss don't bother responding to you or your diss. Their is a lot of talent in memphis but not Gangsta Pat."
4,One true Barry Classic missed of this would be a 5 Star,As an owner of all of Barry's recordings I can truly say this falls one star short by not including Barry's best recording JUST ANOTHER WAY TO SAY I LOVE YOU.
3,Four Tops in the early 80's,"I have one of the original albums which featuresWhen She Was My Girl, Tonight I'm Gonna Love You All Over, Don't Walk Away, Dream On, All I Do, I'll Never Ever Leave Again and a few others. The name of the album is Tonight!. The thing is it's excellent music but it's too much of the same thing. The songs are all too similar. But it is worth getting if you are a FOur Tops fan or a fan of early 80's music."
2,This one's a sleeper!,"Overall, the songs on this CD are mediocre at best, with the exception of ""When She Was My Girl"" and ""Back To School Again"", from the motion picture ""Grease 2"". Frankly, the majority of the other songs put me to sleep, which is why I prefer the 'Tops music from the Motown and Dunhill/ABC eras. Pass on this one for the most part."
2,Look Carefully,"Wow, did I make a mistake. I was expecting the original recordings of ""Hush, ""Space Trucking,"" etc. Unfortunately, I didn't find them here. These are RE-RECORDINGS that add a horrible '80s sound. Yes, I should have paid more attention to the subtitle of this CD. Oh well, live and learn."
4,4 stars,"sweet lucy was a dancer but none of us a chancer because she was a samurai!!! from the first song you will remember one track form the album Perfect strangers 1984.The band had disappeared from the international Rock-scene after their final album 1975 with the death of Tommy Bolin back in 1976. Led Zeppelin & Black Sabbath also experienced their final days, both were also coming to an end 4 years later. In 1984 the Reformation of Deep Purple Mark II (V) was a huge success in the US, Japan, Australia and Europe. This album is a compilation of Perfect strangers, house of blue light and nobodys perfect albums...you will not doubt them."
4,Some great hits here!,"This may not have been the best decade for Deep Purple but this Cd has great songs such as Child in Time, Smoke on the Water, and Hush. Okay buy, but not Puplre's best! Want the best buy Machine Head!"
2,"Commercial release, if something is","It's amazing how a great band like The Purple can do so lame music inthe 80's. Making a ""best of""- compilation out of nothing isn't a very good idea, is it? The only good songs on this album were made in the 70's and are here because of the live album Perfect Strangers. Just admit it, will ya!"
4,Works as advertised,"Connected this to a Yamaha 2010 to take the place of a previous receiver's switched plug. Although connection was fairly easy, it would be better if it had a 3.5mm plug as that's the cable used to connect to thte reciever. Works flawlessly."
3,temporary fix,"Used it to turn on and off a secondary ampifier from my Yamaha receiver. Worked well for three weeks, now only sometimes turns it on and then when on does not always turn it off"
5,Great Product Great Service,i combined this item with24 Volt AC to 12V DC Power Converter Reducer Adaptor (DSC-AD01)now it is now low voltage AC can trigger this great device
3,Lasted longer than normal,"The jeans are a good fit because of the adjustable waist. They lasted for 3 months on the knees rather than just 1.5-2 months. With a reinforced knee, I was hoping for more than 3 months. However, I do have a little boy that is constantly on knees for playing or when coming in for a sliding stop."
3,"Not really ""double knee.""","The fit and finish is good. Though, the ""double knee"" is really just an extra, very thin, layer of something seemingly ironed in on the inside of the pant leg. I'd much rather have the extra layer on the outside. How many six-year-olds wear out their knees from the inside?As durable kids pants go these are OK but I'm not going out of my way to buy them again. I'm still searching for a true double knee pant."
2,the snap didn't stand up to initially trying on.,"I ordered these especially for my slightly chunky grandson. He has trouble finding jeans that fit and don't ""squeeze"" his little 5-year old belly. The snap came apart with the first attempt to wear. when I looked at the snap, I could see the head of the snap was bent, as though the maker had done a poor job of situating the snap when adding it to the jeans. I haven't had time to contact Amazon about this, but I plan to return them for a replacement."
2,False Advertising!!,The pants that are shown are carpenter style. Pants you get are not.I still Like the pants just wish they were carpenter style.
3,No Great Shakes,"Although I have not yet quite forgiven Delos for pulling the plug on their David Diamond recording project in favor of more ""popular"" recordings of classical music, I will give them credit for letting John Eargle record Mahler, which he has done in the VR2 process. Unfortunately, the performance here is no great shakes, at least to these ears. I still far prefer the majesty of Klemperer on EMI and the straightforward sincerity of Abravanel on Vanguard.This disk was meant to be auditioned in a surround system setup. In standard stereo, it sounds fine -- I wished for more dynamics, but I think that was a function of the performance, not the recording. Sigh..."
3,misses in recording,This was supposed to be a new standard in recording but apart from the near perfect recording of the orchestra the chorus recording (on my CD) is disastrous. If I had known that I would never have bought it and would have waited for the Chailly recording.
3,ok but not great,"This watch has one major problem. The number 13 sounds exactly as the number 30. The number 14 sounds exactly like the number 40. The number 15 sounds exactly like the number 50; and well you get the idea. You can't tell if it is 5:13 or 5:30. It's rather annoying. It would also be nice if they had included a stop watch function. I just can't seem to ever find the ideal talking watch. I would be willing to pay more for a high quality talking watch but, it doesn't seem to be out there."
3,Too simplistic,"I know this is intended to be very simple, but the commentary is just too simple. It asks questions or states facts that are nearly identical to what the actual text of the constitution reads. This would be a good book for kids, and it is still a good buy if you just want to have a hard copy of the constitution on hand. But in general, I don't think the commentary added anything to the original text."
2,needs serious revision,"I was less than impressed with this ""analysis"" of our Constitution. This guy was a junior high school teacher and he must have started the ""dumbing down"" of our American society. The Only reason why I bought the book was it was required reading for a teacher test that is given by a government school system and I need to take the test for a credential. At least it has a copy of the actual document in the back half of the book.My ""Revised and Updated Edition"" was last revised two presidential terms ago and we have raised salaries for the states government jobs and the new Cabinet position of Secretary for Homeland Security are not in the book. The latter has somewhat ""juggled"" the succession for president and that should be noted as well.My suggestion...skip this book unless required by a class and even then, suggest a different title."
4,The Constitution,This booklet helps explain our founding documents. Everyone in the US should read it.
4,Good Book,This book has help me in understanding routing in general. I wished the author went more indepth on BGP and OSPF.
3,Dry...,"As expected, right? However it does cover the basic routing protocols that you *need* to know about. (take that sarcastically)A good reference...but not the kind of book you want to take with you on the plane."
2,No Food Storage Bin,"Unlike the description states, this product has no food storage bin. I was disappointed upon receiving this, especially for its price. I intend to return it. I do not feel also that this product is worth the $35.00 -- although the wood is strong and the plates are indeed stoneware. Mainly, I was sad to get it and discover no food storage bin. I am not sure why it would say that. Also, there were NO instructions to assemble, product info, material sheets, etc inside -- just the parts and bowls."
1,Poor Quality,The product looked very cute online. When I opened the box I could tell that it was a piece of junk because the paint was already peeled off the side of the stand. Very cheaply made and very over priced for it.
5,AWESOME!!!,"Beautiful necklace! Prettier than the picture! Great customer service as well. I emailed them, and responded within 4 hours--even on a Sunday! Perfect gift!"
5,Very nice!,"This was a gift for a friend. She loved it! I inspected it when it arrived, before I gave it to her, and I found myself wishing that I had gotten one for myself as well."
4,pretty,"not so sure the hinge is going to last but i like the design and weight, i have not put pictures in it yet and i am not sure how the pictures will stay in there is nothing to keep them in, i would imagine you just have to make sure the pictures fit tightly"
2,Nice Locket,"I got this for my wife as a present. She loved the locket, sadly the chain is very frail and broke after about 10 days. If purchasing understand that chain will probably need to be replaced."
5,Top notch currency holder,"I ordered these and they were delivered the next day. I wanted something I could use to display Honduran lempira bills as a gift to our friends who donated money to our mission trip to Honduras. These are great quality, heavy duty sleeves! I was really pleased with them and very glad I chose these over the many other options. The fit for the lempira bills is just perfect (6.5x3) and they were easy to load into the sleeves."
4,Great buy for the price - $10.76,Ineeded a cheap set of speakers to listen to tutorials with so i went and bought these but i have to say i now use them in my office to listen to music and i really love them.
3,"OK, for the money","Just bought these speakers and, compared with my Dell computer supplied Harmon/Kardon speakers, these lack the full depth of sound that I was used to.Don't buy these speakers if you want superior sound. The sound is ""good"" at best!"
5,Best darn speakers,I would like to say that these are the best darn speakers I've ever had for my computer. I have a Sound Blaster sound card and these speakers are made by the same company. They seemed to be matched to the sound card because the sound great. I would also like to say that I received them in no time at all.
3,OK for the Price,"I've always used computer speakers with a subwoofer, so maybe my expectations were a little skewed, but I was somewhat disappointed with these speakers given the solid reviews.They sound fairly hollow, and obviously lack any type of halfway decent bass. They are ok for everyday computer sounds and use, but if I were going to be listening to a lot of music, I'd probably get something better.For the price though I can't complain too much. There is better, there is worse."
5,Great service,Thanks for the great service; the speakers were received in a timely fashion and work great.
3,Good one,Its good for Office use as it is not having any woofer and you can play music where you dont need high volume.
5,Great bass and tremble combination,Great price for great item. I got a creative plat sound card to go with it.
1,Not good with MP3 player,"Bought these to experiment with my Creative Zen (which is excellent). Sound is tinny, lacking power, bass... pretty much everything. Will return and purchase Altec Lansings like I should have done in the first place."
4,Nice Basic Speakers.,"These speakers are a step up from the crappy ones that comes with basic PC's. They have decent bass and treble. They won't turn your room or office into a dance studio. You'd have to pay a little bit more money for that kind of sound. Personally, I use headphones, and the sound that goes in to a good pair of them is greatIf you need a quick pair of PC Speakers with good enough sound, and headphone support, then go for these."
4,great for the price,"the price is cheap and the speakers look and work well. don't expect quality from the next room, but for sitting at your computer they have good sound for this price range."
5,SBS260 speakers,I've had these speakers for a short time and like them very much. Sound quality is very good and the price is unbeatable. They even look nice on my desk. A great buy.
4,Very good for the price,"It doesn't have spectacular bass power, but I am happy for the product I got at such a feasible price"
5,Good sound quality for a cheap price!,"Same as many of the other reviewers, I didn't expect much from these speakers considering how cheap they are. But when I got it I was impressed by the sound quality. If you're like me and just want a regular set of speakers for your pc, this set does an incredible job."
4,Great sound for the price,"I didn't expect much considering how inexpensive they are, but when I started using them I was pleased with the quality of the sound."
5,For $10.76 -- Awesome speakers,"They're light weight, but give a nice airy sound. Probably not for heavy metal, but for acoustic, classical & podcasts they're just great. It's also nice to have a headphone jack very accessible on the front, and an easy-to-use volume control. Under $11, no tax, Amazon Prime shipping -- it makes one wonder how they make any money at this."
4,PERFECT DESKTOP OR LAPTOP SPEAKER,THESES SPEAKERS ARE PERFECT FOR ANY TYPE OF COMPUTER.THEY ARE WELL MADE.SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT FOR THERE SIZE AND POWER.THEY ARE CHEAP AS WELL.A WELL MADE HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT.GREAT BUY NEW OR USED.
5,Best Cheap Computer Speakers I Have Owned,"I have bought several different sets of cheap computer speakers (among these Philips and Altec Lansing), and these Creative SBS260 are the best of all of them by far. Where normally the sound of computer speakers is flat and distorted, these little wonders give a very precise and wonderfully clear sound. To boot these speakers are nice and small, and look great.I use these speakers to watch DVDs on my computer, and the only thing I could wish for is a bigger screen: the sound quality is perfect thanks to these speakers."
5,solid,My office is on the 9th floor. I tried out two different models of speakers in the $50-$100 range and was very upset by the radio static. Then I picked up this set. There's no static and beautiful sound. Good job Creative!
2,"Decent Speakers For the Price, Can't Hit Those Low Notes","Recently, my Altec Lansing $20 cheap speakers conked out after 2 years. I had really enjoyed them for the price so I figured another set of cheap ones would work. I stumbled upon these and figured they were a good choice after reading the reviews. The major pro is the price, point blank. Easy to set up, and they were dirt cheap.However, if I were to do it all again, I would have dropped another few bucks. The major flaw is the low frequencies. It doesn't hit them and have the power to make them sound good. My old speakers had a tone nob which would have really helped these speakers. In addition, they feel really cheap. They don't seem like they will hold up in the long run, but time will tell on that one.Overall, you might do well to drop a few more bucks if you want listen to any music with any amount of bass."
2,Slave Species of the gods,"This book is long-winded, and very boring at times. It's more opinion than fact, more fantasy and wishful thinking than reality. The author has more assumptions about life on earth than truth. His writing is speculative, poorly presented and not convincing at all. I was very disappointed in his translations of the Bible, which were mediocre. He claims to know exactly what God is thinking and what man was thinking thousands of years ago, so there's a sure sign that this author is a fiction writer. He doesn't understand that human nature is not a text book reference. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Further study,"I feel it is important to check out where these ideas and facts are coming from before forming an opinion about this book. Please check out Michael Tellinger's biography yourself. He has information about himself and his book available on www.slavespecies.com. Be aware that Mr. Tellinger has been a professional entertainer and not a scholar for the last 25 years. This is not to say that he is not asking interesting questions, he is. I am only pointing out that his opinions and conclusions are as qualified as an actor or singer and are not coming from someone with a doctorate in archeology or any other science."
4,"Hard Core Christians, need not apply......","Thought provoking. He has put into words what I have been thinking about for a long time! Since I was small I looked at the stars and wondered WHO was out there, not What! Tellinger certainly puts a convincing amount of info out for you to think about. Yes, he gets bogged down a couple of times and yes, he's obviously not too happy about G.W., but if you can overlook the times he gets a bit off track,(I call it ""filler"") it's a fascinating book. More and more evidence from other sources is beginning to support this theory of our creation. Suppressed, of course, by our Imperial Federal Government, BUT just imagine world chaos that would ensue if all this were proven true!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped,I have read all of the Sitchin books and was hoping for a similar but individual take on the subject. However it seems that most of the author's information comes from Sitchin anyway. I'm glad I read it but can't really recommend it unless you are a Sitchin fan and have run out of Annunaki books to read. And the Bush bashing is totally out of place. Tellinger compares President Bush to Hitler and Stalin who murdered 6 million and 18 million people respectively. No one is a fan of war but comparing someone who is trying to make world a safer place to those who committed genocide is ridiculous.
1,No!,"I bought this book because I was looking for more information about the unknown history of our origins after reading books written by Brandon Levon titled ""Old World Secrets the Omega Project Codes (3rd edition)and ""New World Bible The Story of the Truth. I was very disappointed after finding out the author did not seem to know much of anything about our history. If you want to know how it all started, who is behind it all, how it works and what they are planning read Levon's books, Your life will never be the same. Their levels of deception are brilliant."
5,One of the best books out there!,This is one of the best books I have read. By the time I had purchased this book I had already read some of Zecharia Sitchin's works and when I finished reading Slave species of god I knew the ancient texts concerning the Anunnaki and their time on planet earth were important historical documents.William James author ofZero Point: Power of the Gods
3,Not what I expected...,"This book is not at all what I expected. I would not buy it again.First of all, this is a new book so I was looking for something beyond what Zecherin Sitchin had been putting out since the 1980's. First disappointment...Second you have to go through political drivel such as the glorifying of Nelson Mandela. And repeated anti-American statements such as when measurements are given in metrics there will be a statement such as ""for you people in America that is..."". Or implying the looting of the Bagdad Museum was the fault of a certain American president. Or such as on page 137, stating America invades other countries so it can take jobs away from local peoples.Pass this one by unless you like reading rabid anti-American drivel."
4,Melodic but dark,A wonderful series of songs. Melodic and melancholic harmonies. A close listen reveals some dark and disturbing lyrics.
5,An underrated joy,"I first heard tracks from Hank Dogs' ""Bareback"" while I was in my car, listing to the public radio show ""World Cafe"". I was so captivated by both the lyrics and the harmonies, I sat in my garage, waiting until the set had completed. I ordered the CD the next day.Their sound is so personal and down-to-earth, it suggests that you are listening to them in the local pub, surrounded by good friends and good drink.While their talent deserves the adoration of countless fans, I would love to see them in a small venue."
5,When is the next one ?,Wonderful album. good mix - from lucky break - reunion and one from your head.....terrific harmonies ....when is the next one ?
5,Mesmerizing!,"I first heard several selections on World Cafe Program on my local public radio station and was captivated. I bought the CD on a whim and have practically worn it out.The entire CD is mesmerizing, haunting and addictive. I have bought it and recommended it several people. The vocals are amazing and the lyrics are poetic. Its hard to imagine that there are only three people in the group, the sound is so lush.If you like Mazzy Star, the Sundays, the Cowboy Junkies or are just a fan of folk music, you should definitely give this a try. Play it though entirely and just try not to hit repeat!"
4,Folk Rock That Bites!,"Folk music often gets a bad name because it emphasizes lyrical profundity over musicianship and frequently comes off as quite wimpy. No such problem with The Hankdogs' ""Bareback,"" which is as lyrically tough as any folk album ever recorded. The song ""18 Dogs"" for example fantasizes about the viscious killing of strangers who are up to no good. Lead singer and songwriter Piano (now THERE's an original name) compliments her strong vocals with decent songs and lyrics that will keep you on your toes. The highlights include the opening ""Lucky Break,"" the gorgeous yet haunting ""I'm an Angel,"" and ""One From Your Head."" The one drawback is that at 14 songs and nearly an hour of running time it can wear the listener out.Overall, an eye opening album from a band that has revitalized the folk rock form."
5,Very Exciting and very tense,"This is a very good Manga! I am collecting them all and so far I have 1-7 ^.^. This took me by surprise, and is very different from the anime. If you like Sailor Moon and you've never read the manga I would advise you to start with Sailor Moon Vol. 1 which can be found on here and go and collect through 8 I believe. Then it starts out SuperS and Stars, and the rest she hasn't written yet! Be patient :)Ayeka"
3,"Too girly, but still a very good book.","This is MUCH better than the anime. It has beautiful artwork, and an interesting plot. The only problem is that the plot doesn't totally flow, and is way too girly and unrealistic for my tastes. I would rate it 5 stars, but I've read much better manga. (Such as Neon Genesis Evangelion). Still, if you like the anime I STRONGLY urge to read this to see the way it was originally intended. When I say it is unrealistic, I mean that the characters are unrealistic. That is just my opinion."
5,"a great book, good pics. and storyline.","a great book, good pics. and storyline. way diffrent from the T.V. show. More romantic and better pics. A little weird if you didn't read the first vol, first. hope you enjoy the book as much as i did. P.S. If you want some pics and more info on the sailors. Just e-mail me."
5,Sad and romantic...a girl's gotta love it!,"The second book in the manga series is twice as good as the first one. Like my title says, it's sad and romantic, but mostly sad. For all you Sailor V/Venus fans, she makes her debut in this comic, so its a must-have for you! Hope you enjoy it as I did. I just can't wait to go back to Books-A-Million (BAM) and buy the third one!"
5,Sailor Moon Novel #2,"Wonderful! This one reveals the fabled Moon Princess after a fake-out. An awesome book which introduces Sailor Venus as the leader of the scouts. If you liked the first book in this series, you'll love this one. The artwork is gorgeous!"
1,Straight into the Garbage,Don't even think about buying this product unless you already know what it smells like. It is a nasty sweet powdery smell that reminds me of Charmin toilet paper. I could not even get it off of me with soap and water. What was Monsieur Jacomo thinking when he made this travesty ?!?!?! I did not even want to return it so that nobody else has to smell this nastiness. Straight into the garbage it went. I paid $20 to learn never buy a fragrance based upon internet reviews unless your nose was already there. You have been warned.
3,Spray,"I couldn't use it ,because I had gotten headache.I had contacted the seller to return the product ,but they were not ready to accept it."
5,"Weimar Culture, The Outsiders as Insiders","The purchase arrived as described and is in fine order, also as described. Condition is also as described... goood job."
3,About what it says of the film Dr. caligari,It claims the mistaken wrong story. That the Caligari filmmakers wanted to end it with Caligari getting captured but that they were forced to change this and build a frame story around the whole thing in which most of the story is simply the ravings of Francis (an asylum inmate). Wrong Peter. Actually there was originally a frame story around the entire Caligari adventure in which Fancis and Jane(remember her?) were at a picnic and they told the story in flashback. On other matters I like the humourous bits (like the one about Marlene Dietrich's legs implying her legs were sexy and they were to men).
4,The Gift of the Acorn...makes a great gift,This sweet little book makes a great gift for friends...in a simple story format The Gift of the Acorn tells us all that love sprouts from our hearts. Sometimes we just need a reminder and The Gift of the Acorn does just that!
5,A simple message,"This is a great book, and the message is so pure and simple that even my young children like to hear it again and again! It's a good bedtime story, yet it's powerful enough for adults as well. It doesn't take long to read, but the story stays with you for a long time."
4,Fine silent comedy that's still laughable,"Most silent comedies tend to hold up better than dramas, particualrly the later ones where the camerawork isn't as jerky. This contains some fine little-known work. The pre-hardy Stan Laurel does a hilarious turn as a drunk caught in a compromising position with another man's wife. The forgotten Billy Richie is wildly funny as a knave who deliberately cheats on his wife and suffers the consequences. Another little-known comic, Lupino Lane, does an excellent turn in a one man, multi-character performance. As for Chaplin, even non-Chaplin fans like me will like ""The Rink"" and ""A Night at the Show."" These films show that filmed comedies had a splendid beginning."
4,Dream Story,"This book was in good shape with just some writing in it. It turns out Eyes Wide Shut was quite close to the book, mostly just a different time period among other differences."
4,An indispensable companion to Eyes Wide Shut,"It may be odd to cite a source work for its value as a companion to the film made from it, but I suspect that few contemporary readers would otherwise have an interest in Schnitzler's Mittel-European novela. On the other hand, for Kubrick aficionados, particularly those who admire ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" it is fascinating to compare the book to the film, and that makes the book indispensable. Other reviewers have here commented upon Kubrick's decision to omit the references to anti-Semitism in ""Dream Story,"" and it makes all those Christmas trees in the film even more interesting. The term ""Kafkaesque"" will come up in the mind of the reader of this work and serve to deepen our understanding of the extent to which Kubrick's entire opus can be said to be an examination of the dream realms."
4,"An Erudite Work, Illuminating the Shadows of an Arcane Field","In their most recent collaborative effort, ""Cryptozoology A to Z: The Encyclopedia of Loch Monsters, Sasquatch, Chupacabras, and Other Authentic Mysteries of Nature"", authors Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark have shed a much-needed light on an often misunderstood field and its personalities.At once both compelling and fascinating in its detail and broad scope of coverage, ""Cryptozoology A-Z"" is destined to become the spark which kindles the imagination of a whole new generation of inquisitive minds. With biographies of the giants and not so giant in the field, past and present, as well as descriptions of cryptids both well-known and obscure this book is a fascinating tribute to an often maligned scientific realm.It will surely be frequently referenced for years to come. Bravo."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark's Cryptozoology A to Z: The Encyclopedia of Loch Monsters, Sasquatch, Chupacabras, and Other Authentic Mysteries of Nature, is truly a book for the die hard cryptozoologist fan. The book reads more like a dictionary of terms rather than a book discussing legends and myths behind the many cryptids listed. Cryptozoology A to Z is neatly organized, and presents all the material alphabetically. Although an interesting book to read, it seems to focus more on the idea that crypids are serious members of the animal kingdom, rather than discussing their obscurity from general public knowledge."
3,"Too many people, not enough info on some","As I said in the title, there are way too many cryptozoologist entries in this book. We really don't care about half of these people. A lot of the Bigfoot type creatures are mentioned again and again too. A better way to do it would be to have all the names of one cryptid together. That being said most of the key stories or the most famous sightings are mentioned. Many of the lesser known cryptids make appearances as well. A fun read for anyone interested in the topic."
4,Not Entirely Unknown,"Covers the people and creatures. Some are given as historical references (some animals well known today were considered mythical as little as a century ago), most are as-yet unrecognized and unclassified species, a few are shown as not tenable. Various categories which include mystery creatures of the sea (giant turtles were of greatest interest to me), mystery primates, and mystery cats. Very interesting book, a handy reference, if anything seems too short."
4,Decent Book wish there was more infomation...,"Decent book wish there was more information, loved reading it though just wished they went into more detail."
4,Good for those with a beginner's interest,"I am not a real science-type person, but I am interested in the Unknowns of this planet. I found a lot more in this book beyond the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot, which I thought was really great. I had no idea so many different(and identical)hidden animals had been reported through the ages around the world! The only thing I didn't like was the authors kept talking about several pieces of photographic evidence collected on different creatures throughout the book and then never presented them. I would have been very interested in seeing all these photos they mentioned, so I could make some judgements for myself. Otherwise, it has a lot of really good text information that can be expanded upon in further books."
2,Fortunately or unfortunately......,"Fortunately or unfortunately, many Cryptozoologists from A to Z will not find their names or contributions mentioned in ""Cryptozoology A to Z"". The field of Cryptozoology was born out by years of tedious trials, and efforts by many bearing the title of ""Cryptozoologist"" who shall, in this book, remain virtually unknown. The book is a good primer for Crypto-zoo starters."
2,I recommend reading alongside notable critiques,"There is no doubt that Professor Hamburger is a reputable scholar; however, his thesis in this particular book has received a number of notable critiques. I recommend reading Hamburger's work alongside the following articles:1. John Witte Jr. (2003) ""That Serpentine Wall of Separation,"" Michigan Law Review 101: 1869.2. Kent Greenawalt (2005) ""History as Ideology: Philip Hamburger's 'Separation of Church and State,""' California Law Review 93: 3673. T. Jeremy Gunn (2012) ""The Separation of Church and State versus Religion in the Public Square: The Contested History of the Establishment Clause,"" in T. Jeremy Gunn and John Witte, Jr. eds., ""No Establishment of Religion: America's Original Contribution to Religious Liberty. New York: Oxford, pp. 15-44."
3,Hamburger isn't steak,"Hamburger's book seems overly thorough in making extended analyses of the many major elements of the Church/State history of America. In many cases there was little risk that a critic would argue the points that he made, and made, and remade. Sometimes less is more.In general, he makes a persuasive presentation of what happened and the causes therof. A+ on technical data, less so on making his points succinctly."
3,Thought-Provoking but Somewhat Disappointing,"The idea of ""separation of church and state"" today is in much debate as those on the religious right accuse the secularization of America for countless social ills, and recent decisions such as the controversial ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance and subsequent mass public outcry demonstrate exactly why the issues Mr. Hamburger discusses are so important in today's society.The historical analyses are indeed interesting but do seem somewhat revisionistic in nature, such as the idea that the founding fathers ""didn't really intend for strict separation""--what they meant is certainly up for debate, but the changing interpretations of the First Amendment are the very nature of our government, not a ""myth"" invented later in history.Overall, the book to me seems somewhat slanted to the idea that the state and church (namely, the Christian church) need not be so cleanly divided as has been recent policy, but it is nonetheless an interesting read."
1,Disappointed!,"I ordered this DVD, but it was not included in the sealed package. I had seen this movie On Demand and really liked it. I was disappointed to discover that a DVD could not be sent to me...that a refund had to be issued."

4,"For what it is, it's pretty good","Guys, Ruki Vverx is not trying to be DDT, Butusov, or Kino. They're just a pop group. And for a Russian pop group, they're pretty good. Some of the songs are pretty stupid, but the music is always ""bumpin"" and I'd rather hear Ruki vverx on russkoe radio than other trash.Vse. Kupi. Poslushai. Otdixai."
5,Great for tight spaces,"These claws do the job in places that are awkward to use a rake. They are also easier to store, and using them provides a variation on the type of exercise I get when I rake leaves."
4,Leaf Scoops,"These are a great idea. Works well, especially with fall leaves. They are actually sturdier than I thought they would be for the price. With the low price and a bit of skepticism, I ordered two sets. Will probably give one set as a gift since they are better quality than I anticipated."
4,Thanks Amazon; Good Products.,"These make me look like some kind of lawn lobster, but they work very well, and it's sure easier on my back to pick up leaves and twigs using them. I also purchased the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket and I wish I had gotten both years ago."
5,"Great, great, great!!","These lawn claws were incredibly useful to us. We just bought a home with a decent size lot that is surrounded by trees. The claws helped us to scoop large amounts of leaves and general garden waste in a really short amount of time; we filled about 30 to 35 large recyclable leaf bags. The claws turned an onerous job into something very bearable. We're happy to be done for this year, but we'll definitely be using them again... Great product!"
5,Efficient leaf pick up,These leaf scoops do make the task of picking up leaves a more efficient one. Can grab and compress so much more with the scoops than with hands or upturned rake. Makes the tedious task of fall leaf clean-up considerably faster and a easier.
1,Not worth it,"I purchased these based on the rave reviews. Waste of money. First, they are made of very thin plastic and are too flimsy. Second, the little elastic band is a pain to put on every time you drop the rake to use them. Basically, it feels like you are using two plastic coffee can lids with pieces of elastic for handles."
3,Itw okay,This kind of works but a pair of leather gloves works better. I have not found these to be very useful
4,Functional and useful,"I bought these for my mom, who's an avid gardener. She is always moving piles of debris and leaves and is very excited to have this help. The only pitfall is that the straps are stretching and are not very tight. You have to grip tightly so that they do not slip off. However, wearing garden gloves will likely help."
3,Helpful,Not bad. Alot easier that doing it with just hands. Teeth work well as a rack. It compliments the leaf shredder well.
3,Newer version is better,"This is a good product, but the elastic bands don't last. There are newer versions with molded plasic handles that work much better and for a cheaper price. I found some at our local hardware store for $6.00. They are thicker, sturdier and are semi curved to help scoop the leaves. Here are two links. Hopes this helps.Gardex LS-1000 Poly Hand Held Leaf Scoops, Leaf Scoops"
3,Lawn claws,"These work very well for picking up leaves ,etc but I have my doubts about theelastic hand bands. I don't think they will last very long. I like the productand would recommend them to a friend."
4,Midwest gloves,"They are ok, kind of hard to stup down, but it is ok. Ok, twenty words, what else can I say about this item. I used them a while and they work fine."
3,Lawn Claws Leaf Scoops,For $10.00 these are worth the money. They make picking up leaves very easy & quick. So easy to use & work great gathering up leaves or whatever you need cleaning up in the yard. Only drawback is tips will wear down quickly on concrete.
3,SO SO,"I DIDN'T LIKE THESE MUCH. THE ELASTIC HANDLES MAKE FOR A SLOPPY GRIP. I'M PUZZLED BY ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. I FOUND THESE HARD TO MANAGE. MY HANDS KEPT SLIPPING OUT. INEXPENSIVE, BUT NOT GOOD QUALITY."
5,Awesome product.,This makes picking dead leaves easier and actually kinda fun. My wife and son also prefers using this than a rake.
3,What I was looking for,"These are what I was looking for, at a reasonable price.Pros:Cheapnestle together for storage on a single nail or hookdo work to make your hand biggerworks well with one one hand and rake, or together to clam-shell debris.Cons:strap for holding on your hand is weak, almost inadequate. Needs a better strap.possibly should have a knob or handle to grab for better controlbe ready for lots of stooping."
4,RAWR!,"You can pretend to be a bear with these! Anyhow, they work as expected and I haven't snapped any of the tines off yet. For grass I wind up scraping with one, into the other. They don't get to sit in the garage with my other failed purchases. I have even used them on the gutter by the curb to clean up the leafy, watery mess that forms out there after it rains. The hand straps could be a little more beefy, but they work fine for getting them on or off quickly."
5,makes yard work easier,"My mother-in-law gave me a pair of these years ago. They have been one of the best and most-used gifts that I have ever received. I searched for some to give my sons who now have homes of their own. When I found them, I bought myself another set as well. I never want to do yard work again without a pair. This particular brand and design are better than other similar products."
4,lawn claws,These are great gadgets. After raking up leaves and yard debris I have to fumble with the large rake. These work great. Gave them as Christmas gifts.
4,better than expected,"Initial impression was disappointment given how small the claws appeared. That faded however because, if they were bigger (and you could mightly get more leaves), you would have great difficulty in placing it in any standard leaf bag. As a bonus (the better than expected part), the not-to-big size allowed my 4 yr old to take care of the leaf piles pretty well. The only negative is the straps. You're not always holding the claws cymbal-like (ie perfectly parallel to each other). Often you're holding them in a V pattern, at a slight angle: would have been nice to have 2 straps on each claw: one for the 4 fingers, the other for the thumb. Minor though, given the new found eagerness of the 4yo."
4,My daughter loves them !!!!!,I bought these for my daughter to help pay back Dad for the purchase of Jonas Brother tickets. We ended up picking up 20 bushels of leaves in no time. They clean off and store away easily.
2,So close to being a great product,"So close to being a good product, but misses. A good concept, poor execution. They work fairly well on dry leaves, but not much else. Wet leaves, pine straw or cones, hedge trimmings, grass clippings? These are just too lightweight to do the job. Others have mentioned the cheap elastic, which adds to the overall disappointment."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The image really looks like a ceramic plate, with mottled edges, but these are melamine. The item description should have mentioned that."
5,A TIGHT Success!,"I was hooked into Patrick's fictional world first through ""The Way It Is"" and am now happy to have indulged in Tight. It's so hilarious, yet pulls at your heartstrings too. Patrick has such a wicked and cool sense of humor and a magical way of weaving stories. I was seriously sad at the end of the book because I missed having these characters in my life! Tight is a five-star book and I highly suggest picking up a copy, as well as his other titles!"
2,Goin' Commercial,"Aerosmith was one of the most important bands of the 1970's hard rock/heavy metal scene. But in the early 80's, their albums sales began to slip. But the made a so-called comeback in the late eighties. But they completely abandoned the rough, raw sound for a commercial atrocity. They thought they could pull off being a glam band. Believe me, they don't have the looks for it. This ain't even rock anymore. This is just pure commercial pop/rock. This is pathetic. Janie's Got A Gun is okay, but if your'e expecting Toys In The Attic, your'e not gonna get it here."
2,Noisy,"This is a noisy album, with Steven Tyler's annoying screams from beginning to end. There are no riffs, everything is covered by a wall of noise, distortion. The songs by themselves are no bog deal, and there is absolutely NOTHING here that can be compared with TOYS IN THE ATTIC and ROCKS."
2,not so good,i like the music but the lyrics are not so good ... they are made for little girls! this was one of my first albums!
1,Dire Straits is better,"This album has not put up on me at all. This album had too manysongs that have screaming and yelling in it. Aerosmith were totally better in the 70's. The reason I got this album is because Janie's Got a Gun was one of my favorite songs of all time. Other than that, the songs were just YELLING, SCREAMING,& totally worse. Dire Straits are better because Mark Knopflerhas a much better voice than any other band. This album is justas bad as Appetite for Destruction, & Use Your Illusion I. Don'tbuy this album, buy Dire Straits albums insted."
5,Pump by Aerosmith,"I recently borrowed this CD from the local library, it is one of my favorites from 80s ad 90s rock, unfortunately this copy from the library was damaged and it was the only one. I immediately got on Amazon and I was so happy to find the CD at such an excellent price. I have been playing it almost constantly since I bought it. Thank you."
4,Not Bad,"This album contians some classics such as ""Love In An Elevator"", ""What It Takes"", and the underrated ""F.I.N.E"". No Aerosmith fan should be without it.The Guns N Roses fan must not have listened to this closley. No Solos? Has he ever heard Love In An Elevator?"
4,one of their best,"buy the album if you enjoy good music and someone teach that moron that loves Guns N Roses how to spell the word instead...oh, I guess I just taught him...anyway, buying this album is a no brainer....just get it...thank you"
3,If you enjoyed Permanent Vacation....,"you'll sure enjoy Pump too! I was hesitant about getting this album as I thought that Permanent Vacation was so good for a ""comeback"" album that the band were bound to lose their lustre. However, I was wrong and Pump is every bit as enjoyable as Permanent Vacation. Great lively rock with some tracks you'll remember from the radio back in the late 80s / early 90s (Jamie's Got a Gun, Love in an Elevator). And it's not just these tracks that stand out, overall the album's quality is consistently good in and of itself."
5,Wonderful Books!,"My 7 year old received the Samantha Book Set this Christmas 2011 and I have been reading them to her every night before bed! We are hooked! My daughter is asking questions and learning so much about empathy, kindness, friendship and history! Wow! I never knew that the American Girl books were this good! We are enjoying them so much! We rented Felicity: An American Girl Adventure DVD and she also learned so much! She loves the American Girl series and now we can't wait to continue into other series! I totally recommend bonding with your child while reading these books!"
4,A pretty neat book,"Samantha is a Victorian girl. She is an orphan who's Grandmother takes her in. Eventually, she moves to New York, where her Aunt and Uncle adopt her. While she is with her Grandmother, she makes new friends, plays tricks on the spoiled neighbor, and goes on lots of exciting adventures. I read the first book in her series last year. I completely fell in love with character! I decided to save my money and buy the Samantha doll from pleasant company. Over all, The Samantha books were great, and I reccomend them to readers ages 8 to 12."
4,HAPPY ENDING FOR ALL!,"The most charming book so far in the American Girls series. Samantha's life in turn-of-the-last-century New York presents in my view the series' most well-rounded picture into society at that time, with its incorporation of orphans and the working class in among its economically-privileged main characters. The writing here was the best of any American Girl novel and the dialogue seemed knitted to its era and not anachronistically modernized in the slightest. Yes, I know the improbable ending is the fabric of fairy tales but it still makes for a happy conclusion to a nice visit back a hundred years ago in time."
2,Disappointed,Recently my husband and I heard some Perry Como music on the radio. We enjoyed it and thought we would like to have a collection of his songs. We ordered this three disc set which we thought would be good. It is a collection of mostly songs we have never heard and are certainly not Perry Como's best. Each disc was worse than the one before. It is not the Perry Como we remember.
2,Not Recommended,"Like many of P.B. Ellis' books, this volume is not as accurate as it seems. The linguistic information, in particular, is unreliable. For a few more dollars, you can have the much more reliable and more comprehensive _Dictionary of Celtic Mythology_ edited by James Mac Killop. It's worth the extra investment, no matter how strict your budget."
3,Emergence by Barbara Marx Hubbard,"This book started out with profound information that quickly caught and held my attention. However, I lost interest a few chapters in when the author focused on her own journaling journey. I think the book would be very helpful for those people who are seeking guidance early in their own self-discovery work. I'm further along in my personal growth and am seeking more. I may go back to the book to ""spot"" read, as this book is required reading for an upcoming advanced ministerial work class that I'm taking."
3,sammy kershaw,"this product was in fair condition, the case was cracked. It was received in a timely manner"
4,Good traditional country sound,"What some people may be interested in, about this 1993 album, is that one of the background singers is Shania Twain. Of course, an unknown at that time. Anyway, this is truly a good traditional style country album. Sammy has a good country voice, and every song here is a good song. The title song is especially touching."
4,"NOT AS GOOD AS HIS FIRST, BUT BETTER THAN THE REST TO COME!","Sammy is still pretty traditional here; although he seems to be getting into more of the ""pop"" arena. Still, it is much better than his more recent albums."
3,Grabs gracefully,"3 1/2Some repetitious textures, particularly on Hamre's part, cannot inherently diminish the expansive minimalism's intoxicating allure."
5,Feel The Love Generation!,"'Love Generation' is amazing. Every time I listen to this song and close my eyes, I think of summer, sun, fun,... all the bad thoughts just blow away. This is better than antidepressants!"
5,One of the most touching books I've ever read,"I first read this book when I was in high school and I've never forgotten it. It's a realistic and sympathetic portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln, a woman who suffered greatly through no real fault of her own."
5,Love is Eternal,i have known of this work for many years...it is excellent in every regard from historical content to presentation of personal vulnerability and the overuling of Divine providence. It was purchased as a gift and the recipient has assured me that she has enjoyed it extremely.
3,Not yet Read,I have not read the book in its entirety just yet I have read the first 5 sections in the book and I have found them somewhat tedious. The book is filled with diverse topics which only a few have been able to stimulate my interests.
2,"Pretty reading, but be cautious","When I first bought this book, I enjoyed the stories within them. I felt that they offered great food for thought for spiritual contemplation. Unfortunately, I also found them lacking in truly deep thought -- they were more of a superficial approach to important issues.Recently, I have been informed by individuals within the Native American community that the work of Jamie Sams is offensive to Native Americans. Her work is presented in a manner disrespectful to her very source of information and/or inspiration for her writings.Although I do feel that this book has value, I believe that value is minimal. I suggest looking elsewhere.If you want a good read about a Native American woman, I highly recommend ""Lakota Woman"" by Mary Brave Bird/Mary Crow Dog. It is an autobiography that presents a Native American's views about her life, including Native practices and beliefs, and is VERY eye opening and insightful!"
5,Excellent,"This book covers each and every of the 13 clan mothers purpose and wisdom that they each individually bring, a great reference and a nice read about each of the wise women"
4,Very interesting book,I enjoyed reading and learning from this book and also have the cards and I enjoy them as well. Very good author....read and enjoy and best of all--learn.
3,They've Done Better,"This Cd is good, but it doesn't capture the bands energy and shear power the way Let it Burn or Sun Creature did. The biggest problem is for a 3 piece band they get way too into over dubbing their songs on this one. When you see Eddie Glass played 4 different instruments on a track you have to ask yourself how many arms does this guy have? Then you hear the fact that it is simply lots of overdubbing (something I am not a fan of) All in all it's a pretty good rock record, the kind you don't hear too much because eMpTyVee and radio are too busy with ""new metal"" and that whole rap/rock fusion, it's just not as good as previous work."
2,didn't mudhoney do this 12 years ago?,"to the center is not a bad cd, and i like the band enough but does anyone who owns superfuzz bigmuff, vincebus eruptum, outsideinside, and funhouse really NEED this? it sounds cool enough but doesn't have anything that you haven't heard before. remember ""stonerrock"" is pretty much grunge w/ an echoplex. not that that's a bad thing at all, it's just not the musical revolution some people would like you to think it is."
1,A rip-off...,"Nothing more than an advertisement for his expensive mail-order non-counter strategies. The strategy he claims to present in this book is misrepresented as a non-counting strategy, when in fact it is (he basically says estimate the number of high cards remaining by watching which cards have been played, which is the definition of counting). If you want the actual non-counter strategy, you have to shell out $50 for a mail-order packet. Stay away."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars.,"Save your money. Page after page of advertisement for the Cardoza School. If you want to purchase ads, buy this book. The author stops short of giving useful information to hawk his own courses. I quote from page 90:""Those readers desiring to further their edge over the house in blackjack...must learn either a counting system or the advanced non-counter strategy. See the back of the book for information...""Buy the book to learn to buy the course. That's all you will learn. This book does not offer any unique information."
3,Old friends with Elton John,"I found this album when looking for Elton John's Friends, which I loved in high school. This double CD set has all the Friends tracks, plus other lesser-known songs. I enjoyed most of the tracks, but since they were not bit hits when they came out, I am not familiar with them, and I find that I listen only to the Friends tracks. If you like listening to unusual, 'B-side' tracks, this is a great album, but if like me you are looking for Friends, consider purchasing just the Friends album if you can find it."
5,A must-have for any fan,"As it states in the 24 page booklet, ""These Are the Songs that Got Away"". These are the songs that never appeared on an Elton studio album. The singles, B-Sides, alternate versions, the ""Friends"" soundtrack, and a previously unreleased song. The book is very informative with track-by-track notes and loads of photos. The double cd jewel case package comes in a cardboard slipcase. This double set really is a must-have for any true-blue fan of Elton and Bernie. Some of the songs have since been included on the Elton Remasters of his Classic Years as bonus tracks, but there is still plenty that you can't get anywhere else. Recommended."
5,This is Elton and Bernie at their non-pop-radio best!,Simply put. Buy this set. Elton John fans will truly enjoy this one. Tell a friend.
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...it's hard to determine a rating on this box set because although it shows that Elton had great non-album tracks, the best stuff in this box has been added as bonus tracks to his albums. So you probably want to skip this in favor of buying the expanded editions of his early 70's albums."
4,An Entertaining Album,"You will like this album. I have been a big Elton fan since 1970, and, though it sounds strange, this album has an outtake from the Tumbleweed Connection (my favorite album of all time)album that is now one of my top five EJ cuts: it is ""Into The Old Man's Shoes"". Other than time considerations, how could this possibly not have made it onto the original? You will recognize the old-West style immediately.This album also encompasses the Friends soundtrack, which I also consider a tremendous piece of work (I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one). Unfortunately, they shorted one track from the original LP, but it does have my single favorite Elton cut ever, ""Michelle's Song"". This is a beautiful song that never saw the light on day as far as radio airplay went. It's made all the better if you've seen the movie (which I also loved -- see ""minority"" remark above)."
5,Reggae/Pop at it's best.,This is there best CD ever. Reggae Party is the absolute summerhit of '99.Nothing but hits. Can't wait to see them on tour.
2,"Love Queen L, but...","I didn't really care too much for this movie. It had it's funny moments, but I just didn't like some of the scenes. Especially, when that woman was singing an old negro spiritual. That was un called for in my opinion. I think that could have been left out. Steve Martin's lawyer friend was funny trying to talk ""black"", but then it got to be annoying too. I think Queen L should stick to more rolls like Chicago and Barbershop 2. Don't do any more movies like this. Not good."
1,Can I put less than 1 star?,"If it's possible, I think my IQ dropped 10 points after seeing this poor excuse for a movie. I see that there are positive reviews for it, which is only a painful reminder of the slipping intelligence of our population, or just a cruel cruel joke to swindle you in to wasting your money and time on this disaster.Though the film makes juvenile attempts to provoke laughter, if you are more intelligent than a 2 by 4, you will be in utter disbelief of its stupidity. I have honestly had better times throwing up from food-poisoning."
5,very satisfied,The DVD arrived in rapid time and was in great shape. We watched it and it is just what we hoped for.
3,No Surprises.,"I was looking forward to watching BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE. I cracked up when I first saw the trailer back in December. I thought that any movie that has Steve Martin hip-hopping, has to be hilarious. Unfortunately, almost all the funny scenes were shown in the trailers so there really isn't anything that is unexpected. Not only that but the last fifteen minutes of the film turn into a semi-serious drama which makes the scene of Steve Martin doing hip-hop less funny than it really is. However, the movie does have a few things going for it, mainly Eugene Levy--he steals most of the scenes that he is in and since he wasn't shown very much in the trailers, some of his schtick is totally unexpected. Also, the movie does have Steve Martin and though he does seem to be playing the same character he's played in the last ten films he's done; there are a few comic surprises that he is allowed to unleash. Overall, just an average movie worth waiting until the video comes out."
3,"Funny, but not much of a step forward from ""BAPs.""","Queen Latifah's very funny as Charlene, the sure-of-herself convict who romances a straight-laced lawyer named Peter over the Internet in an attempt to get him to work on her case. When she arrives on his doorstep, he's expecting a trim, blonde and white female lawyer ... but what he gets is an all-up-in-here girlfriend with a serious need to get her hair done.Invading his life, Peter, played by Steve Martin, loosens up. And his friend, played by Eugene Levy, falls in love with Latifah's ""cocoa goddess,"" but those jokes go from funny to predictable a bit quickly.Some reviewers said Latifah portrayed a sort of magic black person, like Will Smith in ""Bagger Vance,"" who teaches the white people how to live. They've also said the movie concentrates too much on stereotypes.Those claims aren't entirely untrue, but the movie is not very serious and very funny, from time to time."
2,How can people miss how offensive this movie is?,"Love Steve Martin so I thought this would be worth seeing. Horrible stereotypes of white people, horrible stereotypes of black people. The white people generally seem to be suburban racists. The black people generally seem to be inner-city thugs. There is one scene in the movie that kind of says it all-- Steve Martin doesn't want his neighbors to see him bring a black person into the house (!?) -- so he sneaks her in behind an inflatable raft! Everyone involved in the production should be ashamed."
1,I Want My Money Back!!!,"This movie was dreadful! Most if not all of the ""jokes"" were racist and offednding. I was totally shocked and amased that this movie carried only a PG-13 rating. This ""comedy"" shoud have been rated R. I mean it! I just about turned the darn thing off, then I just thought that 'okay, this is suposevly Laugh Out Loud funny, so I'll just watch it and see..."" I was completely wrong. I have seen better acting in a 'Chucky' movie than this. I love Queen Lateafa, I thin she's great. I love Betty White, I think she is one of the best 'golden girls' out there. She is normally so funny. This movie left me so dry, except for a chuckle here and there. So, this movie is oneof the worst movies ever made, and a waste of talent. This was awful! NOT FOR KIDS AT ALL!"
1,"boring, unfunny movie; bad transfer to dvd",I didn't see this film in the theater. I'm very happy about that because this film is very unfunny for a comedy. The plot is beyond cliched. I didn't laugh once in the first half hour so I went to the last scene and -- surprise -- the film ended as I would have predicted.I mention that I didn't see this in a theater because I don't know whether the film's credits intentionally look bad (and looked that way in the theater) or whether the transfer to dvd was at fault. The words looked quite blurred at times; some names looked worse than others. Even the rest of the film (what I was willing to watch of it) seemed to suffer from a slightly jagged look.Highly UNrecommended.
2,campy but feelgood little movie,"OK, it's totally contrived and campy, but if you like Steve Martin and Queen Latifah you'll probably agree that it deserves two and maybe even 3 stars. If you are not a fan, probably not worth your time and money."
4,hilarious fun!,"Very Funny! Lots of Action! Queen Latifah at her best! Unforgettable scene where Steve Martin transforms himself into a ""homeboy"""
5,hillarious,"Steve Martin & Queen Latifah, A Perfect Match. you wouldn't think that these 2 would make a team but they do. this movie is really good and really funny. it's a must see."
2,Something To See,"This movie isn't as hilarious as it was made out to be, by far. But it does have its funny moments. In fact - a couple of scenes live up to the hype. But as for the entire film, it seems to be lacking something. Latifah is the best part of the movie, of course, but even she can't bring it up to what it was promised to be. Don't get me wrong - the movie is good - just not as good as we were lead to believe. I will say that Eugene Levy adds a nice touch to the movie, and his lines are memerable. For whatever reason - Latifah's fashion seems to stand out more than the movie itself. She sports some rather stunning outfits in the film. You will have some degree of fun with this one, though - even if it isn't the level of fun the critics promised."
3,Average film,"This was supposed to be a funny movie, and at times it is. The constant racist jokes though, are not funny. Maybe to some but I didn't find them funny at all. The movie stars Steve Martin, Eugene Levy and Queen Latifah. Queen Latifah plays an ex-con who didn't commit the crime who meets Steve Martin's character on the internet, and they meet up. She becomes the new nanny for his children. The plot is nothing new, it's more a popcorn movie than anything. There's a few laughs here and there, and it's no fault to the cast, but I didn't get all the hype around this movie."
2,disappointing,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, as I love Queen Latifah and Steve Martin. Sad to say, this film was really bad. Latifah had a few shining moments (she simply radiates charisma), as did Eugene Levy, but most of the film was sullied by blatant racism. I was actually rather shocked at the racist ""jokes,"" which were anything but funny."
2,It had potential...,"Maybe 3 if you're feeling generous. It was way too nice and formulaic. Eugene Levy is funny as a goofy white guy who lusts after Queen Latifah. Latifah is good. Steve Martin is especially funny in the scene where he dresses like a gangsta rapper and goes to a club in Compton and talks like Snoop. However, If you've ever seen any ""fish out of water"" comedies, you will realize that the writers just worked the premise to death and really came up pretty short."
5,OMG...hilarious!!,"I cannot say enough about this film...I saw it when it first came out to the theaters and I had to see it again when it came out on DVD...this is one of the funniest movies of 2003!! Almost every bit, if not every bit of this movie had me laughing to the point of p*****g my pants...for real!! QL and Steve Martin are excellent in this film, and if you just want to have a good time, and can relax a bit...rent this film!! It is so good, I might buy it!!"
2,Striving to be Funny,"Big stars, hip lines, action, romance, should add up to hit. This is not.Disappointed."
3,Not My House,BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE is just not that funny. It is somewhat amusing but overall I found it rather flat and a little annoying. This is really not one of Steve Martin's better efforts. Queen Latifah is more annoying than funny. The storyline is just not credible and elements are just too over-the-top. Queen Latifah's fight scene in the locker room was meant to be funny but it looked more like a fight scene out of GAME OF DEATH and was too violent. My heart went out to Steve Martin because you could tell he was trying to make the best of a poor script.
1,I can't believe all the 5 star reviews for this nonsense.,"If this is what people find amusing, then I must be some sort of reptile.This movie is UNBELIEVABLY horrible. I didn't laugh once during the entire debacle. Promoting racist stereotypes, while attempting to make light of them while boring the audience to death with such a weak plot seems to be the MO of Hollywood nowadays.What happened to comedy?"
3,some entertaining scenes,"Queen Latifah as the convict is convinced that the conservative attorney Steve Martin can help her. to that end, she turns his life upside down.despite a rough start the two bond. Overall a nice average comedy. The race card is played a little too much and beginning a little slow. But there are two hilarious scenes that make this comedy worth the price of a movie ticket or rental."
4,Funny stuff from a funny movie,"What a great rental this was! Steve Martin is definitely worth checking out in this hilarious movie about the collision of two worlds. Prior to this movie, I had yet to see the Queen in anything, but I can't wait for more from her.This movie was so funny we were laughing out loud in a couple of scenes (like watching Steve Martin dance Hip-Hop and speak the lingo).The extras were really nothing special and they wouldn't push me over the top to purchase the DVD so I recommend going the rental route first.About the only disappointment in the whole show was the stupid neighbor that kept making derogatory remarks. I wouldn't go over the top and call it racist, just unnecessary in the grand scheme of the movie."
2,okay...,"This movie isn't the best movie I've ever watched, nor is it even close to being the worst. It had a few good laughs, but could have been a lot better."
3,ok movie if you need something to do,"A WORKAHOLIC ATTORNEY [STEVE MARTIN] MEETS A FEMALE LAWYER ON THE INTERNET. BUT WHEN HE FINALLY MEETS HIS POTENTIAL SOULMATE, HE INSTEAD GETS A PRISON ESCAPEE [QUEEN LATIFAH] WHO NEEDS HER NAME CLEARED. AN OK FILM IF YOU NEED SOMETHING TO DO. THE FUNNIEST SCENES TAKE PLACE AT AN URBAN CLUB."
5,Bringing Down The House (Full Screen Edition),"Peter Sanderson is a divorced, straight-laced, uptight attorney who still loves his ex-wife and can't figure out what he did wrong to make her leave him. However, Peter's trying to move on, and he's smitten with a brainy, bombshell barrister he's been chatting with online. However, when she comes to his house for their first face-to-face, she isn't refined, isn't Ivy League, and isn't even a lawyer. Instead, it's Charlene, a prison escapee who's proclaiming her innocence and wants Peter to help her clear her name. But Peter wants nothing to do with her, prompting the loud and shocking Charlene to turn Peter's perfectly ordered life upside down, jeopardizing his effort to get back with his wife and woo a billion dollar client. Bringing Down the House is a very funny movie and you will have a good time seeing it, an absolute hoot, with the cast stealing the show with marvellous chemistry, and giving three of best comedic turns you're likely to see."
3,not recommend for childrens,"to many grown up actions in the movie and also too many colorful words but good for grown upd very funny all the way through the movie.gave 3 stars because of the colorful words that children could not here and some of the action that was and performed,we do not want to give children any ideals nor do we want to incourge them."
2,"Entertaining, but not more...","Steve Martin plays Peter Sanderson, an uptight lawyer, who has recently met his dream woman online who known to him as Lawyer Girl. Peter has arranged a meeting with this Lawyer Girl who is a fit, blond Ivy League graduate with the same occupation as him as he has recently divorced and need to fill the void. However, when Lawyer Girl rings on his door he is startled as it is an African-American woman that has recently escaped from prison. She insists that she has been wrongly punished as she is innocent, but Peter attempts to avoid the whole ordeal as he faces his own prejudice. Bring Down the House is an honest attempt in making a comedy about bigotry and racism in our present society, but fails in delivering the punch line. There are some very entertaining scenes, but it does not save the cinematic experience as it seems to tumble down hill as the story unfolds."
2,Bringing Down The House,Bringing Down The House. The movie paused itself several times. Could have seen it without any interruptions. Didn't meet my expectations.
2,Bringing Down The House,"There is something on this DVD, I have not taken time to use a cleaner yet but the movie just stops. After awhile it will go again. This happens several times. Not plased with my purchase."
2,Blaxplotation at its finest.,The use of corny stereotypes and slang made as an african american man want to vommit.
2,Oh dear god... what was I thinking?,"What was I thinking when I got this movie? It's not funny. Not funny at all. The acting is decent, or at least the acting in the first 25 minutes. That's about as long as I ended up watching the movie before losing interest. Oh my was this horrible. Why couldn't this DVD magically transform into a great Steve Martin movie like ""The Man with Two Brains""? Queen Latifah, is not funny. Steve Martin is not funny. This movie is not funny. I sure hope somebody liked this movie. After watching 25 minutes of this movie, I wanted to poke out my eyes with a hot poker and stick wet paper towels in my ears."
3,Bringing Down the house,This DVD is funny. There were some places that was laugh out loud for me. If you are looking for something silly this might be one for you.
4,A RETURN TO FORM FOR STEVE MARTIN,"Steve Martin acts like the Steve Martin we grew up with on SNL, and that is the best thing about ""Bringing Down The House."" He turns into the ""Wild and Crazy Guy"" as he dances with Queen Latifah, becomes the overboard non-hip white guy as he apes hip hop, and plays the WASP-y uptight lawyer to perfection.Eugene Levy gets all the best lines, stealing about every scene he's in. Q.L. proves her Oscar nom in ""Chicago"" was not a fluke. Her presnce and chemistry help save a by-the-numbers movie and give Martin a perfect foil. ""Bringing Down The House"" won't bring down any Academy nods, but it is a better than average family movie, along the lines of Jim Carrey's ""Liar Liar."""
3,Could of been better,Seeing the previews for this movie it looked hilorious! but after watching the movie it could of been funnier.Yes there were the good parts that you would laugh out loud at but it got kind boring and seemed like it just dragged on.you best bet would be to rent it.
3,Ok with some flaws.,"Martin and Latifa's chemistry was good and the movie did have it's funny part. The bad part was that practically every supporting character was a racist, from the neighbor, to the sister the the heiress. As a white person I didnt find these character's funny. Also one racist is enought, but three?"
2,One to Forget,"I have seen several Steve Martin movies and this is by far the worst. Martin begin a dialogue with a lady on the Internet. When he finally wants to meet her, he makes a date at his house with his ""blonde"" blind date. Instead Queen Latifah shows up.It turns out that Latifah is a fugitive on the run and she wants Martin to help her. Too many corny scenes follow, especially the annoying antics of Latifah. Eugene Levy is not at all funny as Martin's friend who craves Latifah. Definately not anywhere near his American Pie and National Lampoon's Vacation roles.Not even worth renting!"
3,Worth watching - pretty good comedy - C+,"I was hesitant to rent this movie because of a lot of bad reviews it received - (not all bad though). I was finally talked into renting the DVD. Boy, was I surprised. It actually was funny and I laughed a lot during this movie and that just doesn't happen very often any more with so-called ""comedies"". So, I enjoyed watching this comedy but it's not for everyone. There may be some people that can't handle the graphic humor that contains a lot of racial and ethnic stereotypes. Queen Latifah, Steve Martin and Eugene Levy all did a great job and I don't think this movie would have been funny without them. I've been a huge Steve Martin fan since I was a teenager but I'm starting to become a Queen Latifah fan too. She's funny and multi-talented. This movie isn't perfect or flawless but it's a pretty good comedy with a great cast and I recommend it only to open-minded people that aren't easily offended. I rate it C+"
3,"Starts funny, ends dissapointing","Steve Martin is a conservative white divorcee tax attorney who has struck up an e-mail friendship with a woman he thinks is a glamorous blonde lawyer, but who turns out to be a black ex-convict, Queen Latifya(I'd never even heard of her until I saw this movie, but she is very funny). She tries to persuade him to help her prove her innocence, but he doesn't want to have anything to do with her, so she devises a series of schemes to change his mind. The first half of the film is very funny, but the second half flags a bit, though it is enlivened by Joan Plowright as a preposterously bigoted uptight wealthy old cow. I thought Steve Martin and Queen Latifya were going to get it together, but no he prefers to go back to his insipid blonde ex-wife, which I found a huge dissapointment. The film would have been much more fun if he had ended up with the Queen."
3,Funny Funny Funny,"Come on film snobs, this film was hilarious...Queen Latifah fighting the skinny girl to the song ""Simply irresistable""..then the old lady singing ""is massa gonna sell us at the market?"" while Queen looked like she was gonna go berserk on the old lady...then the old woman getting stoned and dancing on the bar at the end...funny funny funny stuff, I loved it.."
3,Fine but way too simple Comedy,"Bring down The House is a funny movie but rings the joke over and over again, and it becomes offensive after a while. Yes, Steve Martin is Funny as always, and Queen Latifa does hold her own with him but most of the jokes do come far and between, and they are repeated more than needed. Maybe if they had a real plot to go by, it would have been funnier but unfortunately its not."
2,Strictly for the Fans,"Steve Martin can do good comedy well; Queen Latifah, I never heard of. This script had worn out its welcome more than a dozen years before Wheeler and Woolsey made a hit in Rio Rita. I found it painful to watch Steve Martin desperately trying to pump life into his part; Latifah's role, I assumed, was constructed on the foundation of trade mark characteristics. Whatever, the result left much to be desired. If you are a fan of either or of both, you may enjoy this (essentially) TV skit expanded.At any rate, were I you, I would ignore my star rating and review. I would whole-heartedly agree that I am just not tuned in to this wavelength."
4,Feisty and Funny -,"""Bringing Down the House"" is funny and light hearted story of a lonely, divorced lawyer Peter (Steve Martin) who meets a feisty prison inmate on an Internet dating site. The prison inmate escapee, Charlene (Queen Latifah), is determined to convince him she is innocent of a crime and needs his help. He fights her tooth and nail as she upsets his controlling ways. Charlene starts positive changes in Peter's life, his children's life as well as his ex-wife's opinion of him.The movie will make you laugh with hilarious situations and good script. I also enjoyed the co-stars Eugene Levy and Joan Plowright."
4,Funny,This is about a lawyer played by Steve Martin who is divorced and ordered a girlfriend of an ad. He is rich and lives in a good neighbourhood. He didnt know that an ex convict (played by Queen Latifah) would turn up at the house and it goes on.Some funny parts are Steve Martin going into a black club dressed as a gangsta and the posh old white woman in the black club getting drunk and stoned.Overall it is a funny movie
3,Madcap mystery,"I adore Phoebe Atwood Taylor's mysteries. Although this isn't my very favourite, the breathless rush of events is typical of her style, the characters are engaging and it's a window into WWII America."
5,A must for anyone wishing to understand the Greek Church,"A thorough, understandable and entertaining history of the Greek Orthodox Church from the fall of Byzantium to the eve of Greek independence. Sir Steven Runciman, the world's foremost Byzantine authority, excels in his down to earth scholarly style. A must for Byzantine scholars, history buffs, and for those wishing to understand the Orthodox Church."
1,"Definitely NOT in ""very good"" condition","If scribbled ink bindings and torn covers are considered ""very good"" then maybe, but not by my standards. I was extremely disappointed. I supposed it's a good thing that I didn't purchase one that was just in ""good"" condition! Do not buy from this seller. This was clearly misleading and we spent way too much for this product."
3,doesn't stay on well,"These bandages seem to be the best around, but the adhesive doesn't stay on and they rub off after a few hours. Expensive for just a few hours."
5,All I Can say is WOW!,"This program has shaken me out of the doldrums of feeling stuck in my present work situation and has opened my mind to some exciting new ideas. While I enjoy the work I do, I have found myself feeling restricted by the corporate environmental mindset. With this program I am able to look at my work with new eyes...inspired by a new vision. While it's my intention to leave my present job to free lance...I have been able to tune into a more abundant mindset where I am. I am able to see results in my world already. I believe I was really ready for this program...the timing was perfect. To be able to create abundance at a time when everyone is fearful for the economy and it's gyrations is impressive indeed. Thanks Mr. Jarrow for your passionate pursuit of the UnCareer! I believe that this is the present trend for many...to pursue a path of meaningful rewarding work and workplace.Pass this along to anyone you know who is experiencing burn out, mid life crisis, etc."
2,Doesn't seem the same,"This product ""used to be Multi-Fiber"" but is now called ""Cleansing Blend with Fibers"". I'm not sure, but it just doesn't seem the same as Multi-fiber. Buy only one bottle to see if it works for you before buying more."
2,Not like the former Multi Fiber,"I have taken Multi Fiber for years with no side effects. However, these new ""replacement"" supplements are more extreme, and cause unpleasant side effects, and G.I. upset. I do not recommend."
2,Over rated,"I have tried different fiber mix and this one is below what i expected. You would be better with Metamulic than Nature Secret. It only soften up your stool. Once i stopped using it, it take a few day before my system goes back to normal. I think different people have different result with this fiber mix. I have better result with metamucil with lesser problem."
4,Stripped Russia,"Following the world examples of comedy self-whipping (Shameless,Little Britainetc), TV-set producers sarcastically embed very homophobic, sexist, xenophobic issues from a notion of contemporary daily affairs Russians experience routinely.Sometimes dirty, sometimes too explicitly-rude but always funny for demonstrating home stupidity nakedly, stripped of political correctness sharply, it is a good serial to improve Russian and to get hands-on lesson of grass-root opinion Russian style."
5,"Grab Your ""Blues Preacher"" Pedal.....","...and have some fun. This may be the finest example of British Blues guitar work ever done. There is not a weak element anywhere on this disc. The vocal, bass and drum work is all solid, but this is about Robin Trower on the guitar. Everybody talks about ""Zep II"", but I like this better. It's just too bad that Robin Trower never found this kind of magic on any of his other solo releases."
3,Abe and Liz,The album was shipped in good packaging and was one of the first to reach us in Australia via international shipment from the US. The 1974 sound reminds one of Hendrix ever so often and is soulful - blues rock - good so far. The album as such is 2nd solo one for Trower after his Procul Harum days. But the quality was not as clear as one would have. There was a 'veil' effect through out the album. Wonder if this has to do with the original studio sound engineering in the mid 70s?
5,GREAT,WARM summer day a bottle of Lambrusco and some well you know. Memories of days long ago. GREAT CD.
5,Trower's Best,"This has always been my favorite Robin Trower album. All the rest of his songs I like would probably fit on a 60 minute disc but that's not bad. All the songs on here are good/great. And some cross the border into ""great"". ""In this Place"" and ""About to Begin"" are two of my personal favorites. ""Day of the Eagle"" almost sounds like Hendrix at the conclusion and ""Bridge of Sighs"" is a sound to behold even though it does get a bit repetitive at times. If you're turning on to some of the old rock 'n roll look for this. I was 18 when it came out. Imagine that."
5,Bridge of Wonder,"If you don't onw this album--buy it now!! There is more here than just blistering (masterful) bluesrock guitar. There is exceptional songwriting--this is not the kind of guitar album that leaves you saying,""yea, yea, just get to the solo!"" These are songs you savor from beginning to end! James Dewar's smokey, soulful vocals were evey bit as important as Robins guitar playing. In fact, I can't think of another singer who could have pulled off these songs as convincingly and with as much authority as Dewar. I only wish I could hear this album again with virgin ears!"
4,HIGHLY COMPLEX BLUES-ROCK,"Trower, Reg Isidore and James are in top notch form here, delivering some of the best rock music ever recorded in the nineties. The extra-tracks here are nosense. I prefer they be inedit tracks, something like this, than live version of the same original songs of the CD. Other than this, this album is pertect."
4,high rich guitar playing,I really like this Cd the guitar playing is great.I do have to add. Some times he plays the same over and over to much.But in all it's a great playing sounding CD.It has that great sounding guitar like Jimmy Hendrix. The sounds of the 70'sA very powerful sound.I give 4 stars.
5,Great CD,Grew up with this one and never here it anymore so i bought it at a great price and am very glad i did. Get you one.
5,The best kept secret in classic rock history,"Every song on this album is absolutely outstanding, being one of fewer than ten albums that I could name where every single song is excellent. My personal favorites are Bridge of Sighs, Day of the Eagle, Too Rolling Stoned and Little Bit of Sympathy. Yet somehow this album seems to be overlooked by rock fans and rock radio stations.This version also includes five live tracks, featuring the best songs from the album. These are also excellent.The sound quality on this CD is much improved over older versions.If you are contemplating between this disc and the import that combines Twice Removed From Yesterday/Bridge of Sighs, I would recommend this one instead for the improved sound quality and the live tracks."
5,GREAT CLASSIC ROCK ALBUM,GOT TO SEE HIM TWICE IN AUSTIN IN 2008 & 2009.WE CAUGHT HIM OUTSIDE & GOT PHOTO & TICKET STUB SIGNED.GOT THE TICKET STUB INSIDE THIS CD CASE.THIS IS MUST HAVE FOR 70S ROCK.THE EXTENDED LIVE SHORT SET IS SWEET ALSO.
5,Suicide,"As for Robin Trower's lasting power, he still tours and sells out most venues he plays. He is consigned now to the smaller clubs and I recommend you catch him. As I understand, Bridge of Sighs is about a bridge, (in France?), where people who have succumbed to life's miseries and hardships, throw themselves off to end it all. Never have I heard a more mournful song that describes this ending as Bridge of Sighs. It is a classic that endures when all other music is forgotten."
2,Could have been better,"I agree with the other reveiwers that they should have shown Gacy as ""Pogo The Clown"" more. This movie was creepy knowning that this guy truly existed, but they should have gone more into his back story and possibly why he was so messed up. Obvious he had big issues about his feelings towards men, but things are much deeper then that.He kills about three or four people in this movie, but you never see him in the act. That would made it even better for the fans who want to watch the movie for gore and horror. If you are looking for that stay away. Not much blood in this film.Mark Hutton did a great job as Gacy, but the script kept him down from possibly making a big impact."
1,"Gacy is a rollercoaster ride into..wait, this movie sucks","Yes, this would be a good movie if it wasnt directed by the writer and yes, Mark Holton is a bad choice for the lead role. Holton doesnt have a very good movie record (Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Leprechaun come into mind). This movie is a boring mess. Adam Baldwin (Tv's Firefly, Tv's Angel) is totally wasted as Gacy's father. Script sucks beyond belief and the acting is a flippin' pile. Though, Charlie Weber (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), who played the kid who was living with Gacy, did try the best he could but it was washed off by other supportees. The second by second shots of clown faces doesnt help it at all. This was dead in the water when it hit the screen."
2,Close to the Facts,"This movie follows the true story of John Wayne Gacy closely, but if you are as critical as I am you will notice many inconsistencies. Overall it would seem to be dull for those who do not find the lives of Serial Killer's fascinating."
3,alright,this movie was alright. even though it didnt really have alot of information in it. barely scratching the pogo the clown point. as in most cases. better to reasearch online or read books then to watch the movies.
4,A true enigma.,"Like all true psychopaths, this film highlights how well they can blend into society as a 'normal' memebr of the community. The horror of their crimes necessitates the need to be accepted by their peers and not to ever make themselves noticeable and therefore questioned. Serial killers are never the ones that are unkempt and lascivious. They are always the well accepted good citizens."
2,THIS IS NOT GACY,"THIS MOVIE WAS AN EXTREME DISSAPOINTMENT. AS A MAN HAVING SOME INTEREST IN THE MIND AND ACTIONS OF A SERIAL KILLER THIS TALE WAS LAME AT BEST. WAS GACY REALLY THIS BIG OF A SISSY? THIS MOVIE TOTALLY MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A FOOL. THERE WAS NO DETAIL TO THIS MOVIE AT ALL. IT SHOOTS A SCENE, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEONE IS DEAD. IT NEVER SHOWS HOW THE PEOPLE DIE. IT ALSO DOES NOT GO MORE INTO HIS CHILDHOOD. SOME PRISON LIFE WOULD BE NICE TOO. TO ME IT LOOKED LIKE A DOCUMENTRY ON BUGS AND WORMS. THEY MUST HAVE SHOWED THEM 100 TIMES. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL. I SUGGEST YOU STICK TO MADE UP SERIAL KILLERS SUCH AS HANNIBLE LECTER."
2,Gacy-save your money,"No real gore, which is ok but there was so little shown or reasons given as to why he did things or how often or what he did to his victims. I can guess after raping some boys he felt he had to protect himself and kill them but why only a relative few. No real thought or scene was followed through, it just went black and when to another thought. The research for this film must have be a glancing review of one newspaper article. Video was a real disappointment. I learned he was fat, likely rich but got killed for not paying someone a minor debt. Their weeks wages? He had 2000 male contacts and they found 29 in his cellar, and I believe there were 4 floaters in a water way in his area so he likely did them. So only 33 of the 2000 were killed, WHY???"
3,It was O.K.,"Problems: It left out a lot of the story, which most of these serial killer movies seem to do. It fast forwards through his childhood. other left out facts: does not mention that specialists believe Gacy's abnormal behavior was from blood clot in the brain cause by a childhood swing accident. It also doesn't mention him trying to build a pool, that is where the bodies where stored. Doesn't mention him attacking men at job interviews, and at least 3 court actions brought against him before he was caught. Finally, it doesn't mention his time spent on death row: He would paint clowns, and portraits of Jeffrey Dahmer from what I understand. Other than all these facts left out, I thought this movie could have been more twisted if they had added more blood, or actually showed more of the torture he did. Don't get me wrong, there was torture scenes, but there was a lot of ""you fill in the blanks"" too. The Ted Bundy movie was better"
1,"If you can't say something nice, say nothing at all..","Mark Holton who you may remember as the bike thief Francis in ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" plays the title character of the famous serial killer John Wayne Gacy. While he has the look and the flamboyance, he simply doesn't cut the mustard as an actor with the skills to play Gacy. His performance isn't at the top of the list indicating the worse things about this movie. Let's continue with the script issues. I'm wondering if they even had one. The pace of the film is sluggish at best. The director resorts to the whole bugs and maggots thing to creep out the viewer. It fails to do so. The editing is unintentionally sketchy and just unprofessionally done. But why is that a surprise, everything about the movie is unintentional. Who makes a bad movie on purpose? Avoid even on a slow night. I recommend the more recent ""Monster"" with Charlize Theron instead. It deals with what provokes a serial killer and the performance by Theron is unbeatable."
2,Where are we???,"I know the John Wayne Gacy story, I live in Chicago, how could I not???But where are we in this movie? The scenes follow no order and give the audience no clue as to where we are in his life at any given point in the movie. Not only that, but most of the scenes seem to ""cut off"" too early as if they were edited for TV to fill a time-slot. The whole thing is one big confusing mess.That being said, the portrayal of Gacy by Mark Houlton was really good. He looks like him physically and pulls off friendly, yet scary appearance very well. He makes this movie worth watching. THe one thing that the writers/directors did well in this was to not get psychological. They simply portray what was actually done, without trying to explain WHY Gacy killed people. He was a serial killer, nobody knows what he was thinking... THe movie succeeded in staying very objective.Worth watching on a rainy day.P.S. NOt really much discussed about POGO the clown, even though it's on the cover."
3,GACY: A low budget look at a killer,"Once in a while I like to be scared by a movie. I remember the true story of mass killer John Wayne Gacy when it hit the papers in the 1970's.For all of the obvious faults that exist in this film due to budget, or lack thereof (the audio commentary is exquisite in information), Mark Holton as the ""clown"" killer is downright creepy.The film succeeded in scaring me,and I was tense most of the film.In that, I commend writer/director Clive Saunders for making my $2.00 investment worthwhile. This kind of film is not my usual fare, but Mark Holton is so bizarre as Gacy that his performance excuses the rest of this pretty ""on a string"" creep-out"". Really not that bad all considered."
3,A good enough movie about about a good enough killer,"I went into this movie with some knoledge of John Wayne Gacy and was surprised to see how well protrayed he was, how well the murders were portrayed, and how well the story was portrayed.A lot of reviewers were not pleased with the movie, but I must say that it was entertaining. Although this is not the movie you go out and buy, it is one worth renting."
1,gacy sucks,Who ever made this film should have a gun pointed at them and be made to swear that they will never grace our screens again.
2,NEEDED SOME WORK...,"THIS MOVIE NEEDED MORE BLOODY SCENES. THE OTHER SERIAL KILLERS' MOVIES WERE A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THEN THIS. THIS ONE HAD A GOOD PLOT BUT THEN STOPPED THERE. IT SHOULD BE RE DONE WITH MORE GORE. AND GACY WAS A CLOSET HOMO WHO NEVER WANTED ANYONE TO KNOW. I THINK I COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS MOVIE BETTER. BUT THEN AGAIN ALL PEOPLE THINK THEIR MOVIES ARE THE BEST. ANYWAY THIS MOVIE WAS OKAY, BUT NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT. MY ADVICE IS WATCH IT IF YOU WANT JUST MAKE SOMEONE ELSE PAY FOR THE RENTAL. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING..."
1,Wrong drive wrong price,"When I searched for this item (TS-OPHD-H3.0T) via Google, it reported that Amazon had it NEW for $69.95. When you follow the link to Amazon not only is the price wrong ($259)but it's not even the correct drive. Note that the correct drive has a carrier tray that allows you to swap the drive into the Terastation Pro II chassis. This is a bare drive. A really really overpriced bare drive at that. Run fast and run far from this Amazon item."
5,Great Tips For All Business Owners,"The Intuitive Business Woman helped me see more clearly how my type - adventurer/visionary - affects my business. I realize that knowing more about myself can help me in choosing the right employees for the tasks best suited to their type. The test is easy and fun and could save a business person from a making a very expensive mistake by hiring the wrong people. It also helped me better understand why I respond the way I do to people and events in my business and personal life. The examples Judy and Todd provide make it easy to relate to. I believe that this is a must read for all business people - not just women. Understanding more about myself is key to my success in business and I will use The Intuitive Business Woman as my guide to employing the best people for the job, partnering with the right people for new opportunities and continuing my self exploration."
1,"Good price, but an off taste","I love toasted sesame oil in so many ways -- I use it in hummus instead of tahini, love to drizzle over stir fry, add it to salad dressings, peanut sauce, put a touch of it on hot veggies. So of course, I was excited to get a large quantity at a great price like this, but.....oh my word.This has a somewhat off taste, and not a taste of rancidity, either - I can identify that. To me it seems more like a chemical aftertaste. Not pleasant, and definitely not worthy of the name ""Ambrosia"" Will not buy this brand again."
2,Let the English Teachers love this one... I'm outta here,"This book is a good example of an author flaunting his formidable language skills instead of telling the story. In this book he digresses often into fanciful descriptions of things that do not have even the most remote relevance to the story. Read an abridged version or watch the movie, but don't subject yourself to the unabridged version."
1,What an utter disappointment,"I hated this book and here is why :1.) Way too verbose (like a literature novel) for an action novel.2.) Too much boring character development (to the point of being a distraction to the plot)3.) Very slow. The plot took forever to develop. There was no suspense in the middle of the book.4.) Terrible ending (the worst ending I could have imagined for this plot)The only good thing I can say about this book1.) I read it on the plane, so I really didn't ""waste"" my time per say, since I had to kill the time anyway."
3,Why the Big Deal?,"I enjoyed this book, but I had a hard time figuring out what makes it a classic -- the characters are kind of flat and although the plot is interesting, I found it a bit outlandish at times. Overall, this is entertaining but not perfect."
4,"""Their brains had not merely been washed....","....they had been dry cleaned.""It is the height of the Korean War when Raymond Shaw and 10 other men on an Intelligence and Reconaissance patrol are captured by Communist Chinese forces. The men are systematically brainwashed, with the survivors released, believing Shaw saved the unit in heroic fashion.Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor for his perceived bravery, but he carries a secret deep in his subconscious; he is a sleeper-assassin for Soviet-Chinese handlers and is manipulated into a mission to change the course of history...a blueprint dealt through a queen of diamonds.Author Richard Condon utilizes an uneven text to take the reader on a wild ride with Shaw, his dysfunctional mother, who has a secret life, and former patrol members whose nightmares hint at the truth. Though ultimately a period piece - initially published in 1959 - it remains a solid psychological thriller."
2,"This is a play, not the book","My fault, by the way, but this is the play version (like for the theater), not the actual book....I prolly should have payed better attention when ordering....."
1,Very very dukk.,"This book was extremely dull, and not very good reading. I think the author was paid by the word, because every person who ever THOUGHT about North Carolina seemed to be in the book. As a voracious reader, I was disapointed."
4,The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina,The information included in this book was very informative and interesting to all who read it. It is a good composite of NC History.
2,Great for a new user but not for the experienced user!,"I'm a long time user of ACT, and I was looking for a book that would provide guidance on more advanced topics, such as generating reports, synching, etc. This book would be great for the novice user of ACT 2005, but it doesn't contain much coverage of more advanced topics. The book is well written,logically arranged and quite readable, but you can probably get everything that it contains from the user's manual. If you are an experienced user, keep looking!"
4,How to and reference manual for ACT! 7,The new ACT! 7 is not just an upgrade as previous long term ACT! users will have become accustomed from previous release version. ACT! 7 is a total rewriting of the product from the ground up. Although many of the features and operations will be familiar there is now a lot more available to the ACT! 7 user.After looking at a number of the new ACT! books on the market Edward Kachinske seemed to have the best pedigree of any of the authors. The book is comprehensive and well written.
4,"Basic, well written","This is a basic but systematic book describing the basics of Act 2005. Do not expect too much, but the style and the practical examples are much better than the product manual. You are motivated to do certain tasks and while you perform the exercise, you learn the philosophy of the software. What I really missed is the in-depth description of the software, but as I mentioned, this is a basic book, as an introduction."
3,"Not ""entirely"" necessary...","Though it does provide a good step by step sequence of performing specific tasks, I found I rarely used the book. After following the interactive training provided w/ ACT! 2005, most things were self explanatory and after I fumbled my way through it once, it was a piece of cake!JOE"
5,Easy to read and full of great info.,This book is easy to follow and helps clear up many questions on this new version of ACT. It is a must have for all new ACT 2005 users!
4,Webop Cubop,"San Francisco may seem an unlikely place for the spirit of Cuban music to thrive (what about Miami?), but this is certainly the case with the Cubop record label. While other labels (RMM, Concord) lay on the smooth production, Cubop stays true to the roots, emphasizing the clavé, horns, and percussion that are at the music's core. ""Viva Cubop: Jazz and the Afro-Cuban Way"" is a 13-song sampler featuring the legends and new cats that are keeping the music vibrant and alive. Artists like conguero Francisco Aguabella, one of Cuba's greats; Papo Vazquez, who fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms with his sensatational trombone playing; Bobby Matos, a leading figure in Latin Jazz; John Santos, a master of percussion; and London's Snowboy, who popularized the music in Europe. The subtitle of this CD should be ""a taste of the real thing,"" since it is."
5,bridge instruction,"This book was recommended by our bridge teacher as a MUST for learning bridge. It is easy to follow and allows for teasting as you go along. It makes the rules concise, complete and simple."
3,Not What I expected,Basically you'll find five variations of a chord and I did not see many of the easier variations. I think you could find something better.
4,Chord Book,"The Picture chord encyclopedia does provide some of the best possibilities for guitar chords and its inversions.Though, I would like to see in these books an introduction of basic harmonic construction."
5,Electic harp adds interest,Sileas goes deeply into the possibilities of an electric harp added to their lever harps - Celtic music expanded!! They also cover a couple of recent songs. This would be a good second Sileas CD to own.
2,seriously lacking,"Once upon a time, the ""Let's Go"" guides were the best budget travel guides on the market. Times change, however, and the 2003 Italy edition is lacking in nearly every department. While the book is fairly useful for the large cities, there's practically nothing beyond that and absolutely null when it comes to anything off the beaten path. And although Italy may no longer be a budget destination, good deals can be found, just not in this guidebook. Stick with Rough Guide."
1,A letdown,"At first glance in the bookstore, this book seems like it would be extremely helpful for my travels in Italy. However, upon my arrival to Italy, the book was not much help. The times listed for how long it took to get from one city to another were not accurate (off by three hours in one instance!), and when I used to directions to try to find my hotel, I was led astray. Luckily I had friends with me that had Rick Steve's book. His was very good!"
2,This not Asian America,"As an Asian American guy born in America, I think I am as American as Apple Pie. Unfortunate, neither society or Asian American girls see me that way.For as long as I can remember I have been searching for my Asian America and after 23 years of searching. I have come to the conclusion that is there is no Asian America.If you are an Asian guy, this movie will despressed the hell out of you. I am not sexist and I don't own Asian American women. They are their own people, but it sadden me that they feel no connection with their own people who have been marginalize in mainstream white american culture. White America has effective brainwashed a generation of Asian American girls and emasculate a generation of Asian American boys.Aren't we allow to fall in love?"
1,An Uncle Tom Asian American Film,"This film calls itself an Asian American film but is really an Uncle Tom work that panders to a mostly non-Asian audience.To give you an example of how offensive this film is, the Asian father (the only Asian male character in this supposed Asian American movie) at one point stares into his own home from outside while all his Asian daughters are with their White trophies inside.This film is a poor man's 'Joy Luck Club', which is another pandering self-hating work that celebrates Asian women who love their White Knights. To call this film an Asian American film is an insult."
3,informative but not a do it yourself at home book,"I got this book because I was curious about the symptoms of exposure to the various agents listed and interested in treatment of a victim.For your money you get descriptions of 27 different things you really do not want to get exposed to, symptoms, treatment and prevention are also mentioned. Drugs and dosages for each subject are listed (most of this stuff the private citizen can't get ahold of anywhere, some of it would be hard for most Doctors to find.), some of it is administered by injection, some orally and some by intravenous drip.There are pretty extensive reference lists at the end of each chapter (John Q. Public won't have any access to most of it)and Q&A; tests for the reader.Not really suited for the average person but aimed at trained medical people."
1,Yawn!!!,What a boring book. Most all of this information can be found on the internet for free. This book is just another example of the hysteria imposed on citizens of this country. We will likely never be exposed to these agents and are probably more likely to die in our sleep from boredom due to reading this book!
5,best scented lotion ever,"This is a very reasonably priced organic product. It is the best scented lotion ever, and is nicely rich and very effective. It is one of my favorite little luxuries."
5,"So good, I subscribed","I first tried this brand and scent locally. It was sometimes sold out, so I found it here and now subscribe to have them mailed to my house. I wash my hands a lot at work and add moisture back easily with this lotion. Smells very nice too."
3,Very Sweet Smelling,"A house guest had left behind a small amount in a tube. I thought I really liked the lotion and the scent so I bought it through Amazon. The scent of the new bottle was much stronger and sweeter than I had expected. I didn't think the quality was worth the money, either."
3,Does the job,"It doesn't leave your skin feeling very soft, but it's body wash-- your body gets washed, and that's about it!"
4,Retro Tee,"This tee shirt has a simple yet classic logo that isn't too busy. There aren't alot of colors to choose from but you really only need red, white, or blue. The graphics allow the shirt to be worn by any age."
3,Some Shining Stars...but...,"Personally, i thought some of the poems in this book were incredible. Especially Nicole Blackman's ""Iris""-Which is quoted in this book's review. Other than that there are some other really good Poems, but i also highly reccommend Blood Sugar By Nicole Blackman-which is a collection of her works-because she kind of gets lost in ""Verses that Hurt"" This book also has many obscene and sexual poems, which i did not find to my liking. This is why i only gave it 3 stars. If you would like to buy this book for afew great poems, go for it-but keep in mind that you are also getting the obscene, bad poems as well. If not, then look at Blood Sugar by Nicole Blackman, which is extremely good."
5,It is the best of the best poetry today,"I loved this book, and my friend is currently holding it hostage. It has all different types of styles from females as well as males and minorities. the book really peaked my curiosity to the wonderful world of poetry and spoken word. John S Hall was my favorite and I've found out he has a band. It's definitely a great buy!"
4,Loved it Each Time I picked it up.,"I like reading poetry one at a time then sitting the book down. Everytime I read a poem I loved it, but not enough to make me want to hurry up and pick up the book again."
4,Cool product,"My boys got this upgrade for Christmas (6 and 8). It's a nice addition to the Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100 kit and I'm considering the next upgrade. If something goes wrong with your kit, Elenco has great customer service and you can order individual parts from their website."
4,I Like it,I would have given it five stars but some of the projects don't work as stated in the book. but it is still cool.
5,Great educational & fun toy,Something safe yet encourages interest and creativity. Glad I bought the upgrade kit at the same time. My 9 year old grandson found this to be one of his favorite Christmas toys. I plan to buy the even bigger upgrade kit for his next birthday.
5,Just what I needed............,"Rocket Shot is the perfect pick me up energy drink. I prefer the Orange Mango over the Berry Blast for flavor, but they both taste good, at least better than the after taste off Red*ull. I wanted a energy drink to help curb my Dr Pepper addiction, this way I could still have the pep but without the extra junk. There is not to much caffine or tourine so as to have you bounce off the walls, it is just perfect............."
4,Cheap product that works pretty good,"I bought this laser to replace an expensive laser I purchased for my PK380 made by Viridian(which I didnt like at all).The laser adjustment is a bit of a pain in the butt, but not too hard... (you losen the direction you want to move the laser towards and then tighten the opposite side)I fired a couple hundred rounds throught my PK380 and it has not gone off target yet.Mine came with 2 switches... one is a simple slide switch that worked great for about 2 weeks and then started to get lose and the laser would turn on/off.the 2nd switch was a pressure switch and that seems to be great.overall... its a great cheap laser and will do the job is ya dont play and mess with it constantly like I did and wear out the switch.very accurate and well worth the money...I will probably buy a few more in the upcoming months..."
1,NcStar Red Laser Sight,"Never even got a chance to try it out. It striped while trying to site it in. Very cheap construction, terrible design for adjusting laser. Would not recommend. With full battery laser would only reach 50 to 60 feet. Outside casing very strong, inside was held together with cheap glue and the spring that holds the battery in place."
3,Not bad but not good,This is not a bad piece especially for such a cheap price. The laser is solid and has a good weight. Its not a light little thing. It was a pain to sight correctly but then again all it takes is patience. Not sure how it holds up after a couple hundred rounds yet but seems pretty nice out of the box and looks decent on the gun. The toggle switch isnt the greatest idea but it does work and it easy to switch on with your trigger finger while holding the gun. At this price you can just buy a new one if it breaks in the next couple of months. I would recomend this for someone looking for a inexpensive laser.(UPDATE - It does not do very well after a couple hundred rounds! It was difficult to keep this piece sighted correctly. After just 1 clip the laser had moved. I was disapointed at best. It still is a a good price and I guess if you only had to shoot once or twice it would work just fine)
3,Works great but just a heads up...,"I'll be short, sweet, and to the point with this one:Pros:-Metal, therefore really sturdy and durable.-Fits snugly and tightly to your RIS.-Adjustable with the tools included.-Batteries included.Works amazing wonders in a night game or ""not as bright"" environment.Cons:-On a cloudless day (and even with a few clouds unless you look really hard) it's almost if not impossible to see the laser on a target more than three feet from you.-depending on if you use a strap or sling for your weapon (I had this problem with a budget strap), sometimes the switch can accidentally be pressed to ""on"", thus wasting your battery.-Be careful putting the batteries in because sometimes they get stuck.Overall a great addition...if it isn't too bright to extinguish your sight."
5,Works great,Easy to install and it was nice that it came with batteries. I love how you turn it on and the laser is a pretty descent one.
4,On a Taurus 24/7 OSS DS .45,Easy installation.Easy setup with elevation and windage adjusting screws.Maybe 15-20 minutes adjusting for a 6 o'clock hold with 3 dot sights.Sighted for 10 yards.Will shoot this weekend for accuracy and durability.
5,What I expected and more,"Works good for use on air gun. Thinking about ordering another for rifle. Easy to install and adjust, just dont be in a hurry when adjusting. Holds sighting well. Would recommend."
3,More form than function,"Mounted this on a Beretta PX4 Storm INOX 9mm. Took to the range, after each shot, the laser would turn off and you would need to switch back on again. I am going to try to mount it a little more forward in the mount (the laser can be moved front/back inside the mount that hooks to the rail) and see if that helps. Right out of box, the laser needs to be sighted in, but it was fairly accurate with no adjustment. On a paper target, if I aimed dead center, I was missing low, so just elevation adjustment was needed and a little windage to correct off center misses. Overall, it looks great on the gun, fits perfect and is not bulky. However, the laser needs some adjustment and I am concerned about it turning off when shot/recoils."
4,good for the price,"Paid $14 and has worked well so far, surpassing my expectations. Fits ok on the XD 9mm 4"". Took about about ten minutes to get the laser sighted in at 10 yards. everything loosened up after about 40 rounds probably because I was in a hurry to put it on the first time. After retightneing it stayed put for another 160 rounds. If it happens again a little blue loctite outta take care of it. Not sure how long it will last, but I have had good luck with all NcStar products."
1,Cheap Laser DOA,A solid mount but a cheaply constructed laser assembly. The batteries are hard to install. Probably best done off the firearm which would likely require reaiming. I never had the chance because the unit was DOA. Batteries were good. I returned the unit and bought a LaserLyte SubCompact for four times the price and am delighted. Amazon is wonderful about returns if you still want to try the NcStar.
3,Not very bright,"This is okay, in low light situations.However, it is not bright enough to see in daylight, whatsoever.I cannot recommend this item, unless it is all you can afford."
4,Great for the price!,"I bought this for my everyday carry, my Kel-Tec PF9. Its small enough to fit perfectly on my gun and gives my better accuracy for those high stress situations. Great buy for what it is."
2,Not Great,"It did not come with any supporting documentation on how to sight it in...also the firing causes the laser to go off...I will continue to tinker with it, maybe I'm doing something wrong (again, I don't know because it doesn't tell you how to sight it). If I can find a way to fix it I will update you...until then save your money, because I'm probably sending it back."
1,Not for me,"I was excited to mount this to my new Ruger SR40 and take it to the shooting range yesterday. After one shot it shut off and went in and out while I was shooting. Then the laser inside shifted when it did work so it was not accurate too. I'm returning it now, and I wish it did work."
2,pass,I purchased this for around 10.00 on of the adjustment scres stripped out before i had a chance to sight the laser in. Too cheap to be effective.
2,Laser sight issues,The laser sight didn't fit my sw40ve I had to buy a rail mount adapter once I did so it worked fairly well.
3,Fun and interesting product.,This product makes your bb gun/ paintball gun/ real gun look like the ones on TV. The laser sighting is accurate and cool to use. It works fine on a bb gun or paintball gun which do not have much recoil. It doesn't hold well on a real gun (my friend tried it on a pistol). Nonetheless I will use it for a bb gun sight and a laser pointer for presentations.
2,Great for an air gun. Not for a real gun.,"After installing this laser and trying it out at the range a few of things became evident immediately. 1) Every other shot the switch will flip itself off from the inertia of the recoil. 2) Unless the battery cap/power switch is screwed in with a healthy dose of loctite, you can expect the thing to come unscrewed from the laser every third to fourth shot. 3) The dot will not stay zeroed. The shock from the recoil has the thing in a slightly different position after every 2nd shot if not after every single shot. I installed it well, making sure all the mounting surfaces were oil free and put loctite on everything, but this laser just is not made to handle the shock from recoil when attached to a real pistol."
2,Not worth it if you expect at least some quality,"I got this from ebay for the same price. The first thing I notice out of the box was the cheap construction. The on/off switch was made of cheap plastic. The rest was aluminum, I'm pretty sure it wasn't aircraft grade... Instead of a dot the laser is a flat line. In my opinion you could get a better laser pointer from the store. Just remember you get what you pay for, so don't be very mad if you get this and its not what you expected."
2,NC Star Tactical Weaver Rail Laser Sight,"Pretty much what I expected. Package had been opened & instructions were missing, however not too difficult to figure out. Shipper did include instruction on battery install."
1,Doesn't Fit,Laser did not fit firearm shown in link in Amazon search. Return policy of airsplat sub-subsupplier was not acceptable.
2,NCstar laser,Not impressed. I realize this is not an expensive item but I expected more.the alignment mechanism in the laser is very cheap and easily strips out. Wouldn't buy again.
3,red laser,I went to the range this weekend the laser was ok the batterie cap loosen up alot which makes the laser shut off other then that its a good laser for the price.
1,Poorly made and impossible to adjust,"I had a lot of trouble with this item, not only because of its shoddy construction, but also because it was incredibly difficult to sight in. After having not too much luck with thePressure Switch for Red LasersI bought for this laser sight, I eventually gave up and reattached the original switch. I attached it to my WASR 10/63 and tried to sight it in using the allen wrench that came with it, only to find out that even the tiniest adjustment sent the red dot flying across the target. I shifted the little adjustment screws back and forth for about a half hour until I eventually gave up and threw this piece of crap directly into the garbage. This sight was a colossal waste of time. At least I got a couple of decent allen wrenches out of it."
1,Doesn't last,"I was impressed by the laser and after reading some of the reviews had hopes. Alas as I read for some, it didn't hold it's sight very well, and after about 2 clips it just stopped working. It may be a nice laser pointer, but as soon as you attach it to anything with recoil, it seems to vibrate itself to death."
4,nice laser,"I bought this to use as a fecal factor of someone seeing a laser dot run across the ground and up their leg. once sighted in however, i was pleasantly surprised at how well it held it's accuracy. the batter cap came unscrewed after 150 rounds, but a drop of loctite later all was well. i ran another 400 9mm rounds through my sidearm and the laser held it's accuracy flawlessly. i am pleased with the weight, size, looks, and most importantly the cost. quality buy."
4,laser,"I think this item is great for the price, very easy to install and align,Don't tighten the screws to tight or you may have a problem. I don't think I would put it on any thing but a BB or air gun, I don't know how it would hold up to heavey recoil. But for the price can't go wrong."
3,OK sight,"I bought this laser a few months ago and it is still holding up, granted im only useing it on an airsoft gun, it still has a blowback action to put this to the test. The laser is metal and the dot is clearly visible... indoors. If you are planning on bringing this outside, don't buy it, you can barely see the dot on the ground next to your feet let alone 30ft away. Though for the price, you can't beat it, if your looking for an amazing laser with pin-point accuracy, your also looking at 60-400 dollars..."
4,workable laser,mounts good--sight adjustment is a real challange as there are no instructions provided--short to mid range application works best except in bright sunlight---packaged good and shipped quickly
3,Good red laser but,I purchased this for my Smith and Wesson Sigma 9mm. I also got the laserlyte attachment rail for it and it all went together nicely. I took the gun to the range and put a few hundred rounds out. I like the sight but the back where the battery screw on part goes keeps coming undone! After every 3rd shot or so I would have to turn it to get the dot to come back on. I even mounted it next to the trigger guard so it is resting against it. Not sure what I am doing wrong but I plan on taping or gluing the part so it quits unscrewing.
2,"Good for Pellet/22 LR, Not for Larger Calibers.","I loved the possibility of a low-cost laser pointer; cheap, simple, and effective would be a great combination! Unfortunately, this unit is not only difficult to sight in but it doesn't hold sight location for pistols with ANY recoil. The really tiny hex screw adjustment system is very difficult to use - with non-intuitive interaction between different screws. Once sighted in and the screws tightened down, a single shot from a Walther PK380 - a medium-caliber pistol with an exceptionally light recoil - knocked the sight off-center. Also note that this is not a tiny sight - it barely fit on the Walther, which is a medium-sized pistol (3.6 in barrel). Would probably work great for an Air pistol/rifle or even 22 LR pistol/rifle. Not so for anything more powerful, unfortunately."
1,Too small,"I own a Smith and Wesson Sigma 9mm and this laser did not fit the rail as well as it could have. I'm sure if you can get one to fit a firearm, it would be an ok laser."
2,50/50,"Initially everything was great. I mounted the laser on my Sig Mosquito easily without effecting the slide (there have been issues with tactical mounts causing the slide to bind). Attempting to sight in the laser was excruciatingly annoying. It never actually zeroed, there just wasn't enough adjustment for it to actually work. Later I notice that the laser has a very hard time staying lit, it's clearly not shock resistant. At least I got a decent dog toy for my black lab. She loves it. Overall, no problem with Amazon, just a low quality product."
1,Never got to work...,"In short, the product had a built in short somewhere in the housing. Would have been to expensive to return for another, so bought a higher quality product."
2,Negative,What you have here is a Laser. Thats it. You can mount it. But it will not act as a real site. Pass.
1,NcStar cheap china product,What a waste of my money! The switch is so sloppy you are lucky if it comes on once with 20 flips of the switch.Don't waste your $$$$
1,Both did not work.,My first one did not work even with new batteries. The return and replacement was simple and fast but the replacement doesn't work either.
3,DECENT,The sight appears decent however the process for adjusting windage and elevation leave a lot to be desired. Also. the base while susposedly suitable for Weaver rails needs to be openned up to fit properly.In both cases the adjustments are difficult and not easily managed. There seems to be not enough of one and too much of the other.Still for the price and they are decent pieces of equipment.
2,This toy is for decoration only,"I got it for a few months ago. It is small and nicely fit on my Beretta M9A1 making the gun look very cool :) I did a test drive at my local range last weekend, it did not survive the shock of 9mm, turned on/off and lost zero unpredictable. Just took it off, I can not rely on it for my home defense since I might shoot at my family members rather than the bad guy if a situation may happen."
1,Piece of junk,"I was really very excited about the price on this, but as soon as I got it I KNEW there was gonna be trouble. I got it very fast, with all the parts, which is the only reason i gave this thing 1 star. As the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. I took it to the range, sighted it in, and within three rounds had to readjust, then, 3 more round, rinse and repeat for over an hour. So i decided to give it a break, sight it in and then go home, the next week i went back to the range per the usual, and put it on to see if it had improved while it sat in my bag (because gnomes tend to fix things at night). But, low and behold, it was off set by a large difference, and so I just gave it the old tin burial. I wouldn't recommend this to my enemy.However, and its a fairly loose however, if you felt like putting this thing on one of your plastic pellet game guns, it might works as long as you never removed it, and that's a HUGE might. If so, good luck with that."
3,"Decent, but could be a bit better","It fit perfectly on my P99 replica airgun. The laser sight is very bright, can be seen in daylight, and shows well up to 30 feet. I found adjusting the laser to the iron sights on this gun very tedious. I would recommend for the price. Other consumers may find it easier to work with. I am not pleased with the fact it takes three batteries either...perhaps for more power, but seems a bit un-neccessary. Regardless, it is a decent product, bright and easy to install on weaver rails. But, hard to sight in so be patient."
1,You get what you pay for,"Well, what did I expect for the price? What a horrific little piece of junk. Difficult to sight in and won't hold zero without Loctite on the adjustment hex screws, that is, if you don't strip them out like 90% of the buyers seem to have done with this little gem of Chinese engineering.It may be suitable for toy guns, like Airsoft, but not for real weapons.Save your money folks and buy a real laser, like a Viridian."
1,Piece of junk,"I spent two days trying to sight it in but whenever I managed to get the laser spot in the accurate position, after a few hours it had moved again and I had to do the adjustments all over again. So basically it was useless from the very start.After two days of making adjustments, the screws that I had to fasten and loosen every time again to adjust the position of the laser beam, broke off and made this thing even more useless.Of course you get the quality you pay for. But at the end of the day, the couple of bucks that I tried to save buying this cheap product does in no way justify the amount of frustration that I experienced with this flimsy product.I am very frustrated by this product and advise strongly against buying it."
3,"great price , switch turns on too easy in a soft case","holds zero , decent light, great price, keep spare batteries around as the switch turns on very easy if stored or transported in a soft case ie the spare batt's , if it sits on your night stand great! easy to turn on very light."
4,NcStar Laser,"Overall, I am satisfied with this product. However, there are a couple of drawbacks. First, adjusting the laser is quite difficult and time consuming. Patience is certainly required. Second, the batteries that came with the laser ran out of power very quickly. I bought a 3 pack of A76/LR44 batteries to replace those that came with the laser, and I have not experienced any additional problems with battery life."
1,NcStar Red Laser Sight/Weaver Mount Review,"I ordered this sight for my Glock 19 knowing full well it was cheaper and likely to have some issues, but I decided to give it a shot. The sight mounts on the accessory rail just fine, looks good and the laser is crisp. However, the sight is practically impossible to sight in. I spend 2 hours adjusting it and was never successful in zeroing the laser. Returning it."
3,Functional and practical but not perfect,"I had previously ordered the rail-mounted light from NcStar and was extremely pleased with the build quality and value for the product. Knowing I could trust the brand, i ordered the laser sight as well expecting the same level of quality and was slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the product works and feels solid but I've had some trouble zeroing it and aligning it to where my shots hit. It comes with two allen wrenches, one to install and one to adjust elevation and windage, but the adjustment process is imprecise and clunky at best. It's worth the price, but keep in the mind the price is low for a reason."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Do not waste your time on this product it arrived non-functional due to a grounding issue with the battery cover/switch. It is a good size and seems like it would be a nice addition to a range pistol; however, it is very poorly constructed and likely would not hold up to the recoil and the battery cover would likely come unscrewed as there is no rubber o-ring to hold it in place."
4,Nice laser for the price,"this is a decent laser for the price i bought this for my M10 ak 47, and it works fine. my only complaint was that the batteries were old and didnt last long. that is the only bad thing i have to say about this laser!!!"
3,Functions well,"Not sure what some folks are looking for in a $15 laser sight. I purchased it to possibly help in dry fire practice. I can only mount it on the rail once the two mounting screws are removed, not just loosened. Adjusting the sight alignment is a pain, not sure how tight to tighten the set screws. Returned from the range (SS P250 9mm) and discovered that two of the tiny set screws are missing. Hoping to get a few in the mail without going through warranty... we'll see.One thing I may try, if I get the set screws and I get it aligned correctly, possibly putting a dab of pain on the set screw heads to help keep them from vibrating loose.My switch works fine and its tight on the rail when mounted. Just be careful with the set screws."
3,Eh,"I attempted to use this on a Taurus 92 9mm. I fired 3 shots and the laser turned off and I went to adjust it and it nearly fell off. I had tightened as much as I felt comfortable doing which should have been adequate. My suggestion is that if you want to have this on your firearm full time (I prefer a tactical light for home use) use screw glue on the 3 main tension screws and then sight it. Glue may not be enough, but I can't say, so you may want to shop around some more. It was cheap and sighting it was easy enough using the four screws around the lens. Would be good for a .22 rifle or with glue a permanent laser sight."
3,not bad for the price.....but adjustment is NOT great,"works .....but adjustment maxes and its still not lined up with sights......which i guess is what is to be expected for the price....also switch seems ""loose"" functions fine.......but seems flimsy"
2,Average laser sight,"Average laser sight not perpect product but if you don't have a budget to get a discent Red Laser Sight I can recommend this,its okay."
2,not good,"ok I put this laser on a sig 22 pistol,very hard to zero,and the zero screw stripped.this is not a good product,its cheap,and it shows!!"
4,"Red laser, Sweeet","Just got this the other day. all metal construction, very nice. Laser has great range can even see with ease in day time. Definitely worth the money."
3,"Good price, poor adjustment quality","For the price and overall performance of a laser sight, this is good. I've mounted this on a Ruger P95 (9mm) handgun and the laser stayed true despite 100 rounds. The only problem with this model/maker is that the fine tune adjustment will STRIP EASILY!!! Beware of this.I've ordered 2 unit from Amazon and both of them had the find tune adjustments strip on me during some minor adjustment. BUT...if you are careful during the 1st tuning and don't remove the laser, then the unit is fine. If, you were to site it for longer/shorter yardage, then you will have a very likely chance of stripping.Overall, good but, but don't expect to keep playing with the adjustment screws. Just CAREFULLY true the laser 1 time, and DO NOT REMOVE OR ADJUST the laser."
1,Yeah.................No. Not for an actual firearm.,"Keep in mind I'm writing this review from the standpoint of a firearm user and not an air-soft/paintball user. This laser would probably be excellent for an air-soft gun given the nonexistent recoil. However, I mounted this laser to my Generation 4 Glock 17 pistol and it malfunctioned very quickly. The lens came out of place due to weapon recoil and nothing could be done to get it back into proper working condition. At $15, it wasn't much of a loss, but it is still disappointing considering I was looking for a cheap laser that would do its job."
4,Very pleased with the product and the very low price.,I am very pleased with the quality of the product. I suspect that the price is so low because the directions for placing the batteries are backwards. Basically I followed instructions and the laser would not light. I reversed the batteries and everything works fine. I look forward to trying it out on the range.
1,POS laser,"Rail mount works great, adjustments for laser work alright, however... the laser's on/off switch doesn't function correctly. Even in the on position the laser will randomly go off and you have to tap it for it to come back on. Now after about a week of use I'm luck if the laser stays on 5% of the time. The rest of the time it keeps shutting it's self off because the switch is so janky. It's not as if I can tape it down or something, it simply ceases functioning. Now I can't even use it. I might as well throw it in the trash. What a crappy laser."
1,Excellent Laser,"i got this laser for my sa177 bb gun. it works great i had to sight it properly now it shoots right where the laser is aimed atTheres one problem though, because the sa177 delivers a shocking blowback. the laser sometimes turns off, then you have to take the batteries out and put them back in. this is just annoying doesnt take that much time to do.but overall its a very good laser. very very long rangeeEDIT: The adjustment screw on my laser broke from adjusting because the laser keeps going off sight since it broke its way off from the shooting point so no point of even turning it on. very cheap laser recommmend yu NOT buy"
3,DOES NOT FIT HI-POINT 45 acp,Gave it 3 stars because it didn't fit my gun. never got to use it. however it shipped fast and it works. So for future reference a Hi-point 45acp does NOT have a weaver rail.
2,Not a good product in my case!,"Maybe I got a lemon but I had to return it, found it impossible to adust it!Is easy to install, laser works great, looks cool on the gun and is a very good price.If you want to try it, you should! Again, mine was probably damaged and good luck aligining that red dot:)"
1,peice of junk,This item did not work out of the box. Broken on/off switch BEWARE of CHEAP JUNK. The batteries were good and worked in another device.
1,A shame...,"I have read many books on the Empress Elizabeth of Austria but this one is the worst of all. The author writes so incredible stories it's a shame. The dates are inexact too. A novel would be much better. The poor Empress if you believe this woman passed half of her life running away with men, hating her husband etc... One star is even a lot. It would be a pity to read, but if you are a collector maybe you'll like, even with that in mind I would never recommend it."
1,Not the mood you may be expecting,"Kinda tacky. Should be advertised under sound effects instead of straight music. The mixing balance seems to favor the water sound overlays, instead of allowing the music that could be enjoyed. Also, especially on Undine, it seems like the piano was recorded in a hallway with one mike, while the ocean sounds, unfortunately, kept its microphone above the water.I'll just pass it on to my 3 year old niece for her birthday next month. Kids are so forgiving."
2,It's so. sp,"I happen to really like Ravel and Debussy. The Cathedral Engulfed is one of my all time favorites. Thus I figured if I need relaxation music this would be the one. Nice sound of water in the background of water themed classical music. Excellent!No such luck. Ms. Rozenburger is a fine pianist, I guess, but... In two of the Ravel pieces I couldn't even pick out the themes between her playing and the background noise. In 'The Cathedral', the ocean background noise (and I do mean noise) was so annoyingly out of sync with the themes that it was very hard to relax to the music. Normally, Ondine and Goldfish are unexceptional enough, once this CD gets through with them, they are annoying.Oh well. It sounded like a good idea. Or, perhaps, as my son likes to say ""Funny, it didn't work on paper either""."
4,21 Jump Street - The Complete First Season,"A great item to buy for the Johnny Depp lover. Guest star appearances by stars you might recognize to this day as still being popular and famous, such as Brad Pitt for example. Great show and I wish there were shows like this still on TV today."
1,"Those chiding about copyrights don't ""get it""","I am a consumer. If I am wanting to buy this set for some nostalgia, I want to experience AS IT WAS. Not with some revisionist glossed-over editing, regardless of what reasons it was done for. I don't like my CD reissues remixed...I don't want my TV shows edited. It amounts to false advertising if there's no mention made on the packaging and I think THAT should be confronted anytime it ever occurs.If they can't issue the show with the music (which is INTEGRAL to the show in setting the scenes in many cases), it would be better to not do it. That would be like issuing ""Gone with the Wind"" with a CGI character replacing Clark Gable because the family wouldn't let the studio have rights to his ""image and likeness"" cheaply enough. Pish-tosh."
1,It's nothing without the music.,"Wow. After watching part of the DVD and hearing the incredibly lame soundtrack that's been substituted for the hot-at-the-time songs used in the original airings, it must have been the music that made me a fan back then. It certainly wasn't the lame acting and writing, which is much more evident without the original music that must have given the show some extra life and meaning. What a disappointment. It's like meeting an old friend for lunch years later and finding out you really must have never had anything in common. Skip this one."
4,Wow! It holds up pretty well.,"I watched this show in the nineth grade and was a big fan at the time. many of the things I liked from this part of my life don't hold up today. 21 Jumpstreet held up. I hadn't seen the show in over 10 years. I still like it a lot. It has faults like music, 80's styles, some bad performances, but nothing too painful. It is just a good old TV show. Some of the episodes are great. A few episodes realy impressed me. I get more out of it now than I did then. There are some great performances and moments.If you liked it back in the day, you will most likely still enjoy it. Don't expect the greatest show ever made and you shouldn't be disappointed, because 21 Jump Street is one of the better shows ever made."
4,Get Ready To Jump...,"For joy at the release of this much anticipated dvd! I was so excited to find out that my all-time favorite tv series (when I was a teen...*cough...some years ago) was finally being released on dvd. I enjoyed re-visiting the old cast, starring a much younger yet still HOT, Johnny Depp, with my daughters...but the music was horrible! I mean, in all honesty, I don't recall much of the music from the original airing of the show but it's clear that the music was replaced (Thank God the title song was untouched!!!) by....what is that noise? If I wasn't such a huge fan of the series, the music would have ruined this otherwise great dvd for me.Nevertheless, if you can grit your teeth through the horrible soundtrack - it's well worth the buy!"
3,What happened to the music?,"Great show...I loved it when I was younger, BUT...the music has been totally changed. I guess they had some rights issues or something. The music's been replaced by really bad synth-pop (For example, in one of the episodes they had Tone Loc music which has been replaced with some terrible music). If they replaced the music in later seasons then this collection will be utterly useless."
5,21 Jump His Bones,"If you were like me and filled your room with pictures of Johnny Depp after watching his godlikeness on 21 Jump Street, you should rent the first season for an exciting jaunt down memory lane. The two-part pilot is just plain awful and I would skip it. You should move right along to episode one, which has full character development, improved rapport among the actors, and you can catch hilarious and titillating glimpses of what makes Johnny Depp the icon that he is today. Young DeLuis who plays Doug Penhall wasn't too shabby back in the day, either."
4,FINALLY,WELL LET ME START OFF BY SSAYING ITS A ABOUT TIME I LOVE THIS SHOW AND ITS FINALLY COMEING OUT ON DVD I HAVENT SEEN THE SHOW IN YEARS BUT IM STILL A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW ALL FANS WILL BE HAPPY AND I FOR ONE CANNT WAIT TILL OCT. 26 04 THATS WHEN THE FIRST SEASON COMES OUT AND THEN HOPE SECOND COMES OUT REAL SOON
1,21? Nope! This is like 15 Jumpstreet...,21? Nope! This is like 15 Jumpstreet... Only one start...Release the real thing and then we can talk about buying something...
5,21 Jump Street is #1,"Oh Thank you, thank you!! I have been waiting for this, I can't wait til October 26, that's two days after my b-day!! What a gift. This show is the best!"
3,"GLAD TO SEE IT, NOT AS GOOD AS I REMEMBER",I recently picked this up and couldn't wait to see it. The last time I had seen the show I was 12. I was a little dissopointed about the music. It sounds like the music from Scarface. I don't know. I just remember more rock n roll style music. There's thirteen episodes in total. Out of that I would say there are probably 4 or 5 really great episodes. The rest fall in between good and poor. My biggest problem is the story develops very slowly and it's kind of hard to stay interested. Took me over two weeks to get through it. Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast do have great moments throughout but it's not what I remember. Hopefully the next seasons will be better. Great buy if you can find used.
4,Great show!!!!!!!!!!!!,The season that sparked Johnny Depp career is my second favorite season but season 2 is my favorite Season. I am also glad when Frederick Forest gets replaced by Steven Williams.
4,Bought 1st season for $5 at walmart,"I've never seen the series before, but I picked up the complete first season for $5 in Wal-mart and I love it! I'm a big Johnny Depp fan and he's super cute in the show. The version I have is censored; you can tell that some words were added on to cover cursing, etc. but $20 is ridiculous."
1,no extras on this cheap edition,"Beware! Contrary to the description, there are no extras on this cheap, new edition. No interviews and no commentary by Peter DeLuise."
2,I love this show...,"I love this show, and the story was pretty much the after school saccharine special that I remembered it to be.It's hard to believe that this DVD was released by a television studio; if I didn't know better, I would swear it was released by some guy in Taiwan who burned the show onto DVD from the VHS tapes he's recorded in his Mom's basement. The transfer is horrible, looks just like it did years ago on a CRT television. Is it possible that they transferred the show to DVD directly from the VHS? They also did a horrible job of editing. The commercial breaks are poorly done, cutting the shot too soon or sometimes not soon enough. Also, there is some language editing done. You can clearly see that the swear words the character's mouth is making is not the same thing your ears hear.But the TV show...it's great. It's everything that was wonderful about the 80s."
2,Don't throw the videotapes!,"I just got the DVD for Christmas and just got done watching the first episode and it seemed like something was amiss (besides the music). The last scene is missing the beginning AND the end. I have them all on tape off of syndication no less and the DVD version has been cut even more. I don't understand this at all. It's worth owning the DVD if you don't have the shows on tape but if you have the tapes already, don't waste your money, and don't throw the tapes away!!! 5 stars for the show itself and 0 stars for the repackaging!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,This is sooooo not what i thought it was. I thought this was gonna be exactly like i saw it on tv so many years ago. I was watching this show since i was 10 yrs old and now im 28. This show made me want to become a narc. lol. and now Nothing is even near how it was on tv. So many scenes were cut out. All the music is gone and replaced with nonsense. The music is what makes the show along with the stories and the actors. Im hearing all this stuff about music licensing. What gives?!! If your a die hard fan like i am DO NOT BUY THIS. I had vhs tapes of all these episodes and when i saw the dvd was out i threw them all way. WHAT THE HECK DID I DO ??!! I wish i never threw them away. My tapes were the real deal. I wasted so much money on the first 3 seasons only to be disgusted. Save your money.
5,Woo-Hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"They have all these ridiculous shows on coming out on (i.e, ALF) DVD, finally a show with more substance (I'm fibbing, I just love Johnny Depp). I'm looking forward to buying this on October 26.........."
3,Can't go wrong with Johnny,"It's Johnny depp in his first staring role, he's young and gorgeous but its the 80's so the fashion was horrible and the story lines were preachy. Still worth watching just to see johnny bowl."
3,21 jump street season 1,"This was purchased as a gift for a friend and I can only report that she likes this old tv series, thus the purchase of all seasons. i have not seen it myself."
5,This review is of the actual book not the seller.,"I enthusiastically recommend this monograph of Joan Snyder. The book does an excellent job of conveying the emotional power in Snyder's work. There are many full page color pics of Snyder's work throughout the volume. The text is interesting and informative,and thoroughly tells the story of Snyder's career. But the Expressive power of Snyder's paintings comes through loud and clear!"
4,Like being bludgeoned with a sack full of molasses,"If stoned zombies played pissed off death metal, it would most likely resemble the formidable tar pit rock of Warhorse. Stumbling inebriates attempting to walk the line between doom metal and pot rock have forever blurred the distinction between the genres with each accidentally inspired step, and it's in their still fresh path that Warhorse prepare for battle. With who seems to be a moot point. These boys are just looking for a fight. ""As Heaven Turns To Ash"" appears to be burning on a colossal roundup of the world's remaining fossil fuels, belching fire and spitting acid from the depths of a brimming smokestack. The semi-acoustic interludes ""Amber Vial"" and ""Dawn"" by comparison can only be mourning the fact that current technology does not allow the band to get any heavier. So fill the bong one last time and raise a toast to Armageddon."
3,A decent book for undergraduates; a reference for others.,"The book is a decent read for getting a better understanding on the basics in this subject. The best thing about the book is the qualitative and quanitative arangement and explanation of the material. However, the book may be somewhat confusing if this is your first time dealing with the subject. You should at least have some experience using the diode current equation and some familiarity with how this device works in an actual circuit. I also recommend that become comfortable with using Poisson's equation. Chapter 2 is based entirely on it's use.The book is ideal for someone wanting to review pn junction physics but not wanting the drawn out detail that you would find in Shur. If you decide to buy this book, buy Volume I, ""Semiconductors Fundementals."" The authors will make reference to equations in Volume I that won't be found in this one. Yes, they want mo' money!!!"
1,Not quite it,"I love the color and the material, but the cover seems flimsy due to being left open on the top. I could live with that, but the window opening for the screen is not large enough. It covers enough of my viewer that I cannot see the first few letters of each menu item on the screen. I have the 60 gig IPod"
2,"Too much anecdote, not enough facts","This book looked rather like the author decided to make a trip around the country and stopped in at a number of towns to interview people. Based on the interview, he decided whether this was a great retirement place. While some statistical facts are presented, there is little to substantiate ""Joe and Velma's"" statement that ""this is a really nice place to live"". I know several of the places included and had a great deal of difficulty understanding how some of them got into the book (and why some others were left out)."
4,TEXAS - 'INNER SMILE' (MERCURY),"They may have been purveyors of mediocre white soul for the last year or so but this is the first decent Texas track in a long while. 'Inner Smile' is a damned decent tune shouldered by an infectious little groove. Sharleen Spiteri, ever possessed of an impressive pair of lungs, is on fine vocal form and the whole kit and caboodle just burrows into your bonce and refuses to budge. The remixes are suberb."
5,Great filter,"I am a 65 yo woman and I have an 18' round Intex pool and hated the samll cartidge filter it came with. It would stay fairly clean but hard to vacuum, etc. I set this filter up today and am in love~!!! I hooked up the vacuum I purchased and it worked like it was supposed to (what a concept). The water was crystal clear in 2 hours and the bottom clean. I am very impressed. It was slightly hard to install because the directions are not real clear, but if you have some mechanical ability, it can be done. One thing - the hoses were impossible to put on the barbs until I used the hair dryer to soften up the hose ends."
4,great filter,filter is great dependable need a good sand filter this is it.maintenace is easy just empty and refill sand yearly.
2,Joshua Redman keybordist,"This album didn't really exite me; i knew about Sam by his amazin work with Joshua Redman, where he plays great lines with keybords/organ and bass lines as well. This album is played in a completly different mood, very relaxed and lakes any kind of acme or great themes. U won't really like it unless you're a big Yahel fan or play organ"
1,No Learning Value,"Although I thought this watch looks adorable for the princess minded age group, I am disappointed that it lacked numbers indicating the hours. I expect a watch for a child this young,to serve as a teaching tool as well as being fun to wear. I searched for this specific watch, but did not order it because it lacked the numerals."
1,"JUNK, may last a few months, without use","What can I say. Screws fell out. I replaced them but do not stay in, too light to be made of wood! Hinges are plastic inside and fell apart. Started to grow mold! Seat uses only two small plastic pads that fell apart the first time the lid slammed shut. DO NOT BUY, worst piece of junk I've ever owned."
1,Wood toilet seat,I wish I had the same experience as everyone else that has reviewed this seat. I ordered two based on those reviews. One arrived cracked due to poor packaging and they both have a cheap quality feeling. The edges are sort of sharp and the wood feels so lightweight that it feels like it can't be real wood under the veneer. You can see glue coming through at the seams where it makes splotches. The hardware is nice though.
2,"Great at first, but now very Moldy!","I got 3 of these about 2 and a half years ago. I love the way they looked and they are wonderfully comfortable to sit on. However, I have had alot of issues with them developing mold. In fact, the mold is ruining them. So even though they never crack, they have mold growing in them and I can't get it out. I tried using a UV light to kill the mold and then scrubbed like crazy with soft scrub, but no difference, so I guess they're clean, but it looks gross."
3,good text with many typos.,"17th edition. This book has some great information but this is supposed to be a textbook that I would think was proofread. I'm about 1/4 through it and there seems to be quite a bit of missing periods, mis-spelled names, little things like that. For the small fortune this book costs they could have found a better spellcheck program. Example, ""But it is grows so rapidly and is so difficult to kill.....""pg. 201"
3,BOOK COSTS TOO MUCH,"This book costs too damn much. It was required for my Human Ecology course, but they should really think about student budgets before they put that price on a book, and change the edition every year! It is excellent in it's coverage of material, but it still wasn't worth 83 bucks!"
4,Definitely interesting...,"Piero Pelu is an Italian sensation. We heard many of these songs in Italy this summer and they were catchy and easy to understand. My personal favorite is ""Io Ci Saro'"" - I will be there. Pelu is not a romantic or a hard rocker, I wouldn't know how to categorize him. But he is definitely interesting to listen to and you might be surprised how you will find yourself humming his tunes later in the day."
2,What a sham,ok 1st off this collection & Best of Vol 2 are a jip HOW IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S FUNKY CAN YOU HAVE A BAR-KAYS HITS W/O SOUL FINGER????Answer this to me please?All the songs on vol 1 & 2 Hits packages are awesome & the only way i could give this or Vol 2 5 stars is with Soul Finger.That is like having a Skynyrd Hits w/o the 2 REDNECK ANTHEMS on there Sweet Home Alabama & FreeBirdwhat a shaft!!!!
3,Wallowing in the Past,"I've been a huge fan of Carolyn Haines since the beginning of this delightful series, but I'm starting to lose patience with her main character. Part of it may be because I knew the ""who-dun-it"" and ""why"" fairly early on in this book, and therefore I needed the main characters to keep me interested. Also, the lack of the author's usual humor allowed me to see more of the main character's weaknesses, which may have tainted my opinion. Sarah Booth Delaney is a good friend and a good detective, but she also is a miserable woman wallowing in the past. She keeps her history wrapped around her like a cloak to avoid doing anything productive with her life. She might as well go lie down in the family plot and get it over with; the past is where she is most comfortable.Still, one sour experience will not stop me from anticipating the next Mississippi Delta novel."
5,Sassy and cute!,All of us Southern ladies understand the appeal of Sara Booth and her crazy friends. Read the series and get to know them too!
3,"An ethical dilemma, again","Ever since Steely Dan emerged in all its dark glory in the early '70s, there have been various semilegal (read: European and out of the reach of US law) albums containing Becker-Fagen demos from pre-Dan days (when, among other things, they played for Jay and the Americans). Some are songs that the Dan eventually recorded, some never were. The most irritating of the bunch is the soundtrack to an (unreleased?) low-budget film, ""YOU GOTTA WALK IT LIKE YOU TALK IT OR YOU'LL LOSE THAT BEAT"" - the title is the best part, I'm afraid. So now it's the buyer's decision: pick up on some interesting scraps (I'm not being sarcastic) to see where the boys came from, or refuse to support recordings that they certainly would not want for sale (these releases have usually come under the name ""Becker-Fagen,"" so at least that's sort of honest). I would say it's pretty much for Dan fanatics. Your call, friend."
3,collectors and fanatics will appreciate this,"The only thing I can add to the reviews posted above is a caveat: If you want stripped-down demos of mostly unreleased material, make sure you get the most complete version of these demos since a lot of collections include only a portion of the batch. Some are much more ""full-band"" than others. Brain Tap Shuffle, Come Back Baby, Yellow Peril, Let George Do It, and a number of others would not have been out of place on Can't Buy A Thrill. Also, Fagen does not sing lead on all of these songs - some studio ringers take a number of lead vocals. I happen to like the early harmonization of Fagen and Becker which has never really occurred since. (Of course, I am one of those oddballs that loves Becker's voice and solo CD 11 Tracks of Whack)."
4,"Over all, the best one I tried","I have been using Sonic My DVD sence the first DVD I made, it was V3.0 back then and it came with my brand new hp PC ""Top line in 2002 for $2500""I got to say I tried to switch many times because of the small buges it has, but every thime I try a new soft ware, I come running back to Sonic, as bad as the bugs it has, It is the easest one to auther A DVD, the rest were to hard to figer.sence then I moved from 3.0 to 3.5 to 4.0, they all have small bugs, but not hard to figer, now I will try V6.0, we will see.It is very important for they buyer to know, My DVD is Great to Auther DVD ""Make movie DVD's"" but for making any other format of DVD, it comes with a nother software called ""burn it now"" IT IS A VERY BAD SOFTWARE, so for Data, music or photos, get a nother program."
3,too small to read,I could not believe that a book with such obviousinterest to many would be printed in the form it was.The print is so small in the cartoons that have beenreproduced that one needs a magnifying glass to read.And I am not exagerrating. I would rate this bookas a 5 if it were not published with such unreadable print.
3,Artist only please????,I liked this book in the sense that it was a Mad sampler. I got to see art by old friends (I have been into Mad since the early 1970s) but I don't know if a novice researcher would find this book as good. There are short biographical sketches of all involved.The best history of Mad was The Mad World Of Bill Gaines which is sadly out of print for decades now.Also while I know that the title is Mad Art this book lacks for not talking of the writers of Mad.
3,Not What I Expected,"Little Town of Bethlehem was an interesting movie on the lives of three very different men all struggling to see the same thing come about - peace in their lifetime - only in a non-violent way.Several times during the movie I felt their situation was hopeless. They were up against so much and no one would listen to them. It left me feeling as if peace in a non-violent way will never happen. I was expecting to feel hope. I only felt despair for their situations.I watched this movie with a friend and we discussed it afterwards. One thing we both agreed on was that we felt like it had never got started. It was as if through the entire movie you are waiting for something to happen, but it never does. I have to say I was very disappointed.That said, if you want to hear about what life is really like in the Middle East, you should watch this movie."
2,Deceptive title,"Beware: This book does not focus on xeriscaping. It covers, primarily, general gardening principles and processes."
4,it is short and cheap,"This scope is for my SKS. I got this one because it is short with some power and cheap. It is short enough that I don't need a brass deflector and still be able to use stripper clips. This scope is shorter than most 4x scopes. I would of like a 9x power scope, but they are ether too long or cost to much for my budget. It is not a great scope, but a good short scope with some power."
4,"Good price, limited applications perhaps","I use these scopes for our Tactical Laser Tag sniper rifles because I can set the zoom to just 2X making it easier for kids to find their targets on a small battlefield. Then, with older teens or adults on a larger battlefield they can zoom up to 6 for more of a sniper feel. The tube is very narrow and more difficult to see through than your typical 3-9X, making it important to keep your eye in the right spot while aiming. Once a player gets used to it they love it. The scopes stay sighted in well for the abuse that our guns take. The only significant negative is that without an illuminated reticle they are very difficult to use in the dark. However, illuminated scopes are generally much more expensive and get torn up easier. These are good for the price and my application ([...]). Don't forget to get the rings to attach to your rail."
5,excellent for the price!,Very nice and compact for my Ruger 10/22 takedown rifle. 2x is good for CQC and my near-sightness. 6x is good for shooting small games. Lens is clear.
4,Deer Sluggin' Sight,"After searching for a not so bulky scope for my 12 gauge Home Defender, Amazon surprised me with this NcStar item. It was just the scope for my slugger. It was the perfect optic vision for the effective distance of my gun without the high dollar black hole left on the wallet. Nice, low and compact to make the scatter/slugger gun look and feel unobtrusive while in the field on the hunt."
4,good little scope for the price,"The objective is a little small but there is no misrepresentation here,it plainly states that.It has clear optics and is a sturdy scope.I have this mounted to a .22 it also worked good on my sks.not bad quality for the price."
2,NOT WORTH IT,"At first glance this may seem like quite a find. A book on nuclear war outcomes from the pages of classified documents? Wonderful! Then I began reading. Here's what I learned.1. Nuclear war will be incredibly destructive.2. It would be unwinnable.3. Essential public services we take for granted may not exist or be functional after the war.If you don't know this already you probably live in a cave and can't read anyway.This is also one of the shortest works in print. One can read it in a day, or an afternoon, or....on lunch break. It is about 100 pages large print and many of the pages are taken up with photographs. The author also fills much of the rest with a discussion of the September 11 attacks.The writer deserves one star for using formerly classified documents in any case. Incredibly, he states some of the material has been reclassified! But most readers would do well to ignore these 'scenarios'. There is not enough here. It is not worth it."
1,Quite a disappointment,"This book was hyped in a number of magazines and newspapers that I read. The reviewers seemed to be quite impressed with the book, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.The book was not impressive. What's in here, you've seen before on numerous History Channel shows and read before in many a book. Many will die, many more will be injured, transportation an industry will grind to a halt, and there will be food shortages. Is anyone unaware of this?There were very few technical details, which is really why I bought the book. If that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere."
3,Add this to your Nuclear Library,"The National Archives has withdrawn/reclassified the DOD Emergency Plans Book used to write this book. That fact alone makes this book a must read. I was very excited to start this book but have to agree with the others its a little thin. The author or a subject matter expert probably could have added more information and rounded it out nicely. The introduction is excellent and a good chronology of recent COG events. The actual document was very dry. Reading this reminded me of another book I read, Dropshot The American Plan for WWIII. Only facts and little elaboration. For someone from the Nuclear/COG/Command and Control world this is probably a little basic but some from the outside I would have to say this is must have book but you can put it on your wish list for Christmas."
2,Okay but disappointing,"I'm some what of a fan of Star Gate & I thought buying the cartoon episodes might be fun. They're okay, but they are very different from the movie and television series. Sadly, the challenges the heroes run up against are never really dealt with & just continue on at the end of the series. At the end of the final episode the attitude was that solving the problems so they could return to Earth wasn't important, but continuing their adventure was."
2,get it for the kids,"this is for the kids not bad but really does not explain stargagte much for the real stargate fans, kids will love it though"
3,Not what I expected.,It was a let down from the other Stargate releases. The original movie and series can never be beating. So is life.
2,only for chldren,its to much for children not for adults iwould not recomend this kind of series and would its a lost of time to look at it
2,Interesting at least.,So this is only for die hard stargate fans. Casual fans of the series probably couldnt stand 5 minutes of this incredibly cheesy and incredibly over the top show.
5,EXCELLENT!,We love all things Stargate! Excellent! Wonderful! Very different from the television series of SG-1 and Atlantis - but still innovative and interesting.
1,Don't buy this,"I was excited to hear there was another series of the Stargate franchise. I was equally disappointed to discover how horribly this series was put together. Even one episode was painful to watch. Also, it has no closed captioning or subtitles. Don't buy this series."
1,Just not the same as the real thing,Just doesn't compare to either stargate series that was on t.v. Cheesy doesn't even began to describe this animated show! I wish it was more of a continuation like the star trek animated series was for star trek. Oh well just keep in mind it has nothing on the original stargate or Atlantis.
2,Not like the SG-1 TV show,As a fan of the TV show for the last 10 years I thought this would be related somehow. It isn't at all. As an adult I could barely watch the first 2 episodes -- then I put the box back on the shelf never to open again.
1,Stargate Infinity,unless you want this to complete a stargate collection or you have young kids don't waste your money.
2,Definitely for young children!,"As a big Stargate fan I just saw the title and ordered'er up! Well, that was a mistake - I am an adult and this is basically cartoons for children. The episodes are fine...just not what I was wanting."
4,Why Not?,"Great episodes! Interesting concept worth the investment if you are a big fan. If you are new I would suggest start from the beginning with the movie and tv show. However, its interesting enough that the kids will watch it though they have no idea whats going on story wise."
2,star gate infinity,this is a cartoon it is okay to watch keeps you intrigued to see what happens next but to me wqasnt worth what i paid
2,Stargate Infinity: The Complete Series,"Stargate Infinity: The Complete SeriesThis is not the movie I thought it was, therefore I was disappointed when I tried to watch the DVD. However I am sure there are consumers that would have enjoyed the DVD."
5,Riches for Everyone,"I'm probably the ultimate cynic, but I keep this book next to my bed and read it every night. I was completely amazed at the prosperity that the meditations and exercises brought into my life, not just financially, but spiritually as well. I insist that every one read this phenomenal book!"
5,It's already working after a few chapters!,"I am only a few chapters into this book and already have noticed the Dynamics of Prosperity working. There truly IS golddust in the air. You just have to believe and approach it with an open mind. It's basic enough that you can review the information in your head whether you're in the car or in the shower. Other books that I can recommend as well are The Wisdowm of Florence Scovel Shinn and The Four Agreements. Like another reviewer's opinion, I don't like God preached to me, but you can put whatever God or spirituality in to make it work for you. Just believe and be positive! Good luck!"
5,"I was sick, real sick. This book helped me regain my health","Ever need to rely on an optimisim outside yourself to regain strength, attitude, and health? I had just returned home from the hospital and was contemplating a serious surgery. This book helped me regain my health without surgery!"
1,Simplistic piffle,"I bought this book after my pastor recommended it. I gave up after the first 3 chapters. It's just too hard to believe. Basically, all of her examples sound like this: I was dying of cancer and needed $20,000 for the life saving operation. I had no idea how I was going to get it. However, a billionaire decided that he didn't need $20,000 one day and disposed of the sum by dropping it out the window of his plane. The money landed in my front yard and here I am!*groan*In Ponder's world you never have to lift a finger. Whatever you need (money, clothes, furniture, medicine), it's all magically dropped into your lap at the 11th hour.Get Wallace Wattles' book The Science of Getting Rich for free in ebook format by doing a search with Yahoo. It's far more plausible."
5,Beyond positive thinking!,Catherine Ponder's book is not your average positive thinking book. She tells you exactly how to constructively reframe your life and thought processes. This book is a must have for anyone looking to live the life he/she is meant to.
5,Stress!,This little book of Poems should only be read in times of stress. The different sections have the ability to make one forget the issues at hand.Loved it! Will recommend it! WIll cherish it! Thank you (P) for sending it my way.
5,W.I.T.C.H.#1:The power of five,I think that this is a very good book.Everybody should have the joy of reading this book!Anybody who reads it will love it.There has to at least be something everybody in every W.I.T.C.H.book.I hope that you buy this book!
2,"An Evil Book, to be sure.","The comic definitley is better than the book. Poorly written, the book focuses on the smaller issues rather than the things that matter, the storyline ought to be for 10-15 year olds (the story being rather complicated, and about five teenage girls), but the style of writing seems to be aiming at much younger readers. Several times during this book, I found myself thinking, 'this could have been worded much differently, for much improvement'. Luckily, I only paid $5 NZ for my copy of the book."
3,The first W.IT.C.H. chapter book!,"I am currently reading the twelvth W.I.T.C.H. book, and I really love this series! This was a nice start to the series. It is not the best in the series, but start with this one, because you need to read them in order, or else you'll get confused!"
2,"Damaged, flimsy, product not what I expected","When I ordered this, I was under the impression that it was a comic book, since several of the pages in the preview were comic strips. I thought that was awesome, since I'm a long-time fan of the comics. I've been wanting to read them again.However, when I got it, not only was it not a comic book, but the book literally fell apart in my hands when I opened it. Several of the pages have already fallen out and I only got it an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed in this product."
4,W.I.T.C.H the power of five book#1,"I think this book should have specified if it was a graphic novel, or an ""actual"" book. I bought it, but it turns out it was the wrong one! I was a little upset, but it actually isn't that bad. The book came in great condition, however my mom was a bit upset that it was wrapped in newspaper. Like I said the book comes in very nice condition. I think it is a very reasonable price for a book too. So, if you're thinking about buying it, feel free to because you won't regret it!"
4,Please Read.,"As the five guardians are discovering their powers, Phobos is gaining power and losing the loyalty of his people. The guardians all have the same wierd dream (well almost). Four of the five have accepted their destiny one does not choose to accept it: Cornelia. I only wish that I could tell you everything about this book but that would just ruin it."
3,[Censorship],"I have to say I've been lucky to read this comic in it's original european-version (yes originally it is a comic, not a novel,I don't understand US decision to turn it to a novel) and I'm so sad to find that the few comic pages kept are censored!! That's why I'm giving it 3 stars. I am actually a fan of the comic book, I don't think it's an anime wannabe (in fact it would be ""manga"" wannabe if you wanted to use the term), of course it's inside the genre of magical girls, but it is NOT a rippoff of anything. If you could see the original story I'm sure everyone at least would give it a chance and of course fall in love with the story and characters."
1,What the Heck is going on here,"W.I.T.C.H is a book about five girls with the powers of the elements. What obviosly you don't know is that WITCH has already been published in several countries in the form of an Anime. The Anime is what I read in the first place and I woud welcome the idea of reading it in English. I did not enjoy the book specificly since it is not the quality that the Anime had. I think it is silly to publish it in book form. I woud buy and recommend the Anime to my friends but the book I would not. Please find a way to pubish the Graphic nove whch is the best Anime I have read .I think it would enjoy suscess in young adults and Older kids, including myself"
1,Not 'Great' At All,"This is really nothing special at all, it is 'wicth' after all, a series that is not at all 'good' in anyway to start with. The cartoons and drawings of the characters are poor, no artistic talent was put into the creation of this series. The books also feature the same poor art work as well, so again nothing special at all. Also one has to think and 'believe' the creators of 'witch' somewhat copied the whole concept otherwise, the girl 'will' looks and is alot like 'Willow' from Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and this will is a poor copy of something that is great, that being Buffy The Vampire Slayer series, which is maybe too much for children, who enjoy cartoons, so for them and for their parents, I would suggest strongly, against this poor talent stuff, and go with something much better, like The Winx Club.~Amy"
3,It was okay...,"I'm twelve, and from my point of view, I think that some of the books in the W.I.T.C.H. series are poorly written. The dialouge isn't good and the characters are a little hard to relate to. All in all, it's a good book."
2,Not A Very Sophisticated Read,"In this first book of the series we're introduced to Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia and Hay Lin (W.I.T.C.H) at the beginning of their friendship. This is a series book for middle readers. The writing level is not as sophisticated (read: challenging and smooth) as I've seen in other books for this target audience. Let's hope the target reader is more savvy than what the plot offers and doesn't buy into some of the mean-spirited activities the girls are engaged in. The story perpetuates some of what is wrong in how we treat each other. Reiterating poor behavior and bad choices for teens who are absorbing what they read is never good. The story isn't written well enough for them to draw out (what we expect) is a positive life lesson. If you can read this with your pre-teen, there's an opportunity to talk about how people treat each other; how it feels/what it would feel like to be the odd person out; how it feels when someone plays tricks on them."
4,something happened...,"Ok, two years ago this series was a WHOLE COMIC BOOK, instead of a chapter book with a few pages of comic. What happened to that?! I loved the comics, but the books BLOW.The books are too easy to read, and the art work is SO beautiful, we need more of it. The artwork is so good, I can see myself as a charecter in this series. The charecters kinda bug me too. Cornelia is a stupid brat, Will is so cheesy (if we just BELIVE in the heart of candracar, we can save the world!! pshh. Please.), and Taranee...dont get me started. She is a disgrace to all Aries. I am an aries, and I do not bite my nails and shudder all the time. She is a wuss, she needs to GROW UP.I am rating this a four because of the art, the plot, and Irma and Hay lin, the ONLY good charecters in the story. It would be a five,but It will only be a five when the comics are printed again, instead of these lame books."
1,Please give me the Anime,"I really love Witch, the Anime, which I discovered in France 2 years ago. It's about four girls who have the power to control the elements and protect the earth from a growing menace. Unfortunatly when I dscovered it was published here I found it to be a book, not a comic. It was also written in a format destined for younger children instead of teenagers. I am bitterly disapionted since alot of my friends wanted to read it. The Anime is the best one I have ever read and turning it into a book takes out all of the beauty and Magic. Please do not buy the book until the Anime is published.It is a thousand tmes better"
4,Fan From MA,"Kiss continues its Alive tradition with Alive III. However, the energy is just not the same without the orignial live lineup. Ace and Peter add to the live effect of the concerts, in a personal opinion, Eric and Bruce are too good, and the live album is flawless; like a studio album with crowd in the backround. Overall a great album though"
4,"A great live album, filled with rockin' guitars","This album is a strangely underrated one, always being compared with the legendary ""ALIVE"" (and always unfavorably). I listened ""ALIVE III"" before ever having heard the ""original"" one (the one without the roman numerals), and I thought it was great. Hard-hitting rock n' roll, a lot of good (pop!) melodies, and a lot of very unsofisticated, but also very effective, guitar work. So if you're into traditional, timeless rock music, hard but not really metal, this is definately a good choice. The sound is very good for a live album (the crowd is a bit noisy, maybe), and this is truly KISS at their best."
5,alive 3,I'm not one of these old fogies who was a teenager back in the 70's. I didn't see KISS live until I was in 6th grade and they came to town on the Animalize tour. I have all of their albums. This is the lineup I like best. Bruce and Eric play circles around Ace & Peter and it shows up in this performance. The production on Alive 1&2 sucked. This shows a tighter sounding and more talented KISS than that of the 70's. Nice selection of songs as well. Go ahead and keep the first 2 ALives.
3,Passable (barely) 3rd live album from KISS.,"This is the first live release from KISS in 16 years and the big question is, ""Was it worth the wait?"". The answer is...sort of. Alive III covers all of the 80's hits and throws in a few of the classics from the 70's to boot. My only complaint is why on earth did they include a version of The Star Spangled Banner? After 20 years and 26 albums, couldn't they have found a better song to include in the new package? This version of Deuce is better than the one on Alive!. I Still Love You is another standout. Though I'm usually not a fan of live albums, Alive III contains a lot of good versions of the songs. The album opener, Creatures of The Night, is fantastic; Heaven's On Fire, Watchin' You, I Was Made For Lovin' You, I Love It Loud, and Forever are all respectable renditions of the originals. However the live versions of Unholy and Domino are bloody awful. The rest of the album is just what it is...live songs rehashed to make a buck!"
1,"This is KISS waste by-product, or more simply garbage.","This is simply the worst kiss album ever made a total waste of or lack of effort. Kiss in the 80's stunk badly. This is live bad material, bad songwriting, and even worst, terrible musicianship. Let's face it Kiss was never suppose to last for 30 years. Please people let this band die already. For god sake I think the last time I bought a Kiss album was in 1980 and I was 16 years old. I think I'd rather revive the Bee Gee's one last time than listen to this crap. Save your allowance kid's and buy a good gangsta rap cd instead. C. M. Louisville Ky. 8-1999"
4,Good LIVE album,"The first 2 KISS live albums, ""Alive!"", and ""Alive II"" are excellent live albums from the make-up KISS. Even though this album has good live sound it doesn't have that same energy of the KISS with the original members. On top of all that it sounds great."
2,"Thongs, Tights, Under the Lights","""When we play this song the whole place lights up like a Christmas Tree"" screams Paul Stanley. This lightweight live album only receives 2 stars for being funny. If you played Kiss Alive and then this one right after, your only response would be to laugh out loud. This doesn't even sound like a good cover band of Kiss. What Happened????? They traded their makeup for the tights and jungle suits. If you listen real close you can hear the girls screaming- ""Put your makeup back on !!!!"""
4,Great mix of the old and the new,"KISS definitely gets back to the music the old fans remember. Not a lot of the weak stuff found in the mid-eighties. Strong start with ""Creatures of the Night"", and only gets better. All I can say is, ""Thank God"", after all these years, the real KISS is back."
3,I post 3 stars (nuetral),"Because I have a copy of the Kissology 3 Concert that this was taken off of and the DVD sounds weaker in volume on the DVD than on the Compact Disc, is this a foul up with the audio in the arena in Auburn Hills Detroit Michegan or was there something wrong with the microphones on the night they recorded that particular concert? The vocals are toned down on most if not all of the songs because the actual music is louder than the vocals. I was listening to Domino off of this and you can hardly hear Gene's voice, what's the dealeo?"
3,A Mixed Blessing,"So now we come to the final chapter in the ALIVE trilogy.It was inevitable that Paul and Gene would bow to public pressure and put out another live album.They hoped to produce a set that would have rivalled ALIVE 1 & 2; unfortunately,number three did not make the grade.I can't see the sense in repeating songs that had already appeared in previous live incarnations(DEUCE,ROCK N'ROLL ALL NITE,WATCHIN'YOU,DETROIT ROCK CITY).They had the albums from DYNASTY to REVENGE to choose material from.Why no FITS LIKE A GLOVE,TURN ON THE NIGHT,or TEARS ARE FALLING?!Also the Eddie Kramer production on some of the tracks sounds watered down, almost to UNMASKED like proportions.Saying that though,on other tracks the Kulick/Stanley/Simmons/Singer lineup really bared it's fangs and showed how good they really were(CREATURES OF THE NIGHT ,I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU,LICK IT UP,FOREVER).By all means,buy ALIVE 3;just don't think it will be better than 1&2,and you won't be dissapointed."
3,Good Sound - Poor Packaging and Selection,"The problem with this album is that it tried to cover lots of material on a single disc. By the time this was recorded KISS had enough 80's and 90's material to have a double CD of all the songs that made them popular again in the mid 80's. Its true that the songs here sound good and fresh but a follow up of Alive and Alive II could have been a lot more original with better song selection and far better packaging. If you are looking for a ""classic"" live album sitck to Alive. Let's just hope they do better on Alive IV."
1,Waste of time and trees,"This is the first conspiracy book that I have purchased. All I can say is what a waste of money.The book did not interest me whatsoever. I never got past the first couple chapters. It was written in a format that did not make sence to me at all.Reading the reviews, if you are a die hard conspiracy buff, I guess this is the book for you. If you are looking for something different to read at night or on the airplane, get something else."
1,Fiction writting,Anyone can say or write anything this book is highly fictional. No real facts are mentioned in this book but mostly hearsay.
2,Not for beginners,"This book is full to the top with interesting information, especially about hidden connections between various conspiracy theories. I had a strongly mixed reaction to the book. Whenever he was talking about a theory I knew about prior to reading the book, he seemed lucid, fluent and knowledgeable. Whenever he talked about a theory I had never seen before, I found him confusing and oblique. Moreover, the format ofthe book, which had seemed so useful when we were on familiar ground, suddenly became an obstacle to understanding.My advice: if you already know a lot about conspiracy theories and are looking for a good reference guide, buy this book. If you are familiar with many conspiracy theories and are looking for a book which will tease out the connections between them, buy this book. But if you are just getting started learning about conspiracies, or if you are feeling mildly curious, start somewhere else."
4,What Fun! Conspiracy Buffs...This Is A Must...,"Turn to any page! Wow,if only 10% of the conspiracy Theories are factual...Worth reading. Makes one think.Many links.Theories you would never have imagined.The author has compiled some great data/information worth reading.Some humorous and some very serious....Give this book a read!"
4,"Not the definative ""be all to end all"", but worth having","I purchased this book almost a year ago. The format is difficult to follow, but it is full of very good info; some of it new to me. I wouldn't think of it as the only conspiracy book you will ever need, but it is useful as a starting point to investigate almost every area in the vast conspiracy universe. I finished the book with twenty or thirty names and events that I want to investigate further. I think that this book would make a great third or fourth conspiacy book for the novice to read. I'm sure it will lead to reading a dozen or more, more detailed books, at least it has for me."
1,Poorly Written,"I enjoy conspiracy theory books. I have a modest, but comprehensive library on the subject. This is the only member of the collection I wish I could un-own.I found it to be poorly organized and lacking of any depth on virtually every subject it touched on.Were it not for the deep respect I have for the written word, this book would line my birdcage."
5,LA BIBLIA DE LOS BEATLES!,"Este es el libro que todo fan de los beatles que faltaba. Este ofrece la posibilidad conocer la verdadera historia, aclarar dudas, conocer anecdotas ineditas y lo mejor: contada por ellos mismos.Sin embargo, lo mas destacable es que en este libro no aprecia la dominancia comercial ni el liderazgo forzado de McCartney, a diferencia de los otros relatos. Sin duda un gran documento, excelentes fotos e imagenes ineditas. El libro que todo verdadero fan de los beatles deberia tener..."
1,Inaccurate and disappointing,"I'm an avid Smurf collector, but I found this book to be inaccurate regarding prices, as well as identification of particular Smurf figurines. The Smurfs pictured were in terrible condition(missing parts, chipped paint), and the book does not have a comprehensive listing or illustration of all of the Smurfs available. The next book about Smurfs by this author does have far more pictures of Smurf figurines, but the identifications under the pictures are confusing and hard to read. Additionally, the pictures of the individual figurines are tiny, almost too small to be useful for a quick reference. At least the figurines pictured are in better condition than the ones in the first book."
1,Why Write A Book on Smurfs when YOu don't know Smurfs,"I am an avid collector and I started when I was very young. For insurance purposes I decided to buy a price guide.I know more about smurf collectables than the lady that wrote this guide. Who cares about the smurfs that are worth $7. Obviously that is not why I spent the money for this book.What about the rare smurfs? Most of the smurf stuff in this book were non mint yardsale finds. As popular and easy to find ""Smurfette w/ Tennis"" you think she would have shown one that didn't have the tennis racquet broke off. I have seen better pictures and price analysis by crusing ebay than in this guide.This person was obviously not a smurf collector....just someone making a quick buck putting out a book to trick serious collector's into purchasing it."
1,Inexcusable and insulting,"The 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry was, of course, a real regiment with a proud and well-documented history. Raised in Philadelphia, the 6th Pennsylvania, also known as Rush's Lancers, was led by a ""who's who"" of Philadelphia society. The first colonel, Richard Henry Rush, was the great-grandson of Founding Father Dr. Benjamin Rush, and was also a member of the legendary West Point Class of 1846. Maj. Robert Morris, Jr., who succedded Rush, was the great-grandson of the financier of the American Revolution.These men fought long and hard and took heavy casualties. They earned a reputation as one of the elite cavalry regiments of the American Civil War.This book, although well-intentioned, insults the memory of these men and their proud legacy. It's inexcusable and it's inappropriate. Don't condone that conduct by advocating the promulgation of more of this kind of garbage."
5,Perfect,Ordered this to replace one I had lost. It was a very sentimental key chain... as funny as that is. It was just as I expected.
3,cute but bulky!,"I like this keychain, I thought it would be a complimenting addition to my car decal, however it's a little bigger and bulkier than I anticipated it would be!!!"
4,Fun object,"I wanted an easy to find key chain, and this surely is that. I like the shape, the color, and the idea of it. The only down side is that it's heavier than might be convenient, but that's just a personal perspective. Fun for grown up ladies as well as girls."
5,Sturdy Keychain,Durable and sturdy keychain. Also has great detail. If you're a supergirl or superwomen like me you'll love it!
5,A must have!,"I was getting real flustered, when someone suggested Sonar4 Power.What a tool! I can't imagine how much time and agony it's saved me."
5,Very useful,"The book provided with the software can give you a hard time if you don't have experience with midi and computer recording technology.That's where Sonar 4 Power offers help.If you are a beginner, this is the book for you."
3,Good Manual for sonar 4,I would have liked to have more exercises in what you can do with Sonar. Scott did a good job. But; it was Typical of a textbook.
5,This is the most intelligent dance music you will ever hear.,I have looked for a long time for a CD that provides nice melodies with good arrangement. This CD offers both. All the tracks have been very carefully crafted and it shows. I think this CD is worth the import price because it is something you simply will not find coming from American artists. It is very innovative and I highly recommend it.
4,cameosis,"cameo was one of the best bands back in the day especially when they where a 8 piece unit. i like word up and back and forth but the earlier material is my favorite like i just want to be, my only problem with this cd is two of my favorites are not on it and that's we're going out tonight and it' serious, other than that its worth the buy."
4,Word Up...and so much more!,"A band that deserves more credit for getting people to appreciate the power of Funk, Cameo made some great records. From ""Word Up"", one of the best radio songs ever, to ""Talkin' Out The Side of your Neck"" this CD covers most of the bands highlights. Except for an odd version of She's Strange (the 12"" Rap Version? Another reviewer nailed this one) this is a great collection for anyone who wants some exposure to Funk with a capital F."
5,Classic Funk,"Cameo Arguably was the best R&b Band of the 80's. they started out in the 70's with a Band as large as george clinton's P-Funk Unit and also Maurice White's Earth,Wind and fire's unit as well. Cameo's brand of Music making was versatile in the Hybrid of EWF,Parliament,Ohio Players and other acts. but Cameo was able ot adapt to the changes in the Music game as well. they went from the Horns and full band and shorten there band into a more Electro funk Vibe unit that worked very well in the 80's, in truth what other Funk Outfit from the 70's could go from battling with Earth,Wind and fire to the 80's up against Run Dmc?? Cameo was able to battle in both worlds and Era's and not lose there Base. this compilation showcases there Funk Jams and also there Smooth Slow Jams. Cameo had a Formula for bringing the Grooves and not missing a beat."
5,cajun blue import rod bernard,"this is one of his best cd.it has all of his hit song on it.with his hit song ,this should go on forever.and many more."
2,"Not really ""side loading.""","I bought these cages because I have a smaller frame bike and have had difficulty getting my bottles in and out of their cages. To call the Elite Ciussi Side Cage ""side loading"" is a misnomer. Yes, there is an opening on the side, but the opening is so small that I have to cram the bottle in with more force than is safe to do while riding. I've conceded to top-loading the bottles, which is still difficult, but easier than side-loading, by comparison. The fit is so tight that I have to toggle the bottle to remove it. For the price, I would have expected something much more refined. I'd return them if they weren't already an exchange. My cheap LBS cages do a better job."
5,The best CD of the year from Italy,"I found Come una goccia d'acqua to be the best CD I have heard in a long time: every cut is good, many are exceptional. She reminds me somewhat of a very young Carol King if she had done Tapestry in Italian and with an edge. She has a very sweet voice, though, and you would never guess that is what she is saying if you did not know some Italian. All of the words are included in the notes and her phrasing is not difficult to follow. The arangements are spare for the most part which is not always the case in Italian pop. That is great because her voice is beautiful. I would rate this CD along with Verde, Rosso e Blu by Irene Grandi as the two finest I have heard from Italy in the last two years. Women singers definitely rule, I think, in Italian pop."
1,The Only Book I Have Ever Returned To Amazon,"The premise of this book sounds great but it just does not live up to expectations. The majority of the book is comprised of organizational forms that are simplistic and could easily be done yourself with a few minutes on a word procdessor or spreadsheet, and done much more conveniently and with more depth and flexibility on any of the various homeschool organizational software programs that are available. There are a few helpful articles in the book, but they are too few to warrant the price."
3,It's okay but not super,It definitely has some things in it that are helpful but I was disappointed that it appears to be photocopied. I feel it useful just not overly exciting. I'm planning on using it for next years homeschool period and have looked through it but have not used it as of yet. I think it does have a great checklist for things your children need to know at certain stages. Remember to use it loosely though because that's what homeschooling is all about.
2,Eh...,"Some helpful forms, but quite honestly there was nothing in there I couldn't have either come up with on my own, or found for free online."
2,Not what I expected,"Book is useful for a few of the templates you can copy. Otherwise, it's full of a LOT of reading, just to try to get organized... Not at all what I expected."
4,This includes nearly every form you would ever need,"From unit studies to state requirements, this planner has it all. All of the forms are very easy to use, and can be adapted easily to customize them to your family and student's needs."
1,his5lambsofGod,"THANK YOU for saving me from making a bad purchase. Your comments kept me from buying this organizer, as many put it, in haste. I tend to buy things and never use them and this might have been added to that pile, so, again, thank you for taking the time to post your comments."
3,Very worth considering!,"I've heard a liquid audio sampler of the album and it blows my mind how similar Julian's voice is to that of his father's. He got one track on there, which you could easily sell as an unrealeased song of the early Beatles from the HELP era... The songs sound well produced and tuned; the album is, I believe, slated for release on 23 Feb. 99"
3,A Must For Kim Fans,"Here's the skinny on the video-- it contains a ton of videos and some footage rarely or never seen on on BET or MTV, I bought it as a gift for a friend and we had a blast watching it. If you're someone who ""Gets"" what Kim is about this is a worthy addition to your collection. It's not particularly revealing, and while kim is a major visual artist in her own right theres is nothing groundbreaking here... Fun but not spectacular. TJR"
3,Good low budget movie,"I make it short as usual.Got that movie coz of Sigourney Weaver as I usually like her movies.The first thing what comes in mind when the movie starts, that it has low quality. I guess the director used his home video camera!!! The video quality is poor. It has the quality of an ""adult movie"" :-)I am amazed that great actors such as Weaver, Bebe Neuwirth and Ritter among some others non main casts, were participating in this movie.It really has p..rn quality. And I dont know if they were aware of it when doing this movie.If not those actors would be in the movie, I would have turned off the movie right away due to thinking of that kind of movie as mentioned above.That is quite disappointing about this movie, the ""look like a bad video quality and thinking of an adult movie"""
3,Good but overrated,"A combination of ""The Graduate"" and ""Rushmore"" among other movies.This film is well-made and acted but doesn't really live up to the hype that I read in the press. There didn't seem to be enough substance to it - it was only 80 min long! I left the theatre thinking there could have been many other scenes added but they were probably edited out. There should have been a slow, steady build-up of tension.Still, pretty enjoyable. I thought Bebe Neuwirth was the stand-out."
2,TADPOLE IS NO IGBY,"TADPOLE is a nick-name for 15 year-old Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford), who pines incessantly for his stepmother (Sigourny Weaver).Over Thanksgiving break, Oscar comes to Manhatten, drinks heavily, and ends up in bed with his stepmom's best friend Diane (a scene stealing Bebe Neuwirth). Oscar takes up a lot of the remaining film trying to convince Diane not to tell his stepmom.Tadpole's main problem is Aaron Stanford, who not only looks too old to be a high school sophomore but plays Oscar as very gay while still trying to be a ladies' man. Gender confusion might be a worthy subject for a black comedy, but that's not the issue here.Too bad Tadpole didn't run into Igby, another pretentious spoiled but charmingly demented teen in Manhatten on school break. He could learn a few things. Disappointing."
3,Something to watch on a Sunday afternoon.,"There are a lot of things to like about this movie. The acting is excellent. The script is well written and there are more than a few laugh-out-loud funny scenes in it.The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because I feel it never really ""moved"" me. After watching it, I felt as though I had watched a good movie, but nothing about it is really original or mind blowing. It's just a small quirky movie, and at only 77 minutes I was disappointed with the abrumpt ending.Having said that, Tadpole is certainly worth seeing and is 100 times better than most of the ""Blockbusters"" that go on to gross hundreds of millions."
2,cultural decay: lack of morals or manners but plenty of culture,For me it was kind of sick with two 40 year oldwomen making over a dopey 14 year old.They all deserve a good talking to abouttheir morals and manners?Just a very ugly attempt at humor or coming of age.I pretty much hated it.
3,Cute,"A cute, though ultimately flawed, film. Excellent performances from the luminous Sigourney Weaver (who never seems to age!), the hysterical John Ritter (RIP), and the SEXY Bebe Neuwirth (who has yet to disappoint me in any of her work). The story is a little weird, a boy with a crush on his step mom, and yet completely believable. In Oscar, Aaron Grubman has found a quirky character that any precocious teenage male (such as myself) can relate to."
5,Full of Biting and Sardonic Wit,This was a beautifully shot film with an excellent script. The acting was wonderful and in particular Neuwerth stood out. The wit was biting and terrifically amusing. An excellent film.
3,The oddest thing...,"I was browsing for movies in Netflix, and I came across a German film called ""Hilife"", released 3 years before the hardcover edition of this book, with the same plot, and a female main character named Emma. Coincidence? Hmmmm....."
5,Better Than Homemade!,"Bisquick is the best baking mix on the market, and provides a good start for pancakes and crepes. I like the 7.5 ounce units because you don't end up with extra batter. This size is perfect for our family of 3.Depending on what kind of consistency you prefer, you can add more or less milk, and another egg to the mix if you like. I like my pancakes more crepe-like but my daughter likes hers to be fluffier. With this mix, I can make hers first, with a heavier batter, and then add more milk to the leftover mix and make my crepes!We actually don't use this mix for biscuits, but just for pancakes and crepes, as we aren't really biscuit eaters.Amazons price is, of course, just right for this product. I feel good just knowing I have a case in my pantry!"
4,Quick Fix for Bisquick Complete Biscuit Mix,1/2 t salt + 1 t vegetable oil (added to water before stirring into dry ingredients). Bake as normal. You're welcome!
4,great way to cook,"The fryer works great - temperature settings, controls, speed of heating. Magnetic power attachment a nice touch. Capacity is kind of low, but for the price, it's a good deal. The removable frying pot is great for clean up. Outer plastic really does stay cool. The old stainless fryers could burn you on contact. The oil does tend to splatter beyond the inner bowl onto the heating element, so odor is a small problem. Other than that, great value. Nothing like home made french fries!"
4,BFLO Wings and things,"My Boyfriend loves this fryer, He is from Buffalo and craves traditional wings like those made in Buffalo NY. He uses this at least once a week. It is perfect for making small batches of fried goodies.I love the fact that it keeps him from distroying my kitchen when he makes fried foods. It never splatters beyond the unit itself. Great fryer for small batches or when one person likes fried food and the other dosen't."
4,great fryer,I only gave it 4 stars because it is so big and takes up so much space on my counter. Other than that I love it because no more splatters in my kitchen from frying and it heats nicely and fries to perfection.. Plus the pan is removeable for washing. (Love this feature the most) No more worry about getting the electrical components wet when trying to wash it! because there are none on the removeable pot..
1,The Vortex: A true story of Passion and Karma,"This book went on and on and on...and finally when I hit the last page, I was let down. I just could not figure out what the point of this story was? I expected some tying up of loose ends..but nothing. A tale of passion no doubt, a string of sexual encounters, a pursuit of various women, and a psychic or two thrown into the story to tell the main character about his past life. Huge disappointment. Very badly written and poorly edited. There are better books that discuss karma and the soul. Save your money."
5,"One Sweet Series, at a good price too","This series realy should be on the best-seller list, too bad it is so old. It still is well writen, and exciting. Get this, along with the 4,5,6 book, the 7,8,9 books, and 10, 11, and 12 singles. The sentenals are OK, but only because the origonal charecters are in it. I LOVE MS. HAYES"
3,Excellent Adaptation,"Very much a blow by blow of the TV series, this book does add 'some' background to the characters and the story of Robotech. Worth buying."
4,Billy Bobs Supper Review,"I think Battle Cry is a very good book one of the better in the Robotech series. Even though it is very slow at the begining but once you get past the first couple chapters it begins to flow very good. I think this book is for a more mature audience because of its adult content and the occasional curse. Still Battle Cry has alot of action and is very enjoyable to read and explains alot from the first book. I think anyone who likes action, adventure would like this book. And anyone who enjoys science fiction would enjoy it. In all I think this is a very good book(for the mature audience)."
4,nice price,"A nice compilation of the greatly enjoyable Ben's [Benjor] hits from yester years, but beware-this is the same recording sometimes listed as Braziliance!"
2,Vincent Crane - 'Taro Rota' (Voiceprint),"Has been tagged as a Vincent Crane solo effort - but it's noted through other sources to [more or less] be more of an Arthur Brown record. So, who really knows? 'Taro Rota' isn't as bad as I was expecting - as one old school Atomic Rooster fan told me this was a sheer waste of time. Although I do not understand why all three of this CD's tracks are of the same title - possibly a typo? You sure this wasn't reissued on the Cleopatra label? Private joke, there. As for the tunes - #1 ""Taro Rota"" (22:30) is best described as low-key progressive, #2 ""Taro Rota"" (3:21) is a reworking of the Rooster's ""Tomorrow Night"" and #3 ""Taro Rota"" (22:29) is quite similar to track number one. This little-known 1976 Vincent Crane recording got it's name from Crane's widow - Jeanie - while dabbling in Tarot cards. Okay! Pretty much aimed toward the absolute completists and die-hard fans."
4,Creative Reading,"This is a wonderful book that poses some basic, but rarely asked questions: Why do some works travel through time while others can't? Why is the activity of creating literature not an effort to communicate but an effort to 'get it right'?"
3,Liked it,"""Entre las Piernas"" is actually a murder mystery movie. It is also a movie about flawed characters. Victorial Abril plays a woman who is a sex addict. At a sex addict's meeting she meets Javier Bardem's character and they start an affair. Her husband starts to suspect and harasses Bardem's character. He also tries to pin a murder on him. I liked it. I recommend it. Victoria Abril and Bardem do a phenomenal job with this movie. I think a better job could have been done editing the movie and it turns confusing at times. The acting is definitely better than the movie itself which loses its integrity because it tries to fit too many things in it. The film just tries to do too much and it confuses the viewer and goes into too many tangents."
3,Good Thriller,"This is a good thriller that will start slow but then it slowly gets you wondering about what's going on. However, sometimes it is hard to follow, maybe because of the subtitles and the ending just seems a bit clumsy as if the director just got bored and wanted to finish it.Overall a good movie to watch."
2,Disappointing,"The book is an honest, yet slow account of travel into PNG's interior. The climactic episode allows for some excitement, but the author's confusing sense of guilt is ridiculous and tiring."
2,You need more than two weeks to find a lost tribe.,"The Lost Tribe is an account of a journalists short (2 week) trip into one of Papua New Guinea's more remote areas. The book is descriptively well written, but is also full of inaccuracies caused by the authors lack of knowlege of local languages and of modern Papua New Guinea. The people he descibes may well be highly isolated but as with most of PNG, their names are included in the common role. Had he given imself more time he could have obatined proper maps which reveal the location of the village and the fictitious volcano he descibes. He could also have learnt Pidgin properly which would have been useful in getting himeself out of the situation that arose. What the author doesn't know is that after his departure from Wanakepa those villagers were forced to pay huge compensation for what happened. They would like the author to bare some of the cost. I'm sure this could be arranged through MAF whoom he can contact through the internet."
3,There are no emus in New Guinea,"I am no native English speaker, but I spent some time in New Guinea. And I know that there are no emus in New Guinea, but cassowaries. Apart from that, a rather good account of contemporary New Guinea, although too superficial for my taste."
4,Extreme Beauty,"One of last decade's most intriguing bands,Ultrasound imploded after only one álbum and an EP but left behind a marked willingness to push the envelope and expand the concept of song structure while rarely giving up on their exquisite melodic instincts.Consequently we have side by side noisy progressions(""Cross my Heart"") and perfect pop songs(""Aire&Calder;""),power chord rockers to match Suede(""Fame Thing"") and what's possibly the most abrasive song ever committed to tape(the 40 minute long title track).Extreme yet for the most part tuneful Ultrasound deserve to be remembered and rediscovered."
4,a (beautiful) whirl of distortion,"Ultrasound managed to make a record which is at the same time cacophonous and tuneful. I'll try to make myself clear: I take it for granted that you know my bloody valentine (otherwise you wouldn't have made this far...). Well, their trademark, as you know, are the distorted guitars. Here too they take the lion's share but the songs are considerably longer and they build up slowly (while my bloody valentine plunges you amids the action right from the outset). Besides ""Everything Picture"" isn't as racous and disturbing as MBV, the music is more ""tuneful"", and the overall atmosphere, depite being as noisy, is more psychedelic... This record is likely to leave your ears shredded and (simultaneously) your mind numbed."
4,AN ENJOYABLE DISCOVERY,This violinist was new to me. There is a lot to enjoy in his playing. The first is rock solid intonation. The second is a mature view of these old chestnuts. The performers are not out to prove a point or make a statement; they both violinist and conductor let these delightful concerti just go their own natural way. That is a good description of these performances they just feel right-natural. My own personal favorite is Gil Shaham on DGG; but this recording is a fine alternative. They are very enjoyable.
2,yogo video,Unfortunately I thought that I was ordering a dvd and could not use the video so gave it away to a friend.
2,"Verbose, redundant, shallow. Is this really and an American Classic?","Seriously folks, this book is way too long considering the content. Was Dreiser getting paid by the word? I have never not finished a book but about half way thru book two I would have put it down except I was on a long flight and I had to read something besides the silly flight magazines. With the poor, two dimensional development of personages this book cant hold a candle to Dostoevsky or Trollope. We have much better American authors so why is this an American classic?To be sure, I am no english professor and this is the first and hopefully last book review I will ever write but as a working class reader I can say this was a tough slog to read with no reward. Life is too short for books like this one.Take my advice... Look elsewhere for a good book. Save yourself!"
4,The best team before Benson & Stabler on L&O: SVU,"I recently discovered Cagney and Lacey on the internet so I am probably one of the youngest fans(I'm 27). This was a groundbreaking cop show! Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly were amazing as Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey, respectively. One was tough, the other sympathetic and caring. C&L put the grid on the map for the women's movement and showed real women can do a job just as good as a male cops can while maintaining a professional and personal life. I hope to see the other seasons released on DVD soon but until then I will be catching up on this wonderful show online on hulu.com."
2,This is not the FIRST SEASON!,The first season started with a TV Pilot movie starring Loretta Swit as Cagney. Then 6 episodes with Meg Foster as Cagney. That was the first season. I cancelled my pre-order as soon as I found out these episodes were not available. Sorry! But don't try to sell me a lie! Let me have the pilot and original episodes as shown. Otherwise FORGET ABOUT IT!
4,They're Back!,"I loved this series from the start, but the first season was the weakest because the characters had not yet really come into their own, nor had been fully developed. But watching them again is like seeing old friends, and I marvel at the talent of Ms. Gless and Ms. Daly. Watching season one just gives you a little taste and makes you long for more episodes, even though you know the outcome of what is coming. As the series advanced, the writing got better and better, along with character development. Barney Rosenzweig really knew what he was doing and there will never again be another Cagney and Lacey. Can't wait for season two, at which time I will be yearning for season three!"
5,Fantastic Show,Cagney & Lacey was my favorite show on TV. I am very happy that it is finally coming out on DVD. I have been waiting a long time for this show. If you don't know Cagney & Lacey please buy it. The Show stars two of the Best Actresses television has ever seen. Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly. Watching the shows again was like visiting old friends.
4,Cagney & Lacey Season 1,"Cagney & Lacey is a very well acted & written series, which still holds today. Tyne Daly plays are very real, flawed cop & mother trying to do both jobs well. Sharon Gliss, plays a damaged woman, who is working out her life, as best she can, putting her job before anything else. The balance & friendship between Cagney & Lacey is actedwith believeability & compassion. I highly recommend this series."
4,A little disappointed,"I eagerly opened this set I received today and discovered that the 1st season is a little short. Why would they not include the original episodes with Meg Foster in this supposedly complete first season????? Fans realize there was a cast change, and although Sharon Gless proved to be a great Cagney, I still would have liked to see those earlier episodes. I hope they at least consider releasing them separately. Given how long we had to wait for this release, I think it probably not likely we'll ever see those."
4,MEMORIES,"Even though there were great liberties taken with N.Y.C. Police Departmental Protocol, I enjoyed seeing the 1st season DVD of Cagney and Lacey. I don't know if it was the show itself or the fact that I got to glimpse at NEW YORK CITY.I can't wait for season two !!!!"
5,Insight for travelers,"This is a fine ethnographic study of the Raramuri people, their history and world views. If you plan to travel to the Copper Canyon area, where you will have a chance to interact with the Raramuri, this is a great way to gain an understanding of the people and their culture. I found it easy to read and more interesting than many scholarly works. It includes all of the details important in a good anthropological study."
1,frustrated to the MAX,"I bought this RCT3 soaked because my son loves RCT3 so much. As soon as I installed it, it crashed both the Soaked and the original RCT3. Neither would work again. I was getting 'bad version 4 ' error and asking me to install a disk I already had installed . There is NO customer support for Atari games! No one answers their phone and no one responds to my e-mails. It is trash."
3,Not that good for an expansion pack,"This game isn't that good. The worst thing is that the waterslides don't have enough pieces, passenger types (for example, a single tube), and slide types. But I really like it that you can create tunnels and create underwater paths! The aquarium is not very good at all. It has a crappy amount and variety of fish tanks and pieces. Why couldn't Atari put in escalator paths for the aquariums or add more fish tanks with giant squids or octopuses? The waterfall feature is really cool! Then you can make rollercoasters go through them and get all the peeps soaked from head to toe! Another thing that is bad about this game is if you change the Giant Flume's train car colors, it will just stay the same color all the time! Then you can't make a detailed replica of Canobie Lake Park's Boston Tea Party! Too bad Canobie fans! And one last thing is, get RCT3: Wild expansion pack after you get this, so you can double the RCT3 fun!"
1,This screwed up our computer,This game would be cool... if it ran. i got the game and was all happy loaded it and the thing wouldnt run. i called tech support and the person told me to download a new driver for our graphic card. i did this and installed it on our computer. when this didnt work we tried to uninstall rctycoon 3 soaked and instead it uninstalled rctycoon 3 and i still have the soaked thing that doesnt work on my computer. so DONT GET THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS WITH THE VERY BAD TECH SUPPORT. now i am rctycoonless and i have 30 dollars less in mmy wallet
1,Need another software program,I was not happy when I received this product because you cannot play it alone. You have to buy another software to play it.
2,not bad but not good either,okay it is bad and very poorley done. i got bored after playing it for 2 days. at least its better than the 1st one and the 2nd one. he................he(emabbarssed and shamed of buying this game)*sob*why did i get it???? *sob*
4,Get Wet This Summer!,"I would say this is a pretty good expansion pak; it adds new elements to the theme park and some of the additions gives a theme park countless possibilites. This expansion gets a 5- star fun factor for its creativity and effort. But overall, I will just give it a 4 star because it still has glitches and many has experienced lagging. But when compared to the RCT2's expanisons (time twister and wacky worlds), this one is a winner by far. Just a reminder, there's another expanison coming out in October call Wild!"
2,Warning :Very Hard To Uninstall,"I purchased this expansion pack from a book order and I was so exited. After I started playing with the features, I installed the patch which fixed only a few things. Then, I didn't play the RCT3 because Soaked! was on it. Now I finally got rid of that terrible game. That took some work too-not just any work more like TONS of work. I was exiting for the first few hours but then I wished I hadn't installed it. If you're a person like me-who can't take game errors, DO NOT buy this game. I think Atari needs to clean up there future games."
1,Don't waste your $$,"Like many others, I found that ""Soaked"" is impossible to install if you had previously installed the demo version of RCT3. I'm an expert user, but I can find no way, including editing the registry, using the RCT3 uninstaller, etc. etc.to get the installer to recognize Soaked.... And as others have pointed out, there is no user support available. More likely than not, you will get a 'wrong version 4' error too . and you'll end up returning the software or just dumping it.Don't waste your money.... what poorly written garbage!"
4,Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 expansion pack: soaked!,"This game is easy to use and is enjoyable. Although it is difficult to use at first, but after you go on it more you will find it easy to work."
1,Could not play,Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Soaked adds a new security to check so that the original RCT3 disk is required to play.However after installing and inserting the original RCT3 disk I always got an error message that the wrong disk was installed onmultiple computers. Overall it was a frustrating and disappointing experience.
1,Still bad 30 years later,"I was there dude! I love most prog rock, and back in 1975 I bought this record in its' original vinyl glory! I didn't like it then, but I kept it in my collection. And I've played the record occasionally through the years, trying to find something in it to like, but never have. No melody, no hooks, the vocals are painfully awful and there is no instrumental virtuosity to make up for it.I think the band members (or their mothers) wrote the glowing reviews here. Its a matter of taste, I prefer melody instead of dissonance. This is an ""okay"" album, I'm giving it 1 star to balance the excess praise heaped on it by the other reviewers."
4,great musicianship,"This CD was great. I love the innovation of Gentle Giant's work. I listen as a musician mostly, so appreciating the complexity of the style.Packaging was good and no breakage."
5,These magna are the absolute best!,"You need to get the magna if your a Sailor Moon fan, it is so much better than the TV show!!"
5,This was so cool!!,This was an exclent book. A must have for any old or new Sailor Moon lover. I personally liked this much more than the tv series. And the information abou their past lives was great! And I just can't get enough of those drawing! You have to get this book!!!!!
