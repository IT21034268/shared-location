1,A very boring book.,This is a very boring book. Nothing happened druing the first half of the book and even it started moving the story was flat. The plot was so sketchy that a lot of pages were filled with talks of visiting fast food and main character's love of fast food. This is terrible.
1,disappointing,"This book did not meet my admittedly high expectations. The author overpromised and underdelivered, failing to cover any subject attemptd in depth. After reading a couple of these guides I realized that most of what you need to know to succeed in business school is just common sense. Keep doing whatever you did to be successful before you got to business school and don't listen to so-called pundits, who all give conflicting information anyway."
4,"A quick, fun and informative read!","I read the MBA Jungle, B-School Survival Guide and found it to be an excellent resource. If I was reading this with the eyes of a prospective student, this book would have accurately addressed what I'd need to know. As an administrator/educatior who works with the MBA program at our institution, I can say the information I read was right on target! You did a great job. It was easy and fun to read and I plan to recommend this book to prospective students."
2,Nothing New,"I got turned on to Jungle Media Group through my sister's subscription to JD Jungle magazine. I looked through the MBA Jungle website, and was really excited when I got this book. This book contains little to no new content not offered in the magazine or on the website. Some of the sections are taken directly from the website (probably vice versa actually). It's not to say that the information itself is not useful (although it is presented a little simplistically), but it feels very stale. So if you are a regular reader of MBA jungle or MBAJungle.com save your money."
3,Good book if your school fits the mold,"I found this book interesting, but it seemed to me that it would be most useful to a Harvard/Stanford/etc MBA. I go to a business school that is not a top school, and I found that much of what was said just didn't apply to me. In fact, after reading this book you might be scared away from b-school, even though many schools do not employ the pressure cooker tactics of some of the more prestigious ones. I would recommend reading the book, but remember that little advice can hold true for every program."
2,not worth your time or money,I returned the book after a few days. For a better resource on B-school try ABC for Getting the Admissions Edge.fyi - The reviews for the MBA Jungle book were obviously written by MBA Jungle themselves in my opinion. They sound fake.
3,Needs more Movies,"This so called set of 3 really only had 2 full length movies. Number 3 was simply a documentery on Poirot stories, should have been combined with another movie the way they did for the Orient Express. I have to say though, the two movies in the set are among the best of Poirot."
5,Writing Worth Reading,"This writing (song/book) has a message for all ages in all ages. Although this is suitable for reading by youth and aged alike, as Father's Day approaches, it is apparent how appropo this book is for gifting from father to son/grandson....a message, a lesson, a reminder that the future depends on acceptence of simple truths. Get this book, read this book, share this book. You will be so delighted that you have done so."
2,WHY DOES IT LEAK/,"I BOUGHT THIS QUEEN SIZED RAISED PREMIER AEROBED ABOUT 1-1/2 YRS AGO. IT HAS ONLY BEEN USED INDOORS ABOUT 5 TIMES (AS A GUEST BED)AND IS STORED IN A CLOSET. WHEN I INFLATED IT YESTERDAY IT APPARENTLY HAS A SLOW LEAK AND WOULD HAVE TO BE RE-INFLATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THOUGH IT IS COMFORTABLE, I SURE EXPECTED MORE FROM A $250 BED!!"
2,"Leaks are impossible to find, fix","This bed worked well until it started to leak, after about its tenth use. The design makes it difficult or impossible to find or fix a leak. I would not count on this bed lasting longer than one year. Four stars for function, one star for durability, no stars for fixability."
3,Disappointed,It has two sprung seams...any more and I will be on the floor. I had this product for little over a year. It gave me the best sleep I have had for years. I truly believe it should have lasted longer for the price.
2,Just so you know,"The air release valve is a very poor design and is prone to breakage. When it breaks, the bed is not useable until you replace the valve which will run about $15. Check the Aerobed FAQs for more info."
2,Developed a slow leak after the first few uses,"We thought we'd buy this to use as a guest bed for my inlaws when they visit 5-6 times a year. After the second use, it developed a slow leak, so that they wake up in the morning kinda sunk in the middle. I can't see how we are going to be able to figure out where the leak is. It is still somewhat useable, since you can reinflate it as it goes down and it doesn't leak so much you are on the floor, but for $250, I expected it to be much better.I should have spent the money on a futon instead."
1,very poor quality,"We have guests almost every weekend, so we have need for both single and double inflatable beds. We have purchased at least six single and three double Aerobeds over the last few years. Every one of them (except the last, which is only 3 months old) has developed slow leaks which cannot be found, so cannot be repaired. A guest goes to sleep on a fully inflated mattress, and wakes up in the middle of the night on a hard, or carpeted, floor! The product clearly has a design flaw. They know about it, but can't or won't remedy the problem. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! (We are not sure how we will accommodate our guests in the future, but it's just too expensive to keep buying Aerobeds.)"
5,Ease of pumping up and putting away,"We haven't slept on the bed yet, so I can't rate that. But I was impressed with the ease with which it pumped up. And especially how easy it was to roll up and put away in the bag. I especially liked the mattress cover and dust ruffle. I will probably order another soon, so I will have one for each grandchild when they visit."
1,Good Idea - Terrible Execution,"Used the queen size a number of times and was happy with its comfort. However, it died after less than a year and being used less than 20 times. The middle three cells on the bottom portion formed one large bump right in the middle of the bed. Soon after it sprung a leak. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!"
4,My AeroBed is great.,I needed an extra bed that wouldn't take up much space so when friends stay over they don't have to sleep on the floor. My bed blows up and deflates easy enough and my friends say it is comfortable to sleep on.
2,Leaks are common,"If they would just come up with a design that didn't spring leaks, it would be a great product. I've owned several over the last few years, and most end up leaking. Ironically, the leaks usually occur at the square impressions that are patterned over the surface, which are mostly for looks. These are created with a heat press, and the partial melting creates a weakness, leading to a leak."
4,Excellent bed,The bed is extremely comfortable and very useful as a guest bed. I am disappointed with the time it takes to inflate. The box said that it takes 3 minutes to inflate. My experience is that it never takes less than 7-8 minutes. Same thing for deflating. The box says 1 minute but I have never been able to deflate it in less than 5 minutes.
5,Love sleeping,I bought the Raised Pillowtop Aerobed a few years ago and I love it. I've had family and friends use it and it's great and comfy. My grandkids have fun sleeping on it when they visit.
3,It's ok - but not worth the money,"We got this to as a temporary bed to replace our queen bed that was destroyed by a water leak. It wasn't as comfortable as I thought it would be, especially for the price. The weight distribution was terrible, and the bed moved all over the place when one of us tossed or turned. You'd be better off getting the regular Aero bed, especially if there are two adults sleeping on the same bed!"
5,awesome air bed,My husband and I are staying with my mother for a bit and I got this bed.. I love the ease of the firmness control and I love that it is the height of a normal bed. It is quite comfy.
4,CLASSIC ONE MAN ARMY BATTLE,"this game never gets old, simple gameplay and fun levels make this very entertaining...obviously its an original NES game so the graphics are of that time but the ability to go in and just kill soldiers in your way is a lot of fun...finding the secret staircases and getting the super grenade represent little things that make you want to replay after beating the game...the only slight negative is that bullets do not travel that far...i know its an old game but to have a bullet evaporate .1 of an inch right b4 the enemy gets frustrating, especially in later levels when a lot of bullets are coming ur way and you need to be stealth in your approach...but otherwise this is a blast and one of my fav all time NES games"
3,Great Classic....If you're into classics,"This is an excellent game, I remember playing this years ago. But that's the only problem, don't expect a billion rendered pixels or shadowing, this game is old, but fun. Kind of like Star Craft. The storyline is great, and there are multiple ways to beat this game. Have fun!"
5,Eden- Food For the Soul,"Being a native of Pike.... Pyke County I'd have to say this book really hit ""home"". Eden is a wonderful piece of literature. Eden has power between its pages. Powerful would be an understatement when describing this book. While submerged in Eden I experienced a WIDE range of emotions. Humor- when Aunt Pip and Fat sat around ""shootin' the breeze"" enjoying their feel-goods. Fear- when Chevorlet contemplated shooting the mutt, before Jesus drove up. Sadness- When Willie died/ or was he killed?Eden is an artwork that should get it's due respect, it's proper accolades, and the author Olmpia Vernon (whom I consider the Zora Neal Hurston of this new millenium) should be given national attention for creating Eden at a time when all of us need it the most!"
2,A simplistic view of systems thinking.,"Sorry, I have to disagree with the rest of the reviews above. A serious student of systems thinking will find this book almost childlike. It looks like it was written based on the experiences of someone in a controlled lab instead of the real world. Some concepts are valid and worthwhile, such as the way in which position in the organization determine how people see the system affecting them. But most of the rest of the book is a struggle to get through, due to it's simplistic nature. The font used is almost cartoonish in nature, and the entire book probably could have taken up 40 pages if written in normal font type-spacing.Someone seriously interesting in systems thinking should read. Ackoff, Senge' or Gharajedaghi. Not this book.My favorite systems book is ""Systems Thinking managing chaos and complexity"" by Jamshid Gharajedaghi. That is a brilliant piece of work which deserves serious study.Regards,"
5,Very Insightful and Useful,"This book offers useful new ways to see the human systems we are all part of - relationships, families, companies, communities, nations, etc. I like that the points made and the strategies are so fundamental to human beings that they are applicable to so many situations in life. Ultimately, helps people see themselves and their relationships in ways that can lead to much more effective lives and relationships."
5,Useful frame for understanding our behavior in organizations,This book provides an elegant framework for understanding our behavior in human systems. It is accessible and powerful.
5,very good nutritional drink,My daughter loves this drink. Its nutritious and tasty. I don't worry now-a-days about my 2 yr old daughter not eating properly everyday. There are days where she gets cranky and does not eat her dinner well..then pediasure comes to my rescue. I wiuld recommend all mothers to have this drink at home.
4,not sure what it contains,"I am giving it to my 13 month old son on my pediatrician's recommendation as his weight is in the 20th percentile. He is a healthy kid and eats fine so this is used only as a dietary supplement. He likes the taste and drinks it at night before going to bed.If you look at the list of ingredients, it has about 50 different things. How can such a highly processed food be good for a one year old baby who has not been exposed to too many environmental contaminants as yet? I just can't help wonder why kids' nutrition drinks and/or formulas these days have so many ingredients. Why can't they be simpler? We will find out how these things effect kids' health only after a few years......and I hope it is good..."
4,Good for kids' breakfast...,"My five-year-old twins don't eat much and are very picky on food. They've been drinking PediaSure for their breakfast since they were even younger; it's the only thing they drink, eat in the morning. They drink some juice, mostly soy milk for the rest of the day. It seems to work for them as they are healthy, seldom get sick. The only complaint I have about PediaSure is that it's too sweet! Thankfully, my kids don't eat much other sweets."
1,to much$$$,I get the same amount at my sams club for cheaper! no way i am ordering from here at that price!
2,Disappointing,"Sign was impossible to read, totally illegible due to laout of interior lighting. Very disappointed because I saw one at a haunted house and looked great. Will have to see where they got theirs."
3,Bates sign,a bit pricy but was fun to use on the front door at Halloween---kids didn't get it but the parents sure did!
1,Cheap,The sign was very cheaply made. When lit up you can see the bulbs on the inside poor desgn. Would be a good buy if it were led so it would stand out better and wouldnt be able to see the light bulbs.
4,Quit your gripin',I read the reviews before I ordered. I couldnt understand how it could be so cheap. Well I do now. No one actually says why iy is cheap. It is the material it is made of is like a cheap flimsy and it bends easily. BUT If you hang it up plug it and leave it alone it is five stars all the way. It looks good hanging there and is certainly worth the money it is being sold for now. No its not a high dollar neon sign but it is official licensed and looks just like the bates motel sign. Also note the bulb behind the vacancy part of the sign is a twinkle kind of bulb so the vancancy word looks to be shorted out again just as the real psycho bates motel sign looks in the movies. I think I got my moneys worth.
4,"A fun, inexpensive prop","Wouldn't normally offer a review of an item like this except that I saw the only other review giving it such a low rating. I have a Bates Motel sign just like this that was purchased at Spencers 7 years ago. Is it made of cheap-looking plastic? Yes. Is anyone able to see this when it's lit up in your window at night? No. We've received numerous complements on the sign by trick-or-treaters (and their parents) over the years. And despite being made of plastic, the only reason I stumbled across this review is that two of the bulbs finally burned out- the only problem we've ever had with the sign in 7 years."
1,Not worth the money and very cheap,I bought this thinking it would be a great addition to my Halloween Decor. I was wrong.....dead wrong! It is cheap plastic with overly bright lights that really are too hot for the sign. The bulbs are put in the wrongs spots to make it readable. I do not recommend you wasting your money on this. I wasted $28.00 with shipping. Please listen to me....don't waste your money. Not worth it.
1,Waste of Plastic,The plastic that this sign is made of is a plastic that can be torn if that gives any indication. Definately not even worth $5.00 let alone the huge amount paid for the sign. Going to request a refund.
5,REMARKABLE,"I found this book to be Extraordinary! I ""literally"" could NOT put it down, it is a most fascinating piece of literature! The Book opens with the whole Creation (Intelligent Design) versus Evolution debate. Then the Author uses the disciplines of science, history, prophecy, medicine, archeaology, astronomy, philosophy and mathematics to prove the existence of a Creator and the Bible being God's revelation to man! The next few chapters answer the questions of what God is like, the origin of evil, the problem of suffering in the world and who is Jesus? The Book finally ends with a detailed, yet documented history of religion and dives into controversial topics of today such as Abortion and Homosexuality. The Book offers EVIDENCE for the unbiased skeptic and a true uplifting, encouraging blessing to the Christian Bible Believer. This Book should be in universities and bookstores all over the world.THIS BOOK DESERVES FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY !"
5,This is the second greatest book in the world,"This Book is the second greatest book in the world, next to the Bible. ""The Quest For Truth; Come Now and Let Us Reason Together..."" is awesome, stunning, liberating and truly overwhelming."
1,What was I thinking?,"I stumbled unto this book looking for another I ignored the negative reviews and now I'm reporting on my disappointment from my decision to purchase this book. After the first few pages because of so many errors you don't even want to continue reading it. Dare I say I would have enjoyed getting my teeth pulled more than trying to finish this book. It is a book of such poor quality that I wouldn't even use it to line the bottom of my bird cage( I love my birds ). Anyone considering wether to buy this book or not, I say not. You can have my copy, it's at the city dump."
5,Works good as right angle adapter,"I have a Xfi with a different optical connector than the one found on TVs, consoles, etc. I ordered this not only as an adapter but also to serve as a right angle adapter. I coulda bought a toslink to regular optical cable but it wouldnt have been right angle and this was cheaper anyway."
2,Don't work,"I buy this item to convert an optical output to normal, but don't work. The sound is very bad, and I test in different device"
2,does the job but not well,"it works however, it doesn't fit the optical cable tightly at all. i had to tape the two together. i also ordered the one in the following link and it works much better. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002MQGRM/ref=oss_product"
4,Rothschild Elegance,"This book is wonderfully put together. The photos are vivid and the history of the house is facinating. This is truely a grand English Estate, even if done in the french style usually favored by the Rothschilds. This first family of banking always lived in the most amazing homes, like the home of the U.S. ambassador to France and the Rothschild estate in the south of France. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves European elegance; just a beautiful book. Now if someone would just do a book on Felieres, outside Paris, the ultimate Rothchild grand estate."
3,An exotic biography...,"The Spanish J. J. Benitez is an ambiguous writer. He certainly did an interesting work showing us what would be ""Verne's point of view"" of his own life.On the other hand, the book is full of mysterious and esoteric thinkings from the author that are (at least) hard to believe. Benitez describes ""amazing findings"" but proves no one. Maybe Mr. Benitez should not take himself as the only one that knows the ""hidden true"" of every subject and so he could give us more persuasive stories..."
3,A very good compilation of Sopwith Camel work.,"I can not believe that the music industry has forgotten the best camel album. The miraculous hump returns from the moon. Doesn't anyone else out there wish they could listen to FAZON on CD quality medium. 1975 was a good year for Sopwith Camel, please bring it out of retirement."
4,Good to hear anything by TSC,"It was great to find someplace that even had something by The Sopwith Camel. I'm ordering this one and look forward to seeing more TSC on CD. Having worked in a record store in the mid 70s I know people bought 'the Hump'. My old big disk is about worn out and would hope a release on CD is coming. I agree with other readers ""...where is Fazon?"""
2,One hump or two ?,"It`s a good album but only hints at what is coming with the Hump....almost like comparing ""Love me do"" to ""Sgt Peppers""... I`ll take up the cry from darkest Africa..""Where is the Hump on cd ?"""
5,"Bring the ""HUMP""","Talk about a low down let down. Even though,this first album is good, it would be ""miraculous"" to have the hump on CD"
5,CAN I PLAY WITH MADNESS???????????????,A must own album from Iron Maiden All the songs are the incredible best one of bruce dickenson's best.
3,Good enough,"Maiden is so iconic, what can be said that hasn't been said already. This is not my favorite Maiden album, and it came out during a period when many harder bands were surrounded by hairspray and a commercial embrace of things semi-metal.The video for Can I Play With Madness got some play in its day and is an intelligent song with some evil overtones and Bruce's usual good vocal delivery. Would I trade My Number of the Beast for it? No. Would I trade all my Blaz Baily stuff for it? Yes."
3,SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON,MOONCHILD-5/10INFINITE DREAMS-4/10CAN I PLAY WITH MADNESS-10/10THE EVIL THAT MEN DO-6/10THE PROPHECY-5/10THE CLAIRVOYANT-5/10ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG-8/10
4,Maiden beginning to weak,"Don't get me wrong. I like 7th, the evil that men do is a super classic song. only the good die young is great too. however, can I play with madness sounds weird, I feel like the band is tired. moonchild is also so so. this is the beginning of the end-no, wait, brave new world, just published, is a GREAT album, I liked it much better than 7th. please do listen to it, I would recommend it instead of 7th."
4,Progressive Iron Maiden album,"After Powerslvae, they went a more progressive direction. Seventh Son and Somewhere in Time shows some maturity in their music. The songs aren't as fast and heavy, the band changes and moves forward. They added synthesizer into their music and it made it more unique. It's still heavy metal but not as heavy as their older music and has progressive influences. I really enjoy their 4 latest albums but Seventh Son is their last truly amazing CD."
4,"Great album, a bit heavier on the keyboards than I would like",This is a solid concept album with a bit more keyboard than I would like but still quite heavy. All the rest of the boys are in great form including awesome vocals from Bruce.
4,Another good Maiden,"I'm not a major Maiden fan, but this is good stuff especially compared with all the contemporary rock out there. Maybe I'm getting to be a bit nostalgic here."
4,One of Maidens best,"This album is in my opinion their best and most polished effort to date. ""Can I Play with Madness"" is a classic!"
4,The Last Chapter of Iron Maiden's Golden Era,"I am not a Iron Maiden fan and I don't like most of their albums! Iron Maiden have some songs that I enjoy to listen for exemple Aces High and Fear of the Dark. Still, this album is a really good and I almost buy it. There are nine songs and almost all are terrific! This album sounds are brighter and more variable than Maiden has ever been. Moonchild is a fine opening track allthought its chorus lacks.( 3-/5) Infinite Dreams sounds almost perfect heavy rock song which middle part shows Harris musical skills.(5/5) Can I Play With Madness is a guaranteed Maiden material with hooky chorus ( 4-/5) Evil That Men Do is a great song ( 4/5) Seventh Son of a Sevent Son is long tracks that has many good parts ( 4/5) Prophecy is a little bit boorin but workable song ( 3/5) Clairvoyant is one of the Maiden classics with brilliant quitar riff!( 4/5) Only the Good Die Young ends this album its own interesting way and with great style ( 4/5)"
3,Last Maiden worth buying,"I was a diehard fan from hearing Powerslave and then going backwards to research thier earlier stuff. It's interresting to hear the transition from Dianno to Dickinson, and love all thier stuff. While this album isn't in thier first 5, (which I consider over 15 yrs later as thier best) it's probably thier last ""decent"" album. I'd still buy this one but I could also live without it. It can be said that this album is a slight improvement over Somewhere In Time, but it begins to become obvious with this one as well, that these great musicians are starting to run short on ideas. Hey it happens to all great bands eventually. It was after this album and hearing thier next two albums that I began to realize I wasn't so much an Iron Maiden Fan as a fan of good music. If you like good music this is the last maiden album I can recommend."
5,THE BEST OF MAIDEN,"To Hell with Powerslave. This is the best Iron Maiden album of all time, no question about it. If I were to make a ""Best Of"" compilation, just about every track on this CD would be included. Just buy it. Right now."
3,Going Down!,"This wasn't a bad album, but it's not nearly as great as their earlier stuff. This is when maiden started to decline, actually, somewhere in time was when the first cracks appeared. Still, both albums are good."
1,"NOT a Remastered cd! The word ""enhanced"" distorts true issue","This is a WARNING to anyone that is about to buy this specific version of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son cd. It is NOT a remastered cd! This issue came from 1998. When I bought mine 3 years ago, it was advertised as ""ENHANCED"" [DIGITALLY REMASTERED]. This is a total lie and a waste of money. The CD you want was produced in 2002. I bought three other ""enhanced"" Iron Maiden cd's and I got scammed on those as well. The packaging on the 1998 and 2002 are identical. Make sure you buy the 2002. Maiden pisses me off for putting out way too many repeat cd's of the same material. They use distorted lawyer words like ""enhanced"" and make different song compilation cd's. It has gotten ridiculous. FYI ""enhanced"" means a couple of videos added... Read the cd case and it mentions you should have Windows 98!!!"
4,Seventh Son of a Seventh Son,"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is the 7th studio album by Iron Maiden and was released in 1988 and to me it is an album that is a rock album with heavy metal elements but not an album that is a pure Heavy Metal album. The booklet contains no lyrics but does have a list of whom plays what. The album was met with poisitive reviews by Allmusic, Kerrang! and Sputnikmusic. Even though I find their sound to be Heavy Metal light this is not a bad album with great melodies and some great guitar solos. The songs I like the most are the following: ""Can I Play With Madness"", ""The Evil That Men Do"" and ""The Clairvoyant"". 4/5."
5,Probably their Masterpiece,"This is tied with Powerslave for my favorite Maiden CD of all time. I bought the cassette when it first came out back when I was in the Navy, just before we went to Hawaii. For that reason Seventh Son will always remind me of Hawaii. It seems that every Maiden album tells a story, an this one is no different. From the opening ""Moonchild"", on through ""Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son"", this album is like listening to the perfect audio book. I have yet to see a more talented songwriter than Steve Harris, nor a more perfect story teller than Bruck Dickenson. Let's not forget Smith, Murray, and McBrain; without them this album wouldnt be as amazing as it is. It's the kind of album that let's you put on the headphones, crank up the volume, and be transported thru time and space to a place that only Iron Maiden can take you. Up the Irons!"
3,It's Still Growing On Me,"When ""Seventh Son"" first came out I hated it. I felt that the band put the ""concept"" before the music, the guitar-synth heavy tunes were the polar opposite of songs found on ""Powerslave"", ""Number of the Beast"" and ""Killers"". But, occasionally I would pull the cd back out and with time I came to appreciate what Iron Maiden was doing with ""Seventh Son"" and several of the songs on the disk are pretty good. The title track is my favorite, it has that epic sound Maiden made famous with tunes like ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"". ""Only the Good Die Young"", ""The Evil That Men Do"" and ""The Prophecy"", though very heavily laden with guitar-synth, are still recognizable as Iron Maiden. Judging by other reviews you either love this album, or hate it. And though I enjoy this cd now, I wouldn't recommend ""Seventh Son"" as the first Maiden disk to start your collection, I would pick this up only after you have become a fan of the band through their other albums first."
2,This album is retarded!,"That pretty much sums it up. Dorky lyrics and bland music really killed this one. I bought this one the day it came out, still have the tape. I listen to it about once a year at the most. I've long since worn out my other Maiden tapes and replaced them with CDs but this one won't ever get replaced. Up the Irons!"
2,"This is not what iron Maiden should be,,","I liked every maiden album before this one, so I expected a lot of this, but this album just has not the quality of Powerslave or Somewhere In time. To many average songs on this like Can I Play With Madness, Only The Good Die Young and The Evil That men Do. The rest is good, but not great. Infinite Dreams and the title track are my favorites of this album, and they are superb. But not the whole album is superb. Don't buy this unless you are a Die hard maiden fan!"
2,The End of Maiden,"This is pretty much where Iron Maiden stops being Maiden in my book and I would think that I would be the last to say this as a dedicated Maiden fan since Number of the Beast came out. Compared to what they had produced before, this album is simply the pits. Aaargh! Just horrible in every department; lyrically and musically. The synthesized sound is just overdone and was already overdone in Somewhere in Time. 'Moonchild', 'Evil That Men Do', and 'Only the Good Die Young' are the best songs on this album. 'Infinite Dreams' is also fairly decent. The rest is pretty bad by Maiden standards and the lyrics are just bland. 'Can I Play With Madness?' Please; it sounds like a kid asking if he can play on the swing for a couple of more minutes. Just awful!"
2,terrible!,this is almost like gospel! the fron cover is cool but the lyrics are awful! where's the old lyrics? they were cool! i like some of the melodies!
1,Their worst album by far!,"A friend said this album was ""incredible"". Yeah right! I was eager when listening to sound samples, so I checked it out. The first thing I heard was this PINK FLOYD-type ballad and I'm thinking to myself ""This is the same band that did 'Run To The Hills'?????????? No way!"" I always listen to sound samples before buying an album, so I can know what to expect. If you are new to MAIDEN, I would recommend ""Iron Maiden"", ""Killers"", ""Number Of The Beast"", ""Piece Of Mind, or ""Powerslave"". But not this!"
4,The last great maiden album,"This is 4.5 album, almost a perfect maiden album. I think the first 5 were maiden's best, but somwhere in time and seventh son are very close and is the end of the maiden golden era. ""moonchild"" is probably my favorite."
5,Maiden's best.,In Seventh Son Steve Harris and the boys combine their progressive rock roots with their ferocious heavy metal to create the most musically complex and exciting album I've ever heard by anyone. A combination of spellbinding lyrics and masterful instrumental passages makes this a true masterpiece.
5,UP THE IRONS!!!,"This is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time. Perhaps the best maiden album. Once you hear Seventh Son you'll be amazed by the guitar, bass and vocal work. Steve Harris is a genius!CONCLUSION: BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!"
4,The End of an Era,"SSoaSS is probably the last really good album that Iron Maiden put out. There are a few weak cuts but, overall, the disc is solid. ""Can I Play With Madness"" is a Maiden classic. I hadn't listened to this for a decade; I had forgotten how good this disc is."
5,A Mature Maiden,"I bought this album when I was 12 and I've been a Maiden fan ever since. I still beleive this is their best effort to date and it amazes me when fans slag the record off. This is a complex album, you've got to put a bit of aural effort in before you can appreciate it fully! Granted, it doesnt have the immediacy of a ""wasted years"" or ""run to the hills,"" but it repays the listener with an untouched complexity after a few listens. Maiden must have considered it a gamble to release a concept album at what was probably the height of their success, but it paid off on the strength of these songs. Have they ever before (or since) released an album with no ""weak"" songs? I dont think so. So I agree that there have been individual songs that may be better than any individual song on ""seventh son"", but this album is a classic and no other maiden album can touch it...so far. Up the Irons!"
5,Exellent! Maiden's Best Work To Date.,"This CD is exellent. ""Infinite Dreams"", ""Can I Play With Madness"", ""The Evil That Men Do"", and ""The Clairvoyant"" are all classics that any Maiden fan can sing off the top of their head. ""Infinite Dreams"" is a great song with metallic guitar that is great to hear in concert. ""Can I Play With Madness"""" is a poppier song but is wonderful and is the most known song off the album. The title track is a great slab of metal with a memorable chorus. ""The Evil That Men Do"" and ""The Clairvoyant"" are two other great standouts. The album closes on a high note with the rocker ""Only The Good Die Young"". In conclusion, this is Maiden's best work and should not be missed, no matter if it is a concept album."
1,"Pass on these Public Domain DVDs, get the MPI restored DVD!","Since MPI has restored all of the classic Sherlock Holmes movies on DVD from 35mm fine grain prints, there is absolutely NO reason to buy anybody elses grainy release!"
1,Sound!,I love these old Basil Rathbone flicks. The sound quality was unbelievably bad. I couldn't hear the dialog for the hissing. You think Amazon could spring for an enhanced version. Unfortunately taken it off my watchlist
3,Holmes & the Dancing Men,"The second in Universal's Holmes series of mysteries with a dash of wartime propaganda is an okay entry. It's more of an adventure than a mystery, notable for Rathbone adopting two varied and effective disguises as well as one of the oddest scenes in any movie. Once captured by Moriarty, Holmes elaborately describes a particularly devious manner to kill someone that Moriarty immediately implements against Holmes. Okayyyyyyy."
3,Holmes Matches Wartime Wits With Moriarty,"""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon"" (1943) is one of the better World War II entries - pitting Basil Rathbone's immortal detective against Lionel Atwill's sinister Professor Moriarty. In his first Holmes effort, director Roy William Neill makes the most of a ""blood-draining"" climax. Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson is far less bumbling than usual, with the comic relief provided by Dennis Hoey's debut as Inspector Lestrade. Fast-moving escapism that gets the job done in 68 minutes. Avoid the inferior public-domain DVDs and purchase this MPI release, which offers an excellent 35mm restoration by the UCLA Film and Television Archive."
3,"""Secret Wepons for sail!""","Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are exelent as ever in their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H. Watson. Once again, Sherlock Holmes is up against his faverate enemy. This time they must have a battle of wits while trying to get a bombsight. Not the best instolment in the searies. The plot is weak at points but hold with the humor. Rathbone does a good resighting of a William Shakespeare quote at the end."
3,Holmes in WWII,"Sherlock Holmes gets transported to WWII in this episode of the classic film series, as Holmes tries to protect a scientist who has devised a new kind of bomb sight that will help the English in their battle against the Germans. However, he is up against his old foe Professor Moriarity who wants to sell the information to the Germans. A lot happens in the space of just over an hour, which is a good thing, as the film is filled with disguises, tricks, a secret code, and Holmes' life hangs in the balance more than once. Of course, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are good as usual, with Rathbone getting to disguise himself a few times and doing a good job of it. Lionel Atwill is Moriarity in this film, and he's sinister as always. I enjoyed the quick pace of this film, plus all of the twists and turns. I'm hoping to see more films in this series."
2,gloves,"Year after year they never, EVER have an adult Spider-Man costume that includes gloves and boots. Is it really that difficult to include those as well? I mean, come on!"
5,"great, but kind small..","Ok, so I got this in plenty of time for halloween this year. I'm a soldier in Iraq, and when the people in my company got a sight of me in skin tight spandex.. well.. hilarity ensued.. I would definately recommend a jock strap and cup, because I had to place my junk in a sock so that there would be no genital definition.. wife made me :) I'm about 6'2, and the costume was way too short for me.. but it'd be good for the average guy of 5'9, or 5'10.. but for the laughs I got, it was totally worth the $30.. seeing as I won $50 in our costume contest.. there was a little danving involved, had to shake my stuff.. and until you see a tall, skinny white guy shakin his groove thing in a skin tight spiderman costume.. well.. you just haven't lived.."
2,mamaduck,"A one time, maybe 2 uses you will get as the fabric is inferior; has many ""runs"" - like in your nylon stockings, so there is no repairing that can be done to it. Seems to be made the same as a childs' costume only bigger? For an adult we expected it would have been manufactured with a higher quality fabric/design."
4,Halloween Fun!,I ordered this for my boyfriend for Halloween. It runs a bit small but he was like a giddy little kid when he put it on and got compliments all night.
5,More details...,"This is a very beautiful set, but, for us, has a funny story. I was looking for a dark haired doll for an adopted child in our family. We wanted to give her a doll that looked like her. She has dark hair and tan skin. When I looked at this doll, she looked like she would match the child we were giving this to. However, when it came, the doll was african american....the child is not. I got the giggles because the doll that I got to look like this child looks nothing like her. Having said that, she is a beautiful doll and this set is very nice. I am sure this little girl will just love this set. However, it won't be because the doll looked like her - grin!I added this information because I know there are families looking for african american dolls for their girls. This doll is african american (which I didn't see in the description and couldn't clearly tell from the picture). Both the doll and the set are very nice and well made. Enjoy!"
3,another stupid review,I ordered this book for my wireless kindle e book I did not like the book it was not what I wanted
5,A Great Read,"This is an enjoyable book. Why? There is no murder; but you expect one at any moment.We start with the ""Gaudy Night"" a reunion and meeting of female graduates and present students. First there are unsettling and obscene scrawlings. It escalates to a prank in the chapel; then vandalism in a student's apartment.There are many red herrings in this novel. When you think you've got it figured out, along comes another clue!This is not a traditional whodunit in the tradition of Agatha Christie. The novel has a romantic subplot and some polemics. This does not detract from the story.I loved the character of Lord Peter Wimsey. Many writers get stuck in the mode of putting the sleuth in the character of a Jane Marple or a Hercule Poirot. Lord Peter is a unique character."
1,A tough slog,"This book was a real disappointment. I love period mysteries, but this one never really had any suspense. In fact, it was hard to even finish it. It started out very slowly and kept that pace. Too much trivial conversation and no action. It was somewhat educational regarding the period and a particular class of people. But, just too hard to survive a whole book of it."
2,Very British in language and slow reading.,"I bought this when it was featured on the kindle and I accidentally dropped the book one night... since it was bought I had to read it. Slow first half, I started writing down strange English words, and that kept me reading. I did not enjoy the plot or all the characters. Now, half way through the hero has just arrived at the scene."
3,More information about the landscape than I wanted,"I liked the story line, but was bored with wll the descriptions of the Oxford area.......I have been thereand am somewhat familiar with the area, but I didn't need to hear about all of it over and over again.Enjoyed the story - the characters -"
2,Not as good as the other Peter Wimsey mysteries,"I'd read and enjoyed a few of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries by Dorothy Sayers years ago when the PBS series was on, so I eagerly looked forward to this one when I saw it on Amazon. However, I was very disappointed. Since a whodunit has to have many characters, the problem is that the female characters, of which there are many, are barely distinguishable from one another and are rather colorless. Even the protagonist, Harriet Vane, is insipid. The only one who is at all interesting is Lord Peter himself, but he is not around for much of the novel. In addition, Lord Peter is madly in love with Harriet, so that detracts from his attractiveness. The plot itself is fairly well thought out, but I knew the solution before the end. The other problem is Sayer's feminist agenda which is a bit shrill, overtaking both plot and characters. That agenda is also rather outdated and simplistic in this 1936 story."
3,Wonderful story...Terrible edition,"This is my favorite Lord Peter story and I was thrilled when it became available on Kindle. However, they forgot to hire a proof-reader. The very first mention of Lord Peter's valet spells his name ""Burner""! This edition is so full of misspellings and bad punctuation it spoils the reading experience. It's disrespectful of Dorothy Sayers and of the reader, so I gave it only three stars, otherwise it would get five."
3,Not a great edition,"The novel, of course, is brilliant; sadly, this electronic edition has a lot of obvious misreadings, and that's not including the quotations of Classical writers in the Greek alphabet. If you're going to read this novel for the first time, go to your local library and borrow the oldest, dustiest copy you can find. Read that five or ten times, then decide if you really need it on your e-reader. If so, this edition will do."
2,A good 138 page mystery in 500 pages.,"In this Novel Ms. Sayers seems to be going through some midlife crisis. She seems to want to show that she is more than just a mystery writer, and to do this she fills the pages with many obscure references to that show that she is a scholar. She also gives us travel log of Oxford in case anyone doubted that she attend a college there.The pages of the novel a strewn with banal dialog that does not seem to have any purpose other than to show that the author is familiar with the banter (or is it blather) that occurred in a womans college in the 1930's.In the other Wimsey ofter makes literary quotes, uses some Latin and French, but you normally don't have to translate it to decide what is happening in the novel.==Spoiler==Even in the last paragraph Ms. Sayers rather than having Harriet say a simple ""I will"" has her and Peter quoting from some 12th century play.If I had to describe this novel is a single word it would be: pretentious!"
2,Brilliant but flawed,"""Gaudy Night"" is one of my two favorite Sayers books. ""Nine Tailors"" is the other. So I don't need any reviews to know it's a great story and well written. And I wanted it unabridged. I wasn't crazy about having to buy the CD version by Ian Carmichael because I don't really care for his voice, but that was the only thing available. I'm enjoying it anyway. What I didn't like was that the final track of 4 of the discs would not load onto my iPod. I'm not enough of a technician to understand why, and am talking to the manufacturer about it."
5,The English Classic Mystery,"Whereas we Americans were sopping up noir novels and films of Chandler and Cain, the English were serving up their version of the mystery with the elegant writer Doroty L. Sayers. In this novel she puts her detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, into the story, as usual, but gives his girlfriend, Harriet Vane, center stage. Harriet returns to her college reunion and while having a great time with her old chums suddenly starts receiving poisen pen letters. Like her American counterparts though, Sayers is interested in the characters and what they are able to observe of the best and worst in people. However, they don't do it with the hard edged noir American style. The English style is quiet, elegant, country houses and colleges, lords, gentlemen and their ladies and then, intruding into this perfect world, The Crime and what the crime does to the people around it. Sayers remains my favorite of the British writers who either started this tradition or carry it on today."
4,Wordy night,"Loaned to me by a friend, this book has given me a lot to chew on. Matters of principal, academic righteousness, gender essentialism, dominance, class relations, all are brought up in this novel, a very ambitious ""whodunit."" Some of these issues are tackled in a straightforward manner, and others only peripherally.Lord Peter and Harriet are presented as winning characters, and most of the secondary characters are fleshed out pretty nicely -- a difficult thing to do with a large cast. Still, it was too easy to get the different dons mixed up.Lastly, this is my first Sayers novel, and I don't think the reading experience was particularly marred by a lack of familiarity with the previous books. Rather, I felt disturbed by my inability to catch the literary references. Knowing your classics would serve you much better than knowing your other Sayers."
4,Such a pleasure!,"I actually listened to the audiobook. I agree with the reviewer that said the book was anti-climactic and that it's not one of those mysteries the reader can solve from gathering information along the way. That said, it was so thoroughly enjoyable! Maybe this was due to the delightful actors in the audiobook but it was such a pleasure for me to spend time with these dear characters."
4,Gaudy Review,"If you are a Harriet Vane fan, this is the Sayers' mystery for you. She gets the job early and we learn much more about the mystery writer and friend of Lord Peter."
3,Not what I expected,This was o.k. but rather wordy. It was not what I expected. There was a little trouble keeping up with all the characters with similar names.
3,Typical Sayers is great,"Dorothy Sayers Wimsey books are fun. However, be prepared for erudite references that are at times difficult to decipher. Gaudy Night is in the middle of Peter and Harriet's long courtship. If you have not read earlier Wimsey tales it might be best to do so before reading this one. Whose Body for example gives a nice prelude to the affair and Peter's personal demons. All around Gaudy Night is a solid Sayers and that is saying a lot."
2,Great book but poorly formatted for kindle,"This is one of my favorite Wimsey stories, but I am finding it almost impossible to read because the margins are so wide that the reading area on my kindle fire is barely two inches wide with inch wide margins on each side. Since the book is formatted fully justified I am often left with only two long words to a line with a big gap between them. For example, on one line is space for only the two words:wretched newspaperIt's a great story, but this poorly formatted kindle book makes it very difficult to read."
5,Review of Gaudy Night,All of Dorothy Sayers' works are great -- this being one of her better ones (probably best) -- I sent for it because I wanted to have it to reread when the mood strikes. I have yet to find one of the newer mystery writers who can in any way compare with her.
4,Good presentation of a great Dorothy Sayers book,I am a major Dorothy Sayers fan & Gaudy Night is my favorite of her books. This audiobook presentation was nicely done. I don't always like versions performed as plays since they often are hard to follow or voices are distracting. This rendition did a good job of keeping me on track & entertained. I wish I could afford to buy an unabridged narrative audiobook version but this is very enjoyable & totally affordable.
4,How very British and how very droll.,"This is a wonderful and joyous romp through the world of words. The mystery is almost secondary to the travelogue presented with familiar and personal account. The characters come alive at once interesting though sometimes trying to the overburdened reader. No matter, the book is a fabulous divergence from today's realities. The conversations exploit the readers knowledge of both poetry and philosophy. There is much for the feminists of this millennium to compare to the last century of not so long removed. An enjoyable, comfortable read. Be sure to read with a biscuit and steaming cup of tea."
2,What's with the cost?!,"Definitely the best of the Wimsey novels. Sharp of whit with well developed characters. Harriet finally is forced to face herself and give in to the fact that Peter will always treat her as an equal and she loves him for it. I was so happy to see this available for Kindle. As I can still pick up paperback editions at half the price, it will be a long time before I add this one to my beloved Kindle. Really people, $12 for a book written over 75 years ago?!It's a well written, popular novel that would probably have been out in paperback form since Roosevelt was President!"
1,Diabetics Beware,"It's over thirty years since I read GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. I don't suppose I'll ever read them again. By the time she wrote them, Sayers had lost whatever she had to offer as a mystery writer. She was taking herself seriously. In Harriet Vane, Sayers produced perhaps the most nauseating wish fulfilment figure in the whole of crime fiction. She makes Jemima Shore look like something out of Dostoyevsky. Avoid like the plague unless you wish to gross out on snobbery and sentimentality. And the murder method in BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON is singularly unconvincing."
1,A Dithering Mess,"If you have enjoyed other Peter Winsey mysteries, you will be disappointed. The ""crime"" is a poison pen writer at (Harriet's alma mater, as if she is not competent to investigate anything more serious)Manners and language of another age form an intrusive barrier to following the germ of plot through many vagaries - a most unsatisfying foray, yet testament to the waning influence of the English upper class system, despite the author's clear snobbery regarding lower class persons and tiresome pontificating about the 'role of women' . Having enjoyed other Sayers works, this one is a big null set."
1,Dorothy Sayers at her best - glad Amazon had the book,"This is a great book. It's one of the top 100 books written in the 20th century according to 3 different sources. Dorothy Sayers is one of my favorite authors and this book was wonderful. If you read it, find a way to keep track of the many, many characters. I didn't and had to keep going back to look things up."
5,A superb novel of mystery and love,"Sayers famously once said (to paraphrase) that love had no business cluttering up a good mystery. Yet the love story in this novel, the climax of the Harriet Vane-Lord Peter Wimsey affair*, forms the meat of this intelligent, witty, and still fresh mystery. Set in 1930's Oxford, Harriet must help her former college solve a mystery while solving the mystery of her heart's desire. I can't recommend this novel too highly. * You may wish to read Strong Poison and Have His Carcase first."
3,Dust off your vocabulary,"Interesting period piece involving scandalous vandalism at Shrewsbury College for women. Harriet Vane an alumnus of Shrewsbury is asked to solve this mystery without bring in the police. Additionally, the reader is privy to Harriet's struggle with her relationship with Lord Peter Wimsey. The language of the book is not only very British, but also very erudite. The reader will need to be familiar with British idiom and have an excellent vocabulary. Although the relationship stuff sometimes stalls the story, and the guilty party seemed to me to be very obvious, this book is a good read."
5,Tnagerine dream rocks!!,"this is a superb album, with the classic eighties sound van TD. Made at the hights of there succes. Part 2 trully rocks!!"
4,Excellent resoure for H.S. Grammar Instruction,"Blumenthal's English 2000, 2600, and 3200 series are comprehsive and fast paced. My high school english students actually enjoy studying grammar using these books. All three texts give the student a thorough, practical knowledge of English usage and grammar."
4,And Then Came Love,"By conceiving a child via artificial insemination, hip, modern and thoroughly independent magazine writer Julie Davidson managed to trim the messy nuptial relationship strings so often attached to starting a family. Imagine her shock, then, when her now-six-year-old son, Jason, demonstrates his growing need for a paternal role model by misbehaving in school. Julie soon sets out on a quest to find the original sperm donor youngish, self-effacing actor Paul, hoping he will take some responsibility for Jason's awry behavior. Father and son do indeed forge a strong relationship; but in Julie's wildest imagination, she never expected to fall in love with this new acquaintance. A fair number of halfway decent scenes and an overall feeling of goodwill, ""And Then Came Love"" is simply too slick, too contrived and too insubstantial to rank as anything more than just a negligible romantic comedy. I enjoyed watching the movie."
2,Predicatble to a Fault,"Weak storyline, lackluster acting. I can not recommend this film, even if you do Like Vanessa Williams. This was not her best film. She's a much better actress than this films allowed. Very predicatable plot, a yawn."
1,Supremely disappointing,"All of the Breeders work before this I LOVE LOVE LOVE. I think they're one of the best bands of the past twenty plus years and are responsible for some of the atristic highpoints of that time. That being said this album is completely devoid of anything interesting, amusing, appealing or of any value whatsoever. I nearly trashed it after I first listened to it, but tried again about six weeks later, then six months later, and now at about a year or so I gave it one last shot and still haven't enjoyed a second of it. It sounds like a mediocre garage band slugging through a ho-hum rehearsal. Probably the most disappointed I've ever been by a CD purchase."
4,glory days revisited,"the wonderful last two albums, pod and last splash, truthfully,are way better than this. if you are a first time breeders fan, go for last splash, not this. but if you feel daring, go for this. its moody, daring, and beautiful.tracks like ""london song"" and ""little fury"" are good,but ""huffer"" is a brief and very memorable song, and is the reason i coughed up 13 bucks to get it."
5,Kim Hughes Doesn't Have What Kim Deal Has,"It's obvious that the so-called ""professional"" review provided by Amazon is literally skewed, and could be the result of some kind of pop criticism payola monkey business. After all, next to money, there's nothing more powerful than the written word and the ""authority of print"" can persuade and literally make money appear where once there was none. The bottom line, aside from the backroom deals and the money-in-the-envelope schtick, is that reviewer Kim Hughes wants what Kim Deal has, namely sexuality.And there's nothing more pitiful on the planet than a sexless popular music critic.So, forget what Kim is saying about the Breeders because Kim doesn't get it. This CD has the same almost rusty charm as the other Breeders classics, even if it is in a more slowed-down form."
1,Unimpressed... Sorry!,"I know there is a tendency for people to only review albums that they like, and I apologise if I offend any Breeders fan out there, but I didn't like this album at all.I am a Pixies fan and liked Pod and Last Splash. that's not to say I am a bitter Pixies fan blaming everything on Kim either.I just feel that this is an album that needed more work. It's like a rough draft that never got re-written but was published anyway.I think it's fair to say that if you are looking to buy your first Breeders album this is not the one to buy. I really was disappointed with this album.Perhaps I needed to play it a few times more but there's only so many times I can listen to an album before I say 'I really don't like it', and this is one of those times. Sorry."
1,"Kim Deal, what's the deal?","To say that I'm disappointed in ""Title TK"" is understatement. It's been 9 years since ""Last Splash"" and it's a fitting description of Breeder's history since this new release sinks straight to the bottom. The songs sound like they were improvised as the tape was running in the studio. What really annoys me is the fact that after such a long hiatus, Kim Deal had the audacity to rehash an Amps song (Full on Idle), which by the way, pales in comparison to the original. What's the matter Kim, suffering from a bit of writer's block these past 9 years? Luckily, ""Huffer"" is an outstanding track that gives me hope for the future (I just hope the wait isn't as long next time)."
1,an achievment! (the worst record ever made),"Unreal in its amorphous tunelessness, the breeders may have made the most unlistenable record EVER.i love the guy who said that only ""accidentally"" was LAST SPLASH melodic--and that TITLE TK was what happens ""when the drugs wear off.""hahahahaha. wow is this ever painful! gimme a swift kick up the bum or an afternoon in a dentist's chair before i ever spin this again. to make sure of it--i threw the bleeder in the rubbish.Ouchly, kim!! you're horrible!!!! (and prolly don't care.)"
2,lackluster,"This album has a few bright moments but on the whole it really comes up short. The Breeders have proven themselves of being able to produce top notch indie-rock. However, this record seems more like an attempt to just make a quick buck buy selling records to their dedicated fan base, selling out a few smaller venues and selling some t-shirts. We deserve more from these talented sisters.If you have always loved the Breeders, you might as well pick it up to complete your pixies/breeders collection, otherwise, go check out earlier material by them. You will be blown away."
4,shakes the house,"These people are serious about rock and roll. This is a very tough record. The mix has the bass up so high that it does shake the house the way that few other records I have heard do. The lyrics are obtuse in a good way, and definitely create an atmosphere of danger and debauchery. The dark side of certain areas of LA, as far as I can tell. But with a sense of humor, like in the ridiculous intro to ""London Song."" And as always with the Breeders there is really strong melody. The only drawbacks are that it is too short and maybe the song ""Put on a Side"" (although it is growing on me)."
2,Nine years and this is it??,"What a disappointment this album is! Nine long years since their last album, and this is all we get? This sounds like a quickie album that was put together for contractual obligations, recorded in a basement while they were sitting on couches watching TV. It could be understandable if they had released another album just 6 months prior and wanted to break away from a bad contract. But this isn't the case here. This album is simply inexcusable. The vocals are drab, the music is plain, and the song writing is uninspired. If you want to hear some good Breeders music, I recommend the album Pacer from The Amps. That was Kim Deal's other group for 5 minutes, and was basically the follow-up album to Last Splash. It has far better material and sounds alive and vibrant."
3,We waited 9 years for this?,"While this is still better that most of the albums released in 2002, shouldn't we expect more from Kim Deal, the genius behind ""Gigantic"" and ""Cannonball""? She seems to have lost the girly-peppy pop-punk charm from earlier Breeder albums. Her voice is still beautiful and smoky, but it is sad and not as spunky as usually heard. She's still weird at least, ""Has anyone seen the iguana?"" but I was disappointed in this album. Get Last Splash or Pod instead for a better Breeder experience."
3,"Truly Fast, but beware of compatibility and tech support","I purchased the Fasttrak TX2000 to improve the capture rate of analog video. I'm using it to stripe two 7200RPM Ultra drives. Now that I have it running, it has exceeded my expectations nearly tripling my capture rate. However, installation was painful. It is known to be incompatible with some chipsets (I have the 815E but the 845 is a known problem) when using an nVidia graphics card. I absolutely could not get both my nVidia GeForce card and the Fasttrak to work together. It is also known not to work with the ATI All-in-Wonder, thought I ended up using the Radeon. Be sure to check your chipset, graphics card, and info on the Promise web site before buying this card. And don't expect any tech support - I submit 6 emails and called them twice. I never got a response, nor was the phone answered. I give this card 5 stars for performance (with a compatible graphics card) but 0 stars for lack of support."
4,"Great book, but not as much variance as I expected","This was a great book and I would definitely recommend it to others. I was however expecting more than one regression case study...there was just one and at times, I would find myself skipping over pages to get through some of the monotony (spelling?). But again, it was interesting all the same and I am glad that I had the chance to read this."
5,Everyone should read this book.,This book answered a lot of questions I've had over the years. Can't wait to read more of her books.
5,Very interesting book,"I just finished reading this book and wanna say that it was an amazing experience and now I'm ready to change my life constantly.But my advise to everyone who wants to start reading this book is to read Jesus and the Essenes first!Jesus and the Essenes is like the Bible. You will be amazed by the information you'll find in Jesus and the Essenes book! Everything is so obvious and easy to understand, that now all the mystery moments and occasions from the Bible will be opened to you."
3,Vivid detail of Jesus as a human being,"This book by Dolores Cannon contains material that you certainly will not find in any of the gospels! This book touched me deeply because it gave me a ""sense"" of the real Jesus, a human being, not the son of God. Many of the scenes are extremely vivid covering the temple at Jerusalem, the leper colonies, high drama around the crucifixion etc. For those of you who believe in past lives (and I for one certainly do), I strongly recommend this book."
2,Leaves white marks on dark clothes,"This deodorant is truly unscented. It is not invisible as advertised. Also, right after I put on the deodorant and a dark color shirt I will see white stains from deodorant on the shirt.I mainly got it for the ""invisible"" part."
1,IT BLEACHES,"I couldn't figure out why my clothes were bleaching, then when I switched to a new anti perspirant the problem disappeared! BAN IS BAD! BAD STAINS. UUGhhh...I lost hundreds of dollars in clothes because of it, and I even thought I should go to a doctor! This can't be healthy."
3,I found this movie curiously uninvolving,"Everyone else seems to love this movie, but it just didn't do much for me (or my wife). The two little girls are captivating, but everyone else left us cold. The acting seemed over-the-top, while the storyline just lumbered along. The scene where Johnny and Mateo get in each other's faces came across as some of the worst overacting I've ever seen.Maybe to fully appreciate this movie you have to have lost a child, or experienced some other great tragedy. But I thought it was kind of flat and in places tedious. Not the worst movie I've seen lately, but far from the best. I'd recommend ""Whale Rider"" over this, any day."
5,Pure Greatness,One of the best movies if not the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. I found NO weak point in the movie. Acting is superb. I don't know why it is not in major theaters...hopefully it is a sleeper like My Big Fat Greek Wedding. You cannot keep a film like this down.
4,GOOD PERFORMANCES ALL AROUND IN THIS BITTERSWEET STORY!,"'In America' is an impressive little film about great loss and not appreciating what you have. The story is about a young Irish couple with two young daughters. The family comes to the United States to make a better life for themselves, but there is more below the surface. They can't cope with the loss of the young son who died and running away never really solves anything. The acting is very good in this film, especially the two young daughters who I felt were above and beyond most kids in these types of films.The parents and the neighbor who becomes their friend also give excellent performances. The story could have been a sappy mess, but turns out to be a subtle winner. I caught this on cable so I'm not sure about the DVD release but, it is definitely worth a look."
5,A Minor Masterpiece,"One of the most deeply-felt and moving films of our time. It is about being an alien and loving one's children. It is one of my all-time favorites, and I have sent copies to my daughters."
4,Good movie but get out the kleenex.,"In the old days this movie would have been called a ""chick flick"". Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC. The family consists of a husband and wife with two young daughters who are trying to make it in America as poor Irish emigrants. Throw in the fact that the family has just experienced the death of another child, a young brother. One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years."
5,IN AMERICA,Saw it when it was on TV & it was Great!! So we bought it to see again. Buy it! You'll like it!
3,Pretty Good,"the Movie got heavy handed in spots,but I felt the vaule&Lessons being used in the film. the ""Et"" element was good.evrybody fit well within there roles.I just think the film tried to take on so much&left some spots,but it has sentiments that stay with you."
4,"Evocative, emotional and memorable",A pitch perfect tale of overcoming loss and beginning afresh told with masterly skill by Jim Sheridan. Edges close but never tips into sentimentality and is marvellously upbeat despite some truly difficult circumstances the family encounters. With considerable generosity of spirit this is a film to lose yourself in and relish. Amazingly realistic and honest. Brilliant.
5,What a soundtrack,Two magical moments occur when the picture and the music deliver a punch. This movie brings a smile to your face and a feel good feeling to your soul.
3,"Acting was great, story was not.","The acting of Samantha Morton and the girls is excellent. But this movie is supposedly a realistic portrayal of how difficult day-to-day survival can be, yet I found most of the storyline to be unbelievable. There were too many ""that would never happen"" moments for me."
3,Movie was slow but very heart felt. Had a lot of compassion for people who try and start a new life here.,Not very good sound. Was good for a copy but lacked sound quality. Had to turn T V way up!
3,Phiten too big for my wrist,It was my mistake. I should have sized my wrist before I ordered the bracelet. It's just a little too big for my wrist.
2,Velcro Came un-glued and fell off.,"A fabric bracelet with a glued on velcro closure. After a few days of wearing the velcro portion of the closure fell off. I reglued it, and it fell off again. I then reglued it with Lock-Tite silicone glue, and it has stayed on for the past few days. Not worth the price (in my opinion), just a cheaply made cloth braclet that does nothing. It does look kind of cool on though."
5,"In good condition, as promised...","The bracelet was received in good condition, and appeared to be new. I gave it to my friend as a gift, and she was terribly excited."
2,Pointless,"This was one of those, ""maybe my common sense is on holiday"" items. I had had an accident and damage to an ankle that was described vividly by one of the reviewers and hope that as this wristlet had helped him- etc, etc, etc.It didn't.Pity.But that's me."
4,Noticable effect!,"I have had the Phiten star bracelet for a few weeks now. I had tendonitis that was most noticable when lifting weights (curls). After a week of wearing the bracelet, the pain seems to have subsided. Before buying the Phiten, I felt the pain despite giving my arm a rest for several weeks.Coincidence or placebo? Maybe......but there was a direct relationship between wearing the bracelet and my noticing the pain to be all but gone within a week or so. So I wear one now almost all the time. 4 out of 5 because the velcro looks like it can come undone during sports (would prefer a plastic snap clasp), but for normal use, it stays put just fine. Recommended and and results may vary, of course!"
3,Couldn't tell a difference after wearing this...,"I thought this product was going to make a visible and evident difference in my performance (I play tennis). It did nothing for me, although it looks cool."
5,really works??,was skeptical if it would actually work.once i had it on for about two days i noticed less and less pain.
2,Too small; fell off and lost,"The bracelet was a little too small for my wrist, but I wore it anyway and it fell off and I lost it within a few days of purchase. (The Phiten necklace that I bought with it broke after a few weeks.)"
1,Phiten Hello Kitty Bracelet,The bracelet does not have any of the SUPER POWERS that the product claims to have. It's just an expensive piece of rubber.
5,A Skeptic Now A Believer,"I have been diagnosed with ""Tennis Elbow"", in my case, caused by years of playing saxophone, which requires repetitive motion, particularly in the right arm and right elbow.Having gone through physical thereapy and exercises, which DID NOT HELP the pain, and taking a lot of NSAID'S, a friend suggestedone of these bracelets.I bought one, not expecting anything. The results are incredible, and my range of motion in the forearm and elbow are at least 90percent back, and the pain is virtually GONE.As some have written here, it may be ""All In The Mind.""Fine with me. After several thousand dollars in medical treatments by ""experts"", all I can offer to anyone, is, TRY IT!"
4,Phiten Star Bracelet,Good item that seems to relieve pain in my arm. Also odered the necklace and it relieves the pain in my neck and shoulders.
1,Garbage,I have arthritis in both hands and wrists. Tried this as a last resort to help me and it did nothing. They don't work at all. I play golf and was really hoping it would help. I felt absolutely nothing.
4,Handy gadget to have in the car,"We were originally looking for something for the passenger to read with, and this is really too bright for that. But it is handy to have in the car in case we need a brighter light to search for a dropped object."
1,should not be called a spotlight,Do not purchase this product if you are going to use it from a vehicle to see something at a distance!
2,Unbelievably sloppy editing,"I enjoyed Dietz' story, although there were a few too many miracle escapes in the plot for my taste.However, I have never read any novel, anywhere, that had even one quarter of the grammar errors and wrong word choices that this one had. I'm sure many authors make such errors, but ordinarily they are caught in editing. Not this time, they weren't. Dietz is in love with sentence fragments. One or two of those might be artistically meaningful, but there are closer to a hundred of them in the book. Twice he uses the word ""perspective"" when he means ""prospective"". I don't have it in front of me (I took it back to the library, grateful that I didn't pay for it!) or I would list some of the other problems. Potholes on an otherwise smooth road. (There, look, a sentence fragment!)"
5,"Easier than adhesive labels, in my opinion","I'm in a band, so it's really nice to have an inexpensive way of printing CD labels. And I think it looks more professional than paper adhesive labels, because you're printing directly on the disc. How easily the ink scratches off depends on your printing surface; use CDs with a nice matte finish and the ink will adhere well. I was not disappointed with the print quality; 300dpi is reasonable for this device. The ability to use True Type fonts and to preview the image is also nice. And while it has simple wizards for novices, I wasn't disappointed with the advanced layout features, such as front-to-back ordering and position locking. You could even do color graphics if you split an image into RGB separations and rotated the color ink ribbons. And it's great that the disc turns automatically to print on both sides. Overall, I think this is a great solution when you consider the costs of various CD printing options."
4,Does its job well,"I've owned this device for about six months. Out of the box I had it up and running in just a few minutes, no compatability or driver or device location problems, running Win XP, and I'm not any kind of genius with computers. The printing looks very, very nice with the unbranded Taiyo Yudins I prefer. I also like that it can work positioned either horizontally or vertically. So, basically, the CW-100 works as promised and I'm happy with it.Minus a star, however, because (1) the software interface is not as logical and easy to use as it should be when it comes to selecting font size and laying out your text (2) given that this is a single function device, it's not a great value at the presently prevailing street prices."
3,"IT WORKS, BUT GOOD LUCK.","The printer works well, but first impressions are everything. An imortant message was taped to the top of the printer with a warning message advising that; before using the printer for the first time:1. Remove the tape holding the front cover and disc tray in place.2. Remove packing material from inside the printer.What was missing from the message was ""USING THE FOLLOWING STEPS"".The steps needed to accomplish the above were included in small type. The printer must be powered up and connected to the computer before the packing material can be removed. If one forces the printer open then the printer gets a terrible review.Using the software was worse than trying to remove the packing material. Need I say more..."
3,"Casio printer very handy, but not the most intuitive","Much better than the old Sharpie, but the Casio CW-100 suffers from poor (non-intuitive) software and ribbon refills that cannot be found except online. It would be great if my local Office Depot or OfficeMax carried the ribbons, but nope--nada. Even the people at Staples that I have been to while traveling look at me like I'm insane. Otherwise, the quality of the printing on the CD-ROM is good, and the software gives you lots of choices with regard to layout and typefaces. However, the way the software orients the disk to write above or below the spindle hole is confusing and most people will give up in frustration."
2,Not as good as it should be,"I was disappointed that you need special disks, but even after that, the printing is mediocre, just below standards that is should be. The software is not that user friendly, frankly might as well stick with the black magic markers, for the money spent, a true dissapointment."
5,great machine for what it does,"when my cw-100 arrived i had problems getting it to print. turned out it was defective. i sent it back and the (new) replacement is excellent for what i need, which is, simply, to print data on dvd's and cd's. it's quick and, compared to printers, cheaper. do yourself a favor and buy the ribbons bulk. that way they'll only end up costing about $7 each (there are vendors on ebay that sell in bulk). i've found that i can get over 45 top-only prints on dvd's and cd's (3 lines at the 2 point size). and, you don't have to get special printer-compatible disks, which will also save money. all in all, a great machine for under $125 (bought it via ebay)..."
1,Sorry I bought it,Recieved it today...had to try it...unpacked and installed ok...printed first line ok..then i had to take out ink ribbon and rewind it every time for each line..ribbon seems to stick to disk..very unhappy
1,incorrectly regulated piano roll reproducing mechanism,"Not only is the toccata performed by Robert Casadesus and not by Ravel, as the recording states, but the Duo-Art rolls which were used to make this recording has been shown by historians to be _incorrectly calibrated_ (in the Ronald Woodley article in the cambrige compainion to ravel, p222) and therefore absurdly and grotesquely twisted.There are recordings available with these rolls correctly calibrated and they are *wonderful* (the ""masters of the piano roll"" cd issued recently by dal segno)[...]don't let the cheap price fool you: Ravel would be seriously angered to have this recording attributed to him."
1,Only Ravel Knew!,"There is some doubt about this ""historical"" recording. The title of the CD is ""Ravel plays Ravel"". Except what you read from the Amazon website, you couldn't find any information about the recording in the accompanying pamphlet or on the CD itself. There is no name for the orchestra that played the Bolero, you are not sure whether Ravel was the conductor to this anonymous orchestra or he was just a cymbals player sitting in the back of orchestra. For the solo piano pieces, it didn't say it was from live recordings or piano rolls. All the accompanying pamphlet said is just a brief generic biography of Ravel. Only two out of the seven works mentioned are actually on the CD.The copyright of this recording is ""1995 Delta Music"", Delta Music is a seldem heard name. The CD is issued by a truly budget label - ""Laser Light Digital"". You certainly get a bottom budget price on this CD, but whether it is historical or not? only Ravel knew!"
2,Ravel?,"The CD I got has 6 tracks, the first one being a anonymous modern orchestra playing Bolero.The other tracks are supposed to be played by Ravel, but there's no mention whatsoever of the origin or dates of the recordings. There's instead factually questionable biography. So,as far as I'm concerned, the tracks could have very well been recorded by the producer's daughter on their living room piano.There must be somewhere a more satisfying cd available!"
1,"Does not work with BLUE horns, Flammable and non returnable","Beware this is NOT for your BLUE falcon horn, they require a different refill that is NOT FLAMMABLE.USELESS. who would use a horn with highly flammable gas anyware around people!!!"
4,My Introduction to Iron Maiden!,"I first heard this record in 1985, just after its release, and it was my intorduction to Iron Maiden. I have always said that this one is my favorite, but it is possibly due to it being my ""first"" Maiden record. I also saw them on this tour when they came to South Florida, and still, I maintain that was their best tour. After Powerslave, I started to backtrack with Number of the Beast and Piece of mind, and then further into the Dianno years. I feel that Maiden as a band was better with Dianno, but it is quite clear that Dickenson is superior and this record is their highlight. Ancient Mariner is to Maiden as ""Stairway"" is to Zeppelin, of course without all the airplay. Well, Get this record of your a Maiden fan in any way, and I guarentee you won't be disappointed!"
4,Maiden Rock Intelligently,"This, Maiden's third release with singer Bruce Dickenson, is by arguably their best. By blending relevant, cogent lyrics with their most inventive guitar assaults to date, the mates from Old E have done something special here: created an album devoid of filler, crammed with instant classics. Most notable are the heavy ""Aces High"" and the little appreciated gem ""Back in the Village."" Martin Birch's let-'em-rock-till-ears-bleed production has never sounded so good."
5,PowerCD!,"""Powerslave"" was a hit from the start! With ""Aces High"", ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"", and ""2 Minutes to Midnight"", ""Powerslave"" was released at the peak of Maiden's popularity! Also Recommended: The Number of the Beast"
3,For 3 great songs,"After Iron Maiden's overall best release ""Piece of mind"", things started to go downhill. On the one hand, ""Powerslave"" includes some really great songs like the opener ""Aces high"" - a fast rocker about pilots during World War II; The slower but very captivating title track ""Powerslave"", and the ending 13 minutes (?) long ""Rime of the ancient mariner"" which is built the same way as ""Hallowed be thy name"" (from ""The number of the beast"") with it's interesting changes in tempo. Steve Harris have revisited this formula several times later but in my opinion he have never been able to come up with something that's not a (pale) copy. These 3 songs are the albums highlight. Then there's two average songs: ""2 minutes to midnight"" and ""Back in the village"", but the rest is not good at all."
5,Simply the best,This album is simply the best album of all time in the history of music. I have no more words for it.
4,A good album of Maiden but not the best,"Powerslave is a great album, but it has only 8 songs, while the 4-5 are great. The other, like ""Back In The Village"", ""Powerslave"" are not so great for Maiden. If you're a Maiden fan, buy it, but if you aren't..."
3,Somewhat lacking...,"4 good songs in it, 4 poor. Better than some other albums but much worse than Fear of the Dark, Iron Maiden, The X Factor, Virtual XI and maybe some more."
3,Pretty Good,"This has some pretty cool songs, but I think the Number of the Beast is a little better. And also, after a while they tend to sound like Judas Priest, a better band in my opinion.For some great heavy metal check out Judas Priest, (early) Metallica, and the tightest band I've ever heard, Pantera."
5,Maiden Reaches Peak,"For Me, this is the pinnacle of Maiden's success recording. This has the classic lineup and is over one hour of incredible music. From the beginning with ""Aces High"" to the epic ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" this album packs more quality riffs into 8 songs than many bands do in a lifetime. The production is excellent, the songwriting top notch and the song selection is great. Adrian and Dave are in excellent form showing us why they re-defined the twin lead guitar format. In my opinion, the title track rates as one of the bands best songs ever, Dave Murray has 2 of his best solos ever in that one. The band shows why they were at the top of the Hard Rock/Metal scene at the time and this album still rocks today as much as it did then. If you like metal and you don't own this album I highly recommend that you get this one and play it loud."
4,bloody awesome,"to""listener from philly"", this album was/is awesome. Better yet, I actually had the good fortune of going to see ""Poweslave"" the tour. By far one of the best I have ever been too. It'd be worth the price of today's concert tickets. ACES HIGH"
2,What a Let Down,"This was supposed to be Maiden's best. Well, it is not. If you want to hear Maiden truly rocking, get The Number of The Beast. If you want a real 80's metal masterpiece, get Defenders of the Faith by Judas Priest."
1,GIVE IT UP!,"This band should be called IRON BUTTPLUG. This album pretty much sums up their talent (none) and their ability to sound like they have a CD of William Tell Overture stuck up their behinds. ""Hey, look at me , I'm Steve Harris 'DUMDADADUMDADADUMDADADUMDADADUMDUM""."
5,THE BEST MAIDEN ALBUM - EVER!!!!!!!!,"This is by far my favorite Maiden album. Aces High is awesome. Losfer Words is their best instrumental. I'd have to say my favorite song is Flash of the Blade and my least favorite is 2 Minutes to Midnight, and I love even that. You gotta get the enhanced CD's - Maiden really cares about their fans. I can't wait to see the reunited Maiden!! UP THE IRONS!!!!"
4,A beautiful piece of metal history.,"This is a great album! It will make you feel like you are in ancient Egypt. Probably the best artwork EVER!!! But the music is what really matters, and this one certainly delivers! Buy it now...before its too late!!!! It makes me miss those days when I could sport a mullet with pride!"
4,Good guide,We really like that this book has photos of the trees. We would have liked a close up picture of the actual leaves too.
1,Weak,Almost completely worthless. I'll use it as a door stop and go look for a more comprehensive book with actual photos of the trees and hopefully in all four seasons.
1,Worked for about a week,"It took the gray squirrels in my backyard about a week to figure this one out. Because the baffle tips, the squirrels can hang on with their back feet and tip the thing almost vertically where they can then reach below and grab on to the cord that the feeder hangs from underneath. If the baffle didn't tip at all, or if it were wider, it would have a chance of working. As is, it's good for keeping the rain off the feeder and that's about it."
2,Nice if there is no wind,"Be very careful when buying this. I just hooked it on a pole with a bird feeder. The wind blew the cover (which pulled the feeder) off after 2 days, cracked the light plastic top, and rendered my purchase useless. Rigid, cheap plastic top, which is rather small. It does keep the rain off the feeder."
2,Nice squirrel umbrella,Fairly useless. Squirrels land on top of it and ride the tipping baffle to the feeder. Not very effective. A nice way to keep the rain off the squirrels while they eat your bird food.
3,Only partly effective,"It is fairly easy for a large squirrel to hang on to the line suspending the baffle with his hind legs, drape himself over the baffle, and reach the feeder with his mouth."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money,"Even with the adjustments suggested by other(s), this baffle poses no more than a minor inconvenience to squirrels. They are easily able to climb down it, hang off the side, and get onto the feeder below. Don't waste your money or time with this baffle. Better to spend a little more and get one that works."
3,Good try,"Good for entertainment when trying to outwit a squirrel, but not a complete solution for our beasty. This could only be a complete solution to protecting a birdfeeder for a smaller breed of, or perhaps less tenacious, squirrel."
3,Works great to keep rain off -- squirrels so -so,"I recently started birding and am now an addict.. I have 9 feeders in my front yard and sometimes I have up to 10 different types of birds at the feeders at the same time. And also several squirrels. I have purchased a number of squirrel resistant feeders which work great and purchased two of these. They do an okay job of keeping the squirrels from attacking from the top and they do a wonderful job of keeping the rain off the feeder, so that has become my primary use for these baffles."
1,Didn't even slow them down,"Might even make it easier, gives them a wider platform to jump to. It's not wide enough to keep them from reaching the feeder underneath."
1,Squirrels love these,the second day up and the squirrels have figured out how to jump on these and slide down to the bird feeder. What a waste of money
4,works good,"I didn't have too many squirrels getting into my feeder, but I did have a few that would hang down and spill all the seeds. This product has stopped them. I think they tried when I first put it up because there was spilled seeds but I'm guessing that it made them fall or made it too hard for them to get anything because they don't try anymore."
2,small & ineffective,"way too small to even keep rain off, doesn't really tip, just hangs crooked. The hanger hooks are not effective, I finally put the hanger upside down from the directions, added washer & gave up. Then I put in under an eave of the house where squirrel can't jump."
1,does not work,"The plastic ""shield"" is too small and hangs far too high up from the feeder to make it work to keep the squirrels away. Did not work at all. Am returning product since it did not do what it said it would!"
1,Didn't last for a day,"I didn't read the reviews, just went after the logic behind the product. I thought this might work. I have spent way too much time, money and effort to protect the bird feeder from these critters. After I installed it, I was laughing with an evil laugh thinking I won this time. Ha. It took these little creatures less than two hours to figure the system out. How disappointing. NOTHING STOPS THEM!!! I am giving it up and hope the birds will survive."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"I,m in the process of returning the phone.There are so many things wrong with this phone.One of the worst things is that i get this high pitched noise once in a while,then you get somewhat of an echo,then the ear section is uncomfortable.I,m going to try a sony now and i hope it works out. p.s.My 10 channel phone was 10 times better than this one"
4,Nice story about the Pilgrims,"I bought this book after learning that I was descended from two of the Hopkins family children, and wanted to learn more about their experience. The book is used, as advertised, but arrived in good condition."
2,sizes are off,"the sizes run to small. for example, my girl wheres a small size in everything and this was way to small!"
5,Fantastic Book,"I've read and re-read Bobby and his Cat and I must say, this is a story that needs to be told. Rob had written a book that fully captures the essence of childhood sexual abuse, his own incredible struggle and ultimate triumph. If you have ever been abused or know anyone who has ever been abused (I think that's every man, woman and child), then please read this book. It's a childrens book for grown ups."
5,Bobby and His Cat - an incredible book,"The language of this book are simplistic, but the concept is anything but. It is hard to find words to express feelings so deep, but Mr. Weinstein has done it so thoroughly, and movingly, that I was moved to tears."
2,Confusing...Vague....and disappointing!,"Good cast, adaptation of King Lear. Don't bother unless you are really bored."
2,sad and depressing,the two leading ladies do a great job but the film is a downer. I would rent this movie but in less you HAVE Family in this film I wouldn't buy it.
1,"Book doesn't deserve any credit, neither does movie.","While the book is definitely geared to the female gender with its horrible male characters and girls that I think are just as bad, the movie has just the same characters mulling through a landslide of disasters while continueing with their pityful lives. The book had no good characters and the movie which heavily depends on the characters certainly didn't change anything in this flop with two extraordinary actors wasting their talents."
3,"""Daddy, dearest?""",A good film driven by a rather creepy performance by Robards. Memorable.Recommended.
2,Doesn't capture Smiley's Awesome story,"Lange and Pfeiffer were well-intentioned to produce this adaptation, and their performances are fine, but it nowhere near captures the brilliant story of the book by Jane Smiley. It is reduced to melodrama, with the complexities of the characters lost for the sake of moving the film along. These complexities could well have been captured with the right direction or screenplay. Instead, it ends up with all the force and presence of a movie-of-the-week. Read Smiley's book for the real impact."
5,I have always loved this movie. I found it to be very insightful about a typical farm family. Lots of Drama!!,I chose this rating because its a very well done movie. It deserves this rating. I believe the cast was wonderful! That really added to this movie.
4,good movie,I have seen this movie a couple of times and I have to say it is a good movie. There is a lot of drama and real life stuff. It really is a good movie. I would recommend this movie to any one. It's worth watching at least once.
2,DEPRESSING!! Not at all what I thought it would be.,This was one of the most depressing movie I've ever seen. It was like that the whole way through. Even the ending was awful. I strongly recommend not seeing this movie. It would be a big waste of time.
2,"Great cast, bad movie!","As someone who grew up in Iowa, I find it almost sad that this movie is passed off as a slice of rural life. The story is a solid one, but never takes off throughout the movie. The director should have done so much more with these magnificent actors. If you're looking for a quality DVD experience, look elsewhere. This was an early release DVD with only the trailer available for extras and the Dolby Digital 5.1 is only nice during one scene."
3,Shakespeare it isn't!,"This film definitely has merit as well as an all-star cast. It may well be an updated version of King Lear, but I found the topic less than entertaining...and I was not thrilled with the ending. As for Colin Firth's performance as an American drifter... he successfully portrays a Mr. Wickham from his P&P days. He is charming, available, and easy to like ~ except he is definitely not going to be around for the duration. And what sort of cad sleeps with sisters of the same family...simultaneously?"
4,"Very Dramatic, Great Performances, & Memorable",This is one of those very dramatic dramas that seem to stay with you after you watch it. Three sisters have very conflicted feelings towards their father who is growing more and more disorientated as he ages and continues to be an alcoholic. What happened in the past to make this father resent his daughters so much and why do they feel the way they do? If you like family in distress movies then this is sure to peak your interest. Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange have a very good on screen chemistry.
5,Totally Enthralling!,I loved this book and this movie. Michelle Phiffer and Jessica Lange are a dream cast toghether and I can only hope they continue to make movies together. I cried throughout the movie and felt as if I was with them throughout their trials. Everyone needs to see this!
4,Nice RSV,"The RSV is getting harder to find, especially in a study edition. This one is from Oxford and is a nice addition to your study bible collection. I truly appreciate the RSV translation, and this bible presents it in clear, sharp print and decent paper. Oxford bibles seem to be of higher quality than most, and this one is no exception. The binding is strong and sturdy. This one is available in both the Protestant version without the Apocrypha, and one with the Apocrypha. These books are in the back of the bible after the New Testament. There is also a history of the bible section and some other interesting articles right before the Apocryphal section.The notes are somewhat liberal, although not as bad as some of the NRSV study bibles from Oxford. I do get some good things from the notes and can ignore the ones I don't agree with. I would recommend this book to RSV readers."
2,The Study Bible,"I was really disappointed in this hardcover version. Though more expensive, it is an older translation than the college edition. It does have footnotes, but they are not nearly as extensive as hoped for."
4,What I wanted but slow delivery,"This Bible seems to be the most comprehensive version of the New Revised Standard Version, which is considered by many scholars to be the best modern translation of the Holy Bible. Its commentary is thought provoking and concise. I would say, however, that this version is not for the casual reader of the Bible. A grasp of basic theology is needed to get into the commentary. As with most Study Bibles, I understand that the remarks are someone else's opinion. I purchased this Bible specifically for an Education for Ministry course I'm starting.If someone is looking for an easier to understand Bible, ""The Message"" should be more to your liking. I have both, and often refer to The Message to make sure I'm understanding the meaning of confusing passages.I would have rated this product as 5 stars were it not for the absurdly long time it took this product to come from the vendor in South Carolina to me. If you want this product, I would recommend using a different vendor."
5,A very worthy study Bible,"This is probably, at least at the time of this writing, the most useful study Bible. This copy of Holy Scripture contains all the books generally found in the Septuagint (LXX) Old Testament. This translation respects the traditional language, and usage of language, that is sadly lost with the earnest attempts of the NRSV to be ""gender inclusive"", but creates confusion rather than inclusiveness. The RSV is written with the scholar and student in mind, not the agenda (sincere as it is) that actually detracts from the later NRSV. The notes are useful, the language, while not the masterpiece of the English language that is the King James, is still reverential and appropriate."
4,an excellent Bible,"This Bible should be on every Christian's book shelf. It contains the most extensive canon of Scripture as accepted in the Eastern Churches. The RSV is also the finest english translation of Scripture to date (unfortunately the NRSV is quirky in some places and makes excessive use of inclusive language). The introductions and notes are, for the most part useful, but do represent a slight liberal protestant bias (see for example the notes on John 6). Also, the DeuteroCanonical books are included in an appendix in the back and should be either placed between the two testaments or in canonical order. Nevertheless, this is the most ecumenical edition of the Bible available in a translation that is liturgically acceptable to Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox. I would use this Bible along with the New Jerusalem Bible."
5,Should have been my 1st Study Bible,"This should have been my very first Study Bible. The RSV translation, notes and the Apocrypha makes studying the Bible an enjoyable experience."
5,A Beautiful useful Study Bible.,Print is clear and easy to read and the leather binding is beautiful! Bible contains study hints and a lot of additional information in the back. There is no red lttering in the New Testament but I always found that distracting. I purchased this for a EfM course and it came highly recommended by the advance students and the instructor.
5,A MUST HAVE for the serious Biblical Student!,"I have several Bibles and this one is - by far - my absolute favorite. The RSV translation is extremely accurate and contains no denominational bias. They stuck to translation accuracy over evangelical necessities. They maintain the beauty of the KJV and really only updated language, consulted more accurate manuscripts, and constructed a more modern literary flow. The study helps provide clarity on translation questions and background data rather than giving you someone else's interpretation of what is being said. The Bible can speak for itself, you do not need someone else's commentary to make sense of it (I am not a fan of ""Study Bibles""). It also contains all known Apocryphal texts which I have found to be tremendously valuable in my studies.A must have for anyone serious about Biblical Studies."
5,This book makes us all look smarter,"During our daily lives, we all do embarrassing things that we hope no one will find out about. But let's hope they are quite as bad as Chester! It's like watching a rerun of Lucy! You know Chester is in for it, you just don't know how and why. This is an affordable and very funny book right in time for Christmas. I laughed out loud during the book but especially at the mouse story for which the book was named. What a great stress releaver! We just know we aren't as dumb as Chester - or are we?"
2,More than You Want to Know,"I couldn't get through this book. Too much detail about characters I couldn't get to care about. The ""Crazies"" are not funny, the others not appealing. I also read Bausch's ""Peace"" and there, too, found way too much detail - not interesting detail, just detail for its own sake, apparently. I skipped sections in ""Peace,"" because the core of the story is interesting, but I skipped the whole second half of ""Thanksgiving Night."" Bausch makes some good observations and similies. He has skill, but he needs to know when enough is enough."
2,Depressing,I kept thinking the story line would take a more positive spin but it was so depressing. Not worth buying.
4,Worthwhile,"This book is well-written with memorable characters, if a bit long. The lead character, Will Butterfield, is a bit of a schlump, and none of the characters is 100% sympathetic. I did feel that the story moved along well, smoothly integrating a large cast of characters. The writing is way above average, very lyrical at times. It just seems to bog down a bit in the last third of the book, so it was something of a relief to finally get to the finish line."
2,leftist agenda,"why doesn't anyone write good fiction anymore? why is everything I read pushing an anti-Catholic/anti-Christian,pro-socialist ,leftist agenda?? I would like to escape from all the politics for awhile,okay?? I can get the same rants from Washington Post/N.Y.Times/New Yorker,etc.ad nauseum..I just want to read a good book! I know we're supposed to hate Nixon & Ken Starr;I know we're supposed to think Christianity is stupid..I get enough of that from the mainstream press. Bausch is preaching to his own secular,Trotsky-rules, choir..of course all the characters have money..helps,doesn't it?even tho'capitalism is so evil..would've enjoyed this book,without it's blatant political message"
3,"House of pain, House of mystery","Something I feel an author writes a book that means something only to them, something only they can completely understand.Perhaps I was expecting something along the line of HOUSE OF SPIRITS by Isabelle Allende, because while I felt this book started out potential, I completely lost interest halfway through, (but I did listen to the end).The descriptive process in the book was excellent. I actually got a perfect flavor of the time, the food and the people who seemed to want to stay within the confines of their own hearts and minds.I read some of the other reviews and am happy that most found this a fascinating tale.I unfortunately did not. Don't get me wrong, it had interesting points but I felt the story line dragged and never gave me the ending I wanted.."
4,Luvie Giraffe,"My oldest has one of these, and after our move I couldn't find it! We had to get two more, one for him and one for his baby ""brubber"". They LOVE them and cuddle up to them every night!"
5,"My favorite ""90's"" album...","After much debate, this one gets the crown. In the early-mid 90's there were tons of crap alt/pop bands out there to choose from. The sad thing is, The Breeders often get mixed into that sort of artsy fartsy chick rock thing, and they are anything but that.From beginning to end, this cd rocks. There are a few quick to the punch power jams, and a few you will recognize, (ie: Cannonball) but the best thing about this cd are the unknown songs like ""I Just Wanna Get Along,"" ""Divine Hammer,"" and""Driving on 9,"" the last of which is a cajun-style country rock ballad that will blow your mind.In short, I don't recommend this cd to just anyone...but if you want to remember that aspect the 90's, Last Splash will take you back there in a hurry."
3,Decent alternative fare,"Released as it was during the onslaught of alternative music upon the mainstream in 1993, this album has the feel of a one time knock-off. Much of what is here is decent, but not memorable. ""Cannonball"" was the over-played hit. Better tracks include ""Mad Lucas,"" ""Divine Hammer,"" and ""Drivin' on 9."" But overall there is nothing here that other female-led bands of the era, like Throwing Muses, the group the Breeders most resemble, didn't do better."
2,Not very listenable today,"Back in the day, this was very popular. Not many people are driving around with this in their cd player today. It sounds dated.However, ""Cannonball"" is a classic. This band just happened to stumble on a genuine, ""Louie, Louie"" type of song.""No Aloha"" is interesting (sounds very Pixie ish), ""Divine Hammer"" is decent and ""Driving on 9"" is a cool, trucker vibe of a song.The rest of this is pretty unlistenable."
4,Close but no cigar,"A very very good album, that I have had since 1993. A more poppy, upbeat, fun album from Kim Deal and ""the gang"" though I still miss the Pixies. Most memorable songs on this CD are Divine Hammer (full of dirty dirty innuendo, gotta love it), Saints (my personal sing-a-long favorite, I also do an A+ air guitar), Cannonball (excellent track, very catchy, stays in your head), I Just Wanna Get Along (kinda mad, I find it's almost like Kim is going insane here), Roi (A hypnotizing near-instrumental track with a kind of surf-ish feel to it) and New Year (another great catchy fun song to sing along with in a convertable). This is a summer CD by the way. Don't listen to it near snow, it just ruins the fun."
3,"a good, if not indispensible album.","Kim Deal, of the Pixies, lends an interesting mood to this album; it can't quite decide if it wants to be pop, grunge, or electro-punk; so, it decides to be a little bit of each. Sometimes it fails, ""Roi"", sometimes it succeeds, ""Drivin' on 9 (a superior cover of an ed's Redeeming Qualities song (one of my favorite bands)), and Cannonball; sometimes it surprises ""Invisible Man"". However, the single most beautiful song on this album is unquestionably ""Mad Lucas"".. brilliant, sad, disturbing, and like nothing I've ever heard. One of my favorite songs, period. If nothing else, buy Last Splash for this song.. you can get it cheaply enough now, that's for sure. Make sure to pick up the cannonball single, also... 900 is the Breeder's second best song ever, next to Mad Lucas, and available only on that single, if I'm correct."
3,"Bizarre Bollywood fantasy epic, originally in 3-D .","This was a big hit in India upon first release in 1984, as it was reportedly the first 3-D movie released there. In 1988, much of the film was reshot and new sequences added, and it enjoyed new success. It's this revamped version that is featured on the DVD release, however, it is presented in flat 2-D form only, robbing the film of it's only real asset. The DVD is widescreen and English subtitles are an option, though I can't say they made the film any easier to follow!"
5,LOVE IT,it was the right amount to spray my whole display board for my science fair project. i love the color and will be buying it again in the future if i ever do science fair projects again.
1,"dries soft, gummy, chewy","Dries soft, gummy, chewy - not at all like any laquer I've used!!I was expecting acrylic laquer, this stuff is chalky, reminds meof interior house paint. Bought 5 cans, used one, now I'm stuckwith 4 cans of useless aerosol paint. Live and learn."
3,Not a 6 pack. Lacks fan nozzle of Deft product.,"When I bought this product, the description said ""6-pack"". After I posted this review, this seems to have been corrected. In case the old description comes back: you only get one bottle.My other comment is that Deft sells a similar product, at similar cost, but with a nozzle that produces a fan-shaped spray, which spreads out the lacquer is very helpful for covering large flat areas. If you are spraying even moderately large objects, (e.g. furniture) I would recommend the Deft product over this one."
4,Clear and controlled,"The spray was really great, and is completely clear so that you don't see any spots where you have have missed or put too thick of a layer. I used this to protect hand-made coasters, and so far they are not being damaged by any liquids or handling."
4,Michael Flatley,This show is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It turned out to be a great gift for someone who is interested in dance and performance arts.
3,sounds of lead....,"feet of flames......sound quality of lead ! recording of this could have been much better....have heard the other productions with m. flatley, and the hard shoe ""tapping"" comes through much clearer....on ""feet of flames"" alas...the hard shoe sounds like has been dulled and muted in many of the sequences. for some reason, my old vhs version has better sound quality than the dvd......"
1,Very bad!!!,"Folks, if you've seen the ""Lord of the dance"" never buy this one. It is the same show only on a different stage. Michael Flatley and the others are like big, fat pigs. They hardly move, with heavy breathing etc. I have all Flatley's and Riverdance's records and considered myself a big fan of them, but now - Thanks! Riverdance is great, Flatley sucks! Do not buy it!"
2,Remake of Lord of the Dance,"There's one critical piece of information missing on this video's description -- this is a remake (a very bad one at that) of Lord of the Dance. I thought Flatley had produced a brand new show; little did I know. Having watched Lord of the Dance just a few months ago, the basic story line and choreography was still fresh in my mind. As soon as the first dancers came out on the stage I knew it looked familiar. Yes, the costumes are new (I didn't say better), the set is bigger (I didn't say better again), the music has been reworked, and the crowds are larger, but it is still basically Lord of the Dance. What happened? He had a good thing going and had to ruin it. I agree with others that this reminds me of a Las Vegas review, not a program highlighting traditional Irish dancing. Flatley's a good dancer, but has an ego that exceeds his talent. My recommendaton: Don't waste your money. See River Dance, see Lord of the Dance, and stop there."
3,"Ok, Not Great.","Of course Michael Flatley is brilliant and there's no debating that. What I didn't like was the theme throughout this production ie: good spirit vs bad. Also, there was a departure from traditional Irish dancing and the thing that was most disappointing was all the seduction which didn't have to be. I thought I could buy this for my parents to watch as they love music and dancing and am now glad I watched it first. Sorry, not going to agree with the reviews on this. I prefer what I saw on stage last year 100 times over. The singing was absolutely beautiful however."
5,BRILLANT,"This video is absolutely amazing!The music is absolutely wonderful! Michael Flately is once again a genius;every move they make is beautiful. Go out and get it,you'll love it."
5,"all shows beautiful,but one to be remembered","very shortly,I am a Michael flatley fan,but I must say that he will never be as ""grand""than in reverdance;younger,but upon all,maybe not yet so full of his own glory;and the sobriety of the dance and costumes added to the beauty and the magic. in his other shows(lord of the dance,feet of fires)that I love really,the excess of light effects,and colors,may be does not help as much as it could do.difficult to see sometimes. all in all anyway,all these dance shows are unique and exceptionnal and magic."
4,Flatley shows his age,Although the overall show is quite good it is obvious to those of us familiar with the original LOTD video that Michael has slowed down considerably over the last two years. If you study the two videos closely notice how more sure-footed he is in LOTD. In Feet of Flames there are times that he looks unsteady on his feet and can actually be seen taking rests while the other dancers are pounding away. It looks to me that he has put on a few pounds and his heart may not be in dancing anymore. The remaining dancers are as good or better as they were in the original video and the new numbers and restructuring of the old numbers are a noticeable improvement so the video is definitely worth having.
4,The more improved video of Lord Of The Dance...but is it?,"The Feet of Flames video is the ultimate concert video! The colors, sound and camera angles are almost to perfection. The much hated rapid-cutting which was used in the LOTD video is cut down! BUT, after viewing several times, you will begin to notice there is still the use of too many rapid cuts! However, face expressions and atmosphere are captured perfectly! All the material which was occuring during the night is on the video, which is the big bonus! It's definitely two hours of magic and heart pounding excitement which takes you into the outstanding dreams of Michael Flatley!!!"
2,Meh,"Bought this for my dad for Christmas since he loved Riverdance, Lord of the Dance. I was disappointed, it was very much like Lord of the Dance and the spirit of the Irish dance that was there for Riverdance was not there for me. Very showy. Michael Flatley had to have it be the biggest outdoor event EVER and in Hyde Park no less. So for me the focus seemed to be on how outrageously huge it could be with the set and the number of dancers. Most of the numbers we had seen before, some new ones added including the finale by Michael which frankly didn't wow me. Overall, felt like I had already seen it. Also did not appreciate the sexuality that has been added. The talented dancers carry the show, not the sex."
2,Could do with a little less DRAMA,I was very disapointed with this video... When I saw Riverdance I could not take my eyes off the TV....it was captivating. When viewing Feet of Flames I found myself forwarding the tape to get past the ridiculous drama that they seem to feel is necessary.... I found the eruptions of applause whenever FLatley appeared to be excessive... I wish they would stick to dancing w/minimal story plots that seem to be written to stroke Flatley's ego. Alot like watching the old silent movies with their exaggerated gestures. I never even finished the tape... I put it in with the other discards that goodwill is picking up this week.
2,Feet of Ashes!,Hang it up Michael- you're not the best dancer that ever existed (as you proclaimed yourself). It's too bad that your ego has produced yet another over the top too much for our own good video of your Irish taps! PLEASE enough already!
5,Dancin,"Bought this for a family that had never seen a Michael Flatley performance. The family loved it. For myself I think this DVD captures his best performance beautifully. If you like his stly of Irish dancing, you will love this."
5,His best ever,"I agree this is Michael Flatley's finest. I saw Lord of the Dance live and it could've lasted for years and still been over too soon, but Feet of Flames surpasses anything he has ever done. My only complaint is the soundtracks aren't live recordings and don't include the dancing sounds!"
3,Don't bother,"I own Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, and Feet of Flames. I Must say Feet of Flames was a waste of money, Thank goodness it was a gift.If you own Lord of the Dance, Don't bother buying Feet of Flames! Its the same show, Yes there's a few differences there.1) its an outdoor concert, 2) 2 New Songs/Dances, and thats pretty much about it.I really think they lost what they were trying to achive."
2,he needed to retire.,"Flatley looks tired and well past his prime in this version of LOTD. All the intrusive editing cannot hide the fact that he never once looks like the best dancer on the stage. His steps are sloppy, mushy, and flat-footed...when he's even dancing at all. Mostly he just hams it up in front while a stagefull of talented young dancers do what he just can't seem to manage anymore. He does play the flute in a couple of numbers, and he's not bad at all...but did you really buy this video to see him play the flute? The ""Feet of Flames"" solo near the end is just not worth the wait. It's just a few flurries of tapping in between ""aw shucks"" nods at the audience, and in it he does moves that were done far better by Maria Pages and Colin Dunne in the second Riverdance video. Flatley was great in the first LOTD, but I think you'll be disappointed with this."
3,"Michael, Lose Some weight...","Feet of Flames is a very good production, much better than LOTD. The sets are better, the camera work is improved and the dancers are also very good. However, Michael is not as good as he was in LOTD. He is over-weight and cannot do the high kicks he did in previous productions. He was slower and tried to make up for it with herky-jerky movements. The outfits he wore could not hide the ""love handles"" and the extra weight he was packing. Another thing that puzzles me, what was the ""crawling"" thing. He did it twice. Not good. Also the hat was a mistake. I see all of the 5 star reviews and I have to ask, Do I have the same tape they do."
2,Feet of Flames Falls Flat,"The quality of this video approaches ""amateur home movie"" - many shots are blurry, especially as night falls and the lights glare into the camera. There are just as many interrupting cut-aways and slow motion shots as in Lord of the Dance, but at least with Lord of the Dance the camera was in focus all the time. There are also a LOT of long-distance shots from the back of the audience...like watching dancing ants. It was nice seeing the additional acts, and the changes in choreography, but overall a very disappointing video. Lord of the Dance is a much better buy in my opinion."
2,"Lord of the, oh I mean Feet of Flames.","This should be titled Lord of the Dance not feet of flames. The two shows are almost identical. If youv'e seen Lord of the dance then you have seen Feet Of Flames. There are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff. My biggest gripe is that Flatley seems way to full of himself in this one! I mean he is so in love with himself its anoying! I truely enjoyed his dancing in the original Riverdance filmed in Ireland, but id say after watching Feet of Flames he deserved getting bagged on by Mike Meyers!!! The sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show, and it reminds me more of Vegas show than anything else. Can someone please knock some sense into Flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door. That way I can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego!"
2,Feet of Flames goes down in Flames,"Did anyone else notice that he seemed to kiss and flirt more then he danced? Get a room already! Doesn't he have any other time to do that! Oh and also how come michael flathead gets all the money when he just waves his hands around tapes twice and then he goes kiss some one, those other people tap 100% more then him, so he should get way less money then them. The only reason i'm giving it two stars is because of the bad guys, kick ....!! I also think that the costumes for the bad guys were better and that is about it. Also during the finale michael flathead stood infront of the Dark Lord, uh he did way better then you so let him show, but hey that is my opion!"
1,The Ego has landed,"The Ego has landed - on his face. Flatleys posturing, costumes, makeup and the name ""Feet of Flames"" are ludicrous, completely laughable. It would have been better called Dance of the Dork."
5,Everything you could ask for in a video!,"I loved ""Lord of the Dance"" the first time I watched it. So naturally, I was exploring other videos done by Michael Flatley and I came across and purchased ""Feet Of Flames."" This is Lord of the Dance taken to the next level!! The dancing is much faster and the music is great! It was also a clean, clear picture and not constant camera angle switches like in LOTD. With the returning lead roles and a massive group of dancers, Michael Flatley hits the enormous stage with a show that surely will take your breath away, and leave you in a state of astonishment! I Highly recommend Feet of Flames and Lord of the Dance for great entertainment that any age will enjoy!"
3,Great Dancing but the costumes!,I do love the dancing but I have to say I found the costumes of the production much gaudier and less atractive than the first version. The taping is better but the show looks sooo tacky at points it was laughable. I'm not apurist I love the show and I have been an Irish dancer for about 15 years. At one point the gypsy girl comes out in this god awful red cat suit looking like some villinous from the 1960's Batman TV series..very tacky. And Dair Nolan looked like he hated wearing that ridculous cape! As a dancer what idiot would want to dance with a cape flapping about your body? I do prefer this tape to the Orginal LOTD but I still think Flatley needs to work on his costume ideas. I have done dance shows and you need to not make the costumes so flashy that it ditracts from the lovely dancing. He needs to TONE IT DOWN!
5,BEST SHOW I have ever seen..,"I have seen LORD OF THE DANCE live 6 times, and loved the video, but was disappointed with the numbers missing from the video. FEET OF FLAMES has it all..the ""flute jam"" (the band with Michael playing flute ) which I love, and much better camera work. Michael was great! The new costumes and numbers were a wonderful addition. The encore was magnificent and energizing! Anyone who mounted this show, and the others, would never have been able to make them without great confidence in himself, which some attribute to an inflated ego. I met Michael backstage in Philadelphia and was very impressed by his warmth, friendliness and charisma. I wish everyone would see this show, it is a joy to behold."
5,Absolutely fantastic variation of LOTD,"I thoroughly enjoyed this variation of LOTD.The dancers, musicians, and singer all seemed to be having fun while doing their numbers. My favorite example is the great Gillian Norris performing "" Gypsy "" You could see her beautiful face and smile. She seemed to be having a great time while being erotic as she danced.Also her "" Fiery Nights "" number was excellent ( including the outfit).Bernadette Flynn's dance numbers were also superb. Again the dances were the same as LOTD, however again there seemed to be more sexual energy and passion in her dances. Anne Buckley's songs were sung like a angel from Heaven. The 2 fiddler players were superb as they were in LOTD'Michael Flatley did not do as many dance numbers as before but was his usual flamboyant self.I recommend this show to anyone who likes to watch, fantastic Irish step dancing, beautiful Irish women, Celtic music, good choreography, Great sets and lighting."
5,Feet of Flames is too hot to handle,"Watching Feet of Flames and seeing Michael Flatley proform his magic was absoulutly breathtaking. It was bigger and better than ever. It was a wonderful way for him to go out with a bang as he is retiring. I loved it and I recommend it to everyone from those who are just learning about the Lord of the Dance and Michael Flatley, to the avid fan. It made me tap my feet more than once."
2,To a degree I think if was informative.,I found some of this informative and some I already knew. I think this info should be out there for the less informed. j
2,Narcissistic Memoir,This book was a narcissistic memoir about the exploits of the author and her boyfriend. Nothing new and not even very interesting. Not recommended.
1,The Sex Life of Joan,"Please save your money. This book was not written well, was not particularly entertaining or informative. It was a too personal look at the author's sex life. She mentioned her boyfriend, now fiance, is a private person. She certainly did not have any respect for him at all."
1,Left liberal book did not help.,"If a person is very very liberal, this book may not be troublesome for that person. I tend to be conservative, so I did have trouble with this book. I was just about to turn 60 when I ordered this book. I was worried about my age, etc. I didn't need to worry about that, or anything else. Some experts say that late middle-age ends at 70 years old. Example: ""Late Middle Age: (Ages 55 to 70). For other experts that age may be later on. This book did not help me. I feel that some of this book goes against God's will."
3,"it's okay, but ....","It's okay as far as laminator's go, but I still had to plug it in and wait a few minutes before using it. I need immediate gratification, and didn't really get it here. I like that it doesn't get hot, though -- that's a real plus. But otherwise, it s just okay. Nothing bad, nothing good. It gets the job done, though. Is there any product out there that doesn't have to use any electricity? I'm concerned about safety issues."
2,Not for business cards,"Despite what the box says, I've had lots of problems with this product when laminating small-sized business cards and photos. I've wasted *lots* of the laminating ""film"" trying to get it to work on small items, and am preparing to return this item. Larger items come out very nicely however, so it might work better for other users."
2,"So-so, but then...","When I got this it worked OK and gave me B- type results. That's fine, because I was just using it around the house for miscellaneous stuff so I didn't need quality. Then, after only 3 months, *poof*, no power. The unit is dead. Too much hassle to go through Brother Inc. for warranty (pay S & H charges, wait 3 lifetimes to get it back refurbed, etc.)."
5,You won't be disappointed,"Except for an occasional lapse in between changing out rolls (I use two sizes) which result in my forgetting exactly how to feed the plastic into the machine, I have been very satisfied with this laminator. Works exactly as advertised. I don't recall seeing any directions specific to using two sheets of paper, but I put in two sheets of paper and laminated a two-sided sheet of paper."
1,Not for Professional Photo Qualtiy Lamination,"I had to bring mine back the same day. Lamination Inkjet prints results in thousands of tiny tiny bubbles, visible only close-up, not from 3 feet away. But The image contrast is thereby ruined, and closeup viewing will reveal the horrable quality. For Inkjet Photo lamination only HOT lamination will do a perfect job, but that requires a photo quality HOT laminator."
3,Great...until...,This book is a great story...like a grandmother telling you about her life. HOWEVER...I would strongly suggest skipping the last 25 pages. I finished the book in disgust...the rest is great.
2,Maria von Trapp: A Portrait in Self-Contradiction,"How do you know when Maria von Trapp is not lying? It is simple. When her lips are not moving. In her first book, written in 1949, she tells of the time she met the Captain and the children for the first time. She describes a scene that is very similar to the scene in the play and in the movie. She even mentions that the Captain used a whistle to call the children.In this book, she states that the Captain was not at home when she arrived, and that Baroness Matilda introduced the children to her.Hoping that no one will notice her contradictory lies, she blames the producers of the play for (falsely) portraying her husband as a stern disciplinarian. Well, give me a break. It was her 1949 book, telling of the whistle, that gave them the idea. There is also a chapter in the 1949 book about ""the baron doesn't want it.""So, she invents the story, and then blames us for believing it."
4,The album that never was and probably never will be......,"Like the previous reviewer already stated this is a mixed bag of Dave written and sung Kinks tracks, solo-singles and one obscure track.Still missing are I'm Crying, Are You Ready Girl? and Do You Wish To Be A Man. And there are still very nice mono and/or stereo versions of all known tracks available.The 4 stars are for the effort of putting a nice set together but I would have given 5 stars if the abovementioned tracks had been added to the set.For Kinks fans who would like to comment about me ommitting Groovy Movies from my list should note that this track has come available on disc 3 of the Kinks ""Village Green Preservation Society"" Deluxe Edition:-)"
4,"Well, not really a solo album","This is a collection of the various singles, Kinks album tracks and various odds and ends that Dave had original intended to be his first solo album. That didn't happen. This is essentially a Kinks album focusing on Dave's early compositions.All of these tracks are available on various compilations, Kinks albums, etc. so I wouldn't bother buying this if you have those."
4,GREAT for a preggy woman and a non-preggy woman too!,"I used this in the last months of pregnancies and I love it! The only problem is that the parts that you use (between the legs, under your head) gets a little soft overtime, like any normal pillow. Also, when you want to turn to the other side in the middle of the night, you have to basically get up and flip yourself and the entire pillow over which is a pain since you're so huge...... Overall, I still recommend it for a preggy lady.. or not!"
4,A Satisfying Completion!,"Bravo! Well done! The author's witty and entertaining sense of humor comes through so well in the characterizations and descriptions throughout. Her style of expression is so like Jane Austen's! Prior to reading it, though, one must have already read the 11 chapter fragment that Jane Austen left behind since this book does not include that text. It picks up precisely where Jane Austen left off. Ms. Shapiro succeeds in remaining faithful to the expectations of Austen fans, and now can start gathering fans of her own!"
5,Great Toy,"ExoBonz rocks. You can make lobsters (with claws that open and close), spiders with bendable legs, grasshoppers and beetles with movable wings. The best part is you can combine and create your own. My kids play with this set for hours. I highly recommend any of the Bonz toys."
2,Good idea but poor quality,This toy is a good idea but quality is poor. My daughter got it for Christmas and loved it - until the pieces started breaking the next day. We have had the toy 2 weeks and three pieces are now broken. My daughter did not throw the pieces - just put them together and played.
2,It doesnt work,"Can you imagine that Sharper Products sent me an e mail to ofered me a refund if i remove my feedback?My steamer was a money lost because doesnt remove wringles as they said, i am very dissapointed with but i also learned that i wont never buy any product from this seller: sharper products."
3,Great Expectations,"An American dream release in a same-gender-attracted dancer's case: one works hard to make it in a show-business with no protectors-or they were left outside a curtain?Some laugh through tears, some monologues on boy-seek-boy issues, some nice music-and a bit dancing, of course.It is better than many other movies on analogue topics."
1,Just unfunny enough to be believed,"With a brilliant comic premise that sounds like an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, this film fails to deliver laughs at any juncture. It passes up so many opportunities to deliver the goods.In the world of the Mocumentry, Christopher Guest always delivers with a genuine affection for his characters, besides the humor. That is missing here. What we get is a sniveling, unfunny little weasel, who is painful to watch, unlike Larry David or his Seinfeld ego, George Costanza. There is no character development here at all. The script meanders and just leaves one with the purposelessness of this production.To see a truly funny mocumentary, rent any of the Guest films, Guffman, Best in Show or Mighty Wind, for a funny and amusing gay oriented film, try Mambo Itialino. I have had a hope that gay themed films would have come farther by now than this tripe."
5,Excellent and Challenging Read,A really excellent read for those wanting to challenge and explore racial lines and history in the US. Highly recommended.
5,Wen just keeps on getting better and better!,"Wen Spencer's writing grows with each book. I got home yesterday after 8 days away to find my copy of Bitter Waters waiting for me. Finished it at 7 AM this morning. (Yawn!)It is absolutely amazing to see how well her writing improved from Alien Taste (pretty darn good) to Tainted Trail (yep, not a one book wonder) to Bitter Waters. This is a mature writer working here! And she's still eligible for the John W. Campbell Award in 2003 for Best New Writer!!! She ought to win hands-down.The ability Wen have manifested to climb into the heads of some very strange people (like Rennie, or even _Hex_) is terrific. Few SF writers write believable aliens, fewer still write believable human interactions with aliens from the alien point of view.Bravo!Buy this book. Better yet, buy Alien Taste and Tainted Trail and lose a weekend reading them all in sequence...."
4,An inventive thriller,"In this third book in the series, Ukiah Oregon is still reeling from his discovery about his alien origins and from his son's creation, and he finds himself put to the test when he becomes involved in searching for some missing children. His reputation as the Wolf Boy continues to make his life and his detective partner Max's life a challenge, and a government agent is suspicious about their connection to a strange cult. Luckily Ukiah's lesbian caretakers also take care of his son, so he can focus on his job. Before Ukiah can investigate this connection himself, his son is abducted and his hunting powers are put to the test. Joined by his girlfriend Indigo and his Pack brothers, Ukiah and Max try to elude the mysterious government agent and find Ukiah's son before it's too late. Although it's rather heavy with plot elements, ""Bitter Waters"" is a captivating thriller with a variegated cast and starring one of the more intriguing characters in fiction."
5,The best of the series... so far,"I just finished and... WOW, it deserves more than 5 stars! Wen Spencer has officially made my list of automatic ""must-have for the keeper-shelf"" authors. She weaves complex characters and intricate plot details to create a world that is at once wildly fantastic and utterly realistic. This series has it all: good and evil, love and hate, individuality and hive minds, mysteries and clues, death and immortality, decency and depravity. Did I mention aliens, bikers, the FBI, way-cool tech toys, big guns, cool cars, Kevlar and a quest to save the human race? You simply MUST read this book - but read Alien Taste and Tainted Trail first. There are enough back-story explanations in Bitter Waters, that it could probably pass on it's own, but you'll enjoy it more if you've read the first two books."
4,OLDER---BUT---VERY GOOD BOOK,"I, PROBABLY, READ THIS 20 YEARS AGO. FOUND IT ON MY """"KEEPER""""SHELF. RE-READ IT AGAIN. SAME VERY GOOD BOOK. MIGHT, JUST MIGHTSHOW SOME SIGNS OF AGING---BUT---THE STORY IS STILL VERY MEANINGFULLAND THOUGHT PROVOKING. SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ALL!!!"
5,Best text available. Has no competition.,"This text sets the standard for future information retrieval texts and has replaced the Salton books as the canonical academic text.The second edition is highly readable and contains a thorough updating of the algorithms and data structures in the field.I like the text because of its readability, conciseness, thoroughness, and attention to detail. The comparisons of algorithms on realistic sized collections is unparalleled in other texts.I have used this text for the past 5 years in a graduate level information storage and retrieval class but I believe it has a much wider audience due to the quality of writing.Additionally, the free availability of the mg system which implements many of the best algorithms of the text allows the reader/student to take advantage of the technology without having to start from scratch.Highly recommended."
5,Amazing dictionary,"Many years ago when I started learning Japanese I bought this dictionary. One of the best decisions I ever made.Nowadays I have programs on my computer to write Japanese and look up characters by their radicals. It's wonderful, but even now this dictionary is amazing. When my program doesn't find something, or only shows one version of how to write a kanji, I can take out the dictionary and double check to make sure I have the right thing.It's wonderful. It's neat and organized and was easy to use even when I was first learning kanji. I'd recommend it a hundred times over."
5,It is simply superb,This book is very useful. However one needs to understand how to use it first. Other than the initial stuff it is simply superb
5,"If you will have only one kanji dictionary, get this.","I have used many Japanese dictionaries over the years, and this is by far the single most useful one for kanji. This is largely because many kanji that are frequently-used don't often occur at the beginning of a compound. So to get a picture of the usage of one of these, you need a dictionary that gives lists of compounds with the kanji in positions other than first. This is the only dictionary to do that."
5,A top-notch historical record of one war correspondent's reflection leading to WW II.,"This is ""the best"" i have personally ever read, regarding the history of developments happening in Germany that led the WW II. Shirer's description of each day's political and military developments, made a lot of sense to this reader. My hope is that the United States will not fall into a similar political trap (as set by Hitler's regime)."
5,another great read,I read RAFOTTR in the late 80s and have subsequently reread it a number of times since.I will read it again.I discovered this book whose existence who knew nothing of whilst searching on amazon.It is a great book to read if you enjoyed rise and fall.If you read RAFOTTR and loved it you will like this book.In fact i would say read it first then start on the other one.WL Shirer writes like an intelligent liberal American and citizen of the world.Unfortunately now America seems much more inward looking and less engaged with and knowledgeable of other countries which is a pity.
5,The author makes this grim story a page-turner.,William L. Shirer must be one of the very best writers of history. He makes such a detailed book interesting.
5,Fantastic !,"To get to the point, this book was spell binding, another "" insider report "" that was amazing. I'm just glad i wasn't in Mr. Shirers shoes, it was touch & go . Wish he could've remained there through out the war, but, his hands were tied by the Nazis & there's very little else he could've reported, except half truths & outright lies . Nazi Doctrine ."
5,Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941,"Very compelling book full of stories and the telling of events that took place before World War II started and what led up to such a terrible, brutal war."
4,I would recommend it to a student of the period.,"The book is an eye-witness account of the period in Germany that coincided with American isolationism as Hitler consumed Europe.The journal is told from a reporter's viewpoint; however, as the reader is clearly informed, the writings were censored by the Nazis and parts that were missing were recreated. The book is not fascinating and lacks the personal warmth that one might expect from a journal, but I enjoyed the insider's view into German fanaticism in contrast to the near inept behaviors of American and the European nations in general. I would recommend it to a student of the period."
4,Berlin Diary,Because I was too young to really be aware during the 2nd WW I have found this book to be very enlightening
5,A Wonderful Eye-opener account of the events leading to World War II,"I was not sure what this book had to offer. I must say that it drew me in right from the beginning. Shirer's account of the happenings in and around Germany is fascinating. You can feel the pulse of events before they evolved , during and after. His accounts of Chamberlain Hitler, the various presidents of the involved nations like Poland, France, Spain Czechoslovakia were so realistic. It makes one wonder how we ever won the war and how Great Britain survived. I anticipated eagerly each new day's journal events. A Great Read!!"
2,A little too egotitical,"The book was more about the author and how smart he was, how clever he was and not enough about the war or the gist of the book as advertised. didn't finish."
5,Berlin Diary,"I haven't read the Kindle version - yet. But having enjoyed the book many years ago, I can say that Shirer's commentary must remain high in the commentators of the time. I will do a review after I have read it again."
3,a little slow,"this was difficult to get into , quite slow, pretty boring considering where he was when can't say that I would recommend!"
5,The Team That Couldn't Lose,"I got this book for my 9 year old grandson who happens to bedyslexic but is also an absolute fanatic about football!He is reading it and loving it! I am THRILLED to have found thesebooks that are so enticing they will make even a strugglingreader want to read them. Thank YOU , Matt Christopher, forunderstanding what will motivate a young boy to read!"
4,Awesome!,"The Team That Couldn't Lose by Matt Christopher is a very interesting book. The characters are Coach Kash, Chip Chase, and the rest of the Cayugans football team. Mr. McFall, an old player who played 60 years ago, has lost his old playbook because his wife sold it. A boy named Danny Livenmore bought it, and was sending plays to the Cayugans.This book is a must read! It has a good author because he is a very young sports writer. He will probably have some good books in the future.Matt Christopher is a former sports magazine seller. Also he worked at General Electric. And is a young sports writer for kids. Keep an eye out for more books by Matt Christopher."
5,Anne and Todd McCaffrey books,Todd McCaffrey books are great! I recommend them highly to anyone looking for a great story that's easy to understand. He is the best choice for following in his mothers (Anne McCaffrey) footsteps writing about the Dragon Riders of Pern.
4,Not bad :),"I love Ann Mccaffferys books on pern and wondered if this one, written by her son, could match up. I can say it has, I loved it."
3,Who did the research for this story?,"You know I love Pern. I want to go there. But,I could have written a better book on it than this one. Are we sure Todd is his mother's son? It keeps saying how he grew up with Pern in his blood, but he seems to forget a lot of Pern details for his own books. Let someone else write them. I want the real Pern and people back!"
3,Dragonsblood,"Past and present meet in this novel of Pern's distant past. Long before Lessa made her historic leap between to the past, Lorana, another Weyrwoman, sought aid from Pern's founding mothers who were long dead in her era. To stop a plauge, much like the one detailed in Moreta, Lorana looks to the past where Windblossom, one of the women who helped colonize the planet, faced much the same thing. In both eras, the planet faces extinction, not so much from Thread as from disease.*** It is often stated in the series that it is difficult for one person to live in two times, it's hard on the reader as well. With each chapter, one must reorient themselves to what the setting is. However, the junior McCaffrey does show promise. Though Lorana lacks the vibrance of Lessa or Moreta, and any book without the MasterHarper seems deficient, there is much reason to hope that a series that had begun to sag has found new life. ***"
4,Good book with some gaps,"I am a long-time fan of the Pern series and this was definitely a book worth reading. I enjoyed the plot line and character development. It answered several questions raised by previous books, such as ""What happened to the fire lizards?"". However, Todd is not Anne and there are some weak points that a more experienced author would probably have addressed. There were places where the story seemed to have a gap. We were left at the end of a chapter wondering how a character recovered from a traumatic incident. While the jump from near-death to health was jolting, the information was not necessary to the storyline. It was, however, frustrating. In similar situations, Anne filled in what had happened either at the beginning of the next chapter or in someone's remembrance, Todd leaves it empty so the reader is left somewhat unfulfilled. If you are a Pern lover, you can enjoy the book anyway."
2,Pern is dying and Todd is killing it,"I love the Pern books. Anne writes characters you care about. I have cried more than once at the death of one of them. Todd writes shallow boring characters impossible to be the least bit interested in. His plots are unintersting. I will never buy a book he has written again. I might keep reading to see if he improves, but i'll get them at the library. Don't waste your money!"
1,A disappointment,"I started reading Anne McCaffery when I was 12 when I picked up The White Dragon, and fell in love. I've read and re-read the series and have never lost my enjoyment or love for what she's created. When I heard that her son had continued the series I decided to give it a go and picked up Dragonsblood. The main character is a classic Mary Sue. She has no faults, amazing powers, and what not. The deaths of the dragons are treated in an offhand manner. It bends the rules and plot lines made by Anne McCaffery, it's poorly written in my opinion with the same phrases used and reused constantly. I actually couldn't finish it, and trust me I've read a LOT of horrible things before, but I couldn't. If you love Anne McCaffery's series, then read it and reread it. Don't pick these books up, they're not only a waste of money it genuinely makes me wince when compared to his mother's works."
1,Disappointing.,"After a lifetime of picking up every Pern book I could find, I've finally reached the end. I started with DragonSinger when I was 9 years old, and even into the later books (which were somewhat irritating for me) I still was an avid reader.Todd McCaffrey has cured me of this. His books are inconsistent, boring, and have little bearing on the Pern I grew up with. If he cannot be bothered to read his mother's books, he shouldn't sit down to write in her universe."
1,This book is SERIOUSLY flawed.,"This book is SERIOUSLY flawed. Anne would have done better to have found an accomplished writer who was familiar with her world to continue the series. It is apparent that Todd had no practical experience writing fiction and it does not seem he is well versed in his mother's work.The book is rampant with inconsistencies, logic errors, and science flaws and in several points appears to contradict what his mother wrote back in the 70's and 80's. It is rough to read, switching scenes seemingly at random, with some of those scenes appearing to be completely pointless. There are plot elements that are abandon, never to be brought back up again. The use of ""Timing"" to solve dilemmas borders on `Deus Ex Machina' and is repetitious of earlier books in the series.I would recommend that the older fans of Pern, the fans who grew up reading the series, avoid this book."
1,"Alas, no likeable characters!","I am so fond of a great many characters in the Pern books, but somehow, by page 120 in this book, I still had not warmed to anyone. No one seemed real. No one came alive. I just gave up on the book.It's such a contrast to Dragonseye, which I first read about the same time. THAT was one of the best of the Pern books. It may be that Todd cares more about plot and details of Pern and less about characters. I'll definitely flip through any further book by him before buying it."
3,Good enuf book but lousy writing (or editing...you pick),"Question: Why would anyone spend several chapters developing a character, even have a protagonist/antagonist and sympathetic hero sub plot revolve around the main character, and then have them drop from sight for the rest of the book? Answer: Lousy writing. I love the Pern books, and this one is almost good. I understood the plot line, had sympathy for the main characters and it was a new and different plotline about the dragons getting sick. Anne in her intro praises her son's abilities to carry on the Pern saga. I disagree. I will give Todd one thing though. In the nepotistic world of science fiction series, he didn't butcher Pern as badly as Brian Herbert butchered Dune."
4,Returning to Pern is a joy,"I very much enjoyed returning to Pern with this new book by ""the son"".The story is complex, a lot of jumping thru time (not just for the dragons) for the reader, and some knowledge of Pern is needed to understand and fully appreciate this story. I found it a gripping read. Only at the end i got inpatient to know if every one in the story was well.I know some of the reviewers have fallen over inconsistencies in the story, but hey..it is fiction...and it is a good read definately!"
4,The series is in good hands!,"Though I was at first apprehensive about another author taking over my favorite series, but having read this, I can simply say... Keep them coming Todd!"
4,Dragonsblood,"I read this book in about 2 days. I had a hard time putting it down. After I read it, I started all over again I enjoyed it so much. I just didn't want it to end. The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the ending. You race to the climax and then it is like coming up against a wall. It just ends. There is nothing to rap up the story there isn't time to take a breath and know that you are finished. Other than that Todd does his Mom proud. I look forward to his next Pern book. I truly enjoyed this book."
1,Living off his mother,"This was the most disappointing piece of fiction and really belittles what Anne McCaffrey created with her original series of books. After the Dragonrider and Harper series the only good book Ms. McCaffrey produced was Moreta. I've periodically read her other books and felt let down. Now I feel completely duped by her son trying to make a dollar off of her creation.Plot? What sort of plot development was that? Lazy, is what I call it.Characterizations? Hardly!Never again will I purchase one of the allegedly approved by Anne McCaffrey books."
1,depressing!!!,"I LOVE the Pern series, but this book was a big disappointment!Written by the son,and extremely depressing. Having taken several psychology classes I could suggest a reason why, but will leave that to you.Death,death, and more death, plus a major flaw of never getting back to what happened to the ship's captain and crewmembers (won't spoil the story by saying more) Dragon-lovers beware!!!"
4,A good AM & TM book,This is one of the good books of the series that helps to fill in the time between landing and Dragons Quest. It gives some interesting insight to the dragons abilities that are confirmed in some of the other books. It is also a sad story but one that gives the people of the story hope for the future.
1,what is it with Todd and plagues?!,"He creates great characters, but has this obsession with killing them off. and now, with his dragon plague, he kills off the whole reason for the books-the dragons. not only that, he kills off a beautiful, sweet queen dragonet!i read the book, then hid it, where i will never see it again. i dont need the additional depression of his killing of characters i come to love. his books are not worth buying, especially if you are depressed, and reading to get away from the pain of that."
2,Struggle reading a Pern novel?!,"This is the first Pern book that I have had to force myself to keep reading. All the glaring inconsistencies were irritating. Like another poster wrote ""Todd, did you ever READ your mom's books"". The only thing i liked about this book was the story line during the first pass. Maybe if he had just stuck with that, instead of having a superwoman weyrywoman, with a super precocious dragong (gag me with a spoon), I could have enjoyed reading this book."
2,Too complicated,"The plot was very good, but the flow was too complex. There were too many characters referenced too quickly. Not enough background given on some of the characters. I would have liked a follow-up of a couple of minor scenes. (eg. What happened to the bad guys on the boat?)"
4,Excellent but not perfect,"Gilad is a marvelous motivator, and these are excellent excercises, fun and efffective. If you liked him on TV, as I do, you'll like him to EXACTLY the same degree here -- because these are three of those 22-minute TV shows, with just the commercials cut out: they did no additional editing to take out minor errors such as when he loses count. Also, he'll say ""keep working during the break"" and then the DVD immediately fades to the last segment - each of the three sessions is 22 minutes, not 30. In spite of the annoyance of paying for stuff I had already taped off-air, I still use his DVDs more than anyone else's, because the content is so good."
5,"Gilad: Total Body Sculpt Workout, Vol. 3","I just love Gilad and his workouts! I would catch the workouts on FitTV and get to movin'. I was so disappointed when FitTV changed their programming. Purchased other workout videos and had to stop the video to rewind. By the time I mastered one move they were two moves ahead of me. Those dvds now sit on my tv stand gathering dust. Gilad makes transition from one exercise to another very smooth. Try these workouts, 3 featured on this dvd, you will not be disappointed."
1,liberty hall sessions/live at the texas opry house,The sound quality is so low you can't enjoy any of this.I'm very disapointed.
3,Decent Start to a Complicated Phenomenon,"Although stigmata is a fascinating subject, this book is a tad disorganized. While it does break up past & present occurrences of stigmata into different chapters, within a single chapter, it smears one case into the next, sans clear transitions. Additionally, there is no appendix in the back to quickly & easily retrace specified cases.However, regardless of some of the book's drawbacks, the subject is extremely interesting & Mr. Harrison tries to take a neutral stance on it--he's neither overly enthusiastic nor distastefully cynical. He examines the possible psychosomatic, medical or spiritual causes of the wounds & the effects that they have on the afflicted individuals & the communities at large. He also delves into the history of the when, where & why stigmata seemingly started.All in all, if you're new to the study of stigmata, this book is a great start, but it may be too broad for someone already well versed in the subject."
4,All things are possible,"All things are possible. Many debate, is sigmata, the act of expression of a god, or the subliminal acts of the minds of a few. It matters not. The point is well made, all things are possible."
4,I've come home to my Mothers.,"A nice collection of songs by members of the original Mothers of Invention. Fans of Zappa's first band will certainly enjoy this collection. There are some previously unrelease tracks here, particularly from Jimmy Carl Black's band Geranimo Black. Bunk Gardner contributes so fine tracks as well. My only disappointed with this disc is the omission of the Don Preston tracks which appeared on the Grandmothers first two vinyl LP's. Too bad, as they were very strong tracks. If you can find the Rhino vinyl LP's, buy them. But this is a good outing by everybody's favorite Mothers."
4,Ogden Nash: the man behind the brain tickling humorous verse,"As I am in the middle of reading two other books, I've only scanned and read a bit of this book but what I've read has been delightful and interesting. Nash was a marvelously interesting man with an equally interesting life. As a child, I so enjoyed reading verse and limericks. From about age 7 or 8, I knew when I saw his name as author, I was in for some laughter and brain tickling reading. Doug Parker's book is a delightful expose of the life & times of the man behind those clever verses. I'm looking forward to reading the entire book."
3,good prooduct,This product was purchased for a little baby that has a cleft palate. This is the only thing he will drink and only in the strawberry flavor. Thanks for the low price and it was sent directly to my house with free shipping.
3,"My kids love them, price is not consistent...","Great drinks for kids. No argument. But Amazon's stocking and pricing of them are horrible! I was able to get them at a fair price... but within a week they went to double that! AWFUL. For an expensive product I really love the idea of being able to do S&S and get them shipped right to my doorstep for at least only as much as the grocery charges, but preferrable less. Who would pay MORE?!"
5,Pedisure,Love this product don't know what we would have done for my picky eater. She will ask for this instead of food great product.
4,OK product,"My son likes it very much, but due to the sugar and the plastic bottles, I can only give it 4 stars only. Indeed my son did gain a little weight."
1,Sticky. Sucks.,"There's not a lot more to say: It's sticky. It doesn't even taste that good, if that's what you're after. It has that artificial-sweetener-esque flavor and aroma, mixed with that artificial bubblegummy taste. Gross."
1,Boring and tedious,"As a psychologist, I was frustrated with this author and her unrealistic portrayal of the work of a psychotherapist. This was my first and last read of this disappointing series."
1,Cat's flaw,"This book is seriously flawed in several ways. It aims to be cute, with a lot of stuff about cats. It's a much faster read if you skip over the cat stuff and Cassidy's interior monologue, which rarely adds anything to the storyline. The interior monologue is printed in italics, which makes it a lot easier to skip. The primary flaw is that Cassidy McCabe decides to investigate a murder, even though a man found sleeping on the victim's sofa with the murder weapon beside him has confessed to the killing. (And he's already done time for killing somebody else in a fit of anger.) But Cassidy is convinced ""he couldn't have done it."" At the end she has to get herself in the obligatory dangerous situation. In short, nothing in the book works very well."
5,Astounding song,"This is the most accessible song on the entire album. ""When Your Falling"" is a colorful, upbeat song with breathtaking African chant vocals fusing the guest appearance of Peter Gabriel. I'm not a huge fan of duets but ""When Your Falling"" is one of the best duets I've ever heard. Most music in recent years has sounded boring to me, but this song is, I would go far enough to say, better than alot of music from the 1980s. It's kind of suprising that Peter Gabriel's appearance on this song is upbeat and somewhat happy whereas his newest masterpiece ""UP"" is very dark, tearjerking and twilight in mood. A great song."
4,Upbeat and happy,"First heard this song when I went to see the IMAX film 'Adrenaline Rush' when I was in the States. In my opinion it's a lively upbeat song, well-worth buying!"
1,Don't Buy This!,"That one star was only because there isn't a zero star catagory. I am an Afro Celt Soundsystem fan from way back and was TOTALLY disappointed by this CD. It is the same song 3 times in a row and it sounds like crap... all 3 times. You can get this same song on Realworld (It isn't even that good a number). Both Peter Gabriel and Afro Celt should be ashamed for putting out a piece of drek like this.My fault for not researching it more, it was a late night internet purchase and I must have been tired. Hopefully this will save you $11. If you must buy it then buy it used on here, I guareentee they were only played once."
3,"O.K., nothing special","This album is just fine to have in the CD player as background music while you do household chores or study or whatever, but it doesn't capture the listener's attention. Ms. Wells' voice is fine. The songs are mostly unremarkable though, with the exceptions of ""Harm's Way"", a song about military service that does a good job of being heartfelt and not jingoistic, and ""Shoes"" which is catchy. The album's not bad; it just doesn't leave you wanting more."
4,Max Shulman's Large Economy Size,"Book in very good condition with dust-jacket. The dust-jacket has a couple of small tears, see picture. No writing anywhere in book."
5,It's Finally Here!,"This is the best children's book I've read. A very spiritual and powerfully religious retelling (the only retelling) of the Creation story that is age appropriate for small children (ages 2+). It truly conveys the emmense love of God for His creation, this and ""so much more, so much more."" A book to be read by and for children of all ages from 2 - 100. A wonderful gift!"
4,"I enjoyed this novel, especially the author's point of view","The main character has a lot of veracity, and his thinking develops as he learns from his experiences. I felt I would have reacted similarly in the same situations, and could envision the varied environments in which the character finds himself. The end happens a bit quickly, and if the author hadn't needed to resolve the question of ""what happens next?"" he probably would have been better off devoting a whole book to the final sequences. As it is, he has set himself up for a sequel, and I'd really like to see this world continue. Now I'm interested in reading his other work."
1,"Started boring, quickly ran to terrible","Too many character motivational problems to hit them all... What was the point of the alien church and city? Why did his nurse wait for him? What were the glowing blue stones? How did he evolve from waif to thug to lost scion of leading family? Why did Blackburn die? What motivated him to decide to resurrect the aliens? Finally, If he had the ultimate book of the universe in his possession for 3+ (can't tell actual chronology) years, while building and planning, why wouldn't he think to actually READ IT????"
2,Not as good as his others....,"His fisrt three novels were wonderful, gritty, dark noir sci-fi. This one howerver...."
3,not what its cracked up to be!,does not JUMP on its own they should call it bending front leg horse when you push on its hind legs tawny.... Glad I got this on clearance and did not pay $25 for it I would have very disappointed...
4,Great addition to horse collection,"My 6 year old pony-collecting daughter loves this horse and ""jumps"" her around the house with and without the barbie rider. The jump, stand and other accessories are cheap but the pony seems very durable. I read a negative review because it didn't jump on its own like the similar Tawny walking pony - but come on now, what do you expect? I love that it doesn't require on/off switch or frequent battery replacement, yet it is complex enough to teach a realistic jumping technique. Especially great if your horse-fan prefers hands-on play. Price varies a lot - Amazon had the best!"
2,Not that impressed.,"After seeing the walking horse, I could not wait to see this one jump, I thought, on it's own which is not the case. When you pull the back legs the front legs pull back and the horse makes a noise. I thought it was a little deceiving, and was disappointed. The one positive remark is that the horse and Barbie are pretty."
4,Barbie and Horse well received at Christmas!,"Bought this as a Christmas gift, it was over the top! All the kids loved this. They especially loved the bendable legs on Tawney (the horse) none of my nieces had that on their other toys."
1,It was Mum's the Word for me!,"I have read most of Dorothy Cannell's books, and have loved most of them, but I have to say, this one could have been written in Greek. I didn't understand it at all. I kept reading hoping it would spring to life for me. But, I have to admit I finally put it down and gave up. I read A LOT of books and put down very few, but this one I just could not follow. Sorry Dorothy."
2,Disappointing!,"After The Thin Woman, I had expected more from this novel. Rather than the crisp prose that I anticipated, the writing in this one meanders from scene to scene without much advancing the plot. It was just difficult to maintain interest in a work that I found more tedious than engrossing. I didn't find much to recommend it."
1,Best left on the shelf!,"It's disappointing to report that the final disc in the 20CD ""PASSION"" set on Delta is probably the poorest performance of Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" I've ever heard on record! The unnamed soloists (and after hearing them I know why they wish to remain anonymous!) are, to be kind, inadequate. The orchestra and chorus do a capable job, so I can't fully fault them even if this isn't the most exciting account of this work. The ""live"" recording is also reasonable enough. Even at this superbudget price this is hardly a bargain. Best left alone, any other recording out there of ""Carmina Burana"" is probably a better buy than this!"
5,An exceptional guide to an amazing series,"I've adored this series since grade school and I reread it periodically, but until the last few times I never understood the allegory in the book. I bought the companion just because I collect books that go along and I just finished reading it. I was not disappointed....it answered so many questions that I had about characters and themes and the maps/timeline were excellent in helping to understand the geography and time of Narnia vs Earth. I plan on using it as a reference the next time I read the series despite having already read it straight through. This is a must have for any Narnia enthusiast."
2,Chicago Cutlery,"The knives looked good and are dishwashable. However, they are very dull and I am unable to sharpen them."
4,Pickover's puzzling nature strikes again,"Clifford Pickover truly seems to be a Renissance man. His previous forays into conundrums and puzzles have ranged from time travel to hyperspace to infinity.This time, its cryptography. While some of the aspects of these puzzles might be hard for some novices, and I could wish for room and space to more easily work on the puzzles, the puzzles themselves are a joy to play with.If you like cryptographic analysis, enjoyed Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, or want to try a brain teaser of a different sort, then you might want to delve into Cryptorunes."
2,Didn't like this book,"We've read several other books that are modeled after ""'Twas The Night Before Christmas"" and have enjoyed them. The rhyming of this book is enjoyable, but there are several things that I did not like. 1) There is a reference to ""day care"", stating that ""Some kids brought blankets or their favorite stuffed bear, in hopes they could nap like they did in day care."" My daughter asked what day care was. 2) Too much was made about parents crying, and it is not appropriate. If parents are crying, a 5-year-old does not need to be burdened with this. In the book, the parents stayed at school, crying and watching, while the kids did about a dozen activities! That is totally not realistic. In fact, the crying parents (and the children setting THEM at ease with a final goodbye and hug and wave) seemed to occupy the bulk of the book, instead of focusing on how the child is getting bigger, and going to like school, etc., etc."
2,Portrays Kindergarten as a scary place,"I do not recommend because it essentially presupposes that kindergarten is a scary place and that you only need to overcome your fears when entering this frightening place. That's how it seemed to me, at least.Instead of describing kindergarten as a fun, happy, loving place, it talks about how children are at first afraid, but then learn to like it. Why even suggest that your child should be afraid?Worse, in the book, all the parents stay in the classroom, outside the door watching. That's not how school works. The parents are not there, so why suggest that they are going to be at the door looking in during the day?Not recommended. The other ""night before"" books I like, just not this one."
3,Shipping,"I received this book along with ""countdown to Kindergarten"" the shipping was 1 day faster than scheduled. So a big thumbs up! Just got done reading it to my daughter, she liked it more than the countdown book. But after I opened the package and scanned the book I found that it was damaged. The top right corner was rippled. Even though it is small it still hurts my feelings. I would have sent it back but figured I could deal with it. Other than that I think the book us cute. Recommend!"
2,Unrealistic,"I bought several copies of this book for neighborhood children who are starting school in September. After reading it, I am not going to give it to anyone. In the book, parents drive their children to school. There is no mention of a ""bus ride"" which is how everyone gets to school (where we live, anyway!). The idea that Mommy and Daddy will be dropping them off at school is misleading and confusing. I also agree with one person's comments about the parents crying. Do kids need to worry about this? The purpose of buying this book was to ease children's fears, not add to worry and confuse them. A waste of money!"
5,It will help you maintain the positive attitude it develops,"This tape is a bit corny in spots, but even after considering those corny spots and taking out what is good, even those spots are helpful. I feel they could have done a little better job, but I am rating it with 5 stars because it does work well. I have listened to it about 10 - 15 times so far and it has gone a long way to help me be more positive and confident. I have purchased a second copy (the price is great, no need to pirate it) in case the first one gets worn out. I only listen to it on my way to work in my car, and it sure starts my day out right. And it's a lot better than listening to all the negative crap you get on the radio. I highly recommend you purchase this bargain!"
3,Skip While-U-Drive... here's why:,"If you read my other reviews, you can see I'm a fan of Bob Griswold's CD's. BUT -- having tried 2 of the ""While-U-Drive"" series... I can only give these 3 stars. Why?The music. It's terrible. It's elevator music. At best, it's smooth jazz, at worst, it's the ""demo"" key on a Casio keyboard. His other recordings had classical or new age music, or nature sounds in the background.I should probably also mention that the format is a little different. It's Bob and his wife Deirdre, and there are talking segments mixed in-between affirmations. Nothing bad about that, but if you know his other recordings, this isn't the same thing.While-U-Drive series: the content is good, but the music is so bad that I won't be listening again. Check out his ""Love Tapes"" or ""Super Strength"" series instead."
1,Save Your Money,"I'm smart enough, I'm good enough, and people like me. It was painful to listen to this corny and very dated cd. These people are not gurus. I thought this nonsense went out of style in the seventies. I'm sorry, repeating to yourself ""I feel positive. I am positive."" doesn't do a darn thing. That is a conceptual statement and does not register in the right brain. Visual pictures and images do register. This is a waste of time and money. Besides that, the cd skipped and stuttered on both my players.Obviously these reviewers never attended any form of human potential course or they would have already been familiar with this material. I went through this stuff thirty years ago. It didn't work then either. Save your money and buy a bottle of wine, instead. It will make you more positive and you won't feel ripped off."
5,"GET THIS CD! (just not here...$106.00, REALLY?!)","Thankfully, I did not buy this on Amazon! (I love Amazon, but the used price on this item is ridiculous! I am an avid (my wife might say crazed) music collector. I can spend hours in used CD stores, perusing the shelves and that is how I found this gem. I was not familiar with the CD, but anytime I see something on One-Way records, I buy it! (It didn't hurt that it was priced at only $3.99) This CD displays 2 masters, comfortably playing off of one another, as if with one mind. This CD is simply beautiful!"
5,WONDERFULLY CAPTIVATING!,"This was the first book I read by Ann Rinaldi, but certainly not the last! This enthralling book had me flipping the pages as fast as I could and I couldn't even put it down. I ended up staying up really late so that I could finish it! It breathes words and emotions into history, weaving personality into text-book knowleadge. A concentrated thematical overview: Hannah, the main character, feels as if her life has been torn apart. As she tries to piece it together, she decides to start a quilt in which anyone with whom a trust was formed between them and the Chelmsford family will contribute a square of fabric to represent that person. The metaphorical meaning behind the quilt is most fascinating and cleary intriguing from the first page! Any fan of American history will thouroughly enjoy this novel of true love, family, and, of course, trust to the highest extent possible!"
5,A Salem girl goes through hard times with her family.,"I think this book is one of Ann Rinaldi's best works. Her descriptions are excellent. This was the first book I read of hers, and I still think that it is the best."
5,the PERFECT novel,"I LOVED this book as it says in the title its the perfect book. I first found it when my school librarian reccommended it for a trip i was taking at first i was skeptical i mean come on ""The Quilt Trilogies"" where do u get a name like that? when i picked it up BOY did i feel stupid! I couldnt put it down and was really really upset when i finished it (i wanted more about Hannah and Richard!:( ) i had to wait 2 days to go to the library to get broken days i was disappointed with it it wasnt nearly as good as A stitch in time to me at least id reccommend A Stitch in Time to any one who can read not just historical fiction readers btw from how she describes him - if he didnt have long hair Richard sounds kinda hott!!!"
3,folk rock CD,Not quite as good as the reviews I read that influenced me to buy it. Five more words needed now.
4,Good songs from a great songwriter,"It is good to hear Steve Goodman songs that were made famous by others. Though Arlo Guthrie and David Alan Coe did better-known versions of ""City of New Orleans"" and ""You Never Even Called Me by my Name,"" there is a sweetness and originality to Goodman's performances that is touching. Listening to these songs is a poignant reminder of what might have been if this talented performer had not died young."
3,it's like a well made catalogue,"Not bad informations in it because it covers so wide range of architectural materials, but its depth of knowledge is rather shallow.It might be good for a reference when you need something new but there's no special derection on it."

3,I was left wanting with with one.,"Stephanie Laurens' writing is easy and enjoyable. The story could have been better. I was disappointed. I just did not get that ""happy feeling"" in the end. Not a winner for me."
4,Also available in...,"Although not in large print, be aware this novel was included in Rogues' Reform by Harlequin in 2000. Rogues' Reform contains three Stephanie Laurens stories (including An Unwilling Conquest) set during the English Regency. The stories feature the romances of the three Lester siblings, a sister and two brothers. The set is excellent and I would highly recommend them. They are much tamer, however, than Laurens more recent novels dealing with the Cynster family. Note: the hero in A Comfortable Wife, Lord Phillip Ruthven is introduced in Rogues' Reform."
5,Excellent product at amazing price!,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving these planters. They are very well made, attractive, and come with a strong plastic liner pot. Having shopped extensively for hanging planters I am just amazed to find something like this at this price. Don't pass it up, I can't imagine they will be around at this price forever."
5,Best kit on the market!,This is absolutely by far the best product on the market! I have an older bike and was having problems of old lining and rust going through my fuel line and getting stuck in the carb. Thus resulting in my float sticking and draining all of my fuel on the ground. I purchased the POR-15 HD kit and followed the instructions exactly.I was very impressed with the first step the removal of the old liner. WOW!!!This is going to be the ONLY kit I ever buy to line any of my tanks and I have quite a few bikes.
1,DId not work for my Mac Pro,This mouse did not work well with my Mac Pro. Scroll wheel would stop for no reason. Mouse would not always track with the mouses movements. Replaced it within weeks
3,Sons and Lovers is a great view of an unguided soul's life.,"Paul Morel, the main character of the book, Sons and Lovers, is an unguided soul that searches for some guidance in life. Clarity is what he seems to achieve through his topsy-turvy relationships with family, friends, and love interests. Paul's family, although traditional, has its issues. Gertrude, Paul's mother, tries to live her life through her sons' lives. His brothers have their individual problems as well. I enjoyed the book due to its simplicity in plot but its tough reading style. The british text really sets it in its time. On the other hand, I found the book boring at times. Overall, it gets a 3."
2,I Guess I Just Don't Like DH Lawrence,"This is the second Lawrence novel I have read, the first being Lady Chatterly's Lover. I didn't really like it to much but I recognized the man had talent. He has some of the most elegant prose I have ever read. I heard this is a superior novel and much more profound so I decided to give it a whirl.Basically I couldn't stand it. I admit his writing is great, but I just can't get into this. Maybe it's the subject matter which is kind of strange, or maybe it's just personal taste, I don't know for sure. I am a great fan of literature of all kinds, but the period of writing from 1910-1925 I don't seem to enjoy. Sure Joyce wrote some ingenious things, Hemmingway was a great romantic writer but the stuff just doesn't click with me. Oh well, I gave the book 2 stars because I enjoyed the prose, but that is all I enjoyed."
2,"Can we all say: ""Okay, Paul, get over your mother""?","D.H. Lawerence kinda scares you with this book. It's beginning chapters, while it introduces you to characters, are boring. Let's face it: Classic British Literature is boring, and Lawerence only adds to it worse. His character, Paul Morel, obviously loves his mother a BIT TOO much. I'm not saying you have to consider this bad, I'm just saying that it made the book pointless. A man, living his life with constant remorse because no other woman can satisfy due to his mother?? How sad and how pathetic. The guy lost his virginity to a girl, then LEAVES her. The book is no where near what I call entertaining or exciting or even worth reading. However, it does have one quality: If you need to go to sleep, pick up this book."
3,Not All That,"Sons and Lovers, while a good book, is not, in my opinion, great. The ending left me unsatisfied. I don't know whether the reader is supposed to sympathize with Paul Morel, but I didn't. I found him to be - what did I find him to be? - he is arrogant and - what were his qualities? - I don't know, just arrogant. In fact, I did not find any characters that I liked. Although you don't have to like the characters to like the book, I didn't even like the plot. It was bland. You're probably wondering why I gave it three stars. There were some parts of the book that were excellent at showing human nature and how people relate to each other. For instance, Paul was attracted to Clara because at first she was indifferent to him. It just shows you that The Rules were at work even nearly a century ago! In conclusion, I like the book, I just don't loooove the book. I also did not quite feel the relationship between Paul and his mother."
3,Separation Anxiety,"This book made it to Time's Top 100 List of the best fiction of the 20th century. While the prose has merit, I don't quite see why it placed so high on the list nor is this edition the best. There is no table of contents and the chapter distinctions are poor; so too is the editing as there are many typos. Despite all that, Lawrence's primitively modernist novel is well-constructed and very innovative for its time. All in all, this book is worth the read."
4,"A very, very good novel","I read this a long time ago and hated it with a passion. I was chuckling reading the one-star reviews here, because had the Internet been around when I first read this book, I would have given it a scathing, one-star review.The first time around, I was bored to tears, and it took me forever to finish. This time, I was so moved by certain sections my tears were falling on the page, and it took me only a week (or maybe it was six days) to finish. And though I will never call this my favorite classic, I liked it so much that currently I am reading Lawrence's ""The Rainbow.""Make sure you get an edition that helps explain the dialect. After a while, I was able to figure it out myself, and that was kind of fun -- almost like learning a new language."
4,Sons and Lovers,Sons and Lovers was good read - format was not great but ok - love the charecter descriptions - very well written
4,Sons and Lovers,Great story line but almost too descriptive when it comes to countryside. Skipped over that a lot. Had difficult time with the father's language. Felt sorry for Paul's mother's hold over him. Predicted the outcome.
4,His best.,"This novel wins the unique distinction of being the smelliest novel i have ever read. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that throughout the story the reader's nose is besieged with myriad scents of flowers, flowers that are counterbalanced by the pungent scents of grimy coal miners. This is one of the beauties of this novel.However I am not a Lawrence fan and think this by far his best work. The reason it is his best is because he keeps his utterly irrelavant philosopies out of the story; he doesn't wine and lament about the ""plight"" of ""modern man"". He does however do this in the following novel, the Rainbow, which is a complete disaster. Don't trust anyone who compares Lawrence to Henry Miller; unlike Miller Lawrence actually is capable of writing well."
4,A great study of human emotions,"This is a perfect book for anyone who enjoys reading twentieth century British literature. I like the fact that D. H. Lawrence is able to realistically portray the emotions of the many characters in the book. I did not only learn Paul's side of the story, but I also gained insight into Gertrude's, Miriam's, and Clara's thoughts and feelings towards Paul and towards each other. This omniscient narration makes the story a more interesting study into human emotions. Lawrence deals very heavily with psychological motivations for each character's actions, making the characters more human and believable. This is a great story that goes far beneath the surface. Sons and Lovers is a thought-provoking tale of love, death, possession, vulnerability, and heartache. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book to read."
3,A Good Study,"This is not the drum I march to. But it was one of my teacher Ms Worby's favorites. And I can see why. Lawrence does present us with graphic images, dramatic confrontations, an oedipal complex, and a love triangle. The disputes between Clara and Miriam are especially memorable. Clara's vain attitude contrasts sharply with Miriam's genuine love for the protagonist Paul. In all honesty this book is never boring. The reason I could not get overly attached to this is I feel Lawrence lacks the charm that Dickens always throws into his novels. I have respect for this book, and I understand its significance in the world of literature. But I don't feel D.H. Lawrence is another Charles Dickens."
3,"Sons & Lovers, a child of its time","Sons & Lovers is by far one of the most insightful books I have read, following the story of a working-class family in early 19th century Nottinghamshire. It focuses on the second son of the aptly named Morel family, and his life and relationships within it. It is largely written from a psychological point of view, but it's lengthy description can drag on. An excellent book following the relationship between mother and son, the over-shadowing power of maternal influence, and although the chapters are hard work, the effect is strong and this book is definately a good read.It may be stuck in its time of writing, but a brilliant reflection of pre-World War One lower class life. An excellent read."
4,Not as Smutty as I Expected,"The man is an absolute master at relationships. I have not read any other writer that has his patience and skill at building complex, realistic relationships through the accumulation of minute detail. While the characters and plot are only adequate, the relationships between the characters, and the poetic prose, drove the novel and managed to keep me engaged the whole way through. I was surprised that this novel, at least, showed no indication of the smuttiness of which Lawrence has often been accused. Overall, a good introduction to a literary author who will get another look later."
2,unsatifying,"I read this book for my English class and I found it to be ultimately unsatifying. I think Lawrence's prose is incredible but I just could not empathize with Paul Morel - he''s so childish and weak. Paul is only charming during his love scenes with Clara when he affects the Welsh accent of Walter Morel. I thought Gertrude Morel was a despicable woman who treated her husband with undeserved contempt and emotionally suffocated her sons. In the book, Gertrude's death leaves Paul in a world of darkness, he's a broken man. However, it's interesting to note that as much as D.H.Lawrence (the book is semi-autobiographical) came to view his mother as a negative influence in his mature years. As an adult, it is D.H. Lawrence's father who is personified as Walter Morel, for whom he exhibited admiration."
3,A long yet unusual story,"This book follows the life of the Morel family, and takes a close look at the close mother-son relationship. D. H. Lawrence, although too detailed in his writing at times, is very perceptive when it comes to human relationships and his characters are very believable. The story is rather serious though, there is little humour.However it takes unexpected twists and turns, which makes this very long novel worth finishing."
5,Huge Harold,"Bill Peet is a fabulous writer. His rhyming technique makes his books easy to read. Huge Harold is my favorite book of Bill Peets by far.... You'll fall in love with Huge Harold. I did. In most of his books you start out feeling sorry for main character, but they all end up on top in the end. It really give you a good feeling inside. There are good morals to his stories, and I enjoy reading every one of them over and over again."
5,Best children's book ever!,"This has been my favourite children's book since I was a boy. Wonderfully illustrated, and it carries a beauty filled message: that we all have unique talents and there is a place for each of us. Once we have achieved great success, stay humble!"
1,Mixed up Facts,"This is a self-indulgent, boring, book about someone who decided to throw their life away. It is not interesting reading about someone who had promise and then decided to ""see the world"" by doing drugs and working at menial jobs and not caring about the people that he is hurting. It is obvious to this reader that this writer was obviously writing this book through his drug addled brain.Also, before someone writes an autobiographical book they should make sure that they get their facts straight when writing about others and using their full names. They should also let those people know that they are being written about. I'm sure that many of the people noted in this book will be very surprised to find out that they are even mentioned."
1,Over-rated,"You are better off reading the original papers. Most of the stuff are not new, and has been done better by other authors."
2,"OK, but nothing to shout about","It's not a bad book, but half the time I am not sure what the author is driving at..."
3,MISSES THE TARGET SOMEWHAT,"TRIGGERMEN is an odd mix of comedy and crime drama, well acted but sometimes sluggish and derivative. Adrian Dunbar and Neil Morrissey play two limey petty thieves who steal money meant for two hitmen, and then are forced to assume the hitmen's identities and pull off the hit against a rival crime boss. The movie IS entertaining, it's just not overly original. Along with the fine performances from Dunbar and Morrissey, we get Donnie Wahlberg and Michael Rapaport as the real hitmen; gorgeous Claire Forlani as the daughter of the intended target, well played by Pete Postelthwaite, and Amanda Plummer as the somewhat witchy girlfriend of Dunbar. Overall, a pleasant diversion."
2,starts slow but ends well,"This is an odd comedy and if you can get through the slow (see boring) scenes, it's worth watching.The plot is rather simple, but you'll see twists and turns that keep you somewhat amused. There are a few romantic moments between two of the leading characters.Overall, it's a decent movie for a rainy day. You'll laugh more than a few times."
2,Triggermen is a waste of talent,"This film was a waste of talent.Aside that it wraped up neatly like the dead body in the rug at the end,this film was a regurgitation of others&lacked originality.It was slow&borring,and I could'nt wait until the end.I was figiting like a little kid...practically begging for the credits to roll.See it for yourself,but this movie is'nt worth purchasing."
4,An intro to Dennett's thought on consciousness,"Anybody who wants to seriously wrestle with Dennett's thought on consciousness needs to start here, then move to ""Consciousness Explained,"" and from there to ""Freedom Evolves."" (It is an update of ""Elbow Room,"" which means that can be skipped. And, although it has some germs of Dennett's thought, ""Brainstorms"" can also be bypassed.)Does one have to have a philosophy course touching on intentionality before reading this book? No, not if one is well-enough read in philosophy, psychology or sociology in general to grasp the background of Dennett's ideas.I rate this a star higher than most of Dennett's later work primarily because it is more introductory, and so we see less of Dennett tripping himself up or avoiding some of the logical conclusions of his speculations.That said, Dennett is never dull or boring; agree or disagree, he will stimulate your thought."
4,"The more you listen to it, the more you like it...","I got this disc used at a bookstore in Washington DC a couple of years ago. What grabbed me was the cover photo - I had never heard of the band, but they looked like they were a no-nonsense gritty garage band. I had no idea what to expect.I was initially surprised at variety of music they played, from rock to blues to rockabilly to Elvis-esque to mellow acoustic. (The disc also has bonus tracks, cover tunes, and live stuff). After listening to it the first time, I thought it was merely OK. After listening to it again, I started to hear the raw straight-to-the-amp guitar, the extended jams, and it's grown on me ever since. Liner notes make reference to Mick Jagger allegedly saying this album is better than the Stones' ""Sticky Fingers"" - I wouldn't go quite that far - but it's pretty darn close. (The piano player from the ""Fingers"" sessions even plays on 3 of the tracks.)It was a lucky find for me - I recommend it."
4,Great pre-Punk r'n'r CD,"This is mostly in response to the 2 earlier posts about this LP, (OK, date me). This will definitely appeal to the MC5/Stooges crowd, and indeed anyone who interested in where punk came from. Is it exactly like that - of course not, but it has the spirit and it is real RNR. Also check out the NY Dolls, Dictators, Carl Perkins, Pretty Things. It's timeless - just avoid the fluff and get the good stuff.Flamin' Groovies 'teenage head' and 'flamingo'GOOD STUFFRock on baby"
4,No dues,"Great record, unfortunately BMG hasn't paid a dime in mechanicals/royalties to Jordan or Loney since releasing this in 1999. Yet another screw-over by a ripoff record company."
2,In the Groovies,"I like the name of this San Francisco band Flamin Groovies and their history is quite interesting but this CD provides very little interesting tracks. The bonus cover tunes are fair at best. I heard one of their tunes on sat. radio and decided to take a chance on FG. Well, you wins some and you lose some. Not that great."
3,Good if you love the topic,"Homosexuality in pre-colonial Native American societies disproves this idea that the only ""gay-affirming"" culture that ever existed was Greek (and white). A huge audience for and books about gay Native Americans have been born. Whereas Sue-Ellen Jacobs' book is more anthropological, this book is more social work-oriented. It talks about the issues that social workers will face in serving some gay and lesbian Native Americans. Again, this is another white-edited and -authored book on the topic, and I can't wait until a Native gay person takes the wheel on such a project. Also, this volume is slim and easy to read within a day or two. If you love the topic, you should add this to your collection. Otherwise, you may want to select the other books out there first."
4,More comfortable than they look,Sexy looking shoes that are actually comfortable to wear. And I'm someone who never wears anything with a heel over 1 1/2 inches high.
5,Original Dr. Scholl's,"Comfortable, stylish and priced right! I got them in red and brown and am always looking for an excuse to wear them,. . . even around the house. Would purchase them again and again and again, in every color available in my shoe size. Great buy!!"
3,Essential for the Married Man with Kids,"For years I have struggled with trying to balance my family, my career, and my health. With this book I have finally learned how to get in an excellent workout in a short period of time without having to invest the time in going to the gym. The author provides some great discipline ideas to get into shape and STAY IN SHAPE. I would recommend this book to anyone who has all of the loads of family and work who realizes the necessity for good health and fitness. I haven't read anything that synthesizes the mental and physical path better."
5,A touching and well-written movie,"Several years ago, your Dad died Driving Drunk. Or did he...?While on a hiking trip, the actor played by Kyle Howard discovers a bag of mail hidden in a ruined building far out in the woods. After returning the bag to the local mail office, he receives a letter ...a letter that had been lying in the bag for years before it could finally be delivered.When he reads the letter, Kyle has to gang up with a girl who hates him to find out the truth about her father's death.. the reason, when discovered, will earn the finder $2,000,000... or death.Don't judge the movie by this hastily written review: ADDRESS UNKNOWN is a great movie for all audiences. It moves you in a way few movies I've seen before does, while being realistic as well as dramatic."
5,Good family movie,I purchased this movie for my family when it first became available from Feature Films for Families and watch it periodically. The acting is really good and storyline is believable. I intend to share it with my grand kids as they grow older and highly recommend it for your family.
3,"Riveting Plot, Terrible Translation","I loved the premise of this novel, with its strong characterization of Jan; but the miserable translation is very distracting and downright careless. The Nazi party has always, and rightfully so, been vilified; however, this book describes the attraction it had for the German middle class. Very thoughtful examination, but I sure would have liked a better translation; it is halting, and does not choose the English words very well."
5,cutest little monkey,"Such a well made stuffed animal. I recently bought two for my 1 year old son. His two older brothers each have a monkey that they sleep with and just adore. I looked high and low for a monkey for the baby and finally I found this one and it's PERFECT! Great size, well made and adorable! Super soft and cuddly."
5,You Are Nuts If You Haven't Copped This,"Okay, we were all thinking it... a Christmas album?! But, like you I was put in check. In my previous review on another movement album I mentioned TRUTH. He kicks the CD off with a hot track that adds a little R&B flow. This is one of the things that I love about Cross Movement Records most recent efforts. They are hitting us with STRICTLY GOSPEL, bringing it fresh out the trenches with rhymes that make you say ""DEEEGGGGG!"", and now even flippin the script by throwing some R&B flava into the mix. It's the best of both world. I also enjoyed that this CD brought a little bit of the entire CMR label. This one is a must have. It's almost February and I am still listening."
4,Really good album!,I wish it was christmas so i can bump this album.This cd is a very solid one. The lyrics are the highlight of the album even tho the production is good. Cross Movement and co present the truth about christmas...and it aint cheezy either.This compilation is well worth checkin out...and also good christmas present.
4,a little small,"These were really nice cleats, but they run a little small (as with other addidas shoes). I had to return them and would have gotten the next 1/2 size up if it had been available. I can't say how durable they are as my son never got to use them. Overall great shoes, great price but order 1/2 size larger than you would normally need."
2,Way too much needless information,"I agree with one reviewer, in the fact that this book is just WAY too full of useless information. 80% of this book is filler. I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me. I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying. I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'. Instead, I found my patience was being tested! I don't recommend this book for anyone who doesn't want to know every little nit picking detail about certain things like the origins of language, and certain common sense things, which he explains in FULL detail.No need for this book."
1,Nothing Much,"That's what it is...It's a book that takes a few key concepts and embellished it to reasonable thickness so as to hit the stores looking good. I finished it in 1 1/2 days - skipping many mundane references. In my opinion, the book is probably worth less than 20 pages of useful material."
4,Treats the core 20% like rest of the 80%,"This is a good reference for Oracle RAC. The author makes a mistake, however, of treating the core 20% of RAC like rest of the 80%. For example, the book's details on Oracle RAC installation was about the same as its explanation of OCFS 1.0.I think 3 things about ORACLE RAC are essential and perhaps the most important part of RAC knowledge. They are the architecture, the installation (not that simple), and the administration. Approximately 20% of the book is dedicated to the 3 core topics.To his credit, the author does provide some fine examples and detailed knowledge on many esotoric aspects of RAC. For example, I have found his insights into DBMS and DGMRL packages related to RAC very helpful."
4,Excellent Book for 10g RAC,This book covers both Oracle RAC and Grid Technology with great examples. I recommend this book to all DBA's who want to implement 10g RAC. This book is big asset to people who are already using Oracle 10g RAC.
1,Do not buy!!!,"I bought this tap because it came with the proper drill bit. The bit worked fine,but the tap broke halfway through the first hole. Now I have half a tap stuck in the back of my AK."
2,Not useful in the kitchen,"I got this knife in a set and honestly I don't like it at all. It seems to saw almost tear instead of cut, I believe the serrations are fare to pointed. When it comes time to sharpen you can't really even do that, your basically just sharpening the point of the serrations. Even when freshly sharpened the blade is vary thick which makes it hard to move though the food your cutting. On top of this, one side is totally flat making a straight cut in fibrous or dense things difficult because it wants to follows the arc of the side that's curved.I could see it being vary useful if your carving up a kill in the woods, but not so much for efficient food prep."
2,Not worth it,"The knife dulls immediately. Knife couldn't cut through meat, probaly only cood as a lettuce cutter. Knife began to rust after first use."
5,Haunting,"TrystI really was being to think that I was the only one who had read and been haunted by this book. I, like many of the other reviewers, read Tryst in my teens and it has remained in my memory for over 40 years. One of the only other books to stay with me in this way is Precious Bane by Mary Webb; which was also written in the 1st half of the 20th century. Both are stories that touch your heart and come alive in your imagination."
5,Never to be forgotten love story...,"I, too, read this book while in my teens...numerous times. It has stayed in my memory for thirty years although my library destroyed its copy years ago. I can only hope that Amazon will deliver yet again and get me this much-loved old friend."
5,A must read.,"This is just quite simply one of the most romantic, satisfying, and wonderful books that I have ever read."
5,Feel good,"I read this book as a young adult and fell in love with the story. I managed to get a copy of the book but unfortunately it was stolen some seventeen years later. Since then we've emigrated to New Zealand and for the past 30 odd years have been keeping an eye out for a copy - finally, I got lucky on Amazon! It's a lovely story of young love and how, by a twist of fate, two young lives do not turn out the way they were supposed to. It is set during the beginning of WWII - some may say it's predictable however, there is an unexpected twist at the end. A great read for a cold, wet afternoon by the fire."
5,Visiting an old Friend,"I read this book when I was a preteen and have reread it off and on over the years. Recently, thought of it and decided to purchase my own copy."
2,dead battery,"Watch came with a dead battery. Very frustrating that after purchasing an inexpensive watch- on purpose, not even the battery was fully charged. Now I have to spend another $10 to replace the battery."
1,Still Not Using!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The instruction manual suck - absolutely think Timex needs to get Americans to write the instruction manualIt is still sitting in the box!!!!!!!!
1,Not worth the money,I regret this purchase since I found other books/ publication that is a lot less and covers a whole lot more rules
1,Absoultely terrible,This is a joke. The remote controller is maldesigned. The battery pack is to deep which means that the batteries do not have acurate contact. The result is that it does not work. I had to modifiy the thing myself just to get it to go half the time. Quality is also cheap. The door broke off the first day. The dolls from the same company are equally cheap (not the price but the quality). Dont buy this product you'll regret any penny you spend on it. Don't they bather to test their toys to see if it actaully works?
2,Too Expensive,"[...] I would say, don't do it. If you really feel you want this car [...]The remote control on this car sucks. You have to push both buttons up and it gets confusing when you want it to go left or right. You don't get smooth turns. You get alot of spin-outs. And it might scratch your floors.But if you just want to play with it and not drive much, then it's cool to get. [...]"
1,Total waste!,Imagine my 10 year old's disappointment on Christmas morning when the only thing she really wanted didn't work!! It took my husband 1/2 an hour to get the batteries into the car then the remote only worked when touching the antennae. She had to crawl around touching the car and then it only crept along slowly.We took it back and didn't even bother to get our batteries back because it was too much trouble. Save your money!!
2,Don't make this your first choice,"I've studied from tons of books over the years and this is my least favourite ever. The subject matter is presented in what I feel is mostly a haphazard way. The author uses games to illustrate concepts about vb.net. However, if you wanted to search the book for a particular subject for reference, it would be hard to do. It does sort of build on topics, but not like a book should. The worst problem is that the first program, a cheesy dice rolling program is packed with coding errors. The errors weren't bad, but they were numerous. I did find the coding example interesting, but it did seem more like random mixture of stuff than an organized explanation. I guess my biggest complaint is that I shouldn't have to debug the code examples in the book this much. Overall, I am unhappy with the book and I'll not buy another APress book again. It seems to me that this book suffered from bad editing and rushed production."
2,Don't be fooled,"The reason I'm giving this book a low score is because I don't think it does what it promises. First of all, it's very hard to learn ANY programming language(including Basic) through game programming. If you know VB.NET well, go ahead and give it a try. I, however, am a newbie to game programming, and after reading through the first few chapters and finding the text confusing and having to frequently read lines over and over because it doesn't explain itself in a fasion it should to it's target audience, still don't know how to program a game."
2,"And interesting read, but not really helpful","I bought this book on a few reviews and the price of the book. What it offers is sadly not able to run. I mean, I downloaded the source from the publishers' site, and that ran fine. However, I compared it to my hand-typed version (following the books' examples) and my program is a mirror image (it seems to me, anyway) of the authors' code. However, it continues to give me an error on something that already has a value, and it reports it as having a 'null' value.And this is just the first program in the first chapter of the book. I'm sorry, but if you are going to put code in a book, please make it ALL consistent with every other part, there were a few places where the compiler warned me about some names not being defined because the author got lazy and put an abbriviated name in for another variable or procedure.I will continue to read this book and try to code it, but I will be wary of other programming books that come from this publisher."
2,Yucky,"I am not experienced with pressure cookers, so you may chose to ignore my review. These recipes were complicated, and not at all easy to put together. They largely came out bland as well. Maybe I am just a bad cook."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping for a book with some detailed suggestions supported by research. To my disappointment, the book consists of short quotes that may or may not be relevant, contradictory statistics, and references that reminded me of my childhood Sunday School classes. While this book may be helpful to parents just beginning to have an interest in raising respectful, self-sufficient children, it didn't contain any new ideas for me. I was also discouraged by the way that the ideas that were presented were given with no background, no detail and no supporting evidence. This book was a big disappointment to me and I wish I hadn't spent my money on it."
2,Not enough meat,This book with a catchy title just does not deliver and it was obvious that the author does not have extensive experience dealing with children other than her own. The book was a quick read and I didn't learn anything new.
5,An amazing amount of wisdom in one book,"I've read and reviewed lots of parenting books over the years, but Raising Respectful Children makes the top of my list. It is written from a Christian perspective, but it doesn't bludgeon the reader with Bible verses. Author Jill Rigby offers seasoned, practical advice on parenting that looks to the long term: What do we want our children to be like in their inner selves? One of the key ideas in this book is how important it is to help our children develop self respect rather than self esteem. If every parent could grasp even that one message, it could change the world."
3,"My ""Romeo and Juliet"" personal opinion","We like and sometimes didn't like this book. ""Romeo and Juliet"" is based in an ""impossible "" love. We recommend you not reading this book if you don't like romantic stories.Also this book didn't like us because it was boring and very difficult to read. I understand that was Shakespeare language but for these new generations is very difficult. In the other way, we like it because the characters did everything for completing their dreams. We could see that Romeo did every thing for being with Juliet.Thank you for giving us this place for expressing our ideas."
5,Truth-lies Joy-pain Love-hate: Romeo and Juliet,"Romeo and Juliet is the nicer love story I've never read.It got everything: the love,the hate,the passion,the death.It's an example of human feelings.Amazing! ""Give me my Romeo and when he shall die cut him into little stars so all the world will be in love with night..."""
3,Far from satisfying,"This radio adaptation is interesting in some ways, but it remains rather short on its objective. The sound universe created behind the voices is rather diminutive. Some voices are not that very accurate : Juliet is rather old-sounding and Romeo is quite late in his twenties at least. Lord Capulet speaks as if he were plain drunk all the time. But what's more some interpretations are defective. The famous sonnet during the dance is just badly done. The tone is wrong. The wit is flattened, etc. The balcony scene is slightly better, luckily. Romeo, by the way, is too much of a hooligan, of an agressive character, not at all in keeping with the world we can vaguely hear behind. Finally there are some cuts and some changes in the text that are not at all justified, such as pacing for passing . Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."
2,Romeo and Juliet,"We think this is a very good book. It has a lot of elements that different people would like. It shows how the hate of some persons, can hurt others, and, in this case, kill each other.It helps people to accept the reality, and to see things how they really are.Although the book is very interesting, it may confuse younger lectors. Very young children may not understand it easily. And the vocabulary is, sometimes, very difficult to understand.There are quite a lot of details that may bore some readers, and a lot of characters, which may be confusing.So, in conclusion we recommend that just older people should read it."
3,Romeo and Juliet,"Romeo and Juliet is a great book. It's an interesting book to read. It is about tragic love during Shakespeare's time. Their love was impossible because their families, Montagues and Capulets, hated each other. The book shows how a couple fights against everything for their love. It has a tragic end in which both, Romeo and Juliet die, because nobody accepted their love.You must have a very good English, to understand it. Because it is written in old English, what, in some parts may confuse the reader.Though for some moments it may be boring, because it gives too many details, we enjoyed the story, and we recommend it.It's definitely one of the best books written by Shakespeare."
4,I sense it is good,I have just bought my first Moka Express. I haven't had chance to use replacement. I think it's good to aim one replacement. You won't know when you need it. So preparing a spare is better like your car's tire :)
3,Haven't needed them yet,"Still using the one that came with my espresso maker and it holds up fine but, just in case I didn't want to be stuck without it. Looks like these will fit well enough when the time comes though."
1,Where's my coffee?!!!,"Um, review? Ha ha. I bought this item over a month ago a d I still havnt received it. I'd really like a cup of coffee sometime this year."
1,Wrong size,"The description says this is for a 1-cup maker, but the product that was sent is clearly marked as a 6-cup gasket set."
1,Very disappointed,Got this for my mom. She wanted to replace the seals on her one cup filter. The thing DOES NOT FIT. It's too small. I see that I was not the only person who bought this product and did not get what was expected. Bah humbug!!
4,Fits IKEA Moka Pot,"I've had an IKEA Moka pot for years and the two gaskets it came with finally wore completely out. A visit to IKEA for the allegedly available replacement gaskets was futile - no stores actually carry them it seems - so I took a chance that these seals would fit my 3 cup IKEA model. They are the tiniest bit loose, not enough to keep the pot from making a seal, and I'm thrilled to have found a source for these. I think my IKEA pot was $12 when I bought it and although that's cheap, I hated the idea of tossing it and getting a new one just for lack of a new gasket."
3,A suggestion,"To those listing these gaskets, please put this link on all of your listings to prevent us from ordering the wrong size: […]Nowhere on these makers is there a # cup measure so we're guessing. I only found this link after the fact. Now I have to reorder and have an opened pack of wrong size gaskets."
4,Size Matters,"The filter and gaskets were good quality, arrived on time, but were the wrong size. My fault, as I couldn't remember if my almost 2 year old Bialetti was 2-cup or 3-cup, and the size is not marked on the coffee maker. Since no 2-cup replacement filter was offered, I guessed at 3-cup size. Too small. Amazon Return worked fine, and gave me full credit upon shipping the part back. I even sent a scan of the new vs old filter showing the size difference and suggested if they could send the right size I'd be happy, but got my money back instead.This ""size"" matter is prevalent throughout the hardware mail-order business: everything is computerized, everything is inventoried and sold by part number. No one knows the part dimensions,and if you don't have the part number, you are buying a lottery ticket."
5,Wrong size,"The item arrived in perfect condition but unfortunately was the wrong size for my coffeepot. This seems to be a common situation with the Bialetti coffeepots as I have read other reviews that make a similar observation. This is an issue with the coffeepot itself not with the vendor. The coffeepots don't have an easy identifier to help one pick the right gasket and one has to measure the volume capacity of the pot (which I did) and then make an educated guess as to which one should work. I finally found a gasket at a local kitchenwares store and the perfect fit is in a gasket that is actually for a coffeepot with a larger volume than the one I have, but it worked. The return process to Amazon was painless, so I am happy with the transaction. Thank you."
4,Very good,"With this new gasket I feel I got a new coffee maker, and I just pay a little money for it"
5,Item for Review: Is My Baby All Right?,"Actually I had given my preview of this book just minutes earlier! I'd purchased 3 copies of this book: 2 paperback editions and a hardcover edition! I gave one of the paperback editions away and kept the remaining paperback edition and the hardcover edition! I'm glad to have this book back in my book collection! As I'd stated earlier, this book has made me aware of families of children who have developmental disorders(aka birth defects). I mentioned that I'd been born with a birth defect: congenital hypothyroidism! If I hadn't been born with a congenital disorder, I wouldn't have been as interested in this topic of birth defects!"
5,Advice from the other side,"If you wonder what it's all about and are curious to know what entities who live beyond this world have shared with some of us, look for The Open Door. The automatic writing George Wright provided for his family as it lived through thick and thin in this very real world has much to say to all of us, and the family story is fascinating. It is a keeper and worth revisiting."
3,ProSure Vanilla,"This product did help to increase my appetite slightly and did give me slightly more energy. However, I wish that you carried it in chocolate. The only two flavors were Vanilla and Banana and I didn't think the Banana would be too tasty. I also feel that it is quite expensive for the size of the cans."
3,good size but slides around,"the size is good and the legs are stable but the table top allows the keyboard to slide around. Also, when you press the keyboard keys the keyboard 'gives' due to the lack of stability of the table top."
4,Great for sitting position,"A lot of the X design stands are great for playing while you are standing but the X gets in your way if you like playing while in a seated position - like at an acoustic piano. This stand meets the need of the seated player and can be raised to a higher standing position. It easily collapses for travel and is not very heavy. My major issue with it is its minimum height which is too high for a standard chair or piano stool. If it could go just 1-2"" lower it would be ideal."
4,great design,"Love the design of this it's solid, and open so that the knees don't hit anything. But it is a little tall though. It measures 26 inches at the lowest setting, but add the dimensions of the Yamaha and the keys are at 29 inches which feels a little high for the bench even at its highest adjustment."
3,Good but not great,This stand is good but only if your keyboard is not very heavy. Bought my son a full size keyboard for his birthday along with this stand. The stand sags in the middle when fully extended. Seems solid other than that. He likes the height adjustment also. Overall good just not great.
3,Too High,"I am only 5 foot 3 and at the lowest setting I need a couple more inches for a comfortable reach. This is my first keyboard so I didn't think about measuring for height, but I've never thought of myself as being really short and figured the adjustments would account for everybody. Might rig something up for my feet to lie comfortably flat, but feel like I should have been warned about height limitations."
3,Good stand for keyboards or DJ coffins,"This is a good, inexpensive keyboard stand. Because of its platform top, I intended on using this for a DJ set up (two turntables in flight cases and a mixer) but it did not work, and I returned it because it was too unstable. This would easily support a keyboard -- for what it is originally intended, or perhaps a DJ set up in a coffin."
1,Chinese quality,One leg's interior plastic cap that the steel levelling screw goes in was pushed in too far during factory assembly. This makes the stand wobble since one leg is always shorter than the other 3. The folding supports don't have a stopping point and easily hyper-extend when unfolding them. This makes support very questionable.
4,Good keyboard stand,We bought this for our son's electronic keyboard. He is 8 yrs old and the stand adjusts nicely to fit his size. It was easy to put together and of good quality. I would recommend.
4,Sturdy enough to gig with an 88-key controller,I purchased this keyboard stand some time ago primarily for gigging with my M-Audio 88sx keyboard/controller and I must say I've been quite pleased. It sets up pretty easily and folds up flat for conpact transport to and from gigs. I bought the matching carry case just because I like to keep everything nice and protect it from those late-night-tear-down-and-pack-outs and it's still working fine after 2 years of 2x month gigs. I would recommend this keyboard stand for anyone gigging with a light-to-medium weight keyboard.
2,solid but not great,"This thing weights a ton, but aside from that fact it simply looks more and acts more like a workbench for your DYI projects than to hold a keyboard. It is not very stable and sort of wobbles a bit. It took me all of five minutes after setting not up to realize that you get what you pay for and went ahead and ordered the Nord stand for my pricey Nord keyboard."
1,Unfortunate,"This product was not as expected. The bristles are very stiff and not workable. Some of heads fell of the handles the first time in use.They are not a good product for acrylic paints as the brush does not load properly to alleviate the brittle brush strokes leaving lines in the end product.These were purchased for students using art at a youth level 3-6th grade and unfortunately, although the price is good, the product would not with stand repeated use."
2,Not well developed,"This book can be summed up like this.....this one time, we flew down to Brazil and busted some drug dealers.this one time, we flew down to Colombia and busted some drug dealers.my unit was a bunch of misfits. man we were crazy.this one time, we flew to Miami and busted some drug dealers.I am the worlds expert on wire taps.He runs through a bunch of busts he was part of but you never really feel ike you were there with him while reading because there isn't much detail given. He prefers to list all his accomplishments. When I read Under And Alone I really felt like I was going along with the writer during the story. This one never developed in that way."
3,"A Veteran of Reagan's ""War on Drugs.""","Jerry Speziale is a talented operative and his accomplishments in busting big-time drug smugglers can't be doubted. But the book put me off because of the tone. Speziale is really full of himself and has a massive ego. He seems more interested in trying to flash his bravado than in protecting the public. He did make great strides in worming his way into the workings of the Colombian drug cartels, but I wonder what it was worth. When you bust a major drug smuggling ring, another one will take its place. As long as there's a market for drugs, there will be people interested in smuggling them. As long as a country (like Colombia) is poor and has a high birthrate, there will be no shortage of criminals who will kill for pennies."
4,Pleased,I was very pleased with the shape the book arrived in and how promptly it was shipped. I would highly recommend buying from Amazon.
1,The boys who cannot even sing,"Bla, bla, bla, all the girls who reviewed this unfortunate album are completely ""off"". Is it so hard to recognize what IS quality and what is NOT? These Take That guys do not even know how to sing. Being a professional musician, I can hear the mistakes in their vocals. The accompanying music is not made by them, the boys I think never held a guitar in their hands. This is not music anymore, it`s just calculated by cunning managers in order to fit in the female tastes. Handsome, or rather ""pretty"" boys must catch the eye of every girl and it doesn`t matter what musical skills the boys have... It`s just business, not music... Girls, open your eyes and ears - try to search for art, not for goods..."
5,"Everything changes, but they...","I think that ""Everything Changes"" is great CD i ever heard! I will never forget them & their wonderful albums ""Take That & Party"", ""Everything changes"", ""Nobody Else"" & ofcourse my favourite CD of hits ""Greatest Hits""! I like all boys but that is my list : 1Robbie Williams-brilliant 2Gary Barlow-very very good 3Mark Owen-very good 4Howard Donald-good 5Jason Orange-not so good My recomindation is - Don't waste your time & buy this CD right NOW!"
1,Skip the castles in Spain,"Synopsis from back of book:Love for such a man could lead only to disaster! Beauty and innocence were rare qualities in a woman in the turbulent times of eleventh-century Spain, but Madelon del Rivas y Montevides possessed both. Although desired by many men, she had fallen in love with the dashing Valentin Maratin, the man who had saved her from being sold into slavery but who was a mortal enemy of her beloved brother. Loyalty to her family struggled in her heart with passion, but there was room for only one. And soon she found herself plunged into a world of lies, intrigue . . . and murder.Personal commentary:I found the backdrop of eleventh-century Spain somehow more interesting than the characters. The heroine was ok, I guess --- even her rather blind loyalty to her brother was rather workable --- however, neither she nor any of the other characters really caught my attention. Pass on this one."
2,just okay - a little disappointing,"They are just okay. I am not thrilled with any of them. They are a little grainy. They are also not perforated, so you have to be careful when removing them from the binding. They are oversized too, so they require a regular first class stamp. I would look for a different set if you can find one."
1,What a rip-off,"If you have any sense, don't buy this phone. I paid $700 for this phone when it first came out. After the first three months the mouth piece went dead. I got another one and it went all staticy so I had to send it back. The camera has never taken a decent picture and recently I dropped it and the screen damaged. I called to get it repaired and they want to charge me $179. That's almost $1000 for a cell phone. I ask you, who doesn't drop their cell phone at least once?"
1,Throwaway Piece!!!!!!!!!!,"Guys,Do not take this sheet piece for GOD sake. I am repenting on it :( please take my advice. Thanks."
1,wrong phone,I had to return the item because in the description it was not made clear that the phone was not compatable with Verizon's cellular network. I ended up buying the phone directly from verizon.
2,Terrific concept poor execution.,"I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years. IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited. The device can be used for phone calls, calendars, web browsing, email, IM (ICQ, AOL, etc .. ), internet radio stations, document editing, games, modem for the laptop... and that is just the beginning.So why only two stars?? and why poor execution? Very poor voice call quality, reported by many and totally unacceptable!!! Luckily for me and some others; one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution -- open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil. It worked, but it should never had to be necessary.Also screens are week. Drop on the hard service will break it. Luckily for"
5,"Good Palm, Large Phone","I have had this phone for over a year and was pleased with every aspect of it, other than its size. For anyone shopping for a PDA and wants it to have phone and internet capability you realy can not go wrong with this one, especialy since the price has gone down dramaticaly after the introduction of the Treo 650 which if you have the money has some nice upgrades that would have made my life easier."
1,"This phone is a peice of garbage, especially with Cingular","I purchased a Treo 600 when it first came out. That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650. I was on Cingular with both phones. Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had. I'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me, I decided to cancel my service with Cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. I've gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS. Palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now????"
2,T. Jones,"I enjoy the features of the phone, however there are too many kinks.I am on my second replacement since Mar '05. The first phone had a mysterious orange blob that seemed to migrate on the screen, and a strange humming. The replacement worked for one month and also has a strange hum. The third phone is in route via mail.I have not had any problems with Cingular. They don't seem surprised by my complaints and promptly send replacements. However, I am looking into purchasing a Blackberry, instead."
2,I'm waiting for my 4th Treo...,"Think twice before you buy this. My first and second Treo 600s had identical problems, where they couldn't find the network for some reason, and the answer button wouldn't work. I got the first one in February 05, and the 1st replacement in April 05. The second replacement came a week later. Now, this one has developed these orange pixels [http://discuss.treocentral.com/archive/index.php/t-51494.html], and Sprint is going to replace this one. I will note that Sprint has only replaced my phone with refurbished phones, so I can just imagine that I'm just waiting on my replacement phone, which is just Joe Schmoe's broken phone that has the same darn problems. I just hope that all of these problems keep happening within the warranty period. If you can, buy the warranty."
1,Phone very unreliable,Phone has excellent features but has bad reception. Just after a month (right after the store exchange policy expired) the charger is not working. Some loose connection may be. I read somewhere else that others are having similar issues. It is frustating to have your cellphone breakdown because of the charger issue. How can I recommend this to anyone with this kind of issues ?
1,3rd try = Junk,"This is the 3rd piece of junk treo i have been given. I have suffered through spontaneous reboots, dropped calls, locking screens, you name it. Now the latest is screen bleeding that no one will cover. This phone is junk."
1,Palm not supporting it's product,"This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called T-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. Still didn't work. I called back on satuday 02/04/2006, Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a ""premium exchange option"" and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. I called back on the following Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday.Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday. I asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not."
5,Had it for a Year,"I have heard a lot of bad comments about this product. I think the problem is that there have been different versions of the Treo 600. But the one I had was perfect, had it for a year and never gave me a problem, even dropped it a few times. I recently got my Treo 650 and gave the 600 to a friend; this one is so much better. I'm happy :)."
4,It is not good nor bad,I bought this phone 2 months back. This looks good and it has more functionality of PDA and also works as a good mobile phone. The concern here is some time when you make a call it is not getting disconnected and we need to switch off the mobile mode.The speaker phone quality is good and talk time is also good.I recommend you can buy this but see for better option also.
3,Phone Good - T-Mobile Service Aweful,The pda and its features are very good but the phone does not work well with T-Mobile. I'm on my third treo 600 with T-Mobile and the service is aweful Everywhere!
1,This might as well have been a toy phone,"I got this phone and put the money into it so that I could add some handy software and have an all-in-one piece. This was the most pathetic phone I have ever had. I replaced it a total of 5 times before I just made T-mobile send me a completely unrelated phone. I spent so much money to get so little. The phone with just lock up all of the time, would not get service randomly that was unrelated to the service provider, it would need to be reset daily and then would constantly have to be backed up in fear of losing information and having to do a hard reset. I do not recommend this phone for a toy for a baby, much less for a user who really wants to have some sort of function other than looking at the pretty buttons."

3,"""The Honeymoon Suite""- Buterfly Child","I recently purchased this CD, used, with the impresion that in wast the band ""Honeymoon suite"" and the name of the CD was ""Buterfly child"". When I recieved the CD, I found that the name of the band is Buterfly Child and the name of the CD is The Honeymoon Suite. I was disapointed, but I decided to listen, It is actully pretty good. If you choose to purchse the CD, Beware that it is not actully Honeymoon Suite, but a band called Buterfly Child, but a nice listen none the less."

3,Check temperature rating....,"These are rated 2.5 amp up to 25C/72F.... Mine worked fine for a week then melted, when I called KB customer support they told me of the low temperature rating and told me I would need a 5 amp model because the 2.5 amp one is only rated 2.5 amps up to 25C/72F.... Ugh, we keep the house 75 degrees in the winter it overheated.... By the way our fan motor is 1.5 Full Load Amps."

4,Simply said: Very good,"Since I was a kid, Randolph Scott has always been my cowboy-hero. In spite of I was NOT allowed to see his films at that time, they were prohibited for children under 16 years, I have later seen qui te a lot of them, and most of them satisfying, and a handful very very good to my opinion. Unfortunately,I was never lucky to find any books or magazines etc. with him, until I this yearfound that AMAZON had the material I really had been loo king for (I live in Denmark, so we don`t see much of such stuff around here), too small a country in this respect, so I have lately received A FILM BIO graphy, with 200-300 hundred of pictures from his films, together with his movie-carrier from film no. 1 - to his last in 1962 no. 100. I must say, I really was surprised of the book`s content, it was exactly what I will call: ALL ABOUT THAT MAN - and who can ask for more. YES, that book will have my full recommandation, that`s for sure - if you are a RANDOLPH SCOTT fan, like me."
5,"Merely excelent, great work by Jeff Brim Crow.","As a matter of fact it is a great book on Randolph Scott, our favourite big screen cowboy heroe. I recommend it.Mario Peixoto Alves"
4,"Blotto, at their finest","For those who only know ""lifeguard"", this is a quick look into the world of Blotto, Albany, NY's finest export. Listening to ""She's Got A Big Boyfriend"" or ""Metalhead"" brings me back to my college days, crammed into a local watering hole, watching Cheese, Broadway, Blanche and the gang, biting the heads off of a cabbage patch doll. If you appreciate intelligent humor, give it a listen."
4,"Funny, and you can dance to it.","I admit it. I saw just about every show Blotto did at the Chance (in Poughkeepsie, NY), up to the fire. A high energy club band with a wild sense of humor. Great guitar work from Broadway & Bowtie."
3,"Great music, mediocre recording quality",I used to see Blotto a few times a year in the mid 80s. They were great fun. This album brings back all the great memories. I can't believe I still remember the words to these songs after not hearing them for over 25 years.The downside of this album is the recording quality. Where is the high-end? It sounds like someone threw a wet blanket over the speakers. Maybe the master tapes were actually standard cassette tape. It needs to be remastered through an Aphex Aural Exciter.
1,Angel Menendez Review,I haven't never read this book. I need to see the table of contents of this book. How can I know if it's a good book. I need to get a score of 8 points in the IELTS examination. Thank you.
3,"Pricey, but contains helpful advice","This short video and accompanying booklet contain some valuable hints that may help you during the test. The hints will help you focus on your task during the writing section and the oral examination, and will also save you precious time during the reading comprehension examination.However, the pack has many shortcomings, too. It does not contain much practice material (there's nothing at all for the listening comprehension part), and thus it forces you to look for such somewhere else (happily, there's ample practice material on the Internet). Besides that, its entire focus is on the Academic version of the exam, while the General exam (which features different reading and different essay types) is totally ignored.The bottom line is that although the advice in the video and the booklet might end up helping you to one extent or the other, the package is simply too costly for what it delivers."
4,How to get a good score!,"I am an IELTS teacher. This CD-Rom and book are excellent in that they really help students to understand the requirements of the IELTS test. It is full of helpful suggestions and if the instructions and tips contained in this publication,are carefullyfollowed and practiced it will definitely prove to be a very useful study aid. My students think it is so helpful that I decided to write this review so that others can benefit from this CD-Rom and book."
1,A Bit Pricey for The Quality of This Book!,"I am very disappointed that IELTS tutor does not provide with comprehensive exercises especially in Listening and Speaking. It's very essential to practice Listening with a CD-ROM. Moreover, the book's fonts are so tiny and does not have the helpful tips and lots of exercises. After studying the book and CD, the student is left without a skill on how to attack the test efficiently and effectively. A waste of time and money!"
1,I wouldn't buy it,Contains inaccuracies - there's plenty more books on the market which have better info than this one.
4,It will teach you HOW!,"This study kit is vry, very useful. It will help you to know what to do to get a good score. It has helped me!"
3,Special features........,The product details list a commentary and two featurettes. These aren't present on my copy. Is there more than one version?
4,Captain America The First Avenger,Chris Evans does an excellent job as our hero Captain American. The story has lots of action. The villain is the evil Red skull played delightfully by Hugo Weaving. This movie tells the story how Captain America came about and his first great adventure. A fun movie that will be enjoyed. See it.
5,The 1st. Avenger,"Great movie! Can't go wrong with Blue-ray, DVD, & Digital Copy! 3 for the price of 1. Watch it on your PS3/Blue-ray player. On your DVD player. Or on your computer/ ipad, iPhone, ect."
5,American Movie brought to life.,"Excited when it was announced coming to theaters, excited when the premier was in town. Enjoyable family movie. Knew that when the DVD was to be released I was making that purchase and pre-ordered with Amazon. Thank you for making life a little easier."
4,Captain America,"Captain America has great special effects, a fairly fast paced story and some great performances particularly from Chris Evans and Tommy Lee Jones. The highlight for me has to be the ending which was a very pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting much but I'd happily watch another Captain America film."
5,reviews,I found this movie very entertaining and good for the choldren and family. The beginning lost me but soon found the story line.
4,Beyond my expectations,"I did not think that the movie would be this good. Making the world war II era as the background of the movie, made me think that the tech of special effects for this movie would be minimum, but I was mistaken. I like the story line, the choice of actors and the smooth transition to become the first avenger. We must have this DVD as part of our super heroes collection."
4,A Fool For a Decent Super Hero,"Captain America didn't get a whole lotta buzz in my home....until The Avengers came out in 3D. After that, I was compelled to go back and watch all of the individual Avenger Titles like Hulk, Thor, Iron Man 1 & 2....I really just relaxed and gave into the guilty pleasure of a mindless action flick. Its not as great as the other Avenger characters films, but its still good. You won't be displeased. I don't have to watch every movie looking for some deeper meaning . . . some movies are just plain fun to watch with friends. So please, pass me the popcorn and the remote - its Movie Night!"
5,Great Movie,Helps with the background story of the Avengers yet stands alone as a good movie.. I highly reccomend it if you are into the Marvel heroes
4,Great Movie,"As a fan of the comics it is great to see this character visualized in a movie that is not completely cheesy. Late 70's and early 80's visions of Captain America were much lower budget and under visualized verisons.The story was a great installment as we waited for The Avengers to assemble in their power/action packed movie.The acting abilities of Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving and Stanley Tucci show in this movie. You will either love it or hate it, but either way its a really good watch!"
4,Love the action,"I love a good action movie, and this definitely was the one for me. It is put on my rewatch list."
5,Awesome,"Love this movie, and I got a great deal on the two disc option over Cyber Monday, the quality is great in the Blu-ray"
2,Not a good Marvel Movie,"This movie had a strong beginning, however the bulk of the movie was either just actions scenes or flashes of action scenes. There was very little story line. I love Marvel movies but this was a disappointment."
2,Too Hokey For me,"Thin plot, so so acting & some of the sets just looked fake. Watch a rerun of one of your favorites instead."
3,Not one of Marvels better movies but OK,"Chris Evans did a great job playing Cap.The CGI to make Chris look small was great.The CGI to make Chris look super was horrible/lacking.I think a lot of people tried hard to make this movie but the directing/scripting was par.What was with Neal McDonough, he's a pretty good acter but he sure didn't do dum dum any credit. I always pictured dum,dum Dugan a lot tougher, Neal made him look like a slouch and he sure didn't make the handlebar mustache look tough...Howling commandos, ok at best, definitely not 'howling'I wish the movie was more dynamic, super, amazing. It was humdrum and disappointing."
1,Captain America fake,The DVD was bogus. It wouldn't play.Captain America: The First AvengerLikelihood of my using this site for future purchases = 0. Don't know how you validate sellers but you've got a few bugs.
1,"Boring film, bad script, poor acting","This is one of the worst films I have ever watched. If Hollywood wants to throw millions away, they could at least accomplish something worthwhile by giving it to a food bank or homeless shelter. This film drags on and on, the script is boring and the acting bad. The action is really nothing more than special effects. All in all, a sorry excuse for a superhero film. My advice, if there really are plans for a sequel, is that the makers study Sky Captain and the World of Tomrrow, The Rocketeer, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, if they want to see what a good modern version of a old time cliff-hanger looks like."
2,Boring and ugly.,I didn't really care for any of the action scenes or the characters. I'm also usually fond of Shelley Johnson's cinematography but this film is butt-ugly.
1,Mediocre non marvel,"I don't see why this would get better reviews than lets say the green lantern. I usually like long movies with a lot of story in them but this one just bored me the whole way through. There wasn't enough suspense or enough action to make it a thrilling or even a half way good film. I'm glad I only paid four bucks to see it because I won't be buying it at all. Chris Evans was definitely not the right choice for Captain America, he just didn't make it believable for me."
1,Possibly the worst Marvel movie.,"Let's start with the good acting. There is little to none. The dialogue is kinda like something a bunch of high end science fiction nerds would write, but they have no clue how anyone talks. The lead character is corny and a boy scout, the lead female has more stones than this guy. The villain is laughable, Mr. Smith cannot do a German accent, schedule=shedge-ule in his accent. The dialogue is bad, the acting is worse, the plot is worse than either one, and its overall a boring mess. IF you're curious, rent it. But don't buy it.On a side note, that no-name actor from ""Walking Tall"" wears a bowler hat constantly. I mean everywhere, he wears it in prison, at the bar, in BATTLE WITH BULLETS FLYING, when they are rappelling, everywhere. It's hilarious."
1,Terrible,"Just plain awful. This movie really sucked. The first twenty minutes was good, but it was all downhill from there."
3,Okay...,"In short, the movie isn't bad... but it just felt like all of the action was a glorified trailer. And Red Skull was kind of a panzy the whole entire time. Yup. That's my critique of this movie. This is an action super hero movie... why think too hard. lol"
1,"WOW, this is bad","I have never seen a superhero movie this bad. This is worse than Fantastic Four and even the terrible Green Lantern.I find myself cannot help fast forwarding in order not to fall asleep. The story is extremely predictable -- and I'm not talking about by the standard of suspense movies but rather action movies. The characters are unsophisticated black and white. The development has been very slow, with too many unimportant, boring events chained together. Even the computer generated scenes look terribly unreal."
2,not that good.,"The first Spider-man film was much better then all the Marvel films that came after. The story pace was terrible, Capt. America starts out slow and about half way through speeds up as if the director ran out of time. So, plenty of action towards the end. Some of the special effects of Steve as a skinny weakling were terrible. Most noticeably when he is in the back seat of the car, his head was way to big, then he looked like a hobbit and then almost normal. It seems there is a mad rush to release these Marvel character films before the ""Avengers"" film release later this year. So, they are sacrificing quality, details, good writing, good editing and good acting for a quick buck. Thor and the Hulk were other examples of weak films. Chris Evans played Johnny (the human torch) in the Fantastic Four and now Capt. America??! There are ten thousand other actors to choose from!!!"
2,"Boring, dumb, flashy, not well written at all.","I was so excited to see this, but was SO disappointed. The writing and plot are just terrible. The story isn't well-told, so you end up not caring about Captain America or the Red Skull or ANYTHING at all!!! I LOOKS good - good effects and some action and stuff. And I liked the touches of the old Captain suit and good ol' Stan Lee's cameo. But for the most part, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I thought it was terrible."
2,NOT A GOOD MARVEL MOVIE!!!!!!,"The story on CAPTAIN AMERICA is really not inspired.....Got a lot of explosions, fights but NO STORY.....well, in my opinion almost ALL MARVEL movies could had better storys.....The HULKs and this one are the WORST of all........NOT SO GOOD, NOT A GOOD MARVEL MOVIE!!!!! try Spider Man and X MEN, by far the best MARVEL put on movies!!!!!!"
2,Childish and Boring,"A movie of this kind should be 60 to 90 minutes and not 120. This is an OK movie if you are under the age of 14, and boring if you are over it."
2,Samuel Jackson in EVERY movie?,"He was in this one...It would have been nice if the bad guy had seemed like a bigger threat than he was...I mean come on, blow up a small city to show us what you can do....pfffft...nada. Melty Cube.I must admit I have never read the comic and don't know anything about Captain America, but I can say I really don't want to learn more.This was a totally forgettable movie. Meh."
2,Hit the snooze.,"I was so looking forward to watching this on my new tv. I missed it while it was in the movies. I'm so angry that I actually paid so much for the DVD. My wife and I enjoy comic book movies, but this one was a stinker. We were so bored that we thought the movie lasted three hours.It's not like the actors did a poor job, I think it was the plot and/or the writing. Maybe I should view it again, which I'm sure I will. This could have the same effect on me as did The Fifth Element. Hated it the first time I seen it, but liked it after watching it a couple more times. I'm slow like that. LOL."
4,"Welcome Back, Cap!","Once in a while, Hollywood gets it right. ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) is nostalgic fun. Director Joe Johnston doesn't let CGI overwhelm this engaging World War II comic-book adventure. Chris Evans delivers a sincere performance in the title role - well-matched by Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci (doing his best Maximilian Schell imitation) and a memorably villainous Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull. The Marvel superhero finally receives the A-list production he richly deserves."
3,Why all the foul language?,"What is it these days that everything has to be laced with foul langauge? Otherwise, this would have been a very uplifting, thoroughly enjoyable, very patriotic movie."
2,yawn,"I keep trying to watch it and I honestly have fallen asleep each time. The first hour won 3 stars, then I keep falling asleep. I have watched the ending when I woke up, but the movie is like a bedtime story."
4,They Finally Got It Right!,"Is Captain America: The First Avenger perfect? No. Is it the best live-action interpretation of the character? You betcha! In fact, of all the Avenger movies, this one is my favorite so far (though I DO love all of them). For those that like storylines, I would recommend watching this film first, then Iron-Man, then Incredible Hulk, then Iron-Man 2, then Thor. This film makes those other four make more sense as there are clues and elements (and character links) that show up in those movies that are shown here.On the film itself, I found it to be dramatic fun! The 3D effects in it I found satisfactory as well as the bonus features. I loved this film in the movies and I like it here. Would recommend the film itself no matter the format!"
3,Captain America,It was pretty good...I expected it to be a little more corny but I enjoyed it. Probably wouldn't watch it again.
4,Great Movie,"I don't know anything about Capt America, meaning I didn't grow up reading the comics or anything like that, so I'm taking the movies for what I see.That being said, the family and I liked it, Scenes seemed real enough meaning CGI or green screen wasn't obvious enough to take me out of the story.3D, well done but not a lot there, but not your ""This scene is for 3D"" moments which I hate, why? because it takes me out of the story.I pre-ordered it at a lower than normal price, which for me was great, I keep the 3D and Blu-Ray and let kids view the DVD"
3,Not as good as expected,"I had heard nothing but good things about this movie. In fact, I heard it was one of the best movies this year. Of course we hear that about a lot of different movies but the weird thing with this movie is that I hadn't heard really anything negative about it at all. So I went into this expecting a lot and came out kinda ""meh"".The plot is decent at best. It's entirely predictable but that's not the problem to me. The problem is that it's just kinda the same thing we've seen over and over. There really isn't anything different that stands out to me, besides the beginning and the end. Sure it was entertaining at times but more times than not I would ask ""Really?"" Whether Captain America was doing song and dance (one scene) or mysteriously comes out alive of certain situations, it just kinda left me blase.This isn't a terrible movie by any stretch of the imagination but it wasn't amazing to me. The main actor is really good and was fun to watch."
5,Excellent,"In my opinion, the director accomplished to transport the most important aspects of this character and create a great super-hero movie. I confess that I doubt if the sequel can be as good as this one."
3,Captain America: The First Avenger,"Captain America put the finishing touches on a triumphant summer for Marvel that included hits Thor and X-Men: First Class and successfully bridged the gap to next summer's much anticipated Avengers movie. Directed by Joe Johnston and starring a surprisingly heroic Chris Evans in the title role, Captain America plays out the origin story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny but determined military recruit who signs up for a secret super-soldier program, only to be faced by the threat of the evil HYDRA organization and its leader Red Skull, another recipient of the super-soldier treatment. Though I was initially a bit unsure what exactly to expect from the film, I enjoyed it. It's solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment with pulpy action, a retro vibe, and some fine acting performances. Even if Captain America wasn't your favorite comic hero, chances are you'll have a pretty good time with this movie."
4,Captain America - Blue Ray,"Bought this for my Dad for Christmas and it was a smashing hit. If you love action scenes, this is the movie for you. Makes a great gift for that special guy in your life. (Ladies - don't worry, plenty of eyecandy in it for you as well!)"
5,DVD Captain America,I ordered this DVD for my grandson for Christmas and it arrived just in time for the holiday. My grandson was very pleased to receive it for Christmas and I was pleased that it arrived in time. thank you for a job well done.K. in Michigan
5,Loved this movie!,I loved this movie because they didn't start this series off with Captain America being all modern. And this was a great segue into the Avengers movie. Well done.
3,A bit of a let down,"I was hoping this would be better than Thor, but it wasn't. I think the whole movie seemed rushed. They pushed through the plot to get the character into Avengers."
4,I didn't know CAPTAIN AMERICA was sooo cute,"I thought the movie was okay. My screen was kind of dark and harder to see through this movie for some reason, but... the guy playing Captain America was soo cute it made it worth it."
5,awesome,"Love the movie. I am always a fan of the most recent Marvel movies, I would definitely recommend it to someone else."
4,"Really Good, but Not Great Movie","I really thought this movie was almost great, and it was definitely one of the best comic book/super hero movies to come along in a long time. To me, it worked on every level, but it was just too much anecdote and montage - it could have used more story development. Overall, one I've already seen multiple times and plan on watching more."
3,good movie too expensive,"The movie was good but it was too expensive. If I remember, I rented this and I won't do it again."
5,Awesome Movie,I grew up reading comic books. Also love the Comic movie genre. Captain America is one of the better movies made...sometimes it is a hit or miss and this one was a hit!!!!!
1,Dull as dishwater,"The only thing I liked about this film were the end credits. What a dull mess of a film, with the blandest characters ever."
1,I want that wasted time back,"The action in this movie is pretty good, but isn't that the case with most action movies?? The movie is supposed to be set back in WWII time frame but if it wasn't for the costume design you'd never know it. Frequent occurances of out of place dialogue and casting for the time frame, I understand the ""it's a movie about a superhero so how real should it be?"" argument but that shouldn't be an excuse for not even making an attempt to be in context. Also I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the special effects to me looked awful at best. I actually laughed audibly during the scene where steve rogers chases (and catches) a vehicle. Unfortunately, as if that wasn't enough, this movie is on rails. No plot twist and turns, you know exactly what's going to happen and right when it's going to happen. Characters are super shallow even for an action film. There are far better movies out there, even if the goal is to just waste time."
1,Disappointing Superhero movie,"In spite of the high quality of recent superhero films, this movie seems rushed. The visuals and effects are not up to modern standards. Chris Evans only has one memorable scene and it is his very last one in the movie. The editing is sloppy (see the hangar chase), which is totally unacceptable for something with this budget."
2,meh,"Just not very good. Cool intro and premise but epic fail after about 15 minutes. Good actor selection, nice opening script but just bad after that. Who's the target audience?"
2,Very poor movie,"What a disapointing movie. From the super Nazi to the Captain himself. The effects in the movie were quite good but the story and the acting was terrible. Even Tommy Lee Jones was a disapointment. That in itself says something about the screen play. What a weak tie in to Ironman with SL Jackson showing up in the end. So I am guessing there is an Ironman Captain America and the Hulk meet Captain jack Sparrow and harry Potter sequel heading our way, with a cameo appearance by Shrek."
2,Ok as Comedies go,The jokes were too few for a 2 hour movie and you have to wait until the end for the funniest scene where the names of the cities are painted on the bombs.Going on a stealth operation into German occupied territory under cover of darkness carrying a shiny shield with the American flag painted on it was hilarious too.Most of the movie repeated the same jokes over again.Not recommended .. what do you mean; it wasn't meant to be a comedy!!!
1,terrible,It was just a terrible movie. Very plain and boring. I suggest viewers to watch any of the x-men episodes instead.
5,AS awesome as the COMICS!,This was the best movie I have seen in a VERY LONG TIME! It was fun and kept with the spirit of the comics.... Reading these reviews I can tell those who read the comics from those who haven't! I am sooo glad they didn't change the character or the story to be more Hollywood.... I would Have been devastated!
3,A Nice Surprise,"In my quest to watch films in the Avengers continuity before I watch ""The Avengers"" itself, Captain America stood out as a nice surprise in these films. It actually has a very old fashioned ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" style feel to it with plenty of action and nice performances mixed throughout. Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull was certainly a ton of fun and Captain America's origin story mixed with America's war bond advertisements and USO short films is very interesting. One of my favorite bits in this movie is how it ties into the Avengers continuity very nicely (with several elements having a massive effect on a certain post credits scene for a movie about a Norse god and possibly a massive effect on the plot of ""The Avengers"" itself). I don't have too many complaints about this one and I can't wait to see how Captain America shapes up in the Avengers."
5,What a movie!!!,I really enjoy comic book movies. This on was phenomenal and held my attention to the end. If you are a fan - watch this one!!!
4,Real American Hero,"Great movie even better in 3D, really enjoying the 3D experience at home, better than the theater and I don't have to wait in line for concessions."
5,Great movie,Really enjoyed this movie. Great start to the Avengers series when you watch them in order with the other movies.
5,Captain America,"Great movie! I love that this film is uplifting, and a really great piece leading into everyone's favorite -- The Avengers! It did have quite a few swear words, some scary images for the youngsters...but altogether a great family film."
4,It's an A for Captain America,"so good to watch an enjoyable movie full of action, fun, a touch of glamour, including the spangled banners etc. thoroughly entertaining without too much blood and bone focus. a nice lead into the rest of the ""marvel team"""
3,Redneck Review,Acting: A+Action: B+Plot: C+Ending: BSex Scenes: NoneLanguage: ModerateViolence: B+ and alot of itWorth a rental or Purchase: C+I had hoped for alot more. Some will like it but those expecting good spiderman or batman movie from the comics Captain America falls short.
2,Review of 3D vs. 2D,"We need about 1,000,000 reviews of this product to point out that the 3D was ""created"" in post production. That conversion is very disappointing. To the other reviewer that also only reviewed the 3D aspects, and gave it 3 stars (3.5 stars), I would disagree. If Avatar and Tron are at 5-stars for 3D, this is a negative 7 stars.To give an example, i saw it in 2D in the theater, and loved it. My wife missed it then but we both watched the 3D blu-ray last night (7000-series Samsung 60"" & Oppo), and my wife hated the movie. I'm 99% sure it's only because of the terrible 3D effects. I must say I pretty much hated it also, this time around.To put a monitary value on it, if I had the choice of ONLY buying 3D or 2D, I'd pay $8 extra to buy the 2D.I'm being generous with the 2-stars just to call attention to the problem - but I don't want to ""sink"" the ratings for a great movie. Lesson Learned: Never again will i buy a 3D movie without insuring it wasn't a post-production conversion."
2,lacking in character development,The movie starts off with some relatively interesting characters that just get flatter and flatter as the movie progresses.What the movie has:- explosions- car chases- gun fire by people who have exceptionally bad aim
2,captain america,I brought this two disc blue ray hoping for two things it would come with the box and two disc. I only got one blue ray in a cd case. I wouldn't buy anything from this seller again.
1,Fit for a 8 year old.,"No imagination regarding plot, too predictable. I would not recommend this movie for anyone older than 8. I get it these movies are meant for a younger crowd but this one was a real dud."
2,not so cool,"first, i saw the trailer and i thought this would be an awesome movie, and maybe i expected too much, cause when i watched it, it was totally BORING. In general, i didn't enjoy to see this movie once more time like unusual.... come on marvel, you can do better than this ( thor, spider-man, iron man, hulk,.... 4 example )"
1,HOLLYWOOD DROPS THE BALL YET AGAIN,"HOLLYWOOD DOES NOTHING BUT TAKE COMIC BOOK AND VIDEOGAME CHARACTERS CONCEPTS AND TURNS SOMETHING THAT WAS GREAT AND TURN IT INTO TRASH...(EXAMPLE: DAREDEVIL, SPIDERMAN, RESIDENT EVIL CAPTAIN AMERICA, HULK TOMB RAIDER, SUPERMAN, GI JOE, ELECTRA, ETC.)"
1,"In 3D, and in story, a let down of an icon","This is a truly dreadful portrayal by the studio of a Marvel Comics icon from my youth. The plot (if you can find one) is banal, but even worse is the 3D presentation. The 3D presentation is bizarre. Imagery: it's completely out of perspective. It's like characters are digitally 'pasted' on to backgrounds, apparently many feet apart, when the perspective should be a fraction of that. Weird and amateurish. Software gone mad, no human control or common sense. There are scenes with a long arm or other object pointing right out of the screen, for no reason. Its sepia colors, no doubt to give the impression of the 1940s WWII, are odd. In comparison to other Blu Ray 3D releases recently, this doesn't hack it - at all."
1,Pure pap,Vapid empty headed pap. Paid $3.99 to rent this while home sick and bored with everything I had on Netflix streaming. Now I feel embarrassed for contributing to this movie's success. I'm also embarrassed for the 124 people (as of writing this) that gave the movie 5 stars (4 star average with 277 reviews?). No wonder Hollywood shows no real inclination to worry about plot and character development. Just pack the movie with eye candy and CGI and the lemmings will march off to see it.
1,Embarassing,"Jingoistic, sanitized (total racial harmony in the 1940s...), militaristic, unrealistic (even for a cartoon, and that's saying something), idiotic schmalz. Every character and setting is completely unbelievable. Even as far as comic book movies go, this one's a dud. Captain America has a stupid costume and lame powers. I wish the Germans had shot at him instead of his shield. Would've made the movie shorter."
1,Crappy Movie,"I was so disappointed with this movie because I really like all the stars in it. The movie was so drawn out and boring; if they had cut out all the BS it would have been under 60 mins. I wish they had more action in this movie, instead they focused to much on how small Steve Rogers was before he becomes Cpt America. Over half of the movie was based on this. I would definately suggest watching it on TV before buying it to see if you like it.Thanks for reading my review."
3,Teen Friendly and Well Crafted,"The movie was well crafted and interesting, even for those of us who thought they knew the story. The ending sets the stage perfectly for the Avengers. As expected with a super hero movie, there is lots of violence that probably makes this a little too scary for anyone under 12. This is a great option for teen movie night, in my opinion. I loved the movie and hope to seeMarvel's The Avengerssoon as well. Go Marvel!"
4,Nice Holly-weird adaptation,"In my youth I read comics to escape certain periods of my life. Captain America, like many other of my favorite heros have been brought to the screen in recent years. In many ways it is nice to see them come to life in a newer form. Evan's film is a lovely adaptation full of action and adventure."
3,Got it to complete the Avengers,"This movie was very good but not great. Chris Evans did a good job. The story was nice and I really did like the movie. Only problem was that everything was too easy for Captain America. He bulldozed past everything with his shield, tanks included. Even the Red Skull who is also a super soldier was defeated easily after running in fear of Captain America for most of the movie. I had to get it to complete the Avengers build up stories though so I did."
3,Worth a watch,"This movie was just ok for me. I really wanted a great movie, but I think it was dumbed down for the sake of selling some toys. The story was there, it could have used some more action. It seemed a little cheezy at times."
3,I couldn't give it 2 1/2 stars!!,I found this movie to be a complete waste of an afternoon and $19.99. I was highly anticipating this to be a good well thought out action movie but it fell way short of my expectations. I also expected the Blu-ray visuals and special effects to be great but... not so much. This movie is just barely OK but I definitely wouldn't put it on my movies to buy list at least not until it hits the $5.00 bin.
4,Follows the comics much better,This new Captain America Movie follows the story line of the Comics much more closly than the previous movies that were made it jumps the story line a bit to bring you up a step closer to the next movie they plan to release but was done very well and incorperates a lot of the varance of the comic into the one movie. All in all very good.
3,OK Not Great,Its starts a bit slow & then non stop action. It was ok for the money but this type of movie needs a better villain. This is a great movie for the younger crowd but I need a reason for the hero and I dont believe the reason was clear.
4,Captain America,It was a breath of fresh air to see a super hero who stayed pretty close to the original story....
5,excellent,i was really worried about this movie n got cause i just purchase 3d so i had to find something in 3d to watch and wow this movie is excellent in 3d the story and vivid 3d 1080p was serperb not to memtion with my dlp mitsu this movie is a must worth it.
3,Marvel Comics superhero movie,Gotta love the real to life comics great special effects very colorful lots of action and not for the little ones to watch unless you want to wake up to a super kill shot to the nuts some morning in your sleep! I was happy to pick my copy up for a very low price [...] very good deal cardboard sleeve though.
3,OK entertainment; could have been much better,"I wanted to like ""Captain America"" but the movie's faults made this a one-off--good enough to watch once, but probably not one of those that the viewer will watch over and over again over the years. The characters had potential but did not live up to this potential. Steve Rogers and Peggy Clark have a chaste little attraction going, but it never matures into anything of note in the film. Steve Rogers himself lacks depth, and the film could have developed him, and his friend ""Bucky"" much more. The same is true of the villains--they are one-dimensional bad guys and that is pretty much the end of it.The special effects are good, and I applaud that the movie is pretty much true to the original ""Captain America"" story. I just think that this one could have been done better. RJB."
3,America: Heck Yea!,"Another Marvel Superhero flick. This one is good but not great. Really this just makes me anticipate the Avengers film. Marvel has done a good job being patient and releasing the films slowly, taking time to develop each character (Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye) but this one definitely felt the most 'slapped together' of any of them. Regardless, still a highly entertaining movie, but not with the weight in story and acting of the others."
5,Perfect,Arrived factory sealed and in perfect condition popped right into the PS3 and played without flaws. It was worth the money.
4,Captain America: the First Avenger was entertaining and played well on the streaming video,"Captain America: the First Avenger was entertaining from start to finish. The good guys triumph over evil, there is a lot of action and a great set up for the follow on movie The Avengers due to several direct links to future actions and characters in the Avengers. Best of all the streaming video played perfectly on this one – so hopefully Amazon is improving the service."
4,Avengers,"My husband and I love Marvel, and this was the only one we didn't see in the theater. Really like the Stark tie-in, but can Captain America be any more of a goody-two-shoes? I'm much more of a Tony Stark/Dr. Banner girl. Product took forever to get here (two-day shipping my butt), but packaging was good."
4,First Amazon Movie Purchase,"I did not purchase this in HD, but the quality was superb.The movie was good ahnd 48 hrs is more than enough time to watch it.Thanks Amazon! Will definitely rent more in the future. In fact I have cancelled Netflix and switched to Amazon Prime, just makes more sense."
5,Great Movie!,"This was a fantastic movie. The dvd itself is everything i thought it might be. Love the digital copy, play it on itunes all the time. Can't wait for them to make more movies about Captain America."
3,CA Not,"I enjoy war films but I found that Cap America wasn't that great of a film. It's boring in parts, it's too light,to silly and more over the one liners are horrible.Joe has done it again, ruined a good hero.What it needed:* An in-depth view of what a war film should like* Needed to be darker* Keep the character in the pastI expected to see Cap doing battle with his enemies for three films and tie it in with The Avengers.When he wakes up could have been in the beginning of The Avengers not at the end of this film."
4,One of the better super-hero movies,"OK, I admit, I was a huge Captain American fan as a kid, read the comic book, and was a fan. So when I heard this movie was coming out I was really looking forward to it. And I was not disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although seeing Elrond as a bad guy was kind of hard to take. Glad he pulled out the red make-up so I would quit thinking about Elrond. But seriously, the movie is definitely worth watching if you like the super-hero genre. Because Cap is not really a super-hero with special powers except for exceptional strength and endurance as a result of a ""super soldier"" experiment. The costume is toned down so that it looks like a cross between a super-hero costume and regular soldier's uniform. I was just a bit disappointed in the ending which I will not reveal, but it sets up a sequel, I suppose."
4,superheroes,This movie is another in a series of movies that link up with Ironman. It's well done bittersweet ending though. This was a lot of fun to watch visually dark but a great start-up story for Captain America.
2,Disappointed,"Really disappointed by this movie. Too bad, because the other Marvel movies were good and this makes the other ones look amazing."
2,Captain America,The rating is not for the movie. the movie is excellent. the rating is for the condition. it was sent in a CD case not the original case. then I believe it was probably a rental as it has markings on it to that effect
2,Could have been so much more.,"In general, the movie has elements that are high quality. The production is top-notch, the stroy is fine, but the main actors let it down. Chris Evans must be a witch because he's certainly made of wood and the normally-terrific Hugo Weaving was too campy in his portrayal of Red Skull. This movie was so close to being very good, but those two really dragged it down for me."
5,Great Movie,"Bought this in advance of the Avenger's movie. It arrived on time and in great condition. The price was great, I couldn't find it cheaper in the stores.The movie itself was well done and included everything as advertized. The action and the story were paired well with good acting.Only a few scenes that may be suitable for all ages due to being scary, not graphic."
4,I'm glad I watched it.,"I was never very interested in Captain America, thinking he's just a strong guy who waves around a boomerang type shield. I now see what the ""fuss"" is about and this movie has turned me into a fan. I have seen quite a few movies starring Chris Evans and this is probably the best acting I have seen from him. The rest of the cast is very talented and don't disappoint. The storyline was easy to follow and enough action to keep my interest. It also seemed to blend very well with the other Marvel movies (the biggest one obviously being Iron Man). I'm not well versed in the comic book world but overall, I think this was a great movie and I'm glad I finally watched it."
2,Corny,A cornball movie with childish ideas of patriotism and the idea that might makes right. A typical action movie. Word.
5,Captain America Rules,"i was so excited to see this movie, i wished i would of seen the midnight showing. this movie was everything i expected it to be. the origin was excatly like the comic, the actors were awesome. hugo weaving did an excellent red skull and chris evans was fantastic as captain america. this movie was awesome. and the battle between red skull and captain america was outstanding. the only problem i have with this movie is that i wished they wouldof stuck with the original costume but other than that this is my number one superhero movie of the year. marvel you guys did great on coming out with good superhero movies for this year. i do hope that marvel will put out the original captain america movie on dvd soon. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
3,just ok,"People raved to me about this movie but for me it was just ok. I mean it was not bad, do not get me wrong. Good special affexts and good acting, but kinda slow at first. Too much building up the story to get to the main plot."
2,Couldn't finish,"I'm giving this film 2 stars because I simply couldn't sit through the second hour of the film and wanted to give it some benefit of the doubt.What forced me to choose not to finish the film:The film starts out ok, but after the experiment, the film just gets cheesy and stupid. You're greeted by dumb one-liners that aren't funny and the film gets tiring incredibly fast. If the dialogue had been predictable, that would have been fine, but it was unpredictably dumb.Frankly, it seems that whoever wrote the script just thought: ""I've got to get all these different elements of CA in the film - how can I do that as quickly as possible.""I'll say this: if you have a child who has no concept of WW2, military matters, how to hold and fire a gun, and can't understand the English language: they very well might enjoy this film."
3,CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Saw something like it is a cartoon looooong time ago. We did love this movie, but it seemed a little weird somehow. I think maybe we should see it again when it is free to observe what the problem was."
2,Boring,"To be perfectly honest I was expecting more. The action sequences were alright, but there was a total of literally maybe 10 minutes of action in the whole movie. I'm glad I only rented it for $1 at Redbox..."
2,B'lech! Yet another pathetic attempt at a superhero movie,"There are so few good superhero movies out there that yet another pathetic one in Captain America simply waters down the genre even further. From the tacky CGI pasting of the hero's head onto a skinny actor's body, to the Xena Warrior Princess Army commander punching out soldiers and shooting up the set, to the Hulk-inspired action scenes, and the product tie-ins to the Avengers movie, yuck, we'll just seen it all before. Perhaps just sticking to the source material would suit a lot of these attempts at new superhero movies better. Not only is there a lot of wasted space in the movie (the opening sequence for one), but there are also a lot of sub-par actors in the movie. (I know, I know, people don't go to superhero movies to see acting, but still...). I guess for now I will have to stick to my superhero DVD collection (ie: the 1st X-Men, Casshern, The Incredibles, Watchmen, Storm Riders, etc.)"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving. That said, this is a horrible movie. It was slow and predictable as well as cranking out a story that should have been filled out as much as Chris' chest was, unfortunately such was not the case and even Chris' fine physical attributes couldn't make this movie enjoyable. The last 10 minutes were by far the best part. I really wish I could have given this a better review, and if they do have a sequel here's hoping it turns out much better than this one!"
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"First of all, I'm a big superhero, comic book movie fan. I love Batman and Superman. I also like X-Men and Iron Man. I really thought this movie would be awesome, but the plot is thin. The action scenes become exhausting to watch and seem to make up the bulk of the movie. It also doesn't tie into modern day until the very end, which made it that much less interesting. I watched Thor after this and thought it was a way better movie."
3,Quite Boring,I found the movie boring and could not wait for it to be over. One time watch for me. Video quality is good though.
1,not happy,movie was great but the video stopped a few times had to reset where it ended have not watch a single amazon movie that not a promblem have no promblem with you tube should went to red box amazon almost as bad as crackle movies i have a good internet connection amazon troubling quality bob
1,worst movie I have seen offlate,"fell for 5* hype and rented it (so glad didnt buy or see it in theaters)like other 1* reviewers have waited till 1/2 way of the movie to see if its gets interesting...so bad, no plot, average action....the GIJoe Cobra movie had better plot and visualsreturning it unfinished as its utter waste of time"
1,A Real Snoozer,"I fell asleep on the movie. I just kept saying I know that this movie is going to get better. It never got better. What about the 3D. Even 3D can normally make a movie worth it. I wish I had saved the $26. Yes, I bought the 3D Combo at Amazon. If I could return it, I would. I love action and superhero movies in 3D. I even love the Final Destination series because of the 3D and I don't seem to mind the acting or the fact that I always know how it will turn out. This movie was a bit different. Since I got the 3D TV there is very little content. I have been collecting movies. After purchasing a few movies that I did not like (Sanctum and The Nightmare Before Christmas), I thought that maybe I should stick to action films. I really liked Drive Angry, Thor, and Green Lantern. This one was was not all that good (acting, action, and 3D). I would rent it if I could on Vudu."
2,The Worst Avengers Movie Yet,"I've been amped for Marvel's tie-ins to The Avengers next year, but this one is a real stinker. Yeah Iron Man 2 wasn't the deepest movie, but the plot here is completely superfluous. They spend waay too much time showing what a wimp Steve Rogers is, then basically throw him into WWII with almost no exposition or real plot. Somehow the Red Skull has gotten a hold of the Cosmic Cube, but with no idea what to do with it, and Cap has even less idea what's going on. It's like a condensed version of what the movie should have been, but with just a beginning, and an end. The pay-off for the epilogue is almost it's only saving grace, which is basically another trailer for Avengers, then an actual teaser trailer for Avengers. Enough hype already, just bring on the main event."
2,Weak plot spoils a great movie,Aside from a perfect choice in a lead character Captain America falls very short of what are usually entertaining and enjoyable movies. This movie takes itself far to seriously and doesn't bother to provide any introduction to the characters and what role they play in the film. Hugo Weaving is exceptional as Red Skull but again he is underutilized.The movie spends far too much time to get going and when it does the action is disjointed and the characters are poorly developed and less than interesting. While I am sure the casting of Captain America was a good choice everything about the movie itself was weak. This is not must see TV.
2,"OMG, this is a slow starter...zzz...zzz","I like all kinds of movies...action, drama, comedy, romance, documentary, etc. I have an attention spam beyond that of many. But when I watch an action film I want action and it took 90 minutes to get there on a thin plot line. Painful. ."
2,Captain America: The Story of Underwhelming Theatrical Outcomes,"There was nothing but excitement as I waited in the midnight showing line for Captain America. It didn't matter if I had business in the morning (this movie would rock!). Unfortunately, that was not the case. In the end, I found myself trying to convince myself I didn't waste my time or money.In my opinion, the movie failed to capitalize on the great cast and instead went for a very safe route or what the movie executives perceived as 'safe'. The dialogue was quite boring and there was not enough time devoted to developing the characters. In the end it felt rushed and underdeveloped. There were little character I could relate to and Tommy Lee Jone was pretty much had the only memorable moments. There is no replay value. Very sad. I really wanted to like this movie. I could give a second movie a try but I will wait to after I read reviews this time. The Avengers movie doesn't have me too excited but hopefully it will rock."
3,Just OK,I was excited to get this DVD and was disapointed in the end. Chris Evans is hot as is Richard Armitage but they dont let them do what they do best. I think this movie needed a better director because he directed this one in to boredom.
4,Great movie,This is exactly as expected. A fun movie that will entertain and make you proud to be an American. It's not a classic or award worthy. It's just entertaining.
5,Great Movie,"I bought this movie to watch on the boat will fishing, and it turned out to be really good. really enjoyed it."
4,A pleasant surprise!,"I was definitely skeptical when I heard of Chris Evans' casting for this role but he more than made up for it. I'm not a big Marvel fan ... or Captain America fan, for that matter. I consider him to be just a big propaganda creation for the U.S. military. And while he is just that, this was still a really well-done film. It was not as good asX-Men: First Classbut it is right up there withIron Man (Single-Disc Edition)."
3,Captain America... Not as cool as I remembered.,"So in short the movie was OKAY. It had plenty of good characters involved and the story told was decent. However the movie lacked a lot of action to really show what Captain America could do. Not to mention the way the movie was presented was an extremely bad idea. It was rushed and a lot of the movie is summary scenes (one scene flashing over multiple instances with music attempting to tell a story in 1.5 seconds so we can rush to the end). Captain America needed more time to develope and better action scenes to show off his abilities. I walked away thinking, ""What is Captain America going to do in the Avengers? Hand out towels and water for the real superheroes?"". The movie was entertaining, but lacked the enjoyment and fun that other superhero flicks have captured."
2,HMMMMM.....,"I know that this is America...but i obviously just dont like the spokes person to represent it. I did not like this movie. And everytime i tell people this they get their panties in a bunch saying how im suppose to like captain america because i live in america. NOT! This movie was as bad as i pictured it. I almost fell asleep. It has its slow moments where you just want to break the TV, then right before you fall asleep the action picks up and your like ""OOOHHH interesting stuff....stay awake.."" I have nothing against captain america, its just in my opinion it could have been WAAAYYY better than it turned out to be."
5,Love it!,Wow all these Avenger movies are very good and well done i can't wait for the sequel and the Iron Man sequel.
4,Great movie but...,"Ok my dissappointment is you buy a used dvd/blu-ray only 1 disc shows up. Buyers beware on used dvds/bluray combos. Anyways the blu-ray is awsome, wanting the dvd to rip it to mp4 video using 123copydvd software..."
5,Arrived quickly with DVD slightly scratched,"I watched the dvd to see if there was skipping, but it ran clean, so all is good. This was a good story, but not as re-watchable as iron man or avengers."
3,Decent Cap story.,They got the origin down pat and the right choice in actor to portray captain america but the film drags in the middle luckily it picks back up in the end to finish well.
3,American hero? No. American zero!,"This movie in my opinion lacks all the things that a good movie would have in it. First ,a great story line,secondly,seat gluing action.And last it lacks 2 stars from being a movie that I love."
4,DVD,Fun to watch...dosen't pretend to be more than an action movie filled with colorful characters with inhuman prowess...making us all wish there was such a person in real life.
5,Love it.,If you love marvel movies then you need to add this one to your collection. It was a great movie.
4,"Great movie .... However, have a bone to pick with casting!","Great effects ... Especially, the Blu-ray version! However, I wanna dope-slap the bonehead who cast Tommy Lee Jones as an active WWII Army Colonel. Don't get me wrong ... I have no gripes with Tommy Lee as an actor. As a fellow South-Central Texan, Tommy Lee is absolutely A-OK in my book!However, in this movie, he looks as if he's 80+ years old! He don't look like no active Colonel I've ever served with! The bags under the eyes and the wrinkles made him look as if he should have been wearing a VFW Legion Post cap, instead of the cap of an active duty Army Colonel. You would think that, at least the folks in the Makeup Department could have tried to make him look at least 10 years younger!All-in-all, though ... Another great MARVEL Comics movie for my collection!"
5,worth it,"this is worth wating a few days and saving money, bought it here and saved a few dollars then going to bestbuy and over paying and this blu ray is extactly the same as bestbuy and it shipped fist class mail it came a day sooner then what was said plus it came before new years"
3,It's ok but...,"Not much 3d in this one. The movie itself is ok but I was more interested in seeing it in 3d. The effect is light and nothing ""jumps"" out at you. I'm fact you could almost watch this movie without glasses that's how little 3d is actually there.I added it to my collection but if I had know before purchasing that the 3d effect was really lite I improbably wouldn't have purchased it I could have just bought the bluray version."
5,Awesome super hero movie!,This installment of the Avengers series is exciting with an enjoyable plot. I highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 13 looking for a great super hero movie.
4,Enjoyable,"My kids enjoyed this movie and were glad to add it to our collection. I found it a little slow at times, but overall a good family movie."
5,WHY is there NO OPTION to NOT RESPOND?,WHY is there NO OPTION to NOT RESPOND?WHY is there NO OPTION to NOT RESPOND?WHY is there NO OPTION to NOT RESPOND?
4,Average action movie,It was an average movie. The plot was predictable and the action was weak. It was probably the weakest of the Avenger movies.
5,Chris Evans at his best,"Though the middle of the story is slow, developing the ""character"" of the Captain America suit, the rest of the story has suspense, action and heart. I was surprised how watching this movie opened up the discussion in our family about what WWII was actually like, comparing the artistic license taken in the movie with many truths/experiences of the time. It's amazing what they were able to do via cinema magic to transform this hulky actor - so believable - and Chris Evans nails the role."
5,Great Movie,"Great Movie just don't get tired of it love it in 3D has everything, happy,sad romantic and lots of action just about a good ole american hero"
4,Fun to watch,Good entertainment. Moves along at a good pace. I'm glad I watched it and got caught up with the storyline. Now I have to watch the other movies in this series.
4,All-American action movie,"Starts off a little slow, but really picks up the pace after the first 20 minutes. Great WWII action movie. Almost like Star Wars meets GI Joe. Good adaptation from the comic book."
3,Typical superhero movie,"No suprises in this latest Avengers installment. I good superhero movie, but not anything special. You have seen the freindship plot line many times and the romance plot line seems contrived and not believable."
3,I would have given it 3.5 if I could,"I enjoyed this movie, especially the story involving Stark Sr. and the old style tributes to the era.Didn't like it as much as Thor, but almost."
3,captain america dvd,"It got here in great time but when I opened the dvd it was all sticky. Idk what it was, but its all good. After cleaning the disc it plays just fine."
4,great movie based upon Jack Kirby and Joe Simon character,Marvel maniacs and Kirby fans should be happy with this movie. Blu Ray is great. Bonus materials are always welcomed.
5,BUY IT!,"I've seen this movie in both 2D and in 3D, and let me tell you something.... I think that EVERYONE should experience this movie in 3D."
5,DVD,Loved this movie!!! The stars were great especially Stanley Tucci. A movie for family enjoyment. Captain America was a real hero.
4,A good superhero movie,"I think the best thing about Captain America was Captain America himself -- a nerd turned into a hero in a matter of minutes. I liked his character, since he never lost his ""aw, shucks"" country boy goodness. The rest of the story, well, it's pretty standard stuff - Indiana Jones probably did Nazis better. But all in all, an enjoyable movie, nice for a rainy afternoon."
5,A feel good movie,"This has got to be one of the best movies Marvel has put out. It's a classic good vs evil movie crossed with the story of the underdog rising to the challenge. Good morales for all ages (really small children might have nightmares about the crazy red-faced guy). Only complaint was that I couldn't find a way to stream it on any service (amazon, vudu, etc). Had to goto a Redbox to rent it in blu-ray (which was waaay cheaper anyway). The production companies really need to get their act together with the streaming. Other than that, AWESOME MOVIE!!"
4,Review of Captain America: The First Avenger,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. The story line and characters were engaging, overall it was much more exciting than we anticipated. I definitely recommend."
2,Plain vanilla treatment of an American hero,"This was a supreme letdown. I was expecting something that was as cool, smart, and brave as the comic book. What I got was a bland rehashing of some hero-like story that was too focused on being politically correct rather than true to the comic book. This simply made it annoying and boring, rather than aspiring or relevant to today's kid. All in all, this was a fatal flaw with the movie. The acting was good, but this made the movie almost unwatchable. Get it, but be ready for politically correct hero-like antics. :("
3,inaccurate,"It's fine this is a fiction ww2 movie, but at least make it accurate, there were no Blacks and whites working together in the US army or military at the time. I'm so tired of Hollywood throwing this diversity nonsense at me!"
1,Cheesy and Boring,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever forced myself to sit through. While the ""diesel punk"" styling was quite fun, the plot and acting were terrible. Boring, Boring, Boring. Long dull scenes interspersed with mediocre action and some of the cheesiest dialogue I've heard in ages. Save yourself a few bucks and just watch the trailers. As a long time Capt. fan since the 60's I was severely disappointed."
1,Almost nothing about this film was appealing....,"Whole film was dark, CGI wasn't believable, was a completely unbelievable rendition of what WWII was like with a whole lot of stupid. Yeah, I get the whole 'the bad guys have super technology' crap, but reel it in a little, and I know it is a comic book character, but make it remotely believable or make me care the tiniest bit."
1,How can anyone like this movie?,This movie was bad. It is almost as if the dialogue and the plot were written around the action scenes. The acting wasn't convincing. I didn't care about the main Character or his journey. I was completely indifferent toward the outcome of the movie. This would have acceptable as a cartoon that was released straight to DVD. The amount of good reviews should really be an indicator of the society we are crafting.
1,Didn't play,"I received this item, and when we finally got around to trying to watch it, it didn't work. It won't play on any player I have in my home."
1,boring,I slept through the last half hour of the movie. It was so bad that I let the rent time expired instead of wasting time to keep watching it.
5,As expected,"Arrived new and in box as advertised and within the time frame. It may have even come a little early. No scratches, plays just fine, everything you would expect when buying a DVD, so it's good."
3,No wonder the price dropped,"The movie on Blue-ray was good, but the regular dvd/digital copy sucked. Could not copy the digital copy to pc - would not read the dvd version so don't waste your money on it. Just get the BR version."
2,Rushed,"All though the movie I felt rushed, like the film makers were trying to get me out the door.The scenes are predictable and forced in order to cram character development into 5 minutes. Even the action scenes were compiled into a simple montage that shown as a film within the movie.The CG was also very poor. I guess they wanted to use the same cg from the film in the video games.As a review for the amazon video service. It's very nice, but I would like to see more functions implemented like subtitles, settings management, and the ability to play HD movies on my computer not just on my tv."
2,This is kid's stuff!!,"The action is for kids 10 and under!!!It got pretty boring half-way. It's just a waste of my money that could have spend in some more entertaining way. But if you are a kid, you will love this movie!"
4,very enjoyable and good action,GOOD PLOT AND ACTION i WAS STUCK TO THE SCREEN AND UNABLE TO LEAVE UNTIL THE MOVIE WAS COMPLETE I COULDNDET MOVE TO GET POP CORN OR A DRINK
3,Predictable & Great to Watch,"Fabulous fun to watch! Clean language. No nudity. Historical inaccuracy is totally unacceptable: The Flying Wing should have been credited to Jack Northrop, NOT Nazi Germany."
4,Great clean action movie,"I'm a long time fan of Captain America in the comic books, so I was almost certainly going to be a fan. This is way better than a comic book. I loved the main storyline.It was a little weird that all but 5 or 10 minutes of the movie was one long flashback. I don't want to give away anything - but they could of skipped all the present-day stuff - and ended the film with the first scene - and I'd have been happier. The very last scene left me with a sad feeling, though most of the movie was very uplifting."
4,Action packed,This was an entertaining film - not an instant classic but well-worth the watch. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys this genre or action movies.
4,Great Superhero Movie,"I saw it when it came out in theaters on opening night back in July. I thought was great and awesome.If you want to see a good superhero movie this the one for you or just a great action movie, this movie is great for you as well. It's close to the original comic book. If you're a fan of comics and movies. Give it a watch."
5,Best for Native Speakers,"I just finished a class on English Structure using this as our textbook. The authors bring you through reasoning about grammar principles/rules/nuances via examples and short exercises. I found it to be an extremely useful review of basic to advanced grammar points, with helpful hints on activities and common gotchas for ESL/EFL students. I give this 5 stars for the native english speaking teacher (However, I would give 4 stars as a resource for teachers who have english as a second language themselves, as much of the book's exercises assume you inductively learned many of the rules, and I could see this being lost on the non native speaker. However, they do explain the subtle nuances in most cases, so it is still a good guide)."
5,Sounds a bit more like punk than metal... for now,"Iron Maiden's first two albums, with singer Paul Di'anno, sound a tad more like fast punk music than the signature ""Maiden Metal"" sound. These definitely are outcasts in the way the band progressed, but does this make them bad? NO! Iron Maiden has some excellent songs on it, such as ""Phantom of the Opera"" (my favorite,) ""Running Free,"" and the headbanging title track ""Iron Maiden."" If you're new to Maiden, start with Piece of Mind or Number of the Beast, and then get this, because it alone is a classic!"
5,Absolute perfection,"First an (easy) observation: Mark Blake needs therapy, or he simply doesn't have a clue about heavy metal. Now about the title: This is probably the best Maiden CD. ALL the songs are of a high quality. In fact this is the only Maiden CD I don't skip any song. Paul Di Anno's voice fits excellently to these songs (I disagree Bruce Dickinson can perform them better!). Clive Burr is also considered better than Nicko McBrain and Dennis Stratton makes a fantastic couple with Dave Murray (although Dave found the perfect match with Adrian Smith). I like each and everyone of the songs but especially Phantom of the Opera is a metal masterpiece."
4,Spectacular!!!,"This album is very very cool! The best Iron Maiden song ever is on this album, Phantom Of The Opera!This album also has the song Iron Maiden... it started it all! This album rules, buy it...now!"
5,Pretty damn good for a debut,"Ok, this album is a well done album. But I can't really judge this album to harshly because before I heard this album I had owned all of Bruce's stuff with maiden. And once you've had Bruce... you can never go back. But I tried to go back with killers and Iron Maiden. This album is decent. The highlight to me would be Running free, and Transylvania is one of my all time favorite instralmentals(nothing tops the call of Kutulu-Metallica), anyway this album is pretty good, worth buyin ir your a maiden fan, which I am. So have fun with it and as always. Up the Irons!"
2,Kind of boring and lacks punch.,I'm not real crazy about Iron Maiden's first album. It's preety mediocre compared to next few albums. The better stuff is what follows this.
3,more punk than metal,"ok..i know one of the best metal bands ever, but i hate metal.in the words of jello biafra""The music's OK when there's more ideas than solos"".This is a pretty good cd prowler definitly being the best song on the disk by far.i bought this cuz i heared it was raw and its not terriable, go listen to some dead kennedys, bad religion or anti-flag though loud,fast, and not a lot of solos."
4,Classic album with some flaws,"The first Iron Maiden album may be considered one of their best if it wasn't for the bad sound and Paul Di'Anno's average vocals. However, his vocals on slower songs are actually quite good like ""Remember Tomorrow"" and one of my favorites that is so underrated - ""Strange World"". I love that song. Most of the songs are classics, and were done a great deal of justice once Bruce did the vocals (with the exception of the aforementioned and ""Prowler"" which Bruce can't sing well). ""Phantom of the Opera"" sounds amazing on ""Live After Death"" and the song ""Iron Maiden"" they still play at every show to this day. The album has so many of their future hits that it watered down ""Killers"". The weak spot is ""Charlotte the Harlot"" - I really don't care for all three of the ""Charlotte"" songs. A classic album, but most songs sound better with Bruce's vocals in later live versions."
3,Maiden meets Punk,"This album is more raw and rough than the more polished albums that followed with Bruce Dickenson.It's amazing how the chemistry of a band can change with a lineup change.The album rocks, but unlike the Bruce years, I can't keep it on a loop and listen to it over and over.Doesn't get nearly enough attention, but well worth a listen."
5,Iron Maiden,Fantastic Iron Maiden album and a great addition to my collection of picture disks. Looking forward to the others when released.
5,ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREAT's!!!!!!!!!!!!,1980..NEARLY 26 year's ago!!!!!WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW??What could be said how ever..is this is UNDERFUC*KINGRATED!!!Seem's all the ''METAL HEAD's'' love the stupid ''NUMBER OF THE BEAST'' album..which I will trash soon!Paul is a million time's better than ''Bruce'' and it suck's they gave him the boot..but then again maybe it was for the better as ''THE BEAST'' album was total crap!Just from the opening second's of PROWLER..you know this is gonna be one hell of a ride!! the song PROWLER is one of my all fave METAL song's!!PROBALLY MY FAVE ALBUM EVER!!!!! NOTHING CAN TOUCH IT!!!! INFLUENCED AS MANY AS THE SABBATH DEBUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! METAL DONE FUKKING RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!BUY IT OR HEAD TO THE LIME PIT!!!!!! ONLY FOR THE TRUE!!!!!
5,"A Great origin of an album, that made them Legends!!","Dynamite, original Iron Maiden,all 9 tracs wonderfully done, killer lightning speed bass on Sanctuary, Phantom of the Opera, Transylvania, and Iron maiden, wonerful guitarist as well with great drumming, and vox, dont waist ur time get the album now. Up the Irons!!!!"
5,Di'Anno Will Forever Be Maiden's Voice,"As an Iron Maiden fan from the very beginning, I can say Bruce worshippers are clueless. Maiden's first 3 albums (Iron Maiden, Killers, Maiden Japan) are their best, and I couldn't imagine anyone on vocals other than Di'Anno. Number of the Beast was solid, Bruce brought a different (not better) theatrical element, but they were never as good after NOTB.FYI - Paul Di'Anno was not fired because of his singing, he was battling alcohol and drug problems (gee what a unique concept for a rock star)."
4,Great Debut!,"This is a Great debut from one of the Best Metal Acts in the World, It's simply Fun, Energetic, and sometimes Punkiest, i really enjoy the RUNNING FREE ' version here more than the Live after death one(in wich nicko always plays it in a very sloopy way), this was a Different IRON MAIDEN back then , and yes' Dirtier , and Tight sound try KILLERS wich in my opinion is a better album than this one with better direction, that's why i gave this album 4 stars -"
4,BLOCK PUNKIN' BEATS,"Raw,as in REALLY raw!!punky in most places.Di Anno...Transilvania is their greatest instrumental BY FAR..Punk It!"
2,Very Innocent,"A disappointing read for someone who enjoys serious romance. Explicit details on how to catch a fish or build a fire in the wilderness, but the romance consisted of just telling the reader they made love. Appropriate perhaps for teenagers."
4,Wild Romance,"The story is good as well as the plot. I love adventure,it was a little thin on survival tech skills to be believable. You can feel the desperation and the love grow. Overall a very good read."
4,Lesbians Surviving in the Wilderness,"A sweet survivalist lesbian romance. A lovely light read with some deeper ""coming-to-terms-with-gayness"" themes mixed in. Survivalist and airplane lore also adds extra flavor. Quite enjoyable."
2,Too innocent is correct and not a romance,"I agree with the review of too innocent. Didn't really get the connection between characters. Being born & bred Wisconsinite - I really wanted to like the book, however I found it unrealistic, for instance in one paragraph the character is getting a bad gash sewn together, then then next text is that it is healed in a few weeks. Also, the 'wild' area is not that remote maybe 50 yrs ago, or maybe the UP just maybe but not the area she talked about. Theres people there all the time now. Romance it was not. Survivalist but not the raw emotion romance that can come from surviving."
3,"Good, not great, book for the non-Engineer","As someone who works in the financial field that had to get up to speed on fiber optics, I purchased this book, ""Introduction to Fiber Optics"" by Crisp, and ""Fiber Optic Reference Guide"" by Goff. This was definitely the most technically oriented of the three, but it did have good detail for the areas where the other two books weren't thorough enough. This text is definitely more for targeted research as a reference book, and not what you should get if you want to sit down and read up on the subject.There were a lot of areas where the added depth provided by this book were helpful, but it certainly has the feel of a book more oriented towards academia and professional engineers."
2,"good, but some mistakes","it is good to understand overall range of fiber optics, but this book has some fatal errors( for example, Figure7.10 & 2nd paragraph at p135, also things about self-phase modulation of soliton transmission, and several other things at another pages), is vague & feels uncertainty because of skipping necessary details."
3,butterfly mat,"I was pleased with the product, unfortunately I have sent them back due to the fact that the steering wheel cover I purchasd was starting to fall apart after only having it on for a week"
1,not happy,"I purchased this mat & what I don't understand is why a company would sell just one mat at a time.There are TWO sides to a car where people sit so I feel they should have been sold by the pair.Also they were defective on the backside of the ONE mat. The Butterflies were pretty though,but they should have been sold in a pair. Thanks"
5,EXCELLENT FILM! ~~ BUY IT NOW!,"A must see! My husband, 4yr old twin sons, 9 yr old son & myself all watched this movie last night. We all enjoyed it very much & every single one of us cryed. This was the best family movie that we have seen in a l-o-n-g time!"
4,Read the book first!,"This is a great movie, but like most I didn't care for the ending of it. After seeing the movie, I read the book which the movie was based on. The movie takes a few liberty's, increases the importance of the other characters and some of the story line. In the movie, at the end, they show Willie getting on a bus heading for England. Skip is sitting next to Willie's parents. He gives his mom a hug and just gets on the bus, he doesn't pick-up Skip or doesn't say anything to him. There is no way that would have happened in real life. Willie knew he would never see him again. I read the book basicly to see how it ended, and it wasn't like the movie. I am not sure why they didn't use the books ending. I am only giving it 4 stars because of the ending."
5,A Wonderful Find!,"There are so few movies produced these days that the entire family can sit down and enjoy. My Dog Skip is one of those rare movies that can appeal to children and adults alike. Growing up with a dog, I was touched by the bond between the boy and his Jack Russell terrier - it brought back alot of memories. My children were crying at the end of the movie (as were the adults) even though they've never had a dog in the house. The movie is much more than a 'boy and his dog' movie - its about love, loyalty and trust. Again, a great family movie."
1,POOR QUALITY CONTROL...,"THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT A DVD HAS BEEN PURCHASED FROM MOVIE MARS. AND THEY HAVE SENT OUTA DVD THAT IS FOR ANOTHER COUNTRY... AS IT COMES UP AND SAYS WRONG REGION... YOU WOULD THINKTHAT IF THEY ARE SENDING A MOVIE TO SOMEONE IN THE USA THEY WOULD NOT SEND ONE FOR CHINA,INDIA OR WHERE EVER.I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER THING FROM MOVIE MARS..."
2,My Dog Skip,"This was a used video and it was said to be in good shape, but when I was watching it, it started to skip over the words right before the end of the movie the best part. I was disappointed."
2,(Yawn),"The only question this little, kinda likeable movie really poses is, uhh, why? It does evoke a certain nostalgia for WW II era Mississippi (again, why?) But poses no questions and provides no answers. It just sorta ambles along genially, and just sorta ends. Fortunately, it does manage to avoid ""cutesy"" (no mean feat for a picaresque tale about an adorable boy and an adorable doggy). But it's all kinda pointless. Pass the bourbon."
1,"WHO IS RATING THIS 5 Stars?? ""SKIP"" this movie",Very strange storyline and abrupt pointless ending..AVOID this if you have dog loving kids aged 10 or less.
4,My dog Skip,My dog Skip is a great movie the whole family can enjoy. It is a wonderful movie for all ages. I recommend this movie strongly.
3,SKIP IS CUTE,I THOUGHT THIS WAS VERY GOOD.I LOVE DOG MOVIES.I THAT THAT EVEN PEOPLE WHO DONT LOVE DOG MOVIES WILL LIKE THIS. THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE I JUST WANTED TO PICK SKIP UP A CUDDLE HIM.
1,DVD defective,The dvd gave and error and we could not get it to work. The error was something like : cannot use in this area?
4,Very Boring,I found this movie on my shelf and I watched it; And same in 2000 VERY BORING! It's about A boy (Frankie Muniz) And his dog skip and they place a bet and the dog almost got killed by a shovel; That was too violent. And on the scale of 1 to 5 I would give it 4 stars anyway.
3,A very touching story!,"This picture was good, and I liked most of it, but there were some quirks with the picture. For instance:- You wouldn't want to recommend this to children under 7, because when these boys take Willy to that cemetery and told him about the myth of the old witch who was buried there, and the illegal boozers hiding illegal alcohol inside an empty tomb. That just wasn't needed. I was rather displeased. The last few minutes were pretty touching. I almost cried! I never expected this movie to be what I thought it was going to be."
2,Parade of cliches,"I was prepared to like this movie more than I did. I love animals and, well, with ""Skip"" in the title, I expected a lot of cute animal stuff. Well, it was there, but it wasn't nearly enough. Roger Ebert raved about this movie; it's obvious now that his love for his childhood pet grossly clouded his usual Pulitzer prize-winning judgment. This movie is a compendium of tired cliches. The voice-over narration is truly laughable. I suppose the ""messages"" are ""meaningful"" if you've never seen any other movies. But if you have, you'll cringe at the ham-handed efforts of this movie to be ""deep."" This is a movie with a well-intended heart, a heck of a dog as the lead pet, but short of execution. Don't buy this DVD - rent it (at most)."
5,Anyone who likes animals should SEE this!,"Wow, Was very impressed with this movie, amazing Cast and fantastic story. I love my dogs and this movie just brought that home for me. Well told, well acted story. A must see for animal lovers, or anyone. Buy this movie and enjoy!"
5,Tear Jerker :(,Hubby had this movie on on one of the movie channels on TV. We didn't see the beginning but did see the end. Might I say I cried like a baby! We purchased it & shared it with other family members who also loved it. Very good family movie.
3,My Dog Skip,"The movie is really great. It's in the era of The Christmas Story. As for this purchase experience, I was disappointed when I found out what was meant as 'Keepsake Packaging'. It means a plain 2 piece brittle plastic CD case containing a DVD that has no label on it. Bummer, but I will enjoy the movie anyway."
4,Possibly not suitable for dog lovers,"I got this movie because I wanted to laugh and feel good; which I did. But I wish there was a warning on the front that the content of this movie may not be suitable for dog lovers; I cried and cried ...It's a good movie, but it was just too sad for me. I should have seen it coming."
5,Loved It!,"I thought I knew what to expect but there were some lovely unexpected moments.The ending was foreordained, of course, but it completed the story."
1,Horrible shipping time,"As a student chemical engineer I found the book somewhat helpful, but not really. My teacher taught the same material but in a different way and his way seemed much simpler than the books. I returned the book at the end of the semester because none of my classes 'needed' the book. Surprise! I now need the book and amazon apparently takes 1 to 3 months to ship this book...aka I'll get the book at the end of the semester."
2,For Better or Worse...,"I have had Dr. Thomson as an instructor and have used his book for three separate classes. I find the book difficult to follow at times. The end of chapter problems are confusing and seldom can be completed by following the material covered in the text. The book, which is not on its first edition, is filled with ""minor errors"" (for example, constants and/or exponents in presented equations are incorrect). On the plus side, the unit conversions in the appendices are very useful."
3,Sunrise on sunny psychedelic day,"Before U2, and Thin Lizzy there was the Eire Apparent from Ireland they got started by touring with the famous Monkeess Jimi Hendrix Tour. Jimi took them under his wing and produced their album and sings background in the song Mr. Guy Fawkes. they had help from Soft Machine drummer and singer Robert Wyatt and Noel Redding bass player for The Exprience. Wow what a group of mixed style but the album is mostly pop but awesome psychedelic. The influence of Jimi is apparent in some guitar playing their alot of acoutic guitar in the background. Stand out track are Mr. Guy Fawkes , Got to get away, Morning Glory, Captive in the sun, 1026(very nice) the singer has a very orig. voice.Get it before it's out of print remeber it's oneway records.If you dig this then check out EyeQradio.com and listen to The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test on Thrus midnight 2 2am est time hosted by me Corneluis Capote"
3,Hendrix plays on over half of album!!,"Jimi produced thgis LP in 10/68 *and* added guitar to Captive in the Sun, Morning Glory, The Clown, Let Me Stay, Mr. Guy Fawks, Magic Carpet, Someone is Sure to Want You, and Yes I Need Someone.Chris"
2,Helpful for an absolute beginner,"This book has a lot of good information that will probably be helpful in learning Korean, but if you are looking for in depth explanations of grammar systematically, this is not the book for you. I suggest you find a book used in a classroom. The author gives lots of insight into the culture and history of the language and points out a few of the barriers that he had to overcome, but all in all, this book did not help me actually work with the language. He explains the problems that you will have, but he does not actually introduce the grammatical conundrums that bring about those problems. If you have a grammar book to go along this one, that might be a winning couple, but I do want people to know the limitations of this book. It is not a systematic and comprehensive Korean Grammar. You'll have to find that somewhere else."
2,For nostalgia's sake,"This movie isn't the best, nor is it supposed to be. It was created in the hey-dey of Girl Power mania for tweens who loved the Spice Girls; therefore, the simple humor and outrageous plot are aimed directly at such fans. The main appeal of the movie is to see the girls perform some of their greatest hits."
5,I think Spice Girls are great,Ithink Spice Girls are great and have a great personality.I'm their biggest fan.I just looove the Spice Girls.Spice Girls are th best and will always be the best. My name is Nicole Lynn Garza.
3,"THE SPICE GIRLS ARE GOOD SINGERS,BUT ACTRESSES THEIR NOT!!!!",THE ONLY REASON I SAW THIS MOVIE WAS BECAUSE THE SPICE GIRLS WERE IN IT. BUT THEY ARE NO ACTRESSES!!!!!!!! During the whole movie all they did was prance around LIKE their so cool and their songs are like so babish!!! THE ONLY REASON I EVER LIKED THE SPICE GIRLS IS BECAUSE THEY REPRESENTED GIRL POWER! BUT THEY ARE NOT MOVIE STARS THEY ARE SINGERS AND THATS WHAT THEY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT!
2,Spice World,I thought this move was not that great. I think that they give a not so good influence to kids. Look at what they wear. It's horrible. I don't think any kid should want to grow up to be like that.
3,A bit too spicy for me!,"While parts of this film were mildly entertaining, I was surprised by the amount of nudity in the film. I just didn't expect it. This is the first film I've seen since _On Golden Pond_ and I guess I'm just not used to what films are like nowadays.Not a film for those under 18 years of age."
5,Spice World,I think this is a good CD if you like a little latin a little rock n' roll and some of everything!Stop has the sound of the Supremes and Spice up your life is a bit of everything!If you like to try somthing new then Spice world is perfect for you!You should at least try it! Girl Power!
2,Not a good plot,"This movie sucked, and so did that person who wrote a review and said,""some people just don't like a movie that shows gerry almost un-clothed""."
4,The return of the band you love to hate,"Girl power has arrived and it looks like it's here to stay. The second release from the famous british quintent (now a cuartet) has them evolving a fresh new sound and improved singing without actually stearing away from the formula that made them famous; Happy Pop and sweets lyrics with a bit more edge than the previous cd make up SpiceWorld. So if you aren't a big fan of the Spice Girls, get ready cause you will be."
4,BETTER THAN THE FIRST TIME AROUND,"This CD is pretty good for a band that was just put together by a manager who wanted to score a few bucks but, they kicked him out.(Thank goodness)Their first CD had at least 4 OK songs on it. This one has 9 great songs on it out of 11.(The last one had 12 songs on it.)They have good beats you can dance and sing to. The best singer is Mel C. or ""Sporty Spice."" She has a sweet, controled voice which is what makes this CD sound great. I gave it 4 stars cause a couple of the songs aren't up to most people's standards. The songs I'm talking about are ""Denying"" and ""Never Give Up On The Good Times."" The have no beats to it."
2,The Spice Girls are like all Teen Idols,"Does anyone think about David Cassidy? Maybe the young listeners don't know who he is. He was the biggest thing in the 70's, the ultimate teen idol. Now he does a show in Las Vegas. I don't think there is anything wrong with girls liking this music, but most people reviewing this are very young and they don't understand that the music they like now, is not going to last very long.I remember when I was 11 and there was a guy called ""MCHammer"" have you heard of him? He was as big as the Spice Girls, he also did a Pepsi commercial and then he was gone. Now he is bankrupt and everyone hates him. There is a growing backlash to the Spice Girls, and it will only get bigger, it just will. Were the Spice Girls even nominated for an MTV Award this year? One is gone, two are pregnant, soon it won't be ""Girl Power!"" they preach, it will be ""Middle Aged Women Power!"""
2,And I thought they were good.,"After their first CD I figured they would be the best group in the world, but after this CD. My likeness for the Spice Girls drop to a total zero. Definitely a no buy."
2,It was terrible!!,I frankly don't think they have it anymore.. They did before a little bit. I was never a big fan but now I am not one at all.
5,an awesome movie,I think that Spice World was one of the best movies ever made. The Spice Girls are very good singers and good actors also as you can see in this movie. I love the Spice Girls. Victoria you are 'rockin to the moon'!!!!
3,Cant they make a cd with more than 10 tracks at least?,For the music part the only good song is Spice up your life.The rest are out of touch and out of sight. They are to lazy to make a full album of at least 14 tracks or more this sucks.
3,ok kinda goofy but no hard day's night,this was allright it kinday kept me entertained while I had tow watch it w/ a true fan but this has been compared to hard day's night and that's not even close compared to that it is nothing only for diehard fans and if ur in the mood for a really silly movie or if ur really young
5,Still the Best Pop group you'll find.,"In a form of music such as Pop, where most bands are manufactured and work as puppets to the managers and what the record lebel wants them to do, Spice Girls give a strong form of originality that is what makes them stand out among the rest. They write their own music and do their own thing and that works. The second album Spiceworld really shows off their talent. The songs have a great diversity to them and that give them and very diverse fan base and they never make the same song twice like other bands of their nature. This album has a great mix of songs from the great opening track Spice up you Life , to the 40's sound of Too Much and the Lady is a Vamp, to the incredible Ballad, Viva Forever. This is a great album, and I'm sure the next one, Forever, will be just as good. I've already heard the first single, Holler, holler and It's great. All fans of the first album will love Spiceworld. This is one group that holds up through the years."
2,THEY CALL THIS MUSIC!,"THE LAST SPICE GIRLS ALBUM ""SPICE"" WAS GOOD,NOW ""SPICEWORLD"" IS FREAKY.THE MOST FREAKIST SONG I EVER HEARD WAS ""THE LADY IS A VAMP"".""SPICE UP YOUR LIFE"",""DO IT"" AND ""MOVE OVER"" IS VERY ODD AND THEY CALL THIS MUSIC.I GIVE 2 POINTS TO ""TOO MUCH"" CUZ IT'S A NICE SONG,BUT EVERY THING ELSE IS...FREAKY."
4,"No Plot, But Funny","Title says it all. I though the ""plot"" was kinda lame, I found the movie funny. Lately, my inner ""90's child"" was kicking in so I decided to buy this movie. It was fun being a little kid again. ...But here's something I'm beginning to wonder, how on Earth did this movie get a PG rating?! It feature guys in thongs, sexual innuendo, and a lot of other things. Other than that, I reccomend this movie if your a Spice Girls fan or to relive your 90's days."
3,"If you're a true fan, you'd like it","Who cares if the plot made no sense, who cares if they couldn't act, what did you expect? These are the Spice Girls! No one ever nominated them for a Grammy, so why should you critize them for not trying to use millions of dollars to get an Oscar nomination? It's sorta sick to see so many movies try to break box office records and get Oscar noms. They just wanted to make a movie in which you could just sit back and laugh. They didn't expect to last forever as a band, or actresses. So get over it! I got this movie over a year ago and I still watch it from time to time. It's just a time capsule of how earth was durin the brief moment it was known as Spice World. It would've been worse if these girls actually took themselves seriously and tried to go off and act in 'real movies'. If you're a true fan of these girls, you'll watch it."
1,"Tried to return, No answer yet",I tried to return this item and have to obtain permission from the overseas supplier. So far it has been over a week and no response. I thought my daughter would enjoy this movie put she showed no interest and asked me to return it.
1,This album is pure garbage.,Anyone can see that this album is full of s**t. Don't waste your money on this CD. These girls can't sing or dance. Thank goodness for rap. Long live DMX and Snoop!!!!!!!
1,Hopeless,"God! What was I thinking when I decidedto watch this movie. Oh yeah! I was a big fan of Spice Girls and I wasn't really thinking.Seriously, I expected more than this. I Thought they could have done better...MUCH BETTER! Before this movie came out, I thought it owuld be brilliant but, I am so god damn disappointed! This came out more of a stereotype of the worse movie ever. The word WHYYYYYYYY comes to mind.They have the potential to be great actress and they have blew it here! They should have gotten a better script."
1,The Spice Girls Can Do Magic Tricks?,"I guess they can! They manage to turn five women who can't sing into five women who can't act! This movie wouldn't have been so horrible if it hadn't been predictable. The "" girls "" were too busy acting out their personas and trying to be bubbly and funny that any spark was lost at the end. Unless you're a hang on Spice Girl fan---and not embarrassed to admit it, you will PROBABLY like this. Then again a SG fan has already seen this movie, whatever it is. But it does prove I'm pyschic. I knew they would break up after this film and...they did. Why buy this when you can rent something more challenging to the mind like Big Bird's Big Adventure."
1,Boring.,Spice world is nothing but a waste of time. I will not reccomendit. So go out and do somethingwith your time. Don't watch thissuper-stupid movie!
2,below average,This dvd was below average and we could not even watch the whole thing. It seems totally dated now.
3,lacking in talent - but a whole lotta fun,"Between sexual attraction and funky-over-processed-fan-oriented-lyrics, these girls have pulled through. For whatever reason, they have somehow (a publicity miracle if you ask me) managed to make it. But what's the use in hating them? Go ahead....be trendy, be superficial, be a whole lotta skin...As long as the rest of the world is going for it, why not hop on for the ride? If nothing else, laugh at them - at least you're smiling!"
5,I've seen it 15 times for a reason!!,"A great, hilarious, quotable movie!!!I saw it with a friend, first thinking oh no, stupid spice girls, but I watched the whole movie, and now I'm a TOTAL SPICER! Of course it's cheesy and not at all serious, but for its sort of movie, it's PERFECT! Go and see it, many times, it is a wonderful celebration of British culture! Viva Forever SPICE GIRLS!!"
4,it's a great movie!,"this movie is really cool the 1st 4 or 5 times but after that it gets dull.when i 1st saw it it was amazing and i still do like it but soon it would get sort of boring.just try and buy it. at 1st it will seem great but after the 1st couple of times you will see what i mean.if you are interested in the spice girls and want information on joining my spice girl fan/pen pal club you are more than welcome to e-mail me and give me your e-mail address.i have pen pals from all over the world!england,south carolina,texes,mexico,and florida.anywhere!i am ten years old and i like posh spice and scary spice."
5,Good Clean Fun,"I love this movie, I'm 23 and was a teen when these girls hit the airwaves, I love them, I love the movie, it's great for teen girls I think (be careful just a little adult humor), buy it!"
3,Surprisingly good -- except for the music,"Starring the British girl-power band formerly known as the Spice Girls, Spice World is better than anyone has any right to expect. Even the most hardened Spice-hater (of which I am definitely one) should find something to like.The tongue-in-cheek approach taken by Spice World is what makes the movie work. The Spice Girls, while not Oscar-caliber actresses, do manage to pull off their roles with relative panache. (It helps that they're playing themselves.)However, there are frequent musical numbers, which (unless you're a fan of the Spice Girls' music) are painful to listen to. Times like this are what the mute button is made for.All in all, an amusing, if forgettable movie."
5,spice girls!,"the spice girls are always awesome, and to get it on DVD is even more awesome when i can watch it as many times as i want."
1,THIS BAD,These girlz have no talent whatsoever (unlike LINKIN PARK). U should not buy this DVD.They r the worst actorz ever 2! I love Legolas by the way!They r the worst singerz ever. U should listen 2 rock music(best music ever). Hey if u wanna im me im me @ ElfGirl6150.
1,Don't waste your cash on this.,"The spice girls can't sing, they don't play any instruments nor do they write their own lyrics. The songs on spiceworld are superficial and - ultimately - annoying. If you actually like this kind of stuff, I'd suggest that you give REM, Nine Inch Nails, or even Sheryl Crow a go - and find out what real music sounds like."
1,The best of the Spice Girls,"This album is by far the best album by this talented group. It starts off with their famous dance song, ""Spise up your Life!"" and the fun keeps going all the way down to the wonderful ""Viva Forever"" . Also, another focal point is ""Too Much"". The girls really blend together well in this album. And Victoria has changed from a background vocalist to a soloist, so you know it has to be fun. So if you are just sitting around and listening to the sample songs, BUY IT!!!! It is a must have."
1,"This Movie really, really, really sucked bad!",IF you like Crap this movie is just the right thing for you! For two hours wasted of your life buy this movie today!
1,huh?????,i thought it was very mature.my cousin watched it with me and i think that it was a movie that should have been rated R...some people just don't like a movie that shows gerry almost un-clothed!i don't think that you should se it if you want to see a good movie!
1,How are you supposed to take this rubbish seriously?,"These kiddies are awful. The first time I ever heard them was on the radio with Wanna or whatever it was called, and I could not believe that anyone could come up with lyrics and music so .... perfect and total in its ability to suck really really heavily. Well let me tell you something right now, girls and boys, this album sucks even more. It sucks so much, actually, I have heard that in one record shop which kept quite a lot of stock of this album, the windows caved in with the colossal suction. 'Nuff said. PS. I would appreciate any comments. Cheers! Ben xxx"
5,Pure Pop Perfection,"I was rummaging through my old CD's today and came across the Spice Girls. I remember 7 years ago when I first heard ""Wannabe"" and I went wild! Awesome song!Anyway, back to the album: Spice World was an AWESOME movie and this soundtrack is an awesome trip down memory lane!"
3,The singers are rockin my world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first song, spice up you life, rocks. But then the farther that you get into the CD, that's when the goodness of the CD begins to deplete. This dosen't mean that the whole CD in the end is bad, because it isn't. If you are looking for a fun CD with not much meaning to it, then this CD isn't bad at all. If you want to go deep, then you should choose a CD with a little more complexity. The best part about it though, is that the people singing really have fun doing what their doing. The spice girl's message is totally, ""GIRL POWER!""The really stand up for gilrs doing things their way, yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good,"Spice Girls are one of those groups that even if you're a hardcore rocker you HAVE to love it. I enjoyed this album very much. It's fun to listen to. Spice Girls never fail to produce wonderful pop/dance music to listen to when you want to just relax in your room or with a couple of friends. A GREAT cd to do karoake to as well. Favourites- 'Denying', 'Viva Forever', 'Too Much' and 'Do It'"
1,"The Spice cabinet's empty and so is the ""acting"" in this mov","The only people who would enjoy this silly senseless flick, are kids who enjoy the Spice Girl's music. For the rest of us, it borders on mindless tedium. The girls had better stick to singing which is also questionable at times. My strong hunch is there won't be a sequel to this flop!"
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,I had to watch this stupid film because my sis likes the spice girls. She hated it. I forced her to apoligize. I regret the fact that I can't give this film a 0 but a 1 will have to do.
2,Looks like a Richard Lester film.,"If you know Lester's work, you know that he makes lousy films that are sometimes funny. This is a lousy film which is sometimes funny. But the girls really have no talent. Victoria Beckham can sort of sing, but that's about it. Not much at all really."
2,"The Spice Girls, the group you love to hate.","As far as teenybopper music goes, this is as good as it gets. That isn't a good thing.I did not buy this album, but I have heard so much of it. They are everywhere! And with Geri flying the coup, they have become even more popular. This is music only a girl aged 5-13 could like. Light, fluffy pop music made by five (well, now it's four) very flashy and very wild women who have dented pop culture with the slogan ""Girl Power"".The music kind of grew on me the more I heard it on the radio and saw their videos on Muchmusic. While there are only two songs I actually like (""Viva Forever"" and ""Goodbye""), there is no denying their staying power. It took me weeks to get the song ""Stop"" out of my head. But to be sure, the music is basically garbage. And hopefully they'll know when to quit.I wouldn't buy this album, nor would I recommend it. But it is good music for kids.By the way, I like Posh Spice the best."
3,This cd shows Spice Girls sing a variety of songs.,This is a great cd of the Spice Girl songs. It can get you moving and can help you slow down. Some songs make a great workout.
4,"Good, not really good, but good",This movie deserves to be watched at least once by everyone. If you want to watch it more after that-fine your choice. I think the Spice Girls had better stick to singing though.
2,"Stinky, yeah, but . . . .","Okay, so Spice Girls kind of stink. The two stars are for Viva Forever and Stop. At least they were decent. Well, think about it. How would you like to go around the world and go up on a stage in front of thousands of millions of people? Nobody's stoppin' you! Be my guest. Still, Spice Girls really stink. There are many things that are much better!"
3,SPICE UP MY LIFE!,"I totally liked the movie and the songs that the Spice Girls did. Some of their songs are relaxing and others make you want to dance! this movie really had all their songs on it and it had some funny moments! Their are some other scenes in the movie with the Spice Girls like meeting aliens, dancing with a soldier director, Spice Girls delivering a baby, riding in a boat with little girls getting them into an accident, and the policeman forgiving them from speeding their spice bus just because they're famous! the movie can be a little overatting because it has a thin plot! But it is a good movie for Spice girl fans like me!Although their singing are a little off sometimes and their acting but I love them and I love their songs. Too bad Spice Girls are not around anymore!"
4,Spice World,"I bought this movie for my 7 year old daughter, and we have fun watching it. It's about 5 girls having fun, and along the way, some difficulties. This movie is not made to make you think about anthing. It's made to make you laugh and sing along with the songs."
3,It wasn't great but it had it's good parts,Spice girls was an okay movie I found myself liking it but not enough to buy it. It could have been better i think they needed a more comedy in it. This is the kind of movie where you really have to be a fan of the spice girls to really like it.
2,THIS MOVIE WOULD MAKE A GOOD MST3K EPISODE,This movie had so many stupid stuff on that it deserves to be on MST3K.I bet Mike and the bots can save this movie from its misery.
3,Not as great,The Spice Girls are truly GIRL POWER but Spiceworld isn't as good as SPICE. Come on people quit saying all pre-teens like cause I don't! Beside thou shalt not idolize anyone else but God.
3,sorta good,"I think the Spice Girls's 15 minutes of fame are up. This CD is okay, but it rates very averagely. And if the Spice Girls are all about Girl Power, why are most of their songs about men? I think that's rather hypocritical. And I'm glad that Geri left, she couldn't sing for her life. And Spice World was maybe the worst movie I have ever seen."
4,Great album! Well done!,"The latest Spice Girls album, spice world, has a good mixture of slow songs, pop, and dance. The Spice Girls have released 4 singles from their album so far. Spice Up Your Life, Too Much, Stop and Viva Forever. The general message being delivered through this album was definitely GIRL POWER, just like the last one. On some songs, the message `be just like a spice girl' is conveyed. The British girl group has done a good job on the vocals. Each voice is individual, but still mixes well with the other ones. The music seems to have Spanish (VIVA Forever) influences as well as soul influences and Elvis influences (The Lady is a Vamp, Too Much). Over all, a good album."
2,OK,"This album is okay, I don't think it's that great, it's got some good songs with a beat, but you get tired of them easily."
3,Ok So I Wanna Be a Spice Girl,"My 10 year old and her friends love these sassy cockney girls; I guess I do too. Why? Because they are fun, silly and their concert rocked! I am a 40 year old mother who occasionally turns this CD on while I clean the house...the beat is great, especially ""Spice Up Your Life."" Okay, so I even learned the choregraphy. YIKES. ""Generation Next"" is pretty good, too. People tell me I look exactly like the now-departed Ginger Spice...so I ask you, since I know the lyrics, and have thighs that jiggle just like theirs, tell me where to sign up!"
2,Lame.,"Spiceworld by Spice Girls is a predictable album and after this album was released I stopped being a fan. The songs are weak and formulatic, this is the final time we hear Geri Halliwell, she left the group a year after the release of this album. Songs like Spice Up Your Life, Too Much, Viva Forever, and Stop have no flavor or edge to them, their debut album was ten times better than Spiceworld. This album is a stinker and even those euro babes knew it too."
2,Cruel Brittania,"Britain, circa 1997. Tony Blair is elected P.M. Princess Di perishes. And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public. This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing. To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is. Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor. The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what ""A Hard Days' Night"" did for the Beatles. Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze. I was reminded more of the Monkees' ""Head"" than I was of ""A Hard Days' Night"". Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught. Oh, well. On to ""From Justin to Kelly""."
2,The best for this group...,"And that's not saying much. These girls are annoying and dead(not literally.) This is nothing but pure bubblegum pop, though not as cheesy as the first record. The only good songs on here are Never GIve Up on the Good Times(should have been a single instead of the awful other three) and Viva Forever. My recommendation? Buy the Viva Forever single-t's their only good song, and the rest of this piece...(except for Never Give Up, download that one) isn't worth it."
1,"Um, this is the WORST movie!!","Hello people?? How could you give this movie more than two stars?? It stunk. The acting was terribly fake and forced, which is sad because they are supposedly playing THEMSELVES. Or at least their FACTORY made selves! This is NOT a peak into their real world, because they weren't actually friends before they were famous, struggling to reach stardom. They all replied to an add in the newspaper for auditions for a group called the Spice Girls. The movie is just another cheap piece of junk that you gals can put on your shelf. Next to your Spice lollipops,lip gloss,books,CD's,earasers,pencils,perfume,dolls,actionfigures,barbies,posters,stickers,tatoos,pictures,magazines and ice cream!! Can you say ""propaganda"" children??"
1,"Spicy, not so satisfying","Ok, we'd all expect this movie to really reall really really really really really ..., but it kinda did. Either way, watch this movie, you'll fall over laughing."
1,TOO MUCH FOR FIVE YEAR OLDS!,"This movie is for 5-7 year olds.I'ts dumb.My friend wanted too see it but I told her no beacuse she might die of bordom.I hate this,it's soooo stupid.My 6 year old cousin saw this even and said it's boring.I hate this movie!"
1,THIS REALLY WAS SO DUMB.............,Im a girl and I hated this.Among the fact that the spice girls think they're soooo cool I would rather watch south park.This movie was really dumb thats all I can say!
2,Spiceworld,While the cd appears to be new. There was no cover jacket in the cd? That is unfortunate as i don't have that information. I am not sure I will order again. That shouldn't have happened.
5,The Best Stupid Movie I've Ever Seen,"This movie is simply hilarious. I was quite captivated by the Spice Girls when this movie first came out. Shortly after, I outgrew them, but I still LOVE this movie. Anyone who has not seen it, needs to. Period."
3,Never Give Up On The Good Times is a great song!,"I'm not a big fan of this album as a whole but I really do feel thatNever Give Up On The Good Times is a great song!!!.. so if you're lookingfor more Spice Girls (especially if you only have Spice), then I wouldgo ahead and get this album.. if nothing else.. atleast for this song!!"
3,"Don't even think about it, Just watch","Spice World is actually a very hilarious film. It makes fun of the Spice Girls and the world they live in. It's also done in the spirit of A Hard Day's Night. Everyone in the film is great, and it's a nice surprise to see some notable Brits like Elton John and Jennifer Saunders in the film. Don't take the movie seriously, it's meant to be fun and silly. Also, this is one of the rare momments you will see Geri Halliwell with the group. It is definately a guilty pleasure, and fun to watch!"
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED!,THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!! THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT IT IS KIDS IN THE HALL VETERN MARK MCKINNEY.
2,um,"I saw this becuase my little brother wanted me to.It tries to make the Spice Girls seem like the coolest and greatest. Kinda patheticAlso, isn't femenism partly about not being treated like an object. Yet Scary who claims to be feminist (as well as the other Spice Girls) says something like ""We think men should be ordered like a pizza"". That's just sexist.So why did I give it 2 stars? Well it has a couple funny bits when the focus is off the Spice Girls. I'd really rather give it 1 and 1/2 or 1 and 1/4 though."
5,I am the walrus?,"Masterful album, released at precisely the right time. Sir John himself couldn't have written this. Where he used sarcasm, the Spice Girls use wit, and it will take them a long way. The depth and innovation are very apparent, and I only hope there is a follow up album."
4,"SPICE WORLD,REALLY?",YES!This movie the girls were playing part of themselve but it quite a bit bored but it's okay.
5,Spiceworld Rules!,"this is the best album i have ever listened to with Spice right behind it.the song are great,their voices are great and if you listen to it you'll forever."
5,The Spice Girls are the best!!!!!!!,"This CD is packed with flavor and girl power. I love this CD! My favorite song on it is ""Spice Up Your Life""."
5,Exciting!!,"This movie speaks about five girls. They aren't only 5 girls:they are the Spice Girls. I think it is an important thingh for a Spice fan. They have to ""make up"" a concert, but someone doesn't want they do it. In this movie you can find a lot of their songs."
2,A movie fans will love... but only the fans.,"Been a fan of the Spice Girls for quite some time now. Love their music, but I can't lie. This movie has one of the worst story lines ever created. I really hate that part when they say they're really hot and need a fan, then a screaming girl comes running in. I mean, come on, that was just too lame. The editor must have been on crack when he let that slip. As much as I hate to do it, I can't go any higher than 2 stars on this one. Sorry girls."
5,A very good movie!,"I am a very big Spice Girls fan and I thought that this was a very good movie. All of the girls are very talented and this movie showed it. The only part in the movie i think should have been left out is when they encountered the aliens, that part was pretty much useless. But other than that, it was a terrific movie."
4,Spice the 2nd,"This album is better than their first one. EVERY song stays in your ear and their are no more wannabe - R n'B songs.Spice up your life: The first single. A great song.Stop: Purest pop. I like it.Too much: You think they can't sing? This song proves you're wrong. They can. (Mel C and Emma very well, the others at least a little bit).Saturday night divas: Not a bad song but not a very good one.Never give up on the good times: You can't get this song out of your ear. It almost starts going on your nerves.Move over: THe pepsi-song is one of the worst songs they ever released but I like it somehow.Do it: This is a great partysong.Denying: This one needed to grow on me. Now I like it. It's a mix of pop and R n'B.Viva forever: I used to love this ballad but it's so overplayd. This is the last single with Geri.The lady is a vamp: Another song about Girlpower. It should sound like something from the fifties I guess but it's not very good."
5,I think it is real wild and that's why I like it!,"I think Spice up Your Life is the best song. And Too Much is my least favorite, but all the others are to hard to pick favorites."
2,I dislike this movie,"I thought it was a very stupid movie. Yess, the music is okay, but with no plot, what is it? In the commercial they had parts which were not in the movie which I don't think is good, because they are telling people that these parts are in the movie when they are really not in the movie."
1,THIS CD STINKS!!!!!,"Don't waste time, money, or even your eye site on this CD. The Spice Girls always stunk and the tradidtion lives in this CD. THE SPICE GIRLS WERE NEVER GOOD AND WILL NEVER MATCH THE OTHER GREAT GROUPS OUT THERE!!!"
1,How to make a bad song!!,"First put some flour with water, a cup of milk and alot of spice!! Ginger is the best spice of all {She left the group!!}."
2,Sorry! Nice try... but I don't think so!,"I think this movie is kind of meaningless. I mean, it has no plot. If there is a plot, then I still haven't figured it out. Plus, the acting is really fake and the girls act like all they care about is boys, mini-mini-mini-skirts, and skimpy outfits that show too much."
1,"HOW ABOUT A BOMB RATING, PLEASE?!",Nominated for 7 Razzie Awards including WORST PICTURE. Won 1 for WORST ACTRESS. THE SPICE GIRLS DEFINITELY DESERVED THEIR RAZZIE AWARD.
1,The Spice Girls are lucky ratings can't go below 1!,"This movie sucks, simple as that. There's no reason to watch and only god know's why it even made a dollar at the box office. Completely useless. I would go on, but it upsets me even thinking about that god-awefull movie again."
2,Sour taste - FULLSCREEN ONLY!! CAVEAT EMPTOR!,I bought this DVD in Oct./'05 for someone who ia a fan (!?!).Her B/day was just last week. She was mortified; I was pissed that even though it was/STILL IS advertised as 1.85:1 the DIC IS ONLY 1.33:1. i personally don't care but the little girl was shattered. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!Edd Kerr iegolden@shaw.ca
3,Heavily Manufactured,"Like all heavily managed and manufactured bands, the spice girls are pleasing to the ear, they dont challange you and you can just sit back and have a good listen. The executives who run the Spice Girls, know what the audience wants, and gives it to them, so it is a CD that is worth a listen, but if you want real music, with emotion and imbuilt talant, with grity lyrics about things that matter, I wouldn't count on finding it here. This is a Cd to listen to when you are driving - it doesnt take to much concentration."
5,"Awesome movie! Great seller, fast shipping!","If in the 90's you were into the spice girls then this is the movie to watch. To some it may be cheesy but to anyone who remember music from the 90's its a classic. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you were a spice girl fan."
2,Easy Riffs,This series of books contains easy riffs - but don't spend much time or money locating them.
5,A foundational book,"I read this book about a year ago, and like my Bible, I find myself going back to it. If you have ever had any questions about where you are in Christ or spiritual maturity, this is a book for not only you and your household. A great gift for every occasion! The Lord's Blessings."
5,Love It-But.. Big Radio Problems,"Let me start off by saying We Love this Toy. However, we are on our 2nd one. We bought our 4 year old a black one for Christmas. We had problems with our radio from day one. In March I stopped by ToysRUs to talk to the manager to tell him the problem. He easily swapped it out and gave us the new pink/purple one. Which was awesome. However, again we started having problems with the radio. It started shutting itself off when you hit a bump, and then decided to stay on and not go off until the batteries ran out. I called the buyers protection plan people and asked about this problem. I was informed they are getting almost daily calls with the radios not working. They suggested having the store manager get in touch with the Manufacturer to see if there will be a fix. Obviously we will still have fun without the radio, but it was a very nice feature. We Would still buy again because my daughter is having the best time with it."
3,New Found Road skips the detour.,"Using the traditional bluegrass instrumentation of guitar, banjo, mandolin, and string bass, New Found Road incorporates an Appalachian old-tyme sound with traditional Country and Bluegrass tunes. The result is a fury of twangy plectrum madness that is lighter on the low end than many of their contemporaries. Purists who fear Rock & Roll rhythms will find solace with ""Somewhere Between"" for this reason, as the bass and banjo fill and roll respectively differing from new-school variations on a 1-4-5. While the Marshall family and the late Jimmy Martin are obvious influences, traces of Celtic Ballads can also be heard between their three-part vocal harmonies. New Found Road consists of Rob Baker on mandolin and vocals, Tim Caudill on upright bass and vocals, Tim Shelton on guitar & vocals, and Jr. Williams on banjo and vocals, and Jim Vanclave on fiddle. (...)"
4,Just get it,"After the release of two excellent albums (""Filth hounds of hades"" and ""Power of the hunter""), Ward and the Brabbs brother recruited a second guitar player - Mick Tucker - and recorded their third album titled ""This means war"". With this album, Tank continued their raw, unpolished but still melodic heavy metal. Even if the production could be better, there's plenty of enjoyable stuff here. ""Just like something from hell"", ""Laughing in the face of death"", ""This means war"", ""Echoes of a distand battle"" and ""If we go (we go down fighting)"" are all high class metal tunes from the eara of New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and if you are a fan of early Iron Maiden or Motorhead, my guess is that you might find this album irresistible. Get it and crank it up!"
3,Not an indispensible Julie London CD,"I recently acquired ""Julie London Sings the Standards"" from Amazon.com, and found it to be a definite 5-star experience. Her sensuous and sultry way with a song is addictive. I recently acquired this CD hoping she would do for Cole Porter what she had done for other great song-writers. While there were a couple of memorable tracks, I was disappointed by the number that just didn't jell. I had the impression that most of the songs were recorded before everyone had gotten to the level of mastery where they had ""made them their own."" The only 5-star Julie London album I have personally come across is the one I mentioned above: ""Julie London Sings the Standards."""
5,Purr-fection,"Imagine a hushed, smoke-filled Hollywood nightclub, one-thirty in the morning, 1965. From a corner booth, Frank Sinatra signals for a last round as a combo takes the small stage to close the night out with a loose, sexy half-hour set of Cole Porter standards. Russ Freeman slumps at the piano, delicately leading the way. Bud Shank closes his eyes and weaves his typically fluid sax lines, while the great Joe Pass follows on guitar. And at the microphone, smooth-as-silk, cool-as-ice, Julie London, enthrallingly world-weary, deliciously pitch-perfect. Who could ask for more?Although not really a live set, ""All Through The Night"" evokes just this type of atmosphere (much better, in fact, than London's actual live recording of the previous year, the uncharacteristically goofy ""In Person at The Americana"".) Ignore the insipid new liner notes and the incongruous bonus cut from a recording session five years prior, pour yourself a cocktail, turn down the lights, and enjoy!"
3,Alanbrooke's perspective - written in realtime,"What makes this book worth reading is it is from Alanbrooke's diary which he wrote during the wife mostly with the idea of letting his wife know what was happening. He then later went through it and made notes in preparation for his history of the war.So it includes what he was thinking at that time rather than just how he remembered things. This is what makes this a good book.On the flip side, as the intro says, a lot was held back because it would be upsetting to others. It's also, while not boring, repetitious in places. That probably is a reflection of what he went through, the same arguments with the same people - primarily Churchill and Admiral King.But it mostly suffers from the fact that it does not dive in to the real interesting questions and I think that is due to the parts he held out."
4,"Early blues, Jazz",Great Early blues and jazz rock from an incredibly under rated band. I do not know how some bands make it and others do not. Promo people should be fired for not pushing these guys.
3,Still good!,"A little lamer than Halfbreed or Overdog, but most things are! This album has some good stuff. Miller Anderson is (was) one of the best vocalists out there. The absence of Spit James is felt. His guitar is missing here. Miller can play, but Spit can sizzle (that doesn't sound right!). I questions some of the chosen tracks, but what the heck, there is enough good stuff here to justify the purchase."
1,Purchase only if prepared to puchase a new set of teeth after!,"these are stale, and hard as a rock. the gum inside is basically as hard as the candy. chipped my tooth. dont waste ur money on this bc the dentist is not fun and NOT cheap."
3,Sunbeam Burst of Power hand mixer,"This mixer is powerful, comfortable to hold, has a nice long cord....BUT.... the placement of the cord is in the worst possible place. Instead of it being on the side, it's right on the bottom and every time you sit the mixer down, it falls over. As a custom cake decorator I've been through countless mixers in the last 25 years, and even though I have always loved the burst of power mixer, this newest design is by far the worst. I don't know why they changed the design in the first place, the old one was perfect. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. In this case, it might be a nice looking and strong mixer, but it's the most frustrating. You're working with batters or doughs which is messy enough, but when a heavy mixer falls over and takes the bowl with it... imagine the frustration.That one small adjustment in the placement of the cord, and I would have given this mixer 5 stars instead of 3."
3,Track Listing,1. A Mover La Colita (Radio Edit) 3:162. A Mover La Colita (Chazz's Original Vocal Mix) 6:333. A Mover La Colita (Armand's Tuff American Mix) 6:374. A Mover La Colita (Mo Go Main Vocal Mix) 6:315. A Mover La Colita (DJ Stew's Joyful Dub) 4:51
4,The Anti-Vietnam War movement set to music by Country Joe,"Country Joe & The Fish/ Collectors Items/ The First Three EPs: The famous song here is ""I feel like I'm fixin to die rag"" (made famous at Woodstock) and this CD gives us three different studio versions of that song (all very interesting ones too). This is a good CD for those who like tongue-in-cheek radical songs and/or are interested in the 1960's anti-war movement. There is a funny protest song against LBJ (""Superbird"") as well as a very funny song against Richard Nixon (""Tricky Dick""). On the whole, a very interesting and entertaining CD but not what I would call Essential music."
3,"Light, easy read with heart but no depth.","This novel seems to cover a lot of ground without getting in too deep. The most interesting characters are not the romantic leads but a middle-aged housekeeper and a 4 year old girl. We know all these facts about the main characters but it never really builds a 3 dimensional picture of them. It's still a fun, romantic read even without the depth and with the predictability.My greatest criticism is for the portrayal of the male romantic lead. I understand that guilt was his driving force but it was an illogical, self-indulgent type that made him seem very self centred. It's a trait in male romantic leads that bothers me and is used too frequently by Romance authors. It's almost narcissistic which is a personality trait that very rarely seems to go away in real life.The audio copy I listened to was narrated by Daisy Wheeler who was a very good choice. Her vocal characterisations of Kiki the housekeeper and Christie the 4 year-old girl were inspired."
2,Eclectic trash,"this item came out well after eric burton and the animals had passed thier prime...the same people who made a hit out of""We gotta get out of this place""had apparently discovered,by the time this mess was released,that fame(and popularity)is indeed fleeting,and thiers was already over...Every then popular youthful style was slap-dashed together onto this album,apparently in the forlorn hope that somebody somewhere would like something...I like""St.James Infirmry""but then I like blues and this version is done in a blues style..Most of the rest of the album seems to be loud and over-long...Sure,there are listeners out there who favor eclectic offerings over theme-oriented packages,but I will bet that,in the case of this item,they are few in number..."
5,One Sophisticated Animal,"This is a very personal album for me. My best friend got it on vinyl for my birthday when I was visiting him and his family in Boise, ID one year for the summer so it brings back some pleasant memories. I finally managed to get it on cd. Aside from that, I dig the well-produced funkiness of the rock, blues, and spoken word swirling around. The 1960s had a hodgepodge of musical styles bubbling in the brew, and this was a nice fit. Not for everyone, but give it a quick listen if you get the chance. It strikes some chord in me that I can't quite describe, and maybe it will bring out something lurking inside of you as well."
1,"Too basic, too vague, too poorly written","If you know absolutely nothing about wellness, this book might be useful -- but, by 2004, most folks know that fast food isn't as healthy as organic vegetables, much tap water is laden with chemicals, and people can improve their health by changing their diets. This might have been news in 1966, but it isn't news now.The book not only preaches, it preaches badly: the author's writing begs for editing, as she clearly doesn't have much skill as an author. Clearly, though, the unknown press clearly doesn't have an editor on its staff.Well-intentioned, but much less useful than most other books on the topic. It is not worth the price of the book to get the pages and pages of record-keeping sheets.I sent it back."
5,Product review for hand held grater,Found this product to be very easy to use and very easy to cleaned. I am very satisified with the price and product.
4,Excellent Value For The Price,I am sure you can spend a lot more on a cheese grater -- but why? This cheese grater works just fine and my friends are blown away when I whip it out and a block of fresh romano or parmesan. That little green can from Kraft can't compare and fresh cheese is actually cheaper!
1,Try a different grater,This grater really does not work as advertised. Harder cheeses take forever to grind and soft ones get stuck in the grating tube. Try a different grater - this one ain't work the 20 bucks.
2,It is functional...,"Well, I'm not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater. Yes, it will grate cheese, but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1/4 of an inch. This allows for the cheese to get 'gummed' up and eventually that large wad just falls through. Also, for harder cheeses this means you're constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated.I've yet to find a rotary grater I'm happy with. I've broken several plastic models within 2 days of owning them. While I've yet to break this metal model, it just doesn't perfrom very well. I'm still using my stand-up grater."
2,Not What It Seems,"This grater has one major problem. It oozes cheese out of the base while you grate. Easy to clean, but I am going back to my box grater."
1,Awful Cheese grater,The grater worked awful. It grates very slow and difficult to manage. I would not recommend this product at all.
3,You could do better.,"Not the easiest thing in the world to clean, and I don't like how it grates. In the end, I think I'd have been much happier with a plastic grater... the type they use in most restaurants like olive garden, etc. This one doesn't do too well with harder cheeses. I got the metal one so that it wouldn't start smelling of cheese, but really, that's all that I will use it for, since i don't trust it with hard chocholate."
1,Aroma sai vacuum,This is not a good product to purchase. It has terrible suction and is very loud. When we tried to clean out the tank all the dirt stuck into the hard corners. I would not recommend this product. I returned the vacuum.
4,Pretty Impressive,"This little vacuum is pretty impressive. It is great on hardwood floors and small area rugs. I would not recommend this type of vacuum cleaner for large carpet surfaces. A great variety of attachments are included. The only downside is that they advertise it to be an aroma vacuum, but do not include any samples of oils that can be used or information on purchasing them."
1,Not what I had hoped,"I was very excited to get this vacuum and try it out, but sadly it was not as good as I had hoped. I have allergies and my mother has asthma, so we hoped this vacuum would do a good job of picking up dust and debris.It picks up surface dust but hardly any debris from carpets or rugs, and it does not do any deep cleaning. The attachment is not big or strong enough to do much. I suppose it might be good for hard floors. I had to put a lot of time, sweat, and effort when vacuuming with this machine because it took me so much longer to clean. Cleaning the tank or the brushes was no picnic either. Sorry, but had to return it."
1,Terrible Vacuum,Bought this vacuum 9 months ago and use it usually once a week. The vacuum is terrible difficult to clean and if you have pet hair the beater bar is completely useless it didn't work after the third time. suction got worse the longer i had it and now its broke in under a year and warranty is only 90 days!!! the part that attaches the hose to the cannister has two little plastic tabs and they broke as i was vacumming the tile i didnt pull hard or anything just broke! you cant avoiding taking the hose on and off as you have to clean the darn thing everytime you use it and that is the only way in and out of the tank. dont buy this unit it is terrible!!!
1,waste,"IF I DID NOT THROW AWAY THE BOX, ETC. I WOULD RETURN THIS. DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG HYPE IS ABOUT. MY UPRIGHT VACUUM PUTS THIS TO SHAME. IT DID NOT CLEAN MY CARPETS, OR MAKE THEM LOOK CLEAN."
1,Disappointment,"I just got Box with the vacuum and parts but no owner manual and no instruction book (no warranty page too),No idea what model of HEPA filter is it...How do I discovered this ??? well, by goggling the Internet and find this video http://vzaar.com/videos/781395Not happy at all. :("
2,Hard to find spare parts,This Vacuum cleaner worked very nicely until one day the pipe that conects to the hose from the handle broke and I have never been able to find the spare part anywhere. What seemed like a great deal ended up not being such.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I just received this product and it is very cheaply made. The light will only stay on if you giggle the switch. I will be returning it.
3,Works Fine,I have used the light constantly in my car since its purchase from Amazon.com. It works fine. My only complaint is that it does not coverenough area if you use a big dictionary in the car as I do.
1,NO TECHNIQUE AT ALL !,"For God's sake ! I never bought anything from Maiden again, since Adrian Smith left the band. I only bought ""No PRayer For The DYing"", and then I saw things were over. Listen to these live songs: only energy (which is good) but the technique is completely gone! Janick Gers changed all great Smith's solos (to worse) and even Dave Murray seems to play ""loose"". I don't understand why. But fans are always fans, and I think that's why this CD received so many 5-stars ratings."
5,so hard to find,this is a great album . but its so hard to find. i don't think there is a bad song on it.. its like a secret album..... i am lucky i have the lp and listen to it all the time. i was station in San Francisco in 1970 -1971 . which is the reason i have it . if you could find it i would buy it .
5,I also love this album,This album is a warm fuzzy from the early 70s for me. It is very unfortunte that this hasn't been continuously available. I was able to get a copy last year directly from Country Joe's web site. You had to buy a box set that included 3 other cds. The other cds were ok but I was really buying the set for this cd. I think I paid about 40 which was a reasonable price for the set. Unfortunately he doesn't have that set available any more but you are probably more likely to come across it someday at his web site versus the ridiculous prices I'm seeing here on Amazon for used copies. Support Joe directly. He has a lot of other good stuff.
4,Good first book to a series,"I liked this book. I thought it was a good intorduction to the series as well. It gives some outline to every point with just enough, but not too much information to make you look foreward to the next books to come. In comparison to other books, I dont think it is up there with the best, but it is good. It is an entertaining read. Its funny with a good plot and the characters are gems in themselves. I hope we get to see some of them in the books to come. I recommend this book to everyone."
2,So disappointed...,"I usually like Dodd's books, but I was very disappointed in this one. My first problem was that I really couldn't see why the characters liked each other, much less why they would fall in love.And I really didn't like Clarice. She kept talking about how it was her duty to return to her kingdom and make a dynastic marriage, but she gave up her viriginity the first time Robert touched her.Robert semmed upset before Clarice left, but afterward he was okay because she'd told him to ""be happy"". It seemed like he'd gotten over her pretty quick. But when she came back, he had all this powerful emotion again.All in all, I disliked the hero and heroine so much that I just couldn't enjoy the book."
3,Christina Dodd is a better author than this!,"This story drags, the plotline is thin, and I just wanted it to end. There was enough meat to the story, however, to hook me into buying the two sequels. I have read other Christina Dodd novels, and I am a fan. So I know she is a much better author than any of the books in this series proves. Disappointing."
3,Good Read,"It's not ""AMAZING"" romance by any means. But it was definetly a good read. I'd recommend it if your favorite writers -- much like mine -- are busy writing something new and you need something to tide you over :)"
5,I wish I was a princess in one of Christina Dodd's books,"I've read RUNAWAY PRINCESS and SOMEDAY MY PRINCE, and her princesses always face incredible problems resourcefully and bravely (sometimes not so bravely inside) and they get the best guys in romance. It's Christina Dodd's heroes who really work, this strong alpha guys who start out being overbearing and by the end of the book the heroine has brought him to his knees. That's why I want to be a princess in Christna Dodd's books. I want one of those guys."
3,Glorious,"I'm not a recording expert, but I found this cd to be a treasure. Maybe it's the Gounod work itself, as well as the Te Deum that keeps anyone who's performing it from going wrong. I've enjoyed the music for years now, so much that I'm ordering 2 other recordings of the Gounod Mass. They may be better renditions; one which I've listened to some brief clips of does sound better. But for all the enjoyment I've had out of playing this cd, I can't in good conscience allow it to go so maligned. I hope I'll be pleasantly surprised at even better renditions after I receive the other 2."
5,Timeless!,"The songs on this compact disc could be applied to our own lives. The lyrics are poignant, the melodies-pretty. The studio ambiance is easy-going.I was well aware that Mr. Doherty is a gifted singer. His romantic voice exudes warmth and honesty. But I had no idea what an exceptional songwriter he is! His self-penned Don't You Be Fooled is totally evocative. He collaborates with other songwriers on this album, besides. In fact, he comes up with one of the best ballads in the business this way, called Gathering the Words.But I like the faster stuff best. Still Can't Hear the Music is my personal pick; It's country, and it rocks!Along with his own 12-string guitar playing, Mr. Doherty surrounds himself with a bevy of high-caliber musicians. Because this compact disc has magnificent clarity and a high sound quality, you'd think Mr. Doherty and his entourage were performing live right before your very eyes!Which all makes Watcha Gonna Do - timeless!"
2,"USEFUL AND NECESSARY INFORMATION, BUT FULL OF ERRORS","CHAPTER EIGHT ""Face on a Plague"" starts of with an inaccurate statement, and it was very disappointing!!!!!!"
1,Leaches Metal,"I purchased this item months ago from Amazon for the purpose of good health by getting away from containers that leach chemicals. Today I happened to clean my pitcher and noticed the cleaning cloth had black all over it. I cleaned and cleaned the pitcher (4 times) and still black on the cleaning cloth, which now smells like metal. This pitcher is NOT polished on the inside and releases metal into everything you drink. I do not want to ingest metals. Very very disappointed. Will be contacting maker ASAP.After researching the company, MIU France, it turns out France has nothing to do with its manufacturing, its made in china by Xinhua Corp!If you bought one of these pitchers, use a paper towel and wipe the inside hard and you'll see what I mean."
4,"Sharp, Heavy, Sturdy","I found this knife from a review of knives that said this was the best in the affordable range. I picked it up on Amazon for even more of a discount. That being said, I was sure I wouldn't be impressed. - I was wrong! - I've had this knife for about a month and have used it quite extensively. I have diced onions, minced garlic, sliced tomatos, chopped all kinds of herbs, shaved baking chocolate, cubed flank stake and a bunch of other things you'll do with this knife. I've only had to sharpen it once - the edge keeps very well. I'm impressed with this knife and am sure that as long as I properly care for it - hand wash, use a chopping board or flexible mat - my knife will perform far into the future."
5,chicago centrurion chefs knife,excelent balance and gripsharp edge holding well- absolutly love it. i have worked with chicago knives before this is one of the best
4,Nice knife,I ordered this for my son who started a new job in food prep. He tells me he loves the knife and it works great!
3,Sharpness,"Ok I was given 4 steak knives and the 8 Inch Chef Knife for Christmas last year and found after using the large knife for a couple things that it was not sharp anymore. Not like when took it out of the package the first time. We do have a knive sharpening tool it looks like I don't know a round item that we got from much cheaper knives quite a few years ago and somy husband sharpened the knife ""thought it was a life time knife"" and alright it was sharp again, but have to sharpen each time want to use or every other time. When husband bought for a gift seeing it had a lifetime warranty, maybe it would stay sharp for a lifetime but maybe we are a little ignorant to the Lifetime warranty, and they don't tell you in the directions you have to sharpen. So as far as sharpness, it's ok but have to resharpen all the time......."
5,A must have first knife,"Great price considering the excellent quality. It has the feel of more expensive knives I've bought since. If you are going to get 1 knife for your kitchen on a budget, it should be this one."
2,Not that Wonderful,"I was disappointed in this book. It is primarily a group of plot synopses for the various authors' works, with very little analysis. There is also no bibliography. For anyone with even a cursory knowledge of these books, you will not find anything of note here."
2,Not so warm!!,Material is real cheap!!! Doesnt keep my baby warm! I need to put a sweater on her under the coat!!To keeo her from shaking!
2,A bit boring here and there,"This book on the life and crimes of Harry Lavender seems to lack the intesity that books need in today`s society. Set in Sydney the book is written on the basis that the reader has been there. Marele Day seems to have put to much complication into it for th average reader. It is a book which seems to relate in someway to the film ""the big Sleep"" in that the reader has to figure alot of stuff out by himself. All in all the author has gone into a bit too much detail."
5,Tantra Lounge 5 is worth buying!,"Relaxing tracks, great for background music! I could play some of these tracks on repeat and go to sleep to them, but I think since it's Tantra Lounge, it was meant for more active pleasures! :) Either way, enjoy! Fast shipping and secure shipping, so the seller is a keeper, too!"
5,A great find!,This recording of Madam Butterfly is very good. I was impressed by the quality of the music. Giacomo Aragall shows why he is regarded as one of the best tenors of the past thirty years. His notes are flowing and beautiful. At this price you can't go wrong.
5,Grat Music and Great album!,"The price of this record is impressive, and the quality of it too. You`ll find in this album a good performance, the great music of Giacomo Puccini creates the atmosphere of a Japanese history fo love and tragedy. This is a good record. The quality of the sound is good and the performance is very good. You'll enjoy it too."
4,GOOD PRODUCT BUT NO HINT OF HOW TO OBTAIN SERVICE,GREAT BACKUP TO CELLPHONE SERVICE IF YOU LIVE IN OR TRAVEL TO AREAS WITH NO SIGNAL STRENGTH FOE YOUR CELL.GETTING SERVICE WAS AN ADVENTURE BUT CAN BE DONE IF YOU KEEP TRYING.HINT: GLOBALSTAR.COM.
1,Problem with Lightscribe side,"I usually use the memorex lightscribe disks but saw the HP versions and decided to give them a try. The first three disks out of the package would not burn the image correctly. On one with a pictures and text, the picture was completely blurry and distorted. The second one I tried just text and it was completely distorted and unreadable. I tried a different lightscribe drive and just text again and that time only one of the 5 words even printed. I returned this terrible product and went back to Memorex - which worked beautifully again with text and photos - the first one out of the case!"
1,Won't do LightScribe in my Pioneer drive,Just installed a new Pioneer DVR-1910LS (DVR-113NP) and found that I cannot burn labels on these H-P CDs. Tried 3 out of the pack with no success -- each time was told that no media was present in the drive.Then I bought a pack of Memorex 52X LightScribe CD-Rs and had no problem whatever.
1,not what I expected,"i bought a 25 pack waiting to print a cool picture on the discs, but what I get was just a blurry image. There must be a standard for this kind of products!!"
1,Can't rate what I never received,"After ordering the HP Lightscribe CD's, ANTOnline shipped them, UPS made one delivery attempt and for reasons unknown returned my CD's to ANTOnline. UPS offered to cover the shipping cost but instead ANTOnline ripped me off in the name of restocking fee's."
5,Discs of happy memories,I recently bought these discs to put my picures on for my children. I put a picture on the disc of the person that the disc represents. I had no problem whatsoever with the pictures on the discs. I am really enjoying them and have purchased two more packages to use. I highly recommend these. I have seen reviews that weren't as possitive but they were using them as music cds. For pictures they are great
2,Too Many Bad CDs,"I was happy when the product arrived. Delivery was very timely, and the item was packaged well. I have quite a few CDs to record and have found so far (I am still in the process of recording) that 7 out of 25 are bad. I don't think I need to wait until I'm done to say that this is a bad batch of CDs. I'm disapointed at the waste of time as well as money. I have a HP computer so it makes sense to me that I would use HP CDs. I'm not understanding why the label gos on the coated side rather then the shiny side, because the colors on the label template aren't visable.I won't get through my current recording session before I run out of CDs. I like the idea of recording on Lightscribe CDs, it just neater, but I don't know if I will buy this product again.The CDs that did record has a nice clear sound."
5,"Great product, works perfectly.","Great product, works perfectly. I particularly like the LightScribe so I can prin directly on the CDs. I recoommend to anyone who is considering buying a LightScribe CD."
3,Track Listing,"1. Luv Connection (Towa's Radio Edit) (4:40)2. Amai Seikatsu (Towa's Winter Samba) (4:20)Vocals - Maki Nomiya of Pizzicato 53.

4,Excellent British blues from John Mayall's ex-drummer,"When Keef Hartley was sacked by John Mayall he assembled a fine band of British bluesmen and recorded this excellent album in 1968. This is British blues at its finest with exemplary playing by all. Listening to this you wonder why Mayall sacked Hartley as his drumming is faultless and inventive. Miller Anderson's vocals are strident and Skip James, who was never heard of again after this, provides sizzling guitar solos. Its a great shame that this album is no longer available on CD. Hartley's follow-up albums were relatively disappointing as he drifted more towards big band jazz-rock. Buy this if you can find it."
5,Intensely paced action with accurate detail.,"Many thrillers - no, make that many -books-, lose a lot of credibility by making errors in the details. Ross sets forth a scenario that is original as far as my (active) reading in the thriller genre can see. He maintains credibility for the scenario by not dropping the detail ball. No magazine changes in revolvers here...when someone makes that kind of error and then expects me to believe they know what they're writing about, it falls flat. Ross' work stands tall. Another thing I really liked about the book were the 'everyday heroes' in it. Heroic folk and actions portrayed realistically - neither the 'loser turns over a new leaf' fantasy or cardboard superheroes. A very impressive first effort. One of the great things about reading a great first novel is looking forward to following the writer's career. More, Mr. Ross, more!"
4,Great mix of blues styles,"This CD has all kinds of blues styles - piano, harmonica, strong guitar, horns and organ. All the songs are strong, but I especially like ""Frankie's Blues"", ""Kiss Me Baby"" and ""Blues for Al and Peggy"" - do you think it should be called ""Bundy Blues"" instead?"
3,How much would you pay for a bag of chocolate pretzels?,"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping)."
5,A MUST HAVE...CLASSIC!,"A stolen classic returns!The year is 1999. As a college student who loves jazz music so much I studied math to it, this was a necessity to my diskman. Any TRUE fan of music will soon see this once purchasing this milestone. You see this was his FIRST solo album...The lineup featured stars like Chick (Corea) on keys, Andy Bey and Dee Dee Bridgewater...It has a ""Light As A Feather""-like Return To Forever, signature sound to it. The solos on this album crash upon the ear like the gale that smashes waves against cliffs. But it accomplishes so with the subtlety of the tide receding with the coming of dawn...Sadly enough this cd was thiefed from me. I looked for two years all over and finally to my surprise, Amazon has it. I will always be a customer for this..."
1,"Awful singing, ok musically","I must admit I thought this would be great - an alternative to Return To Forever, with Pat Martino on guitar and Dee Dee Bridgewater on vocals! Man, was I ever disappointed. You can barely hear Martino, production is very lackluster, songwriting just ok, and here is the worst part - the male singer is so bad, that he just ruins the record, making it really unlistenable. Dee Dee is a great singer, but this guy is really terrible. Get the real thing - RTF, or go for the later Stanley Clarke albums, which are excellent."
3,"Readable cosmology book, unsatisfying thesis","The Prophet and the Astronomer attempts as its goal to connect historically religious attitudes toward the heavens with the modern cosmological implications for spiritual identity. Both are different facets of the same quest for meaning that man has undertaken since ancient times.Unfortunately, the thesis more-or-less devolves into ""Ancients used to think that comets were harbingers of doom. Today we know they are balls of ice and rock hurtling around the solar system.""Not very illuminating.What Gleiser does do well -- but not nearly as well as numerous other authors -- is describe principles and developments of modern cosmology to popular audiences. For this, however, the reader would do much better to turn to Brian Greene, Martin Rees, or Hawking (to name a few)."
5,"Relentless, gripping, enlightening tale.","Read this in a British translation many years ago. After all these years it remains for me the most memorable of the ""jungle"" novels by Traven. Of course, all of them are exceptional, and all should be read. This novel has the ring of truth, a truth that indicts the comfortable and complacent, a truth from which most of us would like to avert our gaze, but truth nonetheless. This is Traven at his most powerful."
2,Don't buy this edition,"I bought this publisher's edition of ""The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre"" and was sorely disappointed. The glossy texbook-like binding is strong enough, but the text is set badly and on inferior pulp paper. I would not be surprised to learn that this is a rebound trade paperback- although it does not seem to be of high enough quality for even that. The price tag on these editions is completely unjustified. Buy the trade paperback.The book: excellent. This edition: bad."
4,Powerful story,Traven's Jungle series is the gripping saga of the Mexican struggle for hope and dignity.
4,"Useful, if Dated, Information on Timber Engineering","This book, published in 1948, has much useful information. It gives much background on the grading of lumber and the establishing of design stresses. Interestingly, lumber up to the astonishing size of 30 inches by 30 inches is considered. (p. 45).There are the customary beam formulas, as well as ones for assembled wooden I-beams and box beams. There is also data on the design of columns, fastenings, floor systems, plywood, etc. One large table gives loads as a function of beam length and allowable fiber stress. Some worked examples are included, but it would be helpful if there were more of them."
4,Graet Hijinks at Sea with the US Navy,"Retired Admiral Daniel V. Gallery tells the tales of Navy seamen who make the best of what's available to them. Riproaringingly funny, you'll love the antics of Fatso and his cronies as they make trouble at sea."
4,"Nice light, can be semi-flush or flush mount","Nice light for the price, definitely got a great deal. Well packaged and arrived in a reasonable amount of time."
5,Most Sought After British Badge Book,"""British Army Proficiency Badges"" by Edward Langley and Denis Edwards ranks with ""Badges & Insignia of the British Armed Services"" (1974), by Royal Navy COmmander W.E. May, Deputy Director W.Y. Carman (F.S.A., F.R. Hist,S) of The National Army Museum, and John Tanner (M.A., Ph.D, F.R. Hist.S), Director of the Royal Air Force Museum. This is the most sought after book by collectors of British insignia, followed by Badges & Insignia of the British Armed Services, of course! These books rank among the books by Henry Alexander Ogden, Brian L. Davis, Guido Rosignoli, Colonel Dion Williams, and Rear Admiral J.W. Bunkley. This book fetches over US$100.00 in hard bound and US$75.00 in paperback copies and it is rarely offered in auction or from rare book dealers. Sarge Booker"
3,"Suspenseful and interestingly written, but not very believable","The suspense part was very well done, the writing, while maybe a bit much at times was interesting, but I just didn't find it believable that Johnny Marr would have access, resources, ability etc to track, arrange etcall those things."
5,"Dark, disturbing and poetic","Rendezvous in black is about this guy Johnny who finds his fiancee killed by something dropped off a plane - an accident, pure and simple. This triggers a fundamental reaction in Johnny -- a gruesome fate awaits the passengers of that plane...It's an excellent book, but then I've never read anything by Cornell Woolrich that hasn't been excellent. The language is somewhat complex, and Cornell's quick shifts from plain language to metaphors are sometimes a bit confusing, but also quite poetic.Warning: the downmost review contains spoilers for the ultimate fate of the main characters of the book!"
3,It was ok . . .,"I LOVE this book, and I was so excited to teach it! I purchased this guide because I needed a place to start. It was ok, but honestly, I'm not crazy about it. The quizzes and vocabulary are pretty good, but I was not at all impressed with the activities. I really don't know that I'll be able to use any of them . . . I don't know. It might be worth the purchase for the quizzes, but personally I wouldn't recommend spending the money if you are looking mainly for new activity ideas."
4,Teacher's Guide,"This teacher's guide is a very useful tool in the classroom. It came with well-written questions, so I do not have to write my own! I look forward to using the activities with my students."
1,The Giver,"In my opinion this was a BAD book to read. At first I was very interested in it, but towards the end it faded out. I think it could have had a better ending! It was hard to follow along. Over all I wouldn't read this book unless I had to. DON'T READ IT!"
1,What a stupid book,That was one BAD book! It didn't talk about anything really. It jumped around too much. Hard to follow. Don't read it!
4,charming but trite,"Ponyboy Curtis lives in a world where there are only two types of people - those with all the breaks and those who just get broken- the Socs and the Greasers. When Ponyboy finds himself hiding from the police because he and his best friend are wanted for the murder of a member of their rival gang, it is clear to Ponyboy what type of life he can expect. Things seem as bad as they can be. But will Ponyboy be able to come to terms with who he is or will he remain just another Greaser? Find out in The Outsiders. Even though The Outsiders was written in 1967, S.E. Hinton's portrayal of gang life is as poignant today as it was then. Though the dated slang and the trite ending might turn off young readers, Ponyboy's struggle with loyalty and the search for independence are timeless.SynopsisA revealing picture of the tension between loyalty toward friends and family and the struggle for individuality in the life of a young gang member."
4,"Here's a novel with a Twist - Oliver Twist, that is...","Like most Dickens books, Oliver Twist is well written and filled with characters as real as the people we know. It is not over-done with lengthy, tedious descriptions or subplots that drone on and on. It is very tightly written and fun to read. Dickens indicts the society at the time for its treatment of children and the poor, using sarcsm and wit. That one of the main villains is a jew was a courageous choice for him. Very realistic and gritty."
4,Oliver Twist,Oliver Twist is a classic; always loved Charles Dickens style of writing. I think a must read for all ages.
2,did not enjoy the character portrayal,"I believe that in order for this book to be completely comprehendable for a high school student, skip the first few chapters. Know where he was born, about his mother, and that he cries constantly. I was made to read this book, and while I enjoyed the ending, the beginning drug on for me."
2,Book is a mess,"It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book.This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad."
1,OK at times- overall boring,"I read this book as an assignment and really did not enjoy it. I thought the characters were not very developed and as mentioned before, Dickens was paid by the word and I think he went off on tangents that had little or no relevance to the overall plot. At parts it was fairly amusing but most of the time, was boring and drawn out."
1,A force feed book!,This book is the worst book ever. The only reason a person should read this book is if they are forced to or they like to hear about thieves.
4,Classic,"The strength of this particular edition is of course in the delightful original illustrations. They incorporate the sharp wit that pervades Dickens' work. In terms of plot development 'Oliver Twist' is not Dickens' strongest or cleverest novel, but the story is simply delightful. The characters are deliciously convincing in their respective likeability or odiousness, and each and everyone one (apart from poor Dick and Nancy), seem to come to their well-deserved end. It is certainly a Dickens' lover's must-read."
4,Classic,Enjoying the irony of Charles Dickens. He has an excellent way with words. The story builds an excellent understanding of the context of England during that period.
3,Reported,It could have been a little better but I did like the ending it was exiting and if you like this book you should read it again or not
4,Good read,"Great story! The old English got tiresome sometimes, but overall a good read. Especially, for a free book. I recommend."
3,Boston Area Book Report,"The nawvel I read was cawled Olivah Twist; I know, queeeeeah name. Actually, I was nawt that bad though."
2,Way Too Descriptive,"The plot line was good and had plenty of twists, but the way it was written was horrible. There was way too much description for the stupidest things. I know, it is interesting to know how the characters look, and this book does do that. But, his comparisons were drawn out and boring! Dickens would be writing about Oliver's trip to the country with Rose and Mrs. Maylie, but he would end up talking about angels in heaven and how their cheeks were a similar shade as that of a kind of flower. I mean, this is a very creative way of describing a flower, but that is not the point of the story! And when that description occupies two or three pages, the reader becomes a little discouraged(not to mention bored!!!!) I've read David Copperfield though, and Charles Dickens' writing style seemed to have evolved into something much more tolerable. Unless you are easily amused, I don't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of about 17."
3,"It was a good, interesting book.",It was pretty good book. I think it shows how orphans struggle. I think that it helps some of us that are not orphans see how emotional it is for them to go throught. I liked it.
4,Oliver Twist...,"I found it to be a well-drawn book; the storyline and the characters involved were very entertaining, particularly the story between Fagin and his charges. Although sometimes it tended to extend the text longer than needed and the constant switching between scenes made it hard to follow. But I do acknowledge that this may be due to my lack of patience and comprehension and may attempt reading it again in the latter of my years."
3,I thoght it was pretty good.,"I think it might have been a little above my reading level. I'm thirteen. I read it for school and I thought at times it was very exciting and I didn't want to put it down. Sometimes, however, it got kind of boring. Especially when the theives were talking I could hardly understand what they were talking about. It was an okay book. I might read it again when I'm a little older."
2,Not Dicken's Best- Drawn out and boring,"Oliver Twist was certainly not Dicken's best work. It carried on and on about irrelevant issues that did not relate to the novel's actual plot. Although it depicted the lives of the lowerclass in the Victorian era fairly accurately, it showed the upperclass as ""good"" people trying to help the lowerclass; This was obviously not accurate. The book wrote in 550 pages what could have been summed up nicely in 200 pages."
4,THIS ONE SOUNDS 'ORIGINAL',"Like the Shakespearean Works, all the famous novels Charles Dickens wrote have been edited into various lengths and breadths. The point being that each editor trys to outdo his/her predecessor by evolving 'something special'. All are welcomed; although I would add that this particular version of ""Oliver Twist"" seems to be the most 'original' I have come across. It is quite detailed, and has all the flavours of 19th century English.However, for most leisure readers who just want to have fun, I will recommend the Mass Market Paperback version. Its story is more abridged: more direct; and boasts of the contemporary English we use today."
4,Oliver Twist-Puffin Classics Edition,"This is not the complete book as Dickens wrote it. It has been slightly abridged for young readers. I used to hate the idea of doing such a thing to a book, but I recently read this out loud to my children and the abrigement makes it much easier for kids to follow. As far as I can tell, about a fourth of Dickens' original has been edited out. The plot seems to be intact, much of what is missing are long descriptive passages. Certainly not for purists, but as an introduction to Dickens, especially kids who have seen one of the many movies versions, this is fine."
4,A good book,It was a good book but there were too many words. A very touching and rich story. You have to be patient with it. A great Dickens novel.
3,Not my favorite Dickens,I love reading Dickens but this was my least favorite. It's a little tedious and doesn't have the depth of David Copperfield.
4,Great series,This is a great way to enjoy oldies. I look forward to each new addition. I can't believe how much I had forgotten of these adventures.
3,slow at first good at end,"i was okay with this book though i would not group it as a favorite. the first half of this book was slow, but the second half was good. the first half took me four days to read, where the second only took 1"
4,There's only one way for a child to learn,"Dicken's understatement is potent enough to kill at a hundred paces, with laughter. The creepy thief lord ends every sentence with the address ""my dear;"" the overdressed Beetle complains when shivering paupers make him feel cold; and those who beat Oliver are encouraged because how else would a child ever learn?"
5,amazing,simply amazing how the author has so many plots that has something to do with Oliver and then brings all the plots together. It is also AMAZING how all the people who have done wrong gets in to trouble
3,"A little challenging, but satisfying also","I read this a few years ago and liked it, although Dickens does seem a tad up himself with the way he writes, 3 stars, if you read the whole thing, you will have probably liked it"
4,The Language is Easier to Understand,"The meandering plots of most Dickens novels leave me cold most of the time, but I found this book easier to understand and enjoy. I'm glad I finally pulled the book off the shelf and read it."
5,The best Dickens book ever,"This book has a lot of excitement about the Orphan Oliver life. This book turned out a wonderful ending. Master Bates, Oliver Twist, Fagin, Mr. Brownlow are great character. Don't read Great Expectations because this book will make you bore a lot."
4,"couldnt do it, i couldnt finish this one","yup, i couldn't finish this one. it was well written, engaging, humorous at times, sad at other times, almost everything that a person could want in a book. it had one major problem though, it really was just too negative. the people were too cruel to each other and there was far too much injustice and dirt, everything was so dirty, dilapidated, dark, discomfort, disquieted minds and any other words you can think of that start with 'd' and end in something unpleasant."
1,Late and Wrong,The item shipped was not the one listed on the website. It was a different edition.It was ordered with express delivery but delivered over a week later.Both of these had a bad impact on a college student. My daughter at Texas Tech will probably go ahead and buy from the bookstore. There was a particular versioon they were looking for Peguin Classics but another version was delivered.I have purchase from you before but didn't have this type of experience and I really don't have the time to try to make phone calls or whatever to try to get my freihgt costs returned but I would be happy to return the book.
2,can you say overrated...,"I here alot about how this book is a classic and how it has an amazing story, blah blah blah... Well, here's a view from a Freshman in HS. This book totally blows. It has some good moments during the action sequences, but in all honesty, Dickens makes this story way longer than it had to be by straying away from Oliver and the thieves. It's not exactly the most absorbing story to read. If your in HS and want a really good book, read Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"" (that's going to be a kick @$$ movie)or ""Watership Down,"" 2 much more exciting adventure stories."
1,This book is terribly overrated. I hated it.,"Don't buy this! It's horrible! The only good part is the character referred to as ""Master Bates."" The story is stupid, pointless, and written in a style that is dull and hard to follow. One paragraph consists of two sentences, one 159 words and the other 175 words. That's what I call a run-on! Only read this if you absolutely have to for school or have sleeping problems!"
1,Literary quality does not exist,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
4,Oliver Twist,"I had to read to read this book for school. The story itself was sometimes boring, but sometimes you really wanted to know what would happen to Oliver Twist.Well, I think that the book 'The christmass carol' was a better and more original story of Charles Dickens. But Oliver Twist was not bad at all, just too much pages."
2,alright,"All in all I thought that this was an alright book but there was a lot of words edited out. What is that? I'm glad I didn't pay for it because that is unacceptable. Books are meant to be read in their original form, not in some edited retelling."
3,ok,this is an abridge edition and did not follow the book. It skipped parts and chapters. would not recommend for school
4,Never Read Before,I am thoroughly enjoying reading this even thought the language is a bit flower-y. My past expericene has been the play and the movies.
4,loved it,This is one of the best books I have ever read. I loved it from start to finish and this is a book everyone should read. I would recommend it.
4,"A real ""twist""","Read this book by accident. Was very surprised by the intrigue it contained. It was a little hard to follow on occasion due to the old English style, but once into, it became very much worth the read."
5,oliver twist,"I would like to have know how long it was between the updates. I am enjoying it very much, but would like to have the new chapters sooner. I bought 9 serial books and am finding it hard to keep up with what I have read before I get a new episode."
3,This Edition is an Abridgement,"I haven't read the unabridged edition, but I could still detect gaps in the convoluted plot. The reading level is more appropriate for high school students. This book is nearly 400 pages long, so you might as well go the distance and read the original."
3,"Confusing, but really good!","I was assigned this book for a literature circle, and it was a very good plot, starting with the birth of the orphan named Oliver, and his travels to different abusive homes. It then follows the young boy to London, where he falls in among thieves, who force him to break the law. Oliver is then caught in the act of stealing, and tries to keep his head above water. However, a character named Monks has his own plans for the boy.The end of the book was, by far, the best part of the entire story. The writing style of Charles Dickens baffled and bewildered me countless times, but I did get through it, and unless you're willing to give a lot of thought and effort to this novel, I would not suggest reading it."
2,Not my style,"I thought that I might give this old classic a try. It has a neat story line but is just written in the ""old Style"" grammer and gets a bit boring in my opinion."
4,sloppy formatting,"The book is, obviously, a classic. excellent reading. But the formatting is sloppy throughout. Dickens is without a doubt one of my favorite authors. It's a pity I could only rate this a 4."
5,Rather funny!,"Dickens was a very funny guy. The dialogue is hilarious, and I love highlighting particularly snarky passages (ad seeing what other readers found amusing). Definitey worth reading in a serial format, as it's less pressure to finish -- you are obliged to take your time."
3,Was a favorite movie,Not a bad book. Much more dark and sinister then the movie. Like the movie better I think. Yes yes.
4,Oliver Twist,I have always enjoyed Charles Dickens books and was happy to be able to carry this book on my new IPAD. Great for the price - FREE/!
3,Meh.,"I loved A Tale of Two Cities, hated Great Expectations, and just thought this one was okay. I understand the point of the novel, but the characters are so one-dimensional that I found myself struggling to move through the story."
3,Earth Tie Review,The small buckle? on back of tie that keeps both ends of tie flushed against each other came apart on first day of use. Not the best thing to happen if you want your first time customer to purchase products from you again
2,"Good elbow support, but has one serious design problem","Ordinarily, I wouldn't call a sewn in tag a serious design problem, but in this case, it is just plain stupid how the tag is attached. The tag is rather irritating, so I decided to remove it. It appears as though the tag is just sewn onto the upper end of the support, and that you can just remove the stitches and be rid of it. Wrong. The stitches that hold the tag on,are the same stitches that are used to put the brace together. If you cut the stitches, you screw up the integrity of the brace. I expect mine will fall apart a lot sooner than it should now.It would have been nice to have some sort of warning to not remove the friggin tag. They can print a manual in 20 different languages, but they can't be bothered to warn you not to cut the stupid tag off?? It's a good elbow support, but don't make the same mistake I did."
1,"Does not fit well, horrible return policy","I purchased the correct size based on the companies measurement process. The portion of the brace that fits over the forearm seems to fit well, but the portion that sits over the upper arm is SUPER baggy on the backside (tricep) portion of my arm. There is no way this thing would provide any support for me, might as well wear a sock. Unless you are really fat and have a huge amount of flesh on the back of your arm, you will not find a size that will fit and perform as described. Also, their return policy is terrible. Cost me over $40 in shipping and restocking fees to return this pos."
3,"Good product, expensive, horrible sewn tag placement","I purchased this elbow support when I developed painful golf elbow and required some support for exercise and weightlifting.Pros: This elbow support is extraordinarily comfortable, fits well with proper sizing, and provides excellent support for the elbow.Cons: Expensive. Featured a large sewn-in tag on the inside of the support at the bottom center of the bicep which was very uncomfortable. When I removed it, the sewn lining ripped and exposed some elastic(otherwise still works well and has not unravelled further).Bottom Line: Good Product, but much less expensive alternatives exist.I really do like this support, but I have since purchased a shock doctor elbow support for my other arm which is not quite as comfortable, but much cheaper and offers decent support and good flexibility."
2,Hard to put together,"This plane was very difficult to put together. Several members of the family worked on it, but it never could be assembled in a way that allowed it to work well."
1,do not buy this plane!,"Our son was VERY excited to get this plane, and he used birthday money to do so. Unfortunately the plane was very low quality. Putting it together was difficult since the parts didn't fit properly, and the instruction manual was written by someone that does not speak english, therefore, very hard to understand and follow. Also there were parts missing. Once assembled as best as we could with what we had, the plane never got off the ground. The plane broke it's propeller mount and a wing after the one attempt at a launch. What an incredilble disappointment! We do not recomend this plane at all. We ended up going to a local hobby shop that sells planes they stand behind as well as all replacement parts should something break."
1,Piece of junk,"I recieved this a gift. When I was putting it together, I realized that it was a real piece of junk, that it would not fly very well, if at all, and would not survive a rough landing, much less a crash. This is another example of a piece of Chinese made junk. Don't waste your money."
1,waste of money !!!,We bought this plane in good faith as we are beginners. When we started assembling it the instructions were in broken English and very difficult to understand and two parts were missing. We finally managed to assemble it and took it outside and followed the instructions to the letter. We had four attempts of throw starting it using 70% throttle and on every attempt the plane just nose dived. On the fourth attempt the wing broke off as it is very flimsy and the tail broke off. We are very disappointed in this product and would warn all against it. We tried to get our money back from Hobby Planet.co.uk but they say the item cannot be returned as it has been used!! We are now out of pocket with no plane!
1,it is a toy,"if you are going to get into r/c airplanes/go to local hoddie shop and look and ask ? then order online i remend the night vapor by parkzone you can get parts made to fly indoors or outdoors no wind slow flyer good for begginer on r/c helicopters a good toy is the saym 107 i9t flys well and will take a crash i have hit the wall,dog,wife,door almost indistuable"
1,danishherring,This plane was a huge disappointment. It never flew. The propeller assembly broke the first time we tried it. Do not buy this product.
1,piece of junk,I flew this plane once it lost controll and fell nose first brike into 4 peices i put it back together took it back out and propeller broke in half and i cant find were to get anouther one wast of money
4,Much Love and Respect,"That is what this book is all about, love and respect. These two young poets really touch my spirit. I suggest reading ""And it Sparkles"" again and again and again. It's a great poem! Great Book!"
5,The best work of Eric Burdon & the Animals,"Until you've heard it, you will never know. This was Eric Burdon's answer to the Beatles Sgt Peppers LHCB. This is a master work that will never be repeated in any form or function, contained herein, the greatest compilation of music from the 60's I've ever heard. ""In the beginning... Well, you should know by now."" We love you, Eric."
2,"""Bonus"" tracks more like ""Bogus"" tracks","I guess I should listen to the rest of the album, & compare it to my worn-out LP copy to see if this is better, but...I bought this CD for the bonus tracks...specifically, for the ""single version"" of ""Sky Pilot (pt 1 & 2)"". The original 45 RPM release was a vastly different mix, with the ""flanging"" & echo used sparingly, instead of laid on with a trowel as on the LP version. Also the fade-out between parts 1 & 2 began at the guitar solo. The so-called ""single version"" on this CD is just the album track reduced to mono, with all the excess effects, & it doesn't even fade out/in at the correct point. All makes me wish I'd never let go of the 45 I bought back in December '68. I expected that someone would have dug deeper in the archives & remastered the (better) 45 mix to digital"
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this as a wedding gift for my cousin. When it came in, it was much smaller than expected and it had black goop on it that wouldn't come off. I immediately sent it back because it was so gross."
5,Nice ice bucket,Nice item for the price. We are using it in our bridal suite at a hotel. It is holding up nicely.
3,For Avant-Garde Heads Only!,"Cecil Taylor's work is characterized by hard-hitting, VERy fast piano playing that doesn't conform much to traditional jazz structures of melody or rhythm. It requires having approached jazz through some other course first to appreciate, which in a nutshell means that if you aren't into avant-garde jazz (Ornette Coleman, Archie Shepp, etc.), this is going to sound like so much pounding on instruments. Even when he's doing standards (""This Nearly Was Mine"" and ""Lazy Afternoon"" on this record) they don't fall into any traditional interpretation...they go WAY leftfield, and fans of the avant style wouldn't have it any other way.If, however, you're a fan of smooth jazz or even just traditional jazz (Coltrane, Miles, etc.) this record - nay, MOST of Taylor's records - will drive you out the room. Listen to a friend's first and see if you're into it. This is NOT an impulse purchase."
3,drill review,These drill bits do not perform as advertised on TV. I don't consider them worth the higher price over conventional bits.
2,Run of the mill,"Yes it's a maiden album, yes it's got the classic on it. Does mean it's a must have? Nope. It's kinda bland. If you want a Greatest hits by maiden or a live album save your money and buy LIVE AFTER DEATH a true rock live album! This one...it lacks the energy and effort shown on Live after...and lives up to its name its a ""real dead one"""
2,MAIDEN MUST BE JOKING !,"Call it lust for money, or just a joke, wherever you want, but Maiden really dropped the ball in this CD. I'm a huge fan, always have been, so I keep wondering how they were capable of releasing two unproduced albuns like these, with no special mood in them (contrary to the amazing ""LIve After Death""?. Janick Gers, as always, drops the ball destroying all good Adrian Smith solos. Dickinson is not at his best. The only good thing is that MAiden's repertoire is so good, that you end liking the record a little bit."
2,Could have Been alot better.,"I like the CD because it has a few songs that are not on on ""Live after Death"" But The production is poor...The drums are drownded out you can realy only hear Nicos Snare when he is playing beats.It is like he has no bass drum,You can barley hear the rest of the kit when he does fills.THis was very disapointing to me because Nico is one of my favorite rock drummers...the bass is way to loud as if Harris was trying to say ""watch me play""...and Even Bruce's VOX seem a bit off.Gears Butchers Adrians solos...he just plays too fast.It is just not the same live experence that the great ""Live After Death "" is....but it does have a few tunes that Live After Death does not have...so I guess this CD is worth picking up....I guess :("
1,Horrible production,"This album wouldn't be so bad if it didn't SOUND so bad -- the mix is horrible! Why Steve Harris took over the mixing responsibilites from Martin Birch (the master!) is beyond me. If they could get Birch to re-mix this, it would be better I'm sure. In comparison to ""Live After Death"", which is, in my opinion, one of the best ever live albums, this one is just plain pathetic.In response to an earlier reviewer's comments on this collection missing ""Wasted Years"", I picked up a CD single from this album that featured that as one of the ""B-Sides"", and it was awful. Dickinson's voice had really gone by that point.I love Maiden, but this one really disappointed me. If you want a good live Maiden album, pick up the excellent ""Live After Death""."
3,Good songs... but what a selection of performance!,"If all the songs in this album were the album version, this could've been a great compilation. So, it is a live album... You might say ""Cool"" Then this is the dilemmaHave you gotten the Live after Death album?If your answer is ""NO"" Give it a try... if you dare. If your answer is ""YEs"" Well... You might better want to listen it a lot more.This has a good selection of songs (Well, ARDO has some weird ones like ""Remember tomorrow"") and it could be a big one... if they hadn't released Live after death. Janick Gers makes The evil that men do sound like Be quick or be dead... So, if you respect Adrian Smith... You better stay with Live after death and buy BRAVE NEW WORLD"
2,Lax,"I hate to break it you you, Maiden fans. But, if, by now, you havent heard these cd's before, its really not worth it. I am not a huge fan of Dickinson's vocal abilities. Can I play with madness has a very bad into, the mixing of the live act is very bad and I just think that when Steve Harrie compiled all this music, he must have been on drugs or was drunk beacause he said that these are some of the 'finer' Iron Maiden Moments... well if these are the 'finer' moments.... I wouldnt pay money to see them in a 'bad' moment.........."
1,Confirming bad for data,I had endless problems backing up to Sony CD's. Switched to TDK and almost always works fine. Stay away from Sony CD's.
2,May work for some,They don't work at all in my Lenovo W500 Laptop with Windows XP and Media PLayer 11 - I have wasted 10 or more until I worked out that ....... they work just fine in my wife's Dell 1501 with Windows 7 and Media PLayer 12.I can't explain why; some reviews speculate it is the CD drive.
2,Experienced some defective discs in my pack,"I've been using Maxell CD-Rs for the last few years for burning music and had a nearly 100% success rate.Recently was at a Radio Shack, and they don't stock Maxell and the clerk convinced me to get the Sony CD-R spindle.Did so, to my regret. A significant percentage are defective. Some of the Sony CD-Rs couldn't be ""read"" (as blanks) by my CD-R drive; some seemed to be recording but then skipped during replay; one where the only the first few songs -- but not others -- were recorded; one that seemed to freak out my CD-R drive and cause it not to open until I rebooted the computer. I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in the pack is a CD-R that will cause me to break out in hives.(Just kidding on that last point).But really. Sony has struck out with me on CD-Rs. I'm back to Maxell, for near-100% reliability."
1,You have to be kidding!,"I must admit. I ignored the previous review by Jon in Florida, and went ahead and bought these CD's thinking Sony is a quality company, so they can't ALL be bad. Well, I think I topped his 65% failure rate. The first 8 CD-R's I tried all had errors! I've gone thru hundreds of competing brand CD-R's with maybe 1 or 2 failures. This is ridiculous. I've used cheap CD-R's before, and you pay the price. I would classify these as cheap."
1,Bad CD-r's,"I bought the exact same spindle at office depot, for only 5 dollars (I now know why they were so cheap). I have a 32x burner and tried to burn several at that speed (the cd's are supposed to be 48x compatible) none of them were readable. I had to burn at 4x for any of the cd's to work! I would suggest instead buying Memorex, I've found spindles of 50 cd's for $10 in some stores, and I've never had a single bad cd. I'm surprised by the quality of Sony's cds especially since I've read elsewhere that they are supposed high quality."
1,Successfully burned 3 cds out of a spindle of 50,"This is the second time I've been dumb enough to buy these- both times, I saw an uncluttered surface (no loud logos!) and the sony brand name, and assumed it'd be good quality. Only after my burning software failed again & again, and then my cd drive stopped recognizing any discs at all until rebooting, did I realize that I'd been through this before- with Sony discs, a year ago.I can't imagine what could possibly make these so bad. I've used just about every other kind of discs with no problem. Reading the other reviews here makes me realize it's not just me. It's pretty upsetting that I've wasted $40 or so on these things, for a grand total of maybe 5-10 usable discs."
1,Truly Infuriating...A BAD PRODUCT,"Im not taking this crap, I am taking these back to the store tomorrow. I have burned 5 and only 3 of them even finished burning, the others had skips that were not hard to find. I cant believe how cheap these things are, you can see through them in some places(!) it looks like someone poked pin holes in em, in other places on the CD there are lumps. What the hell does Sony do, dump a little grit into the mix before they make a CD?I bought some Imation brand CDs, they were cheaper and I only got one bad CD out of 50. I know this is not my CD-ROMs fault, it dosent like cheap crap and Im not going to use it. Any decent brand of CD youll not be able to see through them, the surface coat of the Imation CDs is thick and they are durable. These Sony CDs are a worthless product."
1,"Yes, it's true! Sony CD-r's are HORRIBLE!","What everyone's saying is very true. When I had to back up everything on my hard disc, I would only have put 10 small picture files on each disk before I got a disc error message. So I went through 30 of them to back up material that should have fit on 5 discs. This whole time I thought it was some kind of configuration error with my pictures, but now I realize it was the CD-r's that were the problem. This is unbelievable that Sony has such low quality CD-r's--Sony is usually an excellent brand. My whole entertainment center (TV, VCR, TV, etc.) is Sony, and they work great! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Do NOT buy Sony CD-R blank audio disks!,I bought a pack of 10 Sony CD-R 80 minute disks. Only 3 out of 10 worked. Buyer beware.
1,"The price is tempting, but don't buy them...","These are TERRIBLE! I needed a good recording of backing tracks for a college application CD, so I tried these. I went through five--FIVE!--and they all skipped. The files play flawlessly in iTunes, so I know it's the CD. Trust me--they're a frustrating waste of time."
1,stay away,"you may be tempted to buy these because of the 'sony' name...but be warned, DO NOT buy sony cd-r's off of amazon....I bought this same 50 pack, and had to throw half, yes half as in 25 of the discs, out because they had read errors and God knows what else. I find this strange though, because I've bought (and still do) these same sony cd-r's from best buy, and at target, and at staples...and they've always worked fine. I thought I would give it a go buying the online and I'm sorry I did. If you want the sony cd's, just go to your local target and pick em up there...at least I can tell, based off my experience, they'll work. Can't say the same for the ones coming from amazon."
1,Trash.,"Disc after disc, burn after burn, Sony CD-R's just. don't. work.If nothing else, they're consistent.Why doesn't anybody sell trustworthy products anymore?"
1,Sony CD-R Media useless,"So my wife purchased these CD's for me, and they are horrible, after going through over half of the CD's, I came to the conclusion they were all no good. Bought some memorex CD's and I'm up and running now. Do not buy Sony media products."
1,Glad I'm not the only one.,"Honestly, I bought this product because it was cheaper than others, I usually trust Sony, and I liked the look of the CDs. Out of 15 cds, I was able to successfully burn 2. At first I thought it was some of the music I had bought online that was not working properly with the disc, then I worried that it was my computer. I would try to back up files, or create an audio cd and an error sign would pop up, eject the disc, and then the disc would be ruined. I threw away 13 cds! I was relieved to discover that I was not the only one having this problem. These discs are terrible!!! From now on I am strictly a Memorex girl."
1,Pretty worthless...,"After 5 out of 6 burns resulted in errors, I thought that something might be amiss. Sure enough, there was: these discs are worthless. I've never seen anything like this really, especially from a well known electronics company like Sony. Steer way clear."
1,Frisbees or Coasters,"I looked for reviews of these, and found I am not the only one having problems. I have used about 10 so far, and they are generally recording fine in iTunes. The problem is that my car stereo will not read them. The stereo works just fine with other brands of CD-R, but these just spin and spin until I get an error message. Next time, I will go back to the HP CDs and wait until they go on sale."
5,These CD-R's worked great for me.,I use Nero 5.5 and 6 Ultra to burn VCD's with these disks and they have worked great for me. I have not had a single disk-related error and the picture quality is excellent.
1,Don't waste your money,"These CD-Rs are terrible. They have no capacity whatsoever for overburning. I get frequent errors, and I hear the lifespan on these is not very long. Put all these flaws together with my gut feeling that, despite getting a 2-for-1 deal, I'd rather have spent 20 bucks on some Fujis or TDKs which have worked well for me in the past."
1,Had to throw half of them away,I'm not one to enjoy buying a pack of 50 CD's and having to throw half of them away because the drive can no longer read them. They deteriorate quickly.
1,CD-R Audio 80 Failure,These are a waste of money. I kept trying these and thought it was something I was doing wrong. They will not record. Windows Media usually won't burn but does occasionally which gives false hope because they won't play. What a waste of time and energy. No more SONY.
1,Most go in the trash. Bad product.,"I burn a lot of CD's and in the last two years I have had nothing but trouble with the Sony CD-R as well as the CD-R Music. I've exchanged two of the spindles I got thinking I had a bad batch but again, every third disc or less will not burn and needs to go in the trash. They are inexpensive but when you buy 50 and can only use 30 and 20 go in the trash. It's frustrating."
1,Utter Trash,"Big fan of Sony - have a BlueRay/HD system in my home, and I use Sony Vegas Pro as my video editor. These disks are utter trash - MOST of them failed, and even the ones that DIDN'T fail were erroneously burned. I am VERY disappointed with this product."
1,"Had same problem, Not lieing here, Something wrong!","Had same problem, Not lieing here, Something wrong!had the same problem here trying to use these thing and I'm not trying to smare Sony at all. Have had some grate products from the pass andlook forward to new things from them, But these Sony CD-R are no- good. I slow down the speed when copy on them and still getting errors so I don't know what the problem is with them, I use other brands and have copy just find. These have been my home recordings not copyright music, I thought that maybe something to do with it. Maybe are fake brand, I got at a big retailer store here so i don't think they are, If someone know what I need to do to make them work please feel tale me. I cann,t recommend these at all!thxs,,"
1,4 out of 5 failed burns so far.,"I have a memorex dvd+/-r drive, It has worked very well for me with other brands. I will probably end up throwing what I have left of these Sony discs in the trash rather than waste my time trying each one to get a couple of successful burns. Don't buy this."
1,Consistently Bad,Just wanted to chime in and reiterate what everyone is saying ... Sony CD-R's are extremely unreliable!
1,It's a SHOCK.,"I met some problem as other people said.Buy whatever brands just do not buy this Sony brand.Others are cheaper than it, and they won¡t mess your work up.I have never got a horrible blank cd-r.Never ever buy it."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"These cds are GARBAGE. I purchased them, thinking that the $1 difference between these and Memorex wouldn't cause any problems. WRONG. I've gone through HALF THE STACK trying to burn ONE cd. AND i'm using a Sony computer. I've only had about 3 cds turn out ok, with one of them skipping A LOT. Warning to all buyers, stay away."
5,Excellent jazz coordination cookbook,"I recently received this book and I've been working on it for more than a week. It's somehow surprising that this book is not widely known in the drumming community (at least here in Italy).I find this book excellent. It contains many coordination exercises on 1, 2 and 3 voices (all combinations of snare drum, bass drum and hi-hat), both on swung eighths and triplets, against the jazz ride pattern. The exercises are of gradually increasing difficulty so the book would be perfect both for the beginner or the advanced jazz drummer. The review solos at the end of each chapter are musically pleasant."
1,Skip it unless you are a born-again Christian!,"If you're looking for an entertaining Hollywood bio, this ain't it. I guess she covered most of the Hollywood stuff in her earlier book, ""Surviving Myself."" This one is all about the beauty and wonder and glory of being ""saved"" by Jesus, and is laced with passages of scripture. Since I'm completely non-religious, I flipped through it for just a few minutes and gave it back to the library."
