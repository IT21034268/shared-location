5,Diversity at its youngest and best!,I have purchased Debbie Bailey's series of books and given them as gifts at baby showers and birthdays! The parents always report the books are favorites once the tiny readers start turning the pages. Diversity needs to be introduced at young ages and the author really does a great job of helping to accomplish this! Debbie Bailey is my cousin and I am proud that she is a part of our family!
3,Clever and Handy but not Swiss tough,"I received this as a birthday present last year. I really like it, but it has drawbacks. It requires a battery for the light, of course but the battery goes bad in a few months, quicker than I expected. The pen dries out fast, I probably was able to write 10 sticky notes worth with it and it is now retired as a dull letter opener! It opens now instead of writing the letters... (sigh). It proved handy to have a usb memory key with me all the time, and it looks more MacGyver than Revenge of the Nerds, which is a plus. Airlines are familiar with this device too, and they just check to make sure there is no knife and then let it pass. Mine has started to come apart and I'm going to send it back to the store I was told it was purchased. It has only been dropped maybe twice... Overall neat presentation and handy combination of everyday ""work"" tools, but not perfected."
4,interesting for dylan fans,"It is more historically accurate and complete than the Scorcsese docu. in that it mentions Ramblin' Jack and includes a brief Carolyn Hester interview where she talks about Dylan first meeting Hammond at her recording session. Its give a more complete overview, covering up to the year 2000."
1,Dylan rules - A&E stinks!,"Sickening! This was about 90% boring talking heads, 9% still photo's of Hibbing, Minnesota, and 1% Dylan footage. More Dylan, less fillin'!"
2,Dylan - A genius seen through rose tinted glasses,"Although there is no doubting Dylan's genius this video, views him through an uncritical elevated to God status. A few nice clips but the world is still waiting for the definitive Dylan biography. Suppose we will have to wait until he dies."
3,A Nat King Cole Sound-alike!,"If you are looking for the same mature, and yet more spontaneous and soulful style of singing found in Hit The Road Jack, I Can't Stop Loving You (from the Atlantic years), you will be disappointed by this boxset. One can easily fool someone by playing some of the tracks from this boxset and not disclosing the name of the singer, and the person will unmistakenly name the singer as Nat King Cole. But for fans of Ray Charles, this box is good to have because the price is good and it collects 45 tracks of early works."
5,"Some Duplicated Info, Some Fresh","I just read this book after reading Zen and the Rat of the internet. There appears to be some information duplicated in both books. Also there are some far out errors, the one I noticed first was the quote by ""Irish Murdoch""! I think the book could have used an editorial pass.The really fresh and worthwhile stuff was the case studies and how to make it work in the real world. It was almost like one author did ""internet"" stuff and one did children stuff, and the children stuff was much more polished. I wonder if maybe the co-author Victoria Mixon did the kids stuff since it wasn't also in the Zen book. I can't find any other books by her though, I wish she would write some.This is a good book for getting teachers (and kids!) on the internet though!"
1,Lifelong Elvis Fan Abandons Hero Over Career-Worst Album,"This is a major disappointment. I would rather listen to fingernails running down a chalkboard than hear this entire album (I cannot make it past the first 4 songs). Not only is this clearly the worst album he has ever put out, this may be among the worst albums I have ever heard. All this from the man who started his career by awakening us just when we thought rock was dead. After listening to this (or as much as I could stomach), now I am beginning to believe it is."
1,STAY AWAY,"Tripe, drivel, limp, and uninspired. I could not beleive my ears. Elvis, what happened? Where were you? Did I mention flat, boring, drippy, and annoying. For new Elvis fans, please do not let this be your first impression--normally, the man is very inspired/inspirational. Sorry Elvis, I made the record store take it back and apologize."
2,This is a horrible CD. I actually give it 2 stars,"because I can tell that the performances are pretty good, and a lot of work went into it. But, the tunes are downright dog-wailing-at-night awful, sorry to say. Let me also say that I'm not afraid of some sappy songs. Burt Bacharach has made some really nice tuneful songs in his day, as has Costello. What they've done here is nothing short of astonishing, but not in the positive sense.I fully expected something along the lines of Costello's version of ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"". But what this CD provides you with is dentist office music. My secretary laughed out loud when she heard me trying to make it through this CD in my office.Word to the wise. If you love feeling like you're about to get your teeth worked on, this is the CD for you."
1,Please stop recording this mellow stuff,"A younger critic can provide a very unique perspective on Elvis's music and offer some important criticism...so listen up. I loved his earlier records. The upbeat sounds of ""Peace, Love, and Understandind,"" ""Watching The Detectives,"" and ""Accidents will happen"" rocked, period. But this new, mellow stuff with him and Burt Whoever is annoying to listen to. I used to think his music reflected a fun, 80's feeling, but now it just seems to be a droning, boring sound. I'm not sure how exactly to sum up what I'm saying...when I used to listen to his music, I felt like he had captured a feeling I could completely relate to, but now I feel isolated from whatever feeling or message he is trying to convey with his music. If you have other thoughts, feel free to tell me. But THIS IS HOW THE YOUNGER GENERATION (TEENS) FEELS. but hey, who cares bout us anyway, right?"
4,A masterpiece,"Simply, the best combination between music and feelings that you can achieve in 12 songs. I have been listening to it for three years and I don't get tired at all. Superb, a contemporary classic, a wonderful and inspired creation. Bill Frisell's versions ""The sweetest punch"" also deserves a try."
2,A near miss ...,"two plus two does not equal five ... two great musical talents don't quite complement each other. It's nearly a classic, but somehow Elvis' voice does not suit this. I like Elvis when he sings slow songs, but this is just out of his range. However, so few artists would give themselves the challenge - on that note, you have to say, ""Hat's off"" to EC - but I'd rather hear these songs by Dionne Warwick."
2,Oil and water don't mix well - if at all,"Burt Bacharach's silky strings and lush orchestral arrangements clash with Costello's creaky voice. The critics love it but I suspect the Bacharach fans would rather have Dionne Warwick or Andy Williams singing, and the Costello fans will hate the strings and heavenly choirs. A real oddity."
5,This is a masterpeice! Brought me to tears.,"I am sitting here listening to ""painted by memory"" and I am really torn up. This recording has brought me to tears. For anyone who has loved or has been in love knows how the heart can speak. Anyone who knows what it is like to feel heart broken will understand too. What else can I say. If you are lucky enough to get a profound feeling from this album, I am glad you did! I am crying like a baby. This is one of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. I suppose it has spoken to me at a time when I needed it most. It has pulled at my heart strings. Such longing...this album will stay with me for a long time..."
2,"Fussy, overcomplicated, and poorly sung","Elvis Costello saved my life when he burst on the music scene in 1977, but he's been mostly irrelevant for years. While this record seems to be making a lot of his fans happy, I fail to see why. The songs on this record feel like forced genre exercises. The melodies are far too fussy; despite their harmonic complexities, they lack little things like hooks. (This *is* supposed to be a pop record, right?) The lyrics are overbaked as well. Worst of all is how poorly Costello's voice fits the material. A good singer (Marti Jones for instance) could make you overlook the flaws in the material; Costello only calls attention to them."
5,Simply Superb,"A stupendous collaboration between Costello and Bacharach. The haunting lyrics serve as the foundation for this album, but the piano work, along with input from Johnny Mandel will stand forever as a masterpiece in my extensive CD collection. Caution must be used when listening to this album however. Quite simply, its practically a cantata about the malingering effects of unrequited love. Damn music made me start smoking again.....great album, really. Goes well with multiple shots of Bourbon."
3,"Pretty good, not great","I don't understand why Elvis Costello is singing here. His voice is pinched and strained on this album, and while that may work on his rock albums, it really hurts these tracks. The tunes are often quite athletic, and it's almost painful to listen to him struggle with them.The songwriting itself is pretty good, though I suspect their next effort will be a little more relaxed and successful. A lot of pretty stuff, but the melodies can get awfully long and snakey, so don't expect to really get into any of these songs until you've heard them half a dozen times. After that, though, expect to not be able to get them out of your head."
2,"Lettuce, Tomato and Extra Schmaltz, Please","After enjoying the collaboration between Elvis and Burt for the Grace of My Heart soundtrack,I expected something pretty special from this cd. Instead, it sounds as if everyone did their recording in a different country, weeks apart. Elvis mumbles from somewhere out back while the piano tinkles on remorselessly, and every now and then a braying reincarnation of the Ray Conniff singers bursts into, I guess, song, without any emotion whatsoever. A serious disappointment."
1,Elvis' ALL TIME WORST!,In a career that outshines all the pretenders our prolific Elvis has had more than his share of clunkers. Before you is the bottom of the barrel. His ability to stretch and defy categories is admirable. Unfortunately too often he's way past his limits! Truly horrible!
3,5 Stars for Burt 1 Star for Costello,Awwwww.if only someone else were singing these songs. If only someone else.......
1,2 fab tracks accompanied by 10 non-tunes,"The 2 fab tracks are THE SWEETEST PUNCH and TOLEDO. The rest is utter crap. And it's Bacharach's fault since he's the only one with any talent anyway. Costello continues to wring his precious song-lyric metaphors for all they're worth. Check out the ultra-emetic MY THIEF (or better yet, don't) with its precious girl-singer mewling about a ""perfect alibi"". It made me wanna fwow up all over Elvis's collection of cutesy-poo hats."
4,Amazing,"Elvis Costello has chosen many different artists to help him create records. Among these people is Sir Paul McCartney. However, Burt Bacharach has proven to be Costello's most unlikely, yet successful collaborator to date. PAINTED FROM ME MEMORY is a definite change for Elvis Costello as all of the songs are either slow or mid-tempo. Bacharach has helped write some of the most beautiful ballads written during the nineties. The whole album flows like a picture ""painted from memory."" From the powerful title track to the playful ""Toledo,"" Costello's voice is always the main attraction. This was one of the most unexpected records, but who cares? Hopefully this new team will continue making records together."
4,Never Thought It Would Work,"I almost hate to admit it, but I really like this CD. I'm more of an Elvis Costello fan and not really much of a Bacharach fan, but the more I listen to this album the more it grows on me. The tunes are catchy and EC is his usual fine self. He's not in top voice on every track, but when he does hit it he's dead on. The one thing is, it's very hard to listen to this album repeatedly. However, it's great for listening to when you need something to distract you."
4,"Give Burt and Ernie (er, ELVIS) a chance","Reading the reviews of 'Painted from Memory' makes for an interesting afternoon. As I continue my journey through the Elvis Costello catalogue, I thought I'd toss in my two cents. As someone who thought I was only a fan of his early rock recordings (Aim, Model & Armed Forces), I'm pleasantly surprised to find that I very much enjoy Costello's later forays into other genres.I initially agreed with comments here that Elvis's voice doesn't seem suited for the material. However, I quickly did a 180 on that. I don't know that I can explain it, but somehow his plaintive caterwauling here is compelling in a way that the dulcet crooning of a Michael Buble would not be.Consistency in quality is a hallmark of 'Painted from Memory'. There are not just a couple of stand-out cuts; the entire recording is solid. Everyone who takes the time to sample this unusual offering from Costello and Bacharach will have their own favorites."
2,Strangely uninvolving,"This CD can't help but be pleasant, but unfortunately, that's all it is. The songs just float out there and are completely uninvolving. What sounds like an intriguing pairing of artists turns into a huge question mark: Why didn't this turn out better? This album has been wildly overpraised; find some ""real"" Elvis instead."
2,Come on Elvis!,"I've been a faithful EC fan since I saw him on SNL in about 1979 or so, and went out the next day and bought the just-released ""My Aim is True."" I think ""Get Happy!"", ""King of America,"" and some others are among the best rock/pop lps ever recorded. But I just can't take this Burt Bacharach business. These songs are so pitiful and insipid they make me sick. I try to give it the benefit of the doubt cause it is EC, but I just can't get with this thing. Come on Elvis, remember you're the angry boy, not some mushy trod-on wimp begging his lover to come back and whip him one more time!"
2,Another 1 Hit CD,"I've tried to listen to this CD on a daily basis hoping it would grow on me, but nothing sprouted. I am a big fan of Burt Bacharach's music but I'm afraid his well has gone dry. The only memorable, outstanding song on this CD is the last one. God Give Me Stength is brilliant! Typical Bacharach melody with great lyrics by Costello. All the other tunes seem to fade away from my memory. Bacharach has a gift for writing catchy melodies, but there's nothing catchy about this collection. I wish I could say something more positive about it, but compared to so much of Bacharach's excellent work in the past, this CD is a big disappointment."
5,"ELVIS'S SINGS BURT'S MUSIC LIKE NO ONE HAS, FANTASTIC!","AS A LONG TIME BACHARACH FAN, MY FAVORITE BACHARACH SONGS ARE HIS INSTRUMENTALS, BUT MORESO THE ONE'S HE HAS SUNG. HIS VOICE IS LESS THAN PERFECT, BUT JUST FITS HIS MUSIC SO WELL. ELVIS COSTELLO'S VOICE IS VERY SIMILAR TO BURT'S VOICE, BUT BETTER. NOTHING HAS COMPLIMENTED HIS MUSIC MORE. I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ALBUM, AS I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BIG ELVIS COSTELLO FAN, BUT EACH OF THESE SONGS GET BETTER EACH TIME YOU LISTEN TO THEM. BOUGHT IT TWO WEEKS AGO, AND HAVE LISTENED TO NOTHING ELSE. CLASSIC BACHARACH MUSIC SO CLOSE TO WHAT HE WAS WRITING BACK IN THE 60'S AND 70'S. CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS ALBUM, CAN ONLY HOPE FOR ANOTHER RELEASE FROM THESE TWO SOMETIME SOON."
5,A gift for the broken-hearted!,"Bacharach is back! And he's perfect for Elvis' tender voice. The songs on this album are the saddest ever written. This CD and some cocktails will have you sobbing your eyes out if you've got a broken heart. I had to hide it from myself, it's just too powerful. God give me strength. Thank you Burt and Elvis. What the world needs now is more real music like this. Timeless, tortured and beautiful. Just like Christina."
4,very nice,"when I first got this CD, I played it for two weeks straight (I'm sure my wife was sick of that..).The combination of Costello & Bacharach really works.My only issue is that it can be a little melancholy at times.other than that its a good addition to the collection."
5,Wow... it feels good!,"Burt and Elvis have combined strengths to provide a smooth ride through melodic twists with jazz back-beats. Songs like ""Such Unlikely Lovers"" has you dancing while Elvis twists the melody with his voice as instrument. I can't even talk about ""God Give Me Strength"" it is a stopper. ""Toledo"" reminds me of a Donald Fagan ride--clever lyrics on top of amazingly hooked music.I have followed Elvis through his career and loved every step. This album deserves a place next to ""This Year's Model"", ""Armed Forces"", ""The Juliet Letters"", and even ""Brutal Youth.""The reviews from a few who call this whiney, out of touch... they are simply myopic meanderings from the musically mundane!Trust me, this album will have you singing, swaying, and dancing through each repeated listen."
5,Album of the year. No doubt.,"Absolutely brilliant songwriting. The arrangements are classic Bacharach and the lyrics are inspired Costello. In the future someone will probably re-record this CD and substitute Elvis' voice with a Dionne Warwick/Luther Vandross impersonator and it will be a huge hit with the public. Popular taste will usually gravitate towards a sweet, milk chocolate essence. But I will always prefer Elvis' plaintive, tortured voice. This album is pure bittersweet chocolate for my melancholy soul."
5,"Timeless, perfect popular music","I just wanted to add my voice to the throng - this is my favourite album of the year by far and no superlatives are high enough for it. Don't worry about Costello's voice - it's the sharp knife that cuts through Bacharach's butter, and the combination is incandescent - with simply far more verve than the more mellifluous recordings of Bacharach's earlier work (much as I love them). The songs are perfectly crafted popular pieces with all the subtle musical complexity you expect from Bacharach, plus the heartrending emotion in Costello's lyrics; it's hard to believe there are many new themes in love songs, but he's found twelve! The album has barely been promoted - there is simply no airplay for this kind of material - but will have long, long legs. Enjoy!"
3,an interesting effort,"A lot of people who write about this Bacharach-Costello collaboration obviously don't know this: Elvis was singing Bacharach in 1977 already. Go listen to ""Live Stiffs"", and then come back and talk when your homework is done okay? Jeez.Yes, as one complainer said, the songs do meander. They are not terribly hummable. Most Bacharach songs aren't. Neither is Mahler. But this isn't a valid objection. It didn't promise ""hummability"" on the label. Moving on...Wonderful ""hyper-romantic"" lyrics. But, as receptive as I have slowly become to this album (lifelong EC fanatic), I still don't like ""crooner Elvis"". I don't think that this is the music his voice was meant to sing."
4,Wonderful,I was unaware of this collaboration however once I stumbed upon it I became intriqued. Burt Bacharach's formula for beautiful music makes him a timeless producer along with Mr. Costello's writing makes this CD more enjoyable with each listen.
2,Where is Hal David when you need him?,"I first heard of this CD on an National Public Radio interview. It sounded like it had great potential, which unfortunately it did not live up to.While some of the music is interesting and Mr.Costello does an OK job, the lyrics are just plain awful."
4,funny irish low-level thugs,"a good straightforward, funny, low-budget, crime buddy-movie comedy. it's about a kid who comes out of prison and gets into a mess, and then another one. not for kids -- the title's intended as a double-entendre. but it's sweet and funny. brendan gleeson is great."
5,Excellent tale of getting a second chance,"Amazing picture, with many beautiful shots. I enjoyed the film, feeling very complete as a movie-goer upon leaving the theatre."
5,The beauty of simplicity,What a fantastic book! Congratulations National Geographic. The best I've seen in cats. Highly recommended.
3,A sense of disappointment,"As a collector of cat books, I had anticipated ""National Geographic Cat Shots"" being something special, especially with the quality of the cover photograph. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Although a good collection of photos, I felt that they didn't reflect the true nature and character of the cat."
4,We love this highchair...,"I was very sceptical of purchasing this chair after reading so many mixed reviews - I am so glad we got it. It is super easy to put together and is very sturdy. My daughter (9 months) can pull up on it if she's crawling around and I don't have to worry about it turning over on her. The highchair is a nice size and doesn't take up too much room. The spot underneath the chair is great for bibs, wipes, etc. It has definately met the needs of our family (and will for a while, she has plenty of growing room)."
3,Love it and hate it,"I love this chair because the look of it. It's nice and simple and matches with the rest of our furniture nicely. As to be expected with any furniture that is solid wood, it's very heavy so moving it from one space to another is not easy. I hate the cover on this chair though! It is constantly moving about and the velcro sides do not stick at all so the cover is constantly trying to come off - every time I take my daughter out of it, in fact. I am not thrilled with the straps, either, but I can live with them."
4,It's like a piece of furniture,I really like the way the high chair looks...it blends in with our furniture instead of sticking out like the plastic models do. I love the plastic top though...it's so easy to wipe off and keep clean. I just wish that it could recline. I've discovered that it's difficult for our 7 month old to sit up that straight and it would be nice if we could recline it a bit. Nevertheless I think I would recommend the product.
4,Great High Chair,"I really like the Eddie Bauer High Chair. It goes wonderfully with my decor and when you walk into the room, you don't even notice it. It is really easy to clean and the cup holders that pull out of the tray are terrific. The only thing I would change is the safety buckle. My daughter always sits right on it and I have to manuever her around to get at the buckle. Otherwise it is fantastic."
2,Pros and Cons....,"We received this highchair as a gift, had we paid the money for it, I'd be upset.Pros - it looks beautiful and it is very sturdy.Cons - the straps are THE WORST, we struggle each and every time we put our baby in (she's 13 months now) and like others said, it is VERY hard to clean the seat. It was fine when she was younger and we fed her purees neatly with a spoon, but now that she is self feeding its a mess. Food gets trapped on the pad, under the pad, in between the wood slats...its a project to clean after each feeding.Granted, I don't have anything to compare this chair to, but I have to assume there are better chairs out there, not as pretty maybe, but more functional. I would not buy this chair."
5,Excellent choice!,"I originally wanted to purchase another high chair, but when I did some research I found that it was not generally favored. After some investigation I came across the Eddie Bauer chair and decided to purchase it. I could not be happier. It is sturdy, good quality and comes in some great prints. You may pay a little more but it's absolutely worth it. I definitely recommend this high chair."
1,not for young babies,"As first time parents, we didn't really know what to look for in a high chair. This high chair is very pretty, but not very functional. It doesn't lean back. Unless your child is already sitting on his own this is not the chair for you. Also-NONE of the suction cup toys will stick to the tray. We are looking to buy a better chair."
3,"I love it, but it has it's downfalls","This high chair is one of the most beautiful chairs out there, but it is kind of impractical. I didn't put my son in it till he could sit up because I had a booster seat that reclined that he used. It is heavy, so its hard to move, and if you don't clean it right after it's used, it gets cruddy. Tray is big enough, I've never had a problem with that, but the removable part of the tray is useless. Once they know how to get it off, it doesn't stay on. The padding does get worn after many washings, but now my son is 2, so I'm not really suprised. It stays at one hight, so now that my son wants to sit like a big boy with his big brother and sister, he gets frustrated at dinner time (for lunch and breakfast he sits at the table because his daddy's at work). So really its not worth the $100 for less than 2 years of use when you can problably get more use out of a cheaper, adjustable chair."
1,This Chair is the worst chair ever,"I was encouraged to buy this chair because my sister in law told me that I would get sick of looking at a colorful highchair and the wooden one would look great in my kitchen. She also told me that I would never need a chair that reclines. Well, my 5 month old has been eating solids for a month now and I still feed him in the bouncy chair. This chair does not recline, so he tends to slouch and and gets food every where. Since you can't just wipe the cusion down, I have to wash it. I'm selling this crappy chair and getting a funtional chair that reclines, wipes clean and has adjustable hieght."
1,Not Functional,"I bought this chair as a first time mom and not thinking about the time i would have to get things done. This chair once you start feeding your child solid foods is a waste of time. If your child is like any other infant the food does not stay in their mouths but goes everywhere else including the seat cover. So that means you have to either vacuum the seat, take it off and shake it out or if its really dirty you have to wash it. That means you then have to dry it. WHO HAS THE TIME!!!! not me. I can not recommend this seat to anyone. if i still had the box i would be taking it back.Also, when you first start using the chair your child is not ready to sit upright right away. this chair does not give you the ability to recline at all. we constantly had to adjust our daughter so that she would be sitting upright and not falling to either side. doesn't make for a happy and enjoyable feeding."
1,Bad Condition,"This High Chair was a gift, when they opened the box it was scratched, dented and not packed well at all. My friends had to return it to the origional store and get another one. This was VERY inconvient especially since she was 9 months pregnent. I was Not happy at all..."
3,Not so safe,"This chair is very pretty and sturdy, but we have had a lot of problems with the straps. My active small 10 month old has been able to stand up and turn around in the chair for 2 months, despite being strapped in and having the tray pushed all the way in. We had to remove the pad (which had been shrunk beyond use anyway. The new wipe-clean one looks much more practical) and lash the straps to the chair slats to keep it safe enough for my daughter. Also it really is hard to clean, with lots of nooks and crannies to store up food bits."
2,"The chair looks great, but very hard to clean.","I really like how the chair looks, that it's narrow, that the tray that can be put in the dishwasher, and the little compartment in the back that we put bibs in. But it's Horrible to clean! You can use the cover and you'll have to wash it every time it's used if you have a messy toddler like I do. Or you can take the cover off but food sticks really bad to the wood and after scrubbing the wood so much it starts to fade and look bad. I would prefer the high chair come with a plastic pad so it can be wiped down easily. If I could do it over again I would NOT buy this high chair."
3,Beautiful chair but not very good straps,"I loved my chair. It matched my house and it look so nice with my other furniture. I didn't want one of those high chairs that are so bright and colorful that it is the first thing people see when they enter your house, that's why I got this chair.It was great for the first year, until my son started to want to stand in it. Even with the straps as tight as possible withoutcutting off my son's circulation he could still get out of it without much effort. He then just stands there.The straps are made different than other chairs. Instead of there being a strap in the front and one that comes around, they are all connected. You have to pull the strap underneath the child and then wrap the sides around. I believe setup is why my son can get out so easily.Next time I will look at all aspects of a high chair before I buy. Looks aren't everything."
1,Waste of Money Highchair,"This highchair is absolutely horrible. I registered for it because of its looks, and Oh, boy...bad, bad, move. It doesn't recline, the space where the baby sits is too small and can't be adjusted! If your baby grows and still needs to sit in it, forget it. His knees will get stuck. It's a hassle to move it from place to place and it's got the worse buckles ever. I ended up buying The First Years Reclining 4 Stages Feeding Seat, which I highly recommend. It doesn't take up space in your kitchen because it is strapped onto a regular chair and it has the same functions as any highchair. Best invention ever. Big frustration this Eddie Bauer Monstruous Thing. Trust me, please: Don't buy it!"
4,Eddie Bauer wooden highchair,"We love this chair. It's very easy to clean. The chair pad is removable and washes great. It has little swing out bowl holders on the tray table which come in handy as well. We had no trouble assembling the highchair and it is very sturdy. No, it does not recline, but we never found that to be a problem. I would buy this chair again if given the chance."
2,Honda Accord manual,"I purchased this manual to gain insite into issues I have with my car's navigation system. The topic is not mentioned in this book. As a matter of fact, the identification or location of the elements that make up the system is not covered by the book at all. As I suspect the problem is a matter of interconnections, this most easy and trivial presentation of this information is lacking, making the book useless for my immediate needs."
3,"Poor quality, average coverage","Purchased this for my Wife's car. It covers the basics adequately, though the print quality is poor making the photos difficult to make out. It doesn't cover much beyond the basics, and is a poor comparison to the manufacturer's manuals I've picked up for other Honda vehicles."
2,Honda Accord Repair Manual 2003-2005 (Haynes Automotive Repair Manual),"I think the book itself would be quite good except that the photos in the book are of very poor quality.Some photos are superb, giving the reader easy visual understanding.There are however many many photos that are so poor (washed out in the ink and lacking definition) that it leaves the reader very confused with the written dialogue. I think part of the problem is the poor quality of the paper in the repair manual.There seems to have been a printing malfunction during production.Amazon's service on the other hand was superb as always. Thank you."
2,poor photos,Like the other reviewers I found the photos in this manual unacceptable. First the paper it's printed on is some horrible recycled junk that is only fit for text. Second the black and white photos (all are B&W) almost all have poor lighting and contrast. They may have looked good on the computer when they were editing it but by the time they were printed cheaply on cheap paper they are completely unacceptable. There also aren't enough photos in some cases. They show you a close up of something but you have no idea what general region the item is located.
2,Too much jumping around in this manual,I bought this book to do the cv shafts on my wifes Accord and had to look at about four different chapters to see exactly what I needed to do. I am experienced in working on my vehicles and consider myself to be mechanically inclined. I didnt like having to look through the book and I have used better manuals. I agree that the pics could be way better
4,Nice piece of Nokia,"This item works quite well. Especially when connected to an original i.e. Nokia phone(6310i), but I also connected to a Siemens S-55 with good results. No problems so far, just nice and clear sound. And remember the excellent battery life time;-)As other pepople have mentioned; I understand that it doesn't fit on any ear, but it is worth trying it. It took me some time to figure out how to fit on the ear....- I never imagined it could be that difficult getting dressed;-)Final benefit: It came with a nice battery charger that also fits the phone! GOOD!"
1,Worked for 32 days.,"I purchased this headset from a local retail store. I was very impressed at its clarity, comfort, and ease of use...Then it went completely dead after 32 days, just in time to overlap the 30 day return policy from the store. I then mailed it to Nokia for repair. Everytime I call, they say they cannot find my records and put me on hold for 30 minutes before finding it. It has now been 8 months and Nokia has given me the run around last stating that they would send me a check for the amount of the now discontinued bluetooth headset. Let's just say, I am still waiting. In conclusion, Nokia has really bad customer support. Out of principle, I will never buy a Nokia product again."
3,HS-11w good as long as the battery lasts,"I have everything good to say about using this bluetooth headset. It pairs easy, long standby and long talk time. Conversations are clear, and as full of fedelity available from a telephone. It is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, but take good care not to lose it. For talk quality, you will be pleased.What you need to know is this headset and many others have batteries that cannot be replaced. I purchased October 5, 2005, and November 9, 2006 gave me a dead battery. It made a year and 4 weeks. To compare, 2 Motorola H500 made 3 years. I was disappointed to trash a good functioning headset since it too cannot replace the battery. I intentionally went to the higher priced Nokia, only to learn a year later it was a poor choice.Next up, look for a review of every bluetooth headset with a replaceable battery."
2,Unreliable headset,"I purchased my nokia headset less than a year ago and it just died today. Despite all its flaws I rather liked it but the unreliable nature of nokia's products is very annoying.Like- long battery life- comfortable fit, never falls off.- easy controlsDont like- Drops connection every now and then- Sometimes calls would be garbled and require a ""reboot"" of the headset- Unreliable. Died after 9 months.- Nokia's warranty is slow and unfriendly- Only supports Bluetooth 1.1Once you start using bluetooth, you will never want to place another handset to your ear. Unfortunately, most bluetooth headsets have problems with call quality, connection or fit. I guess its time to start looking at devices that support the new Bluetooth 2.0. Looking back at the time I used the HS-11W my feelings are mixed. Did I like using it? Yes. Could it be better ? Very much yes."
5,Very pleased with the performance,"I paired this unit with my Motorola RAZR V3 from Verizon. It works flawless. Prior to this unit, I had a Jabra 250 V (broke down after a few weeks)and a Motorola HS850 head set (returned after users on the other end complained a static and/or poor sound). This unit comfortably wraps around my ears and stays on there. Only thing I wish it had is longer battery life (Nokia claims 6 hours) compared to other units sold in the market. But on the plus side the unit will flash a red light when the battery is low. This is a big plus for me since most bluetooth devices sold in the market do not have a low battery warning."
4,Excellent!,"I originally purchased this headset in 2006 after trying many different styles. I cannot stand to have anything in my ears; therefore earbuds are out of the question. The problem with most ""non-earbud"" styles are that they fall off your ear, or do not hold securely to your ear to hear your call. This unit is a great compromise. The only thing negative I can say about it is that it can become uncomfortable if worn constantly, all day. I have had reasonable luck with tilting it to a different position on the ear to reduce the possibility of soreness. I mistakenly loaned it to my now ex-husband and it was lost for about 3 years. I just moved and while unpacking found it in a former junk drawer. I was able to find a compatible charger and had to figure out how to pair it to my brand new phone, but have not had any problems since. I would definitely purchase another one."
3,"Comfortable, sound not great","This is an extremely comfortable headset, and very light. It doesn't come off, even if you jump around a lot.You can hear the other party OK, but they don't hear you well. It sounds like you're in a box, and there's no higher-frequency sound.I also have Plantronics M3000, which sounds much better, but falls off if you move too much, is heavy, and has a brittle external casing."
3,nice but uncomfortable,Got this headset for 2 days now... everything seems fine but it is so damn uncomfortable... your ears would start to feel sore and look red at approximately 1 hour and you have to take it off or switch it to the other ear. I hope this is just an adjustment period and hopefully my ears would get used to it eventually. It is also not easy to put the headset on the ear.. had a hard time on that one too. voice quality and easeness to connect to the phone is a breeze though.
3,"Not great, not terrible","I bought this based on the strong reviews here on Amazon. It works with my Treo 650, but it's not very comfortable (at least for me), and some of the people I speak with say it sounds terrible. Another complaint is that the charger makes all sorts of high pitched noises when it's charging. Strange, and distracting. I'm looking for something else..."
4,Very comfortable!,"You hardly know your wearing it and although the buttons are small, they are easy to manipulate. This works well with my Nokia 6600 phone."
3,"Nice, but has some problems","This headset has some really nice features. It fits comfortably in either ear and its quite easy to operate. Volume level and clarity are decent, although not enough for noisy environments. It fits comfortably with eyeglasses. However, I found that mine becomes ""garbled"" once in a while, as if it had become slightly mistuned from the phone, and then you have to fumble to transfer the call to the phone or just disconnect. That can be quite frustrating if you're in the middle of an important call!Otherwise, its clean, simple design and good value makes it a good option to consider."
3,not the best game,"this game is pretty lousy. its kinda fun but its boring its a short game and no offence to people who bought it, but you should have rented it first. the people who think that the game is boring and so is the movie your wrong the movie is waaay better."
1,CRAP,I was playing it on my protble dvd player on a trip to washinton D.C we beet it in 40 minuits.It sucks and the controols stink and the them is childish nothing like the relly good movie with Jhonny Deep.
2,Frustrating,"We found the controls and graphics of this game very frustrating, from camera angles to getting stuck on objects. My 9-year-old is determined to finish it but she doesn't seem to be enjoying it anymore - often can't find the way to the next level when one is completed, and personally it gives me a headache to even watch it; I can't play it to help her anymore, it flickers so much. Good potential but needed refining."
3,Waste of Money for Tough Winters,"I purchased this product prepared to tough Wisconsin winters with my son for the first time. This product was reviewed as the best, but turned out to be a great disappointment. We put it on our son's carseat. It was easy to set on there, and easy to zip up and around. Our biggest problem was that it did not provide any warmth for my son. The hole is too large and the material is too thin. On even a mildly windy day, my son's face and body would freeze. I would have to put two to three extra blankets and a hat and mittens in there every single time I would bring him out. Now, it's cold here, but it's not the Arctic! I think the JJ Cole cover would have been a better purchase, and will do that for my future children. Trust me, if it's colder than 30 degrees in your town, please don't waste your money. Get the JJ Cole one and you won't regret it."
5,Excellent.,"Keeps baby quite warm, and yes it does fit over a graco carseat. Nice looking too. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Very nice item,"I bought this for my grandson. We live in very cold central New York and my daughter loves this. The only thing she said is if you are going to be outside for any length of time you need to put a blanket under the baby. They went to a Christmas parade and when they got home she noticed the baby's backside was cold. Otherwise, it is great for in and out of the car, to the store, etc. She uses it all the time for that purpose but does put a blanket under the baby if they are going to be outside for any length of time and it is very cold out."
5,Love it!,"This is an awesome product! I had the other type of carrier cover and took it back to get this type. I prefer this one because it goes over the top not between the seat. Also, it covers the head leaving the opening for the face...No more bundling them up, just buckle up, zip up and go!"
4,Great for keeping baby warm!,"This is a great product. I get a lot of compliments on it as well. Baby stays so warm that I can't even keep a blanket on him. I gave it 4 stars because snow falls on the baby's face because the hole does not cover up. But, I would purchase it again as is. The pocket is handy also."
5,poshpouch carrier cover,"Excellelnt product.. Helps not only with the weather, but permits child restraints to be used properly because they are UNDER the cover. Purchased as a gift and the new mom loves it."
2,Old batteries ready to expire,"While I love Duracell Powerpix batteries for my camera, the batteries sent by this seller have less than 6 months left before their ""best by"" date. I ordered 2 8-packs of batteries in August 2011 and the Grady's Online seller sent me beaten up battery packages with a ""best by"" date of 2012.Given their relatively low cost I'll keep them to avoid the hassle of returning them, but current Amazon buyers should ignore the previously posted positive reviews and beware..."
5,"lightweight, packable",This travel cart is great for minimalist traveling. My wife and I each have one paired with a MEI Voyager [...]The cart folds up and ties on under the compression straps when using it as a backpack and quickly snaps out for use in airports and train stations.. It even fits inside the pack if we are packing light enough.
3,so so luggage cart,"This cart is made of durable plastic, so it is light but a bit more flexible than I would have expected. It held 75 lb packages a few hundred yards into a trade show, which is all I needed, but I do not expect it to be very durable over time. I think there are metal carts out there for the same price that are better value."
4,handy sturdy cart,"So far, I'm pretty satisfied with this product. It's light and easy to fold up for placement in carry-on baggage, yet durable enough to support several pieces of luggage. The handle can be pulled out to a length that is comfortable for someone of above-average height and arm span. It's held up even when items have accidentally been pulled off the base."
3,an okay book,"Having read Alexander Key's ""The Forgotten Door"" as a kid & many times since then I thought it would be fun to re-read another of his books. ""The Case of the Vanishing Boy"" is reminded me in a lot of ways of ""The Forgotten Door"" it was as if Mr. Key took the core of the book and expanded it into a different story. It's a fun book to read and I recommend it."
1,This video sucked.,This is an early episode from Mmpr.I liked power rangers when they were ninjas and zeo. It was okay then but not this video.Its about a food festival at Angel Grove that turns into a food fight.Its a big mess plus Rita Repulsa has created a pig monster that eats eveything!Plus this video is to focus around the blue ranger Billy but what did he do outstanding in this video? You tell me?
4,shirts,"I am very happy with the shirts. It did take longer than I expected to receive them, but I am happy with them. I just wish they had these same shirts in women's sizes, because they are just a little to big for me, but with a little alterations, I made them useful."
2,AVOID THIS CD - music fan from Australia,"One of the poorest mastering jobs I have heard and surely one of the worst cover designs ever. Whoever did the mastering obviously had no idea how Larry's great Specialty records sounded. Unfortunately this CD was issued before Billy Vera became involved with the reissue program of Specialty material. The sound is strangely 'muddy' and way too compressed, which gives the tracks a tunnel echo effect which simply isn't on the original tapes. If you want to hear Larry Williams how he should be heard in crystal clear sound, invest your cash in the UK Ace CD ""The Bad Boy Of Rock'n'Roll"" (CDCHD 709) or better still, chase up the 47 track 2CD set on Ace - ""Larry Williams At His Finest"" (CDCHD2 1021). They are both streets ahead of this rubbish."
2,average,"while I think that El Debarge is a Great Talent&He has covered Marvin Gaye Before especially on ""After the dance"" this is lite&Never fully hits."
4,simply alice,simply alice is an excellent book. i think this because phyliss renyolds really describes alice as someone you can relate to as a teenager. she makes her go through the trials and tribulations that everyone goes through as a teenager. i mean she breaks up with her boyfriend her friends and herself grow apart and she is really upset. she goes from thinking her life is total havick and to loving her life more than everything. she has mood swings and experiances a ton of things. i rate this author the best book i have read all year. 2003/2004
5,Wonderful Alice Again!,"A terrific Alice book! All of Naylor's books are awesome. In simply Alice, it seems like you are part of the story. It's every teen girl's biography! Keep up the good work Phyllis!"
1,Maury Povich in book form,"These books are so amazingly trashy. I can't imagine any decent parent approving of these books. It's no wonder our society is degrading so quickly, when girls have decided to become skanks rather than ladies. Good job parents."
3,Arnel's feedback regarding TF Energon Hotshot,"The item I received was NOT the item pictured in the description. I was very dissappointed, to say the least. I mean, I paid for the item and all, but it was not what I wanted."
4,Sparkles!,I bought some of these last year and hung them on my Christmas tree. They were so pretty that I bought some more for this year. They sparkle for a reasonable price.
3,This book was extremely gripping - couldn't put it down,It was a phenominal rendition of smelly balls and tubesteaks. I was unable to put it down until I had finished reading the entire book. I highly recommend this author if you are into fisting bungholes and packing fudge.
5,Outstanding book,"This book is a real gem. Clinical stories are woven together with a neurological approach. In this book, I met some of the most fascinating cases involving the brain and behavior. I would think almost anybody could enjoy this book, and learn a great deal about how important our biology is in forming who we are and how we evolved, without ignoring individual differences and the environment. Klawans was not afraind to tackle the ""big"" questions like evolution of the mind/brain and bring them to the lay reader in such as fun way!"
5,A must have!,"I took an interest in Bennie K when I heard one of their songs on Last.fm. I was intrigued so I looked up some of their songs and video's on youtube. I was blown away. They manage to mix hip-hop, pop, truly worthy of the genre J-Urban. I, generally hate rap, and hip-hop but I loved this. This CD in particular doesn't really have a bad song on it. I recommend it for anyone hoping to take an interest in Japanese Music, Bennie K is a great place to start."
3,It's a book....,"What more do you want from it? I needed it for my English class and it's very boring. Surprise, surprise."
3,Trimbrite Tape,"Pretty average tape...not cut with too much precision...tape has slivers of flash adhered...it's a pain to trim prior to clear coat application...tape sometimes distorts if you try to pull it off...however,on the plus side,free prompt shipping...kinda makes up for lack of uniformity..."
5,Gathering Blue,"It was a great second book in the giver series. Loved the pace, and the story line. Can't wait to read the messenger."
2,Disappointed,Not nearly as good as the giver. But I have to keep reading to know what will happen in the end.
3,gathering blue student review,"Hi I'm a six grader and I read the book Gathering Blue.This book is about a girl named Kira who's mother died and father didn't want her.This book was interesting in the middle because in the begining I really didn't understand what was happening to Kira but at the middle I started to get what was happening to her.The person who I recommend this book would be my old teacher Ms.Duphiney because she likes books that leaves you geussing.I would give this book 3 stars because this book isn't really what I was looking for,but my favorite part was when she had to build a cage for herself to live in.DONE."
1,Gathering Blue,I read the Gathering Blue which was written by Lois Lowry. It is a fantasy. It is about a girl who is crippled in her leg named Kira. She has to walk with a cane.Some other people in Kira's village want her out because she is worthless. When the Council of guardians find out she is good at weaving they decide to keep her in the village to repair an important robe.I liked it because it was suspenseful. You didn't know what was going to happen to Kira at the time.Was she going to be killed? Or worse?
1,Gathering Blues,"This book started out great, but it ended too soon. The author seemed to have just stopped writing and decided to end at the most exciting point. It wasn't one of best books that Lois Lowry has written. ...."
4,Gathering Blue,"I have not finished this book, so I'm not sure how things end. Just hoping it goes along with the other books somehow and not just by having the same idea by being futuristic."
3,Gathering Blue book review,My impression of this book is that I really liked it. I liked it because the book was very goo at making you want to read on more and it also gave a great description of people and things in the book. Gathering Blue is best suited for people who like sad begginnuings but happy endings. I found it very interesting with all the details and descriptions Lois Lowry used in the book. gathering Blue is a good book to read and I recommend it to any girl who wants a sit down and read it all at once book.
4,Gathering Blue - A Sixth Grade Review,"Exciting and mesmerizing! I would give this book four and a half stars. No matter what, you just have to keep reading. I really enoyed the topic of the book, about an orphan with a twisted leg who lives in a world where the weak ones are cast aside and sent to the ""Field of Beasts."" I wish the book had a better ending, but other than that it was wonderful. The best part of the book was a big surprise in the mid-ending. I would recommend this book to all ages."
1,Amber's Awesome Review,"Gathering Blue was written by an author that I really enjoy reading. Louis Lowry also wrote a book called The Giver. The Giver was one of my favorite books. For some reason I thought Gathering Blue was going to be like The Giver. Little did I know, Gathering Blue was nothing like it. The two books had kind of the same style, but with the characters, they were all different. I would not recommend reading Gathering Blue, however, if you are a reader that enjoys reading boring, uninteresting books, then Gathering Blue is the book for you!"
1,About Gathering Blue,"I absolutely hated this book. It was very boring, and i just didn't want to finish the book; it was so bad!! It is very identical to her other book, ""The Giver."" If you liked to read ""The Giver"" then u'll love this book..."
3,Review of the Giver,"I believe this was a rather good book. At the begining I did have to go on the internet and read a summary of it because I did not understand it. I thoght I was reading about Aliens or something. But yes a very well thought of book, I thought it was extremely interesting. I liked the book because it showed how strong willed one person can be to hold everyone in the communities pain and suffering. Also shows how brave somepeople are."
5,Beautiful,"Here's a touching novel with a great moral. Kira, the main character of Gathering Blue is a girl with a lame leg who lives in a future world that has a simple rule - all those who are weak must go. Somehow, Kira's mother saved her from the demise; but now that Kira's mother is dead, the first thing that happens to Kira is that she is accused of being lame and brought to the council of Guardians. Surprisingly, the Council saves Kira because of the special gift she has to make beautiful embroidery. Kira stays in a special room and discovers another child like her who also has a unique talent named Thomas. Kira, Thomas, and a younger boy named Matt together find the secret of their village. This is a great book for all teens."
5,Another compelling look at future societies,"Gathering Blue, by Lois Lowry, is another great novel about a future society. Though it is called a companion novel to The Giver, Lowry's earlier book about a future Utopian society, Gathering Blue is by no means a sequel. It follows the life of Kira, an orphan girl with a twisted leg trying to survive in a society that shuns and discards the weak. After her mother dies, Kira faces a life or death trial in front of the Council of Guardians. She is given the important job of being the threader of the sacred Singer's Robe. There, she meets Thomas the Carver, little Jo, the future Singer, and Matt, a troublesome tyke. This novel makes you think of where our current society is heading, and what we will become if we do- a greedy, self-centered world with no diversity and much power. Gathering Blue is a wonderfully written book that is sure to make you wonder how you can prevent this society from coming into full existence."
2,Gathering blue,This book was very hard to see how it related to The Giver. It made more sense after I read The Messenger.
3,Gathering Blue Review,"This was a different book. I have read ""The Giver"" and and this book, in any way wasn't as good. But this book wasn't bad either. Sure, it wasn't what I thought it was going to be about. I thought it was gonna be about Jonas and Gabe.But back to the review.I thought the book was slow until the end when she (spoiler) meets her Dad and learns about the other villages or yonder"
4,Gathering Blue,"I really loved The Giver and thought I would read this book too. I'm not quite sure how it is a companion to The Giver, but this is a wonderful story in it's own. Now to read the other two books."
4,Megan's Review,This book is about a girl named Kira. She was sent to a place were you are only alowed to go there if you have a special talent and if your gaurdians died. alot of things happen there.Kira has special talent in her fingers.There is alot of killings inthis book.They believe there are beasts in the forest.If you have a disablity you will not get sent to the field but if you dont sometimes you might get sent to work in the field.
4,"Not as good as The Giver, but still good...","I bought this because it was by Lois Lowry, and then I realized it was the companion novel to The Giver--one of my absolute favorite books. That was a few years ago and they are still two of my favorite books. The plot was weaker in Gathering Blue than in The Giver, but in some ways Kira's character is more developed than Jonas--mostly because she's isolated and Jonas is surrounded by other people that also need to be described. It was an interesting contrast between a world with no technology and a world that was basically communistic, but highly technologically so. They both have one major thing in common, though--the people are unaware of how much control they really (don't) have. Gathering Blue is a good book with an interesting and deep view of life."
2,Gathering blue...,"I didnt really like this book because it seemed so corny to me. Although the scenery and time period were cool, the main charactar really annoyed me because the whole book was basically about one incident or about gathering blue cloth. The ending wasnt that great either. overall, i think this book may be good for younger children...but definatley not for teens."
1,gathering blue,"gathering blue is a story about a girl named kira and the difficulties she encounters. the story opens the readers mind to what it would be like to live in a very cruel society with different values than those of many people today. but, the story also has similarities to our current world. many of the people are poor. they bicker often, although to more extent than ordinary people. those who have great talents are rewarded and recognized, but their lives are changed. not unlike proffesional athletes, actors or singers. gathering blue is a story that creates ideas on how the world could change in the future."
4,gathering up some blue,"Gathering Blue was a great book. At first I found it boring and stupid, but as I kept read it seemed to get more and more interesting. Some of the characters were people that you wouldn't see on a daily basis. Kira is paralyzed and has had a hard life, Matt is a dirty little boy who lives in the Fen, and Jo is a cute little girl who was born to sing. There are more people but you will have to read and find out. Kira and her friends have to work their way through troubles and lies. Kira also gets a suprise and finds out a hidden secret."
2,Weird,"This is definitely the weirdest book I've read. The seting and everything was...indescribable. I read it last year and have forgotten it. It has frequent ""lulls in the action"" and won't leave you wanting more."
4,Great story,I didnt even know the Giver was a trilogy!! The giver was one of my absolute favorite books in High School. Then I found more to the story!! What a treasure! Its a great book. I'm reading the Messenger next. This book is different than the Giver but the stories are connected.
3,Not what I was expecting,"This book was very simple easy to understand. Supposed to be a YA book, but felt more like a children's book. Was very simply written. I figured out the plot within the frist 20% of the book and felt like it couldn't finish soon enough. Vivid descriptions, easy to read but lacking any challenge likeThe Giver (illustrated; gift edition). Easy for young readers, less of a true Dystopian book than that of The Giver. Looking forward to the last book to see if it ties the 2 books together. This book does not continue the story in The Giver, it is a new story."
5,Gathering Blue,"I was really hoping to hear more about Jonas and Gabe, but very quickly into the book I was completely wrapped up in Kira's life.Lois Lowry is a great author, she is just brillant at creating these different places and people.I absolutely LOVED Kira's little friend, Matt and his words, I was cracking up laughing! He did become a favorite of mine.I also loved little Jo, very cute character. I liked her friend Thomas, too, so basically I'm attached to all the characters and hope to catch up with them again in the third book!Like the first book, I could not put this one down."
5,wonderful sequel,"this is the sequel to maybe one of the best books ever, the giver. while you dont get to see any of the same characters, you enter another dystopian society but that is very different from the last. if you loved the giver you have to read this."
5,The Best Book,I thought Gathering Blue was a great book! When I read it I just couldn't wait to turn to the next page. If you really like exciting books you will love Gathering Blue.
4,Bryanas opinon,"This book really gives mixed feelings, from despair to great happiness. I feel the ending should have had more description, because basically i had to perdict. Perdicting does take your imagination far places Louis might of done that for a purpose but i still feel that there should have been an explanation of what life turned out to be for Kira. But the ending did not throw off my opinon about the good things in the book, i truly like this book because there is surprises and little things that make you shocked, happy, or even sad. this book was very good~bryana..radical readers SYCAMORE"
3,Unfinished Ending,"I was recommended to try Lois Lowry's and I found this one. The story was started quite dark in tone, growing fiercer as we were introduced to the future civilization after The Ruin (which I assumed is somekind of World War).I liked the plot and the way it is presented with first POV but somehow it was too dry. Everything seemed clicked too easily that I was not surprised by the turn of events (except for the realization of what they really were... that was something :)).I think it still needs a finishing because the closing chapter feels like an opening to further events."
4,Breathtaking,"""Mother?"" There was no reply.Gathering Blue is a Newberry Award book it's breathtaking.Kira is a 12 yearold orphan with a twisted leg.She's fierce and will not give up anything,Lois Lowery has written a amazing book that everyone canenjoy all the time.I think this book is suitable for ages 10-14.By: Lauren"
3,Gathering Blue By: Lois Lowry,"Imagine losing both parents. This is what Kira experinced. Kira's mom passed away because of an illness and Kira's dad died of a beast in the woods. How wil Kira survie? One of her legs is useless, because it is twisted. One women named Vandara wants to get rid of Kira. Now she has to go to the Council of Guardians(Court). AT this court she has a protector named Jamison. After, that's over with the Guardians have plans for her. Her natural ability in weaving keeps her extant. Her house was burned down.

One day Matt is missing from the village where is he and why? Find out in this astonishing book."
3,Gathering Blue,Gathering Blue is about a girl named Kira she was born with a twisted leg her mother got sick and died and her brother and her father died when she was little . So now she has to fight for her life and land. Now Kira has to go to the council of Guardians Kira is allowed to live if she has to weave the singers robe Vandara is taking Kira's land for the little kids there is an appartment for orhpans with abilities to help so kira and her friends hear singing one night and matt says thats jo.

He tells kira nthat he had a daughter and that he had a dautghter with a twisted leg and she finds out that he is her father. I gave this book 3 stars becuase i wasnt real interested in it i would suggert this topeople who under stand books really well.
3,Connection?,"There did not seem to be any continuity between the first book of the trilogy and this book. Overall, I would recommend it."
4,Lois Lowry does not disappoint,"I have always enjoyed her work and this adds to my collection of easy weekend reads. I also going to get the rest of the quartet to round out the world of ""The Giver"""
3,An enjoying read - A bit disconnected from The Giver,"When I learned The Giver had sequels I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to find out what happened to Jonas and Gabe. I had to check several times while reading Gathering Blue to see if it was the first sequel. I didn't recognize any of the characters/events and I was worried that I missed something. Despite the second-guessing, the story was enjoyable and in the context of the entire series everything makes sense now. Well worth the read if you like The Giver."
3,Easy read - not that exciting,"Nothing like The Giver, questioning why it's a trilogy, but perhaps the 3rd book will tie them all together? Quick, easy read but nothing of substance and highly predictable."
3,Almost perfect,"Gathering Book was a wonderful story of a child growing up in a post-apocolptic dystopia. Though this story has some similarities to the Giver, because while the settings are nearly polar opposites, (an interesting question to ask is, if given choice would you rather live in Jonas's world or in Kira's?) the theme of a special child learning resposiblity are identical in both books.Gathering Blue was on the whole an excellent read, but abrupt and unsatisfying ending and the muliple loose plot threads detracted from the book. The ending lacked any kind of closure that was desperatly needed."
4,A good read,"I grabbed this book on the way to the cash register because I am a fan of ""The Giver"". I started reading it when I got home and couldn't put it down. It is an interesting read and I recommend it."
3,Gathering Blue,"Gathering Blue, written by Lois Lowry was an alright book. It took place in Kira's controlling community. Gathering Blue was about a girl named Kira,who was borned handicapped and who's mother passed away from a disease. She doesn't know what to do, because nobody can take care of her. Kira's father lives in a free community where everybody helps each other out and there aren't any dictators. She ends up choosing to stay in her controlling community and go to the Council of Guardians and finds out that they already have a plan for her. Their plan is for her to become a seamstress for the singer's robe. Her talent of sewing saved her life."
5,"Got the Blues, by Noah Downes","I thought this book was very imaginative and hard to put down. It had an unusual plot with interesting characters. As in ""The Giver,"" the community was communistic yet the people had more freedom. The way the community was set up was kind of twisted. The ""Elders"" used people with special talents to preserve the past intact for future people. One person was supposed to sew scenes of history onto a cloak. Another was supposed to carve scenes on a staff. Then a singer was supposed to sing the events that happened. Another thing I found interesting was when a lost character returned. Kira's mother, Katrina, had told her that Kira's father Christopher was dead. By the end of the book, he turns up in Kira's life again. Though like ""The Giver,"" I did not like the way the book ended, the author does tell the reader what's going on at the end. I never got a full description about what happened, though I suppose, the author may want the reader to imagine what would happen."
4,A great book with a lack of a sufficient ending.,"This book had my interests, everything from Kira's struggle for life to her adventures with Thomas and Matt. I truly hated Vandara when she tried to end Kira's life over a little plot of land. The survival-of-the-fittest attitude of the community made the book even more exciting. I feared for Kira when she too feared of her life after her mother's death. All of this was for nothing, because the book was cut short. Sure, she may of thought that she had the answer to the perfect world, but how was she going to do this? It was a shame that we were not told of how this was to be done. Overall, this was a great book, but the ending leaves you out to dry."
5,2nd of a great trilogy,"If you enjoyed the Giver, you will love this 2nd in this great trilogy. Different characters but it ties the first book together in the end."
2,questionable at best,"First of all,the book arrived quickly and i would give the seller 5 stars.I got this book because I loved The Giver, and this is a 'companion novel'. but this book is terrible by comparison. nothing at all happens in the first three quarters of the book, and when things do start happening they are not all that interesting. I have not read The Messenger yet, which is the third of The Giver trilogy, but I hope that the time I wasted reading this book will be somewhat relevant"
2,Okay,The book was good but left out information. You don't know much about kira' s background until the end. Also like in The Giver you don't know what happens next. THIS IS NOT THE SEQUEL TO THE GIVER. This is a good book except for the end because you never find out what happens next. This is very disappointing compared to the giver..
4,"Does not continue The Giver, FYI","I went in to this book thinking it would be a continuation of The Giver, thinking I would see what happened to Jonas and Gabriel after leaving their society. That is not the case.I enjoyed Gathering Blue... I can't say that you'll find me reading it again as it wasn't a story that really captures you or enthralls you... but it was a good story.The characters are well created, their motives and abilities are explained well. You feel for Kira, Thomas, Matt, Jo, and the others.And though, while the story was good, it felt almost light. It felt like there could have been a monumental story there, one that left you begging for more while being unable to put the book down, but we just don't really get that delivered to us. A great story was told, but could have been so much more."
4,Good Teen Read,A friend of mine is a teacher so she lent me this book. I found it well written and the story pretty interesting.It takes place on earth after some kind of disaster where people go back to a more natural way of life. Kira who is disabled is given a special task in the community but soon she discovers many secrets about her village and their way of life.I would have definitely liked to read this in grade or high school.
4,"not ""the giver"" but very good","A sequel to ""The Giver"" not as powerful but still worthy of attention. A young girl with the gift of weaving is given a home after her mother passes away and leaves her (she thinks) an orphan. As she meets other children in her position, and begins to realize that something sinister is going on, the girl starts to think about her gift, how it is being used, and why. Toward the end, she receives news that her father may be alive after all. The book can be read as an examination of what bargains we make with ourselves in order to nurture our gifts, and how what can further them can also take away from our pleasure in them. Recommended."
3,gathering blue,"I think Gathering Blue was an okay book. It seemed sort-of boring at times, but exciting at others. Its about a girl named Kira who becomes an orphan when her mother dies. She decides to build a home, but was taken to court. At court the council of guardians notice her talent for sewing, so she was asked to stay with them. She was to sew a robe for a singer, Jo. For help, she visits a woman named Anabella, who helps her make colored thread to make the robe beautiful. Kira learns to make many colors excepr blue, which she must learn to make on her own. Along the way many interesting things happen, but to find out what they are, you need to read the book yourself."
4,gathering blue,it is a really awsome book when you get into it. i suggest that you were 12or13 to read the book is a challenging book with hard words.
4,It was good,"Overall I found that the book was incredible. It used flowing, yet understandable language. Also, it kept the reader entertained throughout. Most of all, it provided the most important thing that a book can give, escape. A book must provide a world that the reader can get lost in and that you can immerse yourself in. Without escape there is no point in reading a fiction book. This provides exactly that. The reader can read this book for hours as you get lost in the town and Kira's life. However, there are a few flaws in the book. Some of the plot twists in the novel can be somewhat predictable especially if you read the prequel, The Giver. As you read the book the reader can figure some of the stuff out before Kira does. However, I was overall it was an amazing book and I would recommend it to everyone."
4,Powerful and thought provoking. Refreshing.,"I enjoyed this book immensely. It had the same lilting prose that The Giver and Gossamer had and it was very easy for me to get through. It was like a light souffle in a world of heavy and rich courses.I liked the characters well enough, and was fascinated by the fact that we were as ignorant as the characters. Of course, it ends a bit like The Giver did, but that was better in a way. Definitely a good quick read on a rainy afternoon. Not too complex, you could keep the characters straight, and even if it was a little predictable, it was refreshing."
2,Less than Ideal Preparation.,"I went in to take the CLEP test today, after using CLEP Principles of Management to study. I had gone over each of the sample tests at least 3 times. I had thoroughly reviewed the material. And I was in the dark through most of the test.Some concepts that show up on the test (PERT and Critical Path, among others) aren't even mentioned in the book. While the book focuses largely on history and people who developed the science of management, the actual test's focus is completely different. Groping through new material, I was shell-shocked to take the actual test.I've taken 7 of these CLEPs. Most of the College Board CLEP books are great. But not this one.As it is, I barely squeaked by with a passing grade. My advice: find another book."
3,it is ok...,"it is ok. yes, i passed with a 50. I feel that there is much needed data missing from this text if you are trying for a higher score... The human development was a GREAT book and so was prinicples of marketing those two i scored 64 & 70 on."
3,Principles of Management,"After taking the clep test, I didn't feel like the material in the book helped a lot. It seemed to be outdated."
4,CLEP: Principles of Management,"The book arrived in perfect condition as advertised and within the timeframe stated. I was a first time user of Amazon.com, now it's my first resource for quality items at an incredible price."
4,Back to school after all these years!,"I am a returning student and have elected to complete my BA in Business at a school that will give me credit for what I have already experienced and learned. I also can save money by taking a few CLEP courses. This book was great. It has helped me fill in much of the technical side of management.I have accomplished much without a business degree, and believe I may have been able to accomplish even more.Great work!Jeff in Green Bay, WI"
2,Good for overview of management principles if not for exam preparation,"I read this book out of interest with no intention of taking the exam. I don't know if this book does a great job preparing a candidate for the exam. However, I can say it gave me a concise survey of many management principles and I enjoyed practicing the multiple choice questions. The content of this book got me thinking of the merits of all the management I've ever experienced."
4,Good value and resource.,"Bought this study guide and used it for four weeks to pass the CLEP Business. Worked like a charm, I passed it with flying colors using only this book!Great value for test prep!"
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"Amazon has this item in the gluten free section, but it is NOT GLUTEN FREE. And you can NOT RETURN the item. Amazon needs to fix this immediately. No buyer should be given incorrect information and then made to keep the product that is not what it was sold as. I make several purchases a month from Amazon and this is the most disappointed I have been with a purchase."
5,Fantastic!,"Dr. McDougall's organic maple brown sugar light oatmeal is a fanatstic, healthy way to start your day. Made from organic oats & naturally sweetened, this hot cereal is miles ahead of the national brands found in your neighborhood grocery store. This oatmeal a delicious whole-grain, fiber rich way to make breakfast more nutritious. In fact, Dr. McDougall's instant oatmeal is a great light snack anytime of the day! Given the great deal Dr. McDougall's is on Amazon.com, national & bargain store brands of instant oatmeal simply cannot compete, even in a tight economy! Very well worth a try! Highly recommended!"
1,"Limited taste, if any","When they say ""light,"" they mean ""VERY LIGHT!!!"" This product tastes like water. I only ordered it to try it, but will never re-order."
3,Didn't really care for it.,"Something just didnt taste right about this oatmeal. Maybe I am just spoiled by my quaker. lol Anyway, I gave it away."
5,Dr. McDougall's organic oatmeal,"This oatmeal is the best! I've been eating Quaker maple & brown sugar since I was a kid and and this blows Quaker away! If you order McDougall's through subscribe and save the price is exactly the same as Acme store brand maple and brown sugar. The consistency is different than Quaker. Probably the biggest difference I noticed is with Quaker I've always noticed a grainy type texture with every spoonful. Guess I just got used to that over the years. With McDougall's, all you can taste is the real oatmeal flavor with a nice touch of maple and brown sugar. Subscribe and save has made going organic much easier on my pocketbook too. There is no dollar amount on the fact that it gets delivered to my front door, saving me precious time and gas from going all the way to the nearest Whole Foods for a healthier chioce in eating. It's delicious, cheap and so good for you. Thanks Amazon for your subscribe and save program!"
4,They're never coming back to earth.,"Gantz Graf is a violent explosion of sound bits. The other two tracks are less violent, but still constructed of bits. I don't think Ae use a single sound element that lasts longer than a few milliseconds. It's like sonic pointillism.Is it any good? Yeah, of course it's good- tightly constructed, well-mastered, relentlessly pushing the barrier of music. Like all Ae, it's a quality product. However, I can't imagine being in a mood where I would think ""Gee, I think Gantz Graf would fit perfectly...""However, I do find the Gantz Graf single more satisfying than Confield was. Maybe this is just because the dense constructions of late-period Autechre lend themselves better to small chunks (Confield seemed to lend itself well to large headaches).In any event, Autechre has passed beyond the ""event"" horizon. They are spiralling toward some center of sonic abstraction, their releases becoming exponentially more exotic and alien. They're never coming back to earth."
2,Granular synthesis galore,"I don't know about this one. The title track sounds as if they simply played some musical phrases and then just put the output through a series of granular synthesizers, switching them on and off. It's a cheap trick that anybody with some knowledge of the tools involved can pull off. The main trick is to totally let go of any preconceived musical notion one might have had before. Locking yourself up for a few days in a room with the only sound being white noise might just help with that, I guess."
2,Annoying,"Gantz Graf is mostly a misstep for an otherwise excellent band. The first two tracks, especially the title track, are annoying drill and glitch messes, basically incoherent and pointless. Looking back, I realize that it was this release that put me off Autechre for about a decade, thinking they'd finally gone off the deep end. Luckily, I heard good things about Oversteps and am now back-filling my collection with all the intervening albums. Still, this is really bad, although the final track partially redeems the release with an amazing buildup of speed and intensity. Skip it unless you're a completist."
4,From Amber To Chastic Slide,"Granz Graf is a transition recording for Autechre. This is where I see Chastic Slide type sound coming into focus. For me, it is Dial and Cap IV that make the recording worthwhile. Any melodies on this record are downplayed to the fuzzy percussive sound. But with this record, the sound is manipulated very well by the band. If I did not know anything about Autechre, I might have thought this is just a nonsense record, but since the duo has been around for over ten years now, it is satisfying to see how they have shaped their sound at various points along the way. One thing you can expect with Autechre is that you NEVER know what to expect! Just like life. Great spin!"
4,Formerly Japan,"Japan was such a great group, it such a shame people cannot get along together. Individually they all certainly have talent but collectively they were such a great band. Though there are not the outstanding songs such as on Gentlemen Take Polaroids, Quiet Life, Tin Drum there is something about the Japan sound that is very appealing. If you like this check out some of their earlier albums (CD's)."
3,Pro photographers beware,"For professional photographers looking for a relatively inexpensive, slim, portable light box to show clients original chromes,I suggest the Gepe as a better alternative. The illumination with the Porta-Trace is uneven and the construction is rather cheap. On the positive side, the surface does stay cool unlike the Gepe, so light and heat damage are minimized. Curious to see how long this will last. Also, this is coming from one of the mail order companies out of New York, so in the event of a return or exchange, customer service issues are always a consideration. The estimated shipping time is longer to the west coast."
1,Buyer Beware,When I received this item it was completely scratched up. This light is too low as well. Watch out if buying this from the price pros!!
5,So crazy it must be true!,"My father had this book hidden away in one of our storage closets and I found it while digging... He said it was all crap, but I'd beg to differ! I sat down and read it in one afternoon. Andrew Tomas presents so many ideas that, if you really take the time to think about it, coincide perfectly with current scientific knowledge. He makes his case, saying that we can't possibly be the first race to have lived on Earth. How else could the pyramids have been built with such perfect precision with their technology, or how could ancient philosophers have known the Earth was a sphere, or that there were planets beyond Saturn? I highly recommend this book to those who have an open mind and are willing to question everything we have discovered thus far."
5,"Ineresting, veryinteresting","This is one of the books that really don't answer a lot of questions but instead open a whole world of possibilities. What if even half of the suppositions are correct, really makes you think. If ever proven ,the world as we know it would be turned on it's ear. What if? What if?"
4,Great little radio,"I really like this radio. I use it by my bed, then carry it into the shower in the morning, then take it with me while I make and eat my breakfast. I also have a Tivoli PAL, but I really appreciate the digital tuning presets on the Songbook to let me switch away from commercials in the morning. I would say the sound from the PAL is slightly better, but this is still surprisingly good. I'm not blown away by the reception, but it's alright. One issue I've had with both radios is that AM reception declines while it is charging. All in all, this radio fulfills it's function almost perfectly, with the bonuses of being able to use it in the shower and to plug an MP3 player into it. As other reviewers have said, it would be nice to have more presets, as well as TV and weather bands."
1,"Bought three, two have failed!!","I was introduced to Tivoli by my brother who had a early model PAL radio. Bought two SongBooks for myself and one as a gift for my father-in-law. Really not happy with these radios. The sound is mediocre at best and I would say better for listening to talk radio than music. The blue SongBook (I bought red and blue ones) has the worst sticky finish on it and its impossible to clean and feels disgusting to pick up. The REAL reason I have to give it such a low rating is failure rate. One of mine died completely and had to be shipped back to Tivoli. My father-in-laws did the same thing and they blamed it on a faulty power cord but would not ship him a new one until he shipped them the radio and cord for assessment (and the courier charge was not covered).Finally, don't let these radios sit in the sun as they overheat and shut down. We use them by our pool but have to put them in the shade under a chair or else they fail in about 30 minutes.I would not buy another."
2,Problems with case,"This radio sounds great and the ease of controlling the stations is wonderful. It really fit the bill for the need I wanted to fill - portable with digital preset stations that would be easy to change.I have a big problem with the exterior of the radio. I have the yellow one, so the other colors may not have the same issue. I've owned the radio for about 9 months. The exterior of the radio has become ""tacky"", as in adhesive. My fingers stick to the unit when I pick it up but more importantly so does dirt. The unit has become filthy and I cannot figure a way to clean it without destroying the plastic case with a solvent. Very bad design for the case."
1,Not as pictured,"I ordered this because the picture was of the MATTE Yellow SongBook with black knobs. What I was sent was the GLOSS Yellow with silver knobs.I have been looking for the Matte one on Amazon, but should have just bought it directly from Tivoli."
3,Dreamy and enjoyable EP,"Following the return to form to the Dream or Jangle Pop that made them alternative staples in the late 80's and early 90's, Denmark is a catchy song that stays in your head. The three remaining songs are not as strong as the other songs on ""Davy Jones' Locker"", but 'Sweetheart, You're Surrounded', 'Walk Away', and 'Mood Swing' are enjoyable to listen to. If you are debating between the Denmark EP or the full CD, I would go for ""Davy Jones' Locker""."
5,The Best of David Hamilton,"What is there not to like about David Hamilton's photography? ""The Best of..."" doesn't begin to cover the breadth of his art, but is an excellent taste of his work. It captures the beauty of nature, youth, maturity, eroticism, sensuality, thought,humor, curiosity, tranquility through the eyes of his lenses, and his own stylistic interpretation. ""The Best of...."" is, in a phrase, relaxation for the eyes."
5,"Excellent and entertaining! Gold, gold, and more gold!",Lots of Spanish bacgrounds. The reader gets entrapped in it
1,not working with Nokia 6350,the headset is not working with my nokia 6350. its waste of time and money..don't buy for similar hand set.
3,Ear piece to large.,Nokia Oem E66 E71 E71X 6350 6790 Surge Fold 6010 6161 6162 7705 Hs-40 HeadsetI know my head is larger then the average persons. it is way to large to stay in your ear. What good is it if you have to hold it to your ear.
2,Happy Birthday Zack,"This episode is about Zack the black ranger's birthday.While the other rangers are busy trying to throw him a surprise birthday party at Ernie's juicebar,he thinks they have forgoten about him.Also Rita has a surprise for him too;the Nasty Knight her newest monster.After he and the rangers come and bond together to defeat Rita's monster he has an great birthday!"
3,"NOT THE BEST,BUT COOL!","When the kids secretly plan a surprise party for Zack(Black Ranger),he thinks everyone's forgotten his birthday.Watching from her lair,RITA REPULSA hasn't forgotten,though.And her birthday gift to Zack is the evil,invincible sword-swinging Knasty Knight!With Zack fighting to survive the monster's gnarly,onslaught,only the Power Rangers can possible save thier friend-and the entire planet. Not my favortie,but still enjoyable.This is volume 4 in the series and very hard to find.The cast is great but to me the story wasn't so great,but still enjoyable.The Knasty Knight is one tuff monster."
1,Exercise Alot,wore it for 4 10+ mile runs and got water in it somehow. Doesnt work anymore. Had it for 2 weeks. Never went swimming with it even though it says its water resistant up to 50meters. not too happy about it
1,They just want you to buy the upgrade,It's as if they stripped out most of the functions on purpose...I guess they want customers to be frustrated with this software so you'll buy their expensive upgrade.I hope they take my return instead.
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I thought with the ""Better Homes and Gardens"" name it would be quality software. Boy was I wrong. I couldn't get anything drawn accurately and when I tried to do a simple 3D view of what I did get drawn my computer crashed. I sold it last week at a garage sale for $5 and I felt guilty doing it."
1,Don't buy this for landscaping,"I needed landscape design software, and since all the other products had gotten poor reviews and this software had not, I decided to try it. No one else had mentioned the landscape portion of the software, so I didn't really know what to expect. I'm sure this program is fine if you want to design a house, or an addition to your house, but if you desire lanscaping software, pass. The plant library is very small and does not include many common landscaping plants, and you can forget about finding something exotic or unusual. The software only allows one to draw circular or kidney shaped beds. Yes, you can attempt to drag the beds to the desired dimensions, but the effect is less than desirable. For landscaping, this was an expensive dud."
3,Lots of Missing Features,"If you want a program to give you an idea on how a new room or garage will look, this program is for you. If you want a program that will help you change your ideas for colors and placement, this program is for you.But if you want a program that will help you design and build your entire living area, this program will not work for you. For example, it has no pools - so forget about building one. The landscaping portion can't help you with drainage, so you may build a building on your property, but you may end up with a flood plain.Need a retaining wall - ask a contractor to come out - this program can't make a 3' wall.It's OK for land gradations and showing you the slope of the land. It's OK for exterior walls, but the colors are limited and you can't use the windows color pallette to choose the EXACT color you want.Three stars is perfect for an OK program."
2,Suitable for only the simplest designs,"If you want to design and build a box with a simple A-frame roof, then this tool is for you. For any modern design with multiple roof lines, gable walls, bonus rooms, etc. it just doesn't work. Also, the window library is not very good and there are no way to build your own windows, i.e. put an eliptical transom over a window, etc."
1,Almost worthless for anything but a box with a roof,"I bought this software to help design an addition to my house, but Home Designer Suite 6 is not even able to let me draw my existing house, a 1400 square foot house with an attached garage.The problem is more than one style of roof, and a mud room attached to the front of the house. Home Designer cannot accept more than 1 roof style, and does not allow me to add a roof to the mud room without automagically changing the roof on the main part of the house.I feel really stupid for spending $80 on this product, and will probably go back to paper and pencil."
2,Oversold by advertizing,"This is a decent product but I thought it would be alot easier to do. If you want to design a box it is easy, but attempting to design a multilevel home is extremely difficult. Getting hit with some much marketing to upgrade the product I beleive this is just a piece of candy for you to buy the upgrade."
2,A disappointment,"I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed. They definately oversell it as an interior design tool. Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product. As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great. I wish all software had that."
1,How do you change the wall length????,"Drawing the walls is easy but how do you change the dimensions? I want to redesign my bathroom, which takes up an overall space of about 8' x 11'. The program automatically assigns it dimensions of 60' x 60'. This is as big as a house! The tutorial says don't worry, change it later. But it never tells you how. If someone knows, please tell me. In the meantime, I consider this program virtually useless."
1,don't buy this,"For all its hype, the software will not design to scale. Even had a CAD trained expert try. Found it to be worthless in designing our home addition... wasted $83. Don't buy it."
1,impossible to use!,I bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use. I am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy! It was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you're a professional architect/ computer genius!
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper. Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect. It turns out that this is exactly the same software!I strongly recommend looking for something better.
4,great for a beginner!,"I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual. It practically loaded and started itself. Overall, I am very impressed. The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design. I better read the book again. I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas."
1,Not for detailed working drawings.,"This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money."
2,Indiv commentaries range from poor to excellent.,"The CD-ROM version's usefulness is severely limited in that it contains NO bibliographic info on any of the individual commentaries. In other words, it must be used in conjunction with the books. The search tools are nice. Contains some excellent commentaries. Among the best are OT: Sailhamer on Genesis, Kaiser on Exodus, van Gemeren on Psalms, Archer on Daniel is not bad. NT: Carson on Matthew, Longenecker on Acts, Harris on 2 Corinthians. Also contains some stinkers: Thomas on Thessalonians. BOTTOM LINE: Save the price of the CD and by the best commentaries in their individual paperback volumes."
2,it was alright,the detail is not as vivid as in the picture It kinda of looks washed out and a little disappointed..
5,A Good Starter Text For Small Business,"I found this little book to be loaded with good ideas. It's a good starter text for small business owners seeking quick ideas in marketing. It is not very comprehensive, but the bright ideas it contains are workable. It's a good summary of information. It also covers some other areas that you do not find in other books, so I do highly recommend it for anyone seeking new strategies."
4,"The Audio Samples Play ""Oklahoma"", Not Specialty!! It's R&B, not R&H!! Holy Moly!","I usually can distinguish Little Richard from John Raitt without strenuous mental exertion, so I was amused to discover that the ""sample"" cuts on the Amazon site for this fine Specialty box set play cuts from Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Oklahoma"" instead of the gritty R&B; from the Specialty label. It's pretty funny, as it would be tough to think of music less funky, less black, than ""Oklahoma"". Well, okay, it's not that tough....Lawrence Welk is even unfunkier, unblacker. So is Perry Como. And I suppose ""Oklahoma"" is James Brown and his Fabulous Flames next to ""The Sound of Music"".Wop bop a loo bop a bop bam boom, what a beautiful mornin'!!!"
3,Good.. not Great,Maybe it's just me but I found the first three discs prettydull.Too much 12 bar blues and very little of it particularly inspired.There ARE some gems on these first 3...and the 4th and 5th discs are wonderful and so is the booklet...but I would only recommend it with reservations.The Chess Story and The AtlanticRythm & Blues Box Set are more interesting and varied overviewsof this this fantastic time and music.
5,It was great! Clay Walker has an outstanding voice!!!,Clay's voice is great! His lyrics are cute. He's made another great single!
1,"Outdated ""encyclopedia"" not a good source for avian info","The information in this book is out of date and in many cases, harmful to your pet if you practice any of it. This book advocates clipping only one wing to tame a bird which is dangerous in practice- it makes a bird more prone to injury when it takes flight. It also encourages misinformation about bird health; the book asserts that healthy cockatiels look healthy. In reality, sick birds do their best to hide their sicknesses because they are naturally prey animals. Other practices akin to phrenology in this book are simply invalid today. I would not recommend this for a new owner or anyone in need of practical advice for raising or caring for a cockatiel. While some of the information is correct, there is also enough misinformation to make an inexperienced owner a danger to their pets.At least the pictures are cute, so it's not a total loss."
2,Outdated,"I teach English to Japanese students. A couple of the brief introductions to American holidays have been helpful and there are a few good pictures for coloring. On the whole, however, this book is outdated and contains very little useful material, especially considering the size of it."
5,"Great, Underappreciated Band","I've seen Groovelily in concert twice now. They are the most refreshing thing I've heard in music in a long time. Go to their website (groovelily.com) and pick up their latest live recording. This is GL at it's best. Never before have you heard such full arrangements with only three musicians in your life. Val, Brendan, and Gene are some of the most talented musicians I've seen in a long time. Become a Pedal Pusher. Get hooked on Groovelily."
3,A Very Good Overview to Coaching Football,"This book by Tom Flores is very interesting and informational. It gives a very good overview of the aspects of football and coaching.

1,Counterfeit Spode!,"I ordered three teacups to replace some of mine that had broken over the years. When they arrived, they were not real Spode! Two of the cups I ordered were made in Malaysia; one was made in China. The cups had defects and were clearly different in the paint and in their shape. This is the second time I have ordered Spode from amazon.com and not gotten what I ordered - I'm never ordering Spode from here again. Amazon.com should also be careful lest Spode sue them for secondary infringement of trademark or copyright!"
4,Women In Racing worthy read,"""Women in Racing"" is a collection of stories from many different facets of women in the sport. And frankly, you'll be suprised at what some of them have to say.None of the chapters are too long and the book is just as good read skipping randomly from chapter to chapter as it would reading it cover to cover. Reading it is easy, no fighting to stick with a laboring plot line through 350 pages like some books.A very good read with interesting characters. The best part is, like Seabiscuit, the women in this book are real. That is better than fiction."
1,review,I guess I didn't realize the book was outdated. It is also in poor condition. I probably won't read it. It doesn't look anything like the picture of it. I wish I would have known the copyright and the condition before purchase.
2,"Nice sound, but boring !","I heard and liked the song ""easy People"" so I bought the cd. It works as background music but doesn't keep my attention for active listening. Close but no cigar."
5,The nields rule!!!,"I was really happy when they finally released this album. The nields are becoming more and more popular and this cd will put them on top of the charts! I've been a longtime fan of David, Dave, Dave, Nerissa, and Katrina; been to most every concert in the berkshire/boston/great barrington/north hampton areas, and they will never let you down. Trust me.....buy this cd!!!!"
5,I miss this product,I love this product and can't seem to find it anywhere. Went on vacation in Iowa and looked for it there. Then checked Amazon and was very disappointed to find out it was not available here either. I used 2 scoops plus 1 scoop hot chocolate mix. Delicious! I'm going to call the company maybe if it gets enough calls they will get it back on the shelf.
5,Folgers Cafe Latte,I bought 2 cases(6 each) of Folgers Cafe Latte flavor(Straight Up Latte) Price was right free shipping great experience with Amazon!! This product is very hard to find in my city!!! And also not at this price!!!
5,Folgers' Straight Up Latte is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me!,"I've been buying this locally for years. I exhausted the suppliers in Central Ohio and was getting worried I wouldn't be able to find more. Thank you, thank you for making this product available on Amazon. I order online in the morning and have it on my doorstep the next day! Life is good!"
3,a few gems and some interesting mix.,"I didn't know this was supposed to be a myles goodwin solo effort (until I read the other review!) , still I am glad it came out under the wine label instead because it adds some really classic songs for them to play like 'you won't dance with me' and 'holly wood' and as I am a wine fanatic that collects everything from this band that makes it a great deal for me. But this one isn't a rocker like what came before and since actually, it's a good pop cd though , and If I rated it as a pop cd alone I would say this is a great one but wine buyers want harder rock usually so it's average on a wine scale. One great thing here is that the production values are very well done and that would carry over into their next release."
1,"VERY Mellow,Slow--NOT A ROCKER!!!","If you like ""Harder,Faster""-""Power Play""-""First Glance"" or any 80's April Wine albums you will HATE this CD. There is Nothing remotely jamming each song made me want to PUKE!! For some reason Myles Goodwyn decided to pull out some old songs and make this album that none of his bandmates took part in..and you can hear why-$45.00 is the going price at this time HAHAHA-I bought it for 6.99 and sold it back for a buck-and didn't mind losing that money. If you really want this(I wouldn't know why) and live near Columbus OH it's at Singin' Dog. Good Luck!!"
3,Funny... is that enough? Perhaps not for me...,"This one sounds at times like the guys in the band decided to pay tribute to Budgie and write some songs with funny lyrics. Although I must admit that they have a bunch of other fun-lyrics-gems scattered across their discography so this is not a one-time fun craziness that all of a sudden overcame them in 1975-76. Anyway, ""Hard Times"" is hilarious - I am completely flabbergasted by the fact that it is not included in any compilation NOT EVEN in 4-cd Wine Collection... can you imagine that? I can't - there must be something unseemly going on in that small closeted world of music compilators... perhaps I should go there undercover and write an expose. I'll keep you posted. Now, back to the grind. ""Mama Laye"" is great as is ""You Won't Dance With Me"" but where are the rockers? none of them are good and that's a letdown. But still try and check it out."
5,Enjoyed the additional information in the back of the book,"This book had some additional information in it that gave me some more items to research. Right price. There are better books on the subject, but this is a quick read and might be a good book to share with friends."
5,"excellent, the best of it's kind",If you are looking through lots of books on this subject and can't make up your mind which one to get--- Get this book! But first pick up his other book En Route to Global Occupation. You'll notice that Gary Kah doesn't come out with a book a year. He doesn't seem interested in making money selling lots of books. He puts all of what he's got to say into these books! Christian parents will find this book valuable to help prepare their children for what they will face in their future regarding Jesus and world religion. Indispensible reading!
1,horrible,"I actually just threw this across the room. This is my 3rd baby / third time pumping. I've always used an Aventi manual pump and got this because it was cheaper. It's difficult to use, slow and impossible to clean. I hate throwing this away...such a waste but I can't take it anymore!!"
1,"It sucks, but not in the way you want it to.",Spend the extra $10-$15 and get a Medela!!!! I have used both and the Medela is way better. This one is awkward to use. You need both hands to use it effectively. Very disappointed. Go with Medela's manual pump if you can't afford an electric. Buy an electric if you can it is so worth it. (Lansinoh pump worked awesome for me)
1,Didn't even work as a temporary pump,"I ordered a fancy electric pump online and needed something to get me by for the 10 days it would take for the pump to arrive. I bought this hoping it would just do the minimum I needed until my pump came in the mail. It has been two days and about 10 pumpings and it has already broken. Basically, I spent $2 per use for this piece of crap."
1,Bad Pump,"The pump has poor suction compared to a very old Pur manual model my wife was using. Also, the flimsy construction is prone to having the pump valve dislodge. After replacing it, it never again allowed full range of pumping motion and suction was further decreased. Avoid if possible."
1,Poor Quality - don't waste your money,"If I had purchased this pump first I may have never known how bad it was. The pump I've been using for 5 months broke but it at least worked wonderfully before then. I bought the evenflo pump b/c it was the least expensive one I could find. Well, you get what you pay for. Please, please, please do not buy this pump. Even on the max suction it still has less than half the pumping power as my first one. New mommies: you do not want this pump."
1,"This pump doesn't suck... wait, yes it does","I needed a manual pump as a backup, in case I got caught away from home and needed to pump. Since I didn't anticipate using it much I thought it was a good idea to spend less and this one was cheaper than some of the other manual pumps. Within four uses the seal broke and it no longer had enough suction. I returned it for another and the second one lasted about twice as long before it went back to the store. I ended up with an Avent Isis and am completely loving it. Totally worth spending the extra $15 or so for. And, I actually like it better than my electric pump!"
1,do not buy this hand pump,"I went out of town and forgot my breast pump. I bought this pump for about twenty bucks. It took 30 minutes to pump 2 oz. I hand expressed the milk instead. My breasts were FULL and it could not pump hardly anything. The pumping action is VERY SLOW also, so not only is it totally ineffective it is slow too. I have the Medela hand pump and it is wonderful. do not buy this pump get the medela"
1,"Doesn't pump, just breaks over and over and over...","I bought this as a travel pump for a cruise I am going on so that I don't have to bring my huge electric double pump. Thankfully, I decided to try it out on an overnight wedding last weekend and after I put the bottle on the pump and tried to use it, the bottle would pop off every time I tried to depress the handle. Then I finally got my hand in a position to not put pressure on the bottle which is almost impossible because that is where the tork goes to offset the pump handle and the whole handle mechanism fell apart. I was so determined to make it work I fought with it for a good 30 minutes. I have no idea how this item could have actually gone into production because it doesn't work at all. This isn't even a matter of it being a bad item, it should actually be recalled because it doesn't even stay together much less work. I could use my hand and a ziplock with better results. =("
4,disney travel songs,"i like this CD because not only cuz its a disney CD but the songs are fun and i guess in a way singablethe songs i like the most are1. Come on, Let's Go4. Up, Up and Away5. Down by the Station/Chattanooga Choo Choo10. Arkansas Traveler/Chickens on Vacationand 12. Take Me Home, Country Roads"
2,MMPR; No Clowning Around,This is an early episode from mmpr.Its about when the rangers are at a carnival at Angel Grove but really the carnival is a trap by Rita Repulsa and all the clowns are really putties on the downlow.Plus Rita has created a new monster that has turned Trini's cousin Sylvia into a cardboard statue!How are the rangers going to defeat this monster and save Sylvia.Buy the movie to find out.
4,Great B2B reference for 2001,"This book is packed with information about the current state of B2B marketplaces. Raisch presents an evolutionary model of B2B markets. There are a large amount of errors and repetitive information. One could complain or be grateful that the book is interesting enough to overlook its shortcomings. The structure of the book and content are definitely worth these errors. This book is a good overview of B2B marketplaces from today's view. One could call it the B2B eCommerce ""Bible"" since it is presented more as a reference than an analysis. There is not a good indication of where some companies he references will be in the near future."
1,"Nice titles, low value","At a first look, this book appears to address all you would like to learn about B2B.However the actual content behind such interesting titles does not match the expectantions it raised to me: sometime it is very poor, sometime it is very generic or specifically related to a single software provider viewpoint (C1).It has been a wrong buy for me."
2,you get what you pay for.,My orange monster came in a random Seiko watch box (not original).The instruction manual was xerox copied and stapled together.The unidirectional bezel was very loose so i ended up returning the watch for a full refund.you get what you pay for.
2,Nice watch..lousy time piece,Recieved my Orange Monster Last September. I have worn it every day. I like the look and design of this watch but unfortunatly this watch does not keep very accurate time. Often losing about five minutes a week. I have friends who also own the Black Monster and anonther Orange monster and they have the same complaint.If I was to buy another watch I would not buy this Seiko again.
5,Orange Monster!!!,"Not much more I can say that haven't been said already, but I'll add a few of my observations anyway.-Love the drilled lugs. They make it sooooo much easier to change straps/bracelets.-Everything looks and feels like quality, especially for a $200 watch.-Love how the bezel feels. Never turned a bezel on a more expensive watch, but I don't see how it can feel much better.-Only timed it for one day and seemed to lose 1-2 seconds in just over a 24hr period.-Lume is awesome.A few gripes, not enough to take a way a star.-Not a neg, but I would rather the entire watch and bracelet be brushed.-Bezel and dial are off by a hair. You can even see it in the pic.I've been on a watch buying spree this year. Orient mako, Deep Blue AP Diver, Citizen NY2300, G-Shock (stormtooper mudman, dw5600, awg 101)and finally the Orange Monster. Other than the awg 101 which I wear at home and on weekends, this is my new favorite watch."
5,Excellent !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great looking Watch, night or day !!!!!!!!! Not heavy, just right !!!!!!!!!! Keeps great time !!!!!!!! Love it !!!!!!!!!! E"
2,Self winding design is very poor,This watch is self winding and won't last between wearings. It will only last about 24 hours after not having been worn before it stops completely and has to be reset. Very disapointing for a watch that cost as much as it did.
1,Bad watch,"I bought this self winding watch because I liked the color and that it was waterproof. But, it won't continue running. You have to sit there and continuously shake your arm to keep it running. It will literally quit running if you dont move your arm within seconds. Sent it back and glad its gone!"
1,Cheap piece of junk,"Fell apart right out of the box, looks and feels like a 20 dollar timex. Waste of time and money."
1,Watch is not OK.,"Watch is not OK.Seiko Monster must made in Japan. But your seiko monster made in Malaysia.Body and Machine is not strong.I'm unhappy.If possible, Could I get refund."
3,Nice watch - no link tool,"The watch itself is very nice, but it comes with no tools to shorten the band. I had to pay $15 at the Jeweler to get this done."
5,Orange you glad it's a MONSTER!!!,"I have the Black Monster and I just had to get the Orange Monster! The Seiko Monsters are truly the best value you can get in a dive watch. If you like big, heavy, macho, solid watches this is the one! Be careful though......it will increase your testosterone levels!!!"
2,Poor quality control,"I have had my Orange monster for 3 years and use it few times. It does not keep accurate time, it gains minutes a day no matter what. Also I can not set the watch accurately. The last postion of the stem, the hack setting does not work. Once I have worn the watch for a few hours the second hand will not stop when I pull on the stem. I even purchased an automatice winder to see if this would help, it did not. So for accurate time keeping and setting I have to wear one of my other watches. I do not expect the accuracy of a quartz movement, but minutes a day means I have to set it each day just to have a semblane of the correct time. I love the style, the face and the bracelet, but not the time keeping which is what I buy a watch for."
5,I really enjoy this watch,"I already have the Black Monster and like it. I bought the Orange monster because the day/date is Black print on white and easier to see. This watch is keeping perfect time, as opposed to the black face which picke up 1-2 minutes each day. I was resetting it 2-3 times a week. I knew this would probably occurr from other reviews I read on Amazon. I like the large watch, and both are quite rugged."
4,Orange Monster deluxe,The watch is great. The rubber wrist band is not an original Seiko product. The tools are nearly worthless. Shipping took nearly 2 weeks to arrive in NJ.
4,"Nice watch, works great, looks impressive",I bought this watch a month ago and am very impressed with it. It looks very stylish and works great. I saw a very similar seiko watch at the seiko store which didn't look half as impressive on hand and was twice the price. The dial is big and the chain is very good quality. The watch doesn;t lose time if left sitting for a day (or two) within a week.
4,seiko mmen's skx781,"Nice watch, except gains about 1 minute per week which isn't horrible for a self winding watch. This is in the range I expected. Good solid watch at a great price."
5,Mine is GREAT!,"Usually these run fast, sometimes VERY fast, but mine is great. It will lose about 5-10 seconds during the day & gain about 5-10 seconds at night. So... I'm always within 5-7 seconds at any given time. NOT the norm for a SEIKO."
5,Great Deal for the price!!!,I am a watch collector. It is better than some more expensive watches. It has a great look and feel. It is heavy but balances well on the arm. It is now one of my favorite watches. LOVE IT!!!!!!!
3,Tired of adjusting,It is a great looking watch wearing daily; however I am tired of fixing. It runs faster and I guess it needs some tune up.I am little disappointed about this model.
4,Love the Orange face,"Perfect leisure watch, even good for swimming, hels keeping it wound up.Easy to set both time and date, I would recommend this watch for sure"
4,Great looking watch,"Nice, heavy feel. Looks really sharp, gets lots of compliments.Cons... The day and date is hard to get set correctly. Seems to never work together and does not change around midnight at the next day, rather flips to the next day sometime around mid day. Example...today is Friday the 4th and it shows Friday the 3rd. Kinda frustrating"
4,Comprehensive,"While this book does not contain any new information about the Nag Hammadi texts not covered in other books, it does contain the whole story of their discovery in Egypt along with some of the more important gnostic myths. If you aren't familiar with Christian gnosticism, it is a great place to start your study. If you are, having both the discovery of the texts and a brief description of the gnostic belief system in one volume can be very useful."
4,A VERY NICE REMINDER,"This book is a collection of short pieces about different people and their experiences in time of war. I read five or six of the pieces in a dentist's waiting room this morning. I enjoyed the stories and found them inspiring as well as informative. I had not previously heard, for example, about the balloons that warships used to frustrate attacking fighter planes.The book was written as a reminder that religious faith is, and always has been, a powerful motivating force in the building and defending of this country. Such a reminder is made even more relevant today because of so many efforts to remove any reference to religion in the public forum."
5,Love this team of author/illustrator!,"We discovered this book at the library & took it out so much, we ended up buying our own board book version. It's very loved. Last night my 3 year old son woke up at 4am calling for his ""truck book!"" And he slept with his arms around it. The illustrations are so simple and clear, and the rhyming is very catchy. I do have to admit that while we like the other books by this pair (Trains, School, etc), this is the best & the favorite in our house."
5,"Perfect ""starter book"" for little truck lovers!","This book is a wonderful first truck book for little truck fans! My son's first word was truck. I bought this book when he was 18-months old. He is 3 1/2 now and still never tires of listening to the rhyming text and looking at the endearing pictures! It's great for Mommy, too, because it's so easy to read when you're tired, unlike a lot of the truck books that label the parts and have too much information for little ones. We also enjoy ""I Love Trains!"" by the same author."
5,I LOVE I LOVE TRUCKS!,"My 2 1/2 year old son is a huge truck fan. This book is great. I love the information on the front cover and first page, and back page and cover give. It's a bunch of facts that make the book that much more fun to read. The actual book is simple and easy to read. I can do ""short form"" by just reading the book, or I can do ""long form"" and go over all the trucks on the pages and covers. Whatever we do, we have a great time reading this together. What a great book!"
4,Just a few pages...,"...but each one cleverly illustrates types of trucks and vehicles in their settings. With primary color illustrations, this boardbook has friendly people figures and enough detail to keep a 6-18 month old intrigued. Perfect for introducing vocabulary and creating awareness about details in their context."

1,Este Literatillo Barato No Tiene Idea De Nada:,"Sobre todo de Escribir. Por lo menos Cualquiera que sepa leer lo sabria. Es paradojico, su arribismo no se compadece con sus composiciones de tan mal gusto, panfletarias, como de prensa amarillista. El clasico pasquin de una chismosa pueblerina que ha sido despreciada precisamente por lo que se considera la esencia del libro: la amistad. Pues de esto tampoco tiene ni idea. A Dios gracias, nunca he comprado un libro de este señor. ni lo voy a hacer. Simplemente lo lei por internet, mas por perder el tiempo que nada. Claro que hasta gratis sale caro. Asi que como va, nunca va a aprender a escribir, y menos, a ser amigo. Y solo se retrata a si mismo como alguien despreciable. Que mal gusto. Porque hasta para joder a los demas hay que tener estilo. Como dicen en Colombia: ""gañan""."
5,Excellent Camera,"This is a wonderful Camera that I have had for 4 years now. I have extremely enjoyed the quality pictures, and fun options that this camera has.I took several photography courses and this camera was leaps and bounds above what I needed.I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking into starting up or continuing photography as a hobby."
5,Excellent SLR for starters,I have owned this camera for the last 3 yrs. Not a single complaint so far. Most of the time I have used the auto settings even though it has a manual option. Excellent focus even in low light conditions and the focus lock is pretty fast. Yet to have a bad shot except for those occasional out of focus pictures which were mostly because of my fault.Operation is pretty simple and does not have much frills to worry about. Excellent value for the price
5,Best Stage Musical ever seen. Argentine Cast,"I've seen the stage musical twice (here in Buenos Aires, Argentina). I truely never seen anything like it. I even had moments of tears and all. Juan Rodo as the Beast has an incredible voice. Too bad, they haven't made a recording of this Argentine version. I bought the original Broadway version, but I must admit that, the Argentine version is even better. I truely recommend this CD."
5,Had what the movie was missing,"When I first heard that Disney was producing musicals, I thought they were crazy. I mean, this is not some show seen on a Disney World stage aimed at small children. This was a big budget musical aimed at adults here. I enjoyed the movie but I had serious doubts that a children's movie would attract adult viewers. My doubts were put to rest when the film was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. That was the first step in accepting Disney as a medium for everyone, not just children. Well, I bought the cast recording and I fell in love with it. The new songs were ones that yes, I could picture in the movie. They fit, they were not fillers. There is something about bring a film to the stage that gives it new life. Buy it, compare it, you'll love the story even more."
4,Good new songs added to the movie soundtrack,"I would recommend this CD if you are not so attached to the movie or the movie soundtrack. New songs like ""No Matter What"" ""Home"" or ""If I Can't Love Her"" add more depth to the characters' minds, which helps the story to go on naturally. I agree with other reviewers that the casting were not perfect, though. Susan Egan's Belle is well-performed from the point of her vocal technique, but sounds like a different character from Paige O'Hara's Belle--prissier and a bit less charming. Well, it is a good CD worth buying for musical and Disney lovers anyway. I am sure some of the melodies will never leave your brain!"
5,"great story, great music","I hate to admit it, but I used to abuse my CD's. I'm trying to change that though.Anyway, my first copy of this CD was SO scratched that I could only listen to a few of the songs without skipping, or some other such interferance.So, I decided to get another copy of this great show, and I realize I should have done so a few years ago.Now every time I listen to this, I just get swept up into the story and the music, and I don't have to worry about which songs I can listen to and how long I can a listen to a certain song before the skipping gets too bad.Absolutely wonderful."
4,Enjoyable,"It's a nice album with some beautiful songs, ideal for kids and young girls. If you've seen the movie or the show, you'll make it one of your favourite. The sound is flawless, so be sure your're getting a technically perfect recording"
5,Beauty and The beast.......,"What can i say to describe this hmmmm......................THE BEST CD OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It is defenetly worth the money! Susan Egan did a supurb jop as Belle, She(Susan Egan)added something to Belle that Paige O'Harra could not not to mentoin she(Susan)has a VERY wide range in her singing! Wich she show in ""home"". Terrance Mann did a wonderful Job as the Beast. His Voice is wonderful and you can tell what a good singer he is by listening to ""If I Cant Love Her"" beautiful! as form everyone else well..............They were all Great! i especily love how they exstended ""Be Our Guest"" , ""Gaston"" and Something there!worth every penny paid!"
3,i am pretty upset!,"ok, so i love beauty and the beast and broadway, but this cd makes me mad. it doesn't have the song ""A Change in Me"" that is from the broadway musical. and for the song ""Home,"" it doesn't have the lyrics from the show, it has the alternate lyrics that are meant to be used when you sing the song anywhere but the show. the lyrics that are written in the book that came with the cd are the musical lyrics, but she doens't sing them. it is an ok cd, but if you can find a better one, please get that one and don't make the same mistake i did!"
5,Beauty and the Beast the other beast,"I recently went to see Beauty and the Beast on broadway. I enjoyed the show on broadway very much, but it was the actor who play lumiere the talking candlestick who stole the show. the actors that played belle and the beast were superb as well. all i can say is that, this is a wonderful musical, and that we all have a kid within us that enjoys a moment like this. with all the musicals going on, with the exception of les miserables (which i have seen four times) which is closing next month, beauty and the beast had the longest line. the night that i went to see it, it played to a full house. even it was originally a kid's disney movie, this is one musical that the family can enjoy."
5,As Good As The Movie,Beauty and the Beast is one of the greatest Disney movies of all time. The tale told there is unmatchable. I loved the songs from the movie and I was not disappointed when I ordered the CD. The thing that surprised me most was how much the actors sounded like the actual cartoon version. Definitely money well spent.
3,Funked Out,"I own all three of the Pure Disco CDs. There were only two songs that really caught my attention and made me glad that I purchased it. I was pretty much funked out by the other two. They have most of the good songs on them. I wouldn't say not to buy it, I would just suggest finding the best bargain for it."
2,"The low point of the ""Pure Disco"" series","This disc is too spotty as a disco comp for me to consider it truly representative of the best music of the disco ball and platform shoes era. While the best material(""Le Freak"", ""Disco Inferno"",""Love Machine"",""In the Navy"",""Heart of Glass"") exemplify what this SHOULD be, other songs are either mediocre (""Get Up and Boogie"",""Could it Be Magic?""), or else not really representative of the disco era/sound. (""Ladies Night"" is NOT disco...even if it is a nice 'club' song. Neither is a REMIXED version of ""You're the One that I want""..which wasn't disco to begin with regardless of vintage.)I would say this is the nadir of the ""Pure Disco"" series..this one's only for diehards. (And if you're THAT into disco, Rhino has a good series you may prefer instead..7 CDs..called ""The Disco Years"" which goes beyond the huge hits and recalls some ones that are now forgotten..)2 1/2 stars"
4,Good.... but the first is the best,"Yep... it's a good CD but in my opinion, the first one in the trilogy is the best. Any way you will enjoy the tracks if you are a disco music fan. If you just are familiar with that kind of music, and about 30 years old, maybe you can find some unknown songs. It's a good selection."
4,Lot Of Great Music For Most Any Age Group,"As a Disco CD this far outranks the average assembly of hit singles. In my opinion, over two thirds of the list falls under the `Yes, these songs indeed represent what the disco era was about' category. Sure, 5 or 6 dupes did get included but no compilation ever completely tracks anybody's all-time favorites (unless maybe you're an Elvis fan whom has carefully scanned all 70 or so of his `originally arranged' Essential Greats). Anyway, `nuff of the analyzation. If you're alone thinking a boost could be in order, with your special mate or simply wish to get into a happy mood with a bunch of buddies then this CD definitely includes purpose for you..."
3,Close to perfect,"The series of disco album compilation that close to perfect if completed with the song "" Love is on the way by Sweet inspiration, Saturday Sunday Morning by Thelma Houston, Never gonna let you go by Band of Gold, Love is in the air , John Paul Young, Gonna get along without you by Viola wills, This is our time by Love Unlimited Orchestra and etc"
4,Cyclops 4000=tight mc.,seven eyes... is a tight album. Sir Menelik has a very tight flow. He spits verses like a serpent. Recommend for only true fans.
2,MENELIK-I EXPECTED MORE...,"SCARAMANGA'S FULL LENGTH IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN 70% OF ALL CURRENT HIP HOP, BUT THE ""HUMAN COMPUTER"" DEFINATELY WASN'T AT HIS BEST ON THIS RECORDING. MANY OF THE BEATS ARE RATHER DULL, HIS LYRICS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT UP TO POTENTIAL, AS EXHIBITED ON KOOL KEITH'S INDEPENDANT RELEASES. I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT THIS WAS A DISSAPPOINTING EFFORT, ONLY BECAUSE I EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE..."
3,"A little too lightweight, but okay","We bought the folding door to block off noise from the laundry room. It works pretty well for this. It was easy to install. The only issues we have are: 1. It doesn't fold up tight enough when open so the doorway is partly blocked. We solved that by holding it back with a small bungee cord. 2. It is very light weight plastic and when the furnace (in the laundry room) turns on when the door is in the closed position, the air intake sucks the door into the laundry room. The magnetic catch isn't strong enough to prevent it from being sucked in."
2,this product was delivered to me broken two times,It may have been the fault of UPS but this item came damaged twice. It is made of a flimsy material that easily cracks. I will not order it again.
2,Flimsey,"I thought maybe when I ordered it it was alittle more to it, like being more solid. It works fine but really wished it was more Solid."
1,Not useful,"Very hard to start and keep running even with premium gas. Very heavy for any extended use. If you still want it buy some quality ear and eye protection, as it is very loud. If you have electricity buy a quality electric. This thing finally wound up on the trash heap."
2,Dry and lacking any real substance...,"If you're looking for a good clothing history, don't bother with this book. Hollander's arguments are poorly written and unsupported. There's no evidence that she did any research."
1,IRON MAN AT HIS BEST !!!!!!.....,if you love the iron man comic books(new and old) this graphic novel is for you.this is not only a mini-series that shows how obsessed tony stark was about retrieving his stolen technology but it also shows (at least in my opinion)the closest tony ever got from going completely rogue.
2,shedding door mat,"I bought this rug because it is simple (i.e. no pattern), which is hard to find. Also, the rug is large which is nice since I use it as an entry rug in front of our front door. My major complaint, though, is that after wiping your shoes on the rug, the fibers of the rug track into the house. This may not be noticeable on carpet, but I have dark wood floors and the fibers make it look like it looks like I have a shedding Golden Retriever. So while the rug does help with not tracking dirt/mud into the house, I still have to sweep daily to clean up the ""hair""."
5,perfect episodes but they ended to quickly,"and i guess because they're so intense first at the beginning they're watching the news about the shredder going away and splinter talking to yoshi in ""ghost"" form and they start cheering because shredder's leaving earth BUT splinter said they have to stop him from leaving, because he'll terrorize the utroms. so they get leatherhead to cause a distraction and they climb to the top of the tower and attack shredder in his throne room. first splinter then michelangelo then raph,don and leo attack too and then shredder escapes to his rocket and...to be continued. then they attack him again and they almost get close to being killed but the utroms put shredder on trial and throw him in the sun."
1,Total Rip-Off,"This product is a total piece of garbage. The components are cheap inferior castings made in china. Mr. Flame says they are cast iron, but when mine started splitting apart it was obvious that they were pot metal. The components split apart spewing fine ash throughout the house as well as the potential for hot embers. The fan motor sounds like a Rolls Royce V12 airplane engine. Save your money and don't put your family in danger. It would be worth $500 to NOT have one of these things in your home."
2,Ghosts of their former selves,This is a lot of music for the money but because the tracks are all re-recordings - not at all satisfying. The originals are - after all these years - imprinted in my DNA. Lots of effort went into trying to re-create the original sound but for me it all falls flat.
1,Trash,Forever Soul R&B: This is one of the worst Cds I've ever listened to in my life. On a scale of 1-5 I'd give it a minus zero. Some of the songs sound like outtakes or alternate takes; Stand By Me by Ben E. King and A Rainy Night in Georgia by Brook Benton are just two examples. Instead of blowing your money on this rubbish give it to a homeless person or just set it on fire. I never write reviews but I've made an exception in this case. I feel like I've been robbed.
3,Items recieved,The cd came in case as advertised. The condition of the CD's was not as expected there were a few songs that can not play due to the cd's being scratched
3,Well-Illustrated Classic,"A faithful rendering of a classic story with artful decoration. Like most of the ""Jack"" stories, this story of cunning, belief in self, perseverence, duplicity, and violence evokes mixed feelings for adult readers. My young daughter loves the story and the pictures, but appeared to take the story too seriously at first. Now it's just another bedtime story with lovely pictures and a well-worn plotline."
2,Pictures too graphic and scary for young children!,I have two boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2. The pictures in this book are too graphic and scary for young children. I only read a few pages and put it away. My boys had no desire to look at this scary book. I was worried my children would have nightmares if I read the entire book to them. I plan on donating this book.
4,"Good story, but a little too scarey for small children","I originally brought this version of Jack and the Beanstalk home from the library to see if my 4 year old grandson would like it--he loved it so much I purchased it. This version is similar to the one I remember growing up with, however, when I read it to him I eliminate/improvise over the sentences that I think are way too scarey for a small child (eating boys on toast for breakfast, broiling calves, etc.). Even tho I think the illustrations can be a little frightening for smaller children, he doesn't seem to be bothered by them. And, all children love ""fee fi fo fum, etc."" and like to be scared just a little bit."
5,Wellllll... the giant looks like an ogre or a troll.,"I am picky about ""Jack and the Beanstalk."" I have read 8 or 9 versions of the story to my children, and this one is pretty good. The story is the familiar story without any surprises. Steven Kellogg's style of illustrations is great for younger readers. I have a family of boys, and the little ones like Steven Kellogg's style very well.Some of the illustrations are extremely good - the beanstalk growing, and the castle at the top. But the giant's wife looks like a voodoo priestess, and the giant looks like Grendel. I would honestly give this book 4-and-a-half stars, but that's not possible.Still, this book tells the classic fairy tale well, and it's an important story about taking risks and being persuasive. Boys need Jack.(What is your favorite version of ""Jack and the Beanstalk?"" Ours is by John Howe.)"
2,too dark and sary for my toddler,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter did not like this book at all. We read it once together and after that I could tell this is her least favorite book in her collection. Everytime I grab it she says no and grabs another one. She didnt say it but I think the graphics might be too dark and scary for her.I returned it and bought Jack & the Beanstalk by Richard Walker and Niamh Sharkey. She like this version much, much better."
2,Fairytales,"I know that fairytales have there scary elements, but the illustrations in this version of Jack and the Beanstalk were down right creepy. The text is fine, just don't care for the pictures."
4,Book Children,It's a great book but when it arrived it was damaged- They provided prompt responses in the return and refund of the book. They were a good company to work with
5,An Old Classic That Still Has Its Magic,I love the old fairytales that are still around. The old stories are read and reread. It is a magical time in childhood that is always fresh in our minds. All some of the old favorites to your library.
5,Attention: Book Clubs,"Papaya Myths is a must-read. This hard-to-put-down novel has a multi-faceted protagonist who is not what she appears to be.Papaya Myths is a thought-provoking book which will provide book clubs with many interesting and heated discussions as the members delve into the motives and actions of the charactersMs. Scott has extraordinary insight into the emotions of her characters and ""what makes them tick"" and the events of the time.Highly recommended."
1,bottles are not clear,"The bottles I got were larger than the image and had large tacky scissor patterns on them. I guess I wouldn't care if I were planning on using them at a salon, but that is not the case. I ended up giving them away because I needed clear ones."
2,Not as described,"The bottles work fine, but they are certainly not clear and look nothing like the product pictured. The bottles I received are more opaque, taller, have a black top/spray nozzle and have scissors printed all around the bottle. One of the main reasons I chose these spray bottles was that they were described as clear and pictured as such. Not so. Pretty disappointing. The design does not scratch off and takes more than one layer of paint to cover. As I am just using these in my home, it is not critical that the bottles are clear, but if I had purchased them for business, they would have not been usable."
2,Stopped working after a while,I loved them at first. I bought them because I'm deployed and needed bottles to use for the communal showers. After about a month or so of use the spray handle depresses and you can't use it. Not sure if it's the bleach/water used or it's just a cheap product.
1,Crap!,These bottles are cheap and thin. I've tried to use 2 of them so far and both of the bottles broke by the threads when I had the sprayer screwed on. This happened the first day I tried using them. I'm just going to trash the other 4 bottles since when the bottles crack the sprayer is still in your hand and the bottle falls to the ground spilling its contents creating a big mess.
4,Pretty ill for a first dealt EP,"Probably more like a 3.5, but Inspectah Deck, Apathy, and Virtuoso pick up the game on this C.d. a little bit. If you like 7LES how they USED to be, cop this and Soul Purpose, but i'm sure ppl who liked how they used to be already knew that. Peace."
4,Great stuff,"I love essential oils! I bought this to add to my dr. bronner's castille soap. Just a few drops in the small container makes for a nice, cleansing soap. The smell is, of course, medicinal, but so is all other tea tree oils. I will be purchasing this again, great product!"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"This book was forced on me in a political science class. If you love left-wing propaganda and dogmatic party-line thinking, you'll love this book. It's filled with half-truths, opinions stated as facts, and outright lies. By the end I felt physically ill. You won't find solutions in this book for the problem of blacks committing the majority of crime in America, only pathetic excuses. The author also dismissed a priori the idea that poverty does not necessarily lead to crime, rather a third factor may lead to both regardless of race: low I.Q. (p. 134) (The Bell Curve). The author shows his elitist attitude when he characterizes the electorate as dupes (p. 179) and advocates punishing law abiding gun owners (p. 200) because of the actions of criminals.... truly frightening and an excellent example of left-wing authoritarianism"
5,Simple and effective.,"I like knowing the albums I listen to had thought put into the lyrics as well as the music, with Ian involved it's always the case that the words sung/screamed will strike a chord with me. The music here is obviously more mellow than Ian's old bands, Amy's past bands were also more aggressive, but that fact does nothing to take away from the enjoyment of The Evens. I wouldn't let the absence of a distorted guitar keep me from listening.Listen to the samples and judge for yourself, it's great and fun to listen to. Ian's guitar playing, while not a maestro, is more than enough to stay interesting and Amy does something that most drummers do not, she makes them instruments and not just time keeping objects. Rarely do I listen to a group where the drum beat steals my attention away from what the guitar or bass is doing, she's really amazing."
3,Ultimately Doesn't Work...,"I'm a huge fan of the Spinanes, a Portland drum-and-guitar band that put out some of the melancholy and beautiful pop music ever.I was looking for a similar revelation from this album, but the truth is that this style is not right for Ian MacKaye. He doesn't have the vocal range to carry the minimal songs and his shouting and blunt lyrics don't translate well. I like the songs that feature the female singler a lot more, especially the one great and one very good song on the album: 'Around the Corner' and 'If It's Water' respectively.If you are a fan of Fugazi you'll probably like this, but if you are looking for a really great band in this minimal style, try the Spinanes."
4,"Minimal, Postmodern, Proactive, Detextulization","Hey,I saw the Evens in concert here in my home town of Ventura at the Legion Hall, which if you go there you'll see how small and intimate a setting it is for a concert. I have seen Fugazi 4 times in my life from '92 to more recently and they're one of my all time favorite bands. The Evens were great in concert, but like another reviewer said, they miss with the slower songs, of course these are just opinions. I was so excited to get the album and listen to it right away, but it's hard to get into, try as I might... I think for people who have shared the ride of the history of discord and related people's careers and the scene of it all in general it a no-brainer to buy this, but for people looking for something new, I would suggest that, without a doubt, buy a Fugazi album first, of which I would sugguest ""Repeater"" (what a great album). Take care everyone, hope life is going well for all of us."
3,Conventional,"Fugazi had a sound all its own, but this is more conventional slow guy/girl indie rock. Of course, with Ian at the helm, it's a lot tighter, and the instrumentation has a little of that Fugazi sound a'la the slower tracks on Red Medecine. This sounds pretty much like a million other bands have been sounding since 1995. I mrean, it's better than 90% of those bands. But it all sounds a little dated."
1,Stick with Fugazi,"This chick's voice is really annoying. It's like what would happen if Fugazi and The Indigo Girls got together. Not a pretty thought, eh? The songs where Ian does all the singing are ok, but still not up to snuff with lesser Fugazi tracks. Pretty forgetable... and once she starts singing, forget about it."
3,Interesting new path,"Let me commence by saying that Fugazi is my favorite all time group. Now one of the key reasons this is true is their feel for sound structure and drum beats. It's the little things that make thier songs great. The same thing is present here, in a different package, but very interesting drums, with mellower songwriting from Mr MacKaye, and although I'm not familiar with the Warmers, and not entirely in love with her voice, it's not as (annoying) as others have portrayed it to be. My favorite tracks are Blessed not Lucky and Around the Corner. Nice album, worth 3 1/2 stars."
1,Not critiqueing the actual movie,"Sadly this film was zoned for USA and Canada only an therefore would not play in Australia. However, I have seen the film itself and it was great!"
1,It's a cartoon but it's too scary for kids.,The movie has evil rabbits killing eachother that's not a good message for kids.
1,"Forget it, a horribly violent movie with no redeeming value..","I saw this movie after being told by a co worker how great it was. I was not impressed, in fact I hated this movie more than any I had ever seen.Unless you like violence just for the sake of it, forget it."
5,Great movie,"Santa brought this for my daughter who repeatedly rented it and put it on her Christmas list. All 3 of our girls (ages 5, 9 and 11) love this movie. Yes, it is graphic at times but it's animated and the children understand that biting and scratching is animal behavior. I have heard the three of them discuss the plot and they ""get it"" - it's supposed to represent human interaction, both good and bad. If you have not read the book or seen the movie I suggest renting it first because it is NOT a fuzzy bunny movie. It IS a classic story and we're glad to add it to our collection. The music is also fantastic. The best part was the way the movie prompted our 9-yr old to read the book. She didn't get through the whole thing but it certainly pushed her to read at a level she hadn't previously attempted."
4,A good watch.,"This isn't a classic, this isn't then end all and say all of movies. It IS a fine adpation of an even better novel. The plot of a group of rabbits seeking a better life brings to mind the very funny CHICKEN RUN but is not of course played for laughs. (Some few are provided by Zero Mostel as Keharr in his final film role.) The slight difference in plot (the only doe of the group killed during the trip in the movie VS no does at all.) add to the film. Good performances all around that the animation is well drawn, (although the firth scenes aren't my style.) A good companion to the novel and a clean and thoughtful movie for the kiddies"
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"When I was very young, perhaps 3 or 4, I saw this movie and I cried in fear and sorrow, yet I kept returning to it. It was mezmerizingly beautiful, with animation that captured the essence of the stories and visions. Simple, bright, what really struck me was how closely the animated legends resembled thought, that they seemed as natural as thinking. I had many eerie, wonderful dreams of rabbits dancing in the sun. All the visual peotry captured me far more than any Disney kiddie flick with caricatured animals, and I became very thoughtful and insightful. At such a young age, whatever I saw made a huge impression on the rest of my life, and I think ""Watership Down"" set me on the track to where I am today."
5,An animation calssic !!!!,"An amazing story thats haunting, beautiful and mysterious. I recommend this animated story for children and adults. Its timeless and smart. Animation thats excellent with a story that is in my opinion a masterpiece. An animation classic !!!"
5,Astounding!,"I read the book before I saw the movie, and it was fairly accurate, which is more than I can say about most movies based on books. I love this movie and reccomend it to anyone, all ages. Scratch that- it has a little violence, but nothing much, and it's just so well done! A few words in the movie are spoken in Rabbit, so if you want to know what they mean you have to buy the book- which you should do anyway!"
4,"excellent film, NOT FOR CHILDREN!","Don't let the description of 'rabbit adventures' fool you, this is *not* a children's film. The adventures are not simply about bunnies, but is rife with rich metaphors and includes a clairvoyant rabbit who predicts a foreboding future for the rabbit civilization. Don't get me wrong, there are some more lighthearted sections. . . including a laughable sea gull. Beautifully created in the style of dark water colors, the animation provides well-done interpretation of the book. It's one of my favorite films, but almost terrifying and very engrossing for most adults, my friend saw it when she was a kid though. . . One animated scene alluding to death is accompanied by a beautiful song by Art Garfunkel called 'Sad Eyes', my friend cried (so did i). The introductory fable scene is neat, too. Many thanks to my High School friend Nathan who introduced it to me."
5,Animated classic,"A simply awesome animated film based on Richard Adams's great novel in which the lifes of rabbits are used as an allegory for Human society, Watership Down tells the tale of a group of rabbits who's home is about to be detroyed and how they must find a new place safe from their enemies. They eventually find a new place, but there are no female rabbits to start a new burrow. So, the rabbits go out in search for females and end up having to fight the dictatorial, rabbit General Woundwort (voiced by Harry Andrews). This is probably one of the best animated film ever made. Both adults and children will enjoy this. The comic relief is provided by comedian Zero Mostel (in his last role), as the voice of the looney Seagull, Kehaar. The film is full of famed British stars, doing the voices of various characters, amongst them John Hurt, Denholm Elliot and Ralph Richardson.Watership Down is a great film that should endure for a very long time."
5,A wonderful classic movie to remember for life!,"I always loved this movie and I will love it again when I buy it. The first time I saw the movie when I was between the ages of 8 and 12. I love this movie because it's a classic. Me and my sister always watched it all the time. My mom threw it out because it was voilence. Well, the movie ISN""T suitable for children as other reviewers of the movie said. It's for more of a mature age group that can see the movie. Probably you would have to be atleast 10 and older to see it. Maybe 9. It does have some blood in it but still it's a classic. It's a memoriable movie to remeber for generations and generations. I also love cartoons and that is part of why I love this movie. I grew up with cartoons and still watchin' cartoons! If you love cartoons and can handle a little blood and love classic movies like this, then you will love Watership Down!"
4,Any cartoonist would like it!,"Hi, I want to be a cartoonist and this is my childhood favorite movie, Watership Down. I seen it when I was a kid atleast when I was probably atleast ten. Now I am 16 and I still like it. I hope to get the movie for myself. The book is good but I would watch the movie before I read the book because it's kinda confusing and I can picture it in my mind better with the movie! I also found in a article that mostly people with a cartoon taste would like it. You got drama, music, sadness, friendship and care! Sure it got lots of blood but it's nature! I am a nature type person and I love cartoons! If you love cartoons and nature, I can assure you, will love this movie!"
2,movie ain't the book,"I saw the movie after reading the novel and falling deeply in love with the characters. I searched the net and found that there was in fact a movie and searched for it in all the video stores near my house. When I watched the movie I was impressed by the realistic quality the rabbits are given but disapointed by the butchered story line. I would still recommend this movie to any true lover of the great novel, for the sheer joy of watching characters come to life on screen rather than in ones mind. I only wish a true longer version will come out one day using all that movie magic has to offer."
1,Expected better Quality,"Had seen this movie a long time ago it's different and very good. Was excited when I received the DVD. When I finally got to watch it about 2/3rds into the movie the picture froze then came back again it froze a while later then it came back on, this continued for a while till finally got through the bad spot. I expected and purchased new quality but aparently got used quality."
3,"pretty good, a little","If you have not read the book yet, and want to know wether it's good or not, see this movie, unlike some movies based on books, this is alot like the book! in fact, it is simply a version of the book without all the unneccesary descriptions, poetry, writing of things that had nothing to do with the story, description of rabbit's mating habits and passing of droppings, and other things that made reading WD just a little unpleasant. So if you like the movie a little and want more, then read the book."
1,DVD will not play in the USA area,"MovieMars sold me a DVD for region 2...in other words this DVD cannot play in the USA...only on the other side of the world. My mailing address is in the United States so I thought it was pretty rotten that they sent me a DVD that can play only in Europe, Arabia, Japan and South Africa. Their advertisment on Amazon did not indicate that this was a region 2 DVD; the ad made no reference to the region."
1,"If you love your kids, keep this far far away","Let me explain something. This movie is the scariest damn movie ever. Bunnies trying to claw each other's eyes out is not cool. happy bunny blood, people. Am I the only one horrified by this? HAPPY. BUNNY. BLOOD. To whoever was behind this: What the hell is wrong with you? Music by Art Garfunkel."
3,"Not a movie for *all* kids, but a wonderful film","Watching this movie is one of my earliest memories, probably when I was 4 or 5 or so. Honestly it stuck with me because it didn't dance around the dark things. Don't get me wrong, I watched my share of My Little Pony and Care Bears, but this movie, as well as The Mouse and his Child, The Last Unicorn, and a very accurate animated portrayal of Black Beauty (also quite dark stories) were the movies I always got again and again from the video store. Each child may be different, so gauge based on their maturity and comfort level, otherwise you may be dumbing things down needlessly.My lower star rating of this DVD is not based on the film, which I love, but the transfer. I own an older edition of the DVD with superior sound and video, despite the bargain basement cardboard-flap case and bad cover art.The film will never be the book, but it was just as wonderful as I remembered, which often can't be said of things I enjoyed in the 80's ^_^."
5,Watership Down Changed My Life,This book works on every metaphorical level. It is a masterpiece for anyone to have written.
5,An Enchanting and Beautiful Story,"The powerful story of a group of determined rabbits searching for a safer warren is compiled into a stunning watercolor and raises questions about life. I am only 12, but the startling reality of the rabbits troubles- from leaving their warren based on information from a young, unimportant rabbit, to finding out the truth about another warren that has made a sickening pact with man, this movie has it all. The book has so much more details- but it is quite a long book- I really believe that this movie was well done, and is a wonderful video to see."
4,Wound tight,"One of the better modern hard-bop tributes, this is an exquisitely balanced, thoughtfully blown compilation which would definitively announce Marsalis's genius to traditionalists and experimenters alike."
4,Wynton's warmest recording,"Wynton really hit his stride on this work as far as his tone and emotive expression were concerned .Although I admit to losing intrest in him since then. The problem with Wynton's generation is the lack of compositional originality and the fact no Monk's or Shorter's out are out there.When somebody comes out that can compose, I will start listening again."
4,An Excellent Introduction to Jazz,"I have been an avid jazz listener for some time, and have kept track of Mr. Marsalis' carrer. I believe that this is an exceptionally accessable CD for those who are not musicians and want to learn about jazz. Far from the Free Jazz of the 60s, but evolved from the bebop era, this CDs created a time and place in my life that did not let me stop listening--even though I am not a musician."
4,Hooked on Lambert & Hook,"This is a series I like - good writing, strong character development, fairly believable plot lines. This particular one wasn't the best but was still satisfying."
2,"Great if you are in England, I guess?","I thought this would be useful to my new staff. However, the book contains only information about British Court, procedures, forms....My Secretary is confused enough most of the time.The last thing we need is a guidebook with the caveat ""That's kinda like what we do , but with a slightly different name.""The description contained a , somewhat cryptic, clue that the emphasis might be London, but it should have been explicit, unless they are trying to sell books that are useless to Americans to Americans."
3,baghead,"I was always interested in this movie. It looked like crap and in a way it was so yay for buying it at a cheap price. It got a little boring during the film and the acting was as real as it could get. I thought the idea of the film was neat but with more of a budget, it might have made a great horror film."
3,Highly entertaining for low budget,"I happen to have a very soft spot for low budget horror. To me, there's something undeniably appealing about a cast I've never seen before (and hence have not developed any preconceived notions that may inhibit my ability to enjoy a particular character), as well as a low tech approach to creating horror. They also tend to be gimmick free, or at least less full of distracting gimmicks. All the above are true in this film. Additionally, the concept is a fun one. Its not necessarily a full novel concept, but its nonetheless entertaining with an at least good enough acting cast, a decent script, and decent camera work. Fully recommended at least as a rental."
2,with exception of Greta Gerwig,the realism was a plus and so was Greta Gerwig -- other than that the story coulda used some punch-up to make it more interesting
2,Loved the idea,"Even as I was taking the tripod out of the package I was having problems. The legs were already starting to come out of the sockets just bending it around trying to straiten them, (It comes wrapped around some plastic pieces in the package to show the concept). My camera is a Canon Powershot S3 I1 that ways in at around 14.5 oz. the tripod could not hold it. While I had it sitting on my table, at least one of the legs would start sliding out causing it to fall. Also I could not get the tripod to successfully hold in place on the top rail of a chain link fence, even while using one of the legs as a support against a post. I even tried to wrap it around just the post itself with no luck. I really loved the idea of not needing a flat surface to use this portable tripod, but my experience is that they need to make some major improvements."
3,"Worked well for a while, then fell apart. The replacement was a big negative.","I got this as a gift and was very excited about it. We used it occasionally and it held up pretty well at first, though the lock ring at the top broke off quickly (but seemed unnecessary so it didn't matter). It held our smallish camcorder with no problems, and was very useful for wrapping around stuff. About three weeks into a month long trip of constant use one of the legs fell off. The plastic had sheared at the top of the leg, so there was no way to reattach it. We didn't do anything violent or forceful to the tripod, it just failed. I called the company and they're going to send me a free replacement when I send back the broken pod. I'm happy with the customer service, but I'd hesitate before buying another one of these.Update: The company has continued to be very helpful, and we've gone through two more of these with the same problem--the legs just keep falling off! I would not buy one of these again."
2,Dissapointed with FEIN quality hype,"I bought this RT1800 when I was looking for a very high quality router I could own for a very long time, I saw the info in the RT1800 and I was impressed, light weight, soft start, 3 1/4 hp etc.. when I received it it was just very dissapointing. The vacuum attatchment was very flimsy, thin, brittle plastic and mounted where it would certainly fail. It only took one time for me to put it down and CRACK! went the vacuum attatchment. The height ajdustment knob has a lot of play, and was cracked on mine but still stayed on. The Plunge action works great If you are a heavy weight lifter and put alot of effort, the springs they use I think are meant for holding up a car. Overall I don't like it, the only thing it has going for it is that you can remove the bits with one wrench. My recommendation is go with porter cable, I will be tossing my Fein in the retired tool bag and it hardly used."
1,I got the lemon,"I bought this router because of the power and wide base to accept larger bits. Weight and balance seemed very good at the store. I was like a kid bringing a puppy home. Imagine when the puppy dies 2 minutes after you start playing with it.I never made a single cut with it. All the sparks shooting out of the housing combined with the burning smell made it hard to concentrate on cutting.When a store that sells you something at the M.S.R.P. takes it back without offering to exchange it, you really wonder.I eventually decided on the PC 7518 fixed base. I only wanted a new 3 1/4 horse router for large bits (rail & stile, lock miter, etc.) so I really didn't need a plunge. That PC is the finest router I have ever used. Thus, I am glad I was the one that did not get Fein's finest!!"
3,"Good router, but not that exciting","For $300, i expected the mother of all routers. Guess what, it's just another router. It has basically the same design as every other plunge router i've seen, with above average execution. Good, not great."
4,old but great,The Norton AntiVirus 2206 helped us big time at our family owned travel agency. We had an employee who had brought her 'too knowledgeable' 10 year old son to the office and he opened a few sites that infected a computer that was older yet functioning fine until that day. The product worked wonders and the desktop is running better than before. Thanks!
3,Moderate Performance,I think it is good for organizing insulin and needles. It keeps reasonable temp for few hours in warm weather. Because I live by the seaside I noticed a considerable condensation around the ice bags so make sure you don't keep important printed material in contact with it.
3,it's over before it begins,"""Sounds Of The Inner City"" clocks in at just under 29 minutes. It's just an attempt to cash in on Booker Little. Since Little's career was brief, any recordings featuring him are of interest, but this title isn't one I'd pick up first--or even second. Ervin contributes some fluid sax, but these aren't his best performances. Sound quality is OK for the early 1960s.A far better choice is Lonehill Jazz LHJ10180 ""Booker Little Featuring George Coleman Complete Recordings."" It's another in Lonehill Jazz's excellent 2fer reissue series and finds Little fronting bands including marquee players like Max Roach, Tommy Flanagan, and Reggie Workman."
5,Similar to Mario Kart,This was a fun game. I haven't played it too much but it has been fun and is similar to Mario Kart.
3,game cd,We have had this for a while and were not very happy with it. We decided to sell it. Pac man rules but not this one.
3,Good Pamphlet,"I used to have to read this kind of stuff in college. I had one professor who was an acknowledged Marxist and he liked to have his students read things like this. It was, therefore, nothing unusual or hard for me to understand. It's not for everybody. It's not even for me very much but I enjoyed the trip back in time."
2,Bad translation? This isn't readable at all.,"I'm not sure if the translation is confusing, or the ideas being presented are confusing, or both. But this philosophical book is a lot of words written without saying much. I'm writing this because I purchased the book after reading the 17 reviewers who rated this book five stars. I was looking forward to an excellent treatise.But instead I found the ideas confusing and random. It was difficult todetermine exactly was being presented.I did like the Euclidean/Tractatus numbering system for the propositions.But the ideas in those propositions weren't clearly written or easily understood by me.To give you some background on me, I'm no fan of Hegel.Ernest Becker's works give me a lot of insight, as do Nietzsche's.I think this book assumes the reader is well-versed in Hegelian thought.Maybe the reader needs to complete the Phenomenology of Mind before this work is accessible."
1,"Great Book, Bad Translation","This is an awful, reductive and artless translation of Guy Debord's ""Society of the Spectacle."" It appears to be a translation for ""dummys,"" which I assume would have Debord spinning in his grave.There are free PDFs of a better translation of this book ALL OVER the internet. It's a tremendously wonderful book, but this translation just doesn't do it justice. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Not a clear translation,"I am not one to avoid complex writing that involves reading and re-reading to comprehend the meaning of the text, but this translation is less than ideal. I found another one online that is actually easy to read. The book itself is a worthwhile read, but I suggest that THIS particular translation requires too much work to comprehend."
5,One of the most important and most overlooked philosophical texts of the 20th century,"My title says it all.If you have any interest in understanding the modern system (correctly termed the ""spectacle-commodity system"" by Debord) read this.Debord's ""Comments on the Society of the Spectacle,"" written 20 years later, is also excellent and might even be a better starting point. It is less dense and more succinct."
4,Worth every dime,"This book is full of good information, and some new perspectives on old themes. I would recommend the book to anyone starting an event or seeking sponsorship for an existing event. Every sponsor seeker should have this book in their library and read it every year or two."
1,Give me a break on the title,"I was watching Chubby Checker on the Tom Snyder show when he was promoting this cd. He spent about 10 minutes gong on and on about how he is so much more than just ""The Twist"" and that he needs to get away fro being type casted as an artsit because of the Twist. He then said he had a new Country music cd out and Snyder said oh yeah what's it called and when Chubby said ""the Texas Twist"" I about died laughing. Seriously, the Texas Twist, after trying to not be associated with only the Twist. Even Texas Twister when have been bad. He said it with a straight face too and was very serious about it, that made it even funnier."
1,Save Your Money,"I got this CD as a ""gift"" from Providian (or Bank of America). It is truly the absolute worst Chubby Checker music ever. There's no particular theme, his voice is bad. it's neither country nor early rock, just some mish-mash. The only thing I can think is that he owed some money on his Visa and this was part of his settlement, like Willie Nelson and the IRS Tapes. Either way, I'd never, ever, ever, recommend anyone buy this CD."
2,Misleading description,"If you're expecting a real wood headboard, this is not the one to buy. It is described as 'wood with pine finish'. A more accurate description would be 'particle board with pine laminate'. It also says it is 2 inches thick. Not true! The headboard itself is less than 3/4 inch thick, and just under 1.5 inches at the points where the particle board legs are attached. Also has residual chemical smell."
2,Not real wood,I would have given it 3 star if it's not misleading in product description. And I did not expect it come with a good workmanship at the price.
4,Queen-size Headboard,"I was pleasantly surprised by the fine look of the headboard when it arrived. It's hard to believe that something so inexpensive could look this nice. Assembly was easy, and took only a few minutes."
2,Don't do it!!,"I have recently purchased several items, online, that needed assembly. This headboard is by far the poorest quality and workmanship i have come across. It took forever to arrive, the smell of glue is nauseating, the finish shows poor workmanship, and the screws don't line up with the holes. The cheap price should have been the give away. It's true, you get what you pay for!! I now have to keep it, the shipping was almost as much as the headboard and i've already given my old one away. Don't make the same mistake i did."
4,Guest room headboard,The headboard came very well package but still managed to get a dent in edge. Lucky for me it was in the back side of the headboard. Good headboard for the price. I am using for a guest room and looks cute.
5,the best conditioner for japanese straightened hair,"I get my hair japanese straightened/thermal reconditioned, and this stuff is amazing. I switched to a regular conditioner not long ago and my hair just didn't feel the same.. this is the BEST conditioner on the market. It's pricey, but worth the expense in my opinion. I will continue to buy!"
5,Life Saver!,This is a terrific conditioner. My hair is fine and is very dry. I use this product once or twice a week and it literally REBOOTS my hair. Makes it shiny and silky and very managable. I can't live without it!
4,A classic fairtale...,"Anne Logston has the ability to pull the heartstrings and tell a good story at the same time. In this book, which is based off of the world she created in the Shadow series, Chyrie is an elf caught in the middle of a war/invasion she doesn't understand. The book is written in such a way and is short enough that is creates the feeling of being around a campfire telling fantasy stories. I must say that I enjoyed Greendaughter, and if you have read any of Logstons previous books and enjoyed them, then you will not be disappointed with this one."
3,winning spirtual Warfare,I like the book everyone should read about spirtual warfare if you dont the devil will play you like a fiddle. Dont give him the upper hand. If your saved he will mess with you or your family. Stayed prayed up and read read read.
5,Winning Spiritual Warfare,"Simple and life changing. Affordable. Be free and walk into His light,He's been waiting to deliver you for so long. Really feel what it's like to be the person He created you to be."
4,"Very good, but old","This is a good review of parrots as of around 1960. If you are interested in what their original distribution was, this is a great book. If you want to know what species are endangered now, this isn't the place to look.The text and illustrations are generally good, with references to original sources (albeit old ones). Age also explains the dearth of information about breeding and behavior for many species"
3,Touching but Out of Touch,"Many readers will think this book is a beautiful fable. Perhaps they are right, and perhaps I am too literal a reader, but I have difficulty being charmed by a novel in which nobody can be both content and alive. Mr. Sobin writes very well (if somewhat repetitiously--he becomes attached to certain adjectives and then uses them endlessly), and his use of Old Provencal is fascinating, but the book left me with a hangover. It was an intoxicating experience, but one that lingered in unpleasant ways."
4,Nice bag for the price,"Can't add much to what's been reviewed, except it would be nice to have a second zippered pocket on the other side of the bag. Then you would have a five star bag."
4,Works Fine-weird zipper,"Great product. . . minus one star for the weird double zipper that makes it a little awkward to open and close the case. When hiking, I always wondered if I had completely closed the zipper/velcro flaps. Fit my vixia hfs10/extra batteries/connecting cable/power adapter and even the manual."
5,You could fit two FS10 Camcorders int it,"The product photo Amazon provides can be kinda deceiving. It shows a camcorder in the bag and you assume that the camcorder takes up most of the space in the bag. When in fact, I could fit two of my Canon FS10 Camcorders inside it with room still leftover on the side pouches for the AC Adapter, rechargeable battery, and memory card. Regardless, the thing is light and does what it's supposed to. No issues thus far"
4,Great little bag.,"This camera case works very well with my Canon HF S100. It has adequate padding and compartments for additional gear. If anything, the case is a bit bigger than it needs to be, but that is not a bad thing."
2,Maternal Child Nursing Text,"This text is not only hard to find information you need, some of the chapters are hard to follow and read. The illustrations are good but information can be hard to come by. And talk about typos! Someone needs to proof read this text before it goes to the printer the next time.Overall I think two stars is being very generous.I am sure there is a better text to pick from."
2,okay textbook,"Mostly general information. I had a hard time finding some of the information that I needed. Honestly, I don't feel like I have gained a whole lot of studying out of this text. Some of the chapters were hard to understand."
4,This book is great!,This book is an excellent tool for Maternal Child. I highly recommend it. It is well organized and well written. I didn't feel the need to use outside sources to supplement my information. It was all right there. The case studies and the Care Plans help to bring the abstract into focus. I really enjoyed this book.
1,Not pleased,"I never received this item and I purchased it a month ago. I emailed the seller a couple of times and did not receive a response, and I had already paid for the item and needed it for school. This whole experience was awful and I wouldn't recommend purchasing from anyone without checking all their feedback. Amazon did say that I would get a refund, but I have yet to receive it."
1,rating five star,"Iloved the book. Just saw the play. Now I""m passing the book around to friends. Will plan to order more books."
4,Incredible!,"The music is amazing, the book is incredible, the story is haunting; these are all things credited to make this musical spectacular. Sweeny Todd tells the story of revenge, love, death, and ofcoarse pies. Sweeny Todd is a Barber who seeks revenge on all man kind. Mrs Lovett is his assistant who hides the evidence, in her delicious meat pies. ""Have you seen the Priest?"" asked the Judge. ""No, I havent."" replied the Beadle Bamford smaking his lips. ""By the way judge have you tasted this delicious PRIEST PIE."""
5,So good,"This cd is SO much better and very different from their first two cd's. This is a lot ""poppier"" than S.K.'s previous offerings, and this is the type of music they were meant to perform. This cd will grow on you, and never let you down. Get it."
5,Awesome...!!!,"I bought it to replace my lost CD. I loved it from the beginning, and surprise that hard to find it again in the market.This is their greatest album, I may say. ""Field of rape','(david bowie) space oddity','I love you','On and On' still thrill me... Jason is awesome."
4,fun fun fun,"Margaret cho is always funny, she makes the weirdest and funniest faces and the show is well paced. I really enjoyed watching it"
4,I got into Margaret Cho because of this...,"When All American Girl first came on TV, I was so excited because - FINALLY - a TV show about how insane Asian families can be!While many Asian Americans protested this show, due to the cast not being completely Korean, and that the show played up certain Asian stereotypes, it also showed how tough it is, growing up between two cultures.While Margaret Cho's comedy routine is vastly superior to this show (her impressions of her mom are hysterical! She sounds just like my mom!), this series was great, and I was very distraught when it was cancelled."
2,Questionable Quality,"It appears that the copy I received did not have the electronic trademark controls removed, as if it were an illegal copy. I not sure about that, but the copying job seemed amaturish with pictal breakdown and a vertical band running through the copy. It became better when I used another player program."
1,what was I thinking?,"I dont know,,, I remember loving this show when it was on TV. Margaret Cho is one of my favorite comedians. I was so excited when I found the complete series. Well, man oh man what a disappointment.BORING!!!!!! poor story lines, silly jokes,,,bad acting, except for amy hill who is brilliant (compared to the rest of the cast)I mean Its got its moments but honestly its pretty bad. Maybe in the 80s it was funnier, but now........no."
5,awesome,"very funny dvd, well worth the buy. Margaret Cho does a great job in this. It made me laugh a lot."
4,All american girl - the complete series,"When All American Girl was first shown in Austrlia is was at 11:30pm and it was often missed, rescheduled for not shown. Seeing the complete series brought back great memories and also showed that the scope of this show was not only funny but also a real sign of the times. The only let-down to the DVD is the extra interview at the end, it went on for too long and said a nothing about the show. Great 90's flashback TV"
1,A sure headache creator,"Don't go for it.Everybody whoever is going to buy this album need to make sure what exactly he is going to have instead of looking at overall reviews/rating and purchasing on pulse.This album is full of heavy western metallic music which is sure recipes for headache. All the tracks are almost monotonous and sound like each other. No variety of instruments either. If your ears are for heavy metallic western music then you probably can give it a try. On the other hand if you prefer the music which breaks physical barrier and enter into the soul and relax or soothe you, then this album is definitely a 'No Go'.I heard it only once and was full of headache within 5 minutes of listening to it.So again Beware Don't go for it."
2,great idea-poor design,This clipper is not designed for seniors with thicker toenails. It doesn't open wide enough to accomodate a thicker toenail.I sent it to my brother in Florida and he called to let me know he couldn't use it. It was very disappointing because he isn't well enough to deal with returning the item.
3,Easy Grip Pro toe nail clipper,"A well made product, but frustrating to use as the plastic guards over the cutters obscure the position of the nail you are cutting. I know the guards are to protect your toe from getting accidentally cut, but when you can't see what you are cutting the advantage is lost. Seem to be good quality."
1,Poor/No QC?,"The DENCO clipper I received had misaligned blades - visually hard to see but resulting in partly cut / partly torn nails. I asked for a replacement - the company was slow to respond, but then sent another clipper. Out of the box it was also misaligned, worse than the first clipper. Again a request for remedy was slowly responded to (both times it appeared my request was ignored until I repeated the request after 2-3 weeks). The third clipper was also misaligned, out of the box. I finally gave up and asked for a refund - that was 2 months ago, and still no response from GroomMate.This is highly unfortunate - I need a clipper like this due to an injury that makes using normal all-metal clippers very difficult. But the deficiencies appear to be more than just bad luck - three misaligned clippers, and three times very sluggish customer service response."
5,What a surprise!!!,"At first, I thought the period of Pickled Dog Caper would not hold my interest, how wrong! The story stays with me like a mind tic!It's a great read and an experience!!"
3,"A Good Biography, But Nothing New","Those interested in reading about former Green Bay Packers' quarterback Bart Starr for the first time will find this to be an interesting biography. However, if you have read previous books on the Packers such as Jerry Kramer's ""Instant Replay"" and David Maraniss's definitive biography on Vince Lombardi entitled ""When Pride Still Mattered"", you will not find anything new here. Author David Claerbaut relies heavily on Maraniss's book on Lombardi in addition to having a similar title ""When Leadership Mattered."" Claerbaut does delve into Starr's nine years as the coach of the Packers in addition to Starr's son, Brett, who suffered from drug addiction. As far as Starr's years as a player for the Packers is concerned what this book has to offer can be found in several other books on the team. However, if you have not read a previous book on Bart Starr or the Packers of the 1960's then you will enjoy this book."
4,BART STARR GETS 4 STARS,THIS IS A NICE BOOK ABOUT FORMER PACKER QUARTER BACK BART STARR. THE AUTHOR DOES A NICE JOB GIVING US A LOOK AT THE PERSON AND PLAYER. HE ALSO TELLS OF THE SEASONS THAT STARR COACHED THE PACKERS WHICH I KNOW VERY LITTLE OF. I ALSO ENJOYED THE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF EACH SEASON AND ALL THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES. THE NEGATIVE I HAVE IS THAT IT SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON VINCE LOMBARDI. IT ALMOST COULD HAVE BEEN 2 BIOGRAPHIES IN ONE WITH ALL THE PAGES DEDICATED TO LOMBARDI. BUT ALL IN ALL IN ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL FOOTBALL FANS.
5,Great little made for TV thriller starring Tom Selleck and Mimi Rogers!!!,"This is a great little made for TV thriller starring Tom Selleck(Magnum P.I.)and Mimi Rogers(Austin Powers)!!! A modern day film noir thriller!!! Even though this is a made for TV movie,it has solid production values!!! A great little gem from beginning to end!!! Recommended for fans of thriilers and Tom Selleck!!! Five stars!!! A+"
5,A Selleck Fan,"I've read most all of Robert Parker's books, including Jesse Stone. This series of stories are adapted very nicely to film, given the time constraints. Yeah, the story-line is tailored to less than two hours and, yeah, that requires they edit out a little but, overall, the movies are all well done.And theres Tom Selleck. I can't think of a better fit for Jesse Stone. He captures the tired, nearly alcoholic police chief beautifully. Even just walking he seems as though there's just too much weight on his shoulders.Even though I gave five stars I must admit I get annoyed at times with Parker. Jesse could as easily be Spenser (or Spenser Jesse.) A sentence with more than three words would be nice once in a while. But that's me."
5,An Excellent Accident,"I accidentally found this movie while searching for another. I am a Tom Selleck fan from Magnum PI reruns and his work on Friends. I figured, given the level of junk that passes for entertainment these days, I could risk a Tom Selleck movie. Man am I happy I did. I now own all 3 of the Jesse Stone movies and am ordering the 4th today. I do not want to ramble or rant, this is an excellent movie series."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!,"This DVD finalized my Jesse Stone collection. It's THEE best DVD movie collection that I have. I want get all of Tom Selleck's films. If you have a list of his movies I could use one. Also want Bluebloods, 2nd season that was just released. Thanks"
5,Great Series,"If you haven't already started the Jesse Stone series and like Tom Selleck don't pass these by. I love them. They are a nice change from the Hollywood movie of today with all the fancy digital, but little substance."
3,"Stone Cold by Tom Selleck, Mimi Rogers, Jane Adams (II), Reg Rogers",I had seen this before. It wasn't as good the second time around. I do whoever like Tom Selleck. The second time around seemed to move slow.
3,Not nearly as good as the prequel.,For one thing it cost twice as much as the other Jesse Stone movies on Amazon Prime. It took on more of the air of a skin flick. Sort of like some of the series that have to rely in sex to survive. It sort of soured me from looking at the rest of the Jesse Stone movies.
5,Stone Cold,My husband and I really like Tom Selleck' movies. He does not do junk movies. He is especially great in Westerns!
3,Something Done Well,"John Updike famously said, ""Ted Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill."" That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. One of my favorite aspects of ""Stone Cold"" is the Columbo-like cat and mouse between the serial killers and Jesse. Early on, we know who the killers are, but it is fascinating to see this small-town cop (""I mostly give out parking tickets."") match wits with the killers, who smugly revel in their intellectual background. Satisfying storytelling."
4,Movie,"What can I say, Tom Selleck does it again as Jesse the recovering alcoholic detective.Selleck gives a very believable performance, and shows rather excellent detective skills in solving this mystery. The series of Jesse Stone are good watching, with interesting plots and some emotional side issues.The Jesse Stone Film Collection (Stone Cold / Death in Paradise / Night Passage)Jesse Stone: Thin Ice"
4,Stone Cold,Tom Selleck is an all around actor who really makes this movie. Good entertainment. A real thriller.
4,A first with Jesse Stone,"I usually like Tom Selleck but I had put off purchasing any of the Jesse Stone films until recently. I bought Stone Cold as an experiment and was very pleased. I like the character of Jesse Stone as a man with some issues to deal with but still a man with interest in and compassion for his fellow townspeople. Tom Selleck portrays this man on the edge of burn-out very believably. I like this first sampling enough to purchase the three other Jesse Stone offerings and to pre-order the one yet to be released.Jesse has moved from Los Angeles to a small East Coast town, looking for some peace. However, it turns out, even small towns have murders. Not only are all the characters, as well as Jesse Stone, portrayed well, but the plot is intriguing and keeps your attention right up to the climax of the mystery."
5,Jesse Stone: Stone Cold,"I have found that the Jesse Stone Series are very entertaining, especially the interpretation and performance by Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone,were superb and believable. Owning all the previous DVD's I hope that there are some more forthcoming."
3,Gift,"I needed this for a gift for a friend that has the collection, but for some reason never got the first one. They absolute love Tom Selleck and the Jesse Stone series."
5,Jessie Stone : Stone Cold,"selleck is great; would prefer a PG version. Stories are original and interesting.Seven more words: well scripted, witty, and different"
4,Counselor Approval,"This book was an immense source of help and information to thestudents at the high school I work at, as well as to their parents.It goes along way to de-mystifying this process. I found information here that I have not seen in any of the other numerous resources for financial aid. I would particularly suggest it to parents."
4,Easy install,"UPS dropped this cover of at my house at 6:05 in the evening. I decided that I wanted it on that night, as I had a dry truck bed, and the weather could change quickly. I grabbed my tool-kit (including my box knife to open the box) and told my wife I'd come down to put he kids to bed by 7:00. I figured about an hour should get it done (regardless of what others said). Well, I never touched the toolbox (including the box knife) and was showing off the cover to my wife by 6:20. Easy install, if fit my '05 dakota well, and it looks great. Also, it drives quiet!!!Product looks sturdy, and the only reason I didn't rate it a five was that I havn't seen if it keeps out water yet. If it keeps everything dry (and the snow off my truck bed) I'll try to remember to come by and change my rating."
4,Whose House? Derrick's House!,"Acclaimed DJ Derrick Carter has released a fine mix CD which features his love for soulful house. Derrick's beats are hyper and energetic, and the groove never relents from the first track. While some DJs inject techno and European influences into their mixing, Carter's a soul man all the way, featuring some pretty decent vocals, and even a spoken sample from ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,"" which opens the disc. The mixing is well done, as the tracks blend nicely together, and there are no awkward transitions. It's clear that Carter is a seasoned veteran in the game of house, and it's right ""about now"" that you should go and get this CD."
2,Hodgman Waders,Waders ordered and received were size XXL. These would fit a 6ft 2inch plus person who is very thin with max 40 inch chest and size 13 shoe. Maybe this is made to an XLT size but no good for a regular XXL person.Quality looks ok but be very wary when selecing your size.
4,A Thrill - Ride all its own.,Great video! The coasters are presented great! The only complaint is the usual one. The Great Bear and Medusa on-ride view. Other than that the best coaster video yet!
1,Blasting Techno Music Ruined It,"I wanted to sit back, and feel as if I were on these great rides. Instead, they made the ridiculous decision to add loud music to the rides. There are two main senses involved (besides the body feel - which of course they can't supply) . . . sight and sound. You want to hear the wheels whirring, the air rushing by, the screams and the silence at the top of the first hill. Instead, you hear track after track of thighmaster Infomercial music. That destroyed the experience. Take out the music, and this would have ""rocked"" !!"
4,Great Sample of the Best Rides Around,This video is one of the best videos I have ever seen involving roller coasters. The selection is truly remarkable and the best rides (and the most) are showcased. Only drawback: Medusa's footage being sped up
4,A very good roller coaster video,"A great video about roller coasters,but they mest up The Great Bear and Medusa.I wish the said more about Six Flags America though,but I would heighly recomend this video for any roller coaster fan"
3,whats up with this?,"i have on MAJOR complaint about this viedo why the heck did they do that to ""Great Bear""? I think it was a very stupid thing for goldhil to have done!"
5,Thrills,"This Video features Ridlers Revenge, Apollos Charriot, Raging Bull, Jokers Jinx, Hulk, Dueling Dragons Medusa ( and More! ) in this hoour and a half video. Wow, this is NOT a three d video! THIS ALSO includes virtual WHOLE rides of stealth, millenium force, kraken, Goliath, and the new coaster in 2001 at SFGam--River Best---the launched 120 m/p/h. superman, but 500 feet, made by bolliger and mabilaard"
2,"Inspiring, but little information.","This was an OK read. It was inspiring but for the amount of content, they had way too many pictures as filler. I felt perhaps this would have been better as a magazine article."
3,review,"Interesting read. Not a typical showcase of a glut of spectacular design, but creatively inspiring. Clever lads!"
5,Delightful,"An odd assortment of singers you never thought of putting together, come together to produce a truly delightful Christmas concert. The visuals are beautiful to look at as well."
1,Needed more Charlotte,"Disappointed to have only three songs with Miss Church. ""Oh, Holy Night"" is the highlight of the album. Charlotte Church and Placido Domingo's high caliber voices duet very well. Tony Bennett's ""talk - sing"" style announces his aged voice. He should have been left off the album all together."
3,a voice teacher and early music fan,"ONE AT A TIME IF YOU PLEASE!!!!This disc includes four of the best voices of our day, BUT they simply do not belong together in one program!!!!Somehow hearing 'O Holy Night' by two classical sounding singers following 'The Christmas Song' sung by a jazz-pop singer doesn't 'light my fire'. Now if you offered me a complete album of anyone of these singers, I probably would take it and enjoy it. Obviously, this is a money-making venture of the extreme sort; after all(say the great commercial powers) if you don't like Tony Bennett, then you have Placido Domingo etc. etc. etc. As I recall the same type disc was recorded 2 years ago (1998) with four diverse singers, Domingo again included.Oh well, the individual contributions are, for the most part enjoyable, but you will notice I did say: for the most part."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Yes, it was a huge disappointment. Vanessa Williams could not sing. Tony Bennett tried to drag out his ego by create his own version of bad music. The only three highlights were Charlotte Church, Placido Domingo,and the children chorus of Vienna. I could not understand why Vanessa Williams was a part of this? She was not a singer at all. Did they bring her in for her look? And Tony Bennett? It appeared like he just showed up at the concert without any rehearsal and made up his own tune. And why Charlotte Church was only a small part of this? Certainly she was bigger than Vanessa Williams and a rising star of the European stage, and she had only a minor role?"
1,I don't get him...,"I just dont understand the hype about this guy. His voice is barely mediocre, and, to me, his songs are annoying and repetative. And don't have much of a point. Obviously, other people disagree, but this is just my (never to be humble) opnion."
1,Not Much to Talk About,"It is hard to review something you paid for yet never received. I am sure the book will be very useful if I ever receive it. I oredered it on May 9th and today is June 25th. Thank educational_book_brokers for being so prompt in sending me the book I wanted, ordered, paid for, and never received. Also thank you not responding to the two previous e-mails. Yes sir, I now have a great testimony about buying books on the web."
3,Design is too bulky for camera.,Good quality but design is too bulky for camera. Matches S400 series better. Makes SD series look too big.
4,Nice Camera Case,"Fits my SD450 perfectly, but a little bulky to put in your pocket. On the pricey side if you are paying full price for it, but then again, it's Coach, so you pay for the ""C"" on the bottom..."
3,"Canon Coach Case for Digital Elph Cameras--OK, but small","While the case fits my Canon perfectly, what is one to do with extra cards and rechargable batteries? These aren't big, but there is absolutely no space aboard this camera case to stow such necesseties. It's a handsome case, but plan on needing another bag. It would be nice if it had the option of a strap, too. Once you have the camera out, you need to find a place to sit the case. With a strap, you could just leave it slung across your body. (It does have a loop on the back with which to thread it onto a belt, but this seems more ""guy"" than ""gal"" friendly. R. Roman, Somerset, CA"
1,Awful,"Camera barely fit, no padding. I think I would damage the camera more trying to get it in and out of the case than I would if I simply didn't use the case at all. I got it for free with the camera so I can't complain about the price, but I can't believe anyone would spend money on the camera and then keep it in this case."
4,Solid Case that holds an extra battery,"I just got the Coach case for my Canon SD 500. I ordered both the standard Canon case and this one. The PSC 50 is a bit slimmer and the leather is softer, but I like the Coach case better. It has a small compartment, just big enough to fit an extra battery, which is important to me. In addition, it looks more elegant and stylish, and the price is reasonable. I'll keep both, since the PSC 50 was only 9 bucks, but I'll definitely use the Coach case."
2,Canon coach case S410,"Although the package is good and the shipping is fast, the case may be a little tight for the camera. The leather is too hard if it is leather."
1,Less than $10 and I still returned it...lousy case.,"I purchased this case on the Coach/Canon deal...what a mistake. The leather is stiff and the fit is very box-like (it defeats the purpose of having a small camera). I thought the embossed, pebble-grain leather looked terrible (the Coach logo looks bad too). The leather inside was smooth, but overall the case did not seem soft enough for a camera. I ended up returning this lousy case (even though it only cost me $10) and picked up the standard Canon leather case for the PowerShot S410 - it is excellent!"
2,disappointed,"strangly, the design of this case it really lacking. when you close the case, there is a hole at the top that allows the camera's strap to come through - this hole is out of alignment, and bends the strap in such a way, that when you carry the camera by the strap, it forces the case open - due to it's weak magnetic snap.lame-o"
4,Unicorn Book of 1952,"Family found this book for me as I was attending this year my 60 year HS reunion(1952.)Found mention of my classmate and friend's father, Max Conrad under People and am sending her a copy also. Book in good condition. Thanks."
3,Where is the product and care information?,"We recieved our Kelty Eclipse 20 Degree Long Sleeping Bag in a timely manner and for a good price, however, no information was sent regarding the bag materials or how to care for the bag. To me this is a grave error."
2,Decent table. Poor description!,"Just got the table and it feels a bit off. The frame isn't quite squared, the clips aren't large enough to clip the plexiglass to the table and the paper is a single piece just barely large enough to cover the table. But the table will do the job, the welds feel strong and the table is quite stable.In the technical details it lists ""2x light stands, 2x white umbrellas, 2x light holder and 2x 5000k day light balanced fluorescent bulbs"". THESE ITEMS WERE NOT INCLUDED. Now, in all fairness in the hand written product description it does state ""SHOOTING TABLE ONLY. ACTION FIGURE NOT INCLUDED."". This makes me think its kind of a joke like 'oh by the way you don't get the toy with the package.' It would have been clearer to simply state 'Shooting table only"". But if this is how it comes the technical details really need to be updated."
4,pretty good phone,I love my phone and think its great it has good features and get the job done it is one of i belive 2 phones that has a flash light and just to clear the air it isnt fuzzy sounding naturally it depends on ur company and how much service u have
1,very bad,"Don't touch it, otherwise I am sure you will regret as I did. I really admire those Kyocera people who can make something so bad."
2,HAND ME A RED PEN PLEASE!!!,The story was ok but the errors were scary... I felt like I had been grading a 5th graders paper. After a while I became distracted with the number of errors rather than the story line. ...
5,get your own,"Finally a woman who is willing to go get her own. Many book have black women sitting at home waiting for their drug dealing boyfriend to get out of prison, and take care of them. The title character goes out, and gets her own."
5,An Escape to the Other Side,"This was a great read. Quick and full of action. I appreciated the glance of the other side. It was interesting to see the choices that many people will make in the pursuit of power, money, and material things. This was a good first attempt for Shannon Holmes. However, there were a few typos in the book, but not enough to distract this reader. Good Job! I can't wait for the next one."
3,it was good but not all that,this book was good. it wasnt all that i have read better. netta and her crew deserved wat they got when they tried to play the game and the game ended up playin them and at the end netta had to pay the ultimate price! almost her life. i didnt like the ending one bit . it defiantely could of been much better but overall good job !
5,A MUST BUY,"This is an excellent book!!! It is good from the first page through the last. It will have you dying for a sequel. I'll say this, if you love the Coldest Winter Ever and B-More Careful as I did, you will love this book. I read one bad review criticizing the comparison and I strongly disagree. This book is for those who have lived in similar conditions like those described in Coldest Winter and B-More. If are not familiar with such conditions, a true appreciation for this novel can be lost. Nettie, main character, is a strong black women. Although she doesn't represent what is traditionally considered strong qualities, she is strong none the less. I really cannot stress how much I loved this book. I hope we continue to see such true-life like entertaining fiction in the future."
5,B-More Careful: A Novel,"This book will get five stars from me. I live in the Washington, D.C./Balitmore Area so everything felt like home to me. The mentality, the clothing, the locations.....everything. I am not really into reading books, but when a girlfriend referred this book, I decided to read it. And let me tell you, from the beginning to the end I was stuck. Found my self reading it in bed at night. So if you enjoy REALNESS within a book, this book is for you. I will admit there were errors in the writing of the book but that made it even better...to show the rawness at stake. I am going to promote this book!"
2,it was ok byt i have read way better!,"O.k now this book was ok but, i have read better. i did not like the way the story really ended. i really did not care for the charters. i am from b-more myself so i can relate to the places where they were and i understood that. if you want to read the best book in the world read true to the game !!!"
4,Interesting,The only kind of books I honestly enjoy is stories about the game and the streets so this book definately caught my eye. I enjoyed every minute of it and the ending was shocking. Overall it was a good book. I'd recommend it to anybody.
3,"GOOD READ, BUT NEEDS EDITORIAL ASSISTANCE","GREAT READ. THE BOOK IS REAL, GRITTY & RAW. A DEFINITE PAGE TURNER. ON A NEGATIVE NOTE HOWEVER, THE EDITING WAS HORRIBLE!! I HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK WITH SUCH BAD SPELLING, TYPOS, ETC. IF YOU CAN OVERLOOK THIS, YOU WILL DEFINITELY ENJOY THE NOVEL."
5,Captivating and Truthful,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was a page turner that kept me begging for more. The writer really brought the characters to life in this book, because I found myself talking to the book asking why they did one thing or the other. I give it a high score and refer anyone looking for a good book to read this!"
5,great book...poor edtiing,This was an excellent book. I just hate reading books with such poor editing.
1,B-more careful how you spend your money,"This must be one of the worse books that I've ever read, it truly was a waste of time. I read one review that compared it the ""The Coldest Winter Ever""--well, know that B-more Careful is by no stretch of the imagination a formidable opponent for Sister Souljah's talent.My middle school students can turn out better fiction than this.For those of you that thought this was an excellent piece of literature it is obvious that you have not read much. You should start with a little Zora Neal Hurston (Their Eyes were watching God), followed by some Langston Hughes, and don't forget California Cooper.Holla"
1,WHAT??? THIS WAS GARBAGE!!,"OKAY FOR ONE THIS BOOK ""i thought"" WOULD BE GOOD. WELL I THOUGHT WRONG.. I THINK THE STORY LINE WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT THE AUTHOR DIDNT KNOW HOW TO USE IT. THE BOOK WAS TALKING ABOUT TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT DIDNT HAVE NUTHING TO DO WITH NUTHING. THERE WAS WAY TOO MANY CHARACTERS AND SHE REALLY NEED SOME EDITING!! SHE KEPT REPEATING HERSELF OVER AND OVER .... MAN AND I ONLY GAVE IT ""ONE STAR"" BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT. MAN I THINK THIS WAS A WANNA BE ""COLDEST WINTER EVER"" BY SISTA SOULJAH... IT JUST PISSED ME OFF THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME. PEOPLE KEPT TELLIN ME IT WAS GOOD BUT THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY..."
1,B-More Careful When Wasting Your Money!,"Okay I know what you all are saying. The reviews at they top say this is a great book. Well, the reviewers at the top have a great ability to ignore constant grammar errors and a story line that doesn't seem to follow in any direction most readers would call ""interesting"". I was excited when I ordered this book. I heard great things about this book. Once I started I just couldn't finish. I had to tell myself to read it like it was a project or a assignment. It just doesn't follow through. It goes this way and that. I am telling you as a very concerned 16 year old high school student. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. And Teri Woods got her name all over the book like she is Ralph Ellison or Toni Morrison. She has a very long way to go! Trust me."
2,"Please, not another ""tale from the 'hood...""","I read Holmes' book and found it very hard to follow. With a BA in English, I have had to read many a novel. While I applaud Holmes' subject matter, he needs to develop his skill as a novelist. Many African-Americans (I am one) seem willing to accept low-grade artistic work just because we are the featured characters. This must stop. Unless Holmes is willing to work at it, he will never be another Ellison, Hughes, or Morrison. Yes, there is enough space for every type of author, but, help me out folks...there has to be more going on in a cautionary tale than a lot of gratuitous violence. We all deserve better."
5,B-More!!!,"Great Book, and true to the Game. I liked the way the relationship between Mimi and Netta transform, showing the true hater-ism that exist amongst friends. And people keeping it real in general."
4,this is a o.k. book,this book was ok but i liked the coldest winter ever was better because first i did not like how the sorry ended. i also do not like how the characters were. but i would recommended this book if you really liked the coldest winter ever.................booker t. washington middle school r.e.p in what you got a problem in baltimore maryland in what
5,Just As Good As The Coldest Winter Ever,"I had previously reviewed this book and when I looked under my reviews I didn't see it. B-More Careful is to good of a book not to recommend it. It is very gritty and grimmy. To many authors try to write ghetto fiction and it comes off like most of the other books, seeming repetitive and unbelievable. B-More Careful has so many twists and turns. These girls were really ""getting how they live"". Please read it. I am going to read it for a second time."
2,Room for improvement,"Poor editing aside, Shannon Holmes possibly could have a career as an author. B'more Careful presents a different world to the naive while glorifying it for those who live in this world or want to become a part of the drama that dealing drugs can lead to. A good writer researches the topic even if they feel they have lived through it. Not knowing how long it took Mr. Holmes to write his ""novel,"" a little more time, with a little more rewriting would have resulted in a better product. Don't insult the reader's intelligence by thinking you have to spell everything out."
4,On second thougt,"When I first read B-More I didn't care for it. After reading it again I've changed my mind. It's a good story and just when you think that the author is glorifying the street life Shannon Holmes turns around and shows the reader that Thugs pay a price for their lifestyles. Without preaching the author quietly offers a lesson about actions having consequences. It is an exciting tale and if you loved Coldest Winter or True to the Game this book will thrill you too. Hopefully the author will get a better editor and proofreader for the next edition of the book because it screams, cries, and begs for grammatical help in several places."
5,Loved this book,this was the first book by Teri Woods I read. My nefew loaned it to me and I could not put it down. I read it all the way from Detroit to Chicago. I really loved this book. It opened my eyes to a lot of street life STUFF!@!
4,"Great book, poor editing","Great book! B-more careful is the story of four teenage girls in Baltimore. Shannon Holmes writes this book using very descriptive and colorful writing. Having gone to school in Baltimore, I felt like getting on the next flight out!This book has been compared to The Coldest Winter Ever, but I think it's better. Netta and her crew leave you anxious to see how each story will unfold. This book tells the truth about and explains the motives of the inner city and the young men and women growing up in it.The only downfall to this book is the editing. It can be quite frustrating and distracting. After reading, I even wanted to volunteer my editing expertise to Ms. Holmes."
4,A wild Ride,"The book was an okay read. There were just too many twists and turns in the end, that ought to be illegal!!! Overall the book took too many directions."
3,"Great Drama, Poor Editing !","This book immediately draws you in.It covers drugs,sex,love, money,jealousy,loyalty,killings etc. All of the makings of a great book.However,the author, Shannon Holmes skipped over a lot of details in the book. Not enough follow through w/the characters in the story.In addition, the book is poorly edited.It appears that Ms. Holmes was in a rush to get the book published.If Ms. Holmes continues to write more books,she needs to use another publishing company;one with excellent proof readers and editors on staff."
3,I'm in need of an editor!,"B-more Careful by Shannon Holmes is a definite page turner, however the book is in dire need of a more experienced editor. It seems as if Mr. Holmes was in a rush to get this story published."
3,GHETTO-FABULOUS,"If you are a fan of ""True to the Game"", then here is another story for you. ""B-more Careful"" was fun, and at times suspenseful to read. It's attraction - real life. These are stories that you see everyday - particularly here in Baltimore. Netta and her gang wanted a better life. And they used the only thing they had to get it - their bodies. Black's was consumed by greed and his love for his father drove him to insanity. MiMi was driven by jealous. But was it really worth it all.It is always fun to read stories such as these but my only concern is when will somebody come up with a solution. All of the controvery over whether it is true or fictional and the alleged law suits that are being filed should give you some sort of hint.Peace and Blessings!!"
5,B-MORE CAREFUL,"I liked B-More Careful, I feel it was a learning experience for those that are in the life and trying to get in the life. It's letting you know the game is not all fun and glamour. There are a lot of down falls. I think if your not into the life and trying to get there read B-More Careful and see what you are getting yourself into, because this book basically tells the game. For those that are in life need to read and see what their life is headed for. There are real people out there like Black, Mimi and other characters in the book. I give Shannon Holmes 5 stars on this one. This book hits home to most urban lives."
1,This book sucks!,What is going on? Really? The plot changed like every 3 pages. It took me a month to read this book. The writing style was terrible and they need to get a new editor cause there were alot of mispelled words. It was so predictable it was like watching Friday the 13th.
2,OMG!!!,"oh my goodness this book was ok at the biginning but, too much of the same old stuff, too much about sucking stuff and shooting up over and over again, if you like this type of stuff then buy it no type of romance love or anything. I was so happy when I got done relieved relaxed. DONT GET."
4,A must Read,"I was on the transit in Washington, DC a few years ago when I noticed another female passenger reading this book. She was so engrossed in the book I had to ask her about. Her reviews made me pick up my own copy shortly thereafter. I have to tell you, I couldn't put the book down. The characters were commonly real to me. I finished the book in 24 hrs. Great Book!!!"
3,It was a good book,"I enjoyed this book although I have pretty high standards after reading ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" so I wasn't thrilled to pieces. The story line kind of confused me at first then i caught wind of the style. I enjoyed the raw depiction of the characters lives. I would recommend this book to those who liked ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" by Sistah Souljah."
4,B-More Careful,"B-More Careful was a really good book, but I still think that True To The Game was better. I really enjoyed both of them."
2,In need of professional editing!,"I couldn't wait to read B-more Careful after being told by a friend this book was better than The Coldest Winter Ever, by Sister Souljah. Well... was I ever shocked!Actually, I did enjoy this story written by Shannon Holmes and I do believe this author has great skills as a story teller. However, the sad part about this novel is the poor and inadequate editing displayed throughout its pages.Had this book been professionally edited, I'd gladly given it 5 stars."
3,DRAMA,"This book is all about the streets!!!!! Drama, drama, drama!!! I suggest picking up this book for those pre-teens, teens, and young adults out there who are trying to live that fast life. Maybe after reading, ""B-MORE CAREFUL"" they'll appreciate their lives more and make better decisions for themselves."
4,Good Book,A good book about the street life in the eyes of both man and girl. Only problem was to many names appear in relation to the main character. I had to keep going back to see how the people linked to the story.
2,LOVE THE TITLE.....,"As far as the book goes I didn't think it was good. There were just way too many characters, a lot of things going on . Don't waste your money like I did, just get it from a friend if you really want to read it."
5,Off The Chain!!,B-More Careful was off the chain. I enjoy this book very much. Black was real grimey. That wasn't right what he did to Netta. But it was a great book. Can't wait for B-More Careful part 2.
5,OFF DA DAMN HEEZZZYYYYYYY,OH MY GOODNESS! WHERE SHOULD I START. THIS BOOK TOOK ME 3 HOURS TO READ. I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. THE GIRLS IN THIS BOOK WAS WILDIN. GOOD READ. I RECOMMEND BAD GIRLZ ALSO.
4,off the chain...not because I'm from b-more,"I loved this book because it came accross very realistically. I've never lived the lifestyle of the gold digging females portrayed, but it gave a clear picture of what some females will do for money, as well as the consequences."
5,A GOOOOOD BOOK!,"I don't usually read stories about ""the life"", but this one I am glad that I read it. This book had me on the edge of my seat until I figured that I had to finish the rest of it the day after I bought it. It is packed with action, drugs, and murder. Despite the many grammar mistakes the book contained, I really enjoyed reading it."
1,Pure T. Comedy,"Mr. Holmes you string together a jam-packed story. But please use some of your royalty earnings to buy a spellcheck program for your computer. Ebonics is one thing. Piss poor grammar is another. For example, Tina doesn't take ""Zoloft"" to cope with her son's funeral. She takes ""Zorloff."" Wassat?!? Hatreds aren't ""deep seated"". They're ""deep seeded."" People are ""dumb founded"" when they discover sheisty folks have been scheming behind their backs ""all awhile."" One of my favorite sentences: ""That summed up Mimi in a nutshell, past being beautiful."" A nutshell plus one? No such thing. The plot tries to gallop but the junky grammar adds weight, kept pulling me out of the story. If you're someone who actually knows how to read and likes to do so more than once or twice a year, you're going to have a hard time finishing this book. Feeling the plot, hating the vehicle."
4,Good Read!!!,I just finished reading this book a friend of mine gave it to me and I can say that this was a very good book. B-More areful will keep you on the edge of your seat!!!
5,This book was exciting to read,This book was very exciting to read i really enjoyed the way they handle thier business and how they carried themselves like young ladies.I also loved the drama and how they kept you wondering what was going to happen next.I had read this book about 3 years ago it was so interesting to me that i had been trying to find it and add it to my book collection.I couldn't even put it down i had to just keep on reading it to see what the end was going to be.I had to let my family and friends read and they to also enjoyed the book.Shannon Holmes is a wonderful writer i also enjoyed his book Bad Girls For Life.Thank You Ms.Gloria
3,DIDN'T GET EXCITED TILL THE END,"I RECENTLY READ TERRI WOODS ""TRUE TO THE GAME"" WHICH I LOVED. THIS BOOK APPEARED TO HAVE THE SAME FLARE AND ADDICTIVE QUALITIES THAT I ADMIRED ABOUT ""TRUE TO THE GAME"". HOWEVER, I DIDN'T REALLY ENJOY THIS BOOK UNTIL 3/4 OF THE WAY THROUGH. THE STORY LINE JUMPED BACK AND FORTH, PAST TO PRESENT, PERSON TO PERSON. IT WAS WRITTEN WELL ENOUGH TO FOLLOW ALONG BUT IT JUST WASN'T GRABBING ME AND I WAS UNSURE OF WHERE THE PLOT WAS GOING. IN THE BOOKS DEFENSE, THE LAST 1/4 OF THE BOOK HAD ME STUCK IN MY BED READING PAGE AFTER PAGE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK BUT ONLY TO A PATIENT READER WILLING TO HOLD OUT FOR A GREAT ENDING."
3,B-More Thorough,"I enjoyed the book, especially in the beginning. It reminded me of Sista Soulja's book The Coldest Winter..... Although (and maybe it's just me)I did find typos in the book and incomplete thoughts. I expected to learn more about the other members in ""The Pound."" Besides Mimi and Netta, the only thing we learned about the other members was the complexion of their skin, who they were messing with (First Chapter), and the fact that they were down w/the game of gold digging and scheming. We learned more about the extra (if you want to call them that) characters in the book besides the characters who were in ""The Pound."" The part I didn't like is after Black beat Netta, the book seemed to turn into a soap opera. It kind of lost its reality touch. In all a good read. I would like to give it 3.5 stars."
3,Cookie jar,"It was an amazing looking cookie jar I was so excited at how it looked when I first received it but then web I assembled it together I was very very disappointed to see the lid didn't fit ,it refuses to stay on it just pops up so unfortunately it wouldn't be a good idea to keep cookies in it"
1,Yuck!,"I am a fan of klezmer and enjoy it very much, but this cd gave me a headache! It was hyper and not high quality. I don't reccomend it at all. Try Debbie Friedman, an amazing singer with beautiful songs."
3,"Meet Tiger Mann, Baby!","This was Mickey SPillane's short-lived Cold War spy series. These two episodes featured Tiger Mann (his real name), a former World War II OSS operative who now works for a private sector espionage agency dedicated to preserving liberty and the free enterprise system.Tiger is a typical Spillane hero, and the action moves along, but this dates badly -- chunks of dialogue that were once supposedly serious now seem very much in the style of AUSTIN POWERS, Baby!"
3,Good Blood Sugar,It really does make for stable blood sugar and cravings for sugar diminish pretty quickly. It's just a little to restricted for me; I'm not that creative with the meals.
2,Too little,"I recently bought this book and am quite disappointed. If you have never used an art program before, then this book may help. If you have even a little background in PhotoShop, this book will not help in any way. I also never saw how they got the 2160 page count, it can't be more than 100."
4,okay for beginners!,"This book is best for beginners and not-so-advanced users. But for most advanced features, I had to get a more thorough book."
5,Spicy hot,This product arrived really fast. I've been using it for years but they don't sell it where I live.
1,Yuck! Far too salty!,"Same complaint I made elsewhere. This product is so horribly salty I can't taste the seasoning. I won't buy it again. Now, I won't throw it away, though. I'll use it as salt. That's all it is. It's just salt, and when I put on the appropriate amount of salt, I won't expect to taste any seasoning (despite the claim on the package that when it's salty enough, it's seasoned to perfection). My partner says he used to use Tony's many years ago, and that something has changed. Says it wasn't so dreadfully salty back then."
4,Beating a path,"I bought a refurbished Weed Eater. After a minor problem with the pull start Ive been able to beat a path anywhere on my place. This product is highly recommended for persons with back problems, since you can roll the device to the work and so is no strain on the back or sholder areas.Persons with heart problems can get back out in the yard and easily handle the weeds"
3,Great product--No support,"I ordered my second one of these great machines after wearing the first totally out. It is wonderful if you have upper body problems or diminished arm strength. It is also easy to use for close work.However, this time I had to have it shipped in because no one locally carried it. Amazon was great--I had it in less than the estimated time.Now the rub--it arrived with a motor that runs on the first crank but does not turn the cutting head. I can't ship it back, according to some nitwit girl I finally got after a prolonged wait to the ""helpline"" and will have to take it to an authorized dealer (some customer support!). After another prolonged time calling the dealers the n-w girly had (who were no longer in business), I found one about thirty miles from where I live. They can take it but after a three week waiting list!!!!! Luckily we are in a drought and the weeds aren't growing that much.I don't know whether to be angry with Weedeater or the whole wallyworld."
2,Brand new and won't work,"Received the unit and prepared to work...the unit would crank to but the cutting head would not turn. Had to find a repair shop that did warranty work (25 miles away) before the first use. Diagnosis -- drive tube had not been inserted all the way so the unit had to be disassembled for repair and reassembled. Two more weeks of not being able to do trim work. Hopefully, it will now work as I had hoped.The appeal of the unit was it's lighter weight and smaller size. Would I buy it again, probably.. but preferably through a local dealer. I will add that this is the first and ONLY time I have ever been disappointed with a purchase through Amazon"
1,Defective,My Weedeater was defective. The Trimmer head cable was not connected and the engine was not installed correctly. I had to take it to a repair station before I could use it.
1,"REFURBISHED, YOU MEAN BROKEN AND STILL BROKEN!","I thought this was such a great deal. I have never had any trouble with any refurbished product before now. The motor comes on great, starts up with not problem. The thing that turns the string to actually cut the weeds and grass doesn't turn. I took it apart, as I am usually handy and found the problem. Unfortunately, the problem is recurring. We have had it for a month now and have yet to weedeat one blade of grass. Don't even try to get a hold of the manufacturer! They won't do anything, thats if you can even get a hold of someone. BIG WASTE OF MONEY AND MY TIME!!! Do not buy from this company. All they had to do was turn it on to see it did not work, but they sold it to me anyway. I suggest that Amazon drops this company from their stable, they don't live up to Amazons standards!!!!! I might as well have throw away the $88.00."
3,1st one broken when rec'd,"Haven't used much. 1st one was broken when rec'd, but Amazon sent a new one right away much to my satisfaction. Doesn't cut as cleanly due to ""fat"" (special-only thru weedeater) line."
1,product shipping,"When the product was received the box was ok , but the weed eater was not put together correctely, and the spark plug was broken, which cost me $4.oo to replace , then put the whole unit together again. As for what the product was made for , it does a great job. Not pleased at all with the shipping and the condition the weed eater was in. Thanks Bill"
1,I used it - I can't stand it,"I bought this unit recently - thinking that this wheeled trimmer would be easier on my back. Was I ever wrong.First, the engine is very hard to start - plus the pull cord is strung through an eye-bolt that turns if you pull at an angle which will jam the cord.Second, I am 6'4"" and this unit's handles are obviously too short for me. I wouldn't recommend using this trimmer unless you are less than 6 foot tall.Third, the wheels can't handle any uneven terrain - things like going over roots next to a tree require much additional force. Plus if you hit uneven terrain the front of the unit, which has no wheels, has a tendency to tip forward - giving areas you didn't want to wack a too-close trim.Fourth - Since the head is fixed you can't easily position this unit in hard to reach areas.Fifth - I went through two lines just doing 1/4 acre - the lines are expensive to buy.Skip this unit - for the money you can get a very good string trimmer that uses standard line."
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE--HAH!!!!!!,"Just received wt3100 about 2 hours ago....Mesh housing motor cover about 1 1/2"" too short. Have spent the last 2 hours trying to find out how to rectify the problem. One ""authorized dealer"" inferred we got it off the back of a truck. Poulon/Weedeater pretty much blew us off and of course it's not returnable to Amazon. BUYER BEWARE"
2,Reassembly,The Wheeled Trimmer was not assembled correctly and I had to take the wheels off and reassemble the trimmer. It took about two hours. Luckily I noticed the misassembly before I started the trimmer. It works fine now.
1,The King of Weedeaters review,I bought a reconditioned one as the price was good and found it to be as nice as new. I have used it several times in the culvert to knock down the weeds which sit in a wet environment their. With the air intake ducted into the top of the handle it is the perfect tool for some serious weed slashing. Weedeater does a good job on their reconditioned units and even put a bottle of synthetic oil in to boot!
3,It's worth the money,"I was not impressed with the QA of the Weed Eater Company. It arrived in it's original box but had been opened at some point in time but all parts were there. It required quite a bit of rework to get it assembled as it was supposed to be right out of the box. Made me wonder if it had been a return. However once I got it right, it started immediately and does do what it says. The motor is a bit wimpy and not meant for heavy jobs. Takes time to get it aligned to cut in difficult places. Overall it's worth the shortcomings since you don't have to lug it around."
2,construction,"Weed Eater WT3100 16-Inch 31cc 2-Cycle Gas Powered Dual-Cut Wheeled String TrimmerThe spark plug wire was not connected. The wire that turns the trimmer head was not connected and was very difficult to attach. My son-in-law worked for over two hours to get the trimmer in working order. Had he not been here to do this work, I would have had to return the trimmer."
3,Good unit after you rebuild it.,"Could not possibly work as received. Had to dissasemble, reposition, and then reassemble unit. This is a replacement for a 6 year old one that I had and now works very well. I love the unit, but the design must be hell to manufacture due to the difficult assembly sequence required. Some reengineering and this would be a GREAT product. Sure beats hefting a heavy string trimmer around."
1,piece of junk,"My sister had bought one and swore by it the first time she used it. So I bought one a week later. I should of waited for her to use it a month and I could of saved $150.00.It is hard to start,the bump trimmer had to be replaced First year. By the Second season I had hers for parts. And by the end of that season I now am the proud owner of two yard ornaments .Cause thats all theyre good for. So save your money and buy a bird bath or something useful but not this weed eater wt3100."
5,This is my second of this kind,"My first weed eater (on wheels) just died tonight. I bought it 3.5 years ago and have used it in many places, including places it just should never have been used (hard rocky terrain, at chainlink fences, the creek, marshy type areas, etc). I have 2 broken vertebrae and cannot operate a regular weed eater. Even though I have to be careful with this model, I can still get out there and do the jobs that I don't feel comfortable with neighbors doing (esp. in my flower garden!) for me. I buy 2 containers of string everytime I see it on the shelf, just to be sure the store doesn't sell out before I need more. Expensive - NOT! I bought the first one for $150.00, so $50/year of hard labor was nothing to complain about in the end. For those who are getting 'bad' units, I would highly suggest exchanging them. I can't say enough good things about this model... :)"
2,Weed Eater Wheeled Trimmer,"What can I say, the thing works just like Poulan said it would.It's very easy to start, and does a good job trimming in tight spots.Before I purchased this item I'd read a couple of reviews stating that it seemed to use-up a lot of trim-string and that the string was expensive. I didn't find that to be case at all. The trimmer didn't seem to use any more string than most any of the other Trimmer's that I've owned in the past. And...if one buys the string in bulk (3# rolls) it isn't all that expensive.I have no problem recommending this product to anyone."
2,continued disappointments,For a machine that I waa so delighted with and has such great possibilities this is a dud. I was given one for my birthday and within two months I had it in the shop. I finally bought another one because I thought it just had to be that one machine. It has been at the shop 3 0r 4 times and has been worked on by an authorized technician at my home twice. The shaft will not stay on so the cutter wheel does not move. The latest problem is that I can crank it but it vibrates so much that the choke lever will not stay up so it quits. I've bought weedeater products for years because they're light and dependable. Weedeater should discontinue this one or beef it up so it will run longer than a day or two without having to go back to the shop.
4,Purchase these for xmas gifts - each was a hit,"I purchased these for my daughters' boyfriends for Christmas. Each seemed very excited upon opening the gift. They have all mentioned that they have been using them a lot, either at work or college."
2,Amazon misleading price,"I don't understand why Amazon would lie about the price. amazon said it was 60% off the original price of $98 (one day left)--but actually I went to the product's site and 512 m memory knife cost $49. Amazon, shame on you!"
5,Alen Abel Rocks!,"Alan,This book is a classic! You've inspired me with your wit, wisdom and candid crazyness.I would strongly suggest this book to ANYONE who wants to think even more outside the box, raise a few eyebrows, and make a difference with creativity and humor.20/20 John Wingert"
3,Faucet review,"I bought several of these as the price was right. I needed four and could not get a fifth one since they are not being made anymore. If I had to do it all over again, I would have not bought this. The unit works great, don't get me wrong but in retrospect I should have bought a unit that I could buy readily. I belive Kohler will support this purchses, however."
3,Beware of IDLE Hands ...,"The Magic Snake is a real fun toy. You make different shapes from this one object. A twist here, a twist there ... and you have another shape. The book gives a number of shapes you can try to make. More like suggestions. Several shapes are explained. Others you are on your own on how they were made. I am glad my imagination can come up with more shapes than described in the book."
5,Mad Hot,"Like a New Orleans night--Hot and sweet. Let us not lead a serious life, let us have a good time and live a little. Love the life you're living and live the life you love!Buy this."
5,THE KING OF ROCK&N-ROLL,"this disc just blasts out like the Genius on it.the songs&the material go full steam ahead.the words&music of Little Richard are timeless.these songs are some of the greatest recordings ever to the HUMAN ear.FRom TUTTI FRUTTI,Long Tall Sally.his style is still very influential to this day.he is long overdue."
5,Excellent,When you hear L.Richard sing Tuti Frutty and Lucille you are tranported to his time & you feel you are 18 again.
5,Panasonic KX-TG5433BP 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange Digital Cordless Phone System with 3-Handsets and Digital Answering System -,I just think it is a fantastic system. we recently went to VOIP and i had only one hot phone jack in the house. This system solved my problem of phones through out the house while not interfering with my wireless computer network. I'd buy this system again or reccommend to my friends
4,Great discs--terrible packaging!,"Musically and sonically these discs are wonderful. Too bad efforts to be ""artsy"" limit enjoyment of the liner notes. It looks like there's a lot of interesting information here. Unfortunately, I find it hard to read the notes without getting a headache. The colors of the tiny print and of the booklet pages vary, but the worst combination was on the pages that interested me most: those dealing with the recording of ""Shhh/Peaceful"". Tiny white type on a gold background!"
5,Incredible Miles!!,"Ever since I heard In a Silent Way eight years ago in college it has remained one of my all time favorite Miles Davis albums. The music on these three CD's is beautiful, magical stuff. The discs document with great success the music Miles was making during this period of his career. For any Miles fan this box set is pure pleasure. Enjoy."
1,Bad researching.,"I am a member of SABR (Society for American Baseball Research).My area of interest and expertise is minor league history. As such, years ago, I purchased this book with the idea it couldhelp me in my endeavors. BAD IDEA!This book is a clear example of how to publish a book and not know your subject. After a few months of notes, I sent 12 pages of corrections to Mr Obojski, such as in the cities listing(example: Charlotte is in North Carolina not South Carolina.) There are dozens and dozens of these simple mistakes. I received no reply.A second printing without the errors never occurred. So save your money. It isn't worth the aggravation!"
1,Photos do not match product description,"The photos make this item appear to be bed rail protectors. It's not, it is for the upper part of the bed by the window. Photos need to be revised."
3,Does exactly what it says.,"I bought a stack of these Exlipse CD's for Yoga. Mostly I got the ones without soundtracks, because I prefer nature sounds alone. I bought this to try the soundtrack and confirmed for myself that I don't like them much. I find the music a bit distracting, but it is a matter of personal taste.The rain forest track is authentic sounding, and the overall effect is still relaxing, and provides a good wall of white noise for meditation, blocking out the sounds of everyday life from round the house or outside.I think these are a great value collection and a great buy for anyone who practices meditation or relaxation."
5,New Second-Year French,"I searched for and found this textbook for reasons of nostalgia. I work in a research position where my primary language is French. I have now been speaking French now for more than fifty years. These first and second year textbooks by O'Brien and Lafrance were the first French textbooks I ever encountered, and they provided a foundation that is, in my opinion, is second to none. They are much more solid, ambitious, and thorough than any text I know of on the market today. The copy I purchased was in fantastic condition--not a mark in it. It certainly did not look like a textbook that was from the early 1960s. The seller packaged it with great care. He seems to have regarded it as the precious antique that it is! Thanks very much for the rapid shipment, too."
5,Fuerte Mambo,"This CD is not only full of that beautiful mambo sound, but it's filled with hardcore herengue. Excellent Combination... If you like Oro Solido and Banda X.... I recommend this CD to you...."
3,Convincing portrayal of Feudal Japan,"One of the better books in the series. Complex plot with all the major characters fully engaged with both the mysteries and with their own personality conflicts. Weaves considerable amount of Japanese imperial history into the plot in compelling ways. Moves along rapidly, exposing the reader along the way to a convincing portrayal of the complex social and political systems of Japan almost 400 years ago."
1,Modern madness,"Although a number of prior reviewers loved this novel, I found it impossible to enjoy, despite an overwhelming desire to like this book. As a martial artist, I couldn't get past the silly plot. Worse yet, the characters, especially the main characters, are far too modern (and Western). Likewise, the dialog was stilted, direct, and unlikely to be spoken by even modern Japanese. If you aren't looking for historical accuracy, you may be happy with the novel."
2,It's getting to be too much!,This is the fifth or sixth Sano Ichiro book that I read. The only reason that I keep coming back is the futile hope that perhaps the next one will be different. But it is not. The characters in these books have a one-dimensional comic book quality that does not change or mature with age. The antagonism between Sano and the Chamberlain gets to be boring after so many absurd confrontations. The evolution of plot and detective work is always pathetically arbitrary. The only saving grace is what to the reader appears as an interesting view and description of 17th century Japan.
1,Nutshell,"Read 25 pages, fell asleep. Forced myself to read to page 100 - gave up in disgust - checked ending (predicatable).Pluses - historical detail, description of costumes and life.Minuses - totally implausable relationship with wife. Reliance on absurd kill-by-glance BS. Overheated prose.Overall - great concept - unexpectedly lame execution."
3,the samurais wife,excellent and compelling view of feudal japan. almost on a par with van guliks judge dee. preoccupation with reikos wanting to be a man is disruptive and annoying. rowland should find another avenue for her feminist frustrations and keep her excellent interpretation of feudal japan pure.
2,Didn't Move Me,"Ever since I read Shogun I've enjoyed books set in ancient Japan. The Samauri's Wife is really good at capturing life in the Land of the Rising Sun except for one thing:A samurai would've rid himself of a wife like Reiko. Her character is totally unrealistic. The average well to do Japanese lady of this time period did not behave like this at all. Historical fiction is one thing, fantasy fiction is another.On top of this problem, the character of Reiko is annoying. Her prime function seemed to be to get in her husband's way. I found myself hoping that Sano would turn to the bald headed nun. The most compelling love story the book was between Sano's arch rival, the Shogan's second in command and his cunning new lover, Hoshino. There are more books in this series but this it for me."
5,A Ride on the Red Mare's Back,"This is a magical story that I purchased for the daughter of a friend.My friend and her daughter both loved it, too. I recommend it highly for young girls as it teaches them about loyalty, courage, family, and being resourceful -- with just the perfect amount of fantasy."
2,Not very good quality,Received them very quickly but the quality isn't very good. Not near as good as the factory replacement will not buy these again.
4,They Work,"Since I can't buy my filters for my stupid Kenmore humidifier in any stupid Sears stores anymore, these adapt well to the job."
1,"Great music, AWFUL sound quality","For some reason, Madacy has used a ton of noise reduction on these recordings. The piano sounds like its coming through a waterfall or something. Very murky, digital sound. Don't waste your money and get a nicer 2-disc set from EMI."
3,Good to have read it before going to the dealership,Good for me to learn some of the basics before going to the dealership for service and repair. Could be more detailed for some of the basics like getting the whole audio package off the car (I wanted to add a universal MP3 interface kit to it).
3,Adequate,Pretty much what I expected. Would be better if more photos were from the model I actually own (Solara) rather than a Camary.
4,Haynes Toyota Camry repair book,"This book is fine for most simple do-it-yourself repairs. Had a version for my last car and it helped fill in the gaps in the owner's manual. At the least, it gives you some guidance when you need to take the car in for some real repairs, helps to cut through the technician's gibberish."
4,For the little Thomas fans,"My Son loves this place mat. Since he is a big Thomas fan, he knows all of the characters displayed on the mat. The mat seems well made and durable. It has this non slip material on the bottom of it that helps keep it in place. Its a big hit at meal times."
3,Love the idea of it...,"but really, it's easier just to wipe off the table when they make a mess! My son really likes the design-- not just Thomas, but Percy and James, too. We don't use them very often. Maybe we'll use them this summer when we eat outside, just because we already spent the money on them, and don't want to throw them out."
2,"Cute, but cheap.","My 2.5 year old loves it, but it is quite flimsy. I don't anticpate it lasting very long. I would be happier if it cost the dollar that it is worth, instead of $4.00."
1,Poor Quality,I bought this placemat for my son to look at while eating. After a week of use the paint is flaking off all over the mat. I know I should not expect much from this since it is not very expensive. But for it to already be ruined after just a week is unsatisfactory. As for cleaning all I have used is paper towel and water. So it's not like it has been scrubbed in the sink. I would pass on this one unless your just looking for a cheap Thomas placemat.
2,The Cubs wish they were the White Sox,"While the 19th Century era ""When the Cubs Were the White Stockings"" may be of interest to desperate Cubs fanatics, I feel this book holds little general interest, and none for White Sox fans who have plenty to cheer about in the 21st Century."
5,Addams Family Vol 2,This is a killer set. If you like the Addams Family you can't beat the 2nd Season.
4,I got it,"I'm working my way through re-watching these digitally restored episodes and enjoying it just as I did the first set.The extras on the disks are not so interesting, but we're dealing with a fairly old series and so it's not like there's a lot of folks that were involved who can tell lots of stories... I think they did all that on the last disc set and so these extras are kinda just filler and silly stuff."
4,The best I've seen yet,"These two TV shows were livelier and funnier than the previous ones I've bought; perhaps the series got better over time. I expected the show about a gorilla visiting the family (""Morticia Joins the Ladies' League"") to be pretty hokey, but it was funny. ""Fester's Punctured Romance"" was great too. I love it when different characters (Addams and non-Addams) have a conversation in which they both completely misunderstand each other. It's the kind of running joke just gets funnier as it continues and snowballs."
1,addams family volume 2 dissatisfied,I was under the impression that this was the entire 2nd season and it certainly was not. this product was advertised incorrectly and dishonestly.
1,Falsely advertised,"So far I have not watched any of the DVDs but I remember the show fondly from way back.What I am complaining about is that one of the descriptions read that Volume Two had the remaining episodes from Season 1 and the complete Season 2. It does not. It only has 9 episodes from Season 2. I might have bought it if I had known that, but I am not sure.But, almost more importantly, I would definitely not have bought it had I known that the show comes on double-sided disks. I have never had good experiences with those, and I am deeply disappointed."
4,Another Transition,"Although Nee-C is longer a member of the group, this CD shows that Anointed is not through yet. Highlights include ""Things I Wish,"" ""If We Pray,"" ""I'm Praying for You,"" and ""That'll Do It."" Nee-C does contribute background vocals on one song and writing on two. This is a very spiritual album that proves Anointed is not forsaking it's roots."
5,"Nice, but not as good as the last one...","The album starts off with the hot Latin flavored ""If We Pray"" and then the super inspirational, rapture-ready ""One Fine Day"". Next is the beautiful ""You'll Never Thirst"" then it continues into the happy ""Rejoice"" and then the thoughtful ""I'm Praying For You"". Later is the guitar-laden ""Things I Wish"", I'm not sure whether that one could be classified as a ""gospel"" song but it's nice. ""Nothing Can Stop You From Loving Me"" is a nice upbeat song about God's love. Then there's the Ecclesiastical ""A Time For Everything"". Then the hot joint from WoW Gospel 2001 the pre-released ""That'll Do It"" To end the album is the thought provoking ""Let Me Be Love"". Altogether a nice album, but not as good as the last one."
3,Anointed,"In my honest opinion, this CD is okay. However, it does bring back memories of my family's trip to Six Flags over Georgia, because that's all we listened to on the way there. I really do enjoy the words to the songs, because they mean a lot to me. I just think that the beats sound a bit worldly."
4,Don't be afraid to make great music,"This is just a little example that Clannad knows how to make music. They handle the folk and celtic music, but also knows how to rock."
2,Regular Polo Shirt,"The quality of this shirt is poor, I buy one and that comes unfinished. The price es low, but the material and confection are so bad."
1,Below avg. quality,I was not impressed by the quality of the garments and therefore had no choice but to return them. Glad that amazon processed the refunds without any hassle.
3,Sizes are too big!,"very good shirt overall, vivid color, good design, nice soft fabric, the only bad thing is that sizes are too big, I am 5.11"" and 140 pounds and the size ""S"" or Small was a little big, good thing my mother fix it for me"
3,Good value polo shirt,"This polo shirt is a good value. Looks cheap, but is comfortable and functional. The Heather/Oatmeal color has a hemp/earthy feel to it. Helps fill my wardrobe - phasing out printed T-Shirts from my teen years."
2,Wow. Badly written,"Please don't read this book. It was seriously not good at all. Read something else, anything else, before you read this."
5,Great Book on the Outer Banks - Loved It !,"This is a beautiful large softcover that shows the many facets of life on the Outer Banks. The black & white photos are really very interesting - it shows quite a lot of the history to this area. There are even two maps in the back. This book helps to explain the allure to this area - I go as often as I can. It is an American treasure, as far as I am concerned. This book lets you enjoy it even when you can't get there."
4,It seals leaks,"It seems to work well for sealing leaks. I used it in my basement to coat areas where tiny cracks in the walls had appeared during previous rainstorms. One coat tackled all of the areas I was worried about. The next day, it rained. The corner- previously the leakiest spot- was bone dry. 2 other spots had a tiny amount of water. In total, only a couple of tablespoons of water got through, versus the usual amount which can be anywhere from 1-5 gallons. Yesterday, we got an even bigger storm and there was no further leakage. It took me 2 cans to do 1 coat. Each can covered a good amount of space.I'm ordering more so that I can do a second coat, just to be on the safe side. This stuff works better than the special sealant paint from the hardware store."
1,cost me more money because it destroyed my project,this product is no good. it never cured and ended up destroying what i was using it for. this product will be off the market soon
3,Good Basic info but out of date,"This is a quickly evolving space and information from 2003 is not very relevant. Having said that, the fundamental concepts of who, how and why of money-laundering are explained adequately for someone looking for foundational understanding. Beyond that, you are better served accessing the FATF reports directly."
4,Makes the hands feels soft,"I normally use these lotion on my hand because I have a dry skin, so after rubbing it on my hands feels soft."
2,Crunching Leaves Under Feet,"Imagine the sound of leaves crunching under your feet as you walk step by step through the woods. Crunch, crunch, crunch, occasional pauses, then resumed crunch, crunch, crunch. I did not find the crunching to be relaxing, but it is authentic. Nice bird sounds and mellow instrumentals."
4,E-Moderating for Facilitors,"For teachers who are contemplating making use of elearning activities. This is a well presented book and worthwhile. It focuses on distance education learning and tertiary students. It also focuses on what skills are needed by the facilitor to make use of software such as WebCT, Blackboard, Moodle etc. The concepts covered in the text can be easily adapted for high school."
5,Border patrol hat,Delivered as promised. Awesome hat! What else can I say? It's an awesome hat and people look at me differently when I wear it.
2,I Was a Teenage Bloodsucker...,"Sabella is the coming-of-age story of a confused young vampire on Novo Mars. Like many of Lee's books, this one is dream-like and full of supernatural eroticism.Unfortunately, it is almost painfully slow and the first person narration was not very illuminating. I (finally) reached then end of the book and felt like I did not know the characters at all."
2,Disappointing,"The writing is lush and seductive, but this really should have been a short story. The premise is interesting but not really interesting enough for a novella. The first 90 pages drag so much that I almost gave up a couple times. I have enjoyed many of Tanith's stories, but if you're looking for something that will keep you awake try _Tales from the Flat Earth_, they are my all time favorite fantasy novels. Much more plot per page and an originality that is simply mind-blowing."
4,Terrific adventures,"Read this book when I was 14 years old; read it in one sitting, cover to cover. If even half Berg's tales are true, he must have lived an incredible life. Highly recommended!!"
3,Interesting...,"I'm glad there weren't any subtitles, but it was interesting regarding world reaction to a threat to man kind. Like the other viewer, it's sort of ahead of it's time regarding production if you know what to look for...."
3,Handle too long,The handle comes up way to far and makes it look obnoxious when pulling it. We returned ours right away. Just not right.
4,Like Thomas Harris on [drugs.],"Just finished reading this one on the recommendation of a friend and - hooha - it's one crazy book. Take all the obsessive, meticulous research of Thomas Harris, add in the hard-boiled worldview of James Ellroy, and mix it all with a big dose of twisted sexual psychopathology and you get this book. Mind-bogglingly complicated, rich with character and plot, it only misses greatness by having almost TOO crowded a canvass (at a couple of key points, I had to go back in the novel to refresh my memory or catch something I missed - and I am NOT a careless or inattentive reader). Still, where most thriller writers just phone in their books, Slade (a pseudonym) clearly cares about delivering something provocative, frightening, and original."
5,Slade rules,"The first of five or six Special-X books that are among the best thriller/slasher/horron stories ever. The rest of the Special-X books are hit and miss, but all of them through Primal Scream are great. Headhunter just scratches the surface, although its one of Slade's best still."
5,COOL!,"Lets you look at madness as if it is a child you can appraise, and what more, lets everyone see how relativley close they are to 'owning' this child. The characters are eerie and believable, the plot eerie and fast-paced. In a nutshell: you just have to read it!"
2,Tabloid history,"The Roman Empire had a well-developed tabloid press, full of wild and quite explicit sexual rumors. This book is straight out of that tradition and is entertaining as such. How much can you take seriously? Not much. It's not history in any pure sense, but kind of a look back at Rome's tabloid spirit. The Roman tabloid differed from ours in that it lacked our veneer of prudery and puritanism. Even South America's blood-drenched tabloids doesn't have the kind of sexually explicit sensationalism prevalent in the Roman Empire. This book is more like fringe sociology than history. Like a good tabloid of any age, the book is fun and entertaining, but weird."
1,Masturbatory fantacies for the truly sick!,"I am no prude. And I am not in favor of censorship. But this book,aside from offereing up pure garbage in the disguise of history, probably gets a lot of perverts off rather well. Just hope they stay home and stick to their fantasies!"
1,Not for Children or the Squeamish,This book is more porn than history- I found it fairly disturbing. I would not recommend it.
1,Possibly a joke?,"I almost think the authors intended this to be a joke but did not include a disclaimer. Whatever information they didn't get from the 1980's porno, they made up. The Roman people are always referred to as ""plebian scum"" and when Caligula chooses a human woman to begin his dynasty of incest, his horse is ""inconsalable"". The emperor's genitals are referred to as his ""imperial weapon"" and the senators have nothing to do other than choosing a color to paint their new meeting hall or getting ""buggered"" by Caligula. Even if this is a joke, however, it quickly loses any humor it may have since it begins repeating everything after the first page. (or even the introduction) All in all, save your money..."
1,Absolute Buggery,"As a amateur historian specializing in ancient cultures such as the Romans, I found this book to be nothing but pure fiction. While the authors do make it seem as though these events could be true, a little common sense tells the intelligent reader that they are not. What I found even more incredulous was that the authors give absolutely no sources for their information. On the other hand, this piece does work as a pornographic salute to the Romans. Hilarious but not true at all would best describe this book. If you are a fan of murder, sodomy, beastiality, and lurid female conduct then buy this book. If you are more interested in the facts of the ancient Romans, then avoid it like a Lybian lion going for the anus of a young slave."
1,Obscene Drivel,"Just a flick through this vile publication in a library was enough to bring the same conclusion as most readers have done in these reviews. Were the details of torture and mind reeling lifestyles to be true, all semblance of credibility is lost in the gleeful writing style. This really is the pits. I suppose some rather empty, sad lunies will revel in it but - hey -get a life."
1,less than zero,"I'm not unacquainted with 'the Roman sources,' and I can say only that (a) this book is absolutely shot through with wild assertions that, as far as I know, have no basis in Classical texts -- I can often recognize the textual KERNEL for a given baroque description, but, typically, little of the latter is actually stated in the former -- and (b) I'd be flabbergasted if much of the overplus came from anything more authoritative than somebody's overheated imagination."
4,Brings me back to childhood:),This book made me realize how we forget to focus on nature and the earth as we get older. When we are young we are discovering these things and appreciate the wonder of life's miracles. Thanks for writing a book to wake up the senses of mind and body!
4,Work pretty well.,"These work pretty well. They don't get all of the pores I thought they would. I can still extract from some pores manually after using these. They do rip off a layer of skin, thus probably why using them not more than once every 3 days is instructed. Avoid air pockets when applying by carefully pressing to skin as you put it on, sort of like rolling wallpaper, to get in the nose crevices."
5,BIORE RULES!,"Nothing compares with other brand nose strips like ponds or whatever, THis is the real deal, its exellent and 100% recomendable"
5,Biore strips,"I have been using these occasionally for a few years now and have noticed a difference in my pores, especially on my nose. I like how they have added slits around the nose strips to help prevent the wrinkles and bubbles on the strip I used to get. The package recommends not using them more than once every three days. I use them twice a month (or when I remember) and use the Biore triple action astingent immediately after removing the strips. I have had no adverse reactions to this item. You should not use if you have sunburn, blemishes, excessively dry skin or are sensitive to bandages or peel-off masks. Also, stick with the Biore brand, I have tried drug store knockoffs and they ARE NOT the same."
1,Don't dump your money,I bought this product because I read the good reviews.I used the pore strip several times and I think my pores are bigger and redder!I don't like it at all.
1,Waste of money,"When you take this off, it hurts your face, it does nothing to black heads and is a complete waste of money."
1,0 Stars,"These stripsd are kind of pricey, but I did want to clean out my pores so I decided to try it. I wet my nose then put the strip on and waited. It was kind of painful taking the strip off, but I thought that it would be worth it if my pores would become cleaner. But there was no change. None at all, my nose and pores looked exactly the same and there was no dirt or anything on the strips. I wouldn't recommend it. Don't waste your money and time."
1,"snake oil, waste of money, piece of crap.. take your pick","Yeah.. the title says it - don't waste your money on this. Followed instructions: nothing happened. Went around the instructions: still nothing. If you want to waste your money on a product that doesn't do anything, get a pet rock."
2,Is it really working ?,"I purchased one from Wal-mart and keep using it every week. The strip is not sticky enough and sometimes even slip off my nose, I guess a pore cleaner might doing a better job than this.Speaking that, I got to admit I barely have any blackhead on nose, so I could not really tell whether it works."
3,Love-Hate.,"While the Biore Pore Strips actually do work, I would advise looking into the product more. If you have sensitive skin be careful of what you put on your skin after using this or stay away completely. I used this product several times and I am usually happy with the results. However, it irritates my nose and it doesn't stop itching for hours afterwards.I noticed a few reviewers did not have any luck with the product. Make sure you follow the instructions because not wetting or wetting the area too much can have an impact on the outcome."
3,Works well but not for sensitive skin,"They work well to remove blackheads, but my pores didn't look or feel smaller afterwards. They also have a funky hairspray smell that might bother more sensitive people, and I would think that someone with sensitive skin would experience soreness afterwards. That said, it's pretty satisfying to see all the gunk on the strip afterwards."
4,I have always loved these,"You may not like what you find but these are great and do the job well, you dont have to keep it on for the full 15, 10 is fine. way cheaper on amazon than at the other stores like target or cvs"
2,Doesn't work too well.,"Maybe I'm using it wrong, but it's hard to use and kind of annoying. I tried using it after shower, after steam-toweling my face, and nothing seems to really help. I used up the whole pack without getting any real results. Kiehl's Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Masque works a lot better and easier for me, as well as being a more economical choice (that batch lasts forever!) Also, you really can't use the strips for other parts of your face, unlike with the mask. If you aren't already used to this, I'd say go the other route and get a pore cleansing mask or lotion or some other product that works better."
2,Maybe its just not for me,"I got these hoping it would clear my pores a bit or just help reduce any breakouts or oil buildup. But obviously these are more hype than anything. By the time you wash, scrub, and dry your face the issue is already fixed and these strips do nothing more than dry your nose out and make it sticky."
4,Effective for your nose!,"I was told by a woman who waked my eyebrows that I had a lot of blackheads - I had never really noticed, but it started to bother me, so I tried these strips. I was amazed by how much crap they pulled off my face! It was disgusting and fascinating at the same time. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it only covers your nose - I think I have blackheads on my cheeks too, and it would be nice if they would make strips for that too."
1,Didn't work,I guess this product doesn't work on some people. All it did was dry up and then peel off. Pores stillclogged.
4,troublem7820,"This item works great. Def recommend. Doesn't get them all out on the first attempt, but you can totally see the results."
5,Momma Jen,"I have been using Biore strips for years, and I don't know what I did before they came out on the market! I exfoliate on a regular basis but I still get those gnarly blackheads on my nose, cheeks, and chin. I use one full strip on my nose and then I cut one strip into smaller strips and place them on my cheeks, chin and under my nose. I noticed someone on here said that you can't use them with other harsh products... I use Retinol, AHA's, toners, peels... I have never had any kind of adverse reaction. I use the strips about once a week and my pores stay nice and clear... my makeup even goes on smoother. Amazing product. Should be in every woman's beauty arsenal. :)"
4,for the more faint of heart,I've been using Biore strips for years and recommended these for my son; I use the Ultra version and those tend to be a little too strong for him. We both can see a big difference in his pores when he uses these. I think we both really get about the same results because he's able to use these more often.Pleased with this product and highly recommended.
4,Great Product,"So I bought these just to get rid of some pesky blackheads, and they've largely done the job. Its a great product, it really does help with getting rid of blackheads, alot quicker than other products. Although it doesn't get rid of all your blackheads, this is the best blackhead removing product I have ever found, I really do recommend it to anyone who wants to free themselves from blackheads."
1,ughhh,"OMG, I bought this a while ago and I now realize how stupid I was!! The strips hurt soooo bad and I noticed nothing on the strip that it had taken off my face. Blackhead:still there. Dirt and Oil: still there. I can honestly report that this did nothing for me. Please, I'm begging you not to waste your money!!"
3,Good and Bad,"Well these things do work, that's for sure. But at what cost? My tongue is nice and smooth but now I can't taste anything at all."
3,Not very effective,"These seem more of a novelty than anything. Each time I use them they pull more tiny hairs than blackhead gunk. They are easy to use and the slits help the to adjust to any nose. They are a bit painful to remove but it's not intolerable. I will us these up for my ""spa days"" but they aren't life changing or very effective at all. In reality my chemical peels are more effective at doing what these are supposed to do. On the plus side, they haven't caused any breakouts thus far."
2,Unblocked some pores temporarily,"The strips when used properly removes about 60% of the blackheads and unclogs pores. This is temporary though because the pores fill up just as quickly as they were unclogged and many times you'll end up with more blackheads than before. The only way to get clear pores is to use this often which can be irritating to the skin and time consuming, especially for guys. The best way to reduce blackheads is just using a scrubbing face wash a few times a week."
1,"Horrible, does not work","So, I have many blackheads on my nose, I can press them and get the gunk out but they come back. I bought these strips hoping to solve my problem.The first thing I'd like to note is that the strips LOVE to stick to themselves. The first strip I opened stuck to itself immediately and wouldn't come part. The second strip went on fine, it got hard after 10-15 minutes and I peeled the strip off towards the bottom of my nose (like the instructions say to do.It got a few blackheads, but nothing worth paying for (maybe 4-5 blackheads came out). The rest were left unscathed. Also, the strip leaves your skin uncomfortably dry where it was."
2,It's not that strong,"After reading the reviews here, I got it from a local Walmart store. But unfortunately, it desn't work for me. If you never treated the blackheads before, maybe it will work for you. But for those who have tried some ways to fight against blackheads and the skin on their nose is already sort of damaged, probably this won't work for you, go somewhere else to find a stronger blackheads remover."
1,not to good,These dont really work that well. maybe its just my skin or something but they really dont do anything for me at all. i wouldnt recommend them to anyone.
2,not what i expected,"I didn't' get these strips from amazon, I got them from Wal Mart. I used them correctly. It worked a little, but not as much as some video's online or like some people's pictures. not impressed."
1,I placed an order on January 11th 2013 for 3 packets but received only 2 packets on January 28th 2013,I received only 2 out of 3 orders (placed and paid for on January 11 th 2013) on January 28th 2013. I will be following up with Customer Service.
3,Different packaging,Received on time. But the packaging looks different. Never mind they changed the look. Wow that was drastic change. For a known brand to suddenly change into different look is strange.
2,DO NOT USE!,"Although, yes these strips work to get the dirt out of your pore, they stretch out your pores when you pull them off and getting rid of enlarged pores is almost impossible. And when you stretch out your pores it is easier for them to catch dirt and its just not good! Do more research!"
5,I Love These Strips!,"The pores on my nose don't get that clogged, but I still use these once a week because it is the only way my boyfriend will do them with me. the pores on his nose are large and clogged, and these clean them out real nice!For me, there is usually only one of two little blackheads pulled out, but my boyfriend's strips come out delightfully disgusting and I have found that his nose pores are looking better and less noticeable.I wish I could post pictures!After use, the activated glue does leave a nose slightly red and dry, so it is a good idea to clean and moisturize after every use."
3,ehh,"It's okay, works for some blackheads I never even knew I had but at the same time, does not remove the blackheads I intentionally used it for! So they definitely work, but probably not very well, at least for my nose :( wish it worked better."
2,Didn't work for me,"I was really disappointed by this product after hearing all the hype. I have very large pores on my nose and expected a lot of junk on the strip when I removed it. Nearly nothing. I need to try it again, and will update after I do, but it's hard to get motivated to use them again after the first experience. :-("
3,Might work for some people... but not me,"If you have black heads chances are that its genetic. Our skin naturally replenishes itself and the oil build up creates black heads. I used these and saw the gross little white or black 'trees' all over the strip, but it did nothing for the day to day black heads I always have. It removed the biggest ones, but my nose was still covered in black heads. I used three of them a week for three weeks and I still have just as many."
3,Addicting,"I don't know why I keep buying these, its some sort of sick need to see all the junk that accumulates in my pores. These strips are supposedly really bad for your face, and yet, I buy them. I find they work fairly well WHEN they work. According to the directions, you wet the area of your face you'd like to clean, and stick this on for about 10 minutes until the strip gets hard (like paper mache). Sometimes, the sticky goop that comes on the back of the strips stays stuck to my face. Therefore, the strip doesn't remove any of the dirt stuck in my pores, and I have glue and gunk stuck on my face. My skin gets really irritated and red after having to scrub the glue off. But when they do work, they make for a fun girls night. These strips + nail polish + funny movie = lots of laughter."
4,Pretty good with multiple applications!,"These are like magic, in fact its kinda freaky the first time you do it because you can see the stuff that came out of your pores and they stand up due to the glue. These things are so much easier than sitting there for hours picking at blackheads. All you do is wet it, place it on your nose, wait 15 mins for it to dry then rip it off for your ""surprise"". I also recommendOxy Maximum Daily Cleansing Pads, 90 padsthese will keep those pores clean after removing them with this product."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought these for fun, on the urging of my girlfriend. They're fun, though I might not buy them again. And even though they remove gunk from your nose, it's not clear to me that a dry bumpy nose is any better looking than a smooth oily nose. Anyway, she says I look better, so who am I to doubt?Happy nose pore unclogging!"
4,Decent Stuff,"I recently had a nose job and my doc said not to pinch or squeeze my nose for 3 months but I have been getting black heads from the taping etc so I was still pinching my nose , then I remembered the strips! I used one and so many black heads came out it was awesome you could see them on the strip. I wish the strip was bigger to cover the whole tip of your nose thats why I gave it 4 stars! It only covers the top whether your nose is big or small! It worked really well for my boyfriend who has deeper blackheads I was surprised that the strip pulled them out. The strips are a little pricey but they are worth it if you cant or dont want to simply pinch your nose."
3,"Depends on the day, I guess...","I have very mixed reactions about the Biore Deep Pore Cleansing Strips. I do wear makeup, wash my face at least twice daily (once at night, once in the morning) and have been using this product for two years on and off. I can't say that it has helped me out much. The only possible way that these strips help is right when you get out of the shower... when your pores are open (from the steam) and the crap inside can be yanked out. I wouldn't recommend anyone to just use these after they wash there face, I'd have little to no results this way.I think this product is a real hit and miss between people. You either like it or not."
5,great product,"I have tried everything to remove my blackheads on my nose but with poor results as my nose would look the same after a few days when I used facial scrubs. These pore strips are really great, they don't remove everything by using it once but after using these strips 5 times in three weeks my nose is almost free from blackheads.I have tried pore strips from other companies with bad results but in my search all over the internet I found these to be the best of all. To have the best results the pore strip shall be applied just after walking out of a hot shower on the wet skin."
4,Works ok,"The strips got off only some of the blackheads on my nose, but not all of them. Sorta disappointed because there were so many great reviews."
4,Great product but I wish Biore provide more strips for the price..,"I'm that kid that used to pick his acne a lot when he was a little kid. Now my nose has big pores from picking and it tends to clog from the moisturizer/sunscreen that I put on everyday. This product does the job AS LONG AS YOU OPEN UP YOUR PORES. The best way to do this is to put this strip on your nose right after shower.IF YOU'RE GETTING SKIN PEELS/NEEDLING- Do not put this on after any kind of skin treatment (ex. tca peel, needle..etc.) even after a few days. This will harm your skin."
4,It does what it is supposed to do.,I used it for the first time ever. It dis make my nose structure cleaner.It is easy to usePacking is good.Product looks of good quality.Giving it only 4 and NOt 5 stars because its not something out of the world.I will be ordering it again!
1,"I initially thought ""it enlarged my pores!"" was an exaggeration","I thought, hey, all it does is pull the damn blackheads out, how is that supposed to enlarge pores?Sadly the result of my naivete showed up not more than a week later: my pores, which had stayed about the same size since my teenage years, have multiplied in size and visibility. I have compulsive issues with my skin and had been hoping that these strips would help, but... au contraire. Just catching sight of my nose now makes me feel slightly nauseated now, and of course that has been no help to the compulsions. I don't even know if I'll ever be able to return my skin to the way it was before I used these."
3,Didn't work for me,I purchased this product hoping to get rid of blackhead on my nose but It didn't work at all. I am very disappointed.
1,Didn't work for me,I bought this product because it was on sale and I wanted to give it a try since my nose is covered in deep blackheads. I followed the directions and pulled the strip off. There was a bunch of little things on the strip that looked like little hairs. I looked back at my nose and didn't notice any change. I still had a ton of blackheads. I tried this for 3 weeks and nothing changed. Maybe there is no hope for my nose or maybe I need to try it longer.
3,Expected more...,"Not a bad product. Does not hurt, does not irritate skin but sadly also doesnt clean my pores...I will not use it again."
4,Better design since I've last tried...,"I haven't bought a box of Biore pore strips in over 5 years. I am impressed on several new factors: There is better coverage to more adequately cover the nose area, strips stick much better, and lastly there is no gooey residue that I remember being left behind on the older strips.I gave it 4 stars because I like the improvements, however I feel that it didn't quite get everything. My pores looked cleaner and there was a definite removal of gunk, but I feel like they didn't remove as much as they did on the older version.Bottom line, these strips work and get some of the dirt out but it will not be a deep clean."
2,Not good enough,"It cleaned out a few pores, mostly along the side of the nose. Nothing along the bridge of the nose. Will not be purchasing this product."
5,Scary Amazing,I love these strips because they're so easy to use and very effective. Its scary to see the stuff these strips will pull out of your pores.TipsWash gently and thoroughly before applying the strip.Once the strip is in place let it dry completely!Remove slowly.After removing the strip some of the material will stay stuck to your skin. Wash thoroughly again to avoid clogged pores.
3,didnt really work,These things did not seem to work for me. All it seemed to do was make my nose really red. But they are worth a shot!
4,Nice Bubble Lights,"These bubble light bulbs arrived well-packaged and intact - no broken stems like some other reviewers experienced. So far, they bubble vigorously and spontaneously within a few seconds of turning on (which is better than some of my older bulbs, which sometimes require a vigorous shake to start the stream of bubbles). They appear well made and are attractive in a retro 1950s sort of way, which is the whole idea. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the liquid in the blue-stemmed bulb is so dark that it is difficult to see the stream of bubbles."
3,Love the Bubble Lights,The replacement bulbs are expensive and they sometimes burn out faster than the originals. This year we bought an extra string of 7 lights to use as replacements as this seemed more economical.
1,Bad bubble light,One of the bubble lights does not have any liquid in it. I will be exchanging it for another one. Need to work on quality control.
5,Replacement bubble bulbs,To replace broken bulbs. Very happy with the product. Haven't needed to use any yet. I am able to relieve my youth.
5,Bubble Lights,I received the product on a timely basis. The bubble lights worked perfectly...I highly recommend this product to Christmas Bubble Lights lovers!
2,am sad,"i use the old stlye bubble lights for night lites, and there nice looking. am sad to report that these new ones wont even make the fluid in the lite bubble?? whats up with that.. maybe osha got involved.."
2,I Tried Them Anyway,"I read the reviews and decided that even if they didn't bubble they would resemble the other working lights and they weren't that expensive. The other people that wrote reviews were correct - no amount of tapping, twisting, or various other stimuli would force these Chinese lights to bubble. They do look somewhat similar to the older bulbs but do not match. They do light up. If that is good enough for you, then buy them but don't expect them to work unless you are familiar with some sort of incantation that will give life to this foreign-C7 Replacement Bubble Bulbs Mu (3-bulbs)made junk."
5,replacement bulbs,I learned my lesson always buy replacement bulbs when buying new lights. Good thing as I needed them. They worked fine in an older set of lights too.
3,"It's okay, but not great.","I gave these bulbs to my parents, so can't really say how they work. I know at least one bulb came to them without any fluid in it. I ""guess"" the others work fine though. If some bulbs don't start bubbling after a few minutes, all you have to do is wiggle it or gently flick it with your finger and it will start working. They may need a little attention to get them all working, but since it's a novelty item, it's worth it. My parents were surprised that I even found some of these. Dad didn't think they were made anymore since the ones they have were at least 30-40 years old. So they were surprised when these bulbs came to them in the mail. I don't know if there are any other brands that work any better than these do. I've read reviews and it seems all have some kind of trouble."
2,bubble lights,"Picture is wrong; I thought I was ordering 7 lights and instead was ordering a box of 3; the description was changed, but the picture is still showing 7 lights; I'm very dissappointed in advertisers that do not show the correct pictures with what they are selling on Amazon.com. They should correct it."
2,Disatified,"The service directly from Amazon was outstanding, shipment was very fast. However, from the company they came from 1 of the bulbs in the package had no liquid in it. No hassle at all in returning the product."
3,Needed before Christmas. Got the two bulbs I needed.,Item arrived late but before Christmas. I had two bulbs burned out on my current strand. Lucky for me because only two of the bulbs in the box worked. Quality of bulbs seems ok. They got the job done.
4,"2 RCA Male / 3.5mm Stereo Male, 25 ft","I bought this in December 2009 in conjunction with a DVI to HDMI 25foot cable, since DVI does not carry sound, only HDMI does this for high quality connections. The cable works just fine like it was intended to. I've had no interference with the cable in my bedroom while I've had it connected to my Sony Bravia LCD tv."
1,Poor Shielding,"Cable has very poor shielding which causes there to be a constant squealing to come out of the speakers, whether the music is playing or not - and it's loud enough that even with music playing its very noticeable. Spend an extra couple bucks and get a higher quality cable!"
5,Just the right length,"If you want the longer length you have to buy this item from Amazon. The electronic stores only have 6 foot lengths, which was way too short for my needs. I bought two, and used both of them the same day. Now I have to order more for a spares. My electronic needs are legendary."
5,Good & Cheap,Just what I needed. Still works 2 years after receiving it. Great price too. Couldn't ask for a better deal!
2,Potential but utter failure,"Good cable, no interference for 25'! BUT the right channel doesn't work after 1 week. So NO don't buy, spend money on a bit better cable."
3,Works but disappointed,"I got this to connect my laptop to my TV. It works. BUT it is not brand new for sure. the packaging was bad. the plugs had scratches on them and what appears to be some sort of oil. I know that my TV is old, my laptop about five years old so the sound quality won't be superb, but at at least send it in a decent condition. I guess you get what u pay for."
2,Not worth the money,"Not many diffrent activities that children can do by themselves mostly adult directed, overall not the best book to purchase if you want rainy day activities"
4,No pages in Kindle version!,"I always find it preferable to get the kindle version of a book, if available and for one thing I am so much indulged by the convenience of e-delivery. But this time, I must say regret, and a big one too. There are no pages in the kindle version of this very adorable book. It is absolutely not possible to make references to the contents and this is just one of those books which you would be revisiting and quoting from so many times later. Or I have missed something in the hardware or software or whatever. Oh, appreciate help. (sorry if this is not exactly a book-review)"
5,Papaya's HERO is chock full of bouncy Eurotrash goodness,"""Hero"" by Papaya is my favorite dance record so far this year. It's silly, Scandinavian bouncepop. Kinda brainless, kind of a guilty pleasure thing, but definitely worth getting. Plus, Papaya looks really groovy on the cover. (Honestly, I would have bought this just for the design.)"
3,It makes you loves gospel music even if you hate it,"Have this CD immediately because it is valuable on guiding you to live by GOD""S principles.It's songs will makes you feel like you are going up in HEAVEN.Keep up good work KIRK!MAY GOD BLESS YOU!"
5,I love ya'll music contuine,I want yall to keep praising the lord don't stop and i want every song that comes out but i only want it when it's slow music. you know what i mean. Love Lashawnda Taylor May God bless us....
5,Praise be to God!!,"I don't know what's wrong with the people who have a problem with the way Kirk Franklin uses moves of the world in his music and videos. You can't title everything you see on tv to be ""of the world"" and the world does not own the moves that we see. therefore, KF has every right to use what he does. As long as he is glorying the Lord and not the world then it is alright. Just like David danced in the fire God ain't ever say that it was wrong. Some of the moves that we see on tv such as the ""bankhead bounce"" really originated in the church when people lifted up there hands to God and then when the spirit touhed them they just lifted Him higher by pushing up their hands. So in conlclusion, I applaud you Kirk Franklin, becuse you have touched many young people nd got them to move out of the world and into the WORD!!"
5,"Amazing, awe inspiring, toe tapping, get your praise on","From the minute I popped this disc into my Cd player until the minute it was over, I was completely involved in the variety of emotion, the feeling, the true and honest quality of the artists and the songs. Among the best are ""Revolution,"" ""Lean on Me,"" ""Hold Me Now,"" and ""Something About the name Jesus."" God's smiling Kirk, keep on praising him."
1,Kirk Franklin needs prayer.,"Personally I feel that the Nu Nation Project CD is all about show and not about praising God.First of all he starts off with that whole trial, how does that uplift the name of God.The purpose of singing is not just to make noise,but infact it is to uplift God and to witness to the unsaved.I would love to ask Mr. Franklin what is the purpose of his CD? Is it to save lost souls, to minister to the Christians,or to make money."
4,Nu Nation project is a Godsend,"I really believe this is a great CD, I thought Kirk and his annoited guests did an unbelievable job. I can tell Bro. Franklin put a lot of hard work into this project. God bless you."
5,THE BEST ABLUM,"I think that this is the best ablum that Kirk has ever made.This ablum is truthly a blessing to me every time I'm down I listen to his songs and they just lift my sprit up. I meet KIRK in Montgomery, Alabama at one of his concerts.He is a real nice person. But to all of you tennagers who are going through something keep your haed up God is on your side."
4,This CD is awesome,"OK, I haven't heard the whole CD, but the song I have heard Revolution is an awesome rappy/rock song but it's gospel. It's really good for the new generation of Christians who like rock and rap."
1,Disappointed and waste of money,"Praise 103.9 FM in Philly plays this version of Love Remix in their rotation. After much research for the song I purchased this cd for this one song, ""Love Remix"", but there was only about 40 seconds of the song on the cd. I was totally disappointed, but didn't want to go through the hassel of returning. Does anyone know where I can find this version of the song?"
3,A CD THAT LACKS WHAT THE OTHERS HAD,"I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD. I LOVED ALL OF THE OTHER CDS BY KIRK FRANKLIN. I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED THE VERY FIRST ONE. THE BEATS IN THIS CD WERE SLAMMIN AND THERE WERE A FEW GOOD SONGS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST WANT TO NOD YOUR HEAD AND MOVE YOUR HIPS, THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND YOU WANT SOME MEAT WITH YOUR BEAT, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CD FOR YOU. I AM A TEEN AND I AM VERY INTO MUSIC, BUT I WANT THE WORDS IN THE SONGS TO MEAN SOMETHING. THIS CD DID NOT DO IT FOR ME. IN MY OPINION KIRK FRANKLIN SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHY HE DOES WHAT HE DOES... WHO HE IS DOING THIS FOR. THIS CD JUST DID NOT MINISTER TO MY SOUL AS I FEEL EVERY CHRISTIAN ARTIST'S MUSIC SHOULD."
4,This album rips.,"Kirk Franklin and his Nu Nation Project has shown that it can make it in the Christian Music scene. It is now time for the album to hit the secular scene. The R & B in this album can combat secular artists such as Puff Daddy, Warren G, Snoop Doggy Dogg, etc. This album rips."
1,Not spiritually edifying!!,This album is nothing more than Kirks way to straddle the fence between righteousness and unrighteousness. I wouldn't recommend this CD if you are looking for songs as encourageing as the songs that the family sang. Kirk drop the nation and come back to the family. Dissappointed DJ
4,The Best of Them ALL!!!!,"Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation Project is by far the best of Franklin's recordings. There is a variety of styles---one is bound to find a song they enjoy. From the inspiring Lean on Me to the soulful Riverside, the Nu Nation Project is a MUST for every Gospel lover."
5,amazing! Kirk is great,"Kirk franklin's ''The Nu Nation''cd is the greatest Ihave ever bought. He has alot of spiritual and uplifting words in his songs. Whoever says he is trying to turn gospel into rap,well they must be deaf because he is a great artist."
5,Most Satisfied,This is a great way to purchase a CD. Sometimes you buy a CD and there's only one song that you like. This way you can determine if it's worth the price you pay for a full lenght CD.
5,Awesome,"I was on a mission trip in Mississippi, and the coach bus that we had to get down there, the driver had a tape of this, and Kirk Franklin has some great songs! From the bus driver always playing this tape throughtout the week to and from our worksite and VBS, and just made me want to go out and buy it myself. You should buy it also, you won't regret it!"
4,It has gone another level.,"THIS IS FROM THE GOSPEL GROUP DAMASCUS FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS. Gospel music for a while was an old christians gospel. But right now it seems to me that we have found a true New Revolution of stars,rappers,R&B artist speaking up now. Kirk may not be the first one to preach this same gospel to these people, but he is most definitely the first one to reach the underground type as well as the elite in this way. James Cleveland and the Dynamic Clark Sisters are some of the early artists that paved the way for all of us, but Kirk has kicked the door down and now we are invading and attacking satan like crazy! It's on NOW!! Are you apart of the new Revolution?"
5,Inspiration,"This is one of the best gospel albums I have ever listened to. The songs are very inspiraring. You need this album, or CD, at home and listen to it all day long."
5,THE NU-NATION PROJECT WAS BLESSED,THE BEAT GOT THE SECULAR SCENE INTERSESTED AND IT HELPED INHANCE MY INTERPERTIVE DANCE SKILLS TO AN ALL TIME HIGH. GOD BLESS
5,Judge not that ye may not be judged.,"Kirk Franklin has taken gospel music to a place where it has never been before. He uses secular artists to get his message of God across. No one knows what else he will do with his music, but everyone had better watch out. We can't say that what he is doing is right or wrong, the only thing that we can do is pray. The Bible says judge not that ye may not be judged! It is not up to us to judge what he does. We just have to look to God and pray for him."
4,"Trendy, but definitely inspired!","It took me a while to get past the faster jumpier tracks on this CD, but I understand the artist's intent and although I have more traditional tastes (I am under 30 years old) I was able to appreciate the message behind the music. My favorite tracks were ""He loves me"" and ""Hold me now"". I introduced two of my friends (also under 30 years old) to the CD and we were all transported when we heard the inspiring lyrics set to a solid and beautifully written jazz score. This artist has definitely grown musically since his earlier albums. I pray that as his Christian walk also develops he will continue to allow the Lord to truly use him and his talents to reach people and not be influenced by the industries of this world. Good job Kirk! I hope your next album shows your versatility and ability to reach those of us who still have more 'traditional tastes'."
1,In the world but not of the World.,"I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. There are about 15 songs on this CD, but only five were good. God calls His children to be in the world but not of the world. There is nothing wrong with shouting or dancing for God. But there is something very wrong when you take things of the world and use it to praise God. Most of Kirk Franklins beats came straight off some of the rap and R & B songs playing on the radio. There is no concord between light and darkeness. God calls his people to be peculiar. We should not seek worldly fame. When Kirk Franklin first came out I loved his music. But now it seems as if it is no longer about God. He seems as if it is all about him. This record is a far cry from his first album."
2,No religion at all!!,"When Kirk Franklin first came on the scene I thought, this man is adding a dimension to gospel music. But with this latest album, especially with R. Kelly, Bono, Mary J. Bleige and others it just goes to show that now he's all about the money. The afore mentioned artist have about as much religion as Al Sharpton!! It's a shame that he has already forgotten where he came from, what he's been through and who holds the power. Maybe that stage fall did'nt knock some sense into him after all!!"
3,Catchy but Not Much Substance,"I did not think it was possible to hear Kirk Franklin become even more secular or mainstream. With the exception of three songs, I feel they had little to really grab or stir the soul. I think Kirk needs to go beyond....""If you've been delivered, stomp"".... I admit though the songs are catchy and if this album grabs a few non-believers, then his album will be well worth it."
5,OFF THE HOOK!!!,"Brilliant, Kirk! Blessed and brilliant! I work with youth at my church and we think that you actually ""Stomped"" Stomp! The music is alive, throughout the CD. I love all kinds of gospel music, from traditonal, to country, to alternative, to choirs, to hip-hop, to reggae. I think there's room for all of it in the kingdom, so don't let anyone dissuade from your mission. To top it off, you and my main man, Fred Hammond (the gospel dream team) blew the roof off with ""My Desire."" Our youth will definitely be in the house, ""Gettin our praise on"" when you hit the Miami Arena on April 17. Remember,don't let anyone dissuade from your mission."
2,"Nice CD, but a little bit too secular for me.","Kirk Franklin is a very talented young man. His music sounds too wordly. It's nice that he's trying to reach the young people, but they can't even tell the difference in what they already listen to, from what he's putting out. They have no reason not to listen to it. It sounds just like their kind of music. There is no anointing behind it. No lives are being changed, nobody is being set free and delivered. I just believe it dosen't take all of this to win souls. It's time for someone to stand up and make a difference the right way."
5,KIRK FRANKLIN IS A BLESSING TO OUR YOUTH,"FEBRUARY 19,1999 I HAVE PURCHASED MOST OF MR. FRANKLIN'S ALBUMS AND I THINK THAT HE HAS REALLY REACHED OUT TO OUR YOUTH. OUR YOUTH ARE THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND WE NEED STRONG CHRISTIAN PEOPLE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY. I COMMEND THE WAY HE HAS TURNED SO MANY OF OUR YOUTH TO CHRIST THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF HIS MUSIC. GOD BLESS HIM AND HIS FAMILY AND I PRAY THAT HE CONTINUES TO BE IN THE WILL OF GOD WITH HIS MINISTRY."
3,Wanna Hear Something Fun??,Listen to Revolution then take the message out. Woo ooo... It is just an over-all fun CD with an intense message
5,Just What I needed,"Great CD !!! I bought this CD for the song ""Something About the Name of Jesus"". It is a very uplifting song. I hadn't heard of this song until recently and was hoping the CD would still be available. A friend of mine ordered it online at another website and then received a notice that it was out of stock. This was about a month ago and she still hasn't received it. I got mine in a few days and am very pleased. Of course I told her she should have ordered from Amazon.com !! I downloaded it onto my IPOD and listen to it often. Like most CD's there are a couple of songs that I don't care for so I didn't put them on my IPOD."
5,From beginning to end...this CD is going off!!,"Kirk Franklin is one of the best talented producers out today!Track after Track, he's manifesting his talent as a producer on this CD. The first time I heard it was at my cousin's wedding and I just knew I had to buy it. I didn't know which KF CD to buy, so I basically just took a chance when I bought this one, and I hit it right on the nail! Every song is a blessing and He's reaching to the young and the old, there's no excuse! Thank God for minister Kirk Franklin, because it was he who captivated me into listening to Gospel music. And that's all I listen to now. GB!!"
3,A little disappointed,"The CD, while being typical Kirk Franklin (great), was a little disappointing. The song called ""Stomp"" on the CD is not the ""Stomp"" from the radio that is so popular. The way its titled on the CD is confusing. That was the song I was looking for, and unfortunately the only song I knew on the CD. So now I have a CD that I didn't want and I have to buy the CD with the correct song. Money wasted - Bummer man!"
5,In the top of the blues,"This is one of my all time favourite blues albums. Every track is a masterpiece. The fist four are produced by a young Ray Charles, who was then to make millions with records that may had some thing to do with these. Slim screams with passion, laughs and cries the blues like no one before him. He is one of the very first guitarists that dare to put a distorted sound on record. Listen to the story of my life and trouble dont last. Slim had everything. If he had not die, he could had been one of the most succesful blues artist ever. Put this record with the complete recordings of robert, the chess box of muddy, live at the regal of bb. Become a fan."
1,texace on Guitar Slim/Sufferin' Mind,"Born and raised on piney woods and cajun rice in the '50's between Leesville and Ville Platte, Louisiana and this is the worst rendition of the great Guitar Slim that I can imagine. I was there and this is not it."
4,Where Re-makes come from.,"I'm very happy with my Liggins purchase. I get great boogie like ""Shuffle Shuck"", as well as orignal songs that new artists like the Mighty Blue Kings remake, such as ""I Can't Stop It."" For swing dancers and DJs, of which I am both, it's a LOT of great Lindy-able jump blues!"
5,Good product,"Well made with many options for screws, a lot more than shown in the picture, good product.,"
5,Brenda Kahn continues to write great stuff,"Brenda Kahn's latest effort is her best since her breakthrough, Epiphany in Brooklyn (1992). Her songwriting has never been more solid, and several tracks are just brilliant. As usual, she's at her best when she's somewhere betwen solemn (e.g., ""Light"") and haunting (e.g., the title track ""Hunger"")."
2,russian christmas music,"I love Russian Christmas Music. But, this recording of it is really bad. I do not recommend this recording at all. This recording ruined it for me. It starts out nice, but then the oboe enters. The woodwinds in general are out of tune throughout the piece. The only good thing about this recording is the interpretation of the piece. You get a full understanding of what Alfred Reed wants. But, the horrible intonation just ruins this piece."
3,Russian Christmas Music,"The Music was good, I enjoyed it, I sampled it before I ordered it. It came a day later than was told but no problem."
5,What a difference!,"Tired with all the trouble of Windows I wanted to take the risk of changing for a new OS. A friend recommended me Mandrake since I've never used or seen Linux and I was amazed how easy it was.First it recognized all my hardware, even my HP CD writer. Also using it wasn't hard or complicated. I strongly recommend this product to people that have no idea of Linux. It has never shown an error or illegal operation, as Windows constantly does.I even want to get in the developer stage but that will take some time. Thanks for bringing us users a strong and confident OS."
1,Linux is a false economy,After 3 weeks (probably 40+hrs at the computer) I have had the following expericences to share; 1) I have a 1 year old Dell computer Linux doesn't recognise my modem. If you have an internal modem chances it will not work with mandrake linux(and all linux distribs's). 2) I have not been able to get it to recognise my CD writer. 3) One of Linux's strengths is being able to use the Apache web server right?....Wrong! Click on install Apache 1.3.12 in this product it will say... install disk 1 I put in disk 1 click o.k. and nothing happens.If you want to get frustrated and stressed and feel stupid(particularly if you ask someone in the linux community or a linux shop for help) then buy Linux.But if your time (like mine) is worth more than about $5 an hour don't buy this product. Even if Microsoft is and has been anti-competitive at least you can get your job done with there products.
1,Disappointed: Does not fit my Hair Dryer!!!!!,"I feel like the pictured image is deceptive. I have been attempting for a while to get my completely average hairdryer to fit into this hair rack, but it will not fit. I can't imagine that my hairdryer is the only one in the world that doesn't fit into this thing. Perhaps mine has a wider barrel, but it doesn't fit into the front section (I'm not sure what even will? A tube of hair gel or a comb or something?) and because it won't go in, it protrudes b/c the cord-holder area sticks out, pushing my hairdryer on a diagonal.Will have to return :-/."
5,Love it,I like this so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhThankyou for make this product so efficient for me....I would recommend this item to my frenz
4,Bought it for the lady friend,"It worked well for the week or two that she decided to use it.But after awhile, it became to cumbersome/tiring to unwrap and rewrap the cords after each time.This holds several bottles, your hair dryer and straightening iron. If you plan on using this the way it's pictured, it works great.Sometimes the straightening iron can fall out if you bump against it since it's just resting on the holding arms."
4,"Gives me my counter space back, but not as neat as pictured","I like this organizer, because it fits my hair dryer, flat iron, curling iron, hair brush and about 4 miscellaneous styling products. It was easy to install and it holds steady. Just be aware that the image is, of course, a bit misleading. Notice that the curling iron pictured does not have a cord. When you install this rack, you will have a larger amount of cords. I got my curling iron cord to wrap around the bottom rack with a little encouragement. I wish the bottom rack would have a curved edge like the top rack does, for ease of cord wrapping. Otherwise, this rack fit my needs and freed up valuable counter space."
4,"Mostly good, but it's another bring your own hardware project","This item is well designed for it's function and fit nicely inside my bathroom vanity's door. It also gets kudos for including shorter screws along with the long ones meant for wall mounting, although I still went with even shorter ones than those provided.But, there are only two screw holes at the top of the rack! Not enough IMO to support the weight without eventually falling off, not to mention constantly torquing the screws as the bottom can flap back and forth. I devised a system with a few more screws at the bottom to support it, but I'm left once again wondering who designs these products. It would have been very simple to add an additional support bar along the bottom of the rack (where the curling iron is supposed to go) to make this a truly sturdy rack."
5,Works in my Daughter's Room on Wall Really Well!,"I bought this for my teenage daughter's room - she has so many electric hair appliances and they were just laying on the floor, the bed, etc. - drove me crazy. I bought this, along with another rack made for kitchen cling wraps, and what a difference this makes! She now puts her hair dryer and 2 other curling devices, in this holder and a flat iron on the bottom wrung and everything is nice and tidy now! Easy for her to use and put back her tools too. I mounted to her wall with enclosed screws and a drill - done!"
4,Functional,This may not be the prettiest thing that you hang up in your bathroom but it works just as promised. I wanted something that was not too expensive but would look ok and get some of the clutter off of my bathroom counter. That it does. I can't really wrap the cord around the holder like in the picture but I mounted this just above the plug in on the wall and I am able to wrap the cord for the hair dryer and curling iron around themselves and still leave them pluged in and ready to use.
5,A five star debut!,"Suffice to say that this cd is one of my top ten of all time. Not a track to skip among them my personal favorite are ""Great are You"", ""Calmer of the storm"", ""Protest to praise"", ""Making me"", and ""All the reasons why"". In an age where cds contain a few great singles and a lot of filler this entire cd is worth owning. The lyrics are deep and encouraging. The two vocalist approach works well and compliment each other and the acoustic rock based (similar to but not exactly like Jars of Clay)music make it a perfect cd for all occasions."
2,Elevator music,"Unlike most artists, Downhere is getting better as time goes on! I purchased the newest C/D after hearing ""my last amen"" on the radio, not knowing that Downhere was already an established band! That C/D is awesome! So, I reseached them to see If they ever had released a previous C/D only to find that there were many! So, since the newest was SO good, I bought them all! Well besides a few rays of sunlight shining through here and there on previous C/D's, they just didn't have ""it"". I don't know what they changed on the new C/D, but EVERY song is acceptional! So kudos to finding yourselves (most artists best C/D's are there first, then dissapoint along the way), but unless you are an insomniac and need music to fall asleep to, I'd pass on this one!"
5,Outstanding,"What can I tell you about downhere? I saw U2 back in 1987 at the Hoosier Dome with the other 45,000 concertgoers and even though U2 was playing for 45,000 they had a way of connecting with the audience to make you feel like they were performing for just you. Well, Downhere has that same gift. It's difficult to explain and that's why I highly recommend seeing them live! If concerts aren't your thing, it least go get a couple, or all, of their CDs. On this indie release I really like the version of Larger Than Life. It rocks a bit more especially after the bridge! You just can't go wrong buying any of their CDs."
5,"Outstanding vise, lasts a lifetime","I purchased this vise for home as it was similar to one (same brand) that I used for many years while working as a machinist. It's very well made, solid construction, great holding power, jaws are aligned and square, and hold square when clamping; just a good addition to a drill press setup. For a drill press, it's much more useful than some of the cheaper ""drill press"" vices which can only be used while flat...this vice will hold items either flat or turned 90deg on either side, and has grooves for holding round stock securely. I know from the way its made, and from my experience with the one I used previously, that I'll be able to pass this on to my kids, so the small additional cost is well worth it."
4,super!,"This CD was great, very Fall Out Boy, really fun to listen to. I love all of their music, and this did not disappoint!"
1,horrible!!,OMFG!! do NOT buy this trash its horrible emo krap! seriosly i returned this album as soon as i lisin to it
2,a fever surpasses infinity,"I was a big fan of under the cork tree, so i got this album...I'll admit that im into pop music so get over it already! This band does make pop songs and does make rock songs, and honestly, i was expecting some songs to AT LEAST sound like their previous tracks like ""this aint a scene"" or ""dance, dance"" but the songs, although original, are not that great. Speaking from a person that likes catchy tunes, this album really disappoints. It certainly has prototypical Panic! at the disco elements, meaning some theatrical songs. At times, i thought i was also listening to Gym Class heroes. Overall, I wouldnt buy this album. If you are smart, you would burn this album instead of buying it because its really not worth it if you are into catchy songs. I hope this helps!!"
3,Please enter a title for your review,the majority of the songwriting on this album is surprisingly inept and rudimentary. the songwriting skill of Dance Dance and genre-defying creativity of This Aint A Scene are mostly absent from the rest of the album. track 9 is the clear stand-out and it's so different to the rest of the album that i wonder if some outside writers weren't involved. track 8 is also really good. the rest is as bad as sugarcult. choruses are typical four-chord cycles and the rigid vocal or guitar melodies are the only parts that don't more often than not use 2 second rhythmmic loops. next to New Found Glory these guys are still rank amateurs with a lot they'll never learn about writing a good pop song.
3,Wow... and not in a good way,"I will tell you, I was extremly excited to get Infinity on High, I loved the single and I've been a fan for two and a half years. I popped it in my CD-rom, and I must say, for the first few songs, except for Patricks voice, I was wondering who took my Fall Out Boy and replaced it with this crud? The lyrics are like a bad avril lavigne song, with trite lyrics like ""you are my canary, I'm a coal mine."" I get to the second song, and feel like i've been transported to a Red Hot Chili Peppers song. Each song sounds like every onther one on the CS (and I swear, this is from a person who really loves FOB) I'm willing stay optimistic and hope when I play them a few times, I can come to enjoy a few songs, although the next single is quite transpartent. Listen to the CD and see if you can pick it out.Oh, and the into by Jay-Z was extremly cheesy, and made me cringe. They should have stuck with a sound effect."
4,Oh Fall Out Boy...,"I have loved this band since the first day I found them. Although this CD is a lot more pop than I could ever hope for out of FOB, I still can't help but love it; I love the lyrics. I just hope there isn't even MORE pop in the next CD.."
2,"They've sold out, gone mainstream, lost their sound","Take This To Your Grave was amazing. I still listen to that disc from start to finish, nearly once a week. From Under The Cork Tree began the pop, girly, emo, and lets face it, annoying trend that all bands begin when they get their hands on the almighty dollar. This album...I'm ashamed to say that I even know their name anymore. They've lost touch with everything that got them started in music.Oh yes, it will make money, it will be on charts, people will love it. You'll all rip it to mp3, or download it, then add it to your white colored evil (othewise known as ipods). This is what we call ""trendy."" Enjoy being clones."
3,"Fall Out Boy leaves us with a few good tunes, and a few not so good tunes","Fall Out Boy's much anticipated release, Infinity on High, is a very good cd but does not live up to the expectations of what everyone thought it would be. track 5 and track 7 are very good, but some songs, like the 1st song are just confusing. It's like mixing pop punk emo with a death metal guitar rhythm. It's just not the greatest song ever. Although I would recommend the purchase of this record I would not recommend listening to it everyday because you might not like it after listening to it to much. But if you live in the fourth quandrant chances are, you'll fall in love with fall out boy's new cd. that is why I moved to kentucky."
1,"If you like Pop music, you might like this.","It seems that other than a song or two, Fall Out Boy forgot their guitar's. Very disappointing and slow paced."
1,List it right,We did a search on Amazon for book book music for the listed band and this was offered which also made mention of note music. Turns out it was a CD from the band and not a guitar book as we assumed. Not sure if it was an intentional fake out or accidental but it was a waste of time for me.
2,FOB lost the formula for growing older,Folks - you listen to this disk and then fire up From Under The Cork Tree - and this is crap. Honest. Any song from the last album SMOKES everthing on this disk. What a total letdown. These guys went from one of my favorite bands to one that I can't listen to anymore - I mean - this is absolute crap. I have listened to this new disk about 6-7 times and the magic from Under The Cork Tree is spent. Do yourslef a favor and don't buy this crap.
1,not music nothing nada and not even nada surf move along now people,"the most overhyped album of the century next to chumbawumba and the titanic soundtrack. no creativity here and the music just plain is horrible, nonsense takes on a new meaning with these posers. Almost as bad as system of a down but dummer than justin timberlake. do not waste your money and if you want talent look elsewhere. hard to believe people even buy this junk."
2,WTF...,".. happened to these guys? Lost their angst, their grit, their punk. Overproduced and f*cking boring. I'm glad I listened to the tracks before I bought the album.If you like mainstream drivel, this album is for you."
2,2 Stars Because At Least It's Not Rap,"I picked up the new Fall Out Boy album today with pretty high hopes that they might go back towards their sound from Take This To Your Grave. From Under the Cork Tree wasn't for me, and Infity On High is more of that trash only even more overproduced. I don't know that I've ever actually listened to a CD and thought: ""Wow, they really ruined this with a bunch of overproduction."" Well, now I have. Infinity On High is not fun to listen to, and that's what I liked about Take This To Your Grave. On this new release Patrick sounds like he's trying really hard to sound like that guy from Maroon 5. Maroon 5 is bad enough, but when someone is trying to sound like them it makes me want to kill myself. Also, Andy's drums are nothing more than mediocre on this album (when they were pretty incredible on Take This To Your Grave).Anyway, if you're a Fall Out Boy fan you might like their new sound, but it's not for me. I give it two stars because at least it's a rock record."
4,Sweet Album!!!,"I have to admit that I am not a fall out boy fan but I love this album! I love everything from the lyrics to the amazing beats. They are a very interesting group and a very unique one as well! My favoite songs are thriller; this aint scene, its an arm race; thanks for the memories; golden and the carpal tunnel of the love. I am going to keep listening and I think it is going to get better and better!"
4,Enjoyable pop-punk or emo or whatever you want to call it,"You can argue all day about exactly what ""subset"" of rock music any relatively new group falls under. I am judging this CD (and others, such as the latest My Chemical Romance) by whether I enjoy it or not. Now I have to say, I am clearly not in the target audience of this group (37 year-old settled down guy). However, I find FOB's lyrics reasonably witty and humorous, although maybe sometimes a little too self-aware (although they seem very self-aware about being overly self-aware...does that equate their lyrics to irony???) Regardless, along with the lyrics I find their music to be very catchy, with good guitar riffs and vocal harmonies and generally memorable melodies. I like this new CD in that it has a lot of what was good about the last one (rocking, catchy tunes) but also contains some experimentation (in the form of some funkified sections of the songs) to mix things up. Recommended if you like good songs regardless of the ""genre."""
2,What happened to FOB,"First time I heard this album, I was like, ""This is pretty good, I like it.""Then, from the recommendation of my friends I listened to FOB's first full length album Take This To Your Grave. There is no comparing the two, the first is so much better. If you like this album, you should listen to their better and less popular album Take This To Your Grave.Other than that, this album tends to be way better than most of the mainstream junk out there.Recommendations (Not in order from best to worst):1) Carpal Tunnels of Love2)Do You Know Who I Think I Am?3)Thks Fr th Mmrs4)Fame<Infamyand...Listen to Take This To Your GraveOther than that...LOL ZOMG I LIKE FOOD!!!111onetwo!111!11eleventy!1"
1,Infinity On High,"i was realllly upset to realize how sucky this cd was. i used to love FOB and i'll always listen to their old stuff, but this is TO much. i hate how much their music changed and now the only ppl it appeals to is little teeniebopping fan girls. ewwwww. maybe if they come back with something that sounds a little along the lines of take this to ur grave or from under the corktree i'll listen again. i mean i can understand that they want to change their sound but jesus this sucks!"
2,Fall Out Boy - Infinity On High,"I'll make this short; Take This To Your Grave (2003) is without a doubt a classic record. I still listen to it 4 years later, and I can safely say that Fall Out Boy are responsible for the recent surge in pop-punk/melodichxc because of that record. From Under The Cork Tree (2005) was mildly entertaining, but streamlined none the less. Infintity On High is also (very) mildly entertaining for the first few listens, but shortly after, it grows very tiresome. They've sold out, no two ways around it, and it shows in their music. If you're looking for authentic pop-punk like FOB used to do it, check out The Track Record or Hit The Lights."
1,not for performance,doesn't work with high performance coils! don't order if this is your application. Beautiful design but just doesn't work with many applications. Due to steel braiding you must ground the wires. Not for an easy install.
5,No politics here.,"It was very refreshing to read a book with actual facts and figures, rather than one on someones opinion on how they (or their party) would do things. That said, it is surprising more people haven't taken notice to the amount of propaganda our government spreads, and with our taxes. While Fraser gives many examples of past activites he also cites some current ones, leaves you wanting to know what/who is influencing my opinions without trying to do just that himself."
1,Boring,"1- I'm sorry but i found it to be a very boring book.2- The author's opinion is not consistent with the title, which is somehow deceiving to sell."
1,not good at all,With weak lyrics poor guitar and to much attempt to emulate other artists in a sad attempt to attach himself to annyone who would listen to his horrible cries into a microphone. Triggs is simply not made for a modern audiance with any form of taste.
4,"These are 2 great, original songs","I recently discovered Trini, and heard ""Horse to Mexico"" before I heard ""Straight Tequila."" These are 2 great songs with clever lyrics and Trini's voice is just fabulous. Like everyone else here, I am anxiously awaiting a full CD. Let's hope he is around for a VERY long time!"
4,I can't believe I can't buy a CD of this guy!,This guy has a great voice and stage presence.What is the deal with him not having a CD out that people can buy? I'm ready to buy a copy of every CD this guy records.Get with it people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I love it but I can't find it in the stores antwhere.,I never heard on Trini until the rodeo came to Austin and I loved the song Straight Tequila the first time I heard it. I went to buy the cd and no one seems to have it in stock. The song has a beat that can change your mood from bad to good in seconds. I would definately give it 2 thumbs up.
3,Good Job!,This is a great song! I was flipping channels one day and I was surprised to see a black man singing this twangy country and sounded just as good as Garth Brooks. In a world full of Black singers who are conditioned to sing only R&b and black pop music here is a welcome change! Not since Charlie Pride has a black man embraced country so well! (Eventhough Im an african american who generally prefers r&b music I think ill get out my cowboy boots and dance! )
5,Stargate Atlantis DVD's Fantastic!,I loved the speed in which I got my DVD's. Thank you very much.Debby
4,Second Season Starts To Show Some Character Development,While the first season obviously felt a little weak the second season starts to strengthen the series somewhat as we get to see more character development both in their personality as well as chemistry with the other cast members. The season grows somewhat in entertainment as you get a few new characters to replace leaving ones or replaced ones which thankfully happened early in the series as you didn't get to in tuned with most of the characters just yet to upset you to much with their leaving or replacing. The series still has room to grow and is starting to show it as you become more entrenched in the episodes and waiting for the next one to see what happens next. The prices for these sets is a real bargain and if you already have the complete set of Stargate Sg1 I say it's also time to add the series of Stargate Atlantis next to it on your shelf...
4,welll,"another great season, so whos the reason because the spanish lenguaje its not include? only french!, here in latin america a lot of people see star gate on fox and universal channel."
4,Not as good as season 1,"I really liked season one. This one, I felt was not quite as good. Considering the battle at the end of season one, I though it was bit of a cope out the way, they saved Atlantis."
1,Where did mophead come from,"I seriously have to wonder whether anyone at Sci-Fi ever watched this series. Where did Ronin come from ? Why didn't they just buy a two dollar rag mop and stick it on his head, it would look no less ridiculous.... I sure hope this show gets better, 'cause it is painful to watch now..."
5,Outstanding!,"This boxed set is compact, yet colorful and I don't have to tell you the content is GREAT! This season is really outstanding!"
4,"Stargate: Atlantis, the Complete Second Season",Good to go. I could watch this over and over. I'm waiting for season 3 to be released.
5,series,Good series. Stargate Universe has been cancelled before I have written this review but I hope it continues in one form or another.
5,Great series. More fun the second time around.,Great Sci Fi adventure series. I enjoy watching this run the 2nd time around and catching all of the story development.
4,Good Carry Over,"I believe Atlantis came into existence at the right time. SG1 had done it's job at laying the ground work, for a different story line. Atlantis often is weaved into SG1 and vice versa, which in essence creates one big Stargate show. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys witty drama, interesting plot twists, and the realm of science fiction."
2,"Cleavage, Wonder bra's work wonders !!!!!","All the years Iwatched SG1 I never saw cleavage on Carter, wonderbra? Push them up and squeeze them together, voila - cleavage...... I seriously hope the writers kill off the Rodney character, what a loser..... Rock on Carter, wear them wonder bras......"
4,Greatest show ever!,Nothing is perfect. I dislike it was canceled. Everyone watch this great show. Its great. Really great just not 4 star great.
5,Great Show,the adventures continue after Stargate SG1 left off. I like the concepts the writers came up with for a network of gates that cut the travel time to planets light years away.
5,One of the best sci-fi series ever!,"I grew up watching Star Trek (as in the original series) and have always enjoyed sci-fi. I have to admit that this series is one of the best, past or present. The plots are well-written, the characters have a depth not usually found, the writing, (particularly the exchanges between Rodney and anyone)is first-rate and there are plenty of silly moments - enough to keep even my 7-year-old and 14-year-old entertained. Additionally, there are almost no moments I would feel I had to skip or fast-forward through because I would consider them inappropriate for my kids. I would highly recommend this series to any sci-fi fan."
3,Keeping up the good stuff,"I started watching Stargate Atlantis during the strike and I guess I got into it! But: The episodes are so ""stand-alone"", except the storyline about the wraith it's not alot going on to keep you from missing an episode.Also wish for more about the relationship between the characters, not much PG13-action... But as I said, good entertainment!"
3,Very good,"This is an excellent product on Amazon, I will try to get some others seasons, it is a great chance to start colect them all."
2,For die-hard fans only.,"The recording quality of this ""official bootleg"" leaves a lot to be desired, but the true value of the CD is being able to listen to the original version of ""Raw Meat"" before it was watered down and massacred for the studio album ""Suits"". Other than that, the only other real purchase value is the topless photograph of Fish backstage, looking like he's just come off the operating table for breast enlargement surgery. Not for the weak of stomach. For die-hard fans only."
5,A touching new look at a timeless tale,"I must say that I was so surprised at how touched I was this new look at a timeless tale. The life of Jesus as seen through the eyes of Luke the physician was gripping, very well done, inspiring! It had a great balance imagination that was based in the very words of the Gospel. I cried and was encouraged and I think that many other people from all walks of life, will enjoy it. Adult and childred alike."
5,Uplifting and Motivating,"Reading Everyday Miracles has left me feeling uplifted and motivated to deal with some unsatisfying areas of my life. This book has empowered me. It has given me the tools I need. Dr. Nelson's no-nonsense approach makes facing the problems in my life seem doable, not such a daunting task. I am grateful I read Everyday Miracles. It was just what I needed!"
2,I'm 11 I know this kind of stuff,I'm 11 year old gamer and moviegoer. Now I think the Movie was OK not a World Wonder though. I was saving money up for this game. When I got it I played constantly but at level to out of 4 I got really bored you will too! Please don't buy this its confusing for kids and adults should be sleeping through it.
2,Not a good game!,"I loved the movie, The Grinch, but this game is just bad.First of all, the graphics are very bad for Dreamcast. They look more like Playstation's graphics. Second, It gets annoying. Every few steps, you will have to wait a minute while they recite a cute little DR. Seuss rhyme about the place. Third, the missions you have to do are very poorely explained. Fourth, one of the most annoying things were that every time you go near a kid in Whoville, he'll try to hug you and say,""Hi big daddy!"" and you have to shake him loose. This happens a lot.I have to admit that they did do a good job on Whoville."
1,BLINK - AUDIO - ARRIVED IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE !!!!,this audio arrived in Spanish and is of no use to me. a waste of my money. i opened it - put it in my cd player - and it is illegible.
4,Spirt of the Heart,Overall I think the words and music are very well done. Would enjoy hearing other music by this artist.
3,Not a literal translation,"I had hoped the book would be a literal translation (or transliteration) from the Hebrew, but it is not--- for one example, it still says ""god"" instead of ""power males"" for the Hebrew ""el-ohim."" It is a dissapointment."
5,Combination Wrench Set,Excellent product for the right price.Crescent FRR4 4 Piece 3/8-Inch to 9/16-Inch 72 Tooth Reversible Ratcheting Combination Wrench Set
4,new tryouts,borland c programming starter kit deluxe 5.0 is a good deal andi would recommend it if someone were to ask.
5,The Great Moa,"Wow, she truly was the deadly china doll. Love all her films she has been in. In the 1970's you had too actress' that were action film stars, Pam Grier and Angela Mao; in the 2000's we have none. Too bad they have no assertive female heros in action films like her. My, how time has gone backwards."
1,Counterfeit,"I have been using this product for over 15 years and this product is not the real thing,I have left over samples and Lagerfeld from Kmart and this is not the real thing as it lasts less than 5min."
4,Urban Hero,I saw Mirageman at the Seattle International Film Festival two years ago. This is a great little film with no special effects but a great story. Very entertaining for the over 13 crowd. Anyone wanting to see how a man could become a masked hero in the real world will find this very instructional. It plays things very realistically in the beginning.
5,Great Christian Music!,"I love Nikki Leonti's new CD! Its great to hear powerful Christian lyrics w/ up-beat music that i love. The beat isn't overpowering and doesn't drown out the message she is relating to her listeners. I recommend it 100%! Hey, if you like this music as much as i do, email me @ avalon79@hotmail.com!"
5,A required addition to the library of all philosophers,"Pythagoras is arguably the father of western culture. Certainly his theories have had a profound effect on the development of mathematics, music, architecture, the visual arts, philosophy, qabalah, astrology, astronomy, and the list goes on. Much as today's fans of Plato refer to Aristotle as a mere shadow of the former great man, so too can fans of Pythagoras say the same of Plato. Pythagoras was the first man to call himself a philosopher -- a lover of wisdom.This book contains translations of all of Pythagoras' extant work, as well as many short essays by his contemporaries and students. There are many diagrams and charts which serve to effectively clarify his ideas. Overall, this book is a must have for any who seek truth."
4,Good Information,This book is a good resource and has lots of striking statistics on what is going on in modern nurse community relationship. Reading a little dry but quite worthwhile.Some important information on patient care given in here.
2,Disappointed for the first time,"I was profoundly disappointed with this book. It was not well written, but more importantly, the editing was extremely deficient. Mis-spelled words, missing letters in other words, each paragraph set off from the one above by one or two lines. Missing sentences and paragraphs. I continued to read it because I live in the upstate of South Carolina, close enough to the location of the book to have an interest in the background of the news stories I had read. I will look carefully from now on and will not choose another kindle book from this author or this publisher."
2,Errors To Distracting,"I thought maybe the settings on my Kindle were not set right, so I went back and read the one and two star reviews & realized it was editing errors. Words were separated in the middle, missing words and unfinished sentences. I finished reading the book, but knew the outcome before, because the trial results were revealed in the middle with pictures and trial results. I will be on the look out for this publisher & editor from now on."
3,An easy read.,"This was a well told story and I read it to the end. However, the characters did not grip me from the beginning nor did I feel a connection with Patricia. But any true crime book is an interesting read."
1,Quality problems,"The book appears to have promise but I became frustrated with the multiple spelling mistakes and also some sentences were started but never finished, instead the book skips to another paragraph. Very sloppy editing - it almost appears that the editor had very poor command of the English language. To finish the book, I intend to buy it in paperback"
2,VickiS622@aol.com,I was rather disappointed in this story; didn't feel it held my interest as much as some other true crime stories I have recently read.
3,Interesting,"The story itself is fascinating and holds the reader's attention. You really do want to read the whole book from start to finish. However, the author's style is somewhat disjointed and ""choppy"". This is her first book, and I think that this will improve with more experience. I'm not sure if it would have been as interesting to me if I did not have a connection to the locale of the story."
1,Do *NOT* Buy from Speck Products!,"Bought this for my little nephew's iPod Mini from Speck Products. What I rec'd was for an iPod Nano. Emailed Speck Prod and rec'd an answer telling me I was wrong and that it would fit a Mini (despite the packaging saying it was for a Nano). Wrote back letting them know what the package said and never rec'd an answer. Finally opened package and sure enough, it wouldn't fit a mini. Ofcourse the invoice said that once the package was opened, it could no longer be returned!While the little iGuy was cute and the thick rubber would protect an iPod for a child; the way it opens to charge the iPod (sitting down) would eventually quickly cause the iGuy to break in half. That said, if I could give it no stars for customer service, I would."
4,cute item,Got this for my son who wanted my pink Ipod mini (hand me down) and wanted this to cover up the pink. Some pink still shows but it is a well made cute item for your ipod mini.
2,Not the best,"I disagree with this being hailed as quintessential Mink. I felt that this was a letdown after seeing Walt Mink live. They were thoroughly better than this CD when I saw them. The CD came out no too too long after I had seen them live so the memory was still fresh and not softened by time. I NEVER listen to this, though I do keep it as part of my collection. If you must have Live Mink this is the way to go. If you love them and do not need 'Alternate versions' steer clear.Side note.The label on the CD is misleading. It lists, I beleive, Showers Down then Twinkle and shine. THey advertise this as 2 different songs when in fact it is a medley. It was confusing as the number of tracks are different than the number of tracks that are listed."
1,not as described,"This item is described incorrectly. It has a hook and loop or Velcro closure which is a lot of trouble in the laundry and I was very careful NOT to order that type of closure. I called and was immediately offered a replacement... with the correct closure, but when the replacement arrived... it was the exact same thing with the same horrible closure. Why not just tell me you are sorry for the inaccurate description and accept the return because you don't have what I wanted to order? Then, change the description so no one else has to do all this. I intend to be relentless until the description is changed. If the description were accurate, I would have ordered a different bib. Also, the color is not 'Navy' either. It is medium blue. The color is not important to me (could be to someone else) but I am irritated by the complete inaccuracy."
2,"Confusing, poorly focused look at murder in suburbia.","The author introduces so many characters and so much uesless information that the reader is left to wonder what really happened in Westchester. The Police claimed that Warmus is guilty of murder because she was a spoiled, sexpot....and the author ate it up. How was this ditz able to pull off a professional hit? Why did Paul Solomon lie about where he went the night of the murder? If Carolyn was obsessed with Paul, why was she sleeping with other men at the time? This is a mess of a book that doesn't begin to answer the many questions about this case."
1,Tedious and 'Fictional',"This was one of THE worst true crime books I have ever read. So much tedious USELESS information it made my brain hurt just trying to sift through all of it. It started off pretty good, but the minutiae of information from the detectives on to the trail was so overwhelming I had to quit reading it. And I NEVER stop reading a book. And there is no way the author could have known what everyone was thinking. That makes me believe this is more 'fictional' than true crime. And it's such a shame too. A rich heiress who graduated Columbia University with a masters degree goes on to kill her lover's wife by shooting her more than 8 times! There's no way this could be boring right? Wrong...I would definitely skip this one."
4,One of the better source books,"Brassey's series of books on uniforms and equipment are among the better sources. Covering the U.S. Regulars, Militia, Texas Rangers as well as the Mexican forces, this book is well worth having. True, it focuses on the U.S. troops, but this is because there is quite a bit of information, photographs, and exhisting clothing and equipment. The Mexican troops are a bit harder to research. Most historians have come to rely on Joseph Hefter, who pioneered the effort of documenting Mexico's military history. The color plates by Richard Hook are quite good and give good detail. The photos of reenactors also add to the quality of this book. The only negative comments ? The price is high, but if you want a valuable resource, it comes with a cost.A section devoted to the weapons of both armies and their effectiveness would have been handy. If you are a student of this conflict, go for it."
4,Great quality for the price,"Yes, it's pressboard furniture, but the quality is great. If you're only familiar with the cheesy pressboard microwave and TV stands from years back, you may be reluctant to buy this. But the directions are very clear, it goes together easy (took about 1/2 hour), is sturdy, and doesn't look like pre-fab furniture. They even give you a strap to mount it to the wall so it doesn't tip over (a good idea, since we put our TV on top). Very pleased with the finished product. One note: some of the pieces arrived damaged in shipping, but the manufacturer immediately sent replacements with no hassle or questions asked."
1,COMPLETE PEICE OF CRAP!,We took this out of the box and some of the peices of the cardboard drawers were bent and some were broke! While putting it together the screws didn't even do a thing exept to pivit the position (they didn't hold it in place at all). Needed to add our OWN screws for stability so it could just STAND! Its wobbly and dangerous!If there was a 1/2 star rating that's really what it'd deserve. The only good thing about it is the way it looks once its assembled. Looks more sturdy than it really is. PEICE OF CRAP...not worth even a quarter of the price we paid!
1,i would suggest not to purchase,this dresser is made very cheaply it was falling apart before i could even get it out of the box plus the screws were missing. i am sending it back
1,shocking quality,"The quality of this kindle book is one of the worst ive seen. Pages are duplicated and not all of the pages are using the same text size. It may have been worth a read, but the low quality of the ebook made it very difficult. I wish I could get my money back (I should have looked at the preview a bit closer)"
2,Good product,"This is a roll of bubble wrap which is just fine. The packaging is way too big, about 3 times what is needed. This has an effect on the decision to purchase this as you have to get rid of the waste"
5,Exactly as advertised!,This was a gift for a very special friend and he absolutely loved it. It's been a few days and he hasn't given up popping each bubble yet.
1,Many bubbles were without air,"I expect when I buy bubble wrap for there to be air in the bubbles. In many sheets of this pack, the air was gone and all that was left was the plastic. Kind of a rip-off."
2,good for sleeping,"I'm not complaining ,because I'm a UFO nut. This movie was so bogus but I washed it all except the end by that time I was a sleep. Gave it a 2 star one out of respect for Roger Moore who must have needed the job and like I said I'm a UFO NUT."
5,the best,word can not explain this cd it was the besti mean you will not be dispoint by listen toit i know i will be buy more from michael jackson
5,Why didn't I buy this CD before!!,"I really enjoy this CD. Not trying to tell my age, but I have this on tape and decided to get it on CD. This is a must have."
5,consistently good,"Sure, MJ may be a little strange, but who cares? Whatever he does with his face, clothes, etc. is his damn business. Anyway, this CD kicks. It is more than 70 minutes long and contains a wide range of music: R&B, dance, rap, hard rock, and, of course, a couple of sappy ballads like Heal the World and Gone too soon. The musical arrangements are masterful. All the dance tracks have tons of energy and after almost 9 years it still does not sound dated. I hope his next album will be as good as this."
3,Not the greatest,"This is still a good CD, but not one of my favourites, his music from the Bad album was better, but there are a few good songs on this album, like black and white."
3,Disappointed in product but not in MJ,"I love the CD but I thought since this was supposed to be a special edition it would include special tracks, interviews or unreleased cuts. IT seemed to be the same as the CD I already had. The only thing that was different was the cover (liner notes section) which had some different pictures."
3,Please don't hate me,"I loved Michael Jackson's first three albums. Please do not hate me for giving this three stars. I like Michael Jackson a lot. I think he is an amazing talent even if he looks a little ""Strange"" these days. Anyways, about this album...while it did have a big impact on the radio, mtv and sales it really is pretty subpar compared to his 1st three classics. ""Black Or White"" Had a cool video but even Michael himself said it was a ""Throwaway track"" from ""Bad"" and it even sounds like one. There are some classic songs on here like ""In The Closet"", ""Remember The Time"", ""Will You Be There"" and ""Heal The World"" but this album just doesn't flow as well as his 1st three ones did. I felt like I've heard this before somewhere. If you haven't bought any of Michael Jackson's albums yet get his 1st three because they are his best."
4,"Great album, yeah, but isn't this the SPECIAL edition?","No bonus tracks? Nothing at all? Just pictures? Sorry, but that's not good enough for a ""SPECIAL"" edition. And don't tell me about the ""remastered"" tracks. I really can't tell the difference at all."
5,Calidad Musical es lo que sobra en este cd,"Desde que tengo 5 años, mi principal afición fue la música en general pero sobre todo la de ese hombre que hacia que la musica fuese diferente, me refiero a Michael Jackson. Hoy con 20 años siendo profesor de musica y arreglador puedo decir que es realmente impresionante escuchoar este CD, especialmente los tracks 3, 8, 12 y 14. Los arreglos son excelentes, la orquestación es impresionante y por sobre todo las letras hablan de la dura realidad en la que vivimos hoy en día, la que todos sabemos, pero que muy pocos se animan a decir, estando Michael Jackson entre este grupo de ""Pocos"" que se animan"
5,Michael Jackson - Dangerous CD,One of the best albums Michael Jackson has ever released. A gem! Solid music throughout.
5,Slowly changing his pop music to Pop/Rock music.,"I grew up with this type of music, so this is my fave MJ album. See if Quincy was around for this album it would definitley not be the style of music it is, all of this album is very good, ""Gone Too Soon"" is the weakest track. As I said in My ""BAD"" Review ""Dangrous"" Done something most albums cant do and also done something most albums would/can do. It Sold more than its Predessor ""Bad""!!. But it only got 1 #1 Single, ""Black Or White"" all the rest were very top 40. He sold out tours worldwide, but unfortunatley this would be the last HUGE selling MJ album. in 1993 he got charged with child molestation so this pretty much ruined his career. But this album is a total classic but it definitley deserved more credit than it got. If you should own two MJ albums only, This one ""DANGEROUS"" is defitley one you should have, it is one of his best."
5,This is a must have for any MJ fan,"some ppl say it flopped, some ppl say the scandals overshadowed it..i say this is JAM PACKED with more hits than ur money can buy on any other cd out there,, do urself a favour, instead of spending money on any cd, this is the one thats worth the money. ""who is it"" has a tune that would haunt ur dreams, it's a true classic, other all time greats include ""Remember the time"", ""Jam"", ""In the Closet"", ""black or white"", and the ballad ""heal the world"". i dont know how any music fan can miss out on this one.peace."
5,Wonderful,"Dangerous,wow. This is really a great CD. One could only imagine what this CD was going to do on the charts had not that child molestation levied him. Michael and Teddy were wonderful together. Some of Michaels best dancing. Best lyrics and music was featured on this CD.Another must have. Infact I recommend all of his CD's up to Dangerous."
5,Dangerously Good!,"This album is the best I own, and I own a ton!! Michael is such a crafter of songs, such a magic-maker, and it is never more evident than on this cd. He literally blows away ANYONE who might try to compete. This cd is so diverse, without seeming schizophrenic. He has songs that display a growing ferocity in his music, and then he has songs that just make you want to be his friend more than anything. He is obviously one of the most influential singers of today. Ask any male (and many female) singer who his influences are, and he'll be sure to say Michael Jackson. This is because of such masterfully produced albums as this. And don't think he's finished yet! Michael has a new cd slated for release during the summer. Prepare to be knocked flat on your back one more time..."
5,I HEART HIM MJ IS THE MAN,top 5 dangerous picks:Who Is ItGive In To MeWill You Be ThereHeal the WorldJam
2,No new tracks,"Folks--avoid this. The first album sounded fine and this is just an attempt to cash in on the new ""remaster"" phenomenon. Madonna, Pet Shop Boys and Blondie have all just reissued part or all of their catalogs as rematsters-but here's the up side for them. The albums NEEDED to be rematstered and include bonus tracks. In the case of Blondie, the albums weren't even available anymore. Dangerous is readily available and was recorded using state of the art technology. The original sounds fine. This edition continas no new tracks, no interviews, nothing extra. THe other three (Off The Wall, Thriller and Bad) at least have extra tracks, and the first two were probably in need of some serious remastering. Dangerous should just sit on the shelf."
2,King of Pop???,"I'm not sure what Michael Jackson does to continue earning the title ""King of Pop."" Let's face it, he hasn't released a groundbreaking record since Thriller and doesn't record or perform with the kind or proficiency or frequency to earn such a high status. It seems that he makes more headlines for his actions off the stage or out of the studio. All that aside, Dangerous does little else than provide us with a few moments of tuneful hooks. The lyrics are as naive and played out as the music is tame and lacking in the adventure and spirit that characterized Jackson's earlier work."
2,Souless Excess,"The problems that surfaced on Bad are exacerbated on Dangerous: 1) To continue to outdo himself in product sales and hype; 2) competition with sister Janet leads to a less organic and more percussive sound; 3) insistence on most songs to try to emulate the Jimmy Jam 80's production. While it worked with the Time and was popular with Janet, it doesn't fit Michael Jackson's vocal talents; 4) probably as a result of 2 and 3 the songs are far less melodic, the production monotonous and uninteresting as Quincy Jones is sorely missed. I would have given the album ONE star, but for the fabulous ""Remember the Time"" with tight vocal harmony overdubs by MJ. If this is your first Michael Jackson do yourself a favor and get ""Off the Wall."""
2,MJ sucks,"I was a huge fan of MJ when I was in college but gone are those real immature days. MJ was good in Off the wall, Thriller and Bad was definitely good but Dangerous was a huge disappointment. Only a few songs in the middle order are a pleasure to listen to otherwise in the closet, jam, why you wanna trip on me and the others are a bogus list. Will you be there stands out of the album. Black or white, Who is it, Give in to me are exceptional songs. Dont buy this album save your money. A rather discouraging effort by MJ. Sure is"
5,Michael Jackson Dangerous,Michael J. Jackson keeps it right where it belongs. The number one artist. By this time he is in a big Jam and you can tell by listening to the anger in this album. He is beeing critisized by the way he is. And he expresses it clearly threw the music on this hit. Truley a very touching album of all times. The music on this makes you want to cry and then it makes you want to burn the place alive. (dance) So if you do not have this you must get it. Micahel is the King Of Pop. I have been a fan ever sence I was little. still am.
5,Dangerous,"This album is simply amazing. I think that it is probably Michael's best work. There are so many amazing tracks. My favourites are Remember the Time and Dangerous. The only songs that I don't like are Gone Too Soon and Heal The World which is lank overrated. Will You Be There is one of his best ballads. I have all of Michael's albums and am waiting for his new album, Invincible. I expect it to be very good because his new song is phat. Buy this album."
2,"Oh, no...","Oh, no... What a terrible album from Jackson! He put 11 fillers beside Black or White, Give In 2 Me and Heal the World, the only 3 real songs on this album. Remember the Time was a bit worse but listenable, but all the other songs R on this album R even worse than the opening track, Jam.... Get a Jackson Best Of instead, containing those three hits, that R really good. Give in 2 Me is the song that just doesn't fit into this album's weakness, it should be appeared on a better one in the future."
3,Good,"This is a good album but michael tried to much to be like Thriller instead of just making a good album. Although ""Black Or White"" was a really good song and ""Remember The Time"" was good the rest of the album is just filler and sounds better on video than on the album. The album debuted at number 1 but only stayed there for 4 weeks and showed Michael jackson could be losing it. This album is okayt but I wouldn't buy it."
1,artwork,i am a die hard michael jackson fan and i love this Cd but the back of the booklet and the front has a DOG AS JESUES WHY IS THIS ON THERE HOW RUDE
4,Good Overall Review of Sports Medicine,This text provides a good review of sports medicine and rehabilitation of common injuries for the medical professional. Very readable--a good start for those interested in musculoskeletal medicine and athletics. The chapters are well organized and well-referenced. I think this is one of the better sports medicine books available.
3,Finally i got the memory card,A little late of what I wait but finally I received the memory card. It is in great conditions and work good. Thanks
2,Can;t wait for the rest,"This season was when the show started to get..... alright... it's almost in the leagues of ""hang Time""... the show came into it's own when Ryan came to the show and then his step brother Nicky.... Ryan was short and dated a tall chick named Rachael... that is the new class that I can't wait for!!!! in this season there are less, well, screech, zach and slater characters.... except for well screech!!! Honestly I wish that they would release ""california Dreams"" on DVD... that would rule... I miss watchin Sly!!!"
5,This approach is the best I've experienced,I received a copy of this book in conjunction with a large change management effort in our company. The approach is by far the most engaging and impactful recipe for building results I have seen in my 19 years in business. This book challenged my thinking and inspired me. (I am amused by comments made by other reviewers).This is not another feel good corporate astrology book. It dives into the heart of how to manage success.
5,Made such a difference in my business,"I got this book at the recommendation of my brother-in-law. He reads alot of management books, and said this was really worth the time. I read it from cover to cover and decided to use it where I work, both with my staff and with my boss (who had been difficult for me). That was 2 months ago, and the differences have been remarkable. I used the approach outlined in the book, which was very detailed and easy to follow. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their results---it's no-nonsense and eye-opening."
1,"Interesting ideas, horrible in practice","Howard Goldman was hired into our company facilitate the merger of a online retailer and a cosmetics company. I feel Howard's theories and consulting eventually led to the downfall of our company. His theory and consulting caused feuding, distrust, and dissention within our company and the partner, I would advise anyone who is thinking of using Howard's theories or services to keep searching."
3,Some nice romantic bachatas,"The material doesn't have the depth of their previous, We Broke the Rules; and the self-promotion in the intro and elsewhere is a bit tiresome. Still, some nice bachata rhythms and vocals here such as in the standout song for me, Deja Vu, Hermanita, and others. It's worth buying if you like their style."
4,New bachata lover,"well, i never was one to enjoy the bachata style, but after these guys came out and modernized it to this extent, im hooked from now on, i guess all types of music go through a phaze where someone comes and changes the norm, but aventura did it for all the youth who grew up listening to latin music, the same as mark anthony did it for salsa, these young men from the bronx have made bachata the sound of the spanish youth. buy this cd, its worth every penny."
1,cheap POS,"arrived damaged. listed as all metal construction when i purchased (shocker after i complained they changed it) when it is really a cheap piece of plastic. this is meant for cheap airsoft rifles or props, not actual paintball of airsoft guns. it arrived damaged and missing parts. i contacted the seller, they ask for pictures (they didn't believe me even after i sent pictures), finally convinced them to give me a refund but i had to pay to ship it back. WTF? its your fault it arrived damaged. horrible product and horrible seller"
3,Dont work for A-5,"I purchase this product for my tippmann A-5 and dint work, look very nice in a 98 custum tippmann and looks very cool! I got 4 of thisThaddeus PorrasPanama Rep. of Panama"
2,Digital Restoration ?????,"This 1995 reissue of a classic Pointer Sisters CD is a perfect example of how not to remaster music. It sounds flat and empty. My advice is to pick up a vinyl copy instead, until someone at BMG gets their act together and remasters all the Pointer's Planet material at today's standards. It can't be that hard - just listen to some of the Hip-O-Select reissues of even earlier Pointer material - fantasic full rich sound, that you'd think was recorded today using the best facilities. This CD is a major disappointment."
4,The Great Game Ct'd,"A nice followup read to ""The Great Game"" (also by Hopkirk), this book details the efforts between the World Wars by the Soviet Union to spread Marxism to the east. Like The Great Game, there are dashing adventurers, wily spies, lunatics, and odd characters aplenty. There are some great individual stories, such as the British agent who the Soviets hired to find himself, and several crackpots with serious delusions of grandeur. What really emerges is how tenuous Moscow's hold was on its further-flung regions, as Bolsheviks, White Russians, and native people vied for control of these regions. Ultimately, the books is less cohesive and thus less satisfying than ""The Great Game"" (and about half the size!)."
4,Good for the price,"Reasonable quality, good steel. Edge doesn't hold terribly well, and grip is a rubberized one that is a bit tacky to the touch. Scabbard is okay. Good quality for the price...but you pay for what you get in swords."
2,Red Master Chinese Tai Chi Practice Sword,The blade is so stiff that it has bent slightly just in front of the handle from from My Tai Chi and Kung Fu practice. I would not recommend this blade except as a decoration piece.
1,not too pleased...,alright so lets start withg the good. shipping was very fast came in a day early. packaging looked good. sword blade was shiney. careful with the tip kinda sharp. alright the bad. the handle was really loose. the balance was off alot. the blade droops. the paint job on the sword handle and sheath was poorly done. and the sheath was cracked all the way down the side. the blade stays in the sheath but it also rattles inside the sheath. so that bothered me a lil bit
1,NOT Paul Chen Sword,"At first glance this looks exactly like the Spring Steel Practical Wushu Tai Chi Jian sword. However, the REAL sword that this is a copy of costs 95.00 for a reason. It is less than one pound which is a must for wushu practitioners. This sword is 4 pounds which is absolutely ridiculous even for a full tang katana. The REAL one is made of wushu spring steel which is necessary in order to have an audible ""water song"". Don't be fooled into thinking this is the ""as seen elsewhere for 100.00"" Tai Chi Jian, it is NOT. When I first saw this sword it nearly made me ill to think I paid 300% more...until I read further. Other than being an unheard of 4 pounds, this may not be that bad of a sword. I'm only writting this review to correct wrong assumptions."
3,Not that moaning!,"Although I had never heard of Tony D, I decided to give it a go. I expected to hear some moaning beats - after all Tony D declares to be the master of those. But instead I heard some pretty catchy and funky beats. for the great part the tracks on this album are instrumental, but there's vocal on a few of them. The rap is OK - performed by the Outsidaz - not swell.Still I think it is a great album to listen to if you are not really listening. Say, you're at a party and this CD is rotating in the background - not really sumfin you wanna dance to ( except for track 04 ) but still you really enjoy it!!!This CD is a mixture of a good couch and a Spanish guitar - o' sumfin!! Catch it if there are no other CDs on your shopping list at the moment!!!!"
3,Last Edition 1993 ! Old and outdated,"This book was last edited in 1993. If you know anything about Supply Chain, you know that technology and management in this area has progressed light years in the last 12 years.There are scores of newer and better books available. It was probably a good book in its day, but today it is so outdated, I would not pay more than $2 for it.Be advised and look elsewhere."
4,SOME GREATE BALLADS,MAANAM IS ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING AND TALENTED POLISH BANDS IN THE 80'S ALSO THEY HAVE APPAIRED ON MTV WITH A BEAUTIFUL AND DARK SONG SIE SCIEMNIA..ON THIS CD YOU WILL FIND SOME OF THEIR BIGGEST HITS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED BELIVE ME ..
5,"So you say a good man is hard to find, huh","Well if you think a good man is hard to find, Look again.. I see 3 beautiful men that are creating beautiful music with no barriers. I love the cut ""This is for the times"" it looked out for the brothers because it made it easier for me to relate to my girl, because sometimes we as men do some foul stuff, but it's good when a man can admit that to himself, then express it to his girl. Man Among Men i hope you keep the good work up and i look forward to chapter 2.."
3,Creative Interiors Bookcase Headboard,"This headboard is OK, but not what I was expecting. It is pine particle board (like Sauder) -- not wood. It is also impossible to find the captain's bed that matches it. When I finally contacted the company, I was told to purchase one of their captain's beds that would be compatible. Well ... bought that bed as well and it is not compatible -- the finish is, but they do not fit together correctly.It's not a terrible headboard -- it seems very sturdy, but it has been a waste of money on my part."
3,WARNING,"This headboard is very nice, lovely actually. Unfortunately in my case it did not work with the rails I had and Target did not sell the mates bed that was recommended for it. I'm going to have to see if the company itself will sell me the mates bed or if I have to track it down by stores. If you do have the proper rails, this is actually a very nice piece, it also seems sturdy."
3,"Fine, but not what I expected","The description of this item is NOT correct. After searching everywhere, I bought this headboard in particular because I was looking for something under 32 inches to fit by a slanted ceiling. This headboard is actually 50 inches high, not 28 like it states. Also it is described as pine finish, I believe wrongly so. It is particle board, like Sauder Furniture, which is fine if that is what you expect. It was easy to put together, and is a nice color."
2,Nice but frustrating,"My son has had this headboard for several years now. It's very frustrating because there is a huge opening between the headboard and his bed, just below the shelves. The picture doesn't show the opening, but it's there. Items like toys that he stores on the headboard and some books keep falling in between the headboard and bed. We even got rid of the captains bed that went with it, (it didn't even connect to the headboard, flawed design) and bought a regular frame to connect to the headboard to see if that would help. It didn't. I'm now looking for a regular panel headboard for my son's room. This headboard would be fine for older (teenage) kids but not for my 11 year old."
3,A decent offering from Blue Room label...,"At the price the import is going for, I wouldn't pay that much for what you get. I got a hold of the domestic one which was selling for about 5 bucks so at least I got my money's worth. Anyway, on to the music:The first two tracks are trippy spaced out techno vibes for your headphones, very nice. If only the CD would continue in this vibe, for unfortunately the rest of the CD cannot match up to these tracks, settling into some rather boring blippy techno in the middle and some sleepy ambient at the end. Although the ambient part isn't too bad, I'd rather be listening to say the Orb or the like. So, the three stars are solely for the first two tracks, since the rest of the CD didn't hold up my interest for long. This CD reminds me of X-Dream's Radio a bit, since that one had a few killer tracks and the rest of it was a bit bland."
3,"A good companion read to ""God's Word to Women"" by Katharine Bushnell","This book adds the detail you want to know about amazing thinker and devout social and Christian worker Katharine Bushnell. This book put ""God's Word to Women"" in perspective. It has history of her life in many facets and covers Bushnells research into the equality of women. I recommend this book if you are interested to find out more about the enlightened Katharine Bushnell."
4,Excellent tool on your path to understanding - with one small problem,"When I decided to break off the relationship with my partner, it was truly the most difficult decision of my life - emotional, heartbreaking, and gut-wrenching. The worst part was feeling the guilt of knowing I had shattered someone else's heart. This book was an excellent way to begin the journey to healing for myself, through understanding what I need to do to prepare myself for the road ahead -- whether alone or coupled. My only disappointment is that while this book did mention that it was targeted equally to couples separating, regardless of who did the deed, the stories clearly focused on the difficult time of those who had their partners leave them, rather than on those who had difficulty coping with a decision they had made to end their relationship. Overall, however, a fantastic tool for those going through a separation or divorce."
3,Good read +++,The book provides useful insights which inturn helped me in many ways for handling through my separation and divorse. This book provides great guidance for someone going through the tough times.
5,Great Book - Confirmed that I was not crazy!,"This book ultimately saved me. It confirmed that all the pain I felt following the breakdown of my marriage was normal. So many books are written only from a women's point of view, but this deals with you, the reader, as a person. There are plenty of case studies of people in different situation that helped me relate, and the author himself went through a divorce, so he definately understands. The book helped ground me into knowing that what I was going through was because I cared and wasa sensative person. There is no judgement and excellent advice on how to handle (or not to handle) difficult situation. I strongly recommend this book to anyone feeling alone, isolated and pressurized by the affects of a relationship split. It takes you through all the steps of what you may have felt and are going to feel: A great book!!"
2,cool idea but it warped almost immediately,"Maybe I got it too wet or something, but it warped very badly only a day or so after I got it."
3,"OK, but not great",The movie is disappointing and disconnected. I had not read the book - so I had no preconceptions though the premise is obviously a bit outlandlish - Boy from Archangel indeed. There are too many jumps and improbable situations. Craig is pretty good throughout with just a touch of James Bond - but the tension is never sustained and scarcey built at any point. It does provide a modern day parallel to Stalin as a murderous sociopath - though again it is fleeting and confusing.
3,Its okay,Didn't quite like it but watched as I had the dvd. It was okay to watch nothing spectacular. Dialogue hard to understand. I will need to watch it again.
5,"Great filming, great acting, fascinating story.","This film took me back to Russia. The scenery and characters played true to life. The ugly rows upon rows of apartments, the village homes, the Moscow winter slush, and the beautiful white Russian snow, which seems to hide everything that is wrong and ugly.I fell in love with Yekaterina Rednikova. She reminded me of some of the wonderful interpreters I had on my many trips to Moscow and the interior. Daniel Craig was lifelike. Just like you or me. (No Schwarzenegger, Pierce Brosnan, or Bruce Willis here). Gabriel Macht was an irritant. A necessary fool.The story, based on the book by Robert Harris, played up to the world's fascination with Stalin, Hitler and the like. Okay, but not as good as Snow Wolf by Glenn Meade. The movie played up to my fascination with Russia and its people. I was not disappointed."
4,Great action movie.,"Archangel is a well written and finely acted action thriller. A lot like a ""National Treasure"" for adults. Fast paced and with enough real history to make it interesting. With all the plot twists fitted together making it easy to enjoy."
3,Russia post-communist: going on world screen,"A film of a brave American professor discovering dark ages of the Soviet history of the Stalin USSR to further dismantle dangers of communism.Also his actions and Russia surrounding hardly convince in both drama and need for these actions leading to known disclosures already.Itself, a work presents a good idea of marketing criminal Russia on international screen."
1,Boring - Boreades,"I think that this CD is really boring, it's music of The Beatles performed in Barroque Instruments, but the music is 99% The Beatles and 1% Barroque. Really boring."
4,a classic 7 seconds release,"This is classic 7 seconds. not as hard as ""Walk together, Rock Together"", but just as great. This is when the band started to get very melodic, but not sappy and preachy. I would greatly recommend this record to all seven seconds fans who have recently discovered the band, and haven't heard their earlier recordings. In my opinion, the best record they ever released...by far."
1,new wind notes,"this is a great album, it really does flow. i think you can tell the songs were written fast, like they discovered this new style and went with it. the last track seems out of place because it was never there, i bought the lp when it came out. they must have stuck it on a re-release. also the original cover was just a picture of steve youth's baby lying on a bed.5 stars"
2,Picture shows 90 degree and straight but it's not,"Although the pictures shows one 90 degree and one straight plug, in fact it is two straight plugs. I guess I should have recongized that from the product title but I figured the picture would be accurate!"
5,A word of caution about objections to this fine work,"There is no better translation available to English language readers than this volume by Vermes. The objections registered by some ill-informed conspiracy-theorists concerning Vermes are themselves based on no real evidence. Vermes has an opinion, a very well-informed scholarly opinion, formed from years of study--honest study. He is not a flaming seeker of fortune and fame as are many people who try to make much more out of what is in the DSS than anyone can possible know. As one trained as a scholar in this area of study, I offer two observations: First, my own word of caution: Beware of DSS conspiracy theories and wild claims made from esoteric so-called readings of the texts. Second, my advice: Read the Scrolls in this fine translation for yourself and ask whether Vermes's ideas are reasonable or whether the wild allegorical re-readings offered by certain flamboyant interpreters have any real merit."
3,The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (Penguin Classics) .,"This, I imagine, would be an excellent refferrence or research point. That said, it is a horrible idea to make this purchase for the sole purpose of reading the Dead Sea Scrolls all the ways through. This book is a direct translation, therefor it contains missing segments and is almost unbareable to try and make any sense of."
3,Excellent but I doubt some translations,"I really enjoyed this book and appreciate having it. Some of the translations are very suspect. It appears that it was translated by Christian scholars who have an agenda. I would not have used many of the same words and would not have made some of the same assumptions.Still, unless there are others that I don't know about, a book worth having."
4,Great stuff,"Deeply felt, beautifully sung music by a very gifted quartet. The sound quality is for the most part quite listenable, although amateurish on some cuts. I only say that because I was burned by the unlistenable sound quality of ""Hallelujah: A Collection of Their Finest Recordings."" The audience reaction on some of the live recordings here is a hoot. There's a sense of humor and lively spirit in this group that's irresistible."
2,Not our favorite,I love to garden and our son is named Jack. I thought this would be the perfect book. He just isn't interested in it. The text is just average and lacks the fun sing song style of other books that are fun to tead aloud. The pictures are interesting and remind me of an old seed catalog. This book rarely gets selected but he likes that it has his name.
3,The binding fell apart!,"I love Henry Cole, and I really like this picture book, but the binding fell apart on the fourth reading."
1,Worst Things ever invinted,"I purchased this for my yorkie-poo because we have hardwood floors. They were fine at first then I noticed she began to lick her feet alot. After a few days I noticed no fur on my dogs feet. Upon further investigation I discovered sores that the plastic had left between her toes. Very ugly blisters and sores. It took my mom, my fiance, and I three hours to remove them from her feet. She yelped and cried the whole time and I cried due to the fact I cannot stand any of my animals in pain. I am furious with this product and will be contacting the company and producing the photos I took of my dogs feet. To anyone looking to buy these stupid things do not they cause your animal pain and it is even more hurtful when you have to remove them!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,soft claws,This seller was great! Quick delivery but the product sucks. My dog cried within minutes of walking around and I only did one paw to see what he would do. he started to try and bite them off and would stand up. I couldn't torture him so I took it off. Wouldn't waste my money on it if your dog is not accustomed to new things.
1,Awful!!!,Item did not work for me at all... Actually made me very sick and nauseous. Glad it works for others but it wasn't the same story for me.
2,"Not a ""set"" but a single bag","I have to review this transaction as a whole and not just on the basis of the product itself. As for the `bag' it looks great and I have no complaints about the product. However this should not be listed as a ""set"" of bags because it is a single pannier. It's very misleading and I'm incredibly irritated, as I really do need a set of panniers for an upcoming tour. Buyer beware...."
2,Predictable,I found this book predictable and the main character not particularly likeable. I can't recommend anyone take time from their life to read this book. It was a sale book so that was good.
4,"Good, clean story","I bought this book because it's a favorite of one of my favorite authors. The story was good, but at times I found it to be slow. This is a good, clean story that doesn't throw in unexpected sex, which is so refreshing for me. I have to say that I did fall in love with ""white dog."""
4,To Dance with the White Dog,A great book to understand aging and losing a partner. Also how children do not always understand aging parents and their needs.
5,Suzelovesbooks,"This was the first book that I have read by this author. When I finished reading it, I downloaded another by Terry Kay. The writing is Southern dialect, and as a Southerner, I found it to be very accurate. The plot was fictitious, but the more you read, the more believable it became. I highly recommend this book, and will reread it myself."
5,to Dance with the White Dog,I loved this charming tale about growing old from the elderly person's perspective. I think it will make me more sensitive to the feelings of my elderly loved ones' feelings. It is light reading and well written. I would read it again and again.
4,A Wonderful Story,"I really enjoyed this book. Terry Kay has a smooth, fresh writing style, and his story of Sam Peek and his White Dog is truly moving. I have just begun Valley of Light and I am already loving this one too. I recommend them both!"
5,jaycee,Excellent insight. Especially for anyone around retirement age or those who have parents at that age. A warm story that made me smile throughout the whole book.
4,Such a tender sweet book,"Kay's ""white dog"" is such a sweet and tender story. It both broke my heart and made me laugh. I had hope, too, and that's always a good thing. Keep storytelling, Mr. Kay and I'll keep reading your fine books."
3,Getting Old Sux,"This is a fun, quick read about getting old. (Alas, a subject on which I am unwilling becoming expert!) Sam Peek befriends a dog invisible to all but himself. Then there are hints that perhaps the dog is the spirit of his departed wife. (I think my wife would brain me, should I conjure her up as a dog, given the unfortunate use of the Middle English form for female dog.)But Sam retains his independence and if his children believe him to be ""rounding the bend"" into senility, that's their problem.Not a book I'll ever read a second time, but I did enjoy the first reading."
2,"Nice story, not well-written","This book tells a sweet story, with an unsurprising ending, but the writing itself is not that great. The story telling is very simple, as if were geared toward elementary school students. Perhaps Mr. Kay should stick to practicing law."
3,To Dance with the White Dog,Since I only paid 1 cent for the book I can't complain. And it came very quickly. But as a read I found it very repetitive and rather boring. It was an old book.
3,Can see a Hallmark movie here!,I enjoyed reading this book and can see it as a Hallmark movie one day. Each time the old man ventured out on his own I feared for his safety even though the white dog was by his side whenever he was alone. That was the intriguing part of this story and the fact that his youngest son was so close to him and so protective. It was worth the read.
5,Thought Provoking,"One of the best books I have read in a long time. In deed it was a story of life well lived, tear jerking loss, and leaving a legacy for our children and grandchildren. Reminded me of Nicholas Sparks. Loved the fact that the story was told without the foul language that is so popular with writers today."
5,Good For Beginners,"This book is very godd for beginners who don't know their rudiments. I have been a drummer for a little over six years and this book really helped me. I am 15 years old and this is the first book that my drum teacher had me use. I teachs you how to roll, how to do ruffs, paradiddles, ratamacues and so on. I really recomend it for kids who are in fifth-seventh grade."
4,"""Buddys"" book..","Lets be clear on this, Buddy did not write a single lession in this book, not to take anyting away from his gift but music notation was not his thing, He signed up for the cash and was given a lump sum for his name and a few pictures...Having said that, the book is fine for learning how to progress with your rudiments."
5,Orbsion T-shirt a hit,I'm very happy with my purchase. This item is hard to find and the price was right. It was well-packaged and arrived promptly.
4,Bang! Flex_ability in my pocket...,I love these little storage devices....I use them constantly to tote info from one pc to another and by doing so I have a built in backup copy...Love it when I go to the Picture printer store to get physical prints of my jpg's. 3 - pack is a bonus....
3,it was ok.,"This is the story of an Australian au pair who works in France. Once she is accepted into the single child family and learns their traits and odd ways, she begins to realise that her family back home aren't that horrible after all.It was an ok book, but l would have been disappointed if l had bought it, instead of borrowed from the library."
4,Teak Bathroom Bench,"We love our new Teak bench for our shower. It was very simple to put together and all the parts were actually there for you. We have been using our bench for about a month now. The only problem there has been with the bench is a small crack in the wood on the top of the seat. I did not notice this crack when putting the bench together, but it's small and you can't really see it unless you are paying close attention. It fits the purpose for which is was purchased. Thanks Amazon."
1,"poor quality, not teak","I bought this ""teak"" stool back in 2009, when the word teak was in the product title. This stool is definitely not made of teak. After only a couple uses in the shower, the varnish (or laminate, or fake finish) started flaking off of the wood. I now have a flaking, crumbling, cheap soft wood stool that I originally thought was teak. I'm glad they changed the product name but I feel completely ripped off. A real teak stool would have lasted for many years."
3,Lots of High Kicks,"There are some very detailed reviews here, and the movie, to me, doesn't merit the time to create another one. I would just like to add this: If you want an action film with lots of women fighters, some excellent male fighters (Naka is very skilled), poor character background or development, this is for you. There is a ton of slow motion replays of nearly every fancy move (which I like but which annoys everyone else I know about the age of 6). I feel that the plot could really have been better, had the characters not been so one dimensional. That said, sometimes a movie is meant to be just like this- lots of action that doesn't bear up to too much deep thought (although there is a substrattum of philosophy from time to time)."
1,high kick girl,"too taikwondoish, and garbage i prefer REAL Karate scenes like Shotokanin REAL Karate circles we call it (Take-My-Dough) as in taikwon do, which really translates toPath of Wrong AssentionPeople are SO Mis-Led these days !"
1,Straight Whack!!!!,"This movie is so bad, (How bad is it?) It's so bad that even though it's free with my Prime account, I could only watch it for 11 minutes and 6 seconds!!!!"
2,Not likely.,"Pretty little girl can beat up as many full grown black belt men as she wants and make them all look bad.Not likely and as every other review say's stop with the slow mo, it just shows to much of the flaws at slow speed. I like the idea of this film and the stunts are pretty cool but this movie just did not work for me. There are better movies with martial arts that are choreographed much better just keep looking."
2,overall disapointing,Overall I was disapointed in this movie the director seems fixated on slow motion replays. I lost count at around 50 of them. In fact some action sequences may have three or four identicle slow motion replays making the once exciting action dull and tiresome. I was also saddened by the main bad guys fight scene and also his number two which both went down like chumps.
2,provokes aversion to reading,"I had it for a class with the most exciting, wonderful, engaging professor a student could dream of. This book was an unbearable drag. This book's format made it nearly impossible to read, impossible to enjoy. I hope the new edition will be revised for (I admit it) ""computer-era"" students who don't know how to read a densely written book with minimalistic print and no illustrations. They still might make excellent psychotherapists (I hope) who shouldn't bypass this rather informative and significant book."
4,GREAT Book,Would not recommend the kindle edition. There are no page numbers and the tables are very difficult to read. Do LOVE the book though. There is a ton of great information regarding mental disorders of childhood.
3,Packed with information,"This book was required for one of my college psychology classes. For those working with children in any kinds of settings, this is a great reference. I give 5 stars for being informative, but only gave 3 stars because I thought it was a little cut and dry. I kept this book for 5 years after I graduated college."
3,Hard to read,"This book is very hard to read. There are citations throughout the text, and the information is not divided into many sections. The text is small, there are no graphics, key words or chapter summaries. Its a lot of valuable infomation, if you can keep your eyes open long enough to read it."
1,This baritone uke is no good at all!,"Believe me, I've had three of them. On all of them the strings started hitting the frets when you play, making a lot of undesirable noise, because the neck had bent backwards after a while,(A couple of months) for some reason. I've now ordered a Ohana baritone uke instead, that I've heard is much better, but more expensive and not as pretty as the Samick Greg Bennett UK70B. But for me it's the quality of playing that counts, not how the instrument looks."
4,Very informative.,This is an excellent book for using native plants in the garden. The only draw back is the lack of useful photographs. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars.
5,Smoldering Blues,This is Clifton Chenier pre-Arhoolie records. It is blues with Lonesome Sundown and Philip Walker on guitars. It is some of the finest swamp blues or any kind of blues there is. The recording quality is fantastic. Great reverby sound. This was done in LA. Clifton ended up leaving LA and heading back to Louisiana but Philip Walker stayed in LA. A lot of this stuff is on the Bayou Blues cd (I'm pretty sure but check for yourself) which is going for a dollar or so on Amazon. Don't let the low price fool ya. This is as good as it gets.
3,It works well enough...,"My primary reason for buying this was to hopefully get rid of a rash near my armpits. This product didn't make the rash worse, but it didn't go away, either. I wound up trying something else that does that job, and works really well to boot.If rash isn't an issue, this works fantastically well. If rash is an issue, you might want to start somewhere else."
3,A good model with questionable paint job,"This Scorponok toy is very well made. It has a lot of details on it and has the same powerful look it has in the cartoon. The toy is reasonably posable as well and the joints are strong, meaning it will be a long time before the joints become so loose that it can't pose anymore. The durability of this toy is very good and it can withstand some tough impact.So why does this toy only get a three out of five star? The toy was given the wrong colors. Ther are no oranges in the original Scorponok and they should be yellow, purple, or light green instead. There aren't any parts with transparent yellow colors in the original design as well. Some repaint on this toy is needed if you want this toy to look like it does in the show."
5,ENERGON SCORPONOK/ wicked.,"Strong, sturdy, original, one of a kind, this is SCORPONOK. Not your typical TRANSFORMER. High attention to detail, the perfect color combination, not a vehicle or a wepon, SCORPONOK is in a league of his own. Imagine that; from scorpion to space ship to robot, all in one! This DECEPTICON is afraid of no-one, includeing MEGATRON. Do you think he will get his revenge on MEGATRON? Maybe so, just don't try to use the energon stinger again(this tends to energize MEGETRON.) Seriously, SCORPONOK is a bad dude. He truely is a wicked TRANSFORMER!"
4,Great now I think I'm crazy,"Very informative book, the author does a great job of keeping your interest in the book. Some books can read like a textbook, but this one covers all aspects of human understanding of how our brain works. This book presents early exploration into the brain and its functions, to current day discoveries and treatments for mental disorders. I am very interested in the subject of treatments or torture for mental disorders of the past, and the author wrote about how some early doctors treated cases of depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. I couldn't help but think of some people I know while I was reading this book, I even think I have a few disorders now, HA, HA, HA, Over all this book is very informative, but if you are looking for depth in one area or topic you may not like this, as it covers a range of topics in about 260 pages."
1,Written in a difficult English,"I am going to be straightforward: the book is written in a slightly overblown language, which is not easy to understand for non-native English speakers. If you are a non-native English speaker, think twice before getting this book."
4,used once,"The book is heavy, shaped like a block. It's a comprehensive guide to buildings in almost each block, three or four sentences for each building. On one hand, I wish it could be more focused, including less buildings but giving more detailed information on them; on the other hand, it makes me appreciate the ordinary city landscapes, rather than just learning about the famous stuff."
4,SEXY Club Song....,Heard this on a wonderful Sunday afternoon dancing and people watching in 'The Cafe' at Castro and Market (SF) and knew I had to have it- its sexy beat make you wanna get it on slowly....DJ blended it in with BenWatt's Sade mix- by your side...what a day...this brings it all back!
4,Ben Watt needs Tracey,A hit from the Lazy Dog double album produced by Ben Watts' long nights of club realities. It shows that he truly needs Tracey in the room to make a hit...any track that lays over her dulcet tones is a must buy....
2,Cute puppy sharks,Boring and repetitive and the sharks were too small to be maneaters.And what was a hot chick doing on a boat with 5 guys?
1,The CD LIES!!!,This is titled 'Disney's Princess Collection' however the second volume has a picture of Mulan. Anyone who has seen Mulan knows that SHE IS NOT A PRINCESS! THIS CD IS FULL OF LIES I TELL YOU!!! LIES!!! I'm very disappointed.
5,My kids love it!,"My girls love anything princess, so when my 5 year old received this for her birthday, she was thrilled. She and her little sister dress up in princess costumes to listen to this cd. I have also enjoyed listening to it."
5,Disney's Princess Collection No. 2,"I really loved this CD. Sometimes I watch the movis from the song just to actually listen to the song. Now with this CD, I only have to put it in my CD player and press play. I really like the songs too. I (very much) recommend this CD."
5,"""Love Songs""","I say love songs because my Granddaughter and I love these songs. She is three and knows all the words. I kid you NOT! Although the ""HOME"" song was not familiar to me, all the others were. (Am I showing my age?) From what I understand, the ""HOME"" is from Broadway. I wish that the producers of the new enhanced Beauty and the Beast movie had thought to include it. I wish that the main theme to Beauty had been on this CD, but maybe it will be on the PRINCESS 2!"
5,Great for the karaoke machine,Our four year old daughter loves to play and sing along with her karaoke machine. This is one of her favorite disks.
1,Poor quality,I had great hopes. But the needle is not set on zero. No way to recalibrate. Not sure if it actually measures properly. Waste of money.
3,"Interesting plot, but often confusing","Many fantasy books are confusing, and then clarify in the end. This one is often confusing, but it seems due to its writing style. OTOH, one definitely cares about the characters, and this says something. There are also several intriguing creatures and places that keep you hooked!My 11 YO and I loved Ms. Downer's ""Hatching Magic"" and ""The Dragon of Never-Was"". So I checked this out of the library. In addition to the sex scenes others have mentioned, there is also rape, incest, and prostitution. My 11 YO won't be getting this book. It is teen/young adult."
4,This is a Sci-Fi book with a New Age twist to it.,I don't usually read Sci-Fi books but I enjoyed this book very much. I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in New Age/Sci-Fi because it has both in it.
2,It lacked a point and filled the gaps with perverted scenes.,This book lacked character development and filled in the gaps with twisted love-making. The author could use tips on writing a better book from a kindergarner. Only perverts enjoyed this book and thoses with no love life.
5,Nevertheless . . . The Foundation of the Lord Stands Sure,"This is an excellent book that gives insight into how to handle the enemy with one little word; nevertheless. I was unable to put it down. I feel so much more knowledgeable now as to how to handle the enemy, especially when I'm up against adversity or even someone who wants to debate God and His word. Dr. Mark Rutland has such a gift when it comes to words and his little dialogues with God in this book were amusing and insightful. I would recommend this book to Christians of any age or level of experience in their walk with God."
5,Another Way Home,"This is a wonderful read. Beautifully written, and a fascinating bio of an exceptional woman whose life spans a time of crucial transition in American history. Everyone should read this book."
3,Often Awkward Phrasing,"I was roped into getting this for a college class. The subject matter was not terribly riveting, due to both a lack of interest and a difficulty getting through the chapters. Definitely not a book I would read for kicks and giggles. I kid you not, one passage in this book has scarred me for life. It involves comparing a pubescent girl's first period to blood colored lightning... something I found extremely unsettling :s Though the book is not my style, it manages to illustrate some valid points about society in Louisiana while sticking with a common theme of family. I didn't enjoy it, but I'm sure some would get a kick out of it. It's well edited and researched, making any historian's fantasy of legitimate sources a reality."
5,"Sit back, relax, and enjoy","I loved this book, I purchased it for genealogy research, my plan was to skim the book for references to my research. So many times I found myself reading pass my point of reference that I just gave up and read the whole book. Great story, great details. I shared the book with my father who lived in Chicago at one point in his life and he enjoyed both the story and the emotional return trip to Chicago."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Just a poor immitation of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Uninspiring music, vocals and her whole image is a cheap immitation of the other successful teen divas."
2,There are better alternatives,"I am not sure who the audience is here. But there are better alternatives in any category.For Indo-Pop (which I do not love), try Alisha's quirky Made in India.For Bollywood (which I also do not love), try Bollywood Funk (which I do love)For Indian Fushion with Club Beats, there are much better alternatives all over the place. Try Talvin Singh."
5,"Brilliant, useful writing by a first-class thinker and teacher","Susan Jeffers is a national expert on fear and tools to move past fear. This book is a recent effort, and is in a sense the next stage past her best-seller ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway."" She takes what has to be one of the most unnerving topics for most people to even consider, embracing the uncertainty of life, and offers pragmatic, clear tools for doing exactly that. Just the discussion of letting go of outcomes should be required reading for anyone 10 years old and up. While the book has a spiritual leaning it is by no means necessary to be of any spiritual belief, or even spiritual at all, to find this book highly useful."
2,Disappointing,"Despite many very positive reviews, this book was ultimately disappointing. Not to say nothing can be taken from it, but the useful bits are stuffed between a lot of garbage.I was immediately turned off in the introduction by some annoyingly hokey sentences, for example: ""As you travel through this book, you will take a magical journey into the mind and into the spirit."" It's magical!Also the concept in the first chapter didn't quite tickle my fancy. It suggests you replace hope with wonder. Somehow I don't think I would feel comforted as I walked through a minefield (or whatever) thinking ""I wonder if I'll make it across alive.""There are many mystical and religious ideas called on, particularly in the second half of the book, that I found pretty much useless. It makes reference to the ""Grand Design"" and the reader's ""Highest Good,"" yet claims that a belief in God is not necessary (title of chapter 10: ""Let God Worry About It!"").Anyway, I didn't like it."
3,"OK, but tried to be to cover too many models.","I have purchased Haynes manuals before. I have happily used them as a quick-reference supplement to more comprehensive repair manuals. This manual contains useful information, photos and instruction on maintenance and repair. However, this time, Haynes tried to cover too many models for manual this size. The Integra, Civic and the CRV do share the same basic engine and other components. They also have differences and not all of those are covered. This manual should have been at least twice as thick. Then it would be more expensive. This is the first Haynes I have been disappointed with. I still use it though."
5,Good book.,This got me out of a lot of jams and saved me a lot of money by giving some more confidence.
5,A One Man Rebellion...,"Mr. Jones has come a along way since his career began in the late 1980's. No longer just the pretty boy horror star, Andras has proved himself worthy of his indie rocker status with his ""A Curmudgeon for All Seasons"" album. Full of humor, political insight, and an alternative perspective...'Curmudgeon' is a musical epiphany, lifting the curtain on some of the droll pop/folk music of recent and bringing finally bringing some light to the stage."
2,"SAPPY,FIRELESS EASY-LISTENING [MUSIC]","Thank goodness that Mariah Carey moved on from safe,middle-of-the road dreck like this instead more intresting,slinkier material.This 3-CD set is filled with the pablum that we loved to hate.Mariah has a beautiful voice but tired,flat ballads like ""I Don't Wanna Cry"",""Hero"",and the like don't compliment it.Want to check out the sexier,more intresting Mariah pick up""Butterfly""(1997) or ""Glitter""(2001)."
4,"A little difficult to start, but worth it!","I'm really surprised at the poor reviews this has received.I've had this on my shelf for a while and finally picked it up and read it.It was a bit slow at first and I will say the ""political"" dealings on Ball Four tended to have me skimming. Actually, I didn't really care for the newspaper reports, but I do see that they are integral to the story.Bottom line, though, is that I stuck with it and by the time I got to the ""Universe Series"", I was hooked and the descriptions of those games were excellent. I thought the baseball was quite good and pretty exciting.I think the low reviews are way off. By the end I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,I like these filters,"These are really good filter wrenches for some VW models and Subaru's. They make removing the filter very easy. Like stated in the earlier review, it's expensive for what you get, but it's very good to have. Also, unlike the other review, these are not used to tighten. You don't use wrenches to tighten. The only one's that you use wrenches to tighten are your oil filters that are inside of a casing, which I think are typical on diesels."
3,nothing special,I bought this cd when it first came out a few years ago and paid six dollars for it and thought that was expencive. seeing how there is only 4 songs on it and 3 are live. selling it for this price is outrages.
5,Another FANTASTIC CD from Monty Harper,"Monty Harper is a genius! This CD demonstrates his imaginative, creative style. I love the variety of songs on it. They are all mellow. I really love ""No Blues At All""... what a lovely, heart-warming song. This is really appropriate for adults as well as children. Fun, catchy, and nice to listen to... really worth buying!"
5,Truth,This book by Bell Hooks is absolutely fantastic! She is great at using her personal narratives to convey the mentality of U.S. higher education faculty in a manner that encourages one to pursue professorial teaching as a privilege and purposeful development of students first before anything. Great read for anyone who plans/attends a college university.
4,"interesting, insightful read","I am reading this book for my Introduction to Feminisms class. So far, I have been enlightened by bell hooks' thoughts and experiences as an African American teacher. She clearly and effectively explains her stance on race relations and white supremacy in the context of her life experiences."
2,NEW GLIDE BUT NOT BETTER,"I have been using almay anti-perspirant since I was very young.I have an allergy to all other anti-perspirants and can only useAlmay. I have recently tried the new glide, and I am now noticing an irritation. I used to use the solid stick and can not seem to find it anymore. There is obviously different ingredients in this new product and I am not happy with that."
3,Regular Deodorant,In response to the previous review of Almay Deodorant. Your allegy is most likely due to aluminum zirconium or to zinc which is used in most deodorant products. Try another deodorant that does not include any zinc and you might notice a change in your skin's reaction to the product.
1,Broken Handle,Husband loves the briefcase but the screws fell out of the handle after 3 months and cannot find any replacements.
3,Dont wear a scarf but I like them anyway,Have to disagree about Spacemen 3 being boring. Seeing that this is a CD of singles and not an album its hard to say this is a good way to hear them.PLAYING WITH FIRE or PERFECT PRESCRIPTION are the ones to get. and most of the songs arent one chord they are 2 or 3. Drugs...Rugs? thats not the point and dont matter.Minimal soothing songs that are catchy in my opinion DRONE ON!!
2,"content OK, but printing and structure is bad","Content is OK, but 10 years old, so no recent new insights. The book is no fun to study. The quality of the printing is bad (like someone printed it on an old printer an then made some copies), some diagrams are hardly readable. Furthermore the structure is not recognizable in the formatting (for example paragraph titels), which makes it hard to know on which abstraction level you are reading."
5,Sweatshirt,"Extremely fast delivery. The sweatshirt fits perfectly and is made from very nice quality material, 80% cotton, 20% polyester. It's made in Honduras and the tag says the[...]. I've had many crew neck sweatshirts over the years and this has to be one of the nicest ones I've ever owned."
1,DISAPPOINTING!,Found this book very disappointing. Nothing really new or surprising in this book. Go to the library or use the internet to do research on paying for nursing school.
3,Male condom felt better.,"I ordered these hoping we might like them better than male condoms. He had mentioned the loss of sensation using a male condom and we wanted to try something different. It may be that these condoms simply don't work with our anatomy. I believe the women who say it has helped with larger or uncircumcised men, so if that is your situation please don't let this review put you off. The female condom simply didn't work for us. I couldn't feel a thing. Like he might as well have been having sex with someone else. He complained that it felt like ""sex with a plastic bag"". If male condoms are working well for you and your partner, I would recommend sticking with them. If however you need a different option, I think these are definitely effective and certainly other couples have had more success.I was also disappointed to get these just in an padded envelope and not in the original box."
3,HARD TO FIND IN STORES,"I HAVE NOT USED THE PRODUCT YET, BUT WAS UNSATISFIED WITH IT COMING IN A PLASTIC BAG AND NOT THE ORIGINAL BOX."
5,Directed us to delightful places not in any other guide book,"After taking a tour at the Botanical Gardens, we followed Ms. Harriott's recommedation and ate at the hospital cafe across the street. And who did we see but our tour guide from the gardens. Boy, was he surprised to see us! How did we ever find out about this place?? The Maverick Guide, of course. The fish cakes are delicious, by the way. This book is a great way to get to out-of-the way places and a real flavor of Bermuda. Highly recommended!"
5,"Great For Tourists, Bermudians AND Travel Agents!",This book is incredible; Ms. Harriott obviously knows Bermuda extremely well and has checked and re-checked her information. As someone specializing in helpling people plan their Bermuda vacations I constantly use the book as a resource. It has been invaluable to me.As far as the slight error mentioned in another review I don't think there is a soul out there that doesn't know September 11th as the date our world crashed down. It was obviously an editorial mistake!
2,Worried about the accuracy of this book.....,"Page 22: ""Important Note: Since the events of September 9, 2001, to ensure the safety of your flight the airline rules have changed dramatically...""Although the parts I did read I enjoyed, this seemed like rather a large error and made me question the accuracy of the rest of the information. Unless I missed something in the news on 9/9/01."
4,Smooth mix of boogie and blues from an unknown.,"Camille Howard's sultry singing and smokey piano playing is as comfortable as a silk robe, and goes down as smooth as cognac. Perfect music for the cocktail hour. Popular on the 'colored' music charts in the late 40s and early 50s, she was never able to cross-over; a huge loss. Read the liner notes for her interesting story."
5,Life Extension Products,I have used Life Extension products for a year now and have found the products are pharmaceutical grade and well worth the price.Life Extension - Chlorophyllin with Zinc - - 100 capsules
5,awsome,Always ship these items quick and always come back here cause the items are cheaper here on Amazon than buying in the store
4,One of Fury's better albums...,"Although the album isn't quite as great as ""Brilliant Thieves,"" it does have a very strong impact, a definitive sense of style and grace. Fury is one of the best bands that hasn't been discovered by the mainstream. Do your self a favor. Buy a fury album or two.Songs on Mono that are spectacular: ""Every Generation Got Its own Disease,"" ""radio orchid"" and, if this is the import version, ""Haunted Head & Heart."""
4,Thoughtful and well crafted,"This is the best album that Fury produced. You may remember one of the tracks from the radio, entitled ""Every Generation Has It's Own Disease"", but that is only the beginning. The band is very adept at matching the tone and pace of their music with the mood and sentiment of the lyrics in front of them, creating songs which tell stories or are just intended to provoke emotion. This is one of those CD's that you can put in the player, hit shuffle, and let the whole thing go."
5,Great Product!,I have used all kinds of oil paint and this is a very nice paint. The price is very good I would not normally buy this much paint but at this price you can not go wrong. I was a little skeptical after reading one of the reviews about the tube breaking but took the chance and I am very happy very nice product!!!
5,Color,"not to say of a painting. good, nice and cheap. ship quality, all fine, safe and fast. Forward as the elephant"
1,"Should read ""substantially"" Revised Edition","Purchased this to give as a gift. Upon receiving, I thumbed through the pages and could tell that substantial amounts of text were not included in this ""revised edition"". I pulled out my personal copy and confirmed by comparing pages that substantial material (whole paragraphs and citations) were omitted from this ""revised edition"". NP if it were a word or two, but this is not the case. I would pass on this revised edition and go with the ""classic coke"" edition."
2,o.k for light tourism; not comprehensive,"This map has the main tourist areas covered as well as outlyers like Barra, but this would not be sufficient is you were renting a car or wanted to find a street located outside the beach areas or downtown."
5,A Fine Shredder,"Have used this shredder for several months. Destroyed about two baskets of paper in one sitting, without overheating, never putting more than two sheets in at a time, letting each group of paper complete it's shred. This is the third shredder I've owned and it is well worth the extra money. Avoid the ones on sale - just remember, you get what you pay for. Take care of it, don't overload it and it will last a long time."
2,Not as promised!,"I thought I had a winner until I used it to shred a CD (which it is advertised to do). After one CD the machine no longer works at all. As a paper shredder it worked great and I would recommend it, but unless my case is an exception, you might think twice about considering it a ""heavy-duty"" shredder."
2,Great until it stopped,"I thought I'd finally solved my shredder problem, as I had gone through at least 3 Fellowes shredders over the course of the last 7 years or so. I only shred about 10 pages a day on average, and every so often I shred a whole banker's box of old receipts, etc. That's what I was doing today when it jammed - and made a terrible noise as it did so. We took it apart, but couldn't find anything. It's still jamming. I will probably have to scrap it. It did seem to be a little more robust; the plastic parts to either side of the blades are more sturdy than on the Fellowes shredders. But the blade mechanism is exactly the same. I wish I could say, ""Buy this other kind - the blades are better/different,"" but I don't have any idea if such a thing exists for less than $1500."
2,Works great until the nylon gear gave out!,"It worked good until the nylon gear stripped. I only used it for at home shredding. I tried to not over stuff it as instructed, but all of a sudden it started making a slight clicking sound then it quit shredding, however the motor is still trying to engage the gears, but the one nylon gear has a bad spot on it. If you get it off that bad spot the gear spins one rotation until it hits the spot again. It will be cheaper to buy a new one than have this one repaired. I bought it at Sam's for $99 and got one year out of it!"
5,Mighty Dog YES!,"My daughter borrowed this book from the library without even looking at the cover. She just pulled it from the shelf and ran for the checkout counter. What a gem! She loves it and it's the first book her 17 month old brother has ever taken an interest in. Maybe it's because I read it with a cornpone accent. But whatever it is, he never tires of reading it. I read it to him 4 times in one day and he was still begging for it at bedtime. The illustrations are fun and complement the writing beautifully. I had a hoot reading it!"
3,Middle of the Road,"I'll start by saying I am a big fan of NOW but this effort seemed a bit shallow lacking the creativity and funk I heard on Carboot and Smoker's. I will say that Summertime is a great track and if amazon, itunes, or emusic has it as a single mp3 I would recommend adding that to your collection. Signing off now, thank you for reading this entire review right down to the very very very last word. Bye."
4,good stuff!,"Knillssonn or how ever you spell it, is the LP you throw on an hour before bed time. Just kick back, relax and enjoy! This one is pretty, can't say it is rock & roll. It's not his best work in my opinion, but it wont dissapoint. I recomend a glass of wine, a cigarette, and headphones with this record. I don't own the Import CD, i have this one on vinyl. To me it sounds great though.""RCA record and Tapes"""
3,Excellent Study of Longsword ...But Bad pictures,I think this is an excellent book on the German Longsword form !! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the pictures are too dark and grainy !!! Otherwise it is a wonderful book !! I hope that the publisher fixes this problem in the future !!
3,Good for Preserving the Art,"Christian Henry Tobler presents a lot of information in this work, which some have dubbed the 'german' version of ""The Swordsman's Companion"" by Guy Windsor. In my opinion, Windsor's work is the better of the two, containing more concise and clear descriptions of the techniques, but since it's about the Italian tradition, Tobler's book is a better choice for those interested in the Liechtenauer tradition.There are a few bonuses in this book. Not only does he discuss fighting with the longsword, he also demonstrates spear-fighting, medieval grappling, with or without a sword, half-sword techniques, and fighting in armor.Having bought both his book, and Windsor's, I favor ""The Swordsman's Companion"" perhaps because Windsor doesn't play dress up while he's teaching swordsmanship."
4,"Comics that are grotesque, but then so is life","This book contains examples of the grotesque style of comics. Unlike the earlier versions that had to be clean and with a positive, wholesome message, these are dark, sinister and unfortunately more accurately reflect reality. People are homeless, destitute, suffer from illnesses and seem to continuously be at most only one step away from disaster. There is racism, sexism, brutality, profanity and if the title is to be believed, it is largely autobiographical.If you are someone who prefers to have their comics sanitized and unrealistic, then you will not like this book. However, if you are primarily a realist and can see beyond the superficial, you will understand the reality and appreciate the various levels of satire."
2,"Thought it would be good, but wasn't.","My daughter has tried a few of the Special Effects hair dyes and loved them. Because she really likes purple, we decided to try Joyride. Unfortunately, we discovered it is different than some of the other SE's that we've tried. It's more like a glaze and washed out/faded VERY quickly (within LESS than a week), and this was on bleached hair. Very disappointed - but we've tried Wildflower and liked it, so we'll probably go back to that one. It's very dark, but stays in longer."
4,My oldest son learned to swim with this video,"When my oldest son was four he learned to swim by watching this video. I didn't do much at all to instruct him, except to remind him to kick his feet and keep him safe in the water (he loved to jump right in even before he could swim). After several days of practice he got the hang of keeping his head above water and from there continued to improve his swimming mostly on his own. This was a self motivated kid and not at all afraid of the water. He just ""knew"" he could swim after he saw how easy it was on the video. I guess a picture was worth a thousand words and the video certainly seemed to inspire our little swimmer."
1,Not much to go on here.,"I was stunned at how short this video is (10 1/2 minutes). I expected more step by step advice. Instead, she says things like ""Teach your child to roll."" Uh, how, exactly? There are not many demonstrations of HOW to teach something and I get the feeling the child she is working with already KNOWS all this stuff! I haven't shown it to my granddaughter yet and she may enjoy watching it, but I don't feel it taught me anything that will help me teach her to swim."
1,There is only 6 minutes of teaching,"YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED. There are a couple of good points, however, the whole video could have been covered in a pamphlet. I don't believe there is anything in this video that will speed up the process of learning to swim."
1,chip case,"this is not the best case out there and it is not strength upgraded, first of all there is no key lock or if there is you cant see it and it isnt mentioned, also there is no foam in the uppper part the lid inside , you cant see it and they dont mention it. it doesnt have rounded corners these are square therefore bumping into things solid instead of sliding off, at 29.00 used if you think your geting the best for yor money. your wrong this aint it"
3,Little sister #1,Hi my name is Teresa and I go to SANTA ROSA CHARTER SCHOOL.I think this is very good but use more discriptune. Ok now I will tell you why I liked this book. This book is one that you cant stop reading it there is somthing that you just cant wate to find out what will happen.This book is about A girl that thinks her neighber is a witch. This girl is allmost seven her name is Karen and she is kind of short. So she starts to spy on her and dous all cinds of things.
5,Outstanding portrait of a neighborhood! Five stars reading,"Whether you live in the nation's capital, Chevy Chase self or have an interest in architecture and history, this book is sure to please you. Beautifully written and illustrated, this is ***** reading. Sure to feature prominently on my coffee table for a long time too!"
3,A Promising Resource with One Shortcoming,"The idea behind this Companion is wonderful: collect into one book the texts that are referred to in the footnotes of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. This would allow readers ready access to the church documents, biblical passages, and spiritual writings related to the material in the Catechism. BUT, this Companion includes only texts which appear as indirect references, that is, those indicated by ""Cf."" in a footnote. It does not contain texts that are quoted by the catechism -- even if only a few words are quoted. This is a serious shortcoming for someone interested in studying the background sources.The book's Preface explains that it includes the texts of ""indirect references,"" but I do not think the title of the book makes this clear. The Reader should be aware of what is lacking."
4,evil harvest was a real page turnergreat true crime,Evil harvest was so well written. The contents of the book and the impeccable skills of this author really brings this story to life. Excellent true crime that doesn't focus to much on the trial but on whaat the readers want to hear ie: about the characters. I love the way he gives you an understanding into the minds of all the characters. Reaaly makes you understand what lead to the ultimate down fall of average good folks. I will look forward to reading more by this fine author.
4,Too much detail.,"I wonder why anyone would buy a book like this, or why anyone would want to write the story. It is shocking and stomach wrenching in it's detail and I think more true about Michael Ryan than the writer even knows. I was afraid of Mike almost 40 years ago when I dated his sister. He was cruel and had an explosive temper then too. I am sorry for everyone, including his wife and son, who he lead off into his dark world. It is too bad it came to this and I am amazed to find he is still on death row in Nebraska. I hope he never gets out, it would be a frightening thing to know he was not behind bars."
5,A True Crime Classic,"This is one of those books that probes the dark side of humanity. When I read a true-crime story, I'm looking for answers -- Rod Colvin gives them here in a compelling, harrowing narrative."
4,Really Excited/A Little Dissapointed,"I'm a HUGE Alice fan, and when this book came out- I was really excited! But when I read it... I was only a little dissapointed. Nothing REALLY REALLY exciting happened, besides Alice's father getting married. But I'm always going to love the Alice series no matter how bad they are (but this one wasn't bad.) But I do warn you, if you haven't read any of these books before, I suggest you read a different one from the series, to get a taste of what her really good work is, because as much as this book is good, it's not one of the best."
1,Bought three of these and all three were defective,"I just wanted to alert potential Brikka buyers that there may be several batches of defective Brikkas floating around on the market. So far I've gone through three of them and all three were defective -- very poorly machined, sharp jagged edges, gaskets that don't fit, loose safety valves, flakes of metal floating in the brewed coffee (not good!), etc. Maybe I'll try again at some point in the future once the defective batches have disappeared. Hopefully Bialetti's quality control will improve by then.On the bright side, Amazon makes it very easy to return defective merchandise. Kudos for that."
5,amazing!,This will match or even beat some hundres dollar machines! Produces great crema. Just make sure the beans aren't too fine.
5,Amazing!,"Amazing little coffe / espresso pot, it's quick to brew my cup of espresson and easy to rinse and clean afterwards."
4,Great Crema!,"I have used nothing else since receiving the Brikka. The coffee crema is wonderful. I found I needed to go with a darker roast that I use with my standard mokka. Not sure why this is necessary, but lighter roast taste flat in this unit.The first unit I received didn't screw together well and leaked around the pressure valve. I must say though that the seller, Amiganien, did a great job replacing the unit promptly. The second unit works great."
1,Burns Coffee Every Time,"Every time I use this pot it creates very burned, bitter coffee. The valve on top is supposed to remain sealed keep the water from mixing with the coffee until a certain pressure is reached and the water is quickly forced through the grounds. Unfortunately, this isn't what happens. Instead, the valve allows air to pass through, and then the water slowly reaches the top and trickles out very slowly. The valve isn't fully released for another minute. In that minute , your coffee is burning as the hot water is at a near standstill in the basket with your grounds. If the brikka's top valve actually sealed, then I think the brikka idea would work, but instead, the brikka's poor execution produces burnt coffee every time."
4,Great bar stools at a good price,"These are great bar stools and relatively easy to put together. My youngest child does like spinning on them rather too much which means the nuts and bolts holding the seat on need to be re-tightened some times, which is why they lose a star, but when I next go to Home Depot I'll get some nylon thread lock nuts which should help. Overall good quality for the money."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Horrible customer service full of false promises. Items came missing one of the plastic feet for the legs. I have contacted them 6 times to get one set to me so I don't have wobbly seats, was promised it would ship and still have not received. The part probably cost 20 cents. Absolutely insane that a company would not make a customer satisfied over such an inexpensive item."
2,bar stool chairs,"Although the price is cheap, the quality is also cheap. The chairs LOOK awesome, but unfortunately the cushions rip easily. If youw ill use these frequently, I would get a higher quality stool."
1,Not a fun game,Don't buy this game. Too much BS reading. I bought this for my 11 years old son and he didn't like it. He got stuck after crossing the first bridge. The game is now sitting there collecting dust!
1,Dissapointed to say the least.,This has to be the worse Mario game ever. I love Mario games and this was very dissapointing. First you have to click and read through 10 minutes of back and forth messages. Then you have to read crap like every other minute. The game itself is also dum. I would say it is for a 3 year old but they would not be able to read it. It is really dumb. Sorry I wasted my money on it. On ebay it goes after the boycott.
1,So do you play it or just read?,"This is horrible! I am so glad I rented this game opposed to buying it outright but it isn't even worth the $7 rental fee and after 30 mins, well that's 30mins of my life I'll never see again.I gave up. There is NOTHING but scrolling through lame story. There's no game here, if there is, you have to endure more than 30 mins of bad music and lame dialog bubbles or worthless chatter. You get to walk a few feet then MORE talk and dialog bubbles of worthlessess.If I could give less than 1 star I would."
1,Boring,Mario sets out on his most boring review. To much talking and not enough action. Very few rpg elements that used to be present. Oversimplified gameplay that children wouldn't enjoy because of the huge amount of text.
4,Minor improvements,"I did enjoy playing Super Paper Mario, but like some other reviewers I thought there were some changes that needed to be made to improve the game. The amount of dialogue that you have to read through is insane. My mother usually likes to watch me play games, but she decided that she couldn't stand sitting there through all of the chatter. Another thing is the graphics. I know this is Super PAPER Mario, but come on! The new characters look as if they were made in paint. I seriously believe I could have created the characters in paint with line and fill color. Nintendo, you should have done better."
2,Not for smaller kids!,"Okay, I admit that I personally am not video game savvy, so maybe there is some prejudice here. But my 7-year old grandson plays video games all the time, so I think I can speak for him.From what we could tell from the time we loaded this game is that there is a lot of reading required. And I don't mean short instructional type info. They want you to get the whole story and the whole background of whatever is happening but it is wa-a-ay too indepth and complicated to keep the interest of a 7-year old, not to mention the vocabulary (including character names) are often well beyond that of a child.Luckily, I only paid 19.99 for this game as an Amazon special. I am hoping I can sell it to someone and at least get back some of this cost. In the future, I will be sure and read the reviews before I take the (E)rating as meaning that it is kid-friendly."
2,Not meant to be a platformer... Highly disappointing...,"If you are a fan of the original games, do not bother buying this game because it is awful. I was hesitant to buy this game for years and finally purchased it and I should have followed my initial instinct. It totally eliminated turn based battles, which sometimes became tedious in the other games, but that's what really made the originals stand out for me. This game is also missing the creativity in puzzles and plot that the original had. I got exactly halfway through this game and I could not play it anymore. It's almost like it tries to be too cool to the point that it's like a 30 year old woman that dresses in leggings, wears juniors shirts, and says ""ttyl"" and ""ily"" in text messages - it's just ridiculous and awkward."
4,"One can do no better, for enjoyment long time!","Great game-a bit heavy on dialogue, but very creative and addictive. Right behind zelda in my book (so far)."
3,Ok Game,I love the original Mario games for the older nintendo. This game is different and at times you get lost in where you are going. The first few levels pose little challenge. Will be looking forward to the release of the new Mario Brothers for the Wii Nov 15th.
3,Not what i expected.,"This is one time it would have paid to do some research. I bought this game unaware of the previous RPG nature of the Paper Mario series. This game actually shares quite a bit in common with Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia for the DS: a central village, shops, some controls and stylistic elements, which i find a bit odd. It's strange to play a Mario game with experience points, hit points (heart points) and so forth. It certainly isn't anything like two of my favourites: Super Mario World (SNES) and New Super Mario Brothers (DS). This is not an action game, it's a series of puzzles and dialogue. If you like puzzles, you'll love this game; if you want action, this one isn't for you."
4,Fair,"A great game on its own, but a fair addition to the ""Paper Mario"" series. Super Paper Mario attempts to blend the RPG with the sidescroller format to varying results. While it is a lot of fun it almost feels like this title should have had your party members following behind you and made it an Real Time Action Battle System of some sort.Don't get me wrong though, this game is as good as it gets and the story and ending brought a tear to my eye, but this game should have been a completely different series, not an evolution of Paper Mario"
3,Not for young kids,"My son begged for Super Mario Bros. Unfortunately, he asked a year too early. I got him this game and it was not a wise choice. He was 5 and just learning to read. This game is FULL of reading. The story line is narrated through word bubbles; the characters talk to each other through word bubbles; the directions from signposts are in bubbles. If you can't read, you can't play this game. It's a fun game. I enjoy flipping between dimensions. The plot is fun and the scenes change in the spirit of the original Super Mario Bros. Older players will enjoy this game in the spirit of the original adventure."
3,Paper Mario is 5 star on paper only,"Start playing this game, you will be annoyed so much with the theory and story telling and no way to bypass it. Unnecessary stretched and stretched, you will keep pressing buttons to move ahead will be so annoying, u will wish to just close it and go away. I am not a hardcore gamer, I want to enjoy for whatever time I get after my busy day, I don't want to be bored like this.but 2D and 3D concept is good and its worth trying once."
3,"Fun, but lots of dialog","I thought this game was pretty fun, but it was really annoying to have to read so much dialog about the story. I was expecting it to be more like the original mario brothers games (from the nintendo/super nintendo) based on the fact that it had 2d graphics, and the video that I saw of the gameplay. I wasn't expecting something like mario rpg. That being said, the gameplay that was there, was pretty fun. There are a lot of homages to other games, for instance on one of the later levels you get to fight a boss in a horizontal scrolling shooter mode, which is pretty fun. The game isn't too difficult to execute, it's more of a ""dang where's that doorway"" type puzzle in places.. at least, that's where I had the most problems (it wasn't from dying)."
3,Super Paper Mario--A Disappointmnet,This is not a true WII game...save your money...this is only a one player game.
3,"Fun, but abusive of wiimote's potential","This game has great sections, is incredibly innovative and seems like it will last a while, and if I were playing this for the gamecube than I would be happy as a clam.UNFORTUNATELY, the game barely uses the wiimote whatsoever which gives you a semi-hollow feeling inside because the wii is based around the wiimote.Basically, the game will last a long time, brings back the good old days of Super Mario Bros. (Trust me, if your not a fan of that this game will change it because of better plot and role-playing rather than just old-fashioned levels, and will give you a nice, fun challenge, but the misuse of the wiimote leaves this game kind of iffy and sometimes you just wish that you culd do something more active...I would recommend spending your money on a more innovative wii game though this one is still fun."
1,Too much BLAH BLAH BLAH,"I bought the wii and paper mario because I was craving a little old school 2D mario action. I think this game is pretty satisfying once you get going and I enjoy it, but I dread all the stupid blathering. The dialog might be ok if it were sort but it isn't even that. It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on with inane stupid conversations that consist of nothing better than ""I'm better than you!"" ""Nuh uh!"" ""Yeah huh!"" ""Nuh uh!"" And if, for example you don't beat the villain at the end of the level you have to scroll through the entire stupid conversation AGAIN! Horrible, just horrible.I was babysitting a tween recently and they didn't even stick with the game for more than 5 minutes because they said there was too much reading and not enough playing.Ugh. I want to play not read!"
3,A kid's review,"I am going to say the pros and cons of the game.Pros: 1. It is a very fun game2. The character's abilities and pixls are fun to use.Cons: 1. WAY TOO EASY!!2. After you beat the game, there is basicly nothing to do.Overall a 3. I recommend renting, not buying the game."
3,Okay,This game wasn't as I expected. I tried it a few times but couldn't figure out the beginning part. I think after that stage the game wan't too bad. Well from what I seen when other people were playing it. At least someone enjoyed it.
3,A lot of text...,"Prepare to read and engross yourself in a novel. Started the game and there is a lot too read. It makes you not want to play the game because it takes so much time to read. Its a Mario game, its not suppose to be deep and life changing. Come on Nintendo...more gameplay next time."
