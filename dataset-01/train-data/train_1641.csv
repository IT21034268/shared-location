4,Awesome. But has a lame factor.,"Great version of the same second only to the PC version. The controls are great, graphics are great, online gameplay is great and the game itself is simply great. The GOTY edition however adds little to what you already own, you will still have to fork over m$ dollars for the add ons."
2,Not the best Zombie FPS,"The first problem with this game is the necessity to deal with STEAM. DO NOT buy a used STEAM enabled game. You will be out of luck when the license needs to be validated. The advantage is that the game can be installed in multiple PC's with a single STEAM ID then played from any ONE PC without the original media. Left 4 Dead, for my taste, seems to be too repetitive for single player. I am not able to indulge in multi-player very much. For a single player the most fun Zombie game is ""Stubbs The Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse""."
2,BEWARE of the fine print,"I love FPS and Co-Op games.There are some catches with this product that you should know before buying.In the past, you could install a game and play it; just that simple.With this game you have to sign up for a steam account and you have to start the game online the first time to activate the game.ALSO, you have to be online for 2/3 of the games options.If you do not have broadband, you can just forget being able to do this.I cannot stand paying $50 for a game and not being able to play it with my family on a LAN. These developers are trying to micro-manager their games and it is going to backfire."
3,Bought for variety of customs,Hilarity often ensues.... unfortunately I think half the people that play this game are those morons that scream and jump at every shrill sound in the theater. Since this game is coop to the EXTREME (mnt dew! Woo!... right... moving on)this can be a little annoying.
5,If you're a Zombie fan....,"....Then you'll probably really like this game. It installed and runs perfectly on my Intel Core Duo with NVIDIA GeForce GTS 250 1GB card. Windows 7. The game looks great, and it's got plenty of creep factor. I think most complaints are irrelevant now that the game is less expensive. If you like ""things zombie,"" you'll enjoy."
1,Probably a good toy but can't find batteries for it.,I have tried to order the batteries online but I am having trouble getting a place that carries the 9.6 V NiCd Battery Pack and Charger. The car isn't much fun if you can't run it.
4,loved it,"can't wait to read more of this series, it is god reading, just eats up the hours one you are invoved."
5,Cowboy,I liked this book..! Ashton needed something in his life and so did Beth. The phone conversations were a little dull and maybe could have had a spark here or there but the author did a good job..!
5,Very good book,"This story held my interest most of the way through. It got drug down a little toward the end, but made a good come back and a good ending. I would recommend this book."
3,Cowboy,"I received a complimentary copy of this book to review it. This is the first book I have read by Staci Stallings. I really got into the book in the beginning; but about 2/3 into it, it started to drag on and on for me.The development, with God's help, of Beth and Kenzie, Lynn, and Ashton Raines was well done. You really got to know them, their feelings, and what made them into the person they were. Their struggles, joys, heartbreaks and what God can do if you only let Him. Forgiveness is a journey as is love. Staci dug deep into Beth and Ashton's souls and showed God's way compared to their way. A journey with all kinds of emotions and bumps along the way. Money won't buy happiness or love or will it? Staci shows what sacrifices can do in one's life. Enjoyable book."
5,wonderful,"I recieved a complimentory copy of cowboys , and could not put it down !! this book is so deep and so profound , you can't wait to read the next oneI can see God's hand guiding Staci as she wrote this book. Thank you staci !!Madge Henagan"
4,Cowboy,"Anyone who has loved someone and grieved for a long time usually thinks their life is over. This story is about giving your anger,frustration and grief over to a higher power. It works through daily problems and thinking of others before one's self. In the process they grow in God's grace. Through communication, they find friendship and eventually love."
4,Cowboy,This story was enjoyable. Its a nice read and isn't trashy like some casual books. It kept my interest and I would look for more Staci Stallings books.
5,Beautiful CLEAN Christian romance!!,"I read a lot of Christian romances, this is one of my all time favorite. It has a twist of humor and reality that is very appealing. Lovely read!"
1,The Cowboy,The story dragged on - way too long and not terribly interesting. I found myself skimming most of the pages. Very disappointing.
3,A wholesome Christian Novel,"It all started when Beth, a widowed single mother working at a crappy diner, was convinced to go to a Concert with a friend and upon returning home that night she received a phone call requesting her help at the diner for a grave yard shift. Little did she realize that God had a plan ready to take place; during Beth's shift that night she reached out to help a lost soul in need, Timothy. Beth never asked for anything in return, but did she get in deeper than she had expected?Cowboy is a good read, the characters are life-like and the storyline is romantic and centered around God."
4,Cowboy,"A refreshing and entertaining book. At a time when Christianity is being attacked from all sides, this book shows you faith and prayer are important."
3,An Ok--Take on Home Alone,I am a MAJOR Home Alone fan-- I loved the first and second and the third was quite good. This is a series that keeps on going downhill though. I just saw the fifth one and it is my least favorite. I do own all of the Home Alone's that are released though so they are doing something right--plus I want a completed collection.
3,My nephew loves the Home Alone movies,"I personally only like the first Home Alone. I forced myself to watch the second one, but I couldn't watch this one because it was so cheap. It doesn't matter that I don't like it, because my nephew loves these movies and the traps that the kid sets up. I got this for a Christmas present to make him happy."
1,Just about the worst movie I've ever seen,"My title says it all. It's not even worth reviewing -- it's that bad. It's embarrassing that anyone even put the time hitting the ""record"" button on the camera to film this disaster."
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars.,"1 star to me means this movie has very little goodness which it doesn't. Home Alone 4 is the worst Home Alone movie which 2 is close behind. Something that could of saved this movie is the acting. Yes they brought back Kevin but the orginal Kevin is to old; why not a new charcher like Alex Pruitt from Home Alone 3. Home Alone 1 & 3 are really great movies that you can enjoy. Why bring back the ""McCallisters"" when you change the adults too even Merv which the orignal (Daniel Stern) played changed. This movie just dosen't make sense why is Kevien younger in this movie.Home Alone 4 should have been made in 1999 and Alex D. Linz should have had the role a sequil to Home Alone 3; (like from Home Alone 1 ""1990"" to Home Alone 2 ""1992"".)"
4,Home Alone 4 : Taking back the house,"Like any other Home Alone movie, not as good as the first one but of course different and ideal for ther whole family."
1,"This is not Home Alone, this is just crap","This is just omg [...], and not Home Alone if u wanna see real Home Alone movies get the first 3, cause this is just [...]."
1,Awfull,"This is simply awfull. Like Home Alone 3, we are introduced to the same 'people' as HA1 and HA2 but different actors who don't even look or act the same (Kevin McAllister has got younger!). The film looks rushed, is very poorly acted (with the exception of the young boy) and badly script and directed. I would advice you not to watch this movie. Enough said really."
3,Falsely Advertised,"I'll be honest, I didn't think Home Alone 4 was a bad movie. It's better than other Amazon reviews make it out to be. The real trouble is that this movie was advertised as being another sequel to the smash hit, Home Alone. It clearly isn't. Just because they use the same characters in the movie doesn't make it a sequel. Kevin gets into trouble every time his dad and his dad's girlfriend leave the house, and like in the third one, no one believes him about the bad guys. No traps for the bad guys this time, either. This is not a bad movie, but it isn't Home Alone. If you want a real Home Alone movie, get the first two. The third one is very good too."
1,Just what we need...,"I loved the first two because they were classics (well, Home Alone was a classic, Home Alone 2 was very good though). Home Alone 3, I thought, sucked. It was unnecassary. Two movies was enough for the Home Alone franchise. As painfully bad as Home Alone 3 was, this is, in fact, almost FUNNY because it is so bad! I mean, who could replace Culkin as Kevin and Daniel Stern as Marv and so on. NO ONE! But I guess I was wrong. When will Fox stop making this series suffer?! I mean, it's like beating a dead horse. Sorry, Home Alone 1 & 2 fans, with all due respect, please stay away from this. Especially if you expierenced the demise of the series (Home Alone 3)"
1,They Totally F*cked Everything Up!,Nobody in this movie look exactly like the Characters! You will not Augh in this movie. and who the hell would wanna give this a 6 out of 5. I know who. don't know the name though. but he/she must be a total idiot! the first 2 are better! I guess the classic last and then dies when it is ramded with a 4th! or 3rd!
2,Not the same,"First of all buzz it fat and this buzz is skinny + all the original cast were much better. The mother looks nothing like the original mother and the Kevins siblings are not as tuff on Kevin as before. I understand this is Home Alone 4, but this is supposted to take place during 1&2, more like a 1 1/2 so how is it that Kevins parents are not divorced in #2, but are in #4."
3,Okay but not as good as the first two!!!!,This movie was not as good as the first 2 with Machauly Culkin in it I didn't really like the 3rd movie with Alex D. Linz in it this was disapointed some of it was funny and some of it was stupid I don't know why they planned to make a 4th movie but they are really wrong to do this if they make a Home Alone 5 there in trouble cause all be angry with them. but all and all this was funny but I still say the first 2 were way better.
5,FANTASTIC SELLER!!!,Great Product. Wonderful Price. Fast Shipping. I will definitely buy from this seller again and HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!!!
2,"Not THAT bad, but still feels a little empty","all right... so this movie isn't bad. but it isn't that good either.the good things are that prescott is actually, well, good in some parts of the movie. also, they didn't call the kid another name like in home alone 3.the bad things are that lots of the actors didn't do very well in this film and the writing is terrible. The booby traps lasted for only 10 minutes!so either you don't watch this movie, rent it, or borrow it. don't spend your money on buying it."
2,Not Very Good,"This movie wasn't very good. Apperently,the people who directed this movie weren't very big fans of the first two.If I remember correctly, in the first and second movie wasn't Harry the one that wore the hat, not Marv? Not very many people notice that.The acting wasn't good either. The kid was terrible.He was a weenie.Don't waste your money on this movie."
3,Mozart Piano Concerto No. 19 & No. 23/Rondon in A Major,"It is a good CD for people who love Mozart's Piano Concerto. The only weakness in this CD is the Pianist John O'Conor. He is not strong enough to express Mozart's passion, otherwise, it would be a great CD to be collected."
2,I wanted to like it but,"I got this with the toothbrush Stimpy, Ren came with a broken eye so I shipped back for a refund but the item was sold out, not sure if I wanted another anyway as the eyes seem to break easily. So now my Toothbrushin Stimpy is lonely...."
3,"This CD is by Jana Thornton, not Jana Mashonee","Troy Santi's March 31 review got it right, this Jana is not the one who did ""Flash of a Firefly"". The photo in the CD liner is of a blonde white woman (Jana Mashonee is Lumbee Indian, at least enough that it shows in her face)who- by indications of her website link (nothing like Ms. Mashonee has)is a woman named Thornton.The musical style is as Amazon describes it, not too bad at times although I found myself skipping ahead pretty often.This Jana's voice might be pretty good but the music tends to overwhelm it, not like the Jana most people buying the CD are expecting.Amazon really needs to check closely when singers have such similar names, I know I can't be the only one who wouldn't have bought this CD if they'd been correct in who/what they associated it with."
2,Simply bland...,"Many wonderful and creative rave reviews on this cd, however the music doesn't measure up to the reviews. Technically speaking Clark seems to be a decent enough pianist, however his style is not distictive, in other words he sounds liek any other painist you would hear in a hotel cocktail lounge. Maybe with time and maturity this artist might aspire to be a great piasist he just needs to spread his wings and try other tings, and maybe he won't sound so dull. Until then, skip this one. I give it two stars for effort, and there's no doubt that the man has talent, he's just hasn't found a creative way to present it to us in the cd forman as of yet.Bottom line: This cd should be retitled ""SIMPLY BLAND."""
4,Good basic book,"I was looking for a non-text book for a college class I am teaching at a community college on Career Development. Good, basic book, some good assessments. I am pairing it with ""The Everything Career Tests"" Book."
2,Weak,This book does not help you to find a career...all it does is give you a list of jobs and tell you look them up to see if they sound appealing...you need a book to tell you that?
1,"Very basic, nothing new or noteworthy","Unfortunately, this guide is not much more than a compendium of basic job-hunting and career-choosing information. There's nothing particularly helpful or innovative here.If you are disabled, it does contain one or two chapters on how to handle your disability in the job hunting process that might be useful, but generally speaking this book is a waste of money."
5,A Must-Read for All Job/Career Seekers,"This truly step-by-step guide is not only thorough, it also demonstrates, through inspiring and uplifting stories of real people--some of whom have overcome incredible challenges--that finding a meaningful career is achievable for anyone who takes the time and makes the effort. Wilma Fellman expertly and deftly shows the way. Bravo."
4,Finding a career that works for you.,This is a great book for those who are starting careers over or for the first time.
5,Self-Help and/or Career Counselor's Tool,"Wow! This book is fantastic. I am a Ph.D., psychotherapist, counselor educator, and a career counselor; I find Fellman's book to be a wonderful tool. I will often use portions of it to help those I am doing therapy with. I am preparing to teach a masters' level class to counselor education students at the university in the Spring. FINDING A CAREER THAT WORKS FOR YOU will be at the top of the recommended reading list!"
2,Not The Old Troy-Built Company,"After my 22inch Yard-Man string trimmer died I was pleased to see Troy-Bilt offered a similar product. I read the previous review that stated problems with the broken oil tube. I have owned a Troy-Bilt rooter tiller for years and thought this was simply a unusual happening, after all Troy-Bilt makes the best. Little did I know the old Troy-Bilt went out of business and was aquired by MTD products. Well ten days later I received my trimmer and the oil tube was broken. With fire season on the way I taped the tube in place and used it to clear the brush. I called MTD products and between being keep on hold on the phone and getting the run around I gave up trying to get the replacement part under warranty. I ordered a new tube on line for $15 including shipping. This string trimmer is the old Yard-Man trimmer with a different engine. Last but not least the product worked well it just wasn't of old Troy-Bilt quality."
2,"Cumbersome, poor ergonomics, hard to adjust and use","I found these borderline unusable for three primary reasons:1) The interocular distance (spacing between the eyes) is quite narrow, at least for me, and non-adjustable2) There's a huge one-piece plastic cover for one end that's always in the way (but you wouldn't want to discard it, so you have to deal with it)3) The focus is sensitive and to properly do it you have to focus both ends of each eyepieceIn short, you'd never want to rely on these in a hurry, but if you have time to fight with the ergonomics and focusing then they do indeed actually function. I found, however, that unless you're within range of the built-in IR illuminators that the light-amplification was somewhat minimal. If you can see it through the binoculars, odds are you can see it unaided."
2,Jay in San Diego,"Bought these thinking they would be good for nighttime boating. There were not. I found them difficult to use, and do not have any long range focus, and don't add much more visually to the night view than you can see by yourself. I sent them back for a full refund."
5,the Turgid Miasma of Paris in the Springtime,"John Lydon cursing the audience, the audience responding with hoots and catcalls; Jah Wobble and Keith Levine screwing aroundin between songs--the hate is palpable. The songs and action is standard PIL, rickety and dour, the recording starting and ending abruptly; sound quality is very good. Not a place to start listening to PIL,but considerably better than ""Live In Tokyo"", the sound and performance of which makes me think of HBO specials and Las Vegas acts."
5,Where can I find this?!,"I hear this album constantly on Pandora and I can't find it to buy it anywhere. I feel as though I'm pretty tech savvy but this album has evaded me for at least 6 months. Any help? If you find a link where I can buy it, please post it. Thanks :)"
5,Email the Company to Request they put this back in print!,"Like the other reviewers, I was introduced to this on Pandora and started looking for a copy to buy. Looking up the recording label information on Amazon, I went online to the company. For the product listing for Relax With...Living in Harmony, it says the item is no longer available. HOWEVER, they offer a link to give them your email if/when the item is available again.[...]If my posted link doesn't work, just goog the Bci / Eclipse Music label and you should be able to search for the album title on their site.I hope they re-release! This music is truly captivating yet relaxing."
1,dont waste money,"paid, tried and nothing, waste of money. maybe you will have better luck, the product is legit and new, but it did not work for me, the phone does not recognize it, even though nokia website states it is compatible."
4,finally something worked!,I bought 2 off brand cables first and neither worked. Very frustrated I finally bought the more expensive Nokia cable and (horray!) it worked!The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is overpriced.
3,"High quality product, but...","...there has to be a better way of communicating with one's Nokia cell phone than this! I believe a Blue Tooth USB device for the computer would be a much better option, although I cannot vouch for the reliability of Blue Tooth vs the USB/Serial cable.A great product, but in my opinion quite over-priced."
4,I don't know I liked it.,"I read this book when it was a up and coming local author pick in the local d.c gay book store and i liked it then. It's a lesbian romance adventure story of survivors of a biological war and sickeness that wipes out society 20 years ago.where three woman find each other and make the perfect threesome relationship. the authors creates a magical place were social normals are disfuntional and disfuntional is the norm and common place and possable. here in this story everyone in the 3 are fine with the threesome, no jealousy, the lovers all felt equal.the story goes on to be filled with amazing fight scenes. Crazy pro-creationists, escapes, adventures gREAT love scenes. I really liked the story telling here. the author really creates a world.The Three with a well-paced plot that never slows. She excels at giving us an astounding tale that is tightly written and extremely sensual. I highly recommend this unique book."
4,good read,very different story line altogether. its not one of her best works but its still a good read. I enjoyed it
2,Surprisingly disappointed,"Am a big fan of Meghan O'Brien's books, but I have to say that I was slightly disappointed with this book. Probably because it was very different to the light-hearted nature of a lot of her other books, but I did feel it dragged on quite a bit.Perhaps I found it difficult to relate the circumstances within this book, but to me, it was a little too far-fetched a storyline.Despite feeling disappointed with this title, I still highly recommend Meghan O'Brien's books to all!"
2,Pooh,I really didn't care for this book. The premise of the end of the world was enticing but the 'threesome' factor was over the top for me. I truly hate to be negative about any writer of lesbian fiction but this author has too much talent to waste it on detailing all the permutations of a triangle of lesbian sex.To be fair the summary stated the threesome factor but I bought it anyway hoping the 'end of the world' portion would prevail.Save your money and read Kim Baldwin's Hunter's Pursuit instead (or any Karin Kallmaker novel.)**Remember - if you want your favorite authors to keep writing for us they have to be able to earn a living doing it. Always buy a NEW book. I know it sucks but if you're not going to keep it in your collection recycle it.**
3,Pleasing in Several Ways,"Andrew Bird's violin gives a new dimension (generally a dark one) to 30's/40's era swing music. He also knows how to turn a phrase in unexpected ways. However, a whole album's worth tends to get pretty same-y sounding, especially one of this length. I found that I like it best as background music rather than intently listening (one friend asked me if I was listening to ""that Motel 6 commerical""). That's a shame, since obviously a lot of thought went into it. However, my opinion is just that - perhaps you'll really dig it."
2,"Andrew Bird, Oh the Grandeur","If you bought and really enjoyed Thrills, then Granduer will seem less exciting, and probably a little mundane. While the album is strong it lacks the sicerity displayed in the debut album. Friend of Squirrel Nut Zippers, Andrew Bird's violin screeches almost become annoying on this release, where they were welcomed on Thrills. It seems Mr. Bird tried to accomplish too much in too little time. We don't mind a return to the good old jazz, but this album lacks the ""Grandeur""."
5,AWESOME DEAL FOR THE MONEY,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON FOR X-MAS & HE LOVES IT!! WHAT A DEAL TO GET THE SCOOTER, HELMET & PADS! I PRICED THEM SEPARATELY & COULD NOT PASS THIS UP. NOT TO MENTION SPIDER MAN IS HIS FAVORITE!"
5,perfect,"i use this flat iron almost everyday and it works great for me. i have thick, wavy hair and i can't stand it. i always like my hair straight and thin, and this product does just that. it thins and straightens my hair. i have been using it for about a year and i have no regrets so far.THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT"
1,don't get this...,"alright, i think i'm cursed or something. the day after i wrote my review, guess what happened?! the straightener started sparking at me and now the plates don't heat up. it usually takes about 30-45 minutes to straighten my hair, and i was almost done when this happened. it took another 30 mintues to finish. i have since bought a vidal sassoon vs190c professional straightener. it has 20 heat settings, 170 watts (all the same as this one), and the plates wrap around the edges so the roots can get straightened. i recommend that straightener above this one."
2,Wouldn't have bought it with my own money.,"I have extremely curly and thick hair, down to about my shoulders. My friend gave me this straightener last year because she had 2. At first, it worked pretty well, but soon my hair started getting caught in the corners of the plates and ripping out. Also, it makes the ends of my hair look REALLY damaged, like I have all split ends, and it makes them feel like hay. The top my hair looks pretty good, but I would not replace this straightener if it broke."
4,Surprise!,"Oh my goodness, i just got this yesterday and it works! I have very course hair for my age, and textureizing it only worked for 2 days. I used the conair brand, were you change the plates on it, but it doesnt work! Last night i turned it on and i did one straight out and oh my it was straight out STRAIGHT!I especially reccomend this for people who have course hair like me."
4,"Works well, but can pull hair out","This is the first hair straightener I have ever bought and it works really well. It has such a large range of temperature settings that it straightens without giving that fried look. But, recently mine has been tearing out strands of hair. Hair gets caught between the metal and the plastic, especially at the top corners...and ouch! I think using it a lot created a gap between the metal and the plastic. It helps to pull your hair taut and then running the straightener down, avoiding corners."
5,I love it!!,I am lucky enough to have the thickest and coarsest and waviest/curliest hair in North Carolina. Then I found this straightner. I have had my straightener for about 8 months and it still works so well. I also had a salon brand straightner by Hot Tools that I bought for 100 dollars and this 20 dollar straightner works just as well as that one did. I love it. There is no way taht you can expect it to be perfect since it is only 20 bucks but I believe that if you had it for 3 months then you got your monies worth. Or maybe I just have better luck then everyone. God Bless
4,Good Product,"I have had the straightener about 5 months now, and use it about twice per week. I have not had any major problems with it, and am pleased the the results. To prevent snagging your hair, don't try to do too much hair at one time and go slowly. Even with these precautions, there are occasional hair catches. But in my opinion, this is very minor compared to the great benefits the product provides - smooth, straight hair. (Better results than I've ever been able to achieve with the hair dryer.) It's a great product for women with curly hair to be able to get smooth, elegant-looking hair without having to go to the salon."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This was the first flat iron I ever owned. It worked ok, but it pulled my hair. That hurt! I have thick hair and it takes a while to straighten it. Friends were telling me Chi was the best. Well, I finally bought one. What a difference! Yes, the Chi is over $100, but it's the best! I got my hair done in half the time the Revlon one took. Plus, the Chi heated up in one minute and did not pull my hair. The Chi gets my hair straighter, faster. And my hair feels so silky after using the Chi."
3,not bad,This straightener is a lot better than the thin conair one i previously bought. It does heat up in 60 secs and is able tyo smoothe out my thick wavy hair. It's a good straightener for the price so i would recommended it. It's gold plated but not ceramic.
3,an OK straightener-but I've found a new god of straightening,"Ok I had this straightener a couple of years ago andit was ok, but I had the usual light-stopped-going-on and didn't-heat-up problems! I HIGHLY recommend you cough up 10 extra bucks and get a Helen of Troy. It works wonderfully. I've had it for 3 years and it's still kickin'! You want to get the Helen of Troy straightener of her gold series and also make sure it has a dial to control the heat.(ranges 1-10) This straighter get super hot so if you hair is super dry and fragile like mine you wanna put something on the ends to protect it from the heat!"
5,Great Straightener,"This straightener has lasted me 6 years and counting, it was my first and only straightener when I was 12. I will probably be buying a new one soon just because the plates are starting to wear down due to everyday use but this product is great. I have normal, wavy, color treated hair and this product does the job, I recommend it to anyone with pretty manageable hair that would like to take about 10 minutes to get shiny perfectly straight hair."
2,Great the first time around,"Unlike all the other posters, I had this straightener for years. Loved it! I have very thick, wavey hair and it straightened it in no time. Didn't rip out my hair, I loved it. So, when it finally did break (the outside cracked) I decided to look it up online to see if I could find it. Ordered another one off of Amazon. The first one I got started smoking as soon as I turned it on and gave off a horrible smell. It also ripped my hair out because the plates stuck out from the housing. I emailed the company and they were great, sent me out a new one and told me to throw that one away. I now have another one and it also gives off a terrible smell. A real shame because I loved my original one..maybe I got lucky the first time around."
2,WISH IT DIDNT KEEP BREAKING!,"I do love this straightener - the plates are big and it heats up quickly, yet I use it everyday and after about 2 months, the light stops going on, which means the plates will not go on. Not to mention the cord continually curls up so bad you have to yank it to get it to your head (or spend 5 minutes trying to uncurl the cord). I have bought it twice, and today it broke again. I have a feeling that Revlon will tell me that it's gone through ""extreme wear"" -- it should at least be able to handle everyday usage! I'm going to have to buy a different brand, and I recommend you find a different one also, one without all of these hassles."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My friends have used this straightener and they say it works good, until it breaks, also this straightener snags the hair to much,plus say hi to damage, split ends, and fried hair."
1,You get what pay for,Cheap product in all means. It riped off my hair while straightening and did a very lousy job
1,AWFULL,ok well this was the first straightener thati ever bought and it workerd well.. for the first 3 months then it broke so i bought the same on again but then that one broke almost immdeiatly... i would recommend the conair sissors sorta one.... i forget what its called but also the wet 2 dry one it works wonders and doesn't even damage my hair<br />
1,Don't buy it!,I have had this straightner for a while...My friend reccomended it to me. I loved it and even read reviews about it before thinking nothing of them and thought I just got lucky with mine.It's Christmas and I was just in the process of doing my hair when it just turned off...It was working fine the entire time and it just stopped. It did come back on for a second...sort of like it was shorting but now it wont come back on. I have half frizzy hair and half straight hair now and nothing I can do about it...So now I get to figure out a way to fix this since I can't just run out and get a new straightner...*runs off to continue looking for her old crappy conair one (another crappy brand)*
4,When all else fails...,"I unwillingly own the thickest most wavy hair in NC. And my hair is long too, which does not help much at all. I have tried Conair's hair straightner. Worked for five minutes, then my hair became moderately frizzy. Another hair straightner by some pathetic company did not heat up enough to do anything useful. During my trip to Beale afb, my cousin begged me to let her straighten my ""horse hair"" with her straightner. Not hard to guess what it was... 30 min later my hair was straight and smooth and easier to manage. (Too bad she had to take it on her trip to Utah...)Downfall...I was missing a 10 strands of hair."
2,RUN AWAY! QUICK!,"I had this straightener for about three monthes before one day, when i see inside the straightener, there are little sparks going off and it smells different, like fire perhaps? Now I'm not an expert, but i knew something was wrong when that started happening so i quickly turned it off. The next day, i wanted to try it but the same thing happened and then suddenly the light went off and it just wouldn't work anymore. It completely burned out. This is a horrible straightener. It also pulls your hair out. If you want a good straightener, I'm afraid you might have to pay a bit more, but it's worth it. The best kinds are Ceramic Tools or Hot Tools and i recommend a ceramic one because its a lot better for your hair. Whatever you do, don't get Conair or Revlon. A good straightener is probably going to cost you over 30 dollars, but you'll be a lot happier, trust me."
2,Worked perfect...for a while,"This is the first straightening iron that I have ever had. One day, it just stopped working. I tried and tried to get it too start working again...but I couldnt. I was so happy with it and it just broke down on me. What it does is the light flickers and it stops heating up. My advice is to buy a slightly more expensive one, and it will be worth it because you can count on it. I mean, it worked great, but after a while it stopped and its a waste of money!!!"
5,Beautiful . . . but lacking,"I give this album 5 stars because I think what's there deserves them. I do wonder, however, at the choices that were made--which songs to put in, which to leave out. I suppose the most satisfying thing would be to have another album made with more of JRB's songs--particularly from Songs and L5Y. I love Parade, but it's not as ""singable."" In any event, don't let the lack of some great songs keep you from buying this album. The tracks are perfect to sing to--and I'm quite picky! My faves: Stars and the Moon, Climbing Uphill, The Next Ten Minutes, If I Didn't Believe in You--oh, scratch it all! They're all brilliant! BUY IT!"
4,SEALs are soooo sexy!,"I loved this book, as well as every other book in the series. I think navy SEALs, as romance characters, are so sexy. I especially loved the return of all the previous characters. The only problem I had was that there wasn't enough of Joe and Victoria Catalonotto, but other than that, it's a must read."
4,sultry sounds,"A lovely, groovy (southern) summer soundtrack. Plenty of variety but consistently good quality. Recommended."
5,The BEST of the Brasil-Electro Samplers!!!,"I can't believe the negative reviews below! This is the BEST CD sampler of ELECTRONICA BASS-A-NOVA that I've come across. Purists should look elsewhere. (Just because you happen to like Bo Diddley, doesn't mean you can't love They Might Be Giants or Radiohead too.) I, too, have over 100 Brasilian albums & CDs, but I still love this. I've had it for several years and it's a great introduction to a variety of new artists from Brasil including Lenine, Zuco 103, Smoke City, Suba, Arnaldo Antunes, Arto Lindsay, and Fernanda Abreu. It's full of modern electronica innovations, creativity, and rhythms. It's fantastic!"
2,For American twenty-somethings,"A relentlessly trendoid pastiche intended for the North American kewl market. It cobbles together the offerings of many fine and varied artists, but the association implies that there is a ""new thing"" here - in the sense of the original bossa nova or tropicalia, which isn't the case. Rather being something new, it is an example of unassimilated influences. Some North American influences have been ""eaten,"" perhaps especially by artists connected with Bahia, but that's not really on the table here. Virginia Rodrigues career has been stalled from day one because she is essentially unable to use her great voice - she simply can't move her butt stylistically - thus, her inclusion here is a bit of unintentional irony. Brasil has a tremendously complex folk and pop musical reservoir and a sophisticated modern music industry - this stuff is definitely not the sharpest tooth of the cutting edge."
1,Garbage,"I own over 100 Brazilian CDs and this is simply the worst of the lot. I should have known when I saw Bebel Gilberto included. This is simply a collection of Brazilian musicians who are ashamed to be Brazilian and have to incorporate this electronic garbage from North AMerica into their music. If you are new to Brazilian music, don't even consider this CD. Look for a collection of samba, axé, forró or something truly Brazilian."
2,"Real disappointed, passed on item","I am looking to buy a MP3-CD capable boombox with good sound. I lastbought a CD boombox in 1995. At that time the one that sounded thebest to me was a JVC, so I lookead at this one first. I have learnedthat I rarely put in more than one CD, so multi-changers are unneededcomplexity as far as I'm concerned. The first thing I noticed is that when you open the CD tray, it completely blocks your view of every button! What idiot thought that up? The second thing was the incredibly gaudy display. I like having the artist & title displayed, but I HATE the insanely bright moving displays. I wish the Japanese would figure out that grownups buy this stuff, not just preteens. The unit sounded great, but after I looked at the manual and realized you can't turn off the frequency/volume graphical displays, leaving the artist/title info, I had to pass on the item. Not only that, but the speakers don't attach anymore. Sheesh."
1,Boring!!!,UHHH TNA is Just a clone of WCW in 2000 and 2001 you can say this is a 3hr snooze fest right here ...
3,decent ppv,all i can say iss that it was a mid level show with a couple good matches if you can get this used cheaply i say buy it you'll be entertained enough to justify it
1,Not again.,Why do people keep trying to make Home Alone keep going on? The 1st and 2nd one were great to see but now why more Home Alone. Not the same kid who play in Home Alone 1 and 2. I see the 3th one and hate it. It was not good at all. Why keep Home Alone going? It is time to stop the the Home Alone.
4,Lots of training info but not much technique,"Lots and lots of information if you're planning your season's training or you're coaching a team. There are drills for all the strokes, explanations of training zones, example workouts, and information on all aspects of swimming competitively (starts, turns, tactics, tapering,...).What this book doesn't have, which is reflected in the title, is in depth descriptions of the intricacies of the strokes. If you want lots of that, choose another book. If you know how the strokes are performed but want some guidance on your training, this would be a good addition to your library."
5,One fabulous tour of Sinatra's life.,"All I can say is buy it and read it! Clear, consise and factual review of his life. The best yet."
4,Good Book for F. Sinatra Info.,I am 75% through this book and so far it has been a wealth of knowledge. I can't say that it is all fact because each story carries testimonies from different people. However the book gives youa good idea on the type of man he was. His greatness and his faults.
2,"Alright book, but too sleezy!","The book is written well. Its full of nice photos. However, there is far too much curse words, and attention on his sexual life, thus making the book into a 500+ page tabloid! Sinatra is a man of music, but lets not forget he was a brilliant actor as well. The book hardly focuses on that aspect of his career (the films) Instead, the author devotes much of his energy focusing into Franks love life, which I don't think should be looked too deeply. Why, because you or anybody else (including the author) would want his/her love life on the spotlight. The book would have been alot better if the author devoted his energy on taking out the sleezy jazz, and concentrate more on his films."
5,Only socks i'll wear,Bar none these socks are all i will wear. As far as running in them goes... im sure they'd be great but i love them for everyday use.
4,A little cool,"If you like your Haydn brisk, this CD is for you. I like a little more warmth with the gorgeous Haydn melodies stretched just a little bit. The performances here certainly have excitement but it is not really my type of Haydn."
2,Too fast by far,"Previous reviewers have attested to the excellent sound on this CD. I concur: it is outstanding. So is the orchestral playing.In other respects I disagree with those reviewers' raves.The CD's annotator notes that Mackerras's recordings of the two symphonies are among ""the fastest on recordings."" That is true. The allegro of the Military's 1st movement is taken at a presto clip that leaves one breathless -- or, better, gives one not a second to savor a moment before another moment comes cascading in.I have about a dozen recordings of each of these works. I've listened to Mackerras's four times; I doubt I'll listen to them ever again."
2,"lots of info, bad organization","this book has a lot of info, but is not organzied very well.e.g chapter 11 ""key visual studio .net benefits"" would require you to build the following chapters 3,4,5,7,8,54,55,57,73,76,79.it gives a general idea, but not fully working examples where the reader can type and run,"
5,Virtuoso to the Extreme!,Mussorgsky's revolutionary music comes brilliantly alive in what has to be the most intense recording of PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION available. The orchestrated version is performed with feeling and energy rarely heard. The final two movements especially evoke terror and grandeur with an outstanding wind section and the best timpani performance I have ever heard. A triumph of a recording of the music of a great but misunderstood genius.
4,"Does the job, seems reliable.","I bought this for a client to replace a D-Link that had a port failure. I've been mostly happy with Netgear products' reliability. I used their smartswitches in corporate environments and they seem bulletproof, though too expensive for home office environments. This was an expansion of port count and a replacement for a home office that is accessed extensively from the field, and has to be reliable and high-performing, but on a budget. This switch seems to meet these needs. We have yet to try the more sophisticated functions, but plan to explore those when my client has time to work with me on that setup."
4,"Many features, works as intended","No complaints - wide range of features, setup was simple.(disclaimer: I'm a tech geek, though I think the basic features wouldn't require much specialized knowledge to get working.)"
5,Great starter kit !!,I was impressed by the quality and durability of this product. It's a great set for the beginner cake decorater. I've been baking for years and decided I wanted to get a little fancier with the decorating and I couldn't have found a better product. I'll definately keep buying products from this maker.
1,Boring,"I am an activist, and I love that my homeschooled teen is getting into it as well. However, this book was boring and poorly written. You are better off getting some of the Scholastic magazines and books instead."
5,It's worth buying and trying.,"We have a barn with 9 horse stalls and we clean the stalls daily. The flies were becoming a large problem and we can't afford to use a fly spray system. We tried another kind of fly bait that you sprinkle into pans (we used old disposable aluminum pie plates.) The attractant didn't work very well. We had heard about the Quick Bayt Fly Bait from a friend who raises over 10,000 turkeys and swears by it. We couldn't find Quick Bayt Fly Bait in the stores in our part of TX so we ordered over the internet. We haven't found anything that works better...but you have to give it a couple of weeks to do the job. The product doesn't cost an arm and a leg...so we are very pleased with the results...dead flies and a noticably reduced fly population."
3,Fly Bait,"Received product timely. Red granular product tends to stain area where distributed when it comes in contact with water. Flies were not necessarily attracted to it, but when placed around a fly attractant, the flies would eat and die within 90 seconds. I used this bait in conjunction with a fly trap."
2,minimal effect,I bought this fly killer because of all the positive reviews but after trying it i wonder why? Ive had better luck with the super stinky fly traps. Fly's just did not seem attracted to this bait for some reason.
2,not what I expected,"I was hoping to reduce my fly population - not provide a meeting place for flies! Sure, it is lethal, but it doesn't entice the flies to taste. The flies are attracted by the attractant and then they hang around and swap phone numbers. Very few of the cloud of flies that were attracted to the site actually tasted the poison. Sticky traps work just as well, and I don't have to worry about secondary poisoning."
5,Works great,I spread it out very thinly in the feed barn on top of an empty feed sack & throw it away once it becomes full of dead flies
5,Simply Perfect,"This set, like the music played, is simply perfect. Every instrument in the orcehstra can be heard as a distinct voice -- this is partly a function of the wonderful sound quality on these discs, but more importantly it's a function of the razor sharp playing of the performers. And Mackerras makes the music dance and sing and soar like (I believe) Mozart's music always should. Everything about this set is just right. I've compared it carefully to Pinnok/English Concert and to ter Linden/Mozart Akademie, Amsterdam (both also excellent) and the Mackerras set is just that much better in every way. Listening to these performances is like listening to this glorious music for the very first time, and you couldn't possibly wish for a better treat than that. I can't recommend this set highly enough."
5,Excellent service,"My CDs arrived way before it was supposed to, and it was in excellnet condition as promise."
3,"Good, but . . .","I bought this item from Amazon and I am not sorry that I did. Actually it is good, very good, but I find something that I do not like: Why does this Sir McKerras play all the minuets so fast? Why does he such excessive repeating? The minuets in Haydn are all happy and full of joy, but in Mozart each one is quite different from another: some are happy, some are sad, some are childish, some are majestic, etc. Some of those Minuets seem to be written in order to be danced by Kings and so forth. Is Sir McKerras such an egalitarian that he does not accept such differences? Too bad Herr Josef Krips is dead, he was the real Mozartean."
2,this is why models have management,"Like many models getting started in the business, I didn't know which way to turn. The hardest part is to qualify clients and to only work with those that will keep the image of you that you would like to promote in the market place. This book really doesn't outline this aspect of the industry. Good management is what got me a blossoming career in this business. Thanks to Digital White Boy Management, http://www.digitalwhiteboy.com , I've made it in this industry."
2,not the best elevated food bowls,"I had this model for my great danes. The tray on top gathered a lot of pet hair and food crumbs and needed to be cleaned often. The grossest part was under the bowls. Slobbery water will spill under the water bowl and you will have to clean it daily or it will get really gross. Don't fill the legs with water (it says to use either water or sand) because the legs are easy to come off and you don't want the water to spill on the floor. I guess you wouldn't want to spill sand either :) It's not a big issue until you need to move it. Overall, I'd recommend getting the heavy wire ones with the rubber stoppers on the feet. That has worked the best for my dogs."
5,Great Feeder,My German Shepherd is not quite a year old and this was exactly the right size for him. We added some litter into the legs to weight them down as it suggested in the instructions and it hasn't moved once. Easy to fill and clean as the metal bowls come out and of course it is really good for the dog.
1,Cheap-Don't waste you money!,"Most useless item I have ever bought. Not sturdy at all, poorly made.The price draws you in but don't waste your money. Neither dogs will drink out of it due to the instability and the bowls well that is a whole nother story. who in their right mind puts round bottomed mixing bowl type bowls to use for water for an animal.Spend a little more and get something else."
3,Cheap,The overall product would be great except the legs do not fit properly so it is wobbly. Their resolution is to rotate the legs hoping they will fit in a different place. That didn't work.
5,Bumpy but happy reunion,"College lovers Caitlin Calloway and Jamie Jameson's relationship ended one day after a passionate lover making session.12 years later Dr. Jameson meets Detective Calloway at the hospital she's working. Jamie hates CC for running out on her 12 years ago. CC wants to get back together again.But a folly of misunderstandings and interruptions keep them from sealing the deal. There's a serial killer on the loose and he's killing women who look like Jamie.There's lots or romance and mystery. At one point when I was reading, I wanted to say ""Ladies chill so we can catch the killer""."
5,Mavis Hits A Homerun !!!!!,I have been a fan of Mavis' stories since I first discovered them on the net. This is a story of mystery and romance. At a time when we all need a little escapism Mavis entertains and enthralls us with this wonderfully entertaining read. You WILL fall in love with this story and it's wonderfully funny and romantic characters. Please reach for this Brass Ring before it's too late.
4,Fun to watch comedy,A great David Niven comedy. If you like those 60s cops and robbers comedies like the Pink Panther you will probably enjoy this.
2,A very dated slice of the 60s,"Inept late 60s slapstick which brings out the worst in the four stars - Belmondo, Niven, Bourvil and Eli Wallach. More interesting for the cars than the inane plot and cardboard effects. Apparently it was supposed to be a take off on then-popular heist films. It succeeds on almost no front."
5,Fantastic!!,"I have owned this hair dryer for as long as I can remember, and absolutely LOVE it!! It is very quiet, and has a cool shot button, which is great. It also has the removable lint trap, which makes it easy to clean. I would recommend this to everyone - especially those that would like a hair dryer without the noise, but with all the power!"
1,Electrical Short Problem,"My family has used this model hairdryer for about 11 months. While it was being used recently the wiring in the handle shorted and flames and smoke started escaping from the off / on switch. My wife burnt her finger and dropped it to the floor then unplugged it. Upon examination of the handle, the wires at the solder points in the handle had shorted and caught on fire. I know the dryer was not being misused or over heated, so it appears to be a manufacturers defect. Buyers need to be aware of this potential problem."
5,Excelent book!!,"Great book! Very comprehensive, with plenty of pictures and covering a wide variety of subjects of the wolf's life. For me, it's the ultimate guide for this species."
1,Do Not Buy This TV!,"The bulb burned out in less than two months! Toshiba doesn't have any replacements in stock and they are not sure when their next shipment is coming in!? Did these people ever hear of tracking information? It's a great tv if you remove the front screen and host puppet shows inside. Very roomy. But if you want to actually watch tv, this product can't help you. Toshiba's customer service line is one of those that makes you key your phone number, zip code and favorite color into the phone before someone answers, then, when someone finally does answer they ask for your phone number, zip code and favorite color! Didn't I just do this? Didn't I just do this?TV still doesn't work..."
4,"Great TV, Bad bulb","I also purchased this toshiba dlp tv on black friday from best buy. What a deal i thought. Great piture with the hdmi input and an upconverted dvd at 1081i. And an even better picture with the built in hd tuner. I always wandered if the deal was too good to be true, and well, now in march the bulb on my set has now gone out too. It looks like mine made it longer than some, but i still didn't make it to the 4 month mark. I have just started the process of trying to get a replacement bulb, so we will see how long it takes. Overall, I loved the tv.... while it had picture."
2,Buyer Beware....Do Your Homework!,"The good: The TV is light as a feather. The picture is awesome, and can be viewed from all angles with no substantive loss of picture quality.The bad: The bulb. My bulb blew exactly 2 mo. after purchase. Toshiba states that the ""average"" bulb life is 6000-8000 hours. Look around the 'net and you will see that the ""average"" bulb life is substantially shorter.There is no reason that a $2K TV should be rendered useless after 2 mo because of a blown bulb. There is a defect either with the bulbs or the TVs themselves.Oh, by the way, the bulbs are ALWAYS on backorder. We are currently looking at a downtime of about 20 days (IF...and that is a big IF...the bulb comes in when they say it is supposed to). And if you can find the bulbs, expect to shell out about $400 for a new one. In other words, the hidden cost of ownership for this item is ridiculous."
3,Good TV but be ready to buy replacement lamps,"I bought this television in 2005 it has great picture quality and is extremely light weight for it's size. I was however very glad I bought the 5 year warranty because I have had the lamp replaced at least five times and it was covered under the warranty. The lamps used to sell for around $250.00, however they are now available for around $100. Still less than a total television replacement."
1,Cut Your Losses,I bought this TV and had the bulb replaced within a few months. Thought everything was fine now 1 year later after warranty ran out the picture engine has gone out that is another 500.00 or more to replace. I am going to throw away this set it is not worth any more money. Good luck to other owners.
1,great picture....the 35% of time it works!,"I bought this TV on Black Friday in '05 and got an awesome deal, so I thought. Little did I know that only two months later, the nightmare with Toshiba would begin. I'm currently (4/07) working on getting rid of the second one of these TVs, b/c the first one had to be replaced with the second hunk of junk I'm working on getting rid of now. I've spent countless hours fighting with Toshiba about them sending me a new lamp unit, then getting the TV serviced, then getting the TV swaped for new one, then getting a new lamp unit, then getting it serviced, then getting it serviced again, . . . you get it. This is BY FAR the worst experience I've had with a company and the biggest waste of time and money. I will NEVER buy a Toshiba product again and strongly discourage you from doing so either."
1,Great Picture......while it lasts,"I have had this television since nov of '05. I replaced my first lamp after about 2 months. The second bulb lasted a year (hooray) but these bulbs cost $300 a piece. Not good. Please, do your research, and do not buy this televison. I regret it everyday."
2,THREE BULBS IN SEVEN MONTHS,"There's no use talking of any other features about this TV if you can't watch it because of a light bulb! If it is the bulb causing our screen to blank out and have 4 service calls, I DREAD when our 'extended warranty' runs out. ('extended warranty': We'll replace the $$$ bulbs until your warranty runs out, then it's in your court, sucker). If Toshiba is as the reviews here say, then it is not the store we all bought the TVs at...even the tech told me that Toshiba is not easy to deal with and they have to 'authorize' every miniscule thing that is ordered or done! Well, at this rate, our warranty WILL run out and we'll be stuck with buying $$$ bulbs. The only glimmer of hope I read about here is the different company that Toshiba is getting the bulbs from. That is the least of their worries, though, if their customer service is that terrible. Fool us once, shame on you, fool us twice....no way!"
5,DIRECTV Samsung FlipTop Flat Panel TV,"I was looking for a small kitchen set and this one is just what I was looking for. It's small, tucks up under when not in use, has a great picture and sound!"
3,DS Lite Replacement Battery kit,The screw driver that was included was the wrong size for the screws on the back of the DS. The actual size is much smaller than the screw driver. Luckily we had a eyeglass repair screw driver that was the right size.
5,DS LITE BATTERY REPLACEMENT,Received this item in record time to Hawaii! It even came with screwdriver! Perfect and my DS is working fine! Yippee! Mahalo and much Aloha!
3,replacement battery,"Only ordered a replacement battery for DS Lite. The battery works well, just doesn't seem to hold a charge as long as an original battery."
1,Incorrect EMAIL,"Hi, I have tried to find another way to let you know that the person who purchased the DS Battery Lite is not me. Arlyn Hatch must have given an incorrect email address because that is not me and I did not make this purchase. I apologize and I hope this can be corrected so that I don't continue to get emails about other purchases this customer makes."
2,Not useful at all.,I waste my money. This is a useless product. You need not to waste your money behind this kind of product. I am not recommonding this product to any one.
4,Works Well,"Very nice, I use it a lot.Only negative comment is that the screwdriver did not fit my DS Lite's battery compartment screw."
3,Like others said the fit is tight,"I originally purchased this product because I thought there was a problem with my original DS battery. It turns out I had to send my DS lite in for repair, to Nintendo (which by the way was a plesant experience 5 STARS!!!).Like others have stated, this battery is a little tight but it will fit. I have never run it down to empty so I don't have an opinon on the battery life.I have a Gloss Black DS Lite. Oh and yes I paid like $2.00 for it on Amazon. I am giving it three stars because of the snug fit."
4,Battery Swap,"These days, with so many customers ourchasing the Nintendo DS Lite, many are just wearing the life out of their batteries out. For Intec, they have developed a convient battery for you to use. Their Nintendo DS Lite battery is simple to use, and easy to install. You could use this for longer periods of time, while playing your favorite Nintendo DS games like New Super Mario Brothers, and many more. While you could get Nintendo's battery only through their online store, at a more expensive price, Intec's battery works just as well. I absolutely recommend it a whole lot.Price: B+Convience: BOverall: B 1/2+"
1,Screwdriver sucks,The screwdriver provided doesn't actually open the compartment! And then the battery still didn't work when I managed to pry the compartment open (although I am not sure if that is the fault of the DS or the battery). I would not buy this at all.
5,Still out in front ..,"Fifteen years after it was first published, this remains a seminal work regarding contemporary architecture .. in particular the problem, in large metropolitan projects, of accommodating both the client and the site without simply piling up glass boxes."
1,"Bad product, horrible customer service","Bought this item for light use and it turns out not to work well at all, even for basic use - if you walk around you get all kinds of feedback, the cord that attaches the mic to the unit is cheap and any time it bends it cuts out, the unit didn't come with a lavalier mic clip as it shows it would, I've contacted customer service four times now to get the mic clip (a $.02 cheap plastic piece, I'm assuming), and they have said they would send it out every time I've called but I have never received a thing (it has been several weeks). Even sent customer service an e-mail but never received any response back from them (over a week ago). I would NEVER buy anything from Nady again - don't waste your money. Spend a little bit more and go with another brand."
4,Incredible performance and sound,"I tend to agree with the issues some critics have raised with these interpretations; Levi and company miss the mark. The four stars is for the amazing playing he elicits from the Atlanta S.O. and the sound that Telarc provides. This disc has remained one of my favorites to listen to since I bought it and I think credit should always be given when it's due. However, if Levi had let the music flow a little more this could have been one of the greatest recordings in the Sibelius catalog. As it is, he tends to clip phrases in a way that limits the expressiveness of the music. For example, compare the opening of En Saga with those by Gibson, Sakari, Jarvi or others; or, for that matter, the first movement of the Karelia suite. Still, I think Finlandia benefits from this approach and is given one of it's most powerful performances. All in all, a missed opportunity but still very much worth listening to."
4,The Bumble Rumble Rulz!,"Once I played this CD, I couldn't get the songs out of my head! One song in particular was The Bumble Rumble. It is the coolest little jazz ditty. Not only will the kids like it, but adults will find some of the songs irresistable, too!"
3,"OK, but not the best","I bought this iron when my sister took my other one to college. I don't really like that you must unplug the whole unit to turn it off, or that there isn't a level of heat adjustment. It is OK, but it takes a long time to make my hair totally straight. It doesn't ever get perfectly straight because my hair is naturally very curly and I live in a high humidity area, but it seemed to do an average job. I am buying another straightening iron through Target today, and I kind of hope it works a little better."
1,Did not work,Does not get very hot and takes forever to straighten hair. I have very fine hair and usually it takes no time at all - this took forever and didn't completely straighten.
1,Disappointed,i love Vidal Sasson i have never used anything else but when my Straightener broke this was the only one like it..i was not impressed this works nothing like my old one it does not have a good grip for my hair and it burns
3,Similiar model - Okay for the price,"I can't find my model on here and there aren't very many reviews so I am writing a review for a similiar model, the Vidal Sassoon VS195 ceramic. It has three heat settings and the plates seem to heat independently, and it is more effective than two other flat irons I have tried in the same price range, but it doesn't work great for my curly, coarse, damaged hair. It leaves it poofy and frizzy and takes the curl out but it is still wavy, not stick straight. Probably okay for naturally straighter or thinner hair but those of us who aren't so blessed would be better off with a more expensive iron."
1,Very Disappointed,"Bought these, tried giving my rabbit these on multiple days, he did not even nibble a single one. He hates them. :("
4,Looks good for procedurally-oriented people,I thumbed through this book in a bookstore yesterday. It looks as if it would be very helpful to people who think procedurally and like a book to be organized into a set of procedures for doing specific tasks. For others I recommend David Pogue's book Windows Vista: The Missing Manual. This is a superb book that always answered the questions that the other four Vista books I bought all failed to answer.Windows Vista: The Missing Manual
3,"Title should be ""On Literary Criticism""","Eudora Welty was an icon of twentieth century literature. Her work reprinted here is straight out of my literary criticism classes of the sixties. All essays were originally published in the sixties and seventies. This book is useful for the student of literary criticism. It is NOT useful for the student of writing technique, characterization, short stories, plot development, use of place and time."
5,great insights,"If you are a writer, or a lover of literature and literary writing, American in particular, Southern American even more so, this will be a pleasure."
3,Nothing New for Me,"Maybe when this book came out it offered useful information, but I found little that I could use. I'm not a writing scholar, but I've read a few books on the subject and by the time I read this one I found nothing new of use."
1,Very Poorly Made,"By the time you pay for shipping, this is a very expensive cup. The bottom was uneven--a full 1/4"" taller on one side than the other. The lip of the cup was poorly sanded and could possibly cause pain. The sides are not sanded well either. Poor QA and overall very poor quality."
3,Not much mech combat,"Focuses more on the politics of the dark age, spies and terrorists, that sort of thing. still a decent book though."
2,OK action but pretty shallow,Not a bad book but not memorable. Pretty predictable with shallow stereotypical characters. I enjoyed some of the larger implications of the attacks on the galactic communication grid but felt that the author left that aspect a bit unexplored to focus on the one conflict.
5,Ghost War was a great book.,I enjoyed the writers style. Narating the story completely through the eyes of the story's main character was fresh for me. I don't remember ever reading another book that did that. Stackpole kept the story moving forward quite nicely from start to finish. I look forward to reading more of Stackpoles work.
4,"Good, but not Stackpole's best...","I actually give this book about a 3.5... The only flaw with this intriguing introduction to the Dark Age of the Inner Sphere is that, at times, things seem to work out a little too well for the protagonist, Mason Dunne. Most of the time, his plans go exactly as he wants them to go. Also, if he is ever beaten, he just shrugs the bruises off and goes about his life the next day like nothing happened at all. If this doesn't deter a reader, then this novel is worth a chance. Fans of the Battletech series and the Dark Age collectible game would thoroughly enjoy this introduction to the latest saga of the mighty MechWarriors of the 32nd Century."
2,Where are the mechs?,"I bought a mech warrior book right? I forced my way about half through nod the only mechs were a forestry mech cutting trees and a mining mech smashing a building. It may be a decent book, but I had different expectations."
4,Vintage Stackpole,"I almost thought this book should have been called Stackpole the return. He returns to the First person narrative that I've always loved. his main character is reminiscent of others I've enjoyed in the past I.E; corran horn, Tarrant Hawkins, and of course Phelan Patrick Kell. A very good book. I would have given it 5 stars if there was more Mech action but i guess a book can only be so long."
3,Different,"This is the first book in the new Dark Age of MechWarrior.I had expected a little more background on the Age, and how it came about. What there is, is slipped in during various slow periods in the book, of which there are many.As with any new genre, there are a few ""technical"" errors between this book, and the game it's based on, but not so's a newcommer would notice.This one comes with a mail-in offer for a model of the mech on the cover, for use in the game. (save your receipt or invoce to redeem it.)For a book called, ""MechWarrior: Dark Age, Ghost War,"" one would expect a little more action than this book has.I was a bit disappointed."
1,Worst heaphones i have ever used,"Unfortunatly, I did not listen to the many people that discouraged me from these head phones, but intstead went ahead and bought them because they looked cool. DO NOT MAKE MY SAME MISTAKE!!! First of all, the fit is horrible. These things flop around on your ears like a couple of floppy cocks. One jump in the air, and they flew off my ears, onto the the floor. The sound would be good except for the fact that the leak so much sound that everyone within about a 15 foot radius of me can immediatly identify what song i am listening too. At times i think more sound is leaked from these phones, than actually enters my ear. because of this, i am forced to turn my mp3 player up all the way jus to get some decent volume. I have come to realize that sony makes only one thing with quality: TVs."
2,"Bad sound, ugly on your head, but comfortable.","Well, these headphones look good online. They are comfortable and easy to put on and feel like you're not wearing them. That's about all that's good about them; the sound is very poor - it cannot support a large amount of bass. At high volumes the sound is intrusive and scratchy. Also, they extrude far out on your head, so you don't really want to wear them in public. Anyway, if you're looking for some good headphones for about the same price, go with the silver Sony MDR-G72LP Street Style Headphones. They look great, sound great, and are built well."
1,One Star,"Only one star and that's just for the design. The sound is tinny at best, the earphones with its square wire ear hanger is just plain uncomfortable. Save your money and get the Sony MDR-EX70LP Earbud Headphones for a little more pocket change."
5,Great bass for ear clip headphones!,"This is easily the best bass I have ever heard on non DJ / Producer headphones. This bass really hits. If you like the sound closer to your ears, then throw on a headband for the best portable ear clip or ear bud sound there is."
3,"Lows are good, highs need work","A nice, smooth (and exaggerated as promised) low end, paired with an unfortunately shrill high end. If it weren't for that high end - which I swear pushes most singers' voices up an octave - these would be great headphones. If you listen to music that has no recognizable voices, they may be perfect for you. For me, they're just cheap 'phones with better bass. Regarding the design, I like them."
3,"Overall good, weird cord setup.","I found these looking for clip-on headphones for my iPod. They looked nice, and from reviews, they seemed to have good sound quality. They are somewhat nice in design, yet could have been designed more user-friendly. The cord is extremely short, even for my small self, so you have to use the akward extension cord.For some strange reason, the left headphone has two cords coming out of it which makes for tangled wires.It is a little hard to put on, but i have gotten used to it. The sound quality is great, and although I am no audio geek, the heavy base is nice for rap and rock."
2,Decent product - if it fits your ears right,"PROS:* Powerful bass, and crisp treble* Cool, stylish design* Price ($20.99)* Sony qualityCONS:* Fits the ears loosely; tends to fall off easily* Most of the bass is lost because of the mediocre fit* Everyone in the room can hear your music* Clip tends to deform over timeOverall, I don't recommend this type of headphones. This is no exception. Go for a different pair of Sony's, particularly Fontopia earbuds or Street Style neckband headphones."
4,A great gift for children.,"Nice book for children. I hope it will give them a taste for birdwatching, and open their eyes 'to nature and its beauty."
5,"Works perfectly, solidly built",Does what you need it to do. Installation is solid and the bar is a bar.
2,Solid but a pain,"Okay, it's very sturdy if mounted properly. And the little turning rivets in the brackets keep it from ever slipping out in use. The little rivets rotate down and LOCCk the pentagram shaped end in place.HOWEVER... how many people have ever had the problem of a chin-up bar slipping UP and off the brackets while in use? I think this is a feature put in more for liability purposes than any real-world need.The upshot is, you have to wrestle with the thing EVERY single time you take it down. Since I have it up in a regular doorway we need to use, this is a serious drawback. The mechanism is very effective -- meaning it just fights you every time you want to take it down. It's not a lot of fun and frankly not something you would want to wrestle with every day. Get one of the bars with a round-end, unless you're prepared to leave the bar up pretty much indefinitely."
5,Very good product!,"This pull up bar was very easy to install and works great! Just make sure you have enough room in your door frame to hang the bar, the door frame I wanted to use has a lip on it.. so I was only able to use 3 of the 5 screws on each side, still works completely fine... but I also only way 150. Anyway, great product!"
3,Need to Love History to get through this.,"A classic that directly connects today's people with the those thousands of years ago. A true time machine that lends incite into human nature and conflict that exist even today. I found this book to be a great mirror that we can see ourselves in if one cares to change names and places to find similarities.Although very long and documentary in style, it is a Maciavellian account of the human societal animal. When one puts history like this into perspective with the growth of city states into nation states, one can see that although we may advance technologically - people haven't really changed all that much.Warning: Be prepared to be dragged through account after account of historical events and long speeches. Nevertheless, a classic one will be happy to read."
4,Salvaging the reputation of a good recording,"I'm not sure what the other reviewer was listening to when he wrote his review. While this may not be a top recording, it is certainly better than one star! There are so many good recordings of this symphony that one would be hard pressed to offer one as definitive. And though there is much competition this is a good recording. The second movement is a little on the slow side but it is clear, detailed, and precise. The brass is outstanding and the string sound is rich and full. What more could you ask? The Cincinnati Symphony sounded so much better under Lopez-Cobos than Jarvi. The engineering is also excellent. Some Telarc recordings with Cincinnati tend to sound dry, but not this one. Don't let the single star review scare you, this is a decent Bruckner 9."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"Like most of Georg Tintner's recordings on Naxos, Jesus Lopez-Cobos fails to make an impression on me with his conducting. Like the Tintner recording of the 9th on Naxos, Lopez-Cobos can barely handle this massive score and neither can the Cincinati Symphony Orchestra. The 2nd movement ""Scherzo"" is played at too slow of a pace. The handling of the tempi ruins the whole performance for me. Pathetic actually, especially compared with Gunter Wand's Colonge Radio Symphony/RCA and Berlin Philharmonic/RCA readings, Giulini's Vienna Philharmonic reading, and Chailly's Royal Concertgebouw reading.There are much better recordings than this sad excuse for a recording. I can only hope that Paavo Jarvi's interpretations with Cincinati receive better, more committed performances."
5,Best massager bar none!,"I found this at a Tuesday Morning store and I'm so glad I bought it. Both my sons lift weights and love this after a serious workout leaves them with sore muscles. My husband is on his feel all day, causing his legs to swell below the knee and he can't wait to get home and use it. I find it fabulous for low back pain. It's heavy, so you don't have to work too hard pressing it down on your body. I plan on ordering two more - one for the son who's moving out, and one as a gift for my sister-in-law who has back pain. Just remember it's too strong to use on ""bony"" parts of your body. But your muscles will love it."
4,book,"I haven't started to read it, yet, but I'm sure it will be interesting. I enjoyed watching ""The Waltons"", so I wanted to read about the real family."
2,"Blows fine, brush useless",The brush is much to soft and flexible. Doesnt grab my hair; the bristles just sort of bend over the top layer. You cant get a smoothe style like that. And that is what this type of dryer is suppoed to do. They need to change the brush bristles!
1,Prefer old style brush,The new style hand held hair dryers are not good for short hair. Curly or wavy short hair was styled easier with the smaller brush with stiffer bristles. The 1200-1500 watt dryers worked the best. I wish I could find one of the older models.
2,Weak Gooseneck,I tried to mount it horizontally and it was to weak to hold up a fairly lightweight mic. Was very unimpressed.
1,Wolfman Jack Rolls in his Grave,"How appropriate that Wolfman Jack did this comp for Halloween, because he must have risen from the Dead to include the X-Files Theme, which was recorded about ten years after he died.This album is schlock, and it isn't the original artists.Wolfman Jack would be ashamed."
4,A classic,"The Odyssey is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. To put Homer's text in perspective, it is Shakspeare's parallel. Heroic characters with unwavering values, avengers of love, and a quest with danger, monsters, and mythical beings are a few of the elements that enabled The Odyssey to survive over three thousand years. This piece of work enticed my mind and the flow of words is incredible. This story takes the reader through the tribulations of each character. I would suggest The Odyssey to all kinds of readers; it is not stereotypical of any one person. I was required to read this book in my 8th grade class, and I was lucky to have read it before. Reading it again in a different environment in which we discussed and evaluated the book made it that much more intriguing. I highly recommend this book and find out why it has lasted all these years."
5,The Best Translation of a Classic,"I won't waste a lot of time explaining why you should read this book. The epics of Homer are a cornerstone of western society. One cannot live in the modern west without being touched by the works of Homer. It should be compulsory to read the homeric epics for all literate people in the Western World. That said, translations of this book are as numerous as the stars and if only they were even half that bright. Fitzgerald's translation is the best I've seen (and believe me I've seen some bad ones and some good.) If I were to recommend one in particular this would be it."
5,"Fitzgerald's Odyssey: accurate, readable, fantastic.","Most translations of the Odyssey suffer from stilted English, Victorian hang-overs, and weak attempts to bring the Greek verse into English. I struggled with the original in high school and never appreciated the dactylic hexameter at the time. But Fitzgerald makes the epic come alive in energetic images that work as vivid English. His translation is more accurate than others: his text reads much closer to the original word-to-word, but even more importantly in spirit and feeling. Homer comes through, the lament of the lonely, the lost, yearning for home, struggling to overcome every obstacle. This is a universal story, timeless, intense, entertaining, fantastic"
4,"""The Odyssey""- two thunbs up","The Odyssey is in my opinion, a piece of literature that will last in the minds of whoever reads it forever. This novel has set the standard for all other epics to this day. Odysseus( the main character) is one of the most memorable hero's ever. He is confident and relies on his instinct. Odysseus is a complicated character. He can be merciful and brutal. Homer has created a character that is more than a hero but a person as well.Odysseus is human just like the rest of us. He has strengths and weaknesses like everyone else. Odysseus is a hero the reader of the story can relate to. He can cry when he is sad and does not hesitate to kill when needed. He can also make mistakes, one of the major flaws he has is his curiosity. An example of this is when he needlessly taunted the Cyclops and revealed his name. This could be considered to be his Kryptonite and Achilles heel."
3,Go For The Sparknotes,"If you are buying this book for required reading (which you very well may be since I don't know a single person who would read this if they didn't have to), I feel for you. Truly. I had to read this in school, and let me tell you, it's no picnic. At first glance, The Odyssey looks like a LONG book that no one has been able to understand since 1362, but after you get past all the impossible language, its a very interesting book. There are many themes in The Odyssey that relate to today's world, believe it or not. It's also a very thought provoking study of the society back in Homer's time. For intstance, Odysseus was considered a hero even though he cheated on his wife with some of the goddesses, like Calypso. It takes a lot of time and effort to truly read this book, but it is worth it. Trust me. And if you find yourself having no idea whatsoever what is going on (which is what happened to me), I recommend Sparknotes.com. They'll clear everything up."
3,The odissey in the news.,"I think that this book in parts is good, because it talks about a men that are capted by a mounster and that mounster dont led odisseus go back home to see his family, and is for that, that I dont like to much these book, because no body can live far of his family, and eather no knowing nothing of his family. many people said that is bether live out his family and this book show us that if love concuires in that family, no matter who traing to separate that family, at last ther would be together."
3,The Odyssey a classic,I think that the Odyssey is a good book to read because it talks about excited things that happend in life. It is an intresting book to read. Alot people that I now have read this book.Now that I read this book I have enjoy this book alot and my friends have to. I put for the title of the review.The Odyssey a classic because I think this book is going to continue to success because I think that the people are going to continue reading this book. I think that is a very import book.
5,The oldest classic,"Many people do not realize that Odyssey (and Iliad) is poetry. The English translation is quite awkward. The text is more than2800 years old and ancient Greek was a highly structured language. It was much more complex than any other Western including the currently spoken Greek. The fact that readers find it compelling today proves its value. On the other hand it requires, from the reader, to understand the natural limitations of translating poetic story telling and also a level of culture. Considering this, the human-centric focus and the genius of Homer will become evident."
5,Captivating epic poetry.,"Fitzgerald's translation of The Odyssey is a great, readable yarn. The verse is transparent, more captivating than much best-selling fiction. It was the first classical Greek or Roman literature I read, and I re-read it every few years. I read little poetry, but I recommend Fitzgerald's translations highly; The Odyssey is my favorite."
2,"comme-ci, comme-ca","i had to read this dumb book for school which made me lose all interest in it. i am sure it is a great epic poem and all that but if it is so great, don't make us lose all hope by forcing us to read it"
1,Yet More Hollywood Pablum,"Though Fitzgerald is a competent translator of Homer's Spike-Lee influenced [Aeolian], the disappointing truth is you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Homer would be best left outside the circle of his fellow Greeks Sophocles and Plato and re-establish himself as a writer for SNL or maybe Married with Children. Were Homer alive today hew would no doubt be plotting out the next Buffy the Vampire Slayer storyboard as we speak. Those who know the original Greek can feel the harsh dissonance of Homer's words echoing in Fitzgerald. English has blunted some of the edges, but the overall horrific effect of Homer's screeches and moans is too evil to killed, yet too sinister to be contemplated."
2,The odyssey,"the book was not really interesting. It might be cause i dont like to read, could be a reason why i didnt like it. But it has little interesting things like all those monsters, gods and characteres that appeared there. Most of the class did like it cause the universal themes were interesting. Maybe i should read it again and focus more to understand it a little bit more."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!,"this book is definitely one of the most boring books i have ever read! it could not hold my attention for more than two minutes, and ordinarily i have a long attention span. it was a horrible book, and i hope i never have to read anything like it again."
4,great story,Robert fitzgerald does an excellent job of interrupting Homer's thoughts. i had to read this for my 9th grade english class. it was excellent. i couldn't put the book down. very thrilling.
3,Prayer,"This is a book of prayer to renounce the devil and bring Jesus into your heart. The devil will make you think you get rewarded, when really you end up in hell. Surrender yourself to Jesus and be rid of sins. This starts with baptism."
5,Pleased Plus,"I received my book order from Princelight-7 on Amazon Marketplace today; only a surprising two day wait from day of purchase. It arrived in pristine condition, being professionally wrapped for safe shipping. I most certainly will continue to do business with Amazon.com, and look forward to future dealings with Princelight-7, also.Sincerely,Jaye Thomas"
2,Not for thick hair,"I own this product. It is definately a disappointment if you have thick hair. It takes forever to dry hair and I have to use thin sections (which takes hours) over and over to get any drying effect even on the highest speed. I use it on my 9 yr olds hair, which is thick also and straight. To get any styling effects on her hair, it has to be almost dry first. I feel it works better on naturally straight and fine hair. This wasnt one of Revlons finest. I can see why its discontinued."
4,Nice small subwoofer,"This subwoofer is great for situations where you don't need loud, earth-shattering bass. It outputs good clean low end and offers multiple inputs. I'm very happy with it."
2,defective product,"Hair dryer seemed to be a good product at first however, within a few days, the temperature control button stopped working (it would just slide up and down without actually locking into a particular temperature). Shortly after that, the mechanism to actually turn on the hair dryer jammed almost as if it were to lock in place. After a few hours, you would have the ability to turn it on again unexplicably. The on/off problem was really hit and miss; there was no telling when it would happen. I eventually decided to exchange the product but was unable to due to Target's return policy."
5,Here's to Zuzu!,"This is such a wonderful book! I wasn't much of an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" fan until I met the lovely Karolyn Grimes recently. She spoke about IAWL with such passion that I went out and bought the DVD the next day and watched it again, through new eyes.This book is full of rare photographs as well as little known trivia. You'll feel as though you have a new friend after reading this book.If you love little Zuzu Bailey, then you need to buy this book! And even if you're only a casual viewer of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", you're still going to really enjoy reading this."
5,WOWWWWW,"As a new Christian, I 'devoured' this book in one sitting and I am not a reader from cover to cover.....the gruelling comparisons which he uses are things you will never forget or never should forget when dealing with Satanic attacks. GREAT BOOK, it made me realize what we are up against and how much Satan attacks Christians......a must read even for the non-reader!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I've smelled toilette water before and this didn't even come close. May have set too long and was not longer any good. Go to your local store to make sure you're getting the real thing. I love this fragrance, so I just added more money and went to a store that had a Lancome dept. Payed a little more, but I sure smell good."
4,nice gentle vibrations,"I like this product because it doesn't vibrate you off the map, just nice easy massage where you need a little relaxatoin."
1,Forget calling this a massager,"I was very disappointed after trying out this portable massager. It had very little massage capability. Frankly, if you buy something battery powered to use for a massager, your just wishful thinking. This isn't worthy of your time. I returned it hours after it arrived, just save yourself the trouble and give up the idea of battery-powered portability. Get something that plugs in and has some oommph. ...."
5,This is the real Al McGuire,"Most people may know Al McGuire as one of television's most colorful broadcasters, but the real Al McGuire can be found in his insights into coaching, recruiting and life. Even after his death, McGuire remains a towering figure in sports and one of the most intriguing coaches in college basketball history. This book delves deeply into McGuire in the most telling way possible - his own words."
5,Save money and make it at home,This recipe book is really cool. It has loads of fun recipes to try at home. Some are better than others. The Starbucks Frappuccino recipe is amazing. It doesn't really taste like Starbucks but is very good in its own way. Some of the recipes aren't very practical like making Coca-Cola. There are many ingredients and it would cost you more to make it than to buy it at the store.
4,"Easy recipes, and a bit scary","I picked this up with a few other newer soda books because I own a SodaStream and their natural syrups are overpriced. These recipes are mimicking the actual name-brand colas so it is not surprising that Corn Syrup and other ""very bad for you ingredients"" are included in the recipes. Not surprising, but a wee bit frightening. After all, I think we can all pretty much agree that the products the recipes are copying are not exactly healthy for us.The recipes are very simple, and I plan on substituting a few healthier ingredients where I can. I mainly purchased this because it was very cheap used and I am working on ideas for my own syrups.I recommend the Artisan Soda book as well."
1,where's the petits fours?,"Of 114 recipes, there are 3 that have to do with petits fours. Lots of big pictures, very little good information."
4,just what i was looking for,"I found this book while looking for recipes for tea parties. Not only does this book have a great variety of recipes that I haven't found in standard cook books, it also has wonderful pictures."
1,petit four recipe makes a garden tile,I got this book to make petit fours. The recipe is the pits. The genoise came out like a garden tile. I tired it twice.
3,a disappointment,"This is OK, the Robert Shaw Chorale has it's usual homogenized sound, but there is a certain bite or excitement that I think is missing. Also, as a general rule, I am never totally satisfied with translations."
1,Review of item I DIDN'T receive.,"I can't really review the item I ordered since I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED IT!! I ordered it on or about 3/10/10, and it is now 4/12/10. I contacted the invidivual vendor once and was told the item was shipped 3/11/10. I don't think I believe that! Additionally, I am not the only person with a problem with this vendor. A colleague of mine ordered the same item from the same vendor sometime before I did, and he received his order only last week. The US Postal Service may have its probblems at times, but I can't believe this kind of a delay can be attributed to the post office. I would never order another item from this particular vendor. I ordered this CD to use for rehearsal purposes for an upcoming performance of Haydn's CREATION. I am very close to the point of not needing it anymore because the concert will have been performed."
4,Haydn Creation,The cd was very well done but Robert Shaw' interpretation of the words did not fit with the version we were performing.
1,Don't buy for use outside of the US,"I bought the hairsetter in hopes of using it in Sweden. This was a huge misstake as it can't be done without spending a lot of money on converters and plugs.The voltage is 120 opposed to 220 in Europe and obviously the plug is different. I knew the plug would be different even though there was no information about this. What I didn't think of was the voltage.I find it very strange that there is no information about this, especially when they can see they are shipping to an international address.I would have loved to give the product as rave review but seeing as how I can't even try it, that is not possible.I feel totally cheated as there is no point in sending it back due to shipping costs."
2,Very Technical in scope,"I agree with the editorial review and even though I enjoyed the book it was very technical in nature. I did study voice for 15 years as a mezzo soprano so the technical was very interesting to me plus I'm a fan of Domingo and enjoyed the analysis of the author. However, unless you are a voice student or devoted opera lover, this could be a pretty boring book. Also, German operas have never been Domingo's specialty. I felt the author may be a fan as well and was seeking more time with his subject. Snowman's and Domingo's books are better than this one for general information and bio."
2,On/Off switch broke after less than a year,"I liked this hair dryer a lot, but the on/off switch broke less than a year after I bought it. Would not buy again or recommend it."
2,Not good for Iraq.,"The watch worked for half a year for me and one day it just stopped. It was not damaged, and it had plenty of sun in Iraq. There is no alarm on the watch, and the back light is hard to see the digital numbers at night. Yes there is a small box on the watch that displays digital info."
4,Is that really Joan Rivers?,"Well, it's early Joan Rivers. Not bad, but interesting. She was always her, if you know what I mean. I listened to it somewhat intently, then got distracted, but not sorry for the purchase. Vinyl is a bit cumbersome after the digital revolution. But that's another issue entirely."
2,Don't bother; read the book on which it's based,"I purchased this DVD because I'd read Jeffrey Deaver's gripping book on which it's based - A Maiden's Grave - four times. It was intelligent, subtly witty, and the main characters were unique people about whom I came to care very much (in the case of the criminals, I was surprised and guiltily gleeful upon learning their fate). In fact, one of the pleasures of A Maiden's Grave was the deluge of surprises and the insights into the workings of hostage situations. In the DVD, virtually everything about the story changed, including the title. The situations and character descriptions that made the book a fascinating page-turner were missing. The actors seemed to have little interest in making this a stimulating story (screenplay or direction challenged, perhaps? These are excellent actors). Sad, because they had one hell of a story to tell. My suggestion is to forgo this sad attempt and buy the book."
5,Every parent is raising their own Curious George!,"I will never forget my first trip to the library to check out a Curious George book. The stories I have grown to love are now a permanent part of my 4 year old sons library. This particular book is not only fun and entertaining, but also demonstrates a lesson to be learned. For friends of mine that are expecting children, instead of giving them the traditional clothes or toiletries, I buy them a Curious George book or two that they can cherish as their children get older. It is never too early to read to children, give them a book that will mean as much to them as it did to me."
3,No synchronized pictures,"On audible.com this book is listed under those audiobooks that have synchronized pictures, but it does not. Disappointing, but the book was under $2 and my daughter loves Curious George, so hopefully she will enjoy this even without pictures."
2,You can't always get what you wanted!,"My puppy is named Spike and he needed a new collar at 16-18 inches. His first collar was a Harley Davidson collar with spikes and a HD logo - which made it cost a lot more! But the whole Spike thing is so sweet! He looks really tough!This collar is not 18 inches long. It is 17 inches long and the widest point it can be closed is at 15 inches. When it is closed, its complete circle is 14 inches and that is at its widest possible point. I measured my puppy's neck before I ordered this and it was 15 inches, too small for the 16 inch so I ordered up one size.As a side note, this is not especially a good collar for a puppy as the spikes are actually sharp. We have two puppies in the house and it's just not a good idea."
2,"Another one of those ""Could Have Been Written Better"" books.","Having recently read King Leopold's Ghost, and the in depth descriptions of the atrocities that took place in Africa, I was eager to learn more on the subject. However, this book falls short on the details and fails to put the reader on or anywhere near the ship."
4,Tai Chi for weight loss,My husband was having a really bad back problem tried Yoga and other exercises but did not help as he is overweight. This video really helped his back problem I originally bought it at Best Buy for only $10 but it was discontinued I can't believe how much more expensive it is now. Wish I would have known I would have bought two.
1,DVD great condition; contents dreadful,"This instructional Tai Chi exercise program was absolutely dreadful. Instructions were painfully repetitious (12 repeats of slow technique, then a bunch more a little faster, then a bunch more a little faster, then finally regular pace). A good exercise DVD will spend only a few moments with each new movement and then move to regular pace. The bulk of this DVD is slow, instructional repetition of standard moves. There is no need for such extensive instructions, as the techniques are easy to follow. So, actually losing weight (as the DVD title suggests) is highly improbable. Sadly, I threw this DVD into the trash."
4,helpful,I was leading a bible study through Titus and I found this a helpful little booklet in lloking for questions and angles in dealing witht the text.
3,Just OK,"Not to my taste, for the most part, but I appreciate the work that obviously went into it. I'm not a student, just someone who had a yen to read poetry, so all I was looking for was poems I liked to read. This book is much more to my taste:The Seashell Anthology of Great PoetrySome of the illustrations are dumb to the point of being insulting - yes, I can figure out that the subject of ""I like to see it lap the miles"" is a train without having a picture drawn for me. (And not a particularly good picture - a really good picture I would have enjoyed for itself.) In general, I found the illustrations annoying and distracting. They just weren't very good. But, again, all I'm speaking of is my personal taste."
2,IT's ok,"It's a giant book yes but that's about all, but packs a rather small punch in content. It has some great poems but not all are to be considered great just part of a collection to fill pages.If you are in search of a book of wonderful poetryI highly recommend this bookA Romantic's Passion: The Tenth Muse"
4,Childhood memories,"This book is perfect when feeling nostalgic, lots of poems I learned as a child and many more to suit ones mood. Lovely to dip in to when you feel the need"
2,Disappointed,"Every anthology editor has a right to include what he likes, even his own poems, as this one does.I have several issues with this collection, its omissions and selections, however I find that representing Edna St. Vincent Millay by just a single, short and superficial poem like ""First Fig"" perpetuates the narrow-minded blacklisting of her by a few critics from the fifties who hated her anti-war speeches, feminist sentiments and free-wheeling lifestyle. Enough already. Millay is one of America's great poets, up there with Whitman, Frost, Cummings (not included at all), and Dickinson, and her beautiful sonnets speak to us today more than ever.Maybe the next edition of the Giant Book will be giant enough to include more than one of her poems?"
3,Enjoyed some poems,"but the author is into story-telling, lengthy poems so I skipped many of them. Still, not a bad collection and adds to my Kindle collections of poetry."
2,Poems are good - the index isn't.,The selection of poetry is pretty good - just don't count on the index or the table of contents to search for a poem. They are completely off. Inexcusable and absolutely frustrating! How this book ever got published this way is a complete mystery to me.
3,The Giant Book of Poetry,"I'm using this book as a text for a course and I'm so happy to have it as a survey of great poems. However, I'm disappointed that the editors allowed the poems to be printed without the poets intended layout. For example a sonnet is meant to be in four stanzas: four lines for the first three and two lines for the last. When there are no breaks between stanzas it all but destroys the initial impact of the poem, and requires research to ascertain it's correct form. I'm sure I'm missing a lot because I don't always know to do this. The worst disservice is done to a poet like Gerard Manley Hopkins who is not easily accessible for modern readers but whose reach is ecstatic when understood and deeply felt. All tools to penetrate the poem are critical. I hope these errors are corrected in the next edition."
5,Fits Like a Glove,"Amazon is so accurate in their product, This is the second car item that i bought from you and i've very satisfied, and would recommend anyone, as long as they know what they are looking for, to buy from AMAZON."
3,2 great stories and 1 bad one,"I bought this book for Johnston's story and ended up liking Stuart's story the best of the three. Both had strong characters, hot romance and good plots. If you like Harlequin type romances, you will love these two stories.On the other hand, Rush's story was just bad. Rachel's character was okay, although why she had any feelings at all for Rand I sure couldn't figure out. I've read plenty of romances where the heros had issues as a result of their pasts, but this guy has ISSUES. I felt no sympathy for this guy at all; he was just cruel and his past was no justification for it. The plot was just terrible as well; like another reviewer said, it was just WEIRD and the progression just didn't make sense a lot of the time. It's a shame this story was included with the other two; it really brought down the quality of entire book. I give Johnston and Stuart four stars and Rush two stars."
5,AWESOME!!,"Well, I actually have not listened to the CD but I had a chance to see them in concert at Coffee Blue in Belmar, New Jersey. I am friends with the bass players brother, Stephen, and I also know the bass player himself Ryan Hackett. Very good, awesome performance, definitely buy the CD."
4,Nice Product,"Other reviews have mentioned the suction cup not working. I have not found that to be true--it works perfectly on our car, very secure seal. I actually like the suction cup better than the visor clip--because the visor clip makes the mirror too close to my face (I'm short so sit up close to the wheel). Overall, a good product. I can now glance at my daughter whenever she yells ""Mommy, look at this!"" from the back seat."
1,Not sticking,I cannot get this to stick to the glass despite many different attempts to clean the surface.
3,Thought Provoking,"This was an interesting book that did a good job of bringing up controversial and thought-provoking subjects relating to education and technology. Although Papert makes some good points about how technology could be better utilized in the classroom, he takes the extreme point of view that it could and should totally revolutionize the way that kids learn and that schools operate. Whether or not you as the reader agree with him or not, it is a good read for anyone interested in either education or technology that is sure to make you at least analyze your own points of view on both topics."
3,For those that dream of changes to the school systems,"Seymour Papert, a mathematician, educator, and scientist, begins ""The Children's Machine"" with the question, ""How does the relationship between children and computers affect learning?He writes passionately about his experiences with schools, children, learning, and their intersections. Drawing from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, Papert lays out the compelling reasons for rethinking education in this Information Age. His words echo those of Piaget and many others that are completely convinced that there is indeed hope for change. Continuing in the tradition of his previous book ""Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas"" and thoroughly describing the further innovative potential of his own Logo program, Papert does not fail to educate, inspire, and provoke his readers. He ends the book with a chapter on what can be done now, and, almost 15 years since its release, his ideas are still relevant."
4,Good Family Fun,"This film shows Whoopi Goldberg at her big mouth wise cracking best. The film is about a rich chairman who buys the New York Nicks and try's to turn a losing team into a freak show to make money. So he hires a big mouth fan as the head coach who he beleives can't coach. The first half of the film is funniest as Whoopi Goldberg tells the Nicks coaches what she really thinks of them. Some of the misfit players are quite good to. There is a Russian who can't speak any English, a great player except he won't pass the ball and a player who is more interested in his failing marriage. All in all, kids will love this one and adults should enjoy some of the humour."
1,Buyer Disappointment Diary,"A 'one star' rating isn't low enough. What a schlocky rehash of 1970s vintage film, mixed with gimmicky 'count down to footage' tricks, and goofy computer pull-down menus to advance to next scenes. A distasteful mix of music that cheapens the few minutes of actual WWII footage. What's THAT all about??? The topic is ""Eagle's Nest"", but all I saw was a distance shot of Hitler's ""tea house"" as a small shadow at the top of a mountain peak, a close-up shot of a couple of blocks from the corner of a building, and ""American soldiers looting the spoils of war"". This video should be renamed by dropping the ""diaries"" and adding ""Big"" as the first word in the title."
3,Horrible for sports!! But good for lounging.,"I purchased these thinking that they would be great for sports...you know stay on my ears as I'm running/jogging/etc. Not the case. The fact that a tiny wind blast would knock them off my head made a 3 mile jog turn into choir of holding the darn things to my head!! However, the sound quality is great for the price (even though other reviews say differently). They are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. All and all, if you plan to keep upright and still throughout wearing them, they are a good buy."
4,Nice ones but not perfect,"Honestly I expected more from these head phones !!pros- very nice shape, interchangable stuff is cool. best thing I liked is that cord is such long that I have no problem if I use them in GYM.with my height 5'4""I can keep my CD player on floor and still can stand easily wearing them !!!!Cons- they dont fit snuggly, For small ears they will be loose. But for guys They should be good."
4,Really good sound quality,"I bought this last year from Amazon and yep they still working as good as the first day, their loud with an awesome quality sound. My only complaint would be that the cords gets tangles very easily, but well im ok with that. Bottom line good earphones for regular use, I definitly recommend them (sorry for my english)"
4,Its good but could have been better,"I bought these headphones for my office computer. I generally use headphones on only one ear for most of the videos (like review, product hands-on, etc). This the reason that I bought these headphones. But the headphones are little heavy. If I wear only one headphone, the other one because of the weight as well as the design, pulls the headphones down. So, I end up wearing both the headphones or hooking it to my shirt. I am little disappointed by that.Other than that its a good headphone. The sound quality is really good. It takes a little time to wear. Once you wear it, its very comfortable. The cord is long which is big plus for me."
5,Great Pair of Heaphones,Solid pair of AFFORDABLE headphones. I'm having to order new foam ear thingies rather than a new pair. That's a good sign.
4,"Quality, Comfortable headphones","After lots of searching for quality ear clip headphones I went with these ones and am very happy I did. The sound is great, they are comfortable to wear. If you like the ear clip design better than the ubiquitous earbuds, these are the headphones to get. Props to Sony."
5,top tier comfort,"I generally have a very hard time wearing headphones for more than an hour without my ears getting unbearably sore. But I wear these headphones for 20-40 hours/week with no discomfort. The swivel clips are a nice feature. The sound quality is fine for my purposes, and they have been durable for over a year. Great product!"
4,Lots of sound,"This is actually my second pair of these. They have great sound for a non-noise cancelling, non-in the ear, non-surround the ear headphone. I pick up sounds on these I don't hear with my studio headphones. The only problem is despite Sony's best effort the nature of ear wraps makes them hurt a little with extended use. My limit for these is about 90 minutes. But still they are by far my preferred headphones for my new Zune."
1,these don't work on small ears,"I have small ears and although these headphones look small, they hung off my ears and bent the tops of my ears down. There's no way they would have stayed on while running. I returned them immediately."
2,Ok,I bought these on the spur of the moment. I need clip headphones after my RCA died right in the middle of my family's California trip. There was only a small electronics store and they only sold these clip headphones. They have a good full sound to them but not a lot of bass. I recently found out Panasonic makes this type for the same price but with a fuller bass range. The Sony only goes to 20Hz but the Panasonic goes all the way to 14Hz. I would just go for those.
5,Great if you hate earbuds,"I can't stand earbud type headphones but like having something that I can tuck in my purse or hippocket, these work wonderfully. They fit more securely than my old set, are comfortable and have good sound quality for the price."
4,Great Sound for Price,Confort is great very lieght weight doesnt even feel at times that you have the earphones on.. The color blue look sweet and look very stylish. The sound is clean and balanced. If you are into bass this will score a 3 out of 5. Mids are 4 0f 5. and 4.5 out of 5. The sound is not exagerated it sounds balanced.. I wish that the earphones would wrap more tighly to ear to hear all over sounds/but still sounds good:)
3,Wires entangle a lot but great sound.,"Sound quality is good.Ease of wearing it and comfortness decreases with time.After wearing the headphones for about more than an hour, the back portion of ears inflict pain.Wires entangle a lot but could manage it."
2,Diffucult to put on and uncomfortable,"Most of the reviews stated that these clip on headphones were comfortable and had great sound. They may have had good sound, however they were difficult to put on and were uncomfortable when you finally got them situated. I would not recommend these ear clips."
3,Just a bit low on sound volume,"Good head phones but I use them only for running and exercising. I like to have loud music playing and these headphones seem not to get as loud as Id like. They are comfortable and, for the price, I do not feel like I was ripped off. Again good phones, just wish they could get a bit louder."
4,Fun and Functional earphones,"These eardphones have all I was looking for. I don't like in the ear buds or over the head bands. These are just what I was looking for. The extra color clips are a great bonus. The small cord that connects the 2 ear phones is made to go behind your head for extra comfort. The other cord is very long. As a shorter person, it is too long for me but I can easily wrap it up and tie with a twisty tie. some kind of cord winder would be a great addition to these (and most) earphones. Also the cords between the 2 phones do seem to get twisted/tangled together easily. A minor irritation."
5,Great sound and very durable!,"These headphones have been with me through thick and thin for about the past SIX years. Unfortunately, one side has finally stopped working so I have to buy new ones. I've never had a problem with other people hearing my music, though I don't tend to play it very loudly. I've pulled the cords every which way, dropped the speaker parts, and I think they've probably also gotten wet at some point... and they've only now stopped working. The only downfall I've ever found is a lack of color selection for the covers.I definitely recommend these headphones."
4,Good day-to-day headphones,"I bought these because my Maxwell clip-on headphones died after many years of use. I prefer ones that slide over the ears as opposed to ear buds that insert in your ears. These are pretty comfortable, if a little loose. The cord is super long, which can be good or bad depending on your use. (For me, it's too long since I carry my iPod in my pocket or purse, so there is a lot of excess. It's not a big deal, and is probably a benefit if you are using them to attach to a computer or stereo.) The sound quality is fine and what I would expect for this size, price, and type of headset. They are great headphones for normal, daily use."
3,Get's the job done,I bought these for running/exercising purposes only as my in-ear earphones used to get too much sweat on them to function properly. So far these have stayed on my ear and havent stopped working because of moisture. I also purchased this type of earphone because ear buds produce a strong thudding sound as feet hit the ground especially on treadmills.As other reviews have stated the chord is longer then usual and does get tangled fairly easily. Sound quality is good for the price.
2,"not suitable for people with small ears, ok sound quality","This headset is not suitable for those with smaller ears. When I jogged, the ear pieces always fell off. The sound quality is not the best, but it is ok considering that you are only using them for short-term use while working out. The material that are used to make this headset also seemed not too durable, although I only used this for 1 day so I can't speak to how durable it is in the long-term.However, if the ear pieces actually stayed on my ears, I would keep them."
2,Was Not Mentioned that Cord is Asymmetrical,"Design is nice, but both the Amazon description and the packaging failed to mention that the cord connecting the headphones is asymmetrical. The reason I had ordered this set was because it was one of the few that wasn't listed as having an asymmetrical cord. Will be returning/reselling."
3,O.K. for the money,"I'm not a big headphone speaker user. I hate having things in my ear, that is why I like the over the ear design. They do bother my ears after an hour when I wear my glasses. They don't block out the outside noise. I like that since I just want portable music. MY hearing isn't that great so I'm not a great judge on all of the tech. stuffBottom line: They are O.K., the price was right"
3,Not for long time use.,"it works well, but if you wear it too long, you feel the numb on the ears, because of the clip. (a bit heavy if compare to my nintendo headphone,same clip style, but more comfortable then this sony one)"
2,Not what I expected.,"I listen to books on tape to fall asleep and have gone through so many pairs of earphones it isn't funny. These do not fit my ears very well and they flop around. Granted I do not have dumbo ears but more like hamster ones that are hard to fit. My dilema is, should I wish for bigger ears or more suitable earphones?"
2,"I hate these headphones, they hurt my ears.","I bought these headphones for working out. The sound is pretty good, nothing exceptional or bad. My biggest problem is that they really pinch your ears after 5-10 minutes. The springy clips rotate around, but not out. They compress the upper rigid parts of my ear and it's quite uncomfortable. If you have a normal or petite ear / head you will probably be alright, but if you are a little bigger in either department these may hurt. No matter how I adjust them I have the same result. I will be switching to behind the neck headphones."
2,Don't even bother,"Most people who'd be looking at these headphones are probably looking for something that's stylish enough to wear in public. If that's true for you, don't bother with these. The way these clip on bend the top of your ear downwards; and believe the other reviews when they say they make their ears look foolish. Furthermore, after wearing these for only a few minutes, the tops of my ears turned red. On the plus side, they seem to stay on alright, even though they tend to feel as if they're about to fall off any second. The sound quality is also really decent for headphones this size. But if you're more concerned about quality than comfort and looks, I'd still suggest you look elsewhere."
1,I'll stick to my MDR-G52,"I have very sensitive ears and can notice distortion in sound quality so much that a bad set of headphones kills the experience for me. I have had a set of MDR-G52's for almost 6 years and they have served me well. I picked these up thinking they would be a good alternative. I was wrong...The sound quality was attrocious. It was tinny and whiney sounding. These phones make every thing sound as if it were shifted all into the high frequencies. I listen to alot of hard rock stuff where the lows are important, I couldn't listen to anything because the distortion of the headphones made my ears very fatigued after only a few minutes.They don't fit well, the ear pieces have popped off twice on me and I have been overall dissappointed by this product. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has sensitivity to sound distortion or who has sensitive ears like mine. Your experience will be just as painfull as mine was."
1,Worst Headphones Ever!!,"When my cheap Koss headphones (which I loved) stopped working after a few years, I decided it was time to upgrade to Sony. The design of these headphones looked similar to the Koss ones except these looked cooler. When I got them and tried them on I noticed immediately that they didn't fit securely. I decided to give it a try anyway and took it to the gym. Big mistake. It felt like it would fall off at any time, it didn't fit closely over the ear so the sound quality was awful, plus having a wire across your neck looks ridiculous. As soon as I got home the gym, I ordered Koss headphones like the one I had before, which is what I should have done in the first place since it's cheaper and better quality."
4,My longest lasting headphones,"I've had these for almost six years, the cushion coverings have disintegrated in the last two years, but the ear headphones are still functioning like they were first bought. I'm not a delicate handler, so these have suffered through many pulls and drops. I've used them during commute, at the gym, and with the computer. Unlike my other headphones/earphones, I have not lost sound in either side, nor have anything broken off (though the caps are losing their colors due to frequent scratch-ups). They're not for people looking for noise-canceling, which suits my purposes since I use them in the office and need to be aware of any visitors or hallway disruptions."
4,great headphones,"Headphones sound great, very light & comfortable. The cord is a little long. In addition the cord seems to be an attempt at a tangle free cord, but previous versions of Sony headphones like these had better tangle free cords. This one seems like a cheaper version."
3,decent headphones for the price,I bought these mainly for running. They work pretty well for the most part though the right headphone tends to fall off from time to time and if they aren't positioned right they can pinch a little. I can usually make them work if I mess with them for a bit. The sound quality is fine considering how much these cost. My biggest complaint is that they make my ears stick out and I look kind of silly...however I'm sure I look silly sweating and gasping for air while doing sprint sets so I don't really care that much.
4,"Best ear clip head phones available, except...","These phones sound phenomenal, no doubt, they have plenty of clarity and punch, I love the way they sound. They are lite weight and don't hurt my ears even after hours of wearing them. The clips work perfect and the phones never slip off. The only issue I have is that the cord connected to the phones has a tendency to tangle itself into loops and knots constantly, more so than any other phones I've ever used. It's kind of aggravating to have to untangle the cord all the time, but aside from that, you can't beat the performance, comfort, and price of these ear clips."
3,Good but a bit uncomfy,"These are great for the price.The removable covers come off easy.I bought these because a co-worker ripped off my other sony's, witht the retractable cord when I was on vacation....left them in the office.Anyway, these have decent sound, but the cord from earphone to earphone is a bit short.Get the retractable sony headset, it's much more comfortable."
3,It hurts,The sound quality of the clip is ok regarding its price. But it hurts my ear like real bad. I didnot like its design and its heavy too. Would not buy it again.
2,Dissapointment is always bitter...,"These headphones produce great sound, but they make your ears bend in odd-looking ways. Expect to be laughed at, while wearing these in public, because I sure expect to.The peculiar design of the grips only serve to make it difficult to put on. I spent at least a minute trying to get it right, and when I did get it, it still took about 10 seconds to put them on correctly! Not only that, but they don't feel right. I don't get that oblivious feeling, while wearing them, so it's annoying.My advice? You'd have more comfort wearing the old MDR-G63LP model."
1,Pretty Awful and Uncomfortable,"Looking back, I'm really not sure why I bought these. They fit horribly, don't have good sound quality, and are awkwardly designed. The cord twists up and is impossible to straighten. Definitely recommend finding a different headphones set."
5,My favorite workout headphones,"I REALLY loved these headphones! They fit great and stay on! The sound is SOOOO much better than with my ultra crappy Apple earbuds - there is bass! And my ears don't hurt like they do with earbuds. The cord is a little long for me, but I am a shorty so I understand that. Mine still work, but the foam part that sits against your ear has finally disintegrated cause they are so old. Hoping I can find some new pads so I can keep wearing these!I have heard the new version is not as good as these, so I really hope mine keep on truckin."
4,very nice,i bought this item in 2009 and it was still working well up until my little niece decided to tear the foam ear cover apart. :Ddefinitely buying this again as a replacement.
3,Good Sound But Poor Physical Exterior,"I bought the cute Pink and White Version at Target and the sound quality is good but it could be better cause it doesn't stick to your ears. The cord is the problem. It is made of a thin rubber covering that wears of and you can see the wires. I take care of it but I guess if it bends to much in one place it tears.Buy at your own risk, if you can care for them better I suppose.I am done with Sony Products. They are just a brand. I have other Sony things that just don't work right."
4,These are great!,"I ordered these as replacements for my iPod. They're extremely comfortable and have a good sound to them. The thing I didn't like is that they're a little bulky and stick out a ways, so you can't lean on anything wearing them. They also don't stay pressed against my ear very well. Overall-these are ideal for around the house or in the car."
3,Won't teach you how to code it..but a good reference book,"This book is horrible if you want to learn how to code JINI. The good points are the wonderful RMI primer in the Appendix, and nice explanations of what is actually going on for each aspect of a JINI network, chapter by chapter.This book can serve as a nice conceptual reference when trying to understand JINI.The wrox book on JINI is also very good, and good to learn the coding.Also, don't expect any email to this author to be answered..."
2,Very verbose - a tome of a book,"Good but Verbose... The book is good, no doubt. But because of its verbosity it is not suitable for people on fast track someone who want to get very fast into a subject, get the gist and get the stuff done.Suggestion: Hello we *know* distributed computing! Just give the features and details. Give us something to think. Don't be a TV serial and make us passive data input device.Recommended for: Recommended for college students but not for veteran professionals.My idea of a good book... K & R."
5,I actually have this lens,"I bought it on eBay for a steal. I've used it a few times on my FM3a and FM2 cameras. I haven't done any work with it on digital, but it is a solid performer with color print film on the above mentioned cameras. It is faster and more interesting than the more common 24mm f/2.8 AI-S (or various 28mm lenses). I like mine and I will never sell it, but I know there are modern versions that are objectively better."
4,Another enjoyable Crow performance,"Crow continues to deliver on every song that I have seen on any video. This DVD is no exception.As others have stated, the DVD is filmed in a dark venue, which spares us lots of crowd shots and keeps the camera on Sheryl's front side most of the time.5.1 DTS and Dolby supported, and stereo.Lighting and sound seem pretty good to me.Hard to Make a stand, winding road, Las Vegas, change would do you good,run baby, if it makes you happy, , sweet Rosalyn, redemption day, can't cry anymore, strong enough, maybe Angela, all i wanna do, superstar, ordinary morning with Clapton,on the outside. crow interview and some other stuff.Pay attention to where you are ordering the DVD, I bought from a vendor in Portugal (I'm not sure why) and got a region 2-6 DVD which plays fine on my PC, but not my Panasonic blu ray player.Recommendation: If you like Crow buy the DVD."
4,Not one of Sheryl's best,"This concert was not of the best quality production or music wise.... The best performance was probably the guest appearance by Eric Clapton. I think that Peter Stroud did a much better job at lead guitar than whomever was at this concert. Also missing was Mikey at the keyboards. However, the concert was still very much worth watching!!"
1,Produced and filmed by who ??,"Sheryl, the music and the venue could have been much nicer if it wasn't for the fool who produced the dvd. It sometimes feels like you want to get seasick with the amount of angle changes and different shots. Professional musician with a very poor filmed and produced concert.... Rather look for another live performance not produced by the same person."
1,Cheryl Crow LIVE FROM LONDON,Beware this dvd does not play on region code 1 even though it says all regions in the description. I am awaiting return instructions from the seller.
2,All Stuck Up or Not!,"Please don't waste your money on this item! Especially if your car is equipped with a rear window defogger. The elements in the back windshield prevent the suction cups from sticking properly. Even worse, when the shade is installed, it is not wide enough. Seldomly does this item even block the sun from my baby's eyes. Try ""One Step Ahead"", they have three shades, one wide enough for the back window and two shades for the back side windows. The window shades from ""One Step Ahead"" also stay on the window."
1,Quote,"A better alternative, April 4, 2002Reviewer: bdmorache from Bristol, CTWhile this seems like a great idea, and believe me it can come in handy, as a Child Restraint Technician I can not recomend the roller type of sunshade. Not only are the suction cups choking hazards, but they will mark your windows after a couple of months. But more importantly, in a crash, the metal rod of the roller will become a projectile, imbedding itself in whatever may be convienent. The sunshades that simply stick on with static cling are much easier and have none of the hazards of the roll on types. When the suction cups loosen, they become serious choking hazards."
2,Not worth buying!,"I thought this was a great idea, but it doesn't even shield the sun from my baby's eyes, even when she's in the center of the back seat (I drive a Mercury Mountaineer). The other problem is that it's difficult to see through the shield when you're driving. My husband took the one off rear left window because he couldn't see through the shield to look at his blindspot. I guess from that angle, it's not easy to see through."
1,Roller Shade,"We received a rolling sun shade as a baby gift, and attached it to the window in our car. At a car seat safety check up offered by our city police, we were advised to not use this. If an accident were to occur, the shield would fly off the window and the metal rods can injure your child. Use a vinyl film shade that sticks directly to the window. And it is impossible to see through the shield. Funny that window tinting is illegal, but a shield that is impossible to see through is ok?"
1,Not worth it....,"I purchased this for our daughter in January. I have a Honda Civic and it barely covered the window. So I decided to turn them sideways, hoping that more of the window would be covered; nope! I agree with the other reviews, it is very difficult to see though these also. I purchased a set of shades that you can see through, are attatched with suction cups and were available in two sizes that are SO much better, and I only paid [money]..."
3,Not THEE best - but it does what it's suppose to!,"My husband and I bought these blinds for our 6 month old son who is a little baby ""vampire"" (he hates bright light shining into his face). It didn't cover the whole window which stinks and the suction cups at the bottom didn't always stay on. I did like the fact that you can hit the button on the side and roll up the shade to get it out of the way at night. We still end up using the shade on the car seat or throwing the baby's blanket over him to block out the sun. All in all, it still does work to a certain extent."
3,"Good, but not right for me","I've had these for a long time. I like how they heat up fast and get pretty hot. I may just be an inexperienced user, but I always get kinks in my hair from these clips, and usually one or two rollers will fall out because the clips aren't very great. Also I think I should be using smaller rollers, but that's not the fault of the product."
4,Enlightening and Difficult,"For a neophyte, I found Transcendental Universe both enlightening and difficult. The Introduction by Christopher Bamford was extremely helpful in placing these lectures in an intelligible context, giving background to the Theosophical Society, and the history of occult mysteries in general. The first three lectures were very helpful as further instruction in occult exercises. The latter three lectures were very difficult going, covering the intricacies of the evolution of consciousness relative to the hierarchies of spiritual beings.Well worth reading and meditating on."
2,not the size I expected,"The product says it is 17"" and I expected a very large lamb. It is 17"" long when you pull the legs horizontal and not very tall. It isn't as cute as the picture looks either. I was rather disappointed!"
1,don't waste your money,It looks nothing like this. It's cheap and very disappointing. I'm returning it. Don't waste your money. I wouldn't have paid $5 for it in a store.
5,The best buy for toy lambs were listed in Amazon,"My Grandaughter is working for a year on a farm. They learn how to milk a cow, how to cook, how to clean, build chicken houses, drive tractors, and taking care of live stock. Her favorite animal are the lambs. So, for a Christmas present we gave her one for her room at the farm"
1,what a joke,"These say they're sold by Amazon but I am amazed. I've ordered many items from Amazon before and have never had one arrive like this. I ordered two of these wiper blades for my Jeep. When they arrived, the box was crushed and halfway torn open. The plastic that the wipers came in were also already torn open and dusty/dirty looking. Inside I found that the two supposedly identical products were completely different wiper blades. They are different lengths and look different in many ways. It's amazing that these were even shipped to a customer. Even in buying stuff on Ebay, I've never received such crap. Hopefully I will get all of my money back. Don't waste your time, just go to the store and get these blades."
2,This is a Power Adapter for use in your car!!!,It does not say anywhere in the title or description but it is not an AC adapter. It has a cigarette lighter plug on it.
1,Read closely,"Item was listed as ""CD"", I got FLOPPY DISKS! I CAN'T USE FLOPPY DISKS! I beleive item was liSted as excelent shape, IT WAS MISSING ONE OF THE TEN FLOPPY DISKS! I think I'll stick to ebay for now on!"
5,Teach Yourself Visually Scrapbooking,This book is a great resource if you do not have time to read. The pictures are very informative and show all the items needed. If you have time to read it is very descriptive on how to do each step. I have really enjoyed using this book!!
3,Less than I had hoped for,"After reading the previous Amazon.com review I gladly purchased this book. I was frankly disappointed by both the size (tiny book) and the lack of fundamentals expressed. The author seems to almost patronize the reader in his simplicity. It was tantamount to expressing that the fundamental of football is scoring more points than the other team and that the details are not important. I have penned for 4 years now competitively and learned very little from this book. I hope that future authors in this sport not scrimp on details and really provide specific details of ""how to"". On the bright side a few ""gems"" were offered such as ""if you chase cattle they will run from you"" so ""put the cow between you and where you want it to go"". The Livingston team penning book also offered by Amazon.com is much better for both the novice and advanced penner."
4,Love it!,"I love the rug. The colors are rich and pretty. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because it took forever to unfold. Maybe if it was shipped rolled in a cylinder, this would not be a problem."
1,Area Rug too thin,"Terrible rug. Too thin...looks like a blanket you would put on the floor. Invest in a quality rug, this one is disappointing."
2,cheap rug,I bought four different rugs at the same time and all the other were quite good. This one is substandard. It is almost impossible to get it to lay flat even after a month or two of lying face down
1,You get what you pay for,"This rug was delivered very quickly, wrapped only in a heavy plastic bag. It appears just as in the photo. It is very light weight and flimsy. I could lift this rug over my head with 1 arm. It has wrinkles in it, like an accordion, and I'm hoping that it will smooth out. I never bought a rug that had these kind of wrinkles in it. In the future, I'll just go to homedepot to buy a rug, even if it costs twice as much."
3,okay,"This rug is quite thin, but pretty for the price and shipped quickly. You'll want to buy a rug pad for it."
3,Great color and design,"This rug is very thin and has wrinkles the entire width of the rug every 12 or 15 inches. I am keeping it so far because it is so pretty. The wavy wrinkles better smooth out, soon or the beauty will not save it from returning."
4,Great color and design,"The product is good in color and design. But the rug is a little bit light in weight. Overall, I like it."
3,PRETTY COLOR..but.....,STIFF...AS...A...BOARD...OMG WAS HORRIBLE TRYING TO LAY IT DOWN WOULDNT COOPERATE! I DO REALLY LOVE THE COLOR AND DESIGN...IM NOT GOING TO SEND BACK BECAUSE SO HARD TO FIND THIS COLOR IN THIS SIZE...BUT WOULD NOT BY ANOTHER..(IT DOESN'T LOOK OR REALLY FEEL CHEAP) JUST...STIFF.I BOUGHT TWO OTHERS FOR MY HALLWAY AND THEY ARE VERY SOFT...BY THE SAME COMPANY TOO?
1,horrible piece of junk,"i bought this carpet based on the reviews.i should have known it was too good to be true.the blue on the picture seems more vibrant than it really is.the carpet is so thin it will almost fly away if you fan it.This is the most sad-looking carpet i've ever seen.it is UGLYYYYYYY! it feels like you are walking on a plastic bag!!!it looks so cheap i can't believe i bought something so ugly. ahhhhh!!! waste of money and time trying to find a blue carpet.returning is so much hassle i prefer to give it away. This ""master-piece"" ended in my basement after i tried so hard to get used to it.i'll donate it to Goodwill;maybe someone smarter than I will find a good use for it.i'll never recommend this item.shippment was speedy and item was well packaged."
3,Good,Good for the price. I bought 2 of these 8 months back.It is flimsy. I put this over the carpet so I can put my baby on it. But it kept moving all the time. Soon the colors were to much for the mind. And now they are in my storage.
4,good book and good game,"Dots and boxes is a very interesting simple abstract game with not an easy strategy to play, this book gives you an idea how to play this game, amazingly this small game is probably one of the best abstract games, comparable to go and better than chess."
4,New card for better games,"I upgraded to meet a game requirement (Battlefield 1942). The card works great with the game and at the low price represents a good alternative to buying a new computer. Includes the transform and lighting engine required for this game and others. Overall very satisfied, simple installation and worked immediately on my Dell. Replaced an old TNT2 card"
3,Sick entertainment for sick minds ...,"Cinematic posturing of love stories disguising odd disjointed nationalist disinformation. Only worth viewing if you like the neo-avante guarde movement of slummy expressionism wrapped in childish anagrams. It was OK, but I was surprised to see it released on VHS with all the other companion stories which suffered rather cloistered exposure."
1,Doesn't stay warm,"The spoon doesn't sit in the charger correctly. You have to play with it to get it to charge. Then when the battery is charged, the spoon stays warm for one or two minutes maximum."
5,Greatest Megatron ever,"Treasure Island Sports Inc. shipped me this Megatron in mint condition and I have not stopped staring at this toy ever since. Transformation is incredible but very difficult due to the fact that the instructions are in Japanese and is like a 40 step process but the pictures help you alot. This toy is so incredible that it resembles the actual cartoon series figure in every detail. I have been looking for a good Megatron to add to my Transformers collection for almost 10 years and because of this new MP-05 masterpiece edition from Takara I can finally do it. The toy is fully articulate and poseable in any way thinkable. This is the best Megatron ever released and it is true to the original one in every way, this is a must have for any G1 Transformers lover. The toy is part Die cast and part plastic, roughly 12 inches tall 5 inches wide. Very detailed from head to toe and is the best Megatron to be released to date."
5,love it,Bought this for my boyfriend who is a long fan of transformers. he really likes Takara Tomy. was in good condition.
2,No Character Development,"I was really disappointed in this novel. For me, the main problem was the constant jumping around from place to place with only a few pages in each place and then on to another place with different characters. As a reader of many WW2 and holocaust novels, I found this book completely lacking in anything to make me care about how bad the Nazis were or to love the partisans and the Jews. It became hard work to actually finish this novel."
5,Her Best Yet,"Ms. Russell creates wonderful characters that she fills out so thoroughly throughout the novel that I cared deeply about most of the people I met in the course of the book: the Jewish refugees, the Italians who protected them, and even most of the Nazis. The plot is never predictable, and never sugar-coated. This is a book of rare quality."
2,It should have been better,"I listened to this book on audio since it was broadcast on XM Book radio. I thought I would really like it, since it covers a subject matter I have routinely enjoyed reading about in the past. I was surprised at how much I didn't like this book. It was very hard to follow with so many characters being introduced in rapid succession. Also, the story line moved from location to location so fast, that I found myself getting disoriented. The reader also read very fast, which only served to compound the problem. I didn't feel connected to the characters and was not moved by the story, as I would have expected to be. I wanted to like this book a whole lot more than I did, but instead, I listened to it because it was on and I have a long ride to work, but I was wishing it would end the whole time."
1,"Boring, slow, too many characters","i wanted to love this book - it was highly recommended and i thought it would be a great read like 'the invisible bridge' was...well this is way too slow, way too many characters...it was like reading a boring text book! i read A LOT of books - you can read my other reviews - so i think i know a good book when i read one - this one just isn't very good..."
3,Broken threads,"I am a big fan of Mary Doria Russell and loved the Sparrow and Children of God. Naturally I was waiting anxiously for her next book. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers though who were less than thrilled with this novel. While the complexity of the writing was a good mental stimulation, I did not find myself connecting with the characters. Just as soon as I felt myself being drawn in, a new direction began and the thread of the character was lost. On a positive note I learned a lot of history (and some Italian) that was facinating. I just expected so much more from one of my all time favorite authors."
2,Long and Tedious,I liked the setting and the story but found it overlong and hard to wade through. I gave up and didn't finish the book.
5,A Thread of Grace,Book arrived as described; excellent condition; on-time delivery; would definitely order from book provider again.
2,A bit of a mess,"Russell's third novel is as chaotic as the guerilla war of its setting. There is no clear protagonist, nor anything like a linear plot. The novel has as many major characters as any by Michener, but with only half the pages and covering a span of two years, not hundreds. Just when someone becomes interesting, Russell's onto someone, or back to someone we've forgotten, who's by the way no using an alias (make sure to refer often to the reference guide at the front of the book). With only 40 pages left in the book, a major new character literally drops from the sky. Why? And why should we care?Russell's prose is, as always, beautiful, and the themes she explores are rich and provocative. The title refers to a on old Hebrew saying: No matter how dark the tapestry God weaves, there is always a thread of grace. This is more of a patchwork quilt, but filled with grace nonetheless."
3,book lost,"I have heard the author speak and she is terrific.want to read all of her books. Sadly, this one was lost in the mail so I cannot review it. Her latest book, DOC, is about Doc Holliday, and it sounds wonderful - some of his family were portrayed in Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind."
2,Not up to the challenge,"Overall, this was a disappointment. The potential for a great novel was there, but it suffered due to poor execution. Writing in the multi-character perspective is challenging for the best of writers, unfortunately Mary Doria Russell wasn't up to the challenge. The novel is very fragmented and choppy. I'm still a fan of the author and the concept was good, best of luck on the next one (I hope it doesn't take another 7 years)."
3,Just okay. . .,"This book is well written but there are too many characters to keep track of and none of these individuals have enough depth to create any connection with the reader.I guess with the sad and disturbing subject matter being described, it's easier to handle if you're indifferent to the characters. . ."
2,Nihilistic drama,"I realize lots of people like this book, but I want to insert a word of caution. The book is engaging and gripping, but ultimately, it is a nihilistic view of this period of history. There are no winners, not even survivors, only victims. No triumph over the Nazi evil, no future for those who fought them, no State of Israel (one character, after losing everything of course, wanders off to ""Palestine"" and is never heard from again.) The woman who lives past the war can never look forward, but remains in grief over the past. Religion (both Jewish and Christian) is whimsical and finally irrelevant to life and the future. I do not recommend this book to Holocaust survivors, and I hope no one would suggest making it required reading in school. It can be enjoyed as a melodrama, but it is not instructional."
5,This book will stay in your head for years,"I read this book years ago, but it still sticks in my head. I loved the characters, and was drawn into their lives. I felt the horror and loss that the Holocost caused. Other, simpler books, described a situation that was too horific to really ""feel"". This book made me love the characters and mourn their ultimate fate. It is not an easy read, but well worth the effort."
4,Enjoyed this Book,This book was very interesting. I hadn't heard much about the effort that some Italians took to save Jews during WWII. It led to many discussions with friends & family.
4,a thread of grace by mary doria russell,This is a very intense novel. A little difficult to read due to theitalain and also the introduction of a large cast of characters at the beginning. She does however give a chart of who the characters are.A piece of history that has been easily forgotten the subject/ plot wassuperb. This makes this an enjoyable and memorable book.True to Mary Doria Russell the ending is dynamic and shocking; that is her modus operandus. I definitely recommend thi.
1,Must read Quickly,Mary Russell's book A Thread of Greace is a very difficult book to read. Keeping track of the main characters is a challenge unless you sit down and read it all in one or two settings. I see it as just another story of how the WWII holocsust affected so many people and I don't enjoy reading about that subject anymore. I would encourage the author to return to writing science fiction novels. Her first two novels are supurb.
5,Extraordinary,"This book is extraordinary. The characters are realized and compelling, and the story--actually, the stories threaded together in this novel-- are riveting. There is an added boon of immersion into a world of little-known historical fact. An unexpected gem, which cannot be more highly recommended."
2,Center Lock Easily Falls Out,THe center lock easily falls out and makes it's easy for the dog to chew it up. The cube itself can be very noisy but that doesn't bother me and the dog loves it. I just wish my dog hadn't chewed up the center lock. I only had the cube for a few weeks before it fell out and she chewed it.
2,Not impressed,My 8 month old labradoodle prefers the one that is round (another brand). The square design on this one makes him scoot it around which seems to lose his interest rather quickly. Plus it's rather noisy.
3,fun for him... not for me!,"my 14 week old puppy LOVES the buster cube. I ordered the large one and had NO problem with the instructions and also found the ""difficult setting"" too easy for my shepherd/jindo mix. He WOULD play for hours im sure if i didnt have hardwood floors and consideration for the neighbor below me ... and my own sanity. Not sure why its made of such hard plastic but its like a car wreck in your home. I can handle about 5 minutes of it and then a have to put it away much to the dismay of my very entertained pup. This is a great idea but maybe best for people with carpeting or possibly just an 'outside toy'."
3,"Loved it at first, but it's not very sanitary","I received the mini buster cube and my mini schnauzer had tons of fun with it. I put his kibble dinner in it and he tossed it around and got most of it out. However, over time I could hear that food ""dust"" was being left behind, and I found this product absolutely impossible to open and clean.I tried to open with the instructions many times, asked different people for help, but the opening on the mini cube is so small that I couldn't really get my thumb in there (as the instructions recommend).It was left unused for a bit and then one day when I picked up a small swarm of flies flew out of it! It was so disgusting I ended up throwing it away.If you can manage to open it and clean it, this would be a perfect toy. Perhaps people have better luck with larged sized cube because it might be easier to open, but that one is much too big for my little dog."
4,"My dog didn't like it, but my friend's dog loved it","When my maltese was a puppy, he was scared of all the loud noises it made when the food was clinking around inside. But, I'm sure that other dogs would be interested in it. My friend came over with her dog and her dog couldn't stop playing with it. She finally asked me about it and I gave it to her, since my dog was scared of the Buster cube. Even though my dog didn't like it, I think this is a great product and must be very useful to other dog owners. If your dog is timid, then I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,It SOUNDED like a good idea...,"My vet recommended this toy for my dog Koko (terrier mix) b/c it would keep her distracted and away from destroying my things. I filled it with the dry dog food that she likes and showed her how to play with it, but she won't have anything to do with it! I tried chopping up a treat that she likes and using that, but it didn't get her interest either. Maybe it's just my dog, but I was dissappointed. I highly recommend getting your dog a Kong toy though, she never lets that thing go!"
2,Destroyed in no time!,I think the concept is great but my Weimaraner destroyed it the first day! He pulled out the plug and chewed it up! He swallowed pieces and ended up vomiting. So I had quite the mess to clean up! I was hoping it would last a bit longer and keep him occupied while I was at work. I wanted a refund or to exchange for a different item but the company would only replace it! Which doesn't help! So now he can only play with it while i am sitting with him and watching him. So don't get it if your pup likes to chew at all.
3,My puppy opens it...,"My 7 months puppy somehow manages to twist open it(how!?!?!), eat all the treats and destroys the divider. The purpose that we bought it is to relieve his separation anxiety, but what is the point if it needs to be played under supervision? But it surely gets his attention from scrubbing on the wall or carpet."
3,Not for strong chewers,"I bought this for my son's dog which is a bull terrier mix. Altho it only lasted two weeks before she chewed it up, it did keep her entertained while it lasted. I would suggest either heavier material or notification on the package about not good for strong chewers."
2,To hard to clean.,"IT is hard to get this clean. You can soak it, but then it's hard to get it dry. Since it is plastic, I don't want to put it in the oven. Also my dogs (Blue heeler mix, Miniature poodle/cocker mix) don't enjoy it was much as the Kong toy. I think that's because the Kong's movements are wobbly and more erratic--more like prey. This cube just clunks over and they lose interest."
4,"Use it for dinner time, fully engaged and learning!","After reading a bit more about toys that encourage learning and rewards, I came across a TON of reviews for this. At first I wasn't too sure if it was something my puppy would like, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I filled it up with his dinner, and placed it on the ground. I could tell he knew there was food in there because he was smelling it like crazy. He then accidentally knocked it over and some food fell out...... suddenly he realized....if i play i get treats! Normally when I feed him dinner it takes him less than 1 minute or two to woof it down, then he lets out a little burp. Sometimes he even managed to throw up a bit after because I noticed he wasn't even chewing. Well, it took him literally 25 minutes to get through a whole dinner with this. He got a bit frustrated as it was nearing it's last few kibbles, but I think he understands the concept now. Highly recommended! (my pup is a 6month old shihpoo, 10lbs)"
4,Recommended for agressive chewers or large breeds,This is a great product for keeping the pup busy for a bit- it is made of hard plastic and holds up well to rough play. The only down side is you may want to have your pet play with the cube on a carpeted area-it's noisy!
3,Not recommended if you have 2 dogs,I got the adult and puppy buster cube for my dogs. One of the dogs does all the work while the other dog follows him around eating the kibble that falls out. I think its a great concept if you have one dog.
5,Dog loves this thing,"There's not a whole lot to say about this toy. It's simple, and does what it's designed to do. My wife had a little trouble figuring out how to open it, but she has trouble opening the front door. Once you get past that small hurdle, you put food in it and close it; simple. But the dog loves it and gets about an hours worth of play kicking this thing around in order to get the treats. She likes it far more than any of the other food/toys that we have. Great investment."
2,Mini cube....outch!,"The Buster Cube and the Mini Cube is a great idea! The problem is that I almost broke all of my ten fingers, trying to get the inner cylinder out (for cleaning purpose). I let several people try it, because I thought there might be a trick...none of them was successful! I even went to Petsmart where they sell that toy. Needless to say that nobody there was successful as well. I ended up sending it back and putting some ice on my hurt fingers!!! 2 Stars for the idea..."
3,Dog toy,"Smaller than I thought, hard plastic, not good for chewers.might be better for small dogs, I have a sheltie and a doberman. Wouldn't recommend it for either."
1,A waste of money,Could not remove the centre to load treats. Ruby knocked it around a little but as no treats inside it was not really very interesting.
2,My Dog Ignores this Toy,"I am pleased with the fact that this toy is very sturdy, but it doesn't matter because my American Bulldog refuses to play with it. In addition to this, the openings are very large and the kibble falls out too easily. Yes, I did adjust the hole size, but that didn't help. It doesn't matter though, because my dog doesn't play with it."
4,Seemed good,"But, our dog didn't really get into it. Who knows why. Other than that, it shipped fine, worked fine, etc, etc."
4,Great,"Bit loud on the tiles and due to the opening size there is only a few treats other than kibble we can put in. Hours of noisy entertainment for my smart Miniature Pinscher who finds a normal treat ball a little too easy. I also couldn't get the holes to open to adjust the difficulty, had to get someone else to figure it out and have not tried to adjust it since. Would not recommend for soft food as it's hard to get out and can easily get stuck."
3,noisy,"the concept of the buster cube is great, it makes getting food fun for the dog. the only, yet very significant problem is that if you use it on hard floors it makes a ton of noise that's pretty much unbearable. and if you use it on a carpet it leaves crumbs. there are other products identical to the buster cube's purpose in dispensing food that way that are made of rubber."
3,Dog Cube,"I like the food cube except it's not as indestructible as I had hoped. I have four dogs and I bought this toy to see if I could curb my lab mix from her destructiveness due to mild separation anxiety. Well, one of the other dogs figured it out first and taught her, the only problem is that the other dog also figured out how to pick the cube up to get it out of corners and this broke one of the plastic tabs inside that help you screw on and off the lid by pick it up with one canine in the hole and the other on the outside edge of the cube. My 40lb dog broke the tab so what's going to happen if I were to let the 100 pounder play with it? Thought this would be more like a Kong and less like rawhide that is easily destroyed."
3,"Has potential, but my dog just didn't get it","I bought the Buster Food Cube to hopefully help with my Spaniel Mix's bad habit of woofing down her meals in a couple of seconds. I got the cube and was anxious to fill it up, however, it took a while to fill it. Once it was filled, I put it on the floor and kicked it around for her to help her figure out what she needs to do. She ate the kibbles as they fell, but unfortunately she's not the brightest dog ever so all she did was lick the hole where the kibble falls out and has to be put in to fill. I think she successfully knocked it over once or twice, but gave up shortly after that.I think overall the Buster Food Cube has potential to be a good product for a smarter dog. As for me, I'll just have to keep looking for solutions."
4,Great for active dogs,"I got this cube after my vet recommended it. I have a border collie Alaskan husky puppy. Both breeds are high energy, so she is very active. My vet said that this toy will help with mental stimulation. My puppy loves it. The minute she sees it in our hands she gets all excited. When we put food in it and shake it she goes nuts. One thing that is really nice about this is that you can make it harder. I think this is a great toy, and my puppy uses almost every single day."
3,Food falls out very quickly,"We use dog food in here...but it all falls out of the hole pretty quickly! I'm not sure if there are certain kinds of treats that would work better in here, but it does not work as well as i thought it would. Although, when it is empty, my dog likes to play around with it. So I guess it entertains him and that's always good! (6 mo. old yellow lab)"
4,Good but not great,"The first time I gave the cube to my puppy to play, she just kept looking at it. She didn't want to play. I left full of treats on the ground. The next day, she decided to play. She loved it. She played for a long time. The problem is, after few days, she can get all the treats out in only few minutes. It's a good toy, but not challenging enough. I wish it had more options to make it harder for her. She stills enjoys playing with it, but for a shorter amount of time."
2,Can be a hazard,"I bought a small buster cube for my 15lb furry mutt and he had a great time....until the inner cylinder popped off and the bottom half of his mouth got stuck in the hole. I was able to pry it off after he stopped yelping but it'd cut up his lip quite a bit. Oh, and this was his first time playing with the toy."
4,"Dog's Favorite, but noisy.","This is by far my dogs favorite toy. It holds a fair amount of food, and is easy to use. I don't think my dog has the ability to break toys, so this is a non-issue. Keeps the dog busy for 15-30+ minutes.My only complaint with it is that on wood floors it is VERY VERY noisy. Personally I wish this had a rubber coating, but it does not."
5,Finally a toy my dog can't break,"I have a very destructive dog. She is an American Eskimo and is far too intelligent for normal toys. They bore her or she destroys them, generally within minutes. Other treat dispenser toys, including the standard Kong, are too easy for her. Enter, the Buster Cube. I was recommended this toy from a local trainer who has had great luck with it. For my dog, this is not a very difficult toy to figure out, although compared to other toys she has had, this has taken considerably longer for her to master. About 2 days in, she's able to flip the cube on soft carpet and turn it successfully until all of the food we put inside of it is gone.We enjoy feeding her meals with the cube, as it helps stimulate her mind, keeps her occupied, and feeds her all at the same time. This is also one of the first toys that she can't just pick up, chew, crack, shred, or decapitate. I love this and have suggested it to several other pet owners."
3,"Good for a while, maybe better for smaller dogs","This is a pretty good idea, but might be better for smaller dogs. It's easy enough to pull out the middle and put food in, and it definitely kept my dog entertained. Food doesn't come out too easily, so he has to work for it.Unfortunately it didn't last all that long. My dog (~50lb pit) figured out how to pick it up by using the hole in the middle as a grip. He eventually did this enough that the middle piece started to crack and bulge out. Eventually it got hard to remove and replace the middle piece. Now I can't even lock the middle piece in, so it's useless. This thing is also pretty loud on any kind of surface other than a carpet.I would recommend for smaller dogs who won't be able to grip it by the center hole."
3,Good while it lasted,This is a good toy to keep your dog busy. However a little hard to get the opening loose to put the treats in. But then once you have the treats it keeps her busy (cairn terrier). Just make sure you put the lid/insert back in really good and tighten it. My dog got it loose and pulled it out and then chewed up the insert...which then leaves the ball part with no way to close it. SO just make sure the little plug thing is tight.
2,UPDATED: Pup loves it...but he managed to break it,"I picked up the Buster Cube after reading some positive reviews on it. Its a great toy, lots of fun and holds their attention for a long time. I put a handfull of kibble in it(an amount that my pup would eat in a couple bites) and he was occupied for at least a 30-45 minutes. I would 5 star it but it is its very noisy, even on carpeted floor, thats my only complaint.Update: The buster cube didn't make it through the weekend. My dog was able to remove the center piece, and then proceeded to chew on it while i was out of the room. Luckily I was only gone for a couple minutes and the center piece is still sort of functional. disappointing."
5,Great food toy!,"My terrier chases it all around the house. He finally gets tired - a good thing! The cap can be adjusted for the size of the treats, and how fast you want your dog to get the treats. If at the ""easiest"" setting, my terrier finds a way to remove the cap. For aggressive hunters I suggest keeping the cap at the tightest setting."
5,Great puppy entertainment,"This is one of the best puppy entertainment toys that I have ever bought. I have a 7 lb. mini Dachshund who loves this toy. She will run & get it & drop it at my feet & sit looking at me until I put the treats in it. She will then play with it for a long time even after the treats are gone. The treats I use in it are Old Mother Hubbard ""Bitz"". They are the perfect size for the mini cube."
1,BLOOD EVERYWHERE! BEWARE - NOT SAFE!!!!!,"I was in the same room with my schnauzer when he suddenly went nuts and there was blood everywhere! the middle insert came out and he got his teeth caught in the cube trying to get to the food. NOT SAFE! he was hitting everything in his path and it took a few minutes to calm him enough to lower his head and get his teeth out of it. We won't use THAT again EVERIt is also VERY difficult to put the food into, you need good finger dexterity to accomplish that feat. This was truly a waste of money.This deserves a ZERO star."
1,not what i wanted,"I returned this. I was excited to get it, but did not expect it to be the hard brittle type plastic. I decided it wasn't what I was looking for. It didn't look like it would last. Of course I didn't really give it a try."
2,There are other poducts that are better.,"My lab loves to play with various treat balls, but I don't recommend this one. It does not easily roll and play time gets ruff with my dog pawing at the cube and picking it up and tossing it. In the process the ""plug"" comes out and all the treats follow. The plug also then becomes a choking hazard if you have a chewer. There are other options that provide a better experience."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the cube. It is almost impossible to open. Finally I used the handle of a pair of pliers, after seeing a video on youtube, and I tore up the handle of the pliers opening it, it was that hard. The kibble either doesn't come out, and my dog gets frustrated and barks, or it comes out 5 pieces at once, and I have to refill it all the time. It also slides along the ground more often than it rolls over to dispense kibble. Maybe that's because my dog is too small to roll it? He's 6 pounds.One more thing, the instructions both on the product and Buster Cube's website refer to ""min"" and ""max"" settings. There is no such thing on the cube, only ""lock"" and ""unlock"" settings.My dog loves it though, so it gets 3 stars."
2,Cube material too hard,"This cube is the right shape, and dispenses treats wonderfully. However, my wrestless herding dog, who is very smart, does not enjoy the difficulty in getting the hard plastic cube to ""turn over"" and give her a treat. I'm disappointed because I hoped this toy would help some of her boredom during the day while I work. If the plastic were softer or there were more outlets that dispense treats she might go for it. Otherwise I don't recommend this for at least the Sheltie breed."
4,Great toy but poor design,"I got this toy for my puppy and he LOVES it. I agree with other reviewers that it is a 'must have' toy. However, the inner cylinder pops out occasionally on our tile floor It works better for him outdoors. It is also a bit difficult to load and adjust. I am very satisfied, overall, with the product because it keeps him entertained."
4,Buster Food Cube,"We have been using this food cube for a few years and our black lab really likes the challenge. It fits about 1.5 - 2 cups of food and usually takes about 5-10 minutes for our dog to get it all out.Pros:Keeps him engaged and makes him earn his food.Very durable design. Make sure your dog knows not to chew on the opening to get the food, but rather push it around.Cons:It is a little loud with all the food rattling around.Crumbs get into the carpet (vs feeding out of a bowl). We usually make him use it on tile flooring (louder).It is tough to load. We have been measuring the food into a cheap rubbermaid plastic bottle, and then shaking it through the mouth of the bottle into the cube.I would like it to take longer to get the food out...It was a good purchase, but would need to be easier to load to get 5 stars."
2,Scared our dog,"We fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day. Some of the toys he loved, but this one scared him. The plastic is think and hard, so when he would roll it from side to side it made a loud noise from the impact on our hard floors.I think it would work better with carpeted homes. Also, it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out, so I would say this is an 'advanced' toy."
4,LOUD but entertaining,"The buster cube keeps my lab puppy busy, but it is so loud on hardwood floors that you can't carry on a conversation in the same room."
4,Great but Noisy,"This is definitely a step up from the IQ ball as far as the level of difficulty. My Border Collie was very frustrated by it for the first few week, so he barked at it incessantly! Now he has fun with it, and it keep him busy, giving him a ""job"" to do. I really wish this were made of a hard rubbery material like the Kong toys, as the hard plastic makes it very noisy when my dog knocks it around on the hardwood floors, trying to get the treats out. Consequently, I can't let him play with it while I'm teaching piano lessons!"
4,"Good product, just not right for me","I bought the mini size buster cube thinking it would work for my little mutt (15lb beagle/pom mix) since I had seen other reviews mentioning how much their small breed dogs loved it. Maybe it works better in a home with carpeting, but it turned out that it was too large for my little girl (who is insanely food-motivated)to flip over easily on a consistent basis (the flooring is too slick so when she put her paw on it to flip it over, it just skidded around). She ended up batting it all over my hardwood floors like her old twist-n-treat toy , and was decidedly frustrated that she couldn't get anything out. It's also much too big for her to carry around in her mouth (and she'll carry/chew just about anything she can get her teeth on).It's a great idea, and a great product...I just wish it came in a smaller size (and was easier to access for cleaning). We'll be trying a puzzle ball next."
1,BEWARE! Dangerous to Dogs,"We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel. He loved it. One day he got his canine tooth stuck in the round insert. He immediately began howling in pain. He was howling so loudly while my husband and I safely detached it. I have never heard my dog cry this way before, or since then. We immediately threw away the cube. By the way, the cube was not damaged when it caught his canine tooth. It was a freak occurrence, but one we would never chance again. We were lucky."
4,Great interactive toy for dog,"This keeps my dog busy for at least 20 mins. She loves it. I would give it 5 stars, but the pin in the middle sometimes falls out, if you're not really careful closing it up. With my dog that means she chews it up. :("
3,Study of first half of Mark,"This book is a guided Bible study of the first half of the gospel of Mark. I would not reccommend it to the adult audience, but it is appropriate for middle and high-school students. The book is an examination of Jesus' life.I have met Chris Buda personally, and he is a very passionate man after God and an excellent speaker."
2,What a disappointment!,"When I saw the cover with Rose's biker chick alter ego, I bought it thinking that ALL the strips were going to be of Vicki. I was so disappointed. Maybe I didn't read the description well enough. When it arrived, I started reading and then it struck me -- these are just random strips, hardly any of Vicki at all."
1,Singing fo Satan,"Miss Roca has an OK voice but chica just made news for getting 666 tattoed on her in support for her cult leader who proclaims he is the anti-christ she also boast she gives up to 40% of her to her leader,just so you know where your money is going.Some angel!"
3,Who is this written for?,"There's some good information here. However, it often reads more like a manual for therapists than a guide for the average reader.Suspect the author was speaking to both audiences but it sometimes just doesn't work."
2,Needs a re-write,"My therapist recommended I buy this book, but warned me that it's terribly written. There are wonderful ideas in the book, but it's like sifting through a litterbox for the occasional golden nugget. I would really like to see an effort to repackage these ideas. A book for therapists and a companion workbook for clients would be great, something like the dialectical behavior therapists have created."
2,"Liked how it worked, but it broke after 6 months of ave. use","This hair dryer was used lightly each morning on a flat top hair cut. I have no complaints about how it worked, but it broke for no apparent reason about 6 months after I gave it to my husband as a gift. In the middle of the night, the plug started sparking and had to be removed from the outlet. Now the red reset button no longer clicks in. Seems like a safety issue to me, so I'm tossing it."
2,Rather poor quality,"I purchased one of these hair dryers and used it off and on for 2 months before the switch, which controls the off-low-high setting, started to slip internally. Now, I can only use the low setting on this hair dryer, which takes forever to dry my hair."
3,A Good Book.....For long nights,"This book is not at all like Panzer Aces I. I had no problem putting the book down. I couldn't believe the editorial mistakes and the spelling of ""Diesel"" Althru the book it mispelled diesel, it drove me crazy. The book at times got long winded, as if the editor was short of pages. I thought Infrantry Aces, Panzer Aces and Luftwaffe Aces were exceptional work of Franz Kurowski. But this book was a little disapointing. For for the price, it's well worth it. I paid a fortune thru Fedorowicz. I just wish Amazon would put more books for sale by Franz Kurowski"
1,Sconcerto=Awful!!!!,"Hi all there. Well, I must say that I'm a great and very big fan of Mina, that's why is dissapointing for me to say that: Sconcerto is the worst CD of Mina. I don't know another Mina's CD that is so ugly!I really love Mina, but the only ""good"" song of this CD is ""la lontananza"", and I'm not going to buy a CD to hear only 1 song...Of course, there is no doubt that Mina is the most beautiful singer in the whole entire world, but Sconcerto is really awful!! Did you hear Mina's ""Volare"" version??? Is very dissapointing!! ""Volare""(Nel blù, dipinto di blù) is a funny song, but Mina really makes it horrible!! A song that has a fast rhythm, she plays it with a piano!!!So, if I were you, I would think about buying this CD twice...Thanks for reading my opinion!Lautaro."
3,OK overall; DVD player frustrating,"I wanted an inexpensive, quality DVD/VCR combo, and this has been a pretty good unit overall. The one major frustration has been it plays new DVDs fine, but any DVD we get from a video store or library (in other words, DVDs in less than perfect condition) it freezes up and all we can do is stop the DVD and start all over again. If this unit had error correction on the DVD player, it would be a great value."

2,"A bit too basic, outdated and expensive","I learned a few new things from this little guide, but nothing terribly new or more powerful or anything (that I couldn't find elsewhere online, for free). Five bucks is too steep for a twelve-page .pdf that's several years old now (when it was two bucks)."
4,Good not great,"How to Use Google : The 30 Most Important Tips, Hacks and Tricksis a good reference on google, but there are those that are much better."
4,Google High Speed Tutorial,"Worth the money to obtain a sense of competence with this all powerful, by all accounts, search engine. There is some slight digression and loss of focus on page 10. Nonetheless, it is nice to be rid of ignorance and its corollary, helplessness, quickly and cheaply."
1,Sacred Stone,"I was not happy with this purchase. I went into this expecting to receive a Publisher hardcopy with dust jacket. I did receive a hard copy, but it was one where the book title was printed on the cover. Not a dust jacket and not a publisher hard copy. Can sellers please differentiate the hard copy they are selling from the others available!!"
4,Good Light Reading,"I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews on this book. I'm not a Clive Cussler fan normally, maybe that's why I like this book a lot more than the usual Cussler formula. I agree with a lot of the reviewers that this book most likely is not written by Cussler, but by his co-author.The book is completely illogical, of course - the events could never take place in the real world, but I thought that the appeal of a book like this is to take your mind off the real world. If I want literature, I'll read Dostoevsky. If I want really light, fluffy reading with no mental calories, I will read Cussler, Crichton, or God forbid, Tom Clancy.I've been very critical of several other Cussler books, and this one is really not much better. Having said that, I think the book is entertaining. Maybe I've just learned that a Cussler book is not to be confused with anything other than a pleasant diversion (apologies to the true fans)."
4,very good,"I have read every book Cussler has in print. I thought this was as good as the others. Exciting from the beginning to the end. There are different main characters than readers are used to, and maybe that is why some of the bad reviews. The book is different, but very good. I enjoyed it and look forward to the next in the series."
2,not one of best i have read!,did not flow at all. had a hard time getting through the book. normally i can read it in two days or less. this took me a week.
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!,"I have read all of Cussler's books and have liked them all to various degrees. This book is a real bore. The characters have no personality (but, you know every move they make and everything that they eat). I kept thinking that it would get better so I finished it, sadly."
1,"Boring, confusing and slapdash",I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books. The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end. The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve.
2,Underwhelming,"While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight. There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book). This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe. The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion. Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well. Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming."
1,Sacred Stone,"How Cussler could lend his name to this worthless ""novel"" is a mystery to me. No suspense, no character development, disjointed editing, predictable plot add up to an absolute snoozer. I finished it out of incredulity that it could get progressively worse, but it did.I have read everything else Cussler has written, but am now going to be on guard for these "" name cash cows"".Avoid this one."
1,Did Clive Cussler even READ this book??,"Mr. Cussler, please don't lend your revered name to such poorly written stuff as ""The Oregon File"" series. Your name on the cover, and your pic on the back may sell books to your loyal fans, but will quickly destroy our faith."
1,Dragged on and on,"I am a huge fan of Cussler. I thought I was buying a Cussler book. I was wrong. The writing style is entirely different and incredibly boring. As one reader mentioned, almost every chapter ends with sentences like: ""His plan was to make the delivery, then locate a doctor. He had no way of knowing the next doctor he'd see would be a coroner,"" or ""The meeting broke up...he would grab a few hours sleep. He had no way of knowing that this sleep would be his last until the big one."" Ugh... they were so irritating that I found myself getting actually angry at this book. Halfway through it I put it down to go read the new paperbacks by Lincoln Child and Matthew Reilly, and then I came back to finish it. I have NEVER put down a Cussler before. I'm fine with the break from tradition (Dirk Pitt, ships, fun cars), but not from Clive's traditional break-neck action, drama and detail. I'm dreading reading any more Oregon Files."
1,I can write this,"I started this book 4 weeks ago and today I just gave up. Very weak. No fun and I think this was just written to make money. With the books that have been out before, you would think they would try.....well, will see what the Pitt book is all about, but if its like this I am done with the series. Have them all and love them....just not this one.PS Golden Budda rocked"
3,Not very interesting,"I certainly did not enjoy this book as much as all of the other's of Cussler that I've read. There were too many characters involved and, because of that, it didn't personalize any of them to the reader. I was disappointed as I have enjoyed all of his other books...just not this one."
1,Waste of Time,"I have been listening to the book and been very disappointed.I am having difficulty getting past the narrator who assigns silly laughable voices to many of the characters.I will definately ensure that I do not listen to anything he reads in future.Now the story itself. I had thought that I was having difficulty following the characters and plot due to the bad reader.However, reading some of the other reviews I have to agree with most of them.The story is fragmented, has too many characters to follow and there are many instances that are laughably unbelievable.I will be careful in future when picking a Cussler book with a co-auther"
1,Exit Craig Dirgo enter Jack DeBrul,"Not a very interesting read at all, Dirgo frankly does not get Cusslers style of writing and plot devices. Since I read this book back to back with 2 other Jack DeBrul co-written books I can honestly say its lucky that I read ""Sacred Stone"" 1st otherwise I may not have even opened the cover."
2,"Disappointing Cussler -- tell me it ain't so, Clive","First Cussler novel I've ever given up on (half-way through). Hadn't been able to stop turning the pages of any of his previous efforts (and I've read them all), but this one was just too scattered/disjointed and had too little character development. Sadly disappointing."
1,NEVER AGAIN!!!! This is not even close to Cussler!!!,"I have read most of the *real* Cussler novels and am a huge fan. I read one previous Dirgo book (and hated it): I thought I would try again, but I couldn't even finish Sacred Stone!!! The characters have NO depth, the plot has huge holes, and the writing style is amateur. Sorry Craig, but with Cussler's name on the book the bar is set pretty high - and at this point in your career you're no Clive.It appears that Clive maybe consults on the storyboard of these new ""co-authored"" books, but then steps away. It is a shame, but these books will never satisfy a Cussler fan."
2,Characters have not one drop of personality,"I am a huge fan of Clive Cussler. His books draw readers into both the plot and the characters. Yes, this book is action packed so it took me awhile to figure out what was missing - personality. There is no chemistry between the characters nor any attempt to create any. Not one description of thought or feeling or sign of life out side the mission. These could have been robots - the Terminator showed more emotion. And did I need to be told at the end of so many chapters that the person was about to die? ""He had no way of knowing that this sleep would be his last until the big one."" If you have to explain it to me that clearly then the story is not doing its job."
1,Don't read what the subcontractor wrote,"I have read all the novels in the Dirk Pitt and Kirt Austin series and enjoyed most of them. This is the first, and last, of the Oregon Files series that I will ever read. Cussler subcontracted this novel out to Craig Dirgo and it is terrible. Most Cussler plots are far fetched, but at least you could believe that Dirk and company could save the day. This group called ""The Corporation"" is so far over the top that the author makes them seem like the only competent people in the entire intelligence or counterterrorism community on the planet. Do yourself a favor and pass by any novel that Cussler subcontracts and instead reread the Dirk Pitt series."
1,Don't waste your money...,"Don't waste your money on this book. I am currently reading it (two-thirds of the way through the book). I am having such a difficult time getting through it that I thought I would check out some customer reviews to see if anyone else felt the same way. Well, lo' and behold... I'm not the only one! This book has way too many characters, too many subplots, is very difficult to follow, and it is boring. It tries to be thrilling and exciting, but it is NOT. Having read the other readers' reviews, I have decided not to waste any more of my time finishing the book. I may skim through the last 50 pages just to see how it ends, but I'm not going to spend any more hours ""drudging"" through one disappointing chapter after another."
1,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this one. Maybe it would be a good movie, but it isn't a good read. The characters are flat and the adventure is not believable."
3,A little of this and a little of that ...,"Take a radioactive meteorite hidden away by Vikings in Greenland. Add to that a crazed Islamic extremist bent on a London based nuclear explosion. Garnish it with a misguided, grieving businessman who has lost his son to Islamic fascism. Add it all together and you have another ""Clive Cussler"" novel.Writing with (or really by) Craig Dirgo, ""Sacred Stone"" is a fast paced romp across the globe as the men of the ""Company"", to wit the owners of the ""Oregon""....try once again to save to save the world.Can they do it? Or does the world finally come to an end? You will have to read it to find out. Ahem, or not.Anyway, it was a good read. Not a great read. A fun read. Not a spine tingling read. Nevertheless, it is everything that you might expect from the proclivity of the pen(s) of Clive Cussler and friends.Densel MyersYukon, Oklahoma"
3,Sacred Stone,Lacks some of the new Oregon Files action and character..OK but you can tell it was an earlier book.
1,Cussler's first stinker,"Sacred Stone is the seventh Clive Cussler novel I've read and the third in his Oregon Files series and I can say without qualification, it's a stinker!Though based on an interesting premise, the author cheats often and shamelessly, asking the reader to ignore obvious plot holes and suspend belief in even the most basic of assumptions.I found myself preferring a quick game of FreeCell to finishing this snoozer. Too bad. I've had such a great time reading Cussler so far.Between managing 3 fiction series, his non-fiction works, movies, and NUMA, Cussler has spread himself too thin. At least Sacred Stone is forgettable!"
4,"Not great, but still pretty good.","Sacred Stone isn't one of my favorite Cussler novels, but it is still well worth reading. I didn't feel the character development was up to his usual standards, but the plot was still excellent and enough to keep me turning pages. I recommend it."
3,Plenty of food onboard.,"I am reading the Oregon files out of order, making it all the more fun for me. Here are some quick observations: The best of the bunch, hands down, is ""Plague Ship""; in that novel, Juan Cabrillo's prosthetic limb is mentioned more than once, and yet there's no mention of it in ""Sacred Stone""; there are way too many characters in these books to effectively keep track of even with the lists at the beginning; and finally, the crew of the Oregon never stops eating. I think there's at least one reference to food on every page.""Sacred Stone"" is a terrific summer read. It's not literature or even what I would call hard fiction. It's like a movie-matinee experience."
2,This short book is too long!,Here it is .. short and sweet. The end of all the main story lines come to an end aprox. 35 pages before the book does! If you're around long enough to follow the myriad of plot points and countless main characters through to the end you'll just be more frustrated then satisfied. Would someone get Mr. Cussler out of his classic car garage and back in the saddle again? It's too obvious!
3,"Better than Buddha, but...","After reading this Oregon Files adventure, I feel more comfortable with the writing, but can not say it is the easiest to follow. I enjoyed this book as much as Golden Buddha if not more as I be come more familiar with all the characters involved. Good change of pace from the Pitt series, not that it is boring."
2,Boring - Boring -,"I found this audiobook to be very dull and boring. The only highlight was the change in ""tone"" when there was a telephone call. The story was predictable and the reader was flat and monotone, I couldn't tell the difference between the male and female characters and the accents were dreadful. I will not be listening to, or reading any others in the series."
2,"Fair, very fair","This is only my second book from Cussler - the first one I enjoyed ""Golden Buddha"" but this novel was tough to get through. Spoilers: Everything goes right. Is there ever a single scene where the Corporation has a problem/issue/event that fails. Not in this book!I will definitely read the next one in the series ""Dark Watch"" and hope for the best."
2,Disappointing!,"I have read most of Clive Cussler's novels, but I did not think this was one of his better ones. It is different from his other novels, as it is not a one man show like Dirk Pitt or Kurt Austin, but a group known as the 'Corporation', who have to save the world from the bad guys. I guess this makes the story a bit more believable.In this case there are two sets of bad guys. Islamic fundamentalists, who wish to blow up London, and a businessman, who wants to destroy Mecca. Both are trying to get their hands on an ancient piece of Meteorite, that will help with their plans.I found the book a bit monotonous in places, something that rarely happens in this author's other books, and a bit of a struggle at times. I felt there was way too many characters involved. I would not say the book was awful, but it is definitely not as good as the author's earlier works.If you are new to Clive Cussler, I would recommend, Sahara, Treasure or Dragon as good reads."
4,Levi keeps the ASO on their toes,"Good interpretation of this standard work, the ASO plays with intent and energy in this sometimes relentless piece. Levi lets the sound get a little heavy for my taste at times, particularly in the finale, but overall a good choice if this is your first purchase of this recording."
2,Re-labelled 1960's Marketing. New only to the dumb young.,"This and the author's other book ""In The Tornado,"" are benign in that they say nothing that hasn't been said for 40 years by others. They ARE potentially harmful if they're taken seriously and without question by the young reader. Older, wiser, more experienced marketers will find the books humorous and they will be amused by the way good marketing can sell even a mediocre product."
2,"See my review of author's ""Inside the Tornado."" Same stuff.","I've re-read this book. My original two-star review is beginning to look generous. Read my review of the author's other book, ""Inside the Tornado,"" and you'll have my review for this book. They're exactly the same. Even after the second reading. (Save your time and don't read this book twice.)"
2,Hire a Proofreader,"Very good content but the worst grammar I've ever seen in a book, much less a best-selling business book. Obviously relied on a spell-checker and then rushed into print. No excuse for such a poor job on a revised edition. I could not in good conscience recommend this edition to anyone."
4,This is a great book,This is a great book which is easy to read and which contains a lot of usefull information
3,Good ideas---poor product,"Moore has to be outraged at the misspellings, typos, forgotten lines and misprints in the revised edition. The continuous publication errors make this book tough to read. What a travesty of quality control on the part of the publisher. If you get annoyed at paying money for a thin paperback with more errors than information, stay away from this one. It's sloppy, lightweight and overhyped."
3,Spell Check Doesn't Cut It,"Crossing the Chasm is a great book. However, it is painfully obvious that HarperCollins didn't hire any proofreaders for the final copy. It's like they ran it through Microsoft Word and looked for red squigglies... A bad case of ""if its [sic] spelled correctly, it mast [sic] be write [sic]"" Right?"
2,Classical marketing in high-tech clothing,"There is nothing new in ""Crossing the Chasm"" that hasn't been covered in the oldest marketing textbooks. But the very fact that Moore has managed to make this a bestseller shows that he knows how to exploit the mainstream ignorance on the subject by dressing it up in a ""Silicon Valley"" costume. The biggest fallacy -- which he acknowledges in the very beginning -- is that none of his hypotheses are actually supported by any data. And without data, these hypotheses can be called, at best, weak. For instance, in a current corporate buying environment where decisions are made by a multitude of people (and hence personalities and buying ""profiles""), the classification of the buyer under a single model (like pragmatist, etc.) just doesn't hold. If you like to read a novel, Chrossing the Chasm may appeal to you. If you like good, solid, cutting edge marketing information, look elsewhere."
3,"Good book about IT Marketing, but I expected more","I enjoyed the book. However, it is 100% focused in the IT industry (leaving other areas of high tech out of the scope) and cases are also 100% focused in the USA. He uses a lot of references to North American pop persons ( TV, sports, etc ), which makes his analogies useless for an international audience. It is easy to read and enjoyable."
4,Dream to Reality,"I attended a planning session at a Fortune 500 company that used the premise of this book to take us into reality. The concept is solid marketing and echoes the corporate or, perhaps, venture business axiom that ""we really loved this project when it was a dream!"" And, who doesn't? This book gives us all practical knowledge about how to take our businesses from that small, little known phase of early adopters and get on the mainstream engine by crossing the chasm between those of us who are destined to remain a small business to one in which we really grow and proper and make our dream a reality in the mainstream"
5,Must Read for Tech Execs,"If you have a Internet related job and in management, then read this book and Inside the Tornado. Then you'll understand HowTo make your company a success."
3,Too Many Typos!!,"The revised 1999 version has way too many typos! Definitely a ""show-stopper."" Geoff -- are you listening? Get rid of the typos!"
4,"Good ideas, about 100 pages too long",What it says about marketing new bleeding edge softwareproducts is right on the money with valid examples andcase histories. A little to heavy on the methodology andtoo lite on the entrepreneural and creativity side.
4,SCTV is back!,"This video brings back all the funny and zanny skits that only SCTV can provide. I love this tape, and would recomend it to anyone who was a fan of SCTV. I would have given it 5 stars, only if it was longer in length. END"
4,John Candy and cast on SCTV!,".....SCTV is without a doubt one of THE funniest show television has ever produced. My friends and I have spent countless hours reciting skit after skit. My tapes are all worn out and no longer viewable! The only other sitcom since SCTV worth watching over and over again is Sienfeld! When o when will SCTV come out on DVD?......By the way, BUY THIS TAPE!"
4,Johnny LaRue/ Street Beef,"There is sooo much MORE that should be released! I found it extremely hard to belive that this is the only video available! My GOD, THERE SHOULD BE VOLUMES AVAILABLE!"
4,One of the top films about the gangster's world in the Nineties!,"When the renegade gangster Dug Schultz yanks control, Bumpy Johnson decides to join forces with Lucky Luciano in order to exterminate that swagger. The cast is simply excellent and the violence sequences are high order status. Filled of vibrant realism apart of a suggestive narrative line beneath the script that genially supports it and even enriches it through the Opera world.Watch this cast: Laurence Fishburne, Andy Garcia and Tim Roth. Magisterial direction of Bill Duke."
5,Hoodlum Is Great,"I really love this move! I liked it from the very beginning. I would recommend this one to anyone, especially those that like gangster type movies. Great cast, and Laurence Fishburne did an excellent job in his portrayal of Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson."
3,"FABULOUS SETS, SPARKLING CAST, ORDINARY MOVIE.","Hoodlum's sets and costumes are fabulous, the production value is very high, and the movie really conjures up an idea of what life must have been like in 1930s Harlem. I'm no authority, but I wonder if this level ofbright sunlit freshness was an accurate depiction of Harlem.The movie gets gorier by the minute, until it draws to a very bloody end. Performances are not bad at all. Tim Roth - an actor I don't usually like - puts in a great performance as the psychotic-racist Dutch Schultz. Andy Garcia is excellent as Lucky Luciano. Vanessa Williams does her jig well. But the one performance that stands out is Fishburne's, very controlled and convincing.The movie is not original after the movies we have been exposed to (good man turns all selfish when he sees the world around him) but it's a pretty decent gangster flick nevertheless if you like this kind of stuff. There's plenty of action -- in all senses of the word."
4,Anybody see the irony?,"Oscar nominees, Fishbourne, Roth, and Garcia were nominated for an oscar for playing bad guys; Tim Roth for playing a ruthless royal rapist, Lawrence Fishbourne for playing an drug-addicted abusive husband, and Garcia for playing a power hungry gangster. Either way these three guys made this movie great."
2,Interesting Movie but not History,Great acting and action! Libeling Thomas Dewey ruined the movie for me. Thomas Dewey put mobsters in jail. He didn't take money from them and no evidence exists that he did. Hoodlum is a complete fabrication. I can't understand attacking the reputation of a good man. Disgusting.Also the role of Bumpy Johnson was overstated. He didn't have such power. Decent movie but absolutely rotten history.
1,Hoodlum: Disapointing From Start to Finish,"If the title of the article doesn't give away my sentiments towards this movie, than allow me to elaborate. Hoodlum, judging by it's cast and theatrical trailer had potential galore. All that changes when you realize that by deciding to watch Hoodlum,you have done yourself a great disfavor. Without going into too many details (consider that a favor!)the movie depicts the gangster world of Chicago in the 30's and the infamous 'lottery' system that those gangsters helped finance. The movie is not only over acted but it's epic length may induce commas or nausea for those with weak stomachs. Stars Lawrence Fichburn and Venessa Williams only lend so much credibility to this otherwhise cliched mess. An 'end of the world' story line was all that was missing to make this the ULTIMATE disasater movie of the 90's."
5,Keeping it Hood in Harlem,"Harlem is a great movie bar none. I love movies with substance, especially when you're talking about a real person as apposed to a fictional character. I must admit I knew nothing about Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson, but after watching the movie I felt like I knew him, that's how strong the potrayal was by Mr. Lawrence Fishbourne, a phenomenal actor in my opinion and I'm sure others. As far as gangster movies go, this should be right up there with Goodfellas, Scarface, and The Godfather. Cicely Tyson is a force to be reckoned with as well. I also love Andy Garcia..for him to wear that prostetic to make his eye look droopy had to be hard. Props to the entire cast. I would recommend this movie to anyone who's interested in seeing how it really was back in the 1930's. A must have in your movie collection."
5,Kinda the prelude to American Gangster,Excellent movie .. and if you watch this movie then go see American Gangster...it follows a path. In American Gangster Denzel's character is the hier to Bumpy Johnson who passes away early in the film.
5,Great Depression Gang Film,"If you haven't heard of Harlem gangster Bumpy Johnson, then you definitely need to see this movie. It starts of with Bumpy (played wonderfully by Laurence Fishburne) just being released from prison and on the streets of early 1930s Harlem. After his arrival he sees that notorious gangster Dutch Schutz (Tim Roth) has taken control of the numbers racket that once belonged to his boss Stephanie St. Claire (Cicily Tyson). After she is arrested, Bumpy then takes control of her operation and goes into a full-fledged war with with Schutz's crew for control of the numbers racket. After awhile, notorious mob boss Lucky Luciano steps in to calm things down but but by that time it's to late. The acting in this movie made me feel like I was right there in 1930's Harlem. It can go toe-to-toe with an of this mordern day Gangsta films."
2,"Performances save un-original ""Hoodlum""","Three great actors, Laurence Fishburn, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, are what keep this dull and awkward crime drama going. Watching Tim Roth potray the legendary evil Dutch Schultz is amazing. Larry Fishburn is also good as gangster Bumpy Johnson, one of Dutch's biggest rival's in the era in which this film takes place. And although Andy Garcia has a reletively small part, his performance as Lucky Luciano is probably the best offered of that character (at least from what I've seen). Other than that, this is probably the most boring gangster movie i've ever seen. Had it been at least half and hour shorter, it MIGHT have come out lookin' better, but alas, i did not. I wish I could give it Two and a half stars, I think that would be a little more fair, but I had to be fair to anyone curious about this movie, and give it ""2""."
4,"Handsome, Inside and Out","Not only is this book packaged in a handsome red and gold cover, the contents are rather intriguing. Well organized and informative, this book would have been a 5, except for a college student (like most books) it is pricey. A worthwhile addition to any collection."
1,RIP OFF,"Caution this product DOES NOT WORK.I repeat DOES NOT WORK.I can't even tell the difference in my dogs hair. Don't buy this at K-mart, if your planning on taking it back. We have tried to take it back, because it has a 12 month warranty and I have only had it for 3 days. THIS PRODUCT [IS WORTHLESS!!!]"
1,DONT BUY THIS!!,Its a nice packagea and the idea of being able to change irons but its too small and it pulls my hair. It takes to long to warm up. Its just a bad product. I dont recommend at all.
2,NO NO NO,This product was pretty bad in the sense that it straightens badly.....but the crimping plates worked well. The waving plates were way too shallow to make a difference to my hair. I have thicker hair and the straighening iron didn't effect my hair. The water resivoir ran out way too fast and the water would drip out and burn me. This product is only good for the crimper.
1,This product is bad news! Don't waste your money!,"I bought this product since I have both a Vidal Sassoon hair dryer and curling iron and they are both wonderful! However, this straightener is a HORRIBLE product and a complete waste of money. NOTHING is good about it, it just burns your hair and makes it frizzy. Also, the metal plates on the straighter are extremely small so even if it did work for your hair, you would spend forever working through your hair. Bottom line is don't buy this product, go for a ceramic straightener, they are great!"
1,LORDIE!,"This was a horrible product. I have straight hair and am always looking for something to spice things up- put in waves, and crimps. This product was horrible again- when I tried the straigtening attachment (my hair had a bit of a natural curl at the tips), the little ridges on the side pulled my hair out, and though I did not encounter a burn with the hot water, it certainly landed on my counter quite a few times. This is a crappy product and I would warn you against it. I don't understand why someone would make an iron that pulls your hair out- OUCH! get a clue."
3,Devotional Book,"Phillip Keller is one of my favorite authors. Having raised sheep myself for many years, his reflections relating one's relationship the Jesus, the good shepherd, to his experience as a herdsman is extremely accurate. My favorite book by Keller is ""A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23"". I thought that ""El Senior es mi Pastor"" was a Spanish translation, but it is strictly a devotional book - a very good one to be sure."
5,Nice solid performer,"Bought this drive to ferry files between home and work. Drive is solidly constructed, though weighs only 5 oz. and is smaller than my PDA. Writes/reads files on my USB2.0 home system 10 times faster than my USB1.1 office system -- really worth getting a USB2.0 card. Gets its power through USB cables and, as it comes with two cables, I have one at work and one at home -- I only need to transport drive. Comes with a nice, tight-fitting leather slip-cover. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Portable storage nirvana,"Bought the Storix 20 GB USB 2.0 portable hard drive and it works as advertised -- I am very happy with it. The best features are its small size and the fast throughput when using USB 2.0 ports, and no wall wart! This drive is USB powered. The drive is backward compatible with USB 1.1, and you'll obviously get hit with much lower throughput inherent with the old USB 1.1 specification.Bottom line, if your desktop PC does not have USB 2.0 ports and you have a free PCI slot, definitely buy a USB 2.0 port PCI card -- they are cheap and you'll love the extra speed USB 2.0 has to offer.I was thinking about buying an Iomega ZIP 750 until I saw this drive.Uses 2.5"" hard drive technology, so TLC is in order when using/transporting this drive.Great drive, great price. I finally have a great solution in this product for portable storage."
4,Getting closer to my cert,"I'm getting closer to my MCSA, thanks to Sybex. I liked this product, and think that you need to use this or something like it to pass the exams. I liked the simulations a lot, but would like to be able to configure more of them on my own. However, it did take me about 12 hours to get through all of the exercises included, so maybe I'm a glutton for punishment. The Active Directory simulation was cool."
3,Requirements to use virtual lab,"This lab complements the MCSE Study Guide set of books published by Sybex, 2nd edition. The book included with the disk only gives the directions for the exercises; to get the most out of the product you need the study guide for each section (70-210, 70-216...)to understand what is going on. The exercises are the same as in the study guides and most, though not all, labs in the books are presented. You can only do what is in the exercise in the simulation and cannot go off to see other options. Worth the money if you do not have access to a Windows 2000 Server."
1,don't waste your time,"This thing is a joke, forget it. I would strongly suggest that you acquire some spare systems to train yourself on. If you can't do that, try VMware Workstation and run a couple of virtual systems on one workstation.bottom line; if you can read a book don't bother with this software unless you think you will gain something by being pushed through some exercises."
4,Sassoon ionic hairdryers,"Read an advertisment about ionic hairdryers. Concept seemed like a good idea. It does dry my hair a bit quicker than a regular hairdryer and it does feel softer. My hair is thick and course, so I guess it works!"
1,Broke after 2nd use,"Although this hair dryer has a powerful drying effect, the high/low/off switch broke on my second use. Now it is permanently stuck on low. I would not recommend this dryer to anyone after experiencing this.... I must now send it back to the manufacturer for repair. What a pain!"
2,Worked for almost 2 months,"I purchased this blow dryer because I owned a vidal sassoon blow dryer before and it worked for many years. I did not use this blow dryer on a daily basis, so I am not sure what went wrong. But it was sounding sluggish and then started smokin'. I had thrown away my receipt because my first VS blow dryer worked for so long. I called the company and they said they will replace it if I send it to them. I am not sure if I am thrilled about using another one, but since I threw my receipt away, I guess I'll give it a try. When it did work, I liked it - that earned the first star. And because the company is willing to replace it without a receipt, I gave them a 2nd star. We'll see how it turns out."
4,from the hair drying queen....:),"Seriously, I know hairdryers. I blow dry my hair at least once a day, and have gone through endless amounts of hairdryers. This was the first ionic hairdryer that I have purchase as well. This dryer does dry my hair slightly quicker than other dryers, plus I can dry my hair on medium heat and low speed with the same amount of time that a normal high heat, high speed would do. It does leave my hair in slightly better condition (however this is because it is on lower heat.) But... the three heat settings are basically the same temperature (they don't vary too much...infact I can barely tell the difference) The cool shot is useless too due to the fact it is the same heat as the cool setting. but overall, if your buying it on amazon...it is a good dryer for the price your paying. Hope this helps."
1,Didn't last long...,"I bought the Vidal Sassoon VS781 and liked using it... while it was working. Unfortunately, after 10 weeks the hot air temperature dropped to warm air and never was capable of hot air again. Then two weeks later the whole motor overheated and nearly became a fire hazard. This hair dryer is now in the garbage. I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident or not, but it was convincing enough for me to never buy a Vidal Sassoon dryer ever again."
2,clumsy,"This is not one of the best hair dryers I've had. At best, it's average. The nozzle is too long, and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal. I like attachments that can rotate so that I can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair. The ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair. After using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths (about 3X a week), the switch for heat settings is now loose. The dryer only blows cool air even though I slide the switch for higher temperatures. My rating has gone from average to below average."
1,Good for 1 day!,"Just like a couple of the reviews I just read, this hair dryer was fantastic on the first day I used it. But guess what? On Day 2, the speed switch broke and it only has low speed. I could hear a broken piece inside the dryer and as I used it, it got caught in the motor. I shut it off and won't use it. Headed for the trash--what a waste of money!Apparently, this is far from an isolated incident; it's called poor quality!"
5,Use these as shot glasses too,I bought these for a friend and she was elated to add these to her collection.
5,Toothpick holder but more fun as a shot glass!,"I'm a huge Sally fanatic and even though it's a toothpick holder, I use it as a shot glass. It's about two good shots worth. I suppose I can use Jack for its intended use. Very nice.Also, don't know why in the review process, it's asking ""toy"" questions. Definitely not a toy."
1,Bad quality,"I was given this as a gift from our friends and we loved the look of them to add to our collection! However, there was nothing on the box that said NOT DISHWASHER SAFE but there really should have been because one go through our dishwasher caused the giant sticker that is the designs to peel off and now Jack has no head. :( We never even got to use them once. *sigh* If the product is going to be so badly made their packaging should show it!"
1,Let the buyer beware!,"The photo of this item implies that these are drink glasses. We were very surprised when the item arrived to discover that they are actually SHOT glasses! The description is NOT clear on this item. (2008 update: the description has been changed to say these are ""toothpick"" holders to imply their small size--I guess ""shot glasses"" is not cool to describe something for kids)."
4,good start to teaching science to little ones,I purchased this book because I will be homeschooling my 1st grader. We have not started the school year yet but I am excited to use it. This book is just a basic intro to different parts of science and most pages have a small/easy experiment to do to reinforce the idea. I particuarly liked this book also because it did not cover evolution and we are creationists. It did not cover creation either...but it did hit several other interesting parts of science.
5,"a modern-day, old-fashioned detective novel",I found this book very enjoyable. The plot had enough twists and surprises to keep it moving. The writing was fresh and yet familiar at the same time.
3,The Sewing Machine Murder,"I've heard other people say that they will read a book if the first line on the first page is catchy. With this book, it was the first line of the fifth paragraph on the first page, that I thought catchy. But no matter which line was catchy, this is a very delightful book, fast to read and full of colorful characters. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a light, fun, entertaining story."
1,Third rate Mike Hammer,This wantabe mystery is predictable and boring using cliches at every turn. Not new noir. Skip this read.
2,College student,I am a great student at college who loves school and I had to take a mandatory history class. I'm not good at history and do not like it but since I wanted a good grade in the class I had to read this book. This book was confusing to me and was not in a logical order. It kept jumping around from topic to topic in the first part of the book. It was too wordy and did not get to the important facts.
2,safari pin brush,This isn't what I remembered of the original safari pin brushes. The design is different they use the pins that have the pin heads on it insead of the original straight pins. I don't like this type of brush since the ends are what get tangled and pull the hair.
5,Lots of Memories!,I used to LOVE this movie as a kid! Now that I am 23 I still put it in my DVD player ever once in a while. MJ was one of the reasons I started playing basketball in the first place. This movie is still super cute and funny!
4,I loved this trilogy......,"I absolutely LOVED this trilogy. While I have read many of Nora Roberts books, I wasn't jumping to start reading this one immediately. I really didn't think I would like the whole premise of the stories, but a friend gave them to me, so I figure I would start book 1 and see if I liked it. I agree you kinda have to be ""in the mood"" to read this type of story, the fantasy etc, BUT I thought it was great. Loved Book 1 as it started the whole story, Loved Book 2 as you really got into alot of the details of the story behind the whole trilogy, BUT Book 3 I thought was FABULOUS. I too cried a few times and I don't think I ever have for a book, and I truly did not know how this was going to end........ Can't wait for more like it !!!"
2,one little line...,"I've read fantasy works by several others... Raymond Feist, Melanie Rawn, even Anne Rice ...and never did one simple sentence stop me in my tracks with the thought ""what in the world was he/she thinking?"". I refer to young boy vampire's thoughtful reference of riding his mother. Did that mean what I took it to mean? Alrighty-we're all of age, I assume, and could read between the lines that something was not healthy about that relationship. One might argue that we're talking vampires here -- what's healthy got to do with anything? That being said, I say--too much information.I too have read many of NR's works-way back to Montana Sky (?) and have much enjoyed many of those many, much. Yes there's predictability after, what-- 75 (?) books. But still at times a great plot or character or line pops up. I am disappointed and will probably let some time pass before puchasing another of her works."
5,Nora Robert Circle Trilogy Book 3,"Valley of Silence (The Circle Trilogy, Book 3). It arrived in excellent condition- I like the fast delivery.I'm a big fan of Nora Roberts' work."
5,Valley of Silence,All of Nora Roberts books are great. I don't think I have ever anything of hers that wasn't a must read. This triology is especially intriguing.
3,Predictable,"This is the final book of the ""Morrigan's Cross"" series by Nora Roberts which centers around a circle of six fighting for all mankind on Samhein.I read Morrigan's Cross and liked it, although I wasn't totally enthralled with it. The second book, Dance of the Gods, was better and had more humor in it but again, predictable. Third (this one) again, predictable and I knew the ending of it before I was finished with Morrigan's Cross save for some minor details. I liked the story, I especially Cian's story, the most but again, all predictable. This novel didn't dissapoint, it just didn't excite me either.If you are looking for a light vampire/supernatural read that has a bit of romance, this series would be a good choice. However I would not reccomend this novel for people that light to get really involved with their characters or that like a lot of suspsense."
2,Needed to spend more time on this one...,"I am a big fan or Nora Roberts, but I think she needed to spend a little more time on this series. The plot was muddled, the dialogue uneven, and the characters spent WAY too much time talking. Talking about strategy, talking about feelings, talking about each other, talking talking talking. Usually, a story like this has more action, but I was bored. There really was no character development either. Normally, you can get a really good picture of each character, but they all felt 1-dimensional. AND, does it seem odd that each character just said ""Oh, okay"" about time travel and the like? This could have been a really great trilogy- on par with the Three Sisters, but it felt rushed and slapped together."
5,love the trilogy,"I read the first book and had to read the other two, good love story with excitement."
5,Great ending.,"This trilogy was continued from book 1 to book 2 and then to book 3 with complete fluidity,you were never lost."
2,I asked that they combine the shipping for the 2 books but still I was charged 3.50 2X on ship. Hello Swaptree B-bye Atlanta,"I can't believe shipping the 2 books on low budget rate Postal was $7.00! I asked to combine the order for the reduced rate and nothing there could give me real customer service.Everthing was auto generated.Forget this; I'm no longer your customer. I went over to Swap tree. Shipping was just 2.50 a book, and great trades. No gouging the purse string here! YOU control the ship rate. I can ship low ball for less than $1.99 with lighter books. You guys do a real disservice on your advertising. The 1 cent a book was great! but the $7.00 ship for a double combination order was just wrong. You lost a possible long term customer."
1,"disgusting, bloodthirsty series--""0"" stars","I have been a Robert's fan for 2 decades--own just about everything she has ever written--and this trilogy is the most disgusting, bloodthirsty, violent, grotesque piece of trash I have ever read. She just can't have written these. If the rating allowed ""O"" stars that would be my rating. Unfortunately, since so many millions of us buy on faith, the trilogy will most undeservedly end up a best-seller unit. I read #1 and threw it out, something I have never ever done with a Robert's book. Got 1/3 of the way threw #2 and into the garbage along with the untouched #3."
4,fitting end,I enjoyed this book more than the other two all and all. Easily favorite couple of the 3. Good fitting ending.
2,Derivative Trilogy,"NR obviously is a big fan of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" & ""The Lord of the Rings."" This trilogy has elements of all, especially the last two. From the first, she seems to have borrowed Glenna the Good Witch of the East. However, from the last two, she cribbed unmercifully. It may not have been strictly plaigiarism, but close. Unfortunately, with all the ""borrowed"" ideas, she wrote a not very good series. It has been done better.I agree with many others who think these books were published because of the power of Nora Roberts name and past successes. Perhaps she should take some time off and have a nice vacation."
5,The Best Ending Ever!,"I just finished reading this book, and I have to admit that I didn't want it to end...ever! I loved every character so much that I didn't want to let them go! The love story between Moira and Cian was the most wonderful story of all!"
5,my favorite of the trilogy,"I just loved Cian throughout this trilogy, and as one who has never gotten into vampire stories before, I was not expecting to find him so compelling. All the characters in this trilogy were well developed, but there was really something special about this pairing. A great book and a great resolution to the conflict as well."
4,"Implausible, But Fun","As dearly as I love the compelling romance, Nora is no tactician! I kept wanting the Good Guys to fight intelligently; but to no avail, they kept wandering in and out of encounters with an aggressive dangerous enemy as naively as school children. With that complaint aside, the characters are entertaining and well drawn. The resolution of our protagonist's romantic dillema was a bit of a stretch, as well. Still, it was a fun read."
2,Kindle Book Store,"I was interested in purchasing the kindle. Until I realized not all book titles are available in Canada! For example, The Circle Trilogy by Nora Roberts. I can get the first two but not the third and final book? The first two are kind of pointless without the final book, don't you think?"
3,poorly read,"I truly enjoy all of Nora Roberts books, and I read the first 2 Circle Trilogy books. The Book 3, I did not realize was ordered as an audio book. The story is great, the reading terrible. I would not recommend anyone getting the audio unless this is really your thing. I like to read and imagine what someones voice would sound like, not listen to a man try to read a woman's part and sound like a female. Terrible reading!"
3,Super Reader,"A pretty average and very light fantasy. It seems a group of vampire hunters from our world have gone to another to help a queen fight an evil vampire queen. Including a vampire nightclub owner, and a couple of other supernatural types.For a war against an evil vampire queen, well, there really isn't much war. The evil vampire queen is pretty lame, too. Probably because she is a crazy girl that became a vampire, not really Lilith.The battle at the end is over in about two eyeblinks. Pretty much it seems all this is kept out of it to have space for the romance parts.Other than that, Roberts seems to be a decent enough writer, but I doubt she grew up reading about medieval warfare or monsters."
1,Not Her Best..,"I usually love Nora Roberts Trilogys but this one left me cold. I could not get into it at all. I loved her witches trilogy and her others but this one...sorry, Nora - I will await your next one and hope for the best."
5,Great Travel Companion...,"For those of you interested in the praticality of this as a travel companion, trust me, it works. The maps are not enough alone to find buildings in their respective cities but between knowing their general locations and addresses you can easily navigate your way to find them. I carried this book in my pocket around Europe and can say first hand that it was the best travel guide I had. A must for any Architect or student planning on traveling."
2,Expectations not met,"This nice little book lists some architecturally interesting building, but is missing nearly all my favorites. Listing geographically is a good idea, but I prefer online databases."
4,Alot of info - to the point,"Grein/Brown's book provides good study guide material, is to the point, but is not very good as a hands-on tutorial. I started with this book, but didn't feel ready. Played with the software, purchased a software self test and Clarke's book (liked the tutorial layout, but not the writing style or length).Should be read more than once. Wouldn't suggest using this book as your only resource. Play with the software and get a good self test.I used this book, Clarke's Update to Netware 5 Study Guide (see review), Self Test Software (Big Red testing software), one week of study, and installed and played with all the software (Server, CMD, DHCP/DNS, Fasttrack, NDPS, NSS, ZENWorks). Passed the exam on my first try."
2,good if you're an expert,"This book is pretty concise and straight to the point. That's alright if you're already a Novell expert. For the person studying to get certified without a heck of a lot of experience, this ain't the answer ! Reading the Novell manuals is probably a better recourse for such a person."
4,Useful book.....worked for me.,"Another strong book in the exam cram series. Remember that the only purpose of these books is to assist you in passing the tests, and this book works well in that area. I don't think you can pass the test based only on this book though. I used it in conjunction with two other books and some practice tests. Passed the test first try.As usual the information in the Exam Cram is useful and well organized. The Cram Sheet at the beginning is to the point. That is what you need to learn. If you don't know it, find the information in the book. The book is well worth the cost, and is quite useful in helping you keep your certification. The only real drawback to the Exam Cram series is that once you have passed the test the books are pretty much worthless. They really aren't good volumes to keep for reference."
2,Good Review Material,"I found the book good, but not all I was hoping for. As with some other readers I found myself verifying information from Novell rather than relying on the facts contained within this book.The examples in the book are great and dictate by ""do step A..B..C."" The examples work well when setting up a NetWare 5 server in the lab, but fall short in real life or when anything other than defaults are used especially when it comes to DNS and ZEN.When I was expecting examples I got useless drivel, when I wanted discussion I got technically perfect examples.Thank God I am not relying on only this book to pass the exam! And, you shouldn't either.Most everything in this book you can get from the Novell website and save you the money."
3,Politics of dancing... in performance,"This book makes an important contribution to the young and growing field of dance history, but the title is somewhat misleading. Skiles Howard's conclusions about the politics of dancing are primarily drawn from theatrical texts such as masques and plays, as opposed to traditional political sources such as legislation, philosophical treaties, or court records. This is literary or performance history, as opposed to political history. On the other hand, the bibliography and notes provide an excellent survey of and guide to further reading on a variety of related topics."
2,No way!,"In my opinion this book is clap-trap, & pretentious clap-trap at that! Worse, it is dreadfully dreary & dull to read. Masses of dates, places, details that are brought together from numerous dubious sources & then presented as having some (usually preposterous) bearing on their peculier ""Jesus"" theory. It's totally unconvincing & an awesomely boring read. In fact, if this review saves one person from repeating the experience, then that will be my only reward for the excrutiating time I spent reading the book."
1,"Wholly Blunder, Wholly Garbage","I was forced to give this waste of paper and print a rating of one star because there's nothing lower. Maybe if I had read the book high on acid it would have made some sort of sense, as it was I read it sober and found it at the least boring and at most highly offensive on a religious level as well as insulting on an intelectual level. Perhaps the authors should consider as their next work a study of how the nursery rhyme ""Humpty Dumpty"" is in reality proof that Einstien was really an alien offspring of E.T.s who crashed on Earth after they flew through the Bermuda Triangle, accidentally sank the Titanic before eventually crashing in Roswell, New Mexico."
2,Too many liberties with religious history...,"Theories based on weak deductions...for a religious thriller based on biblical theory of the Holy Grail, I would suggest a new novel titled THE GOAT WITHOUT HORNS.."
4,GodAlmighty-Holy Gosh,"Long,involved,convoluted,somewhat reduntant,informa- tive.immaginative read. I liked/loved it (because of the new information). Spins a tale worthyworthy of thought."
2,"""Unimportant conspiracy jargon""","An excellent read, but it's truly SAD to think that some readers assume that this books contrived history is factual and would even base their spiritual beliefs on a book of fiction. Just read some of the other reviews to see what I'm talking about.There are no footnote or attempts to show any factual material because the book is a work of fiction. We need to read things about real serious conspiracies."
1,Book fell apart.,Took book on vacation. Around half way through book. The entire thing fell apart. Persistance made me finish reading. Can not say I appreciated books written style. Besides it fell apart. Do not recommend buying in paperback.
1,Sad and Bizarre,"It is a sad and bizarre comment on our society that this rubbish should be taken seriously enough to be published at all, let alone achieve best-seller status. It is intellectually nugatory. The size of the audience for this sort of thing suggests to me that the governments of the developed world should be spending a lot more on mental health."
1,Bad book -not recommend for any one on the earth,This is one of the bad books that I wasted my money. The authors have tried hard to present his idea in different perspectives. I can't imagine which part that they quote from Bible whenever they refer to the Bible. Very bad book.
3,Interesting,"The book is interesting, but there are just too many what-if's. I just hope that nobody just blindly assumes that everything said in this book is fact. Not that everything is wrong, but there are too many ""theories"", or they'll just make up a scenario all together just to make the puzzle pieces fit. Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, but you can't take it very seriously."
5,the best kind of mystery-possibly true!,"An extraordinary piece of detective work. The authors track down mysteries that have been semi-secret for centuries. Yes, it can be a bit wordy at times, but I think even the authors don't know how all the pieces fit, andd are just presenting all their evidence, and drawing their conclusions. And a shocking story it is."
4,Fascinating Reading,"I'd read this book back when it was first published and thought it would be interesting to read again in the light of The DaVinci Code, etc... It was easily downloaded to my IPad and I am looking forward to reading it again..."
2,passionating science fiction!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It is passionating science fiction! It only has one drawback: the authors want you to believe this is serious history. Which it by no means is.
3,"Part history, part fantasy","This is a pretty interesting book, but it's full of illogical conclusions. They jump to conclusions with little or no evidence. It is definitely not history. The book is interesting, but it is pure ungrounded speculation. And, no I'm not saying this because I disagree with the content. It's the methodology. The first half of the book is true history. But, in the second half, the book becomes a pure fantasy. The authors prove nothing new except the scope of their imaginations."
1,Would have made a great novel....,"Foucault's Pendulum is a fantastic book, a great novel, and where this book falls down is that it was written as non-fiction. The story in this book is fascinating, but its claims as non-fiction open the authors to ridicule, whereas if they had told their story as the fiction that it is it might have made for a much more intriguing book with the opportunity to develop some of the 'what-ifs' of their story. A missed opportunity, as it predates Foucault's Pendulum."
3,"Holy Moley, Holy Cow","I first read this as a credulous 15-year-old, but even then I found the claims to be entirely unsupported by the evidence cited. In the years since then, I am amazed that I could have been that generous.This is a classic case of conspiracy theory and pseudo history: cite a few plausible assertions as proven fact, and then pile loads of implausible claims and speculations on top of those supposed proven facts. It makes for a gripping narrative, but rapidly departs from what we know as reality.This is not to say that this isn't an extremely entertaining book, but only if you approach it entirely as a work of fiction. It is a fantastic yarn, and lots of fun, but please don't take it seriously at all. The three stars is a combined rating: 1 star for the historical accuracy, 5 stars for the overall entertaining nature of the book."
4,Certainly Thought-Provoking,"While it was certainly thought provoking, HBHG almost requires the reader to have a knowledge of French history and geography that, unfortunately, I don't have. While it is certainly conceivable that Jesus married the Magdalen and sired children, you have to wonder if that bloodline is still around, and what good would it do to maintain this secret all of these centuries? Between wars, plagues, the French Revolution, etc., this bloodline is probably lost. Even if it's not, what's the big deal? I don't think that there's any call for a ""priest-king"" over all Christians. I have to wonder, what's the point to keeping this big secret?"
5,"""Read everything, believe nothing until you prove it to you""","I've read the reviews of this book, and mine will not be much different. I give it 5 stars not only because I loved it, but because I wouldn't want to discourage anyone's interest in this subject. Yes, I can find things in it that are impugnable or at least argued by other historians,but it's still a fascinating book. ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" solved the mystery of ""Friday the Thirteenth"",(at least for me)and through further reseaech have found that many authors concurr to that event, masons and non-masons alike. I think it's a must read for those who are intersted in the history of secret societies."
3,A very thought-provoking book!,"Having been raised Catholic and also having been an altar boy serving Mass with the priests I always knew something wasn't quite right. This book explains much about how the Church changed the facts about the life of Jesus Christ in order to sell Christianity to the world. Reading about how the Church also condoned the murders of those who had other spiritual beliefs than Catholicism had me feel so sorry for both myself and those who continue to blindly believe in the Church's teachings without question.This book is greatly detailed, and meticulously researched. I highly recommend it to those who are both open-minded and open to questioning the Bible and the Christian belief system."
3,"Holy Blood, Holy Grail","This book is for the open minded person. The authors cover, at great lenght, their theory that Jesus had a family and .... Well let's just say that this is controversial and should be read with an open mind and enjoyed for what it is; a theory. This is a great gateway to initiate the reader to explore the fascinating history that lead us to where we are and what we believe; who know's where it might lead you."
2,Dazzling like the lights of an on-coming train!,The book is well written but facts and slim chances are one in the same. The book runs a if you believe that then how about this until your so far from the truth... not really far from the TRUTH just in a paralell universe. I tried to be open minded but come on. This is a big hairy waste of time. Its so out there its... have you ever heard of Art Bell?
3,Interesting but bordering on incoherent,"This book is interesting but sometimes becomes almost incoherent. In some chapters the writing is concise and well thoughtout while other chapters labor through odd sentence construction and statements of fact which are more akin to leaps of faith. The reader is asked to take statements as fact while the subject matter skips around the map. I think everyone should read this book because it is very interesting, but take it all with a grain of salt."
5,Before there was DaVinci Code there was....,"Dan Brown owes the authors of this work a commission.Without this book there would have been no DaVinci Code.However, it doesn't really touch on what ""secret societies"" know about Jesus.Here's a hint:1. Look up LUCIFER in any collegiate Dictionary2. Read the last thing Jesus says in the bible.THAT'S THE SECRET of the Priory Sion and other secret societies.Go to a search engine and look up ""The Lucifer Conspiracy""Look in the future for ""The 13th Apostle""I've given you enough clues.This is where you start if you want to ""pierce the veil"" that has been put upon thee...PS - Sauniere is one of the key characters in the book. It's an homage by Brown to Berenger Sauniere a major real life figure. The work is FILLED with such subliminal messages."
2,More speculation than facts,"I just finished this book and I have to say that I do not think that this book contains any real factual data. They base their evidence on documents from a secret society with suspicious credibility. As an undergraduate history major, even I noticed two huge glaring errors with their statements. Even though they sometimes can't make a conclusion with the evidence they have, they do so anyway, and then base other conclusions on it. It is a good book, if you'd like to learn about the the bible in a historical manner, but there are other better resources to learn about that, if that's what you're looking for. In conclusion, I don't think that the authors conclusions are any more preposterous than the currently accepted Christian doctrine, and they are based on just as few facts."
3,"Holy Blood, Holy Grail",I actually found this book boring in the middle. The first part and third part were quite interesting but the middle part just went on and went forever with too much information to make the book enjoyable. I personally wouldn't recommend it for anyone wanting light reading.
2,Snoozefest,"Not the most interesting book I've ever picked up. I don't know what I was thinking, or why I thought it would be much more interesting, but it wasn't. I can't get through the first couple chapters...maybe it's just me."
3,Boring and too many theories,"The book didn't get interesting until page 300. The first 300 pages seems to just tell you all kind of boring facts about descents of kings and other people. Still it tells you what the authors were thinking before they figured out what the Holy Grail was. That is why at page 300 they finally seem to tell you how everything comes together and still the rest of the book is still boring. Read ""The Da Vinci Code"" rather than reading this book in my opinion. It's just facts, facts and facts about things that only matter if you were actually obesessed with knowing everything.I couldn't wait to finish the book just to finish it."
3,Interesting,"It was an interesting book but I found it difficult to read and follow. Some serious leaps of faith to draw the conclusions he comes up with. No doubt it is the basis for the novel, The Da Vinci Code. Keeping all the names and places straight made for slow reading. Thank God there was a summary at the end of the book."
2,Blood/Grail is a hard to read text book,"If you are considering buying this book you probably already know what it says. The main premise of the book is not even discussed until page 313 in the paper back edition. Presented as a 450 page research paper it has little entertainment value and is not an easy read. There is no conclusion or proof offered to any of the theories the authors present. Holy Blood, Holy Grail may provoke thought but it is not worth the effort that it takes to read. You can make your own judgment on the content, if you can force yourself to finish reading the text."
2,Not for light reading!,"This book was a real struggle to read. For about 3/4 the author takes us through a morass of genealogies and accounts of old historical figures without really an end in sight. Just when I think I understand what he is trying to present, he jumps to a different subject, making me start all over. I was impressed by the amount of footnotes indicating thorough research, but it came across more as a college thesis with little effort to present the information in a readable fashion.It was not until the author presents The Hypothesis that the reading becomes compelling, then it ends too soon. Whether the facts the author presents lend credence to the hypothesis is up to the individual reader. Perhaps this is one of the works that began the phenomenon leading to the DaVinci Code, but I see that that there are other books on the market addressing the same subject, and I plan to read more of them. I would not really recommend this one as a starting point."
1,"History as ""Miss""tory","I can't vouch for all of the things in this book, but I knew Rabbi Arthur Zuckerman very well (whose work is cited)and his work is taken completely out of context. The authors never tried contacting Rabbi Zuckerman (his name was in the New York phone book), nor did they try contacting the man who wrote the forward--one of the twentieth century's foremost Jewish historians. Had they done so, they would have found lots that doesn't fit..this is intellectual pablum for armchair historians tired of ""People"" magazine."
4,It's a lot of info to process,"Be warned. This is a book you will have to read more than once. It is non-fiction research at it's most tedious. But, the information presented is absolutely fascinating. For me, the stuff about the Priory, Templars, and Grail Kings sometimes became boring and a little hard to follow, but the theories on Jesus and the Gospels are brilliant and not unbelievable.If you have an interest in what this book presents, I highly recommend ""The Da Vinci Code"" as a warm up. DVC puts the main info into a more concise (i.e. less detailed) and narrative form that is a good introduction to the theories presented. If DVC gets you fired up, then try and tackle this one.I gave it four stars because it's utterly fascinating, but sometimes too hard to keep up. Sometimes, it just seems to jump around and is a little hard to follow."
2,An interesting journey that leads nowhere,"I started this book with the hope of learning something interesting and worthwhile. It was interesting, but led nowhere. Sort of like eating cotton candy. Tasted pretty good until you were through, then you realize that it does not contain much substance. In the final analysis, I don't think it is worth your time or money, unless you have unlimited time and money."
3,Fun Read but...,History is interesting and exciting. We never know what to believe. That is why faith destroys us. faith in the blind. Jesus was an inspiring philosopher. no more. Who cares if he was married or had kids??? He was a man!!! and dont be an idiot thinking god had anything to do with mary becoming pregnant. common sense. if you believe that..might as well think david copperfield is the son of god. dont take my review that seriously. just planting seeds...and yes..off the book a tad! hahaha
3,Holy Moses,"If you are a historian, this is the book for you.If you do research, this is for you.If you are doing leisurely reading, this is not for you.This book requires concentration."
3,Interesting but slow,"HBHG is a slow read, but an interesting one for those intrigued by this topic. While the pedigree of the authors had come into question by other reviewers, I think this book is a good starting point for anyone looking to find out more on a very exciting and controversial topic."
3,Read with an open mind,"I do not think that these authors wrote their books thinking it was absolute fact. Dan Brown wrote a great book BASED on fact. Take the book for what you will, belive or don't, noone said it was fact. Read it with an open mind. Baigent certainly got what he wanted...For us to talk about it."
4,An Amazing Book,"The book Holy Blood Holy Grail offers great insight into the past. Not only does it lay out good framework for other authors of the same subject, but it also lays out its evidence clearly. Timelines, genealogy, and historical documents are the backbone of this book. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Knights Templar, their secrets.If you like alternate view of history and/or religion, and how it may have been purposely kept from the general public, then this book is for you. I also recommend reading the shocking and amazing new book by Daniel Aber and Gabreael called ""The Book of Thomas"". In their book The Christ Consciousness, Universal Laws, The Genetic Code, The Different Levels of Hell and Heaven, Soul Charting, Reincarnation, and much more is discussed in detail."
3,The greatest story ever told?,"It's easy to understand why someone would get upset reading this book. The authors take the history of Freemasonry (actually, the mystic legends that surround Freemasonry) and tie it to the ""real"" story of Jesus Christ. When you link conspiracies to Christianity, you're going to get under someone's skin.But few books are as fascinating to read as this one. Think of it as one-third truth and two-thirds speculation. If the authors called it a fictional account --- a fantasy about the way things might be --- the result would be a strange sort of historical novel. It's wouldn't be as compelling. Instead, they present this story as nonfiction, breathlessly uncovering the greatest secret in the history of mankind. It's an approach that keeps you reading. In the end, you'll enjoy the story as a series of curious ""what if"" possibilities. If half of this is true, the world is more interesting than you thought."
3,Declines in rigor as you read on...,"The first half of the book is a dense and very carefully researched history of European genealogy and secret societies. The second half, about possible alternative versions of the story of Jesus' life and the possibility that he was a link in the chain of a royal line, is suprisingly speculative given how careful they were to find multiple sources for most of the points in the first half. Despite the sudden drop in historical evidence, the theories were interesting and made me want to go back and re-read Luke to see how much of a stretch they're making. I found the conclusion section most jarring -- in which the authors state that in this day and age, perhaps what people really want is a benevolent priest-king. For folks who say they started out as skeptics, it sounds like they've become part of the choir."
2,Rennes-Le-Chateau Lore,"For anyone interested in the Rennes-Le-Chateau enigma, this is a worthwhile read. If you're interested in the Knights Templar, I'd suggest ""The history of the Knights Templars, the Temple Church, and the Temple"" by C.G. Addison. Whatever your reason for reading this book, it should be noted that the authors fail to cite credible, historical, evidence to support any of their assertions. For those interested in the Christian response to the suggestions in this book, I suggest ""The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence For The Life of Christ"" by Gary R. Habermas. Reading both works will enable you to make a more informed decision about the Historical Jesus and the Holy Grail legend. My closing advice ... take everything you read in this book with a large grain of salt."
2,Book of Non-Fiction,The ultimate conspiracy theory in which you would have to make great leaps of faith to believe. I'd recommend The Case for Christ for a better documention of the life of Christ.
1,Horrible!!!Psuedo Cool People Will Love This Piece!!,"This book is horrible. If you are a reader with any kind of intelligence, you will not enjoy this book. I would rather read an encyclopedia from cover to cover. What do these authors base their facts on. I think Jesus was a woman. Oh my gosh, did I just say that, let's write a book about it because it might be true."
1,"Dry, Dry, Dry!!","Never did like ""history""...And this book is a good example why!Boring, boring, dry, dry...Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
1,UNFATHOMABLY RETARDED,"If you read this stupid book you'll be going right to hell dummy! How would you like to feel the searing flames of Lusifer as you descend into the unbearable abyss that will be your eternal layer!? This book is constructed from the sinew and flesh and bone of sinners! You idiots have got another thing coming if you think there is no such thing as God and Jesus because guess what... THERE IS! I mean think about it, there HAS TO BE! I learned all about it in confirmation class, and priests arent allowed to tell lies because that would be a sin. The earth was created based on integrity and morals, and these are the ideals the church not only is founded on, but what they instill in each and every one of us God fearing Christians! Dont read this book, I know I wont."
3,"good read, but have a salt shaker handy for a grain or two","Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Although Catholic, I was not offended by the book (I like to think I have an open mind and am secure in my religion). Even so, I can see how other catholics/christians could be offended by the book.I have to say, what I most got out of the book were actually two things: 1)a lesson in the events of the Dark/Middle Ages that have shaped the Church of today; and, 2)a re-orientation toward open-mindedness and healthy skepticism toward how the bible of today is not the 'bible' of early christianity. The book points out how the books of the new testament have been tampered with by early church leaders in so many ways, including re-writing/omitting passages, and leaving some important books out. Although the Bible is still a wonderfully wise book, it's ""editing"" over the years is suspect."
2,Hilariously brilliant,"""Holy Blood..."" is one of the most entertaining works of pseudo-history I have read in a long, long time. Many facets of the book are extremely interesting and there has certainly been a great deal of original research involved in the book but the whole edifice rests on incredibly shaky foundations. The authors' casual references to subjects they clearly know little about make the book thoroughly gripping but as a serious piece of scholarly research? Come on."
1,Not for true Christians,"This book is merely a collection of conspiracy theories and the reader can't help but look for black helicopters. Should be on the fiction list with ""The Da Vinci Code."""
1,"Well, actually no stars...",I first read this garbage over 30 years ago and it is very depressing to see it make a comeback. Knowing someone in the supposed Priory of Sion makes me even less convinced - this really is gobbledygook of prime order
1,Fiction,I read this book when it came out the first time years ago. I never read a book as bad as this book. The whole book is fiction a bunch of what ifs. There is no facts or evidence to support these findings. Christians do not read this garbage! This is new age at its worse. There has never been any true historical books written about the missing years of Jesus in any of the gospels missing or otherwise.
1,These folks are wacky.,"I was about two chapters into this book when I realized that I was in the presence of some real dingbats. World class dingbats. AFter recognizing that this book has absolutely no connection with reality, I was then able to read it as a farce. As such, it makes good reading."
3,"Interesting but inconclusive and very,very time consuming.","This book has two main merits; it's investigation into the origins of Christianity and the grail/bloodline mystery. Having already heard enough on the former from another book I have to say that (in regards to the grail/bloodline mystery) I didn't feel this book was worth all the effort; slogging through all the historical facts (some relevant & many irrelevant) and lengthy hypothesises. I guess I'm fustrated because after reading the book there are commentators (book reviewers & websites) which undermine all which is said here. This book is only the beginning to a VERY complex, draining, speculative mystery. It's unfortunate how so many things are left unanswered after 450 odd pages."
4,Interpretation,"It always amaze's me how the same facts can be interpreted in so many ways.I thought this book was well written,and enjoyed it.After reading it,I just had to go looking for more infomation on the subject,and the more I looked,the more I found.From the Cathers to the Templars,to my Church.Anyone intrested in history will find many roads to travel after reading this book."
5,This book got me reading again.,"This is one of best books that I've ever read. Read it ifyou can handle tons of references to the Bible, Parzival anda lot of other material. It is about the possible existenceof a direct blood decendant of Jesus of Nazareth, and howthis has been maintained and kept secret throughout the last2000 years. The writing is totally sobering. The implicationsof course are staggering.Critical reading for everyone!"
3,"Fun, but don't expect to be convinced.","It's fun, especially for people who like the air of mystery, conspiracy, and such. However, any skeptical person will soon grow wary when they read logic like:""We felt we should consider this information authentic because if someone had faked it they wouldn't have tried to make it look so authentic.""and choices like:""Either this information is true, or someone has faked it and wants us to think that they want us to think it is true, but they really only want to confuse us.""Huh?"
4,Throw your copy of The Da Vinci Code in the trash...,"This book is the main source of inspiration for the semi literate ""author"" Dan Brown's overrated pile of crap novel. Many reviews say that there are some inaccuracies, and the authors were speculating quite a bit, and I agree. However, quite a bit of legitamite research did go into the writing of this book (unlike the Da Vinci Code), so it DOES make for an entertaining read at the very least. It reads like somewhat of an esoteric theology/ history lesson, as the reader is bombarded with a whole slew of names and dates, but the authors manage to hold your interest. So, possible inaccuracies and speculation aside, this is a quality read for sure."
4,It's a great mystery read,"By the fourth page of the first chapter I was hooked. Because on this page the authors had written about the 18th century Priest Bigou's parchment that had been discovered inside a hollow column that stood within the village church of the mountain community of Rennes le Chateau. Upon this parchment in Latin was a strange message that obviously requires deciphering. The one item of the message that has intrigued me, is the number 681. So if you like a fantastic mystery that challenges the reader to find the truth, I suggest you read this book. My own subseqent search in this exciting venture led me to 'locate' the number 681 within the Great Pyramid. Once you begin to think upon what the authors offer up as many and varied possible clues as you make your way into the book you will have trouble in putting the book down."
2,Huh?,"What a fabulously cranky book! I was flabbergasted, so I read it compulsively to see what the authors were going to say next. Then when I finished, I thought, ""Whew! What was that all about?"" I still don't know if I should take it seriously. And I simply do not know how to rate this book. It gets 5 stars for being interesting and 1 star for being believable."
4,Fascinating theories that are gaining credence.,"This is a meticulously researched, cautiously presented work that presents some absolutely fascinating theories surrounding the life of Jesus, European history, and the true background and functions of the Knights Templar and the Freemasons. It can be a little hard to follow, as the authors do jump around in their subject matter, but definitely worth the effort. Their theory and research that the bloodline of Jesus can be traced to the present day are very persuasive, and there are a number of other research works around today that are in agreement with some of their theories (current read and recommend for additional research and info: ""Bloodline of the Holy Grail"" by Laurence Gardner). All in all, a very good read, but you must have an OPEN MIND to read it (or any other works on this topic, for that matter, so not recommended for those who believe the Bible is the literal word of God)."
2,Interesting but misrepresents itself.,"The book is a great read. If you are into conspiracy theories at all, this book will take you for a great ride. After all, what better conspiracy theory to pursue than the idea that Jesus' ancestors are alive and influential today and that these reasearchers know who they might be? Sadly, if you are interested in scholarship, this book is a huge letdown.The theories presented are often very interesting and persuasive in the possibilities they hold. The research behind those theories is weak, though represented as more than it is. The writers themselves admit often that they don't have the information they need to make te conclusions they jump at, but right after making a caveat will make 20-30 pahes of statements presented as fact (even though it rarely is). Their research also rests primarily on one set of documents, the validity of which they cannot verify. This is better as a work of fiction than as it is presented to us."
3,Tough Read,I had a difficult time following this book and staying interested. It came highly recommended to me and I think I had higher expectations than what it delivered.
4,"Good Book, But...","""Holy Blood, Holy Grail,"" by Michael Baigent, is a good book make no mistake about it, but I found the OVER editing in it a little annoying. I say, leave in some the the no no's you were told not to do in Engliah class and your reader will enjoy the story more ! At least I do! When the writer takes out too much of the orginal stuff he/she writes the books seem more bland and less interesting! (Just a thought!)"
4,"Holy Blood, Holy Grail",excellent book - full of starteling theories and great information. The authors did a detailed job of research and were knowledgeable when they put it together!!
4,"Holy Blood, Holy Grail","very interesting as a litterary and scientific work, fascinating as historical one"
2,Lots of history,"I couldn't really finish this book, although it was interesting as history of religion it was pretty dry!"
1,"""A masterpiece of insinuation and supposition""","From Laura Miller, ""The Da Vinci Con,"" NY Times, Feb. 22, 2004: ""'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' is a masterpiece of insinuation and supposition, employing all the techniques of pseudohistory to symphonic effect, justifying this sleight of hand as an innovative scholarly technique called 'synthesis,' previously considered too 'speculative' by those whose thinking has been unduly shaped by the 'so-called Enlightenment of the 18th century.'"""
2,Sorry Conspiracy fans!,"In an interview prior to his death, one of the coauthors (a French nobleman) who allegedly discovered the ""secret documents"" revealing the Priory of Sion admitted that he had forged them in order to become famous. The whole ""shoking revalation"" of this book is therefore based on fake information. Sorry conspiracy theory fans! In the field of historical writing, you really should be more careful when chosing your sources."
1,Total fabrication,"This book of ""non-fiction"" makes almost as many fantastical leaps of logic with little or no evidentiary support as the fictional work that draws so heavily upon it, namely Dan Brown's ""The DaVinci Code"".There is a reason that this book fell into obscurity for nearly 20 years after its initial publication. The few sources of authority upon which the authors draw are themselves highly suspect. It would be similar to using medieval romances and nursery rhymes to support the existence of dragons, nymphs and trolls.Don't waste your time reading this book, let alone supporting the authors by purchasing it."
2,"Conspiracy buffs, this book is for you (if you can keep from laughing)","The book lacks one (1) thing: the revelation of who was at the grassy knoll in Dallas when Kennedy was shot. I'm surprised the authors didn't address that.Seriously, it is literally impossible to count the ""ifs"" and ""it appears"" (etc.) in this book. From a pure probability analysis, if one assigns a 95% probability to the ""ifs"" (etc.), the probability of this book being true is so small that it is literally zero.Yet the grandest conspiracy is this: Jesus and his followers somehow conspired with Pontius Pilate to stage ""a mock"" crucifixion. Incredibly, the authors expect the reader to believe this. This is patently laughable.Read it as fiction or as a conspiratorial view of history. Read it as non-fiction? Please..."
3,"Interesting, but...","I can well understand why so many people either love or hate this book. It does not pretend to be politically correct, subtle or tactful. It presents a thesis with a number of very good points and arguments -- but a thesis whose evidence is somewhat controversial.It should be mentioned that this is not a scientific book. I have a degree in philosophy/logic and I am not aware of any logical fallacy that authors do not commit in this book, more specifically in the latter half of the book. For example, all claims presented in the chapter 'The Priest-King Who Never Ruled' can be dismissed on grounds of flawed argumentation.To give the authors the benefit of doubt, though, it should equally be mentioned that they do not claim that this is a scientific proof. They acknowledge that it is a hypotheosis, even if a 'probable' one (as they put it). I wonder what would have resulted if they had spent some more time on fine-tuning the arguments."
3,"A little drawn out, but an interesting read","After reading the DaVinci Code, I decided to follow it up with Holy Blood Holy Grail. As conspiracy theories go, this one is a doozy! However, there is enough info in here that will make you start to think...perhaps....SOMETHING is true...If you like the X-files or listening to Coast to Coast on the radio, you will enjoy this book.Read this novel and judge for yourself. Don't let someone who has never read this book tell you what you should think."
4,Factual but sometimes long-winded,"This is a perfect companion book to 'The DaVinci Code', giving more facts behind the assertins in Dan Browns book.Holy Blood, Holy Grail does, however, tend to repeat itself in numerous places, some may be warrented, but in some cases it appeared to be used to 'pad' the book out.Great for history Buffs and for both 'DaVinci Code' lovers and haters, but don't look to this book to help you decide if Dan Brown is right or not."
1,"Stupid, boring drivel","Lengthy endnotes do not make a book ""well researched."" If you read the notes to this book carefully, you will see that the sources cited deal only with background and irrelevancies. None of this book's central claims are supported by evidence that can be independently verified by other scholars. If you're interested in ""the historical Jesus,"" there are many excellent books available that are written from a rigorously empirical and agnostic perspective. Serious, professional history is much more interesting than goofball conspiracy theory."
1,Excellent work of fiction,"This is a great fictional story, really the inspiration for the Da Vinci Code. For a long time this was assumed to have some sort of facts until the man who supplied most of the evidence was found in a French Court to have made the whole thing, including the Priory of Sion, which is a secret society only in the imagination of a French political activist.Its a very good story nonetheless, some facts mixed in with the fiction, but as for claiming to be ""factual"" in a general sense, this book is deceiving in that regard. The man responsible for this deception was an individual known as Pierre Plantard. The BBC debunked the supposed ""facts"" behind this story shortly after Plantard admitted forgery of documents to create ""evidence"" of a non-existent Priory of Sion.Like I said, if you expect to find something factual in this tome, you're going to be disappointed, if you like research Monsieur Plantard further and all the truth shall be known to you!"
3,Knights Templar,"The Knights Templar were a group of warrior monks who because of social pressures made it so they were the standard bearers of Christuanity. The historic fought in the crusades. They actually worshipped Baphomet, which is a symbol of modern day witchcraft. Covers the Templars from their formation in Middle Ages Europe to its publication in the 1980s. Possibly the definitive book on the Knights Templar. That was the largest branch of Christianity was the Knights Templar."
1,Unreadable,"I don't understand how anyone could read this book. It's basically a list of names and places. My recommendation would be to read Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is ostensibly based on ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"". ""The Da Vinci Code"" is extremely entertaining and comes to the same conclusion without droning on about all of the boring linkages, which may or may not be true anyway.In the interest of full disclosure, I gave up 186 pages into this 413-page book. But, I give it one star because I believe the authors did a lot of research and deserve something for their effort. I think they would have written a better book by summarizing their findings in about 100 pages (and use a 300-page appendix to detail the research)."
2,Damaged Goods,"The book is something I've wanted to read for a long time. My husband has The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demon's, he wanted this book for his collection.The actual book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail was a present for my husband to add to his collection. Upon opening the book,we were both very disappointed because the print runs off the pages!!!! It isn't aligned correctly and there's no way to read it until you get further in the book and it seems to correct itself. So as for this particular purchase, I am very disappointed, especially when it was to be a present for my husband."
1,Ow...,"Anybody who calls this book ""historical"" or ""well-researched"" has not had a ton of experience with research in general or early Christianity in particular. Holy Blood takes politico-theological metaphors from the first and second century CE and combines them with easily-marketable conspiracy theories and calls it revolutionary. Their research was horrible (at least as it applied to the life of Jesus and Gnosticism), which should have been obvious by the way they would start out ""skeptical"" of some finding and two pages later be taking it as Gospel (ha) fact. More New Testament scholars should read this kind of pulp so we know what's going on in the popular culture and can find ways to actually educate people."
3,Fascinating but Flawed,"""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" presents substanial amounts of opinion and speculation as fact. Some claims the authors make contradict the New Testament without citing remotely reliable sources from the early Christian era."
1,Absurd!!!,"If you like fiction and fantasy then this book will suit your needs. If you like truthful history then this book is not for you.The authors of this book have been deceived like anyone else who does not do a bit more research about this subject. By making BIG, speculative leaps to conclusions is the reason for the deception. Anyone who does a little background research will soon discover that Pierre Plantard was a pathological liar with an imagination that would lead some to believe he was on an acid trip.Contrary to what one might think, the Holy Grail is not some French 'Bloodline' of Jesus Christ that was to be protected at all costs. It never was. It was a story concocted by Plantard.All in all it's nothing but bovine scatacism. But hey, if you like a good yarn then buy the book. I used mine to start a camp fire."
4,Anything that flies in the face of blind-faith...,"There's certainly as much evidence--if not more--to support the authors' hypotheses as there is to discount them... the only arguments against that statement being variations on ""that's not what the Bible says."" That is I believe one of their main and most salient points. I do wish they had spent less time equivocating, vacillating and otherwise pointing out the gaps in their theories but considering the subject matter I can understand the pre-emptive assumption of a defensive posture. The consistency of citations, source identification and contextual analysis makes the journey far more compelling, especially in light of recent works of fiction drawn from the theories. There is no question as you read this work that it is an historical analysis and not a simple attempt to sell books based on controversy. It may anger those of faith but one must consider that if their faith can be angered so-how strong is that faith?"
1,"amazing story, until you find out it is a hoax","a woefull piece of scholarship with a complete disregard for facts-the authors exploited a theme which had been gathering momentum in france since the 60's and foisted it on the english speaking world. The basis for the book, a series of mysterious pamphlets, was a careful hoax orchestrated over 20 years by a man called Pierre Plantard who claims to be not only the rightful king of france but a descendent of christ..."
4,Interesting study,"When I first read this book, I had to step back a lot to digest it. Later when I read similar findings from different researchers using separate sources (Born in Blood, by Johnson), I re-read the book. Now with Goddess of the Gospels, the picture is becoming more complete. This book is a must-read for free thinkers and seekers. The Merovingians and the Cathars may just have been correct, had they not been put to the sword."
4,deep and interesting,"I have got to readd this book again. There is so much to absorb, the levels of detail require more thought than you can spare on one read.The endless historial trivia, however, sends my eyes to crossing but as a volume for research, it's unparalleled."
4,Fascinating!,"I hear the authors of this book are suing Dan Brown from the Da Vinci code because they think he stole their research! This gives you an idea of if you are going to like this book, depending on how much you liked Da Vinci Code. If you haven't read Da Vinci then read it first--it will give you the thirst for more of the alternate history of Christianity.Basically Holy Blood, Holy Grail is all the background and research on the topic and explained in much more detail than in Da Vinci Code. These authors don't have the gift of easy narrative that Brown does--the prose is a little ponderous. Most people who read Holy Blood, Holy Grail get through about half of it and skim the rest. I read the whole thing and enjoyed it!"
3,It's okay,I've enjoyed all of Dan Brown's books and this one was recommended as one to read as well. I haven't read it yet.
3,OK,"I found certain parts very interesting, while other parts threatened to put me to sleep. I think it was the nitpicky attention to tiny details that made it difficult to stay interested. It did not sway my opinion on the subject matter one way or the other."
3,Another Masonic Fabrication?,"Definitely a speculative sensation. However, the Magdalene myth has been put to rest with excellent works like Acharya's 'Christ Conspiracy.' More precisely, the entire gospel story has been shown to be a celestial allegory, an astronomical tale. 'That Old Time Religion' (Maxwell) and 'Brotherhood of the Sun' are other relevant reads."
5,This book is both eye-opening and iconoclastic.,"Holy Blood, Holy Grail is the story of a grand mystery,starting at the time of Christ's crucifixion and continuingtoday. The authors lead us meticulously through evidenceinvolving the Knights Templars, the Huguenots, the TempleMount in Jerusalem, and a small church in Rennes-le-Chateau,France. The conclusion their evidence points to (thoughI will not disclose it here) contradicts the very tenetsmodern Christianity is based upon. Though one book ishardly likely to shake the Christian world, this is afascinating journey for anyone interested in history,mysteries, or Christian heresies. I was spellbound whilereading it, and I recommend it highly."
4,"Interesting, great spin on history.","After reading this book, I was compelled to read the Gospels again. It provided me with a different look at the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. I was amazed at how easily the authors seemed to come up with conclusion after conclusion of what seemed like hard facts. I was also amazed at how they picked and choosed what verses of scripture were probably true and what were untrue in order to support their hypothesis. This book made me believe again in the Bible and God's word because the argument against Jesus is weak, because it is based upon probability based on probability based on... and so on. If the foundation of the arguement is not solid then none of the conclusions built upon it are solid either. It really deals with ""Conspiricy Therories"" and that whole ideology. A very interesting read, and thanks to it, I have restored my faith in God. Exactly the opposite effect I thought it would have."
3,"Before the Da Vinci Code, same thing","This one gets the rating it does simply because it is an interesting read but not because it has much of value in it. It is the book that made Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code possible. The scholarship (if one can use that term) falls short and the conclusions from questionable sources and anecdotes are a stretch. It is, by no means, a serious study of the subject. I am a Christian who likes a good challenge - this was not it. Dr. Bart Ehrman is a favorite of this reviewer and I would have to recommend his work as a far more convincing set of research than this ""theory."" It is sad that there are so manywho think this is a hallmark of anti-Christian literature, it is not. It is a poor challenge indeed. Look for a real challenge from learned agnostics and get away from the speculation of the tabloids."
2,"Read SB 1 or God by Maddox, more indepth","The speculations throughout this book are very disquieting. Not in the sense that they are possible, but these speculations are truly just that, one hundred percent speculative. The research done is nothing more than general background history which absolutely has no direct connection to Jesus Christ. I do not support or reject Jesus, I only support what is fact and this book goes no further than the New Testament had done for years. The questions posed, such as ""Did Jesus really die on the cross or did he have a spouse,,,are rambled about here with added speculation. I am continually surprised at what the publishing industry prints, better read Karl Maddox, SB 1 or God, Jesus gets a scientific and historic breakdown, nothing beats it."
4,A Very Entertaining Read,"I read this book after reading the Da Vinci Code and I must confess I had a pretty good time with it. The authors take you on a fascinating, very interesting and sometimes thrilling ride through early Christian history/myth/legend, whatever you want to call it. Whether you beleive the authors or not, this book is great entertainment. It's very difficult to prove or disprove fantastical claims when you have very little evidence/facts. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I enjoy these kinds of historical myth and legend stories that border on fantasy (and in this case many would say that the book is outright fantasy). But it's still nice to contemplate what if whatever the authors claim is true. Of course in today's modern world I'm sure most of us don't care if someone claims that they descend directly from Jesus. A nice book to take along with you while travelling I would say."
5,best help,i am a beginner to the computer and this book has really helped me a lot.. thank you very much

THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY REGULATIONS REGARDING THESE ITEMS.."
2,Doesn't Deliver,"As a graduate student taking an Advertising, Imaging and Branding course, I was immediately intrigued by the title of this book. I purchased it and read it with much anticipation. Unfortunately, the book's title does not deliver within its covers. It fails in the area of research based analysis....no serious research was provided. It suffered from vague research references that the author claimed were done by the Gallup Organization but were not presented in a thorough manner. Overall, I felt as though the author, who happened to be a consultant for Gallup, was trying to get brand managers and organizations to hire and use Gallup."
4,Great understanding of a Brand,This book gives you a good insight about a brand and the marriage it has with its customers. Its very easy to read and enjoyable.
1,lemon,"One year old tv almost to the day....stops working...call service center...2 wks passes no phone call back. Now I call back...no record of phone call...and now we are told it is out of warranty..We paid close to $1800 for this a BJs wholesale club. It will cost over 850 dollars to fix it.The rep on the phone eluded to the fact that he receives a lot of phone calls about this plasma tv. He said I wont lie...there are issues surrounding this model. He suggested I argue the point with corporate office...He also advised me that any refund would take close to 3mths!!!Who the hell has time to make harassing the corporate office their part time job.Well cross this company off my list. Funai Electric Co., Ltd., of Japan, sells the following brand names of SYLVANIA, SYMPHONIC, FUNAI, and EMERSON."
4,Very HAPPY!,"I bought this EDTV in December 06 (Christmas present to myself). I paid $699.97 (which was a GREAT price at the time, and still is!). I was bumping up from a 32"" Analog TV! I knew this was not HDTV, but it was close, EDTV (a HUGE step for me!). It came to my door easy, the guy set it up and took the trash with him. I was VERY impressed! When I started using the PLASMA, I LOVED IT! It's a HUGE step up from what I had! If I had paid $1200 (the price most HDTV's cost), I would have been upset! But I KNEW it was an EDTV and I KNEW it cost ONLY $699.97!In life you get what you pay for! (I just hope it doesn't die in 12 months, like the other review says!)"
2,Disappointing to say the least!!!,"As a former dancer and my first love in dance was Nureyev, I found this to be quite a let down!!! I thought it would be more about the ballet and less about the goings on in the world. I know what went on impacted greatly on his life, but there was next to nothing about the ballet and his part in it."
4,"Brilliant author, brilliant book...but with unnecessary anti-Semitism","Mr. McCann is an absolutely brilliant author (one of my favorites), and this is a brilliant book. It manages to be lyrical, poetic, gritty and original...a bonus for me is that as a New Yorker, I appreciate his ability to capture the ""time and place"" of NYC. What puzzles me is why an author as gifted as Mr. McCann feels it is appropriate to insert little antisemetic digs in this (and other of his) works, when so much of his fiction augurs for understanding and respecting diversity and treating others with compassion."
4,Loved his dancing,Nureyev was a fantastic dancer but this book puts his life to be a stuck up diva. He was not a nice person but he was an amazing dancer.
4,An engaging historical narrative . . .,"Colum McCann has an engaging way of introducing you to history. Part fact, part fiction, his subject this time is the world famous dancer, Rudolph Nureyev, whose story is told through the eyes of many people with whom he had relations throughout his life, from his parents to his first ballet teacher, who saved him from a life of poverty. It progresses to his loves (the sexual ones are all male), his dancing partner, and even his drug dealer. It is truly an amazing read. You really cannot tell fact from fiction, but understanding that it is fact-based, you truly get to understand Rudi as an exceptionally talented and flawed person. And you also get a better understanding of war and its costs on humans forced to continue to live under an oppressive regime. The contrast between the lives of Rudi's parents and sister, for example, and Rudi's life of excess, granted by both the money he earned and the freedom he enjoyed, is stark."
2,"This was ""ALMOST"" as item ordered","Though I did get a cot of sorts, it's not what is pictured.Mine is BLUE, and defently NOT the item in the picture.I choose to keep it because it's a bigger pain to me to try to return it....so live & learn, call the people up if possible or e-mail, CONFIRM thatwhat we'll get in return is the SAME item as shown."
5,Excellant Service,The items I purchased were delivered as promised in A1 condition. The company gave a first class service and I would recommend to people.
2,customer service resolved issue,The cot problem was resolved by Mike in Customer Service. Nice to find company that recognizes customer service and stands behind its products.Blues fan.
4,big sleep,"The cot was a little tight when I first assembled it, so I left it assembled for a couple weeks and slept on it on the back porch a few times. Now that it is broken in, it is easy to set up. The 500 pound capacity is probably right, because I am light and tend to bounce of easily, it seems hard compared to the cots I have worn out in the past. The really nice thing is the size 6' 11"" long by 32 1/2"" wide. The only problem was the buckle for the storage strap which was made of plastic and broke when I cinched it up."
2,Not worth my money,"My cots (I bought 3 of them) were also blue. They were made from this plastic-ish material, and the first time they were used we realized we made a bad choice. One cot ripped when my 10 year old daughter laid down on it (no where near 500 pounds!). After that weekend, I tried to sew the cot back together, but the material just tears if you try to sew it. Another cot has lost its leg, and we had to use a plastic crate to keep it from tipping over. We have used 2 of the cots 3 times and one of them twice, and already 2 of them need to be replaced. The ends of the cots are easily lost, and the cots do NOT want to go back into their cases very easily.I will be buying new cots before our next event, and it WON'T be these."
4,"Not quite up to ""Per Amore"" but still worth the money","Zizi Possi tackles some of the BIG Napolitan tunes that Italian tenors have been belting out for years - ""Core'ngrato"", ""Malafemmena"", ""Torna a Surriento"" and the title tune. Although hers is a lovely voice, it proves a little fragile for this sort of fare and the rather anemic orchestral arrangements don't help. Still, there is a lot to recommend here. The disc begins with the beautiful love song from ""La Strada"", there is a touching duet with fellow Brazilian Chico Barque on the old favorite ""Anema e core"", and there's even a quirky little comic turn in a song that appears to be about a troublesome mother-in-law. (Sorry, I don't speak the language but I do appreciate that it is in the authentic dialect!) All said, it's really not fair for me to fault an artist who has never been concerned with catering to prevailing public tastes. This project was obviously a labor of love for Zizi. Brava for such a noble effort!"
2,interesing,"We found this book to be interesting, but not really helpful on sexual positions. It is more for the act of sex. Recomended if you want little tips on how to have sex, but not if you want detailed sexual positions."
4,the european colloquy for all time and space,"Readers of this book beware, its themes are huge! It contains lucid narrative of the competition from Cartesians to Newtonians for the best model of the universe and the nature of time and space. There are scarcely any baggy corners into which the reader will turn unwillingly. However, there is not terribly much about the science or the methods of discovery employed by these thinkers in their shared pursuit of important results. Koyre has written a classic study of intellectual history. Discussion of divinity and its aspects is abundant because this presence was one that the scientists were working diligently to situate without offending the authorities and employers of the age. The universe is a source whose study has profoundly metaphysical and ontological implications. Koyre brings these alive for the reader and shares the tumult of ideas that produced much of what we consider now to be a satisfactory vision of the universe."
3,A Good Overview,"This book is a good overview of how Christians can cope with just war. It is interesting and very helpful in understanding Christian Ethics from original text of such teachers as Aquinas, Luther, Calvin just to name a few. Some of the text are rather hard to read, but overall a well put together book to explore this important topic these days."
5,Arturo Chiang Women's Melina Sandal,A must have shoe for summer! Wide leg pants love this sandal. Very comfortable and classy.
3,"Well played, but unmoving interpretation","Atlanta always amazes me for their technical brilliance and vibrant sound. Unfortunately these two aspects have become the sole focus of this recording. As perfect as the playing was, it sounded more like robots than people with emotions. I liked Levi's tempo choices but in the end he failed to bring significant emotion into this incredibly violent and sad symphony. Atlanta's sound may in fact be too bright for this symphony, which requires more dark and deep sounds. If you are looking for good Levi Shotakovich, go with his recording of the fifth and ninth symphonies."
1,bad design leads to serious burns and poor performance,"Really, curling irons are not newfangled inventions - they've been around for centuries. So to put one on the market with such a wretched design is truly irresponsible. Both the on-off switch and the temperature setting are right where you grab the thing to use it, which means that by using it you constantly bump the temperature off setting or turn it off inadvertently. The temperature wheel is so loose - and not a click wheel - that it is impossible to set a temperature and insure that it stays there, which can lead to serious burns on the skin or hair. What a craptastic demonstration of shoddy design and manufacturing straight from China. Will be returning mine forthwith."
1,Don't buy it,"The design is very poor. I either change the heat setting or turn it off all together every time I touch it! No problem with the heating element, but not worth the effort."
4,Not bad for the money--worldwide voltage!,"I'm pretty pleased with this iron. I've had it well over a year, and it curls my indignant hair quite well. While I agree it heats up effectively, I haven't had any problems with burning. There is steam from the hair when it's really hot, but I'd definitely know if I smelled burnt hair.The best part about it, I discovered after having it for quite awhile, that it is dual voltage, so it can operate anywhere (if the plug matches) GREAT for my trip to Peru!Anyway, its solid, its effective, its cheap. I'm all for it. I have used it so much, I have begun to wear the letters off! =) Thumbs up from me!"
1,Hunk of Junk,"I find it hard to believe that Revlon didn't have any quality control or testing of this product. The stand is completely useless, which makes the whole item useless, because if its sitting directly on my counter, it WILL burn it. I bought this at a retailer (not at Amazon) and I am going to try to get my money back. I'm SO disappointed. As for how it curls, it really wasn't that great. The only reason I bought it was because my existing curling iron didn't have auto shut off, the curls this creates are not that great. Don't bother with this one, I wish I would have read the reviews before buying. Who would have thought an everyday appliance like a curling iron needed this much research? SO ANNOYED!!!!"
1,Dangerous - needs to be recalled!,"This curling iron is hazardous and should be recalled. I was curling my hair this morning when a big pop, and a shock followed by a ball of flame shot out of the end (cord end) of my curling iron hit my arm and burned me. Thank God the GFI plug it was plugged into immediately tripped the breaker and the power was cut off to it or I fear I would have been electrocuted. This was very scary. The spot where the cord enters the curling iron was literally almost blown off by this. This is a hazard and needs to be taken off the market. Please discontinue using yours and report it to Revlon. I'm thinking I may file a formal complaint with the Consumer Protection Office."
4,Revlon Perfect Heat Professional Styling Iron,"I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! I bought a ConAir product for her a while back and that didn't work nearly as well as this curling iron. She complained about how the curls never held. But now, she always curls her hair. I have to remind her not to do it everyday so her hair won't be damaged. The only con about this product is how easily the settings can change without you knowing it. The pros are that it has even heating, the swivel cord, and it heats quickly. If her curling iron breaks, I will gladly buy her a new one without any hesitation."
1,hair fire!,"Do not buy any Revlon curling iron! They need to recall all irons immediately. Mine, which I have owned for about a year now had a short and caught my hair on fire! I have thin baby fine hair and it scorched it, taking an inch x half inch of hair right off my head. I do not use any hair care products after wash and conditioning. It had been dry for over 6 hours. I had just place the iron on the piece of hair to curl and it turned it black and smoked immediately. Now i have a small chunk of hair missing on the crown of my head! Apparently after some research this has been an issue with their irons for at least 10 years now and it still isn't fixed!"
1,Do not buy this product!,"I watched, horrified, as my friend's hair burned on the high setting. She unplugged it and lowered it to a lower heat setting and as she was (finally) working to the other side her hair began burning off in clumps. When she ran her hand through the other side her hair was visibly a different color where her hair had burned. Her whole house smelt like burnt hair. It was ridiculous, she straightens her hair every day on a high heat setting, and has for the past 5 years, with no problems!This curling iron is dangerous! Don't buy it!"
5,Awesome!,I have used this brand before and loved it. I especially loved Amazon price! It saved me $6 vs buying it at the local store.
4,Better than expected.,"After reading previous reviews, I was skeptical but figured $8 wasn't a big risk. I was pleasantly surprised. It works really well, heats up extremely quickly and the silicone sleeve was an unexpected bonus.The only down-side is, as others have said, that the buttons are close to where your hand sits. However, after using it a few times I've gotten used to the design and adjusted. Now, it doesn't bother me at all."
1,Faulty ON switch,"Revlon RV051C 1"" Tourmaline Curling Iron. First time I used it, unit kept turning off by itself. Would not stay on for more than 5 seconds. Returning it."
2,My hair keeps getting caught!!,Zoom into the photo closer and you'll see a screw on the base. There are two on the curling iron. My hair keeps getting caught and somehow it gets unreleasable and I always have to yank it off! Ouch!
1,sent sparks flying!!,"Don't ever ever ever buy this product. I was curling my hair this morning when I heard a loud POP and sparks went flying out of the base of the iron where the cord is inserted. I had sparks land on my leg, shoulder, and in my carpet. After quickly making sure nothing was on fire, I unplugged it and did an inspection of the iron. The plastic covering over the cord had melted off and the copper was left exposed. Not only did I almost have a heart attack while doing my hair this morning, but I also have two very painfull burns on me. After reading similar reviews about this same iron online, I will never buy anything Revlon again."
2,did not curl my hair,"I have thick, straight asian hair and this product did not curl my hair at all. Barely had a curl."
1,Didn't last long...,I used this curling iron maybe 5 times before the spring broke - the lever was stuck open and I had to push the lever back in place each time just to finish my hair. Didn't really like where the buttons/dials were either - everytime I grabbed the iron it seems I was turning it off or moving the temperature dial. Will never buy another Revlon hair product again!
1,Save your money,This curling iron is just a waste of time and money. I just used it once and I felt so frustrated with the results... it just doesn't work at all! Save yourself the drama and your money. This product is useless!!!
1,Junk!,"I was very excited to have a nice new curling iron what will not burn my hair. Well, this one is constantly cold since the ""ON"" button does not work. It probably worked for a week or slitly more, so i didn't keep the receipt. I cannot even return it nowSave your money!"
2,Three times a charm.... probably not,"I've owned two of these curling irons and both times I've had issues with the on/off buttons. The first iron I had, the off button quit working; meaning I'd have to unplug the thing to turn it off. The iron finally just quit working. When I got my second iron (thinking this couldn't possibly happen again), within 2 weeks, and mind you, I only use the curling iron 2-3 times a week, the off button felt loose and I had to wiggle it to turn it off. Within 2 months, the on button fell into the curling iron.... never to be seen or heard from again. I'm done with this product!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy this curling iron!!! It is very poorly designed- does not stand on its ""safety stand."" The barrel is much heavier than its base and ends up tipping forward touching the surface that it's supposed to safely rest on. I was so afraid to put it down on my sink top in fear that it would leave a scorch mark, so I ended up holding it the whole time. It also seemed to scorch my hair. If I could give it a zero I would! Will be taking back tomorrow!"
1,Don't bother with this curling iron,"I bought this several months ago. The heat dial always turns freely and does not stay set on the heat setting you turn it to. I had to turn the dial and tape it place. I have thick, coarse, hair and even at the top heat setting I don't get results. This curling iron does nothing to prevent frizz either. The handle is so light that the point of the curling iron always tips down and touches the counter (which caused me to create a burn mark on the counter). If I were reading this I would wonder if the person was not careful, but I am a very careful person and always unplug the curling iron when I am finished. I liked my Conair curling iron much better."
4,Does the job.,"I'm pretty happy with this product. I'm not really one for doing a lot with my hair very often, and my hair has been very damaged for a while. This product actually gives my hair a more healthy appearance after use, and I can just grab the bulk of my hair and curl it all at once, since it heats so well. I did give it four stars, because even the individual curls don't stay in my hair very long without some assistance, but that's probably just my hair type. Either way, it's a great product and I'd recommend it for a good durable cheap curling iron."
3,Review,"This products is really good it does what it is supposed to do, the settings are good, ALTHOUGH it comes with a foreign plug, so if your buying this & you don't have Japanese plug or anything then you'll have to buy an adapter"
1,Fail,"I would agree that it is poorly designed, I keep bumping the temperature selection. Also, it wouldn't even curl my hair. The ""curls"" which were more like waves fell right out."
1,Danger Warning!,"First: I agree with everyone about the bad design of this curling iron. The little stand prongs are useless and the temperature setting dial spins so easily you must constantly monitor the setting.Second: This product is a dangerous safety hazard! I had just unwrapped my hair from it when a large orange fireball came out from the spring area above the on/off switch accompanied by a loud electric pop! After that, the curling iron kept working so you could electrocute yourself at a later date. (or set your hair on fire!) This product is less than zero because of the potential danger.I threw the Revlon unit in the trash and bought a Conair 2 in 1 straightener & curling iron, which my friend recommended.Happy New Year!"
1,I'd give it a 0 if it were possible,"I've tried two of these irons (one purchased, one manufacturer's replacement) and neither has worked. My hair has always curled with another curling iron, but these two just didn't curl my hair--not on any heat setting and not after long or short waiting periods for heating, not with large or small clumps of hair. Simply put: don't waste your money!"
4,Great Curling Iron!,Let me just say I have been using this curling iron for years. Occasionally like now I purchase another one only because after a while there is buildup from hair products on mine. This curling iron heats up in less then a minute and does the job it is made to do. It has a dial with 20 heat settings and automatic shutoff. I find it funny the last reviewer only complained when some freak of nature happened to theirs. Other then that it appeared they were happy with it too. Things happen. Its inexpensive and if you want a good curling iron this one will do the trick.
1,Buyers Beware! I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon!,"I bought the 1.5 inch Revlon RV050Revlon RV050 Perfect Heat Professional Styling Iron with Ceramic, Black, 1.5 Inch""professional"" styling iron several weeks ago. I do wish I had checked the reviews on Amazon before I purchased this instead of purchasing it when in a Target store. I used this twice. The third time I wanted to use it I found the buttons which control on and off were sunken into the handle and no longer would work. Now I see this is a common problem. What a waste of money! And what an inconvenience. Perhaps this defect is how made it past the Underwriters Laboratory. They knew it would not work and that one has to be able to turn it on for there to be danger of fire. Nonetheless, I will not buy any Revlon products again. What a rip off!"
3,Great curling iron,I purchased this item because I need a good curling iron and I like this curling iron because it heats up quick and fast.
1,Such a pain to use.,I have burned myself quite a few times because the little clamp gets stuck half way down ounce you release the tab. trying to maneuver the thing the rest of the way down without 1) burning myself 2) losing the piece of hair I was trying to curl is impossible! This is a horrible product.
5,My curling iron,"I had the same curling Iron for about five years. In the back of my mind I kept thinking , what am I going to do if it dies. Sure enough it died. It was a wonderful curling iron. I went to Walmart to see if I could replace it. They didn't have the size that I wanted so, I bought the bigger one. This was a mistake. So I got on the computer and started looking to see if I could find one. Sure enough, there it was. The only thing was the shipping cost was more than the curling iron. I bought it any way. I am satisfied completely.I will look on the computer from now on if I need something like this curling iron.Thank you so much for sending me to Amazon."
1,"Terrible, it burnt off a whole chunk of my hair","I was wondering why my thick hair seemed to have thinned out, considerably in one spot. Well I believe this curling iron burnt off about 12 inches of my hair.Totally gone. I'm throwing this iron away. Thanks for nothing Revlon. Worse thing I EVER did to my hair. Ugh.... now I have to grow it out all over again."
1,2 Strikes your out,"This is the second Revlon curling iron that I have purchased in the last year. The first one was a little different model and ended with pop and super heating-frying my hair. When I went to purchase a new one I had not really paid attention to brand name and made the mistake of a second purchase, only realizing my mistake after bringing it home. I would agree with those who dislike the temp setting, it needs to be reset each use because during use it gets moved. Otherwise it was functional enough, during its short life. I had no problem giving it a second chance, but after 2 months it lights up, but simply does not heat up. No more Revlon products for me."
1,"Low Price, but LOW Quality - Pointless to Buy","I have fine, thick, untreated hair.I was looking for a decent priced 1.5"" curling iron and I found this one. I was extremely excited because it had ""different heat settings"" and automatic shut off for such a good price. However, it was not what I expected AT ALL. First I started out with a lower setting and my hair did not curl. I slowly kept adjusting the ""heat setting"" testing frequently and there was practically no curl. This means that even at the highest setting (which seemed just as hot as the first) my hair did not hold a curl. I had to eventually go back to my straightener which had a much better curl. I regret buying the curling iron because even though i spent about $12, I could have put that money towards a better curling iron."
3,Contains wheat -- celiacs beware.,The ingredient list on the bottle discloses wheat as an ingredient (just as do many common soy sauces.) Unfortunately the product description here on the Amazon website does not disclose ingredients (as of 27-Jun-2012.)
2,Surprised by the raves. . .,"I was very disappointed in this book, especially after reading the strong reviews here (that's why I went out and bought it!) I've read other of Jordan's books and this was, by far, the least interesting of the ones I've read. The plot is treadworn and the relationship between the heroine and hero was very confusing. One moment they're vowing to revenge themselves/punish one another and the very next they're engaged in hot sex (which wasn't, in my view, very erotically described.) I felt Jordan was trying to have her cake and eat it too. The two protagonists were resisting/misunderstanding/punishing each other while simultaneously enjoying each other sexually. Yuck!! In romance it's resistance first, then the sweet reconciliation. Don't waste your money. If you want to read this get it at the library."
3,A good ending,"Rosalind Miles wraps up her Guenevere triology with ""Child of the Holy Grail"".Although not quite as engrossing as the first two books in the trilogy, ""Child of the Holy Grail"" was a good ending to a good story."
4,Great Comprehensive Introduction,"The text book covers many of the topics of interest in Operations Management. This text book was purchased as part of a MBA program. Unfortunately, the professor is spending all of his time on waiting line theory and linear programming. However, the text book covers forecasting models, product design, job design, facility layout, materials management, production simulation, and many other topics. There is no shortage of material for this topic. All material is introductory."
4,Well organized,"Good book / bad class. I'm an MBA student who had a last minute instructor change. Glad I picked up this book cheap, as the instructor was never organized enough to use it effectively."
3,typical text book,BORING!!! good napping material... who would purchase this on my recommendation? you'll purchase on your instructor's requirement!
1,Operations Management for competitive advantage,I would not order anything from Amazon because they do not follow through on their advertised shipping. Free shipping is a joke especially since Amazon stated shipment in less than a day but in reality it would be over a week and the book would not get to me before the second week of class.
5,VERY FINE,"O'Conor has all the tech skill and passion anyone could ask for. When he's on, he's up there with the best."
4,nice collection,"I bought this CD as a gift for one of my piano students. I did not actually hear the recording, but found it to be an excellent collection of piano works. My goal is to expose my students to the master works, and to build their musical sense."
5,An introduction to Daley's Chicago,"This engaging little book provides a great overview of how urban machine politics works. Royko knows Chicago and its secrets, and he explains how aldermen and ward bosses mobilize votes, manage their districts, and get rich along the way. There's plenty to be disgusted with here, including both political parties, every agency in the City administration, the newspapers, and - let's face it - the people of Chicago.The book also tells the story of the first Mayor Daley, who mastered the workings of the machine. The book culminates in the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Daley's greatest disaster.Royko was a long-time syndicated columnist based in Chicago. It's clear that he hated Daley, and I assume the feelings were mutual."
4,Chicago's Troll King!,"Yup, I too was alive and kicking during most of The Mayor's reign, and I have to agree, it's got the ring of truth to it. This book was intended as more of a verbal portrait of Daley and the city he helped shape than as a political analysis, although Daley's administration is effectively dissected. Civics classes AND journalism classes should be required to read this since not only is it an outstanding example of what is known in some circles as ""Literary Journalism"" but because it's more than just political theory,it illustrates the real life nuts and bolts workings of a big city. This is right up there with Caro's ""The Power Broker"" What's really wild is that I read this book right after I read ""The Godfather"" and both of the titular characters operated in much the same way!"
5,Boss,The book took about 2 weeks to arrive. It arrived in very good condition. It was and excellent read about the patronage system under the reign of mayor Richard J. Daley.
3,Inside look in the political machine that continues today,"I recommend this book for anyone to learn how American politics works (not just in Chicago). The fact is that the majority, if not all, politicians want only one thing - your vote - and they will do anything to get it.If you are in the way they have no problem with discarding you for the sake of more votes.I wish there were more books that looked at politicians on an individual basis. Are there?"
4,Boss,"Book came quickly. It was just a little bit more weathered than I expected, but it's an old book so I'm not complaining"
4,"Good story,but too fantastic to be real","I was forced to read this book for Honors Govt. It was actually on of the better books that my teachers have given me to read. While Royko can obviously tell a story, this one is to fictionalized to be of any serious use as a source of information"
4,Make sense of Microsoft's Internet offerings,"Microsoft has released such a confusing stream of products into the Internet arena, it's hard to keep up with it all. This book provides excellent perspective and historical context for those decisions. I also really enjoyed the compelling writing style of this book, especially on the fascinating charaterizations of the colorful players at Microsoft. A good read for anyone interested in the history of the Internet!"
2,Did Bill Gates write this,"Highly prejudice towards Microsoft. It is much less about How The Web Was Won, than it is about how awesome the author thinks Microsoft is, and it is just too difficult to get around.You do get some interesting history about early dealing among internet players, but again, it is so up Microsoft's butt, that it becomes a bad read."
2,"For ""what went on behind the scene"" junkies only ...","Despite falling asleep several times while working my way through this book, I trudged on in the hope that I'd find some replicable ""secret"" to success. Unfortunately, I didn't find it. All I found was an interesting chronology of Microsoft's efforts to ""win the browser war"". If you're a ""what went on behind the scene"" junkie, you might enjoy this book. If you're involved in the software industry, you probably should read this book even though you may not learn a whole lot. For just about everyone else, there's not too much of interest here.FYI, it took me a while to break the code, but the title of this book translates into ""Don't sue us because, even though we're a bunch of smart and driven guys, we face a lot of competition and could be driven out of business at any time"". I didn't believe that about Microsoft before I read this book, and I still don't buy it."
3,"Not surreal enough, perhaps","Personally, I was disappointed by Santa Sangre, mostly because it wasn't weird enough for me. It's still far more interesting than most films, but in comparison to El Topo or Holy Mountain, it's pretty tame. Those who would like to see a Jodorowsky film with a more linear plot may enjoy this more than his other psychedelic films. It's good, to be sure. Just not barking mad like Holy Mountain."
4,"Art/ Horror, and Comedy All in one","This is a great movie for all...It's got a crazy story and an awesome cast. A truly must see..You will be talking about this movie with friends and family for weeks. And for a DVD collector like my self, it's a must have."
2,Blu ray looks poor and bleached out like the cover image,"I love this movie, its a 5 star, but....I'm not sure whats going on with the other reviewers saying this is a great bright and vibrant blu-ray.The one I received was in a clear case not the standard blue case typically used for blu-ray.The one i got is bleached out it looks like a grey screen is over everything.Big artifacts and compression marks at the beginning made me leave the room.The scene of phenix in the white room with the tree shows big screen wide artifacts in the white wall, it looks like the film was cut in half then taped together.Also since I left the room at that point to do something else I continued listening to the dvd and the sound is pretty crummy at points, sounds like distortion is all I can say.It doesn't look as good as my region 2 PAL anchor bay dvd release which has nice bright color.Did I get a defctive disc? whats the problem here?"
2,Santa Sangre,"Retelling of PSYCHO with a Fellini-Tod Browning circus backdrop & flashes of Dario Argento luridness, which isn't surprising, as his brother produced it. Throw in bits of CARRIE & ""Santo"" Mexican wrestling & you have: a lumbering, stupid mess. Few things I hate more than movies that attempt to be mind-blowing but end up mind-numbing. Guess I'm just no Jodorowsky fan; I hated EL TOPO, too."
5,Excellent movie,Very interesting movie. Not your typical 'Hollywood movie'. I have a large collection of foreign movies and this is in the top 10%. Most of the actors were unknowns or 'extras' from the shooting scene but they were excellent. This movie was much better than his previous movies. It is a murder mystery movie so there are some 'bloody scenes' which may offend some. The documentary in the extra section was just as interesting as the movie itself.
4,Hallucinatory film...,"""Santa Sangre"" (1989) is a fim by Alejandro Jodorowsky. It is about a passionate and mad mother and her hypnotic influence on her son's life. The surrealistic imagery abounds in this film as one is taken down through a hallucinatory and macabre world set in Mexico. I found this to be the most accomplished film I have yet to see by Jodorowsky where an intense emotional element pulls the ideas together. The twist near the end also completely redefines the earlier parts of the film into a whole new light and makes this a film worthy of seeing again. Jodorowsky surprisingly doesn't appear in this film as he does in many of his other films, but his four sons do.The blu-ray looks wonderfully gritty and comes with many illuminating special features such as a making of featurette, delected scenes, a documentary on the serial killer Goyo Carenas who inspired Santa Sangre, an interview with Jodorowsky, and a couple of short films by Adan Jodorowsky and Simon Boswell."
5,awesome,"People go on and on about the artistic credibillity of Alejandro Jodorowsky but let's face it, most of his fans like him because they're wierdos who want to see the strangest possible thing on their screens. Admittedly I'm one of those wierdos. But I can honestly say that this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It contains enough crazy scenes to satisfy the die hard Jodorowsky fan, such as an elephant ejaculating blood out of it's trunk for no aparent reason, but unlike his other films like THe Holy Mountain, the wierdness takes a back seat to the story which flows at a perfectly timed beautiful rhythm. I would recommend this film to any arthouse fan. Though it may be too out there for the mainstream, it is full of enough substance to satisfy anyone who wants to see something that they've never seen before. Boom."
5,Masterpiece,"Very different from ""El Topo"" and ""The Holy Mountain"", ""Santa Sangre"" goes beyond the wakening of the inner self and rather shows a psychological horror drama. It's a betiful film, one of the best endings, music, everything is great!Great director commentary track, also includes an on stage inerview and deleted scenes."
4,alot of great info on ants,"The Life and Time of the Ant is a cartoon type book all about ants. We learn lots of neat things about the ant family. We leaned how they communicate, about the parts of an ant's body, and all about the various kids of any in the world. One section of the book is about hoe important the ant is in the Rain Forest. We are told that ants eat insect pests, plant gardens in trees, removing decaying animals from the forest floor, and thin out plants that over crowd the forest.The pictures are drawn in a cartoon like style. They were neat to look at while reading.This would make a great read aloud for elementry classroom during a science unit on ants. Lots of great information is presented in a kid friendly way."
2,"Great Idea, but ...","I agree the features are great, but two problems:1 - the sound is actually worse than you would expect from such a small speaker today; I could live with that, but 2 - the clock display is only readable from a very small viewing angle. You see only the amber backlight if the unit is above your line of sight and the same if it's below the very narrow fixed design height which is slightly below level with your eye. I tried all sorts of props and shims to make it readable, but if I moved, the display vanished again. I gave up and returned mine."
2,Terrible radio reception,"This clock radio has the WORST radio reception. It's pointless to have a radio alarm when you wake up to static. It's awful and I wish I never bought it. The light is also too bright (and that's on the low setting). The ONLY thing I like about this clock is that it has two alarms (good if you have a significant other) and it's relatively compact design. Otherwise, I don't like this alarm clock radio at all."
4,Best Alarm Clock I've owned.,"You can set four different alarms, it plays chiptunes in addition to beeping or the radio, and the orange/green lighting is pretty cool. Also, it has the rather dangerous but desirable feature of variable-snooze. You can hit snooze multiple times and it will let you sleep accordingly.Radio reception is poor but static wakes me up just as well as music, and I use the melody anyway."
2,good text some good artists but...,"Very good Rhigting but only a few serious art photographers in this book all the others don't know anything about photography or art and the ""visual"" failure to pass the message of the concept they are dealing with at all!There are a lot of much more better artists that deal with the same matters to choose from.Is sade to see how the curators and academics that deal with art photography, follow the art dealers and PR people and they are failing on their mission and leading this wonderfull art of photography to pathetic places"
1,gold huggies,These earrings are so small they hardly fit around the upper part of the lob.Great at $35.00.
3,"She's the Queen, But...","I love Linda Cobb's cheery, enthusiastic attitude towards cleaning. But this book seems like it was written in a hurry, with inconsistent advice, very few explanations of procedures, and incomplete indexing. At one point, she says that vacuuming twice a week is essential, in another place, she says once a week is fine. Rarely is there an explanation as to why something works, or why something should be done in a certain way. And yikes! How to find alll the references to perspiration stains? Not in the index. You've got to sweat it out through the whole book to find all the suggestions. I truly hope the Queen writes a second edition with all the details I know she would like to impart."
2,Great Idea -- Poor Execution,"I bought Queen of Clean thinking that it would be a great resource guide. One would think the ""Queen"" of clean, could provide this bachelor with some organization and structure throughout the year.After my New Year's resolution to maintain a neater household, I quickly paged through the book thinking it was a perfect fit. Her ideas and the information she shares are quite helpful.My problem -- did the editors ever think that an index might be necessary? On several occassion when I've needed an instant suggestion (i.e. the romoval of a wine stain or cleaning my showerhead), I have been unable to locate the solution, though I know it is in there somewhere. After fifteen minutes (the stain is already setting in) of fumbling through the spiral binder which feels like any page could tear with an easy turn, [...]. My solutions popped up instantly.My suggestion is: save yourself the $20 and get high speed internet."
3,A Little Fanatical,"This book has good household hints, and some good ways on how to get your clothes and house clean, but this woman is a little fanatical on how things should be clean. I mean, I like things clean just as much as any other person, but some of it is taking the ""cleanliness is next to godliness"" message a little too far, For example, in one chapter, she tells you how to clean your washing machine. It touches soap and water almost every day, for heaven's sake!"
2,"Not really ""like new""",The book took a while to get here. I was surprised at this. The binding is all loose :(Book will serve purposes soon.Thanks.
4,Love the book,"I LOVE this book! It is an invaluable source for all cleaning issues. I ordered multiples for giving as shower gifts. The product description said New, however when I got them, they all had a hash mark of permanent marker on the bottom of the pages. Now I cannot give them as gifts except to my sisters who wouldn't mind the black mark."
4,Love this stuff!,After Party is great stuff!!! I have wavey hair which I straighten every so often. I use it after my straightening ritual and its great for those flyaways. Keeps hair looking shiney and new. Just 1/2 a pump and just work it through the hair and you are set. I'm still on the same bottle I bought a year ago. LOVE IT!
5,Great product!,"I've been using this product for 4 years now, and I love it. I straighten and blow dry my hair a lot, and it shows! This stuff is an amazing cover-up. If you are looking for a product that actually protects from heat, this isn't it. But the way it smooths over frizzy, split ends is amazing. Plus, the price for 2 is the price of 1 at a lot of stores near me! I recommend this product to all of my friends who are flat iron addicts like me!"
4,"""The Wall"" is a Patriotic Book","""The Wall"" is a patriotic book. It was easy to read; that made me understand how the Vietnam War turned out in the end.The boy and his father try to find the grandfather's name on the Vietnam Wall memorial when they pass many other names. When the father reads the names on the wall, the boy imagines each name as a real person, standing next to him and talking to him.If you are interested in the Vietnam War and how people sacrificed their lives fore us, then ""The Wall"" would be a good book for you to read.I gave this four stars out of five because I found the book to be very moving. If you like books about wars, then you'll like ""The Wall."""
5,Excellent book for kids,I bought this specifically for my elementary school as they have little on the military - let alone Vietnam. They were very happy to receive this book.
5,I read this every year to my students,"I am a fifth grade teacher, and every year for Veteran's Day I read this book to my class - and every year I get a little teary eyed during the read aloud. Even though the book deals with the Vietnam War, it shows how much Veterans and their families sacrifice for our country. The story is so moving and just like the rest of her books, Eve Bunting is able to introduce kids to a difficult topic in an age appropriate way. I am a huge fan, and would definitely recommend this book to all elementary school teachers grade 3-5."
5,Beautiful,"Being a ""baby boomer"" from the Vietnam era, I think this book will help explain to my grandchildren about Grandpa and his war time. It is beautifully illustrated and tender. I wish I'd had this book when I went to see the Wall with an 8th-grade girl who made an etching of her Grandpa's name. It may not mean as much to anyone who hasn't been touched directly by the Vietnam war, but it touched my heart."
4,"The Best ""Church Windows"" Out There","This was my first exposure to the four-movement tone poem ""Church Windows,"" and López-Cobos's interpretation is still at the top, from the recordings I've heard. He's the only one who understands the importance and raw, naked power of the French Horn ostinato figure at the end. No other recording of this work gets it right. His lightning tempos in ""Roman Festivals"" should also not be missed. The ending is a whirlwind. I prefer the version of ""Brazilian Impressions"" on Geoffrey Simon's CD. If you can get a download of Simon's BI, and López-Cobos's CW and RF, you'll be better off.I just wish the level of technical recording on this CD was better. There is somewhat of a lacking in the treble, as if the sound is a bit muted. This, however, is a minor complaint, especially considering the wonderful interpretation of two out of three of the works on this recording."
4,What a recording!,"I am very impressed with this recording of Respighi's music. I was most impressed with the Church Windows suite--especially the last movement, which is a tour de force for the whole orchestra--even by Respighi standards. The other works are also great, especially the Roman Festivals.If I could, I'd give this recording four and a half stars because the organ soloist for the Church Windows suite is not identified. Telarc should give credit where it's due!"
2,Unimpressive Works by a Great Composer,"I am a fan of many of Respighi's works, but I was not impressed by Brazilian Impressions or Church Windows. Both of the works struck me as unusually sluggish, with a lack of focus."
5,Bought for gun grease,Seems to work like a charm on my AK. Remember use sparingly on any metal on metal moving parts and you're good to go. (also note there is a difference between oil and grease and YES you want both for your gun)
2,ok..but not have more features,"I bought this recently. It's easy to install but not useful much.My main purpose to buy this is to connect two monitors. But it have very limited ports. The one I use in my office have lot more ports than this one. It has only one VGA port,4 USB ports,1 for power and one more to connect mouse if no usb."
4,Just a compilation of reviews,"This is agood collection of reviews in the lipoprotein field. However, it is very poorly documented in lab techniques."
3,An interesting reference,"I picked this book up on a whim, and although I'm not really disappointed in it, I'm not exactly ecstatic either. I've always been fascinated with unexplained phenomena, and I appreciate that this book takes a fairly objective view of many so-called ""supernatural"" events. I really liked the first half or so, probably because I'm interested in folk tales and legends and there's a nice cross-cultural representation. The book even gives some explanations for certain events, or admits that as yet no one knows how or why some things occurred.My one complaint is that some of the entries could have been a little more in-depth. This is great as a reference book -- useful for getting a quick overview of an event or phenomena, but really only leads you into further questions to research."
3,Adequate for my needs.,"I bought this book to become familiar with Vista before it actually shipped. It presents a lot of good and useful material, but I would suggest the author make the new features a little more obvious. I spent time reading about certain features before realizing that they were also part of XP.I haven't installed Vista yet (any day now!) but feel I have enough of an understanding to become somewhat productive right away.I am a little intimidated by the new tighter security. Nothing tries my patience more than wanting to do something on MY system and finding that I have to jump through hoops to do it. The author spends a quite a bit of time on the new security model and how to configure the system to account for the tighter model."
4,Fascinating but not an easy read for the non-scientist,"I really enjoyed this book even though a lot of the chemistry was difficult for me to follow. Luckily, Mr Lane has a great prose style and is adept at explaining things so, except for a few brief sections, I was able to read the book through without skipping over too much. Obviously, oxygen is crucial to our life-form but I would never have remotely at guessed some of the more startling things I learned about this enigmatic element. A great read."
5,Excellence in science writing,"This is an outstanding book I recommend to anyone interested in undestanding how modern science is advancing its world view. The book connects seemingly disparate topics ranging from the origin of life, ageing and other day-to-day concerns with one another via the web of evolution. A relaxing yet illuminating read"
4,This was hard material for me!,"This was a long, difficult read, but it had really great stuff in it, especially the first half. The author gives a great history and explanation of evolution, and a lot of great chemistry lessons as well. It is amazing how much of our world is affected by the properties of oxygen.I did find it very difficult to understand the concepts at times, and my mind would wander while reading it. I felt that I would need to read the book a second time to really understand everything, but I don't think I can face it.The second half of the book was a little more boring for me. It mostly deals with aging, which I find to be a depressing topic, and it was a shift away from all the cool things oxygen can do that filled the first half.Overall, I'm glad I read it. I learned a lot, but I'm not going to read another chemistry book for a long time."
5,Best sciece book of the decade,This was fantastically written science book. One of the best non fictions that I've ever had the pleasure to pick up.The breadth of topics covered is amazing. Mr. Lane does a wonderful job at weaving myriad of different topics into a coherent and engaging story.
5,More than you can ask for in a book.,"The story of Oxygen in the earth environment is detailed, butgoes further in its side explanations of the many various subjectsrelated to this story. The mystery of photosenthesis was clearlyexplained at the molecular lever in such detail as were the othersubmentioned processes of this book. I found this man to be agenius of knowledge, seeming to know something about everything.I do not know how to write books, but If I did, it would be this way. You will never go wrong remembering the author and buyingwhat he writes. A 10+ in my experience."
4,I only wish I knew where the artist was...,"Maybe a year or so before this album came out, a user of a forum I frequented posted several new age tracks he had composed, as a sort of homage-to/project-inspired-by his favorite author. Some wonderful tracks, and quite varied from track to track: some soft like Two Moons, and some harder and fiercer. I downloaded them quickly, and still enjoy them on a regular basis. I even downloaded and saved his introduction and description of his work, explaining his specific inspirations for each track. I'm glad I did, because shortly thereafter, all of it was pulled: the user said he wanted to try his hand at selling his art.Almost all of the tracks were, to my knowledge, never to be seen again, except for ""Antiquity"". (I promise: the sample here does no justice to the song.)I just wish I knew if he was ever planning on releasing the other tracks, or if he did any other work similar to that first set. I'd love to drop money on tracks like those."
5,same as store purchase at a better price!,"I previously purchase ink direct from HP & from Staples. This is the same product, at a better price. I would recommend Amazon to all."
4,ink cartridge,"product was everything it was suppossed to be, (low price). but with shipping and handling was no savings, compared to just going to wal mart?"
3,HP Black Inkjet Cartridge #21,THIS IS THE PRODUCT THAT I MUST USE IN MY PRINTER. IFOUND THE CONVENIENCE AND PRICE PROVIDED BY AMAZON.COM TO BE OUTSTANDING FOR MY PURPOSES.
2,HP 21 Black injet cartridge,I wasn't really that impressed with this item. The cartridge ran out of ink within a couple of weeks and I don't do that much printing.
4,OCProducts sells HP 21b not HP 21,"The reviews here are not specific about who they purchased from and I believe some of these sellers are selling different products.OCProducts sells HP 21b not HP 21. I don't know if the product is different inside. That is, I don't know if the ink is the same quality as HP 21, nor if the amount of ink is the same.I am told that the HP 21b may not be the same.I purchased two. When the different product arrived, I complained to the seller and they apologized for any misunderstanding, especially if I had experienced fewer prints than expected (it says about 190 on the package.)They also sent an additional complementary cartridge.Thus, as far as post purchase customer service, I think OCProducts is very considerate and responsive.I do feel that sellers should always engage in full disclosure."
4,Quick,"Shipping was quick. Cartridge was as described in original packing and worked properly when installed. Also cheaper then buying it in the store, Thanks!"
3,Ok,"This ink cartridge prints well, but I have to replace it frequently. I would suggest making an ink cartridge that lasts longer."
3,HP Turned cartdrige to 5ml only,"In the past we had cartdriges with 25ml, now they give us a printer but recover the expenses with inks."
2,Too expensive,"Not enough bang for the buck. Each year I pay as much for the printer ink as I did for the printer. The cartridges are small; so it's not surprising that they do not last long. The quality of the printing is okay, but I think the price should be at least half of what it is."
1,Not enough Ink!!,"The HP 21 ink cartridge runs out within a couple weeks. I don't print THAT many pages, but I DO use my printer! My old printer, using HP 45, ran months. This one, using 21, runs out of ink Wayyyy tooooo sooooon. It's OK for someone who prints something once in awhile, but not on a daily basis."
2,"Kinda gray, not really black","This ink cartridge was advertised as HP 21 Black, but when it arrived it was HP 21B. I tried it anyway since other reviews indicated that 21B was the same as 21. The print is actually in between black and gray. A little disappointing. Make sure you get 21, not 21B."
5,great,"Good price for my ink, Will buy from this vendor again. thank you very much for your time in processing my order so quickly."
4,HP 21,I purchased this ink cartridge as a package of 2... it was a better per unit price. It arrived quickly and was packaged well.
5,Quality,I have always received new ink cartridges and they have shipped in a timely manner. I will continue to order through this company.
5,Very Pleased,"I was very satisfied with my purchase of the ink cartridge, and would definitely buy from here again!"
5,Very satisfactory,I was extremely satisfied with its arrival time and quality of the product. Thank you.
1,ink refills,"Unfortunately, this re-fill was in the recommendation by Amazon when I bought my printer. Unfortunately, it was INCORRECT so I (and my daughter) are stuck with opened, unusable re-fills:( Im sure it would be very good if it fit my printer."
3,Not very black,"I ordered hp21, but I received hp21b. I didn't think it would make a difference, but it's definitely not as black as I expected. I don't know why the order was changed."
5,Ink cartridge,High Quality Ink! This cartridge will last longer than any other brand you may buy. I purchase this brand every time.
2,"ordered two, only one worked","one worked fine. second one the printer registered it as being full, but nothing would print...., thanks for nothing HP!"
2,BEWARE,When this ink arrived I was skeptical because it came from Singapore (labeled as 21b). It worked fine at first but ran out of ink very quickly.
1,Buy a refill kit instead,"After years of buying these I finally bought a refill kit in Tesco for less than 8 euro which contains 90mls of ink (yes 90) plus everything else you need. Filled my HP 21 cartridge with 5mls of ink, took just 5 mins and it works perfectly. 17 more fills left @ 45 cent each. Might not get 19 runs from the same cartridge but I have old cartridges I kept (they were too expensive to throw away even when empty). And the kit comes with cleaning fluid for old cartridges with dried ink in the nozzle. It kills me to think of all that money I've spent on new cartridges over the years - never again, total and utter rip off."
1,Not worth it,This ink came in as 21b.....not 21. The prints are a bit fuzzy and not very dark. There is a big difference in the quality in the 21 ink you get at Walmart and this 21b ink. I would not recommend and would not buy again.
2,Found ones cheaper for much less $$,Did not get a lot of copies at all I have found cartridges at half the price getting double the copies. Plus they are quality copies.Go figure. I will stick to good cartridges from cartridge world or on amazon. They are better products for less $$.
4,Compatable Ink,"Re Compatable ink cartridgesSo far this seems to be a compatable product but the real truth is how it does in the long run and by then, good or bad, I'm continuing the race of life and not looking back too far. If this isn't satisfactory, I'll go with Factory ink in the future."
2,Pricey and little ink,"Less ink, more consumer and manufacture waste . Increase volume of cartridge. Corporatism? lolCan self refill these for about 20-30ml then the head is shot and you must throw out."
3,No insights here.,"I read this book hoping to find insights about corporate culture and how to change it. The authors make a case for changing corporate culture, and tell why it doesn't work. I figured that much out on my own -- that's why I wanted to read the book.They went on to present a ""model"" which doesn't help much either. What would have made this book work is a discussion of company norms. People tend to live up to what's expected of them, and norms are expectations of people's behaviors.IMO, the book is too general. The authors need to try changing cultures themselves, then talk about the specific problems they had."
1,Waste of Money,"Don't waste your money on this one! Although this could be a great book for colors and counting, it is poorly designed. The ten ballons do not fit well in the holes provided and are difficult even for me to get in their proper place. This has been a source of great frustration for my 17 month old. The ballons are attached to the book with ribbon which is long enough to tangle easily, but is not long enough for little hands to manuever the balloons into place. I would be embarrased to re-sell this book, it goes directly to the round file, the ballons may better fit there."
4,I could've used a gross of these!,"I'm still waiting for the right man to use this on (any man would do at this point!). But yes, I have purchased the kit and will make a replica of my future man's you-know-what. It would be fun to use the replica to pleasure the man's rear with his own you-know-what!Ladies, I know you will agree, I wish I had been able to use this kit on all the men I've ""known"" over the years."
1,Avoid these.,"Bought these as part of putting together a tool kit for my wife's recent interest in house-flipping, so that the house tools didnt keep disappearing. I always thought of Stanley Tools as American made and good quality. Not in this case on either count. Sent them back to avoid mangled screw heads, will wait for the next Craftsman sale at Sears."
4,"Clever, Lively Spoof","Love the concept of the ditzy dame being in a show because her husband has backed it. Mercury trying to teach his emotionally challenged father Jupiter about how to feel love is both funny and poignant. The music and lyrics are upbeat and full of zingers, but also tender in spots. Come see a production of this fun musical in May of 2013 at Westfield Community Players!"
4,Good Advice,"Being a fan of advice columns (I especially loved Dear Abby, even though I haven't read her column in many years) and Q&A; books (even though I haven't come across very many), I thought this book would be perfect, especially since it is Christian advice.I really enjoyed reading the book; the Q&A;'s were interesting. I agreed with most of the advice. I so badly wanted to give the book 5 stars. There were a few answers that I did not agree with, especially the one about the abusive husband. I know I would never advise anyone to stay with an abuser. And I did not agree with the one about the disease. But other than that, the book was very enjoyable, and I would definitely recommend it."
4,Low Voltage Only,This set works great for low voltage wiring such CAT3 or CAT5. I found it difficult for Romex or when running multiple CAT3 or CAT5 to the same box simultaneously. Some outlets I would run six wires including RG59 which required a larger size bit. If you are running only one or two wires then this kit would be fine. I would also recommend a getting a 12' greenlee glowstix or fishstix.
4,Classic Look,It's exactly what I thought it would be. A classic look that will make your vehicle look sharp. The quality could be better but it serves its purpose.
1,Worst of the series,"I own all of the Top Secret books from Tood Wilbur, and this one is the absolute worst of the series. Contains repeats from previous books, and some from his website. A few new, but I was not impressed. If you are new to the Top Secret series, I would recommend the Restaurant Recipes, and the Soda/Smoothies one. They are the best of the series."
1,Unappetizing greasy recipes,"Ugh. The recipes in this collection contain enough grease to keep Mr. Lube Car Care in business for eternity. Very few call for real ingredients, either: I would expect a recipe for cinnamon buns to call for flour, yeast, and sugar, not that fat-choked, weird-tasting, ridiculously overpriced packaged croissant dough garbage.Not worth borrowing from the library. More real cooking next time, Mr. Wilbur, and less pre-processed glop."
2,Who wants to buy my book?,I really don't like this book. I bought this before I discover 'American Test Kitchen's cookbooks'. Save the money and buy anything by Cooks Illustrated instead. At least your meal will come out right and not so greasy... imagine 2 C. of butter for the base of your pasta!!!
4,love this book!,"I love the first edition of this book, but I have to say that I love this edition more now that I have tried at least 15 of the recipes here. They truly are ""Secret Recipes"" from the well-known restaurants around! This is a must-have for every so-called cook! My family loves that we get to eat ""restaurant food"" without having to go out of the house!"
3,Not Quite the RIght Fit,"I like these type of pants, but I had to return the pair I ordered because they didn't fit right. They were too tight, which I don't understand since I regularly wear a size smaller than the ones I ordered. I assume that it had to do with the sub-category of ""fit"" - classic, relaxed or loose, but I haven't found any options to choose which ""fit"" I want and I saw nothing about it in the description.Overall, I like the pants. I like the metal clasp instead of a button. The cell/mutli-use pocket is great, but finding the right ""fit"" online is too much of a chore and unfortunately they still charge you to return them."
2,waist band flops over belt,"After only three months wear and washing only in cold water, the waist bands on these trousers constantly flop over my belt. I will have to replace them. Fabric is good at resisting stains, very strong. But waist band needs better reinforcement."
3,Buy the loose fit pants if you do squats!,"I have large thighs and a big butt. Unless you like to call attention your butt, buy these pants a size larger or buy looser fitting pants."
3,Thin working pants,"Bought 3 pair of these pants and with in the first week two ripped. I've snagged my clothes on items before and they do not rip. But with these a large hole forms. Now since I've had them for several months the rear end is wearing out at the wallet area. I like the side leg pocket, but these pants aren't true working men clothing. Will need to be tougher in my opinion."
4,Dickies multi pocket pants,"I love this pants purchased 3 for work they fit perfect all around, and have the cell pocket that used to be on the double knee pants, I prefer this ones that are regular fit."
5,Perfect for work,"I purchased two pairs of these several months ago, and am very happy with them. I work 5 days a week, and switch pairs every day. Yes, I know I do a lot of laundry. But the point is, these pants hold up both through the wear and wash. I have found that the little pocket on the right leg is perfect for my cell phone. It keeps it right in reach, and prevents the other things crowding my pockets from scratching it."
4,Great-fitting pants,"I have been a Dickies fan for a long time and Dickies are the only brand that I buy when it comes down to my work attire. These Dickies pants looks great, fits great, and feels great! Choose Dickies...you can't go wrong!!"
3,Doesn't fit like it does in the pic,"The pants were everything I was looking for; however, I prefer a lower ride than what these pants offer (see pic). They look and feel great, as I tried one of six on and they would work for me, sans the fit."
4,Comfortable to wear,It is hard to become dirty and it has also an adiabatic effect. Cloth is strong.The worn touch is comfortable.
3,Dickies Pants,"The pants are a good fit length & width, but the crotch area is too long. I have shorter zippers on some of my jackets. The belt loops are small and will not fit a wider belt."
2,Firm waist. Baggy leggings.,"I wear size 32W pants. I bought size 33W Dickies pants, and expected them to be a bit loose. While the legs were pretty baggy (even more so than I'd like) the waist wouldn't budge, wouldn't stretch. I suppose this is expected with Dickies pants, but like I said, I have plenty of nice 32W and 33W dress pants. They all fit fine. These did not fit at all. If I were to increase the size, the waist may fit but the legs would be ridiculously loose. If I buy Dickies in the future, it'll only be if they have some sort of ""slim-fit"" option."
4,Honest value and high utility along with good looks,"When you want comfort, good looks, and good wear Dickies will bring it. One suggestion - wash them before wearing for the first time - much softer after one wash. No wrinkles when you get them out of the dryer quick. As to size - Dickies is not generous in providing extra room in the waist - order your true size (no elastic stretch here). I wear them to work in a business casual environment - now most people would not do that but I look like some one who would so I can get away with it, if you are looking to rebel a little then you can too. Dickies are a great replacement for jeans when actually doing physical work our outdoor activities as they will dry faster than jeans if you get caught in the rain. I also use as a replacement for jeans when on my scoot. Four stars for wear, quality, fit and value."
3,Not up to par,"Pants were priced cheaper than local store where I usally buy them but quality was not the same, pants keep stains that won't wash out."
4,Strong and Sturdy,"If you have a job that requires you to business casual but involves working in a dirty or harsh environments, I highly recommend these pants. Although they do indeed ""feel like cardboard"" when you first get them, they break in a bit after several wash and wear cycles. Even though they never become quite ""soft"" or what some might even consider ""comfortable"" they are quite wearable for what they do.This pant is a workhorse. You can beat the crap out of them and they won't fall apart on you. Do take care to note that they will shrink a bit if you wash them in hot water or dry them on a hot setting.Yay:- EXTREMELY Tough Pant- Excellent Color-Fastness- Solid Price- Dickies Logo Easily RemovableNay:- ""Feels Like Cardboard"" When New- Harsh Texture- Pants May Shrink Slightly"
2,Bad Fit,The pants fit like some dress slacks...way too tight in all areas. Also the belt loops are very small I can only fit 1 of my belts thru the loops which is not a problem with any other pair of pants/jeans that I own. Overall I would not buy these pants again. The fabric is durable which is why I gave the pants 2 stars.
2,"Would be good pants, if not for a few things..","These, and ALL Dickies brand work pants would be perfect if it weren't for the following:1.) They are stiff as cardboard. Incredibly uncomfortable until you wash them several dozen times or wear them in. If you wear them for the first time and it's hot outside, they are stuffy, itchy and you sweat like a pig in them.2.) A button really needs to be what holds the pants closed, not a clip. When you kneel down to do something, it pops open, which allows the zipper to come undone. Not cool.3.) Waist rides too high and is so tight that if you tuck in a Dickies shirt (which some places require) you won't be able to close the pants. The shirts are a whole different story...... they suck too."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"I was sent a pair of pants covered in animal hair. I am disgusted!!!! How dare they, who would think that is ok?"
2,Bad,It may be that I'm just not a Khaki kind of guy but these suck. They just fit weird. I'm tall and slim so maybe thats why... I hate these pants. Wore them once and I'm trying to figure out who I should give them to.
2,Too close fitting.,I order these for my husband in the size that he always get from Walmart and Sears but for some reason these wear just too fitting for him so I would say they are cut small.
1,disappointed,"they send me another size, i ask for 34X32 and the send me 32X32 i'm now out of the country so i can't return it i feel very bad, won't buy there ever again"
4,Nice fit.,. Product well put together. Very comfortable and easy to clean. Looks good at causal events but tough enough for work.
4,Good product,These are good slacks for the money. I will be ordering again when I need a good pair to work in.
5,very comfortable,i bought this for my brother and it fit very perfectly...it looked very nice and smooth on him...he loved it<3
1,Pointless,"This is completely UNAUTHORIZED by the band, meaning there are no interviews with the band, and no music by the band on the DVD. Features the same 5 band photos over and over, no live clips, and interviews are okay, none with the band. If you really want a biography on MCR, get ""Life on the Murder Scene"". A little more expensive, but has 2 DVD's and a live CD, tons of music by MCR, and interviews with MCR. This DVD has audio a couple of recordings of the video interviews on ""Life on the Murder Scene"". Trivia was okay. I would not have bought if I would have known how bad it was."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"The ""film makers"" of this piece of garbage misrepresented themselves as a film crew for the BBC. Everyone interviewed in it were lied to and edited in a way that would make situations appear different than they were. Eyeball Records did not knowingly agree to be involved in this dvd. This is typical British tabloid junk. Save your money."
1,What A Bummer,I love MCR as well and I am just dying for something new from them and purchased this item. I thought it would have other interviews that did not make it on Life On the Murder Scene but all it had were interviews by people from Eyeball and radio disc jockeys. Yes the same pictures of the band were shown over and over while these people discussed there over exaggerated experiences with the band.
2,video,"Bought this video for my daughter. She said it was okay, but she would have liked to see more of the band in the video. This was why I got it for her."
1,"oh, please","Yeah, Sure! This DVD should be called,""My Chemical Romance: Things That Make You Go YYuck!"""
3,Too small for the size,"We had to order this costume twice since the actual size was smaller than advertised. When we called the store to get a bigger size, we ended up paying for expedited shipping which was not right. Also the hat was not a good quality. It did not look like the picture , it was smaller, made out of a cheesy fabric. You have to struggle to make it look decent by steaming and ironing it. Overall for this price you could have found a much better quality but We didn't have time for it. Sh. Gardner, PA"
4,IBM ThinkPad T23,"The T23 seems to have the best combination of build quality (keyboard, display, case), upgradeability (UltraBay for CDROM, DVD, CDRW, Combo, 2nd HD, Floppy, etc), and support (online driver updates) of any laptop manufacturer. Performance is good (but not the best), and price is higher than average for the feature set. Reliability of my T20 and T23 have been excellent (flawless)."
4,Entertaining,"It's Mr. James Coburn as remembered !A look @ the mechanics of the slot machine and how to play.Although the video is older,the technical aspects applies.There are scenes of slots in play,which makes this instructional entertaining.I play the video on the weekend.@ this time of posting,it's Saturday 11.07.09.I will see it today !"
4,The best hair gel.,"Aussie Sydney Smooth Styling Tizz No Frizz Gel Tube , 7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)This hair gel is the best I use it just about every day right after I finish washing my hair. It's not one of those that makes you hair super hard but still soft and workable. An if you don't like it you just put you hands through your hair and it comes right out. Really great for holding curls. Just put in a go!"
2,Too shiny,"It works great but I do not like it because the ""shiny"" part of it makes my hair look greasy at the roots."
4,"Good product, but stick just a bit",I used to use KMS sculpting lotion hairstay but they discontinued it. This was to be a replacement and it seems to have a good shine but still sticks a bit.
4,Moody music,"Very mellow piano solos, perfect for inspiring your dinner date to cling to you hoping that you will defend her from the heartless world."
5,A wonderful children's book...,"My daughter fell in love with this book when she was about 18 months old and at 3 loves it just as much. It is about a father and his child and how he would love his child of he were a mouse, a kitten, a puppy, piglet, etc. and what he would do to show his love. The illustrations are very cute and the book is patterned well enough that your child will be able to interact with your storytelling quickly. I have ordered 3 paperback copies of this book to keep at home and the grandparents so she never has to be without. A special book to teach your child about love."
5,A lovely daddy-child book,"This is a sweet, heartfelt book about loving and taking care of whom you love. The black-and-white illustrations by Tommy DePaolo suit John Graham's gentle text just perfectly. We first read it to my son at about the age of 1 or 2, and it's still one of his favorite ""comfort"" reads now that he is 8."
5,Nicely done,"I had a pleasant surprise with this book. Not just a theory discussion, this book is a nice overview of the ""how to"" of a practitioner who uses gestalt. I highly recommend it to those embarking on integrating gestalt in their work."
1,Over Rated and Corny!,"Being a fan of haunted houses and horror films this sound effects album had me curious. I also noticed it had a lot of good reviews so I gave it a shot. Well I don't know what the people who gave this a good review were thinking but I found it corny and juvenile. Some of the voice acting is overkill and embarassing. I got this for about $4.00 and felt ripped off. If you want a good haunted sound effects album, check out Disney's ""Thrilling Chilling Sounds of the Haunted House"" reissue from 1979."
1,Terrible,"Looking for a great scary music cd for my haunted house, downloaded this which was a mistake. Wish I could get my money back, terrible effects."
5,Excellent recording of opera choruses,"I bought this album for the ""Coronation Scene"" from Boris Godunov and it did not disappoint. All selections are excellent especially the Bizet and Verdi. I have yet to find a Robert Shaw performance that wasn't top quality. This one should be in every opera lovers library."
4,Fascinating Perspective,"Unique in the genre, this book takes the reader through actual news clippings surround the Jack The Ripper case. The authors are clearly well-versed and don't seem to have a bias toward the identity of the ripper. It reads as easily as watching a documentary and for anyone really interested in the curiosity of Jack the Ripper, the book is well worth the heafty cover price. If not for volume for the book is thin but for the integrity and presention of the material. Hats off to the authors!"
4,"Very good indeed, but still...","This is a lighweight, well made and well printed book and it is well worth having. A serious criticism for me is that the early murders before a scalpel was used such as Tabram are not included. Also the letter published in the Telegraph in November 1888 complaining about the hideous bellowing of the newsboys is not included, and I wonder what else of interest has been ommitted... This gives a good overall account of the scalpel murders. The press coverage of the time is still the best source of information for me and there should be more collections like this, eg The Star, The Daily News."
5,This one could be the only appetizer book you will ever need,"I bought this book because I borrowed it from a friend, and I WORE IT OUT. Now I need to replace hers! I used many of the appetizers for my daughter's wedding reception. The presentation of the food is beautiful, and the ingredients are economical and easy to find. I catered the reception myself and my father said that he has been in some of the finest hotels in the world and they had nothing on the buffet I did myself. The recepies are simple to do. Each comes with full instructions and photo directions. I priced several caterers for close to the same type of buffet I did for my daughter. The cost would have been anywhere from $1000.00 to 1350.00. I did the whole thing for under $200.00 THANKS June Budgeon -- you made me a star!"
1,The Book of Appetizers,"I was very disappointed in this item - it was going to be a gift, but it was used, torn and yellowed."
2,Personal suffering not history,"This tape series covers the personal suffering of people in the war. What it does not cover is the history of the war, why it happened,or why it unfolded as it did."
5,Best World War One Documentary,"This is by far the best WWI documentary. I have seen a bunch of others, but this one adds the intangibles that the others don't: perspectives, art, depression, grappling with issues and the war itself. Also, PBS offers an incredible website that goes along with the documentaries. They need to come out with a DVD series of this ASAP."

4,Who designs these covers!!!???,"Good movie- I agree with most of the reviews. I just want to knowwho designs these AWFUL covers like the semi-nude with the shoes.The British version,and they are not shy, has a funny picture of Ruth Gemmell and Colin Firth on the cover and it's easy to see that it is a romantic comedy involving sports. Do they think that an American will not buy it and it needs to be 'spiced'up? They did the same thing to the movie 'Persuasion' several years ago."
3,Soccer or Colin?,"I bought this movie to see Colin Firth. The plot was hard to follow and was mainly about soccer. Frankly, I don't see how the love story developed at all.But still, I bought this movie to see Colin and I did. So all in all, I give it an average rating. It could be entertaining if you can relate to his fascination with his soccer team."
3,Fever Pitch,Imagine an obsessd football boyfriend who thinks of little more than that. Here is the plot for Fever Pitch. Paul (Colin Firth) is sloppy and uninterested in pratically everything and everyone except Aresnel his favorite team. Not my favorite Colin Firth movie but he makes the most of this somewhat enjoyable story. There are some truly funny moments that arise from his obession and you see he is not a bad guy but just to preoccupied with football. If you like Colin clean cut and sweet like in BJ or P&P it will take a few minutes to get use to his look here. If it is raining and you have pizza pop this movie in
4,Cute but rumpled,"Took a few viewings to warm up to this movie. Very similar to High fidelity. I suspect it would be a lot more meaningful if I was Bristish. Not used to seeing Colin Firth looking so rumpled, but got used to it after a while. Didn't really feel any chemistry between these two people. Some logistics bothered me...ie: when she hails a cab with no purse.....hmmm, how does she pay?? Minor point, but bothersome just the same."
2,inexplicable diminishment of book,"A lousy film which could have employed the nuanced, diaristic programme of the book's delineation of a football fan's inveterate, but acutely recalled failings. Instead it took dead aim at a lowered version of conventional romance; with a not very credible object of affection."
2,fantasy,"A cleverly directed film can inspire audiences to share the characters' affection for each other, but just as often, films fetishize obnoxious, childish, or selfish behavior, and watching two people mysteriously bond over actions that should drive them apart is generally more baffling than affirming...Such is the case with Sarah and the unbearable Paul.No self respecting woman (or man for that matter) would find such behaviour in any way endearing. The status of their relationship at the end of the film makes me think Fever Pitch belongs in the fantasy/science fiction category."
2,Read the book,"See, Colin Firth is this middle-class bloke who's really into footie, so much that He Just Can't Commit to his girlfriend. And that's it. Basicly a movie about relationships, which might be interesting except both main characters are cardboard cutouts. Not a lot of romance or humour or even football. Unless you're a diehard Arsenal supporter, I'd skip the film and go right to the book."
2,No TITLE,"I did not enjoy this movie on the grounds that the characters were unsympathetic and boring. At the end of this film I walked away not caring about the movie or the people in it. The cover of the box said ""Romantic Comedy"" but the film was neither romantic or funny. Colin Firth plays an emotional ... soccer geek who hooks up with a desperate ... retentive co-worker. No passion. Nothing."
4,Gets the job done,Excellent buy and is very sturdy. I use it for my monster gaming machine and I have dragged all over the house.
1,I threw it away after 160 pages,"The plot is ""one thing after another"" -- Conan the Barbarian plotting (I read one of those once, must have been desparate). Inventive, well-written.But, the character is pathological, and there is a lot of re-thinking and re-living the murder by knife which is described so well. Not someone you would like to know, not particularly interesting in his pathology.Possibly there is some brilliant plot yet to come. Possibly there is some deep connection to quantuum physics. But, they sure aren't revealed by page 160.I pass along almost all of the books I buy. This one, I threw away.I read tons of SciFi, prefer 'hard', where there are serious constraints because of scientific laws. There isn't much discussion of such, and is nearer fantasy than 'hard' SciFi. At least for the first 160 pages."
4,Hitler's War is very well-made,"Hitler's War is a very informative documentary. I had seen some of these clips before, but not as good in picture quality as you will see here. You see footage of Hitler giving speeches with English subtitles, which is always interesting to see. Although I disagree with his actions, his bravery and dedication to improving Germany held good intentions (unfortunately, he chose a path of slaughter to reach his goals). Great archival footage of soldiers fighting, planes dropping bombs, Hitler leading his followers, buildings burning, and hostages being shipped away (never to be seen again)."
2,Mediocre at best.,"Needing only a few bucks more to complete a free shipping order, I tacked this on. Normally I read some reviews of a product before I decide to get it, but I skipped it this time. It came back to bite me in the butt. After watching the first of 2 parts I started to get the impression that this was a little different than the war I had had an interest about for 40 some years. Lo and behold the credits revealed it written by a revisionist named David Irving. Had I read a few of the reviews by some of the other very observant participants who purchased this item, I would have skipped it.There may be some good footage as well as a general overview of the course of the war, but it interjects some subtle ""poor Germany"" and ""vicious Allies"". into the narrative. I won't go into much more other than to say save your money and put it towards something like BBC's ""The World At War"" or Millcreek Entertainment's ""War In Europe"". Don't let this one come back and bite you in the butt."
1,Severe allergic reaction to this product!,"After drinking 1 oz of this juice for four days, I developed a severe case of hives all over my body with intense itching. Now three weeks after I stopped drinking it I am just starting to get my skin settled down a bit - with prescription antihistamine pills and many topical anti-itch creams and lotions. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to something I ingested in my life until now, but I do have occasional hayfever and animal fur reactions. I checked the web and many others are reporting this same skin reaction to acai berry - so beware!"
3,"Good Review, but No Guarantee of a 4 or 5!","""Cracking the AP Physics"" is a perfect book for a quick review before the AP or test during the year; its summaries are for the most part easy to understand, inclusive of major people and events, and concise enough to make for a quick read.However, this book is NOT an appropriate alternative to sitting down with whatever physics text book you use during the school year and really studying. I would strongly advise against relying on ""Crack the AP Physics"" for your primary study resource.I found that the AP exam that the book includes is good for seeing how well you know your stuff before really sitting down and studying, but again, is woefully inadequate to prepare one for the actual exam. I would strongly recommend getting other AP exams, questions and problems from your teacher to compliment this book.A decent buy as a review book, but by no means guarantees a 5, 4 or even 3 alone."
4,A Big Help for an AP Class,"This AP Physics book has been one of my best sources for studying for the AP Physics test. The AP Physics teacher at my school has never taught this class before, and her lectures are often not very helpful. The review sections in this book are very helpful--they include sample problems and questions that show you how to do the work. This is great for me because the tests in my class are based on the AP test, and using this book almost garantees a 4 or 5 on the AP test this May. If you're having problems with Physics, or just need a little extra help, this book is the way to go. The only problem I had with it is that it's hard to read this book and keep up with the one we use in class. Other than that, it's great."
3,Not really great for the AP exam...but it still has its uses,"This book is good for reinforcing topics already learned in class, but horrible for self - study (which people with not-so-concise teachers will need to do).I've found myself better off getting a cheap college textbook with answers (or even the infamous Schaums series) and learning out of a written work like that.I'm still going to keep my Princeton Review book, however, because while it doesn't seem to work well for the AP Physics class (which I suspect deals with different teachers/teaching styles in an unstructured environment for teaching AP material) I think that I will find a good use for this book as a quick reference work as I move on to college - level material and beyond."
2,Don't expect to learn physics,"The makers of this series are particularly good at exploiting your fears about the AP test. No matter what they say, reading this book will not automatically guarantee a 5 on the AP exam. Whatever you would have received before getting this book will be the score you get after reading it. But, it's utility lies in the fact that, after taking the practice tests, you will know what sort of a score to expect. I consider myself to be one of those rare people in high school who actually understands and appreciates physics, and looking back at this book, I thought the attempt at teaching physics was horrible. Buy this book only for the practice tests."
2,Not what I was expecting,Jewell Parker Rhodes's new writers guide is a real let down. It doesn't offer any concrete advice. The whole book is excerpts of other non-fiction books and bits of pep talk. I took my copy back and was refunded my money. You'd be better off reading an old copy of Frances Spatz Leighton's guide to non fiction writing.
1,Don't waste your money or time,"This crummy wiper includes 6 parts and pieces, enough to fit 8 connection configurations. the aggravation to figure this out is crazy and in the end, I really only want 1 wiper with 1 connection to fit 1 car (mine). Despite Amazon's ""car car confirmation"", it didn't fit my Saab.Anco, Champion (the manufacturer) this product is a miserable failure. For entertainment, also read the first review with rated with a 5-star rating and this review: ""It was suppose to fit the 2004 Nissan Quest but it did not. It did come well packed in a huge box."""
2,"Overall, pretty brutal","This book could have been written by Microsoft's PR group, since it so blatantly paints them as innocent coders just trying to better the world and makes no attempt to balance that position by exploring any dissenting opinions. The first few chapters are relatively interesting, covering some of the early internal development that's not widely covered elsewhere, but as soon as he gets near the antitrust stuff, Andrews is so pro-Microsoft that it's tough to believe what he's saying."
3,"Don't Make a ""Fussy"" Over This ""Hussy""!","I grew up in the 50's...but somehow I don't even recall hearing about this picture. The title alone made me laugh! Bought it thinking I couldn't possibly watch all of it...but the graphic cover sold me! Turns out to be a fairly entertaining movie...for a B movie...or should I say C? Must have been great fun seeing it at a drive-in theater with your favorite girlfriend! The price is right...so if you're ready for a ""steamy sex movie from the 50's""...this is the one for you!"
4,Well worth Current Pricing,"Overall this is a thumbs up purchase for me. The build quality is superb and they sound clean, without distortion even at high volume levels. The speakers do lack a little on the low end but that was expected with a small speaker. I expected a littl emore low end response than I am getting but all in all I am very pleased."
3,New York City Turned upside down,"In New York Minute there were identical twins Roxy & Jane Ryan. Roxy is my favorite she is a rebel. Then there is Jane she is a goodie-two-shoes. I like Roxy better because she's not afraid to go to the extreme to get her way. Jane is scared to do anything that is not a content of her planner. Well, to see what trouble they get into you'll have to read the story (or go see the major motion picture)! Will they find a common ground? Read New York Minute to find if this adventure can bring these two very different sisters together!"
3,New York Minute,"This action-comedy starring the Olsen Twins was a little to obvious for my likings. The string-of-events like being locked in a car, chased down a subway, in the middle of an illegal operation- was a little to unbelivable. However if your a member of it target audience you might like it."
2,Not a good recording,"The Cleveland quartet is one of my favorite string quartets, but I do not like this particular recording of theirs. It just didn't have the right kind of energy. I've listened to many recordings of the brahms quartets, and I think that Alban Berg and Emerson play these well.As for the Cleveland Quartet, buy them playing Beethoven or Debussy and Ravel. Those recordings are phenomenal."
5,Very Satisfied Customer,"I installed this memory in my Dell Dimension 3000. The memory went from 256MB to 2GB! My computer now boots up and shuts down MUCH faster and doesn't freeze up when multiple tabs are open. The entire process was easier than I thought---I looked up my users manual on the Dell website and printed out the pages showing you how to replace the memory. The manual stated that placing identical memory cards in BOTH slots would be optimal. Amazon offered a pretty good deal on this 2 GB kit. I turned my computer on its side, removed the cover, took out the old card, and installed the new memory as directed. Opening up my computer also made me aware of the amount of dust collected in it (especially the fan vents and inside the front panel). Wow! After a through cleaning, it's running quieter. This low cost upgrade will make it possible for me to keep my current computer much longer."
2,Good RAM but only 1 module worked,"Good RAM, but I have to give a lower star rating as warning that not all modules will work. Only 1 of the 2 modules worked. I tried various things to make sure it was the module and not the machines I tried it on (3 DELLs). Definitely the module. Anyway, I have mixed feelings about the product because I will have to exchange one of the modules and I know that can take weeks."
5,"good memory, good price, worked fine","I put this memory in my Mom's Compaq Presario SR1830NX to get her PC up to the max 3GB that Windows XP 32 will recognize. It worked great, she is very happy with the upgrade."
3,CORSAIR RAM Review,It is just ok. There is really no difference between the RAM I replaced (Patriot) and the Corsair Memory. Actually the Patriot is a little stronger than the Corsair. The price for the Corsair is more affordable though.
5,Great Stuff,"My computer used to crash a lot (programs hanging, BSODs, etc.), but after changing RAM with these ones - my PC started working like a swiss clock. Great stuff!"
2,Delivered memory slower than specified,"The specifications for this memory kit specifically states ""2 X 1GB PC3200 400Mhz 184-pin Timing: 3-3-3-8"".Instead, the memory that I received is has a performance configuration of 3-4-4-8.I've tried this memory on two motherboards, both configured to automatically set memory speed according to the on-chip SPD (part of the DIMM that stores the module's specifications to allow hardware auto-configuration). In both cases the same memory specifications were reported.I knew that by buying CAS3 memory instead of CAS2 or CAS2.5 that I'd be sacrificing some performance, but this ""bait and switch"" has left me with slow memory that I would not have ordered if the proper specifications had been listed.If all you need is a lot of RAM, then this is a reasonable solution to your needs.But if you expect performance, don't even think of buying this product."
4,OK,"Works just fine. Nothing spectacular. A little expensive, though. It is getting more and more difficult to find this particular kind of RAM, so I can't complain too much."
3,2gb value select memory,"My computer immediately recognized the new memory,but did not increase the speed much.Which is strange since I was replacing 500mb with 2gb."
1,waste of time & money,"bought these memory cards for my older computer thinking it would speed it up a bit. spent half a day researching what the correct replacement memory cards would be and half a day reading reviews as to pick a reliable product. received memory card in a timely manner & installed them. started up computer and within minutes computer locks up. took these memory cards out reinstalled original cards and computer runs ok. so I tried the new memory cards again with the same result, a frozen computer. put the original cards back in and computer runs ok, slow but ok.so here I sit with my slow running computer with a lesson learned for $100.00, don't bother trying to improve an older computer, just save up a few more dollars an buy a new one."
1,Corsair Memory,One of the two memory sticks failed intermittently. Purchased Corsair memory based on previous reviews. Paid more than competitor's product to ensure usefulness. Spent more time and effort to determine which of the two sticks were failing. End result was twice the price for one useful stick of memory. Next time will just buy the cheapest memory rather than expecting brand names to test memory.
4,Ram,The Corsair dual memory was easy to install and made the computer run faster. It also made it easier to run multiple programs.
1,DOA,"One SIMM DOA. I had to send it back RMA to Corsair, on my dime, and then it's like 3 weeks to get new."
1,Timings Not As Advertised,"Listed Timings: 3-3-3-8Actual Timings: 3-4-4-8As another reviewer stated (but apparently ignored and not addressed), the shipped product has 3-4-4-8 timings, slower than the listed 3-3-3-8 timings - this is crucial when adding this RAM into an existing system with 3-3-3-8 timings, as the motherboard chipset will use fallback/alternate (slower) RAM speeds for overall system synchronization and stability.Furthermore, this is one of 2 different memory products I recently purchased from Amazon whos actual timings dont match the advertised/listed timings (and in both cases, are of course, slower).I highly suggest that Amazon review their product verification/QA procedures for RAM (and or replace/retrain the personnel responsible for this department), if for no other reason then to avoid claims of deceptive advertising/practices, etc (not to mention reduce returns/negative customer experience ratings/overhead)"
4,All's Fair - Anne N. Reisser,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERWith his startling green eyes and jet black hair, he looked like a panther. And he was rumored to be a man who loved the hunt but walked away free while his prey lay bleeding...Morgain McMichaels didn't reed to be told. One look and she knew. When he found out she was his mechanic, he was shocked. When he learned she was his pilot, he was outraged. But he would gladly have her as his victim. Well, he was in for another surprise. If Gareth Hammond's markings were plain, Morgain's were not. She was a honey-haired, blue-eyed hellcat with the face of an angel. And she silently swore to be ""the one that got away."""
3,The Sudoku,It is an ok product for the price. Has lots of level and puzzles for each level. Does not have anyway to know what ones have been completed and what one have not.
3,Sudoku plus,I like it but wish it had a light. I only got it today so I'm still trying to figure some things out. The date and time feature is extremely nice as well as the alarm.
4,More on th DVD,More included on the DVD than orginally thought. My son really enjoyed the first season and can't wait till season 2 comes out.
4,Kids love this show!,"My two girls love this show (and I have to admit, I think its pretty fun too)! The price is fantastic too!"
4,Good Kids' Series,"I think that this television series is a good kids' series for children to watch. Unlike shows like iCarly and SpongeBob, the writers haven't put subliminal messages into the script and whatnot. This is actually like the good shows of the old days like Lizzie McGuire, Phil of the Future, and That's So Raven: It is a good, clean, wholesome series that the whole family can enjoy and parents don't have to worry about their kids learning terrible or disgusting stuff from."
5,my babysitters,i love this show it is amazing because my little cousin will neal got me into it. thank you will!
1,Horrible :(,"It is so awkward and weird, the pad is hard and DOES NOT stay on the frame at all.The cover in the photo? DOES NOT come with it and no one from the company can tell me how to get one.I wasted the last of my savings to get this bed for my daughter becuase we are limited on space and we both lost our jobs within the last 12 months. It was a huge disappointment. I feel as if I wasted my money."
4,Perfect for small space,"I purchased this for my sons room to go under his loft bed and still have room for his desk. He enjoys reading and laptop time on the couch portion and his stepbrother has an easy place to sleep on his weekends. Its more comfortable to sleep on then the air mattress and is sturdy. The boys tried jumping from the loft bed down onto it and the inside wiring structure did bend and then the 120 lb dog jumped up on it and it did break loose from the outside frame. Even though we were too rough on it, we are still enjoying it. The outside structure is sturdy."
2,Could be better,"Futon was good for about a few days, the metal bars underneath started bending and snapping because multiple people used it. Best used for moderate use, like a spare cot. Constant usage will cause this futon to no longer be of use.Otherwise it's not bad. It's pretty comfortable and better than dorm beds. But constant use? Wouldn't advise it."
1,lasted 30 days,After a month one of the legs just snapped off. The cheap weld on it just broke and it snapped off.
1,Disappointing,"Having bought this book and hoping to receive a well written and illustrated overview of all current military helicopters, I was disappointed to find a lot of errors in this book.Some examples: page 47, AH-1J sea cobra shows the picture of a AH-1S (now F), page 69 Denel Oryx shows a Puma picture, page 70 shows a AH-1S (F) and is titled AH-1W super Cobra. Also in the text there are some errors (in the specs of the UH-1N it is stated this a/c has a T53-L13B engine). A lot of types are described multiple times but under different manufacturer names / countries. Some types currently in service are omitted and types out of service are described.All in all fairly disappointing for an author who is a former member of the British Intelligence services. My advice: don't buy this book and if these books are printed have them final-read by somebody who knows his/her helicopter types"
5,Love this book.,"We had this book around the house growing up and it looked awesome then. This book is filled with traditional skills that are all but disappearing. I look forward to working on projects from the book with my sons. If you want to get an appreciation for the spirit, strength, and courage of early settlers, buy this book."
4,Good Primer,"This is a wonderful primer for those that are interested in learning more about the rural lifestyle. Of course one has to understand that this is just the bare boned beginning, however, it is very good in giving you that info. Furthermore, this book covers some of the techniques not covered in other books in this subject category: their handling of tinsmithing is one interesting element that I have not seen in other books. Some of it is somewhat outdated, but as I said: it gives the bare boned basics."
4,Good information,Looking forward to trying many of the things covered. It is informative and written clearly and interestingly. We found the book covers so many different things and a good learning tool for our kids.
5,Great post-oil book,"This is a classic on pre-oil skills of the 19th century. It is becoming an important work again. But the latest edition of it is published by Skyhorse Publishing as ""Back To Basics""."
5,"This book has everything you need to do all basic things, and more!","This book has how to to everything. From planting to cooking, from tanning hides to making shoes. You name it and it is in here."
4,I love this book.,"This book sits on my parents bookshelf, they wouldent give it to me so I got my own. It shipped very fast, but it might be worth the money to get it in new quality. I plan on using it and geting it dirty and didnt need it to be new, it came water damaged. Im not sure who is to blame, the package was sitting next to my mail box in the snow. I dont want to downgrade the book, it tell you eberything and is VERY usefull. If you plan on taking it outside and using it as a guide, then a little dammage is no big deal. I can still read everything I need to read, so I'm ok with it."
4,Definitely back to basics,"This book definitely takes you back to the basics. Some of it seems 'cheesy' but that's because it's so ""basic."" It serves it's purpose for me."
4,StrongArm struts for Toyota 4Runner,"Great product- I highly recommend. The lift supports do not include new bushings, so I made some from nylon spacers and washers obtained from my local hardware store."
4,bumper buddy,"We use our bumper buddy to carry our hand truck and tent frame on the front hitch of our truck, thus saving space for other display items and stock in the back of the truck. Great addition, easy to use, sturdy and larger than some bumper buddies."
1,Wrong Part,I ordered this item thinking it would be as displayed in the picture. It is not even close.This part will not work as a substitute for my application.
3,"Nice book, but the selection of works is limited","This book is a catalogue for an exhibition that was held at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The reproductions do not represent the full work of Millet but rather the selection of works that was presented in that exhibition. There are many reproductions of drawings, pastels and watercolors, and only a few paintings. Many of the drawings are preparations for larger scale paintings. I bought the book after a visit to the Musee d'Orsay in Paris and was disappointed not to find many paintings that I remember from that visit - not even ""The Angelus"", which is probably Millet's most famous work. Still there is a large number of beautiful drawings and paintings, and the introductory text is interesting. I wish the reproductions would be larger - there are only about ten full page reproductions throughout the book."
4,"Crucial information, dry, but worth it","This book will not win any awards on being a page turner, but will certainly be an excellent resource to a manager who deals with outsourcing. As my business would not exist without outsourcing, I wish I could make more customers read it. Was very good from the perspective of what our company should be doing to help with the client. This book contains some information that took me years to learn...Dry, but a great reference for business owners and managers alike. I have no idea how to improve the book to make it easier to read, but found it sometimes difficult, otherwise I would give this book 5 stars!"
2,A lot of loose ends!,"The film starts off good. Researchers are knocked off one by one by an assassin. Who is this man? Who does he work for? The film then takes bad turn by not explaining more in detail what's going on. The premise is there. There are moments of suspense. But, the execution just doesn't work. Blame the story and screenplay for that! By the end of this film, I wondered ""why""? We don't get that answer and this film leaves a lot of loose ends. Marginal thumbs down."
1,"Booklet, Not Book","It's sixteen pages, a fifteen minute read at most and you can find out most of this info by surfing the net. Still more annoying, the author doesn't bother with footnotes and if you want to track a lead, such as a statement attributed to Libianus on page 5, you're on your own as Libianus isn't even listed in the bibliography either."
5,Brings Back Fond Memories,"As the title of this review says I have played these games as I grew up in New York City... I purchased this item and have started to show my grand children what I did as a youngsters... The book and the items that come with it provided me with the real tools to teach my grand children... This item was found by me on the Amazon site though I was not actually looking for it, again the price was reasonable and was shipped to and received by me in a timely manner..."
4,Explains what the movie left out.,This is close to the current movie and explains the back story the movie didn't have time to cover. Dennis O'Neil shows he understands the Batman from comic book legend and writes a story that is satifing to both the comic book fan and those who only enjoy the movies.
4,Great buy!!,If you're a Batman fan this is the book for you. Excellent storyline giving us an insight into how Bruce Wayne became Batman. Characters come to life and the author reels us in with the mystery surrounding Batman.Only one flaw - would have liked more romance with Rachel.I gave it 4 stars.
3,i thought,"being a fan. knowing that the joker/jack killed his parents. i thought that's who should have killed them. other than that, the books grate."
4,"If the movie is half as good as the book, it will be great.","Dennis O'Neil adaptation of the screenplay of Batman Begins is a great read from the first page to the last. The story packs a real punch and tells how Batman began his career. A few surprises are thrown into the mix and you get a top notch read all the way.If the movie is half as good as the book was, it will be great.Four Stars"
4,"Very good read, could have been a bit better","I loved the movie, so naturally I enjoyed reading the book. It did have some extras in that it gave a little more information as to the origination of Ras Al Ghul. It also showed a bit more of Bruce Wayne's earlier life, before Batman. Once he became Batman, the extras pretty much stopped. I was hoping to perhaps read some extra scenes not shown in the movie. I was also a bit disappointed in the action scenes. I did enjoy the book, but I thought it could've been a little better."
4,Batman Begins,This is a great and nice prodcut. If you need to know a little more about Bruce Wayne you should read this book.
2,Crappy Crossroads,"If you're looking for photos of old Times Square, stay away from this book! Instead of photos it features drawings, and not very good ones at that. You'll pick up a few historical points on the area that became Times Square and how it changed up until the late '50s."
5,"""The Government Models"" - Book on the Colt 1911 Pistol","I am very satisfied with the book I received through Amazon.com. The book is what I ordered. It was properly described and what I wanted. Using the standard delivery option, the book arrived quickly. The book was packed well and arrived undamaged.Dave Lambert"
4,"Slender in Size and Scope, But Worth a Read","Shirley Hazzard's memoir of Graham Greene on Capri came rather later than the main flood of memoirs and biographies that followed the death of the master. The author shares her memories of evenings and meals spent with Greene and her husband (the writer Francis Steegmuller, whose ""Flaubert in Egypt"" is one of the jewels of my book collection) on that exotic island, home to so many notable expatriates of yesteryear, Lenin and Norman Douglas among them. The book is interesting for its depiction of Greene in all his annoying lovability, although when you finish it (in little more than an hour) you might feel the need for more substantial fare. ""Greene on Capri"" probably won't be of interest to most people, but for diehard devotees of that difficult genius it makes for a worthwhile read."
5,Don't understand how anyone wouldn't LOVE this book,"Shirley Hazzard brilliantly evokes Capri in this easy-to-read portrait of one of the 20th Century's most influential British authors. This book melds literary biography at its best with personal memoir, and Hazzard's friendship with Greene offers important insights into not only his work habits and travels, but also his interpersonal relationships. As to her prose style, Hazzard may be a part of the ""old-school"" authors--long, serpentine sentences and frequent digressions--but there is only enjoyment to be found in the quiet island life she chronicles. Anyone interested in Greene, Hazzard and the beautiful isle of Capri itself will delight in this book."
2,Not Greene nor Capri...,"Shirley and Francis must have lived a more interesting life than the one depicted in this book. The book is about a literary couple who interacts with Graham Greene once a year on Capri for a short time over a number of years. Or at least Francis was literary -- Greene certainly did not see Ms. Hazzard as a peer. Close friends they were not.The book is barely about Capri and much less about Greene. However, the book is about Ms. Hazzard's pretentiousness.What little valuable information is found in the book, is hidden among difficult prose and incomplete thoughts. Ms. Hazzard goes from one topic about herself and F. to another. Every so often Greene is introduced as an after thought.Her book is sad, not because Greene was always difficult in personal situations, but due to her own frustrations."
3,Plays well enough,"Plays well enough for a beginner guitar. Decent deal, though I should have gotten it when it was under $100."
4,Great pictures,Great coffee table book. I really enjoyed all the photos. Some space in the book could be better utilized. There are some pages almost completely blank except for a very small picture. Overall great book.
5,thoughtful and beautifully written,"The first thing to know about this fine book is that it does NOT preach. The object is not to make the reader feel guilty, but to think and search within herself or himself. The word ""meditation"" on the cover is key: this is a glimpse into Julie Salamon's own soul-searching, amplified by her talents as a researcher and writer. Reading this slender book is like taking a seminar from a very wise teacher, and taking the lesson in deeply. Julie talks to everyone from rich philanthropists to a homeless man she encountered often, and helps us think through some of the deepest goals of philanthropy. This is a quiet book that will make you really think about something that deserves thought: how does giving change the world, and us, in the best possible way? I know it will change the ways in which I give, and the reasons I give as well."
5,A thoughful meditation on giving,"Ramban's Ladder is a delightful book that weaves togther the challenges of our modern life with direction from ancient Jewish texts related to philanthropy and our responsibility to community. A lovely and personal view of how giving changes the life of the ""giver"" as much as the life of the recipient of the charity. Highly recommended."
4,Electronic version is full of errors,"This is for the electronic version only. This is a great early Wolfe story. This is probably my third read in about fifteen years (and the first time I have read the electronic version) and I still enjoy it every time. Please note that the electronic version has many errors and they can get really annoying. Virtually every ""he'll"" has been replaced with ""hell"". There are many other annoying errors also. Random House Digital Inc. has done another sloppy job of converting a book to digital. I suggest buying a paperback instead -- it's much cheaper and will have very few typos."
3,Unlikely Wolfe,"The third Wolfe, in similar melodramatic vein to The Red Box. Adventure story riddled with improbable coincidences. Check out Some Buried Caesar to see how much better the characters were just a couple of years later."
3,Take the Pledge of the Rubber Band,"Rubber Coleman got his nickname by always seeming to bounce back after being knocked down in a fight. [Why did this remind me of Bill Clinton??]Rex Stout bounced back from The League of Frightened Gentlemen with this one - the first of a few of his which jumped off Manhattan Island and recounted a tall tale of the old West. The League scared some of his early readers, I think: it was too ethereal and high-concept.The Rubber Band shoots from the hip, by sharp contrast. Since Rex had traveled the whole United States by this time, and had spent considerable time in the West, his background should at least lend credence to the accuracy of this story.However, like some of the reviews below assert, its actual credibility is really thin. I won't say more, since the book is enjoyable despite its flaws, but don't expect Fer de Lance, and......you won't be disappointed."
5,Madness as Prior to Reason,"Daniel Berthold-Bond explains why, in Hegel's Philosophy of Mind (part 3 of the Encyclopedia), madness is logically prior to reason. The answer lies in the extreme negavity of consciousness. Mad destruction is required before the subject can build a symbolic existence. The work is heavily Lacanian without any evidence in the footnotes that this was consciously intended. The book does much to make the under-recognized connections between the thought of Hegel and Lacan. The book is extremely well written and is one of the finest contributions to Hegelian interpretation in recent times."
5,Great Product,This is a wonderful video editing and DVD creation product. It it the first video editing product on the PC that I have used that doesn't crash on every project. I have done 6 large DVD projects without a single crash! The tutorials make it easy to learn at your own pace.
4,Be sure you're getting Version 6.0 if you have DVD Handycam,"This is my first experience with video editing, and I found this software very easy to use, combining video with recorded audio, voiceover, background music, etc. to make something nicer than just ordinary ""home movies"". I recommend it.HOWEVER, if you use a Sony DVD Handycam, BE SURE you get Version 6.0 of this software, not 4.0. Amazon doesn't warn you of this, but 4.0 won't capture directly from DVD's. You'll need another program (Sony Picture Package works well for this).Sony's Customer Service is superb. They explained what the problem was to me and offered me a free upgrade to 6.0. I'm very happy with Sony.4 stars, not 5, only because of the interface issue, now comfortably resolved."
1,Big Let Down,"Though it says it will, it will NOT open any of my AVI files with the video - only the audio shows up.Pinnacle, ULead, and Windows Movie Maker, all had no problems opening them - But Sony Vegas Movie Studio did!And you better allow a couple of hours just to download the 66MB patch for this product, Sony's web site throttles you to about 8KB/sec! - Thats over 1-3/4 hours! Absurd! (especially when you have broadband)Havn't even used this thing but I regret buying it already.Sony's on my ""never buy again"" list."
1,To Complicated,"This software is to complicated for the average DV camcorder owner. After reading the full manual all I could produce on DVD was sound no video. I spend weeks reading and following the manual insturctions (poorly written) waisted 20 DVD discs. You need to be an experienced professional who understands how to edit time lines and video tracks and markers. I gave up I deleted it from my computer and the software sits in the box. This is not the software to buy if you only want to put your vacation videos form a DV camcorder onto a DVD. Try using Ulead Movie Factory 5 for slower computers or Movie Factory 6 for faster computers, it is easy to use and understand."
3,It needs more power,"This will probably be the only complete version of Khachaturian's catchy ballet that we'll ever get. The only problem is that the orchestra doesn't bring out the full emotion that was brought into the score. Also, the conductor sometimes loses control over the symphonic players and the sound quality is nowhere near excellent. All in all, it's a so-so recording of the (only) complete Spartacus."
4,Professor's Point of View,"After having taught the Destinos series for the past several years, I can honestly say that it is one of the best, if not the best, programs available to learn Spanish. However, it does require absolute time commitment on the part of the student. The materials are well integrated and provide an excellent tool for learning language and culture. I definitely recommend it."
3,He loved The Wiz?,"I enjoyed this book despite myself. The author just LOVED some really wretched movies - The Wiz shaped his life? However, his tales of growing up gay in a Catholic family in Reading, PA are interesting and evocative. A fun little diversion for those of us who grew up more into theatre, movies, and glamor than sports and girls."
2,colkenzie,"I recently purchased this book on line and was very happy with the service from Amazon and unhappy with the book. I find it very boring and difficult to understand as a Westerner ""who wanna be"" an Easterner. Surely there must be a more Western friendly interpretation of the Tao Te Ching."
4,Looks great! No valve?!?!?!,"I would have loved it if they told me that this would not fit my existing valve. Yes, it says that there is no valve included. But did you know that every shower valve cartridge is unique to the manufacturer? I didn't and so I didn't order the valve. I thought that they would be somewhat universal. Boy was I wrong. Learn from my mistake: The valve cartridge and body will probably not go together even within the same manufacturer. If your unit is a couple of years old, buy the valve that goes with the new unit and replace it when you can. It cost me over $400 more in this DIY project because I did not know this! The downside to this is that a lot of complete sets at Home Depot are half the cost, look just as good, and INCLUDE the VALVE."
5,Excellent!,"I found this book by John Bramblett to be the greatest source of help since losing our 11 month old son in July to a very rare and rapid infection. I cannot count the books I've read just since July but this is by far the most honest, encouraging book I have read so far. I finally felt like I was normal. The author tackles the issue head-on and he has helped me tremendously in learning about the grief process. My husband and I are using it as a resource for a teaching on grief in our Sunday School class. I would recommend it for anyone to read. If you have not lost a child, just read it to help others who have lost people that meant the world to them."
1,why you really touch yourself,whoopey no wonder nobody offered t boz a record deal she can't carry a cd by herself neitherr can chili which was why tlc died when left eye did.
2,Not Up to Shaw's Usual Standard,"Maybe just personal taste. I don't find the arrangements and vocalizing as interesting and satisfying as ""Sea Chanties"" and ""23 Glee Club Favorites"", the latter setting a standard never equaled."
4,Very Satisfied,Shipment was faster then I expected and the CD was in excellent condition. I am very pleased with the product.
1,Displeased,"The hay is rough and stiff, so it doesn't work very well as food or bedding. It hurts to grab a handful and feels like very dry straw, so I can't imagine that my pet was thrilled to have it shoved it its cage. A large portion of the bottom of the bag is unusable ""dust"" because it is very brittle and packed very tight. It also left crumbly dust mess in the cage as well. My bunny ate it, but picked out the softer bits and left the majority of the hay untouched. The way he dug in it with his face made me concerned that he would jab himself with a pointy piece and hurt himself. This stuff is not amazing quality like they lead you to believe. I thought all timothy hay would be/feel the same, but I tried a different brand and it was much better quality."
4,2005 Sunfire speakers,"These speakers are O.E.M, A.C. Delco made in China. Why they are made in China or for how long Delco has been using China to make their parts I do not know. The speakers sound great, I'm glad I replaced them, I just wish more American made parts were available."
5,Great book!,Bought this for my husband in prep for a fishing trip to The Beaverkill. He loved the book and just got back from the trip. He felt that the info in the book was was extremely useful and it was enjoyable to read. Well worth buying!
3,Uncalled-for Remake,"This is a beautiful work, musically as well as for those who appreciate dramatic readings from the Bible. My problem with it is wondering WHY was it done? In 1986 Wakeman recorded THE GOSPELS (reissued on CD as THE WORD AND THE GOSPELS) with The Eton College Choir, tenor Ramon Remedios, and narrator Robert Powell (the star of the JESUS OF NAZARETH TV-miniseries!). A glorious work clocking in at 86:32. At 97:32, this 1995 redo is just too long; rearranging certain tracks seem to make it drag longer than it already does, and while Remedios returned in fine form I'm afraid narrator Garfield Morgan just doesn't match the original. For Wakeman ""completists"" only; all others I suggest search out the earlier album, his first and still perhaps best ""spiritual""/""religious"" project."
2,Hope unrealized,"I had high hopes for this recording as well as Prayers. Neither met my expectations. Perhaps with an all professional line-up I might have been more impressed but aspects of both recordings seemed a little slap-dash and under produced.Still, I listen to it from time to time. Wakeman is the best but I hope he develops similar works with full-blown production methods and personnel. He has and can do better."
1,Don't bother,I am both a Christian and Wakeman fan but I returned this CD after one listen. Listen to the tracks provided by Amazon to get a sense of the music.
3,Fairly good vamp novel,"i love vampires so i was drawn to this novel. i definitely got sucked in but it wasn't what i call an ""easy read"" because of the victorian age language in it. it's not something i'd sit and read for hours at a time but definitely enjoyable. i'm looking forward to the next 2 novels."
1,not worth the money!!!!,"If you're looking for guidance for sushi making, this is definitely not it!!!This video has one revolution as it's moto. The ""wild and exotic"" idea that you can make sushi at home instead of speanding cash at a restaurant. And they keep repeating this concept during the video.Well, duh! I already assumed that when I purchased the video.So what you get here is NO recipies, NO guidlines, NO techniques. Nothing!!! Just a bad home movie style, long commercial for their website!!! And I paid money for it!A total disappointment."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I must agree with the previous reviewer, Don't wast your money on this video. It is just an advertisment for their web site."
1,WORST VACUUM - Don't review it until you use it a while!!!,"Seriously, people are reviewing this under the influence of Eureka payola, or are using it minimally and then glowingly gushing... Because it plainly is A LEMON. I've read numerous reviews online and people who have used it for more than a month are consistently saying the same thing - it's garbage. It initially picks everything up, works wonders with pet hair, etc. Then it gradually starts to deteriorate, regardless of high maintenance, cleaning, belt replacement, etc. Eureka's answer to this is no answer, or something ridiculous like ""never lower the height adjuster."" Plain and simple, this vac should be recalled."
1,"Let me join in on the ""This product SUCKS (not really)"" joke","I bought this vac before I read the reviews on Amazon, and when I saw it had a 2 star rating, I knew I had just wasted some money. Anyways, at first it really worked great, I thought my fears may have been unfounded. I made sure after each use to clean the filters completely so as to not give this 'fragile' machine anything to choke on. Anyway, about a month and a half after I bought it, it lost 90% of its suction power. I grabbed it, and like another reviewer on here, sent it slamming into a dumpster. I will NEVER own another eureka as long as I can vacuum my own floors. But hey, they sure made it look pretty. They figured out how to polish a turd. I now own a Hoover, and it has been doing really well. But yea, this vacuum doesnt suck, it BLOWS."
1,My Eureka spits out dirt from behind,"I bought one a few months ago. It looks good but doesn't clean well. It spits out dirt behind. So after completing vacuum with this one, we have to do a second round with a handheld vacuum picking dirt that Eureka spit out. I am fed up. Will throw out mine and buy from another manufacturer."
4,Works for me...,"All the other bad reviews kinda amaze me, this thing works good.Great for cat hair and wood floors."
5,LOVE LOVE this Vacuum!!!!!,"This is an amazing vacuum. It picks up things I never even knew where in my carpets . With 3 active kids a definite must.We've had it for about a month and I have absolutly NO complaints. It picks up great,the filters are easy to clean ( a comment about the person with the dog hair problem-- the area that you reached up into was actually another filter.All you had to do to empty it was to unscrew it. This was pointed out to me by my son.)and the long cord is a plus.Okay,maybe one little complaint. The duster/cleaner is useless.That being said I still love this vacuum ."
1,Don't bother,"This vacuum is terrible. The suction is routed through the hose at all times, whether you're using the hose attachment or using the vacuum as an upright. No matter how diligent you are about keeping the filter clean and the canister emptied, the hose clogs constantly. Once it does, the brush just creates dust bunnies that it then deposits all over the carpet. I've had to take it apart a half dozen times to clean the dust and carpet fiber out of the hose. I plan to toss this thing in the trash. I sincerely hope that no one else in the world buys this vacuum."
1,Deserves a Zero,This product is such a waste of money. It does not have any suction. The only thing it does is spin the brush. Do not buy this vacuum. I'm stuck using my handheld vacuum to clean the whole house until we can afford a new and better upright vacuum. I'm so angry!
2,Disappointed,"This vacuum requires a lot of (dirty) maintenance. If you do not clean the filter, hose and dust catcher before each use it just throws what it is picking up out behind it. I have mostly hardwood floors with large area rugs. I dust the hardwood floors AFTER I am done vacuuming and pick lint up off the carpets. I loved it the first few months that I had it, but it is going downhill quickly. I am moving this one to the basement and going back to Kenmore.....sorry"
1,This is NOT a quality vacuum,"I agree with most other reviewers, this vacuum was a piece of junk. At first, it seemed like it was doing a great job picking up all of the pet hair, but the belt broke several times within my first year of owning it and I was constantly maintaining the vacuum. Now, after having it less than 2 years, the brushroll has warped the plastic bottom piece rendering the vacuum entirely useless. A complete waste of money, don't buy it."
1,Absolutely awful!,It's not worth the dirt it doesn't pick up. My feet and the vaccuum itself is covered in more dirt than is in it.
1,Eureka Altima Bagless Upright Vacuum 2996AVZ,"This Product is CRAP...I have purchase many vacuums in my days, but this one takes the cake. Eureka themselves will not help you in any way except to ask you to buy accessories to possibly help you. If you can get it to vacuum carpet without getting clogged or the hose coming up plugged if you have any other flooring around carpet you will need another vacuum to vacuum that flooring up for the Eureka will spit lint all over it and will not pick it up. DO NOT PURCHASE...TRUST ME"
1,worst vacuum ever,"When I bought this vacuum it made a smell while turned on.My husband thought that it was a ""new vacuum"" smell that would go away.After a few months the smell got much worse and now it smells like burning plastic. I am going to throw the vacuum away.It is impossible to vacuum bare floor with this vacuum, because it throws dirt and particles back on the floor.The only thing I liked about it, that it picked up hair very well.This vacuum is much worse than the cheaper ones I previously owned.Don't waste your money on it!"
1,Outrageously bad,"I've had two inexpensive Eureka Bosses previously that were great, but decided to try this Altima model. It is a fool's bargain. We have no pets, just normal carpeting and kids' crumbs. This vacuum spits everything back out after the first minute or two. The hose is set too low, so you have to wrestle to use it, it doesn't reach anything, and causes the vacuum to tip over. When you're not using the hose, it pops loose every time. I can't believe this is a Eureka product."
1,Dont waste your money!,Please do not buy this vacuum! When you first buy it and get it home it work perfect. But after about 3 months everything goes right down hill. It starts to lose suction power and doesnt go from carpet to hard wood or bare floors at all. I try to not use my vacuum as much as I can because it is just a mess to clean up after it. Please dont waste your money! Always read the reviews first!
1,Hate this Vac!,"Bought this vac at Kohls for my mothers day gift, and what a disappointment! I too thought after the first use that it was great, but now...after replacing 2 belts and spitting dirt, clogs easily and I am hating bagless. Now my vaccuum will make the room smell like smoke and then like crap. Don't waste your money... I am now looking to see what is recommended and there is another Eureka 4870MZ, but now I am a little skeptical. Thoughts?KazFresno CA"
1,Eureka 2996AVZ Altima Bagless Upright Vacuum,"Eureka should refund the purchase price of this piece of junk!!! It is completely unacceptable - poor quality, failure to perform in any satisfactory manner, clogs constantly, can't handle even the most minimum level of dog hair and cat hair. Completely useless!!!"
2,Eureka Altima .....problems from day one,"Dont waste your money on this one...it clogs very,very easily and the filter is filthy and messy when you have to clean it.I've had to begin removing the filter outside of the house because the dirt flies all over.Now its spitting the dirt back out at my legs and the belt broke in week 3.Saw it at Best Buy and thought the removable duster was kind of novel and practical,but any feather duster would be the the same as I found out later,and wasnt worth a higher price.Ended up removing it and its now residing on a shelf.Next time I'll do my homework and not buy into pretty colors and gimmicks.This $128.00 vacuum will end up in the dumpster as soon as the Dirt Devil Vibe I ordered gets here !"
1,Piece of Junk,"Clogs constantly, belt smokes after using it like three times. Not worth it, find another vacuum this one is not worth the aggravation."
1,This vacuum is horrible,I have owned this vacuum for only a couple of months and already the suction is so poor. There is almost no suction in the hose it hardly picks up anything and the suction is so bad in the hose that the stair cleaner attachment is useless and does absolutely nothing when attached. It worked great when it was brand new but has faded fast. I have taked care of it and dumped the container often as well as cleaned off the brush roll but still this vacuum is pretty useless and was a big waste of money.
1,Get a broom too!,"Better TogetherBuy this item with:Little Helper Broom SetYeah you'll need a broom too. This vacuum tosses dust and dirt around the room in stead of picking it up. Oh yeah, it's flimsy too. Mine broke within 90 days. This was a horrible purchase."
1,Vacuums that don't suck SUCK!,"I hate this vacuum. What a waste of money. It has such a convoluted path from the bottom of the vacuum to the final dirt canister that it is CONSTANTLY getting clogged up. I mean that every two or three times we vacuum, the dang thing has to be taken all apart. I HATE HATE HATE it. It doesn't suck stuff from the carpet, and if by some chance it DOES suck stuff up, it spits it right back out.This was an impulse buy at Kohl's one day -- I'll never again buy something without researching it first with consumer reports or at least here on Amazon. Lesson learned."
1,Horrible purchase,"Do NOT buy this vacuum, unless you want to waste your money on something that throws all the dirt and dust back at your feet. I've had this vacuum for about 3 months now, religiously cleaned the filters, and it just belches dirt and dust everywhere it goes. One of the worst purchases I've made."
1,The world's most expensive dirt mover,"I have never regretted buying anything as much as this vacuum ""cleaner"". It excels only in moving around dirt and dust, it clogs and is rendered useless after only 1 use even though the dirt receptor is not even close to being filled. The duster and powerpaw attachments are a joke. I wish that 0 stars was an option. I kid you not that it is now in the dumptster where it belongs."
2,This Eureka vacuum,"This vacuum has a problem after it has it has been used a while. It clogs after a few weeks use. I cannot recommend it. Buy something else. Eureka, get your products right! Test them first for a month or more to see how they work. This one spits dirt back when used a month or more."
1,To Suck or Not to Suck...,"DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM CLEANER!!!!! It worked great after one use. I am now looking for a new vacuum cleaner. It throws dirt around rather than sucks it up. I wouldn't even donate this one to charity, that is how bad it really is."
2,Cleans great but....,"I bought this today from Costco for 99.00 and easily assembled it with the instructions in about 10 minutes. I started to vacuum my house and was absolutley amazed at how much it was picking up, and how much my old one left behind. About 5 minutes after I started the hepa filter & cover came flying off the front of the vacuum. I put it back on double checking it, and emptied the dirt and cleaned the foam filter. I started again and the hepa filter flew off within 30 seconds. It just won't stay on any longer. I also found that the tube extension for the hose fell of alot, so I turned it over thinking I had it on upside down, but only to find it came off again very easily.Bottom line, I love the way it cleans, but with parts falling off the first 10 minutes I am going to return it to Costco tomorrow to try another model or brand."
1,Can't handle dog hair - waste of money,"The other reviews are obviously from employees of Eureka. This vacuum can't handle dog hair at all and whoever engineered the thing should be fired. We have 3 dogs, plenty of dog hair and the only rugs we have to vacuum are throw rugs. We just bought ours at Costco and the third time I used it I noticed a major problem. As I was emptying the canister, I noticed some hair lodged where the dirt and hair flow into the canister. As I reached up and around to pull it out (the area behind the filter is only about a fingers width deep which is the problem), I literally pulled out another canister full of dog hair that was lodged. Note: I did turn on the vacuum first to see if the lodged hair would blow out and it didn't.Can't return it to Costco fast enough."
5,Wonderful machine!!!!,"For the money, this vacuum cleaner sucks up more dirt than the pricer models. I wish I had bought this one sooner. I love it and my carpet has never looked better."
2,OK for the price,"I have had this now for 2 years. It picks up ok, we have a dog so it gets a ot of dog hair. The hose doesn't work well, there is very little suction. You always have to clean the filters just about everytime you use it so you will have full power. I tried a Dyson after I used this very good on my carpet and the Dyson picked up a little bit that the Eureka didn't but for the price I'm not going to run out and get an Dyson.I would stay away from this vacuum, I would not buy this again."
1,"Starts out great, but didn't last 9 months","I bought this vacuum thinking that at the price I would be happy if it lasted a year. It didn't even last 9 months. It started out great. It did a better job than any expensive vacuum I've owned and the dirt cup is super easy to empty. The suction was phenomenal and my carpets looked and felt great after using it. It was effortless to use. It pretty much propelled itself. After about 6 months the vacuum stopped moving by itself, taking more effort to push it, and the suction was not as good. Even though I had always kept the filter clean and made sure there were no blockages, the problems persisted. I kept using it because it still picked up dirt and I really, really loved the vacuum since it was so easy to empty and even picked up dirt from the side edges. I had to finally give it up, after using it about 7 months, because it started smoking. The motor just burned up. It was a real disappointment because it worked so well in the beginning."
1,Junk,"This thing has been spewing dust and dirt out behind it every time I run it. I find myself re-vacuuming areas of floor I just went over until I give up. It started smoking, too, and smells horrible. A quick google search today informs me I'm not alone.This is junk. Don't buy it."
1,Piece of Junk,"Do not buy this vacuum. I have had one for a year now. Within the first few months power brush attached stopped working , the lock that holds it upright has broken. I have disassembled numerous times to clean it out and within the next use it is blowing the recently vacuumed dirt back onto the floor. It has to the most poorly built vacuum I have ever seen."
1,Worst vacuum I've ever owned,"This vacuum worked for a few uses, then stopped sucking. I do not use it frequently as we have hard surfaces in most of our rooms; however, I've cleaned the filters and dump the dirt cup frequently, to no avail. We do not even have pet hair in our home to clog it up. This is by far the worst vacuum I've ever owned (Hoover & Dirt Devil being the other brands). I'm now looking into an Oreck instead! I wish I'd have saved my $100 or so and put it toward the Oreck in the first place!! I would NOT recommend this product at all!!"
1,Just say NO to Eureka,"What an AWFUL vacuum. Well, you get what you pay for I guess. We put up with it for 2 years because money was tight. What a joke!We have two basset hounds who shed all year, this ""vacuum"" would merely flatten the dog hair into the carpet and pick up only a fraction of it. The ""filter"" would need to be cleaned after each use otherwise there was little to no suction. The cup was gross, we will never use bagless again, dust everywhere! Bought a Kenmore upright with hepa filter bags a month ago. Worth its weight in gold!Just say no to the Altima by Eureka, save yourself the hassel and throw down a few more dollars and buy a REAL vacuum."
5,Inspiring,A new technique for me. Totally different way to paint then I am used to...great instruction and lots of good information and illustrations.
3,Pales in comparison,"I'd read and loved the previous book in this series directly before reading this one, and unfortunately this one suffered from the comparison. To be fair, I'm sure the quality of the story and the writing were at the same level as the other book, but I strongly disliked the main character (I don't really even want to call her a ""heroine""). She wasn't a good person, which made it difficult to want her to find happiness, which is the point of reading a romantic novel, after all."
2,Folly's Bride,The book seemed rather sluggish after the start. I could not identify with Sara Leighton. She seems very fickle and ungrateful. She foreshadows the bittersweet time and a life of simplicity and the dawn of a new era.
4,Great characterization of Sara--but where's the romance?,"Although this is not my favorite Montclair book, I really enjoyed Sara's story because I had read Book 6 before reading any of the others in this series. Reading Folly's Bride helped me understand Sara much better--she seemed so stiff and cold in Gallant Bride with so little sympathy for Blythe. But I grew to like Sara even if she isn't the most likable Montrose bride. She's honest and real--her flaws are obvious to the reader. Even though she is no Kate Cameron who is naturally at ease with everyone, Sara just has a harder time being vulnerable. She's not shy, but she is definitely reserved.I really enjoyed the characterization of Sara, but I wished I could have seen more of Clayborn besides his love for his bride. We didn't see much else of him, and I couldn't understand the romance. The romance between them seemed stilted even when everything got better at the end. Clayborn's character was still a mystery at the end."
1,Not Fit Correctly,The Compatibility Chart for this wiper clear stated on page 4 that it fits the 2003 Jeep Liberty. The wiper doe not correctly secure to rear window wiper arm of my 2003 Jeep Liberty. It can be secured to the arm with a zip tie but this is an unacceptable method.If you have 2003 Jeep Liberty do not buy this item expecting it to fit as stated in the compatibility chart
2,Disappointed,"I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window. It only has about 8"" of contact. I will not purchase this again."
1,Missing Parts,This wiper blade was an open package and missing the plastic adapters. I cant buy it locally and cost to much to return. Very disapointing.
1,medal of honor airborne,I have never given a negative review until I received this game. It goes to about the 3rd level of the game and stops. Obviously this item sold is a defective model!!
3,No 4 players :(,"the previous virsions were very nice because it had 4 players option, but unfortunatly this virsion dont have the 4 player option and that make this virsion boring."
3,"Good, but not great","I have bought nearly every game in the Medal of Honor series and I've always enjoyed them. For the PS3, I was expecting something really stellar, but I was kinda disappointed. The graphics look like PS2. If you've played Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, then you know what kind of graphics the PS3 is capable of. I guess COD 4 has spoiled me for all future FPS games. The makers of the Medal of Honor series should study that game and give us something truly mind-blowing next time."
3,Great but could've been better,"Since this game came out the same year COD4 came out, it is reasonable to compare these two games. The graphic for MOHA is great, but not as good as COD4, at time, I feel the graphics kinda jumpy, probably due to the frame rate? It is claimed non-linear game play, however, it is easy to get lost which can lead to frustration. The weapon upgrade is kinda fun. AI was smarter than the ones in COD4. Overall, it is a fun, re-playable game."
5,James Cleveland Songs with the World's Greatest Choirs,"I LOST THE FIRST CD, BUT I WILL KEEP UP WITH THIS ONE. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST GOSPEL RECORDINGS OF JAMES CLEVELAND. THANK U AMAZON.COM"
3,the C.D. has very good audio sound quality,"some of the song's on the C.D. weren't recorded from the very begining such as ""I don't feel noways tried"" the song starts from the middle of the original live album as well as other song's on the disc, but music lover's will be robbed of some of the very good song's that he has recored."
2,Missing email...,I had to purchase this book for a class in college. I first bought a used copy only to find out the code wouldn't work and then bought the Kindle version. The email that I was promised has still not arrived and I cannot find anyone to contact about it. Now to take the survey the company wants me to pay $10. I refuse to do this because I already purchased the book that should have given me a code. Frustrated. Anyone know who to contact?
2,Not a keeper,"I wasn't really impressed with this item. It just seemed a little too gimicky in my opinion. I start student teaching in a few days, and this book is not something that is going to really help me. I would pass this one over."
3,"Great condition, but not what I expected.","It said the book was new. However, when I received it I realized it was missing the key to the online program. This was a huge disappointment and I ended up having to purchase a second copy."
2,Teach your strengths,didn't come with the test~already used test code so not much good to my daughter ..
4,Teach with your strengths,"Teach with your strengths is focused on a strategy of self-discovery first, teaching methodologies second. This may disappoint many who are looking for easy answers to becoming better teachers. However, I found it quite revealing and useful as an adult who teaches innovation and creativity in my professional life, and as an adult who teaches Christianity to adults in my personal life. The Gallup folks are trying to start a positive revolution in many people's lives by focusing on our strengths. Teachers are the prime movers and shakers in that revolution. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to even further materials from Gallup and these authors."
1,Disappointment,"While the book contains some valuable information, it is of little value without the accompanying survey. The promised email containing the URL and password required for the survey never arrived. Without that information, the book is rather useless."
2,"If you buy this used, you probably won't be able to access strengthsfinders website to evaluate your own personal strengths.",I haven't even started the book and wanted to begin with checking out my strenghts but the insert with the code (good for only one user) wasn't included in this book. Now I feel cheated. I'll have to buy the book new to get the code and evaluate my strengths.
3,It is tiny!,"I didn't realize how tiny this colander is when I ordered it. It is fine for rinsing a few strawberries, and it is durable, just be aware that it is TINY! Not for draining spaghetti ;)"
3,What a mix up.,"I bought this 3 CD set, or at least I thought I did. Who ever puts these together needs to get their act straigtened out. The label on the first disc is for Spirit of the Wind; however, that is not what was on the disc. It was Spiritland which is not even suppose to be in the set. The label on the second disc was for Native Spirit, but again that is not what was on the disc. It was Spirit of the Wind. The 3rd disc was the only one that had on it what it was suppose to have; that is Cries from the Earth. The music on the two discs that were suppose to come with the set was good and what I expected. None of the CDs however were Native Spirit. The CD Spiritland is suppose to be a CD of ""soothing sounds"", but I didn't find them soothing at all not to mention that it wasn't even suppose to be included. I think you will like the musicians, but they need to get a new recording company that can put together an album properly."
2,"A chore to read, boring.","The book was quite boring, lacking any real detail on tactics, politics, or anything of substance. Unfortunately, I can only say the book is boring and do not recommend it, despite the popular appeal of the movie starring Peter O'Toole."
4,Exciting and enjoyable,"Very different that the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" movie. An exciting and enjoyable first hand account of the arab revolt against Turkey in World War I. Although it's hard to keep track of who is who and what is where, the writing and descriptions of the desert, the arabs and the action make it very worthwhile."
3,On Revolt in the Desert,"This text is an unnecessary abridgment of one of the most compelling and beautifully written non-fiction works of the 20th century, Seven Pillars of Wisdom. While fans and collectors of Lawrence's work may find the book of interest, new readers should disregard this text and direct their attention to Seven Pillars of Wisdom post-haste."
4,History repeats,"If we do not research and invest time in reviewing history, then we are doomed to repeat the same errors as before. This book gives an excellent view on the Arab culture, mannerism, and civil leadership in Middle Eastern society. TE Lawrence led an insurgent based campaign against the German backed Turkish Army. Well written and I found the book filled with interesting pieces that relate to the present. Subjects like the rules of modern warfare vs. insurgent tactics, the notice of Islamic fundementalism within the ranks of his men, the ability to lead lightly armed fighters against fortified positions. Good book that gives some insight to potential issues facing in that region today."
4,Nice stuff,"This 7"" is great but if can't hold a candle to there older stuff. If you don't have any older material I suggest you get it. Buy from a small business don't support this corportion who is trying to make music a comadity(Buying things in any way is counter-revolutinary, but a small business is at least a little better) Sorry i spell so horrible."
2,This certainly is the breakdown...,"if you love against me!, you won't like this, its boring its lost any of the actual passion that they had on the first ep and were vaguely holding onto on the full length. Theres too many added instruments and it comes off like he's trying to do some clash-esque throwback to reaggae or something. save your money and search for the first e.p., this might as well be considered dashboard confessionals venture into being 'hard', then Against Me!s celebration of getting onto a big ... label."
1,"Stick to what you Know - Order Plants, Flowers elsewhere","I was excite to order this as I am moving into a new home and looked forward to having blooming flowers on my table in a few weeks. The box arrives - and it's not pre-planted, instead there is a basket, several bags of dirt, a bag of moss and a paper bag filled with what I think are the bulbs. Not really preplanned more DIY. The best part, no directions! I have no idea what to do. I will have to research to find directions, not really what I have time for, but I am worried about the plants dying.Do not buy - no matter what the price."
2,Too hot!!!,"Bought this for my son and his wife. They hated it cause it kept sliding off the bed and when it did stay on it was too hot. Gee, I thought it was pretty."
5,Ceremonial inspiration,"Living in a region well known for its fine brass instrument musicians, the bride-to-be in our family was eager to find some suitable solo music for the wedding service. This CD provided many choices, all elegantly played with great feeling. Not only have we ample choices now, but we have also had many enjoyable hours of listening for sheer pleasure. The range is good, combining well-known favourites with others that we hadn't thought of. We appreciated the prompt delivery of the package in the post, too."
3,The Offer,"Although the plot got off to a good start, I was disappointed in the hero's moral character. How he could initially be so gentle, and then turn selfish and self-gratifying was a bit far-fetched and extremely disappointing. I like the heroine, thought she was very funny and sweet, butI would have preferred that she ended up with Richard, the hero's friend and a notorious rake. At least he seemed genuinely interested in making the heroine happy!"
2,Interesting but the hero goes off course,"Catherine Coulter lets this story get a bit off course. When the hero Phillip finds and takes care of Sabrina for five days because of her illness and the snow storm leaving them trapped in a hunting cabin. During the time in the cabin he is very attentive and ready to protect her after he finds out her brother-in-law attemped to rape her but failed and still planned to do so later. When Philip finally succeeds in getting Sabrina to marry him for he compromises her by taking care of her the five days in the hunting cabin. He later becomes so insensitive to her feelings almost one step from being just like her brother-in-law when he physically hits her. I thought she went why off character then. The story redeems itself towards the end. I love her bride series and the Calypso Series, but this book left me lacking."
4,"typical, but I am left wondering...","I liked the story, but it seems like characters appear out of nowhere, (like Richard Clarendon, and Charles) that leave me wondering if the book is part of a trilogy or series. There is a feeling like walking into a movie part way through. I do like the fact that Catherine Coulter does not summarize the other stories in a series like so many other author's do, ruining the story if you did not start at the beginning. By accident I bought the Wild Baron, and it appears to be a paralel of The Offer, connected through Phillips friend Rohan Carrington. I wish that the trilogy's or series were identified more clearly. I like to read a whole group at once, but can't if I don't know what the other books are called. The Offer had no reference to the Wild Baron on its cover. I must say though, that I am addicted, as predictable as these books are they keep you turning the pages into the wee hours."
2,A terrible disappointment,"I was really disappointed after reading this book. I bought it expecting to have a romance, but it wasn't even! The author constantly made the heroine, Sabrina, sound desperate, skinny and very frail. And the hero, Phillip, proposed marriage to her in the beginning and them slept with his mistress on their wedding night! And to make matters even worse, she forgave him without a second thought. How this book came from the same author of ""Rebel Bride,"" which I loved, is beyond me."
1,Two Words: Oy Vey,"(If you don't know exactly what the title actually translates into, it means ""Oh pain""). Coulter had a good idea, I will have to give her that much. But she just didn't do anything with it. At least, not anything that would make for a good book. The hero is everything that a girl shouldn't want in a man: He keeps a mistress (I have no problem with rakes being the heroes in a book, but not when they have a mistress after marriage) and he actually hits the heroine. And aside from that, I can't see at all why the heroine supposedly loves him. His only saving grace is his looks and the fact that he saved her--not enough for this odd couple. And the ending left me totally confused. Whatever you do, DO NOT read this book."
1,Repetition,"the book is superficial and has the same plot in the beginning as MAD JACK, another of her books"
3,Really silly...,"I've never read a romance book with such a silly storyline before. Phillip (the hero) supposedly ""loves"" Sabrina (the heroine) but he does really stupid things...e.g. like going to have sex with his mistress on his/Sabrina's wedding night! Also, what a typical male chauvenistic pig he is! And before you know it... Voila! He suddenly discovers that he loves his wife and pledges his total loyalty to her (and that includes his womanizing ways)! I think this book shouldn't be classified under ""romance""... I'm sure the author could do better!"
2,Alright,THis book had it's good moments and it really did have potential. Yet some parts were so confusting and the hero of the story seemed to changed once he wasn't alone in the cabin with her. Some loose ends are never tied up as well. If you just need a bit of very light reading this is your book just don't expect too much.
2,This book was a comeplete disappointment,"Don't get me wrong, I love Coulter's books, but I must say that this book was the first time when I felt as if I had wasted my time and money on one of her books. It started well enough, but by the time Charles (Phillip's friend and some friend at that) discoverd them alone at the cottage I had lost all the interest that had felt in the beginning. All I really have to say is that if you want to read one of Coulter's books, your safest bet is the Maze or one of her other historical books which I am sure that you will like more than this one."
1,Probably the WORST book I've ever read...didn't even finish it,"This book was horrible! nothing intriguing about it. The ""hero"" was a total loser and cheats on her with his mistress, and she still ""loves"" him? WTF - I skimmed through the book and am glad I didn't invest in the whole thing, because it was a horrific mess. Not only was it the worst Catherine Coulter book I've ever read, but I think the WORST book I've EVER read by any author. Why would they think this would be fit to publish? what a waste of money.!"
3,"To the reader from New York, August 22, 1998","Richard Clarendon, Duke of Portsmouth, was the leading male character in Coulter's book The Deception, and I liked the book better than this one."
3,"Interesting, but somewhat confusing; lacks passion.","The book was interesting but somewhat confusing as there were too many characters and the love story never had a chance to truly develop -- one minute the lovers hold themselves apart; the next they're in love. There is a character in 'The Offer', Richard Clarendon that sounds like he would make an intersting leading man..."
5,"a truly moving, touching, can't put it down romance!","Coulter has out-done herself with this one. Read this book only if you have several hours, because you won't want to put it down!!! The characters come alive and you feel as if you are there with them."
5,Poetic Lyrics and Captivating Music,This is an excellent collection. Bruce has a knack for getting to the heart of world political matters through song. He does it with love and care and the soul of a poet.I highly recommend this CD. I am enjoying it very much.
2,Rips Off the Fans,"I'm sorry, but the strategy of releasing compilations consisting of old material plus one or two new tracks automatically earns a ""no Good"" rating from me.The fans are the reason artists can release these compilations in the first place. For newcomers, adding a couple of new tracks makes no difference: to them, all the tracks are new. No, they do this for one reason only -- to get fans to pony up full CD price for the two tracks they don't already own.This is the kind of marketing that has earned such contempt from the public, and this is the why file-sharing services thrive. I've been a Cockburn fan for a long, long time and I own every one of his albums. It's a real slap in the face to release two new songs and not make them available, except at exorbitant prices, to the people who have supported him throughout his career."
4,It's pronounced co-burn.,"I'm not the biggest Bruce Cockburn fan, so a singles collection made sense for me. What a great package. It's done what most ""hits"" albums are supposed to do: made me realize how many great songs this guy has.Through years of radio listening I knew a few tracks here of course. The biggie for me (and possibly his best known song?) was getting ""Lovers In A Dangerous Time"". Such great driving bass in that song. Much, much better than the Barenaked Ladies cover. Other highlights are ""Call It Democracy"", ""If I Had A Rocket Launcher"" and the smooth ""Dream Like Mine"". However my favorite song by far has come to be ""If A Tree Falls"". It always gets turned up. I always sing along.As intended this is perfect for the casual fan. A great place to begin, or end your BC collection."
3,"A greatest hits, but with misses","While it's always good to hear from the prolific Canadian songwriter, this hits collection certainly does not match the original hits collection, ""Waiting For A Miracle: Singles 1970 - 1987"", even if that collection doesn't bring you up to date. The remastering on ""A,A,A"" is very well done. Unfortunetely, the two new songs are pretty forgetable, and they don't mention a different version of ""The Problem With Normal"" which I wasn't a fan of. Also, where's ""Peggy's Kitchen Wall"" and ""You Pay Your Money And You Take Your Chance""? This collection also gets more of his political songs like ""If A Tree Falls"" which is fine if you like getting beaten over the head with songs like this. This is an adequate Cockburn retrospective, but my suggestion is track down the ""Miracle"" collection and the lovely, bluesy ""The Charity Of Night"" albums and you'd be set."
1,bad intro...,"Don't let the one star fool you, I am a big Bruce Cockburn(CO-BURN) fan. I am writing this primarily to those who may not be familiar with his work, and are considering this collection as an introduction. This is NOT a good album to start listening to Cockburn. Bruce has never really been a ""hit singles"" oriented artist. ""Wondering Where the Lions Are"" went to #24 on Billboard in 1980 and remains his only chart single to this day. Cockburn's artistry is far more evident in live performance, and any of his live albums would make a better intro. Better yet, check out his show if he is on tour. For studio albums, try some early 70s work like High Winds White Sky and Sunwheel Dance, or anything he's done since 1990. There are some good songs here (Night Train, Last Night of the World), but the eighties were not Bruce's best decade and some of the arrangements sound very cheesy now."
4,All the Good Stuff on One Disc,"Anything Anytime Anywhere: Singles 1979-2002 puts some of the best Bruce Cockburn songs all in one place. From early favorites like ""Wondering Where the Lions Are"" to more recent gems like ""Pacing the Cage"" and ""Last Night of the World,"" this album features a great mix of songs that are fairly well-known. The only song that I miss in this collection is ""One of the Best Ones."" Bruce's beautifully crafted lyrics and melodies make him an inspiration for burgeoning singer/songwriters like myself."
1,Buyer beware,"Buyer beware. The condition of the CD was described as ""very good,"" so I was disappointed when it arrived with a plain, slim-line cover and no liner notes, no song titles...nothing. The CD plays fine, but I don't think a product should be described as ""very good"" unless it is, as a minimum, complete and intact. Live and learn, as they say."
1,Herzog of pop,"I actually give this zero stars!!He is an example of the problem with heavy un-enlightened politics/ethics over riding music & art! With so much great music and brilliant inspired lyrics out there this can easily be avoided. Sometimes however people give you ""their"" music for your enlightenment. Thats how I ended up with some Bruce Cockburn and a few other musicians. They all share a mean undertone and poor musicality.Avoid and find real music."
5,It's Not Just the Basement - It's The Man!,"It Came From Bob's Basement is one of those books that I look at over and over again. Not only are the images terrific, but the writing is exceptional. Apart from Bob Burns' incomparable passion for these icons of science fiction culture, what really emerges for me is a very accurate portrayal of Mr. Burns' big heart and generosity. Bob's intention was never to make money from his collection but rather to be a museum director and caretaker of priceless relics that millions of people have seen in many of the world's greatest films. Now, with the publication of this book, everyone has an opportunity to see these items first hand and I would highly recommend they do so!"
2,Dynamic Thinking,"The reading does not flow smooth for me, it feels like the book does not want to be read. I did read the whole book though."
3,"PAINFUL! OUCH!!! That is, if you are a man like me...","My wife received this item as a Christmas gift. She loves the effects but we both agree that the heat from the wax is painful and difficult to fully enjoy. I normally could care less about these type of items as a typical guy, but my wife insisted that she was my elbows. We had a deal with some bargaining so I let her have her fun.Well, it is HOTTER than hades and I just can't appreciate the after effects. It was supposed to take some of the excess skin off and make it smoother (after she spent time pre-cleaning.) Seems as if I might have needed 3 treatments!!! I guess I don't see what the big ballyhoo is, but then again, I'm just a guy! ;-)For what it's worth, my wife likes the effects she received, but she wasn't thrilled with the pain of the heat. To each his/her own I reckon. We both wish it had a temperature control. I don't know if others have it or not but it sure would be nice!"
5,Spectacular Book,This was a great book and the recipes....SUPER YUM! Especially the Carrot Cake. It was easy to understand and had step-by-step instructions. A great book for the intermediate decorator.
2,For Experts Only,"It is obvious from the beginning that this book is meant for those with extensive experience in cake decorating. The reasons are:1. Recipes move back and forth between standard cup, tsp, tbsp measurements and oz for both dry goods and dairy products.2. Many of the recipes require prior knowledge of skill sets when things go wrong. Example, when the recipe for chocolate ganache required extra melting, you would have had to know about double boiling to make the recipe work.These are just a few of the issues I had with the book. It is beautifully illustrated, and contains great ideas for cakes, but don't count on her execution instructions."
2,Spectacular Cakes,The photograph on the front of book is pretty. One would expect the know-how or art of hand-crafting the green cymbidium orchids using modelling paste and colours. Why the use of fresh flowers or fruits to dress most of the cakes? Spectacular photographs but a so-so book. Am disappointed.
4,It Wasn't My Fault,"Murdley Gurdson suddenly has an egg laid on his head. The bird claims ""it wasn't my fault..."". Murdley and his new-found friends discover a humerous chain of events that led to the egg on Murdley's head.My daughter loved the illustrations and discovering how a simple chain of events can seriously impact your life. This book started quite a conversation on how we are ultimately responsible for what we do.The book was humerous and fun to read."
3,It Wasn&#65533;t My Fault,This is a funny story that will keep you guessing until the end. Whose fault was it that caused the bird to lay an egg on Murdley Gurdson's head? Was it Murdley's fault or the other animal's fault? The story continues on and is very funny. The ending may seem confusing but will only be obvious if you read the whole story. So until then you can only go by what I have written.Josh V.
