3,"Great sound, but the headphone cord can be annoying.","First of all, the sound alone is fantastic from these headphones, and def. worth the $33 I paid for these. However, this is hindered by the fact that the cord can be very annoying running behind your neck since that's how the cord is designed; and the cord can easily be tangled up and doesn't look too good when your wearing it when this happens. I would suggest getting another pair of headphones that that have simple hang down cords, unstead of having to wrap the one headphone cord around the back of your neck due to the uneven cords."
2,"Great sound, terrible quality","I have now owned 2 pairs of these headphones. They soind great, but they do not last!!! The rubber cord tends to melt away leaving exposed wire after less than 2 months. This then will give you a great little shock from time to time. eventually you will hear pops and cracks.I loved the sound and feel, but the quality of manufacturing was just crap, avoid these if you can."
4,Excellent earphones for a buck-twenty nine!,"Paid $1.29 after $30 coupon for signing up for Amazon Visa, in June 05. Amazing sound so far, and I'm quite impressed by the depth and clarity. I've not used them extensively enough to comment on the cord durability. I give it 4 stars since I've not had them long enough to experience any issues described by other reviewers yet.Update - 12/18/08:Thse earphones are still as good as ever, and the cord is still intact, thogh it has turned yellow in portions that are regularly in contact with the skin during workout (due to the sweat)."
3,"Good, but not good for running","These have great sound and love that they have different sized ear pieces. However, they do not go over my ear and do not stay on when I'm running."
3,"Nice, but cumbersome","I hated the stock earphones my iPod came with so I decided to upgrade to the Sonys. The sound quality is superior, the base and mid range are clearer, but the high end is still a little tinny. My main problem with the Sony MDR-EX81LP Bud-Style Stereo Earphones is the funny little hook thingys that go over your ear. They don't really fit right on my ears and I find I'm always adjusting them. If I were to buy another pair of earphones I'd get some without the little overhook deal."
3,"Don't buy white one, buy black","The sound is amazing. It is a great earphone except the cord(white) will not last more than 6 month!My friend bought the black one(same model,diferrent color) and it is still ok, and the cord still looking good.Mine has bare wire now. Dont buy white one, its beautiful but only for a few month!! Buy the black one."
1,This item is worthless for exercise,I bought these hoping they would stay in my ears while working out. They are worse than the standard ipod earphones. Completely useless.
2,Not so great....,"Flimsy plastic hoops over the ears don't fit snug enough on my smaller ears and are not adjustable at all so they just fall out - worse than ear-buds from that standpoint. Not much low end either.It seems there isn't much you can do other than keep buying earphones and trying them. No retailers let you try them on for obvious reasons. I read reviews and they were very positive for this product all around but I'm finding reviews on earphones in general don't seem to be very reliable. This was my 3rd pair of disapointing earphone products.Best fit for clip over the ear types I've found so far are the overpriced B&O; A8s - They're a bit heavy and the earbuds are a bit large for my ear-canals but the hoops are adjustable and have decent base. A lot to pay at $130, but what are you going to do... If I had to do it again I'd just buy the clunky over the head hoop type for my situation."
3,"Great sound, poor design","I had originally picked up a pair of Sony MDR-EX71SL earbuds and found they had phenominal sound, but a very poor design that made it nearly impossible to keep the them from getting pulled out of your ears. I purchased these MDR-EX81LP earbuds because they appeared to be the same drivers with ear hangers to rectify this problem. Although they definitely do stay in my ears better, the ear hangers were apparently designed for someone with huge elephant-sized ears. Anyone with small or even normal size ears will probably find that the hangers wind up sticking up 1/4"" or more above the top of your ears when the buds are inserted properly. Other than that, they sound pretty nice, but I thought the MDR-EX71SL's had deeper bass, and a louder fuller sound. Sony needs to invest more effort in the ergonomic design of their products."
4,Good value with caveat,"Overall, the MDR-EX81LP is a decent replacement over the Apple supplied earbuds that came with my iPod shuffle, but too much bass for my taste, the midrange is a little weak and vocals suffers. The hangers are a bit large for my ears and as such, don't fit snug around my ears, but they aren't falling off. After useing them for a couple of hours of listening, my ears don't feel fatigued. I would have liked the EX81LP's to be more 'neutral' sounding, but good value for what you pay."
1,Waste of $33.00,"Don't buy these. They worked fine for 3 weeks and the fit was great. Then the volume in the right ear all but disappeared- the left ear remained fine for two more weeks. Then it became irratic, sometimes ok but most of the time soft enough that I had to sit still to hear it. Since I use it when I exercise this was useless. Now it is over 30 days from purchase date and I no longer have the original packaging so this was a total loss."
1,Not Good for Smaller Ears,"I gave mine away. These do not fit smaller ears. (note all the raves are from men). If you can stick the buds into your ear as they are meant to be (like the EX51/71SLs), the wraparounds stick up and look silly suspended over your (my) ears, rendering the ear pieces superfulous. They aren't the easiest things to put on either and you must take care if you wear earrings. I recommend the EX51SL or EX71SLS which you just plug in and be on your way."
2,"If you run a lot, not for you","The ear piece is flimsy. Sound quality is good. I do a lot of running and the things kept on popping out of my ears, and if they don't stay in your ears you cannot hear the music, well you can but the quality drops from a 8 to a 1. I gave it to a friend of mine that just sits around and listens to music."
3,tiny shock...,I had it for 3 months and recently I noticed that after listening for awhile the left ear piece gives my ear a tiny electric shock... its kinda strange.. i thought it'll go away but it happened again. So I'm going to return it or get it replaced hopefully. I didn't get an extended warranty so don't know what will happen.
2,Three Defective Pairs,"I've gotten these three times from and within three weeks of gentle use, each ear bud started playing at two differnt levels. One, fine, the second about a third of the volume.They are very comfortable, but I did have some trouble fitting them. I guess I have smaller ears :) I could use them at the desk, but didn't work for me at the gym."
4,Good headphones for the right ears,"I keep buying this style cause they sound so good for the style, but the loops just dont fit around me ears right."
5,Sony MDR-EX81LP,"Great fit and sound. Does not work well with a cell phone adapter (2.5mm to 1.5mm). Do not buy for a cell phone, but only for a device that uses 2.5mm."
1,Not for small ears,"The title says it all - these are not good for small ears. They are not adjustable and they will just fall right off with the least movement, namely running. Sound seems fine, when the darn things are actually in and on my ears. Still looking for earbud headphones that will work for me."
2,"Great sound quality, low build quality.","The sound is great. I loved the sound I was getting from these headphones (I listen to music daily for hours at a time) and these really were compact, lightweight, comfortable in the ears. However, I used these headphones for about a month, and they broke. Very short lifespan. That is the reason for two stars. Don't buy these headphones."
2,disappointing sound quality,"The packaging is great, and the headphones come with different sizes of earbds, and a neat little carrying case.It is a very comfortable set to wear.All of which makes it a real pity that the sound quality is terrible - it sounds tinny. It has none of the quality of sound of the standard iPod earbuds.So I rate it 1 star for sound quality, but bumped it up one star for the package as a whole."
5,Fabulous Headphones!,"I just bought these as a gift for my brother, I've had them for almost 2 years now. These headphones produce a crisp, quality sound. I wear them when I run outside and the only drawback is that you cannot hear anything but the music that you are listening to. Someone could sneak up behind you and bonk you on the head and you'd never hear them coming if you had these headphones on! Ok, unlikely scenario, but the description should give you a good idea of how outside noise is completely eliminated. I highly recommend these headphones!"
4,Watch out for shock,"These head phones are great. The sound is clear and it fits great on the ear. It comes with three different ear bud size that allows you to change between them and use whatever is comfortable. However, there's one thing that I do not like about it. I worked in an office where there are carpet floors and since there's metal around the head phone near the ear buds, static electricity transfer up to the metal rods quite often. If you like your ears being shock or if you can keep your feet still then go for it. Just giving everybody a heads up..."
3,"Good, Bad, Ugly","I've bought this product more then I'd like.It's very good for a few months(usually long enough for the warranty to expire), and then one of the head phone will stop working.Buy at your own risk."
4,"Great Clarity, Well Built, But a Little Lacking in Bass","I originally bought the EX71-SLs which had spectacular sound quality and frontal-lobotomy-inspired design. I switched to these expecting the sound quality to be lower than the 71s--particularly the bass--and that has definitely been the case. The bass is clearly not as pronounced as the 71s, but that's not necessarily a terrible thing. Had I never heard the 71s, I wouldn't have anything to compare these to.However, the design, fit, and quality of these is muuuuuuch better than the 71s. Scale of 1-10, the sound quality of the 71s is a 10 and the 81s (these) are an 8 or so. But as for design, I would give these an 8 and the 71s a 3; so the nod definitely goes to the 81s."
2,"A nice set of earphones, but ....","I bought these earphones from Amazon, and used them religiously with an ipod shuffle while bicycling for exactly seven months. The sound quality was more than acceptable and the earphones were very comfortable. HOWEVER, they are no longer usable because the white coating on the wires has become sticky and has started to disintegrate, exposing the wires underneath. These earphones come only with a 90 day warranty from Sony. Sony will replace them with a refurbished pair for about the price of a new pair - $29.00. Previous reviewers have noted the same problem and suggested that Sony respond to this. They have. They have discontinued the product."
1,Not all that great,"The sound quality is excellent, don't get me wrong. These earphones put out clear treble, deep bass (without washing everything else out) and have a well balanced tone that I have not found in most other headphones I have used. The backround sound cancellation from the in-ear style is not perfect, but does a better job than most earphones. My biggest problem: the fit! I opted for the over-the-ear style because I thought it would be better for an active lifestyle, and this would be true if they actually fit me where my ears are. The length of the earpiece is not adjustable so if your ear varies at all from the size they make, they simply don't work. In my case (others may have different a experience) the actual ear piece almost hits my earlobe - almost an inch too far down for these to fit right. Huge mistake not making them adjustable Sony. Bad Bad Bad design. It is a real shame because the sound quality would have made these some of the best headphones I have used."
2,Terrible design and fit,Sony is trying to be unique in this design but I have a problem with the fitting and the rubber around the wire started to unravel after couple months of usage. I am disatisfied with this product.
4,These are great for $30.,"Great sound and a great case. The carrying case I got with mine is a white oval hard case that fits the earphones great and also contains one pair each of small, medium, and large earbuds. After wearing them for over an hour, they get a little uncomfortable. I have no comment on the longevity, but after 2 months of light use, mine are still like new."
4,Quite good earbuds considering the price.,"Very good earbuds, considering the small price. Sounds excellent in everything except rock; a guitar sounds really loud and scratchy. I consider the case that comes with these to be useless. Overall a very good product."
3,Absolutely wonderful!,"These headphones are exceptional. The different size buds make it a snug fit for anyone. However, the thing that goes behind your ear is rather annoying so before purchasing these check out the Sony Headphone w/out the weird back thingy."
3,headphones,"I found that when I ran they did not stay in place. The suction pads in my ear didn't move, but the actual ear wraps were constantly out of place an I found it hard to focus on running."
2,Great....Until they fall apart...,"The headphones have great sound quality, and if your ears are the right size, fit on you perfectly.But if you use them alot, they quickly fall apart and break (and thats from daily use, not from abuse). The cord is made out of some fabric that, as another reviewer said, almost seems to dissolve. It's like a stretchy form of rubber that quickly splits and rips.And where the cord meets the actual rubber that goes behind your ear, the cord rips and breaks off from the earbud, and the only thing keeping it intact is the wire itself.These seem like headphones that were designed for short, short use. I got about 2 months use out of them, and am extremely mad that this has happened so soon. for even 30$, its just not worth your time."
2,Don't bother,"The sound quality is tinny. The treble range is fine, but the bass response is absurdly bad. To listen with these things is like leaving out entire instruments. So if all you listen to are, I dunno, flutes, go ahead and buy them. But for normal music, they're really not even better than the standard iPod headphones."
3,Need oversized ears to go with these,"The over-the-ear loop is oversized and fails at securing the earbuds on your ear because of its large size. The MDR-EX71SLs work much, much better. For me the over-the-ear loop makes these impossible to wear.Once you finish fumbling and get them in your ear canal, however precariously, the sound is great."
1,"Decent sound, but very poor quality materials","I was very happy with these headphones initially. Sound is pretty good for cost and they are very comfortable to wear. Having purchased Sony's previous in-ear fontopia designs, I was very excited to have some that would work well for exercising. My previous complaint being the they would fall out of your ears. Whatever material they are using on these headphones begins to disintegrate about a month after purchase. Whether this is caused by sweat from working or not, I don't know. Buyer beware. My headphones have been reduced to bare wire."
1,They don't stay on/in your ears,I never even got a chance to listen to music through these headphones. I couldn't get them to stay in/on my ears. The loops that go around your ear are huge and just make them more cumbersome. These may fit men with bigger ears better but I wouldn't recommend them for females.
2,"save your $$, don't purchase these","I've been purchasing from amazon for years but this is my first review. After reading all of the other reviews on this product I decided they would be the solution for running w/ my iPod as the stock apple earbuds just fall out. Well, these do not adjust in any way so you'd better hope your ears are the same shape and size as they'd designed these for. they're very uncomfortable and keep slipping.. plus the sound SUCKS. Other reviewers said the bass response was great. Bologna. sounds like crap. You have to shove these way way into your ear canal to get the bass but they don't stay put there and again more discomfort. I hate em. waste of money."
1,"2 pair earphones, defective, customer service poor","Bought 2 pair as iPod gifts based on positive experience with this model. Both quickly turned defective. Imbalance of sound, one side significantly weaker than other. Device is not cause. Amazon replaced 1st pair (slow service) after aggravating phone call to non-U.S. call center. Language skills and phone call noise objectionable. Now waiting several weeks for Amazon to credit $ return on 2nd pair. A shame that quality control has slipped on this item. Used to be good. Note there are ""refurbs"" of this product available at clearance spots. Good luck getting a good pair. Bottom line: 2 pair earphones, defective, customer service poor, Amazon and Sony need to do better."
5,Sony MDR-EX81LPEARPHONES ARE THE BEST!,THESE EARPHONES ARE SO LIGHT YOU FORGET YOU ARE WEARING THEM. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE.E. FIELD
1,what good it can be if it causes hearing loss?,"I loved this headphones. They were the excellent iPod headphones replacements. They have got fabulous reviews. But just do a google search typing ear buds hear. All serious studies done by different universities and doctors are concluding that that due to how close the ear-buds are present to the eardrum, they effectively magnify the sound by between 6 and 9 decibels compared with traditional over-ear headphones. Unlike headphones that go around the ear, these go inside the ear canal and can be louder because you're projecting that sound into a much smaller cavity with the ear speakers closer to your inner ear where we have a delicate system of sensory cells that are responsible for initiating the hearing process. Those cells are very, very sensitive to noise damage. Earbuds allow sounds in the environment to leak in, often causing the user to turn up the volume."
2,Not recommended,"I bought these earphones for my mp3 player. I just have one question. Where's the bass? The bass is pretty much nonexistent. The crummy earphones that came with my mp3 were a lot better than these. Awesome design but without the sound, it's just an expensive paperweight. Not recommended at all."
2,Good for talk shows only!,"I bought these for $30 at the same time I bought some Koss Sport Clip 'phones (KSC75) for around $13, and the Koss sound MUCH better than these! I can't even listen to music with the Sony Earphones, it is so tinny. They can only be used for talk radio, and then...they are marginal. So...beware."
2,Not good for smaller ears.,"After trying these out for 3 weeks, I dislike them.For the gym: They don't sit in your ear very well if you're running, and you need to push them back in when they are getting loose.If you're just sitting around, they are ok, but they still seem to fall out. The flaw in the design is that the piece that goes behind your ear is non-conforming. This means that it retains the shape it had when it came out of the box. When I bought these, I thought the could be bent to stay in a certain shape, but that didn't hold true.I've tried these along with other Sony portable headphones, like the MDR-G73LP - never buying any more Sony's again! They always seems to miss something that makes it annoying. I'll try buying those over-the-ear Koss headphones instead..."
1,"Awful, Do not Buy","These earbuds are absolutely terrible. First, the wires constantly tangle. I bought these f-ing things so that I could stay motivated while exercising. But it's a real morale killer to spend about 3 or 4 minutes getting them untangled before ever getting a chance to use them. But this is assuming they are products you WANT to use. In the past I had used these earbuds while lifting weights. Under such circumstances, the experience is awful. Not only do they come out of your ears when you perform any slight movement, but since the wire is meant to hang around your head (and thus, behind your back), good luck trying to lie down or sit back against anything. AWFUL!For the first time tonight, I decided to run with my mp3 player. Every few minutes, I had to fidget with the ear piece so the buds would stay in my ears. No one should have to endure this BS from a product that is meant to enhance their listening experience. Enough is enough. I'm getting new earbuds. DO NOT BUY THESE!"
4,Not as good as I expected,"I got an ipod several month ago, and want to boost the bass for my music, so I decide to got this new set of headset. It sounds good and clear, but according to the bass, it's really not as good as my original ipod set."
3,Sony MDR-EX81LP,"I bought these based upon positive reviews from various sources. For the money, the sound is fantastic with plenty of low frequency response. I have a couple complaints though...first of all I don't find them to be very comfortable and second they don't stay in my ear very well. I think that is a problem with many in-ear headphones available. I have heard that SHURE brand in-ear headphones have a foam type earpiece and work very well....but they are also very expensive. If the Sony's would fit better I would highly recommend them....but for me they just don't do the trick!"
3,Believe the other reviews about fragile wires!!!!,"I thought maybe the other reviews had a bad batch or something. But sure enough after a couple uses, the wires started to wear through to the copper. No good. They were comfortable and nice while they lasted though~!"
1,not meant for small ears,"I have very small ears and have a hard time finding headphones that stay in my ears, so I thought with the wrap-around that it would stay in place, but the section that goes from the earbud to the wrap-around is WAY too long and the wrap-around part was sticking way above my ear and instantly fell off. I would not recommend these if you have small ears."
2,"Second pair of MDREX81LP earbuds goes kaput! Thanks, Sony!","There are two good reasons NOT to buy these headphones: 1) they may very well fail without cause, as two pairs I've own have failed; and 2) SONY is so contemptuous of their customers that they offer to replace your defective $30 headphones with a `reconditioned' pair for $25. What a deal!Do yourself a favor before buying: consider my experience with SONY repair. I mailed in my bum buds - the second pair that failed - but I objected to SONY's pricing. Surely they have a better deal to offer? Nope. SONY shipped back my buds complete with torn packaging and internal routing crap. Oh - and they invited me to get back to them: ""It would be our pleasure to accept a major credit card.""I bet: $25 for used headphones with no cut to the retail middleman. This is SONY standing behind its product. ""You're on your own, sucker."""
2,They work fine before they break!!,"I've owned two pairs of these earbuds, one in white, one in black. In each pair, the left earbud has stopped working in less than a year (it's closer to nine months). That's almost 80 dollars I've spent on these headphones! The sound quality is acceptable and they stay in your ears nicely when working out, but watch out, they will inevitably break! I can't recommend these headphones unless you're ready to buy a new pair every year."
2,Great sound if they would stay on.,"These headphones sound great when they are in your ear, but if you are doing any thing other than sitting perfectly still they just fall out. The only good thing about the hook shape is they don't fall off you head completely. I personally find my self just wasting money on ear bud style headphones just to find they won't stay in my ear. I have about 8 different sets, I think it's time to go old school....."
1,"Poor design, good sound!","I like the quality of sound, but the Earphones do not stay in your ears well. For an item designed to stay in your ears, Sony really missed on these!"
2,Looks good but..,"Simply put, these seem like a great set of earphones just like the in ear model 71s but they didnt fit over the top of my ear. My thought was that these would be great for sports so as you ran along they would stay on. The post between the plastic ear band and the earphone is too long. I can only imagine how big ears have to be for these to fit on properly.They are great for sticking in your ear and cutting out backround noise and they sound great, they just dont fit and that is on many people."
2,Works great for 4 months,"Unlike other reviewers, this earphones fit my ears perfectly. I used it for indoor exercising 3 times a week. It sounded great too.Unfortunately, after 4 months, one of the earphone stopped working, and of course it's just out of the warranty time. I didn't expect such a poor quality from Sony. So, I rate it 2 stars."
2,"Great Sound, lousy coating",These and all the fontopia line sound great. The big problem is the rubber coating on the wire comes off easily. It feels like bubblegum.
3,Disappointed,"I bought this earphone a month ago and don't think it's good. It slips off too easily, even though I've tried the different sizes that are included. I suppose it depends much on your ear size and shape.I would recommend buying Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia instead."
1,The honeymoon is over,"Well, I was completely happy with these until the white material that wraps the cables started to dissolve! I don't know if it is because of daily use (I used extensively for commuting purpose every day) or if it is due to super-powerful sweat. Doubt that.Long story short, these worked fine for less than four months, and now with the white cords falling apart, they are completely unusable."
4,"""Even her freakish nipples are akimbo""","The line above (from ""Doubting Woman"") might be the best lyric ever written, or the worst. Or both. If you like it you might like Vic Chesnett, if not steer clear. I find a lot of great stuff on this CD: ""Gravity of the Situation"" is a brilliant song, and ""Thailand"" is an example of one where he breaks through the folk singer-songwriter groove and tries a little more sonic noise. I wish that Chesnutt wouldn't write all his songs with the same langorous, downbeat rhythm. A little variation would make it a better CD. But there's no question that the guy knows how to write lyrics."
5,It Works,"This works on my back stress and pains. I wish they sold it in local stores. I tried the Activon for arthritis and muscles for my back problems, but they do not work as well as the Activon specifically for the back. I don't know why it works so well. I will go out of my way to buy it."
4,mostly very good,"I especially love ""House of the Silent"" and ""Colder"". ""House of the Silent"" treats the experience of grief, and effectively captures a human heart at its best in the worst of times. ""Colder"" is more difficult to understand precisely what he is discussing, but it captures the feeling (for me) of breaking away from many things I had once valued and the turmoil that comes into old relationships, especially with one's elders, when one does that. I did not like the song rain. At first, I thought it was good, but then it occurred to me he was going on about totally devastating somebody emotionally, and the song was too upbeat and fast too come across as expressing remorse. I hate that kind of stuff, so I deleted that song. Overall, I think it is a very good album."
5,Awesome,"do yourself a favor and buy this cd...it's just amazing, incredible, catchy...it just rocks!! their best so far...if you like goth and metal, or just plain metal, go for it, you wont regret it..."
2,Expensive and a bit flimsy,Item looks more durable in the image but its actually pretty thin like a nylon windbreaker material. It is pack able but somewhat pricey for what you get.
3,Vera Cruz Hats the Myth,"The hat is awesome. Absolute shade and sun protection. Good looks, and a great size selection for X big heads.I live in New York where the summmer sun is strong but for only about 3 months. I used it nearly every day At the beach for about 3 years. Comes to about 250 times of 4 hour use. Did not really wash it the first year more than 10 times. Second year 20 times. Third year 30 times.The first half of these washings were by hand. The last were in the washing machine. AND THEN IT HAPPENED...,,,Next to the last wash a little frayed tear appeared. I thought maybe my cat was responsible. Then after the next wast, IT DISINTERGRATEDTHE ENTIRE DOME WAS GONE. $60 bucks you be the judge...was it worth it?????"
5,rubber clamp,Heavy duty. I used it to hold my ax and my 10 pound slugde hammer. Highly recommend product for these uses
3,ok,"quick and easy, ok price, this was a gift and haven't been used yet. but they appear to be what they claim."
5,nice clamp for most things.,"quality is good and a gives a simple/clean looking way to hold down things in the jeep. only is 1"" to 2.5"" but that's good for a shovel to hilift"
4,"Hold tight and work well, get lots of these!","Heavy duty rubber gripper holders for use on boats, cars and buildings. These are only rated down as they ""corrode"" like rubber over time and do not come with any mounting hardware. Very thick rubber and have some adjustment for different sized objects. Get these in this size for axes, garden implements, gaffers hook on boats, oars, etc. Larger ones work well for fire extinguishers and farmers jacks. These should be sold in a 20 pack or by the dozen. Very nice to use."
4,Stay Beautiful,"Definatley the best book on the manics available. Simon Price has an huge knowledge of the band, and as well as a general (and highly entertaining) biography this book also has a number of ""essays"" on things such as the manics and weslh nationalism, the manics and america and many others. A great read for anyone interested in what i (and many many others) consider to be the most important band of the 90's. My only problem is that Price' personal views on a number of things are a bid evident, but hell he spent the time writing the book so he can do that if he wants."
1,Not worth it,"When I received this safe, first I was surprised how small it really was- even though I knew by the description it was going to be small. I opened the box and took out the shiny red steel safe and looked for the key to open it or the 'combination'. The keys were inside the locked safe and there were no written instructions on how to open it or a 'combination' anywhere. Since I was rushed to wrap it, I e-mailed customer service for the company to find out how to open it so that I would know when my son unwrapped this gift. Customer service e-mailed back promptly and told me to set the combination to 20 and turn the key-which was still locked INSIDE the safe. The metal slide knob to open it did not work and so I ended up forcing it open to get the keys out. When I did, it still did not work with the keys, combination or anything other than force. It is cheap and I am probably not going to give it to my son because it is frustrating to try to pry open and not worth the effort."
2,Lock Issue,This Cash Box has a major lock problem.The key lock does not even lock just the code lock and is easy to break into. NO directions which is stupid.Looks nice but does not hold many storage items.Don't waste your money!!
3,"poor quality, but good value","I've had a cash box like this for over 20 years. They have cheapened it up a bit, but kids will still love it. The key didn't even fit in the key hole because of a misalignment, but I was able to bend it so it kind of fits."
3,it's okay,"These are ok for small children.. I purchased 2, one for each of my children 4 and 6 years old. The key doesn't work in either of them so it was a little bit of a bummer but they are little so they got over it."
1,Key doesn't work,"This was a big disapointment on my sons sixth birthday. He loves keys and locks so much that we bought him this. The toy is worthless because the key doesn't work. The combination opens on 5 but they don't have a visible number on the lock so you can see the number. So my six year old has a hard time with the tiny hash marks that he has to count. He hasn't played with it, just begged me to fix the key. Don't buy this."
3,it is not a real cash box,I gave it to my kid and he used it as a real cash box and it was all stolen and it was so easy to open
2,Locking box?,"Cute, but doesn't stay locked. Using both combination lock and key lock, box can be opened with ease. Will not recommend if looking for secure locking box."
2,Regret buying it,"This item is just too flimsy. Hinges and lock are under par. Bought it for a 5 year old child, but ended up buying a sturdier version from another source."
4,Lock Box,Product came in good condition with fast shipping. Good lock box for child.Just the right size to fit in childs room easy.
1,Disappointing,"Bought two for Christmas. One arrived with a broken handle. One arrived with the ""cash box"" sign on the front falling off. Neither works particularly well, as the lock sticks and we often have trouble helping our kids open them. The kids are not able to open them without help. Wish I had inspected them before Christmas Eve---they would have gone back."
3,OK,needed a bank my kids cant easily get into to rob themselves. These are sturdy enough. The locks seem cheap but working OK for the last month.
3,Battery Tender Jr = Poor Product,"Product arrived on-time from amazon. Purchased this for an old motorcycle that I was tired of swapping chargers with. I opted to give this one a try because of all the positive reviews. This charger is just a poorly made product. Even though is was $20, and less than other brands I have purchased, I think it is a waste of money. First, it says it is for agm batteries, but only charges a battery at 14.3v. Agm's need a higher voltage than this (in fact all batteries need a higher voltage than this). Second, it would not bring my battery up to a full charge. Lastly, the charger runs really hot, so I was afraid to leave this connected for a long period of time. Frustrated, I decided to open up the charger, and to my surprise, all there is is a transformer and a diode. For a transformer in a box, I should have paid a lot less."
5,Battery Tender,My husband is very happy with this item. He put it on our riding mower so that we don't have to jump it off every time we want to use it. It is working exactly as advertised and was delivery exactly as stated.
5,Worked well for me,"After doing a fair amount of research online and locally, I purchased the Battery Tender Junior a couple of months ago to charge and maintain the battery in my mother's 1999 Nissan Maxima. The vehicle is almost never driven, and any driving always had to be preceded by about 18 hours' charge on a very old charger that had no ""maintain"" functionality. The Battery Tender has performed very well in the time I've had it. The initial charge took about four days and the charge level seems to have been consistently maintained ever since.The auto is rarely driven so I use the Battery Tender in a very basic implementation with cables attached directly to the battery terminals. I didn't try the included ""ring"" adapters nor purchase any of the convenience accessories (e.g., the cigarette lighter adapter). I would definitely consider them if the vehicle was taken out frequently."
2,You get what you pay for...,"But with that said, I expected this seemingly simple gadget to perform as intended, at least for a while. I used it to charge/tend a 1 yr old 12v battery and it seemed okay: the red light lit up per the instructions, the wall wart adapter became warm, and I could hear the fluid in the battery bubbling (boiling?). The problem is that it never stopped going full bore and never went into trickle charge mode, and the green light never came on.After reading other reviews about the Tender Jr. prematurely cooking batteries I didn't want to take my chances and purchased a competitor's product. It gave me a good laugh though, b/c whomever stuck the ""Q.C.Pass"" sticker on the unit was either incompetent or simply didn't give a rip if it functioned or not. Thus, I can't recommend this product."
5,MotorCycle Battery Charger,"I ordered this MotorCycle Battery charger, came in on time was a complete package with all parts, works great ordered one for my daughter's bike also.Great product would order again."
4,Keeps my scooter battery ready,"A must have device if you own a motorcycle or scooter, especially if you plan to keep it in the garage during the rainy or cold season. The battery stays fully charged and ready to start my scooter. Great"
4,good product,"This is a good battery maintance product for a moderate price. I have 5 which I use to maintain batterys in two boats. lawn mower, gasoling golf cart and motorcycle. I also have one of the more expensive Battery Tender Models and these appear to work just as good, just without all the bells and whistles on the more expensive one."
5,It's like the sliced bread of battery tenders,"Easy to use, great price, and works like a charm. Great if you don't want to splurge on a new battery, and just need a little extra charge. Fully charges my motorcycle battery in a few hours."
3,"Does what it says, just takes nearly a day.","It charges at .75 amps/hour so to charge a fully drained 12V battery takes like 16 hours. It's small and compact, but I'd rather a bigger one that charges faster."
5,Great item,"It came with aligator clips and lines for permanent attachment to battery. Both had quick disconnects to the unit. Great price on this, especially since it came with both connection types."
5,A must item for your car,"this is an excellent item , i installed in 3 of my cars , in matter fact one had a dead battery an it was recharged.Thanks"
5,Top notch product,I purchased two of these units and they are the best. Plug them up and let them do there job it's as simple as that. I would highly recommend these to someone that wants to keep a battery charged.
2,Battery tender Junior 12V,"It's amazing that this item has got so many 5-star votes. Clearly it's using really old technology and wasting so much electric power to give out merely 750mA. Mine gets so hot it feels like a small iron set at low output that stays on all the time. I hooked it to my 90% full battery and 4 days later the LED light still shows red. I returned it for one with switching power, this type of wall-wart is just not good for your electric bill. Save the environment, stay away from it."
3,Watch out for overcharge,"This battery tender has worked largely as advertised, but I had problems with overcharging on two different batteries, and two different units. While tending the battery over the winter, both batteries popped the vent caps explosively, sending acid everywhere. Perhaps the batteries (less than 4 months old) where over-full, as I have not had trouble since then (same batteries)."
5,Piece of mind,"This is one of the best purchases I have made for my bike. Since adding several electronic accessories the Battery Tender Jr has kept my motorcycle starting with ease every time. As always, the customer service with Amazon was fantastic!"
3,Clarifying - No GEL,"The description on this charger is misleading. It will not charge GEL batteries. While they state that all of their products will, that is incorrect. They make a charger that specifically is designed for charging GEL batteries. Don't be fooled. I've had this on a GEL battery for weeks and it won't charge. It maintained the battery over the winter fine, but will not charge it from dead.Description is misleading. I wouldn't have bought this charger had I known this. I would have spent the money on the one that is specifically designed for GEL batteries."
5,Necessary Item,"A necessary item to consider for all your garaged items such as motorcycles, riding mowers, and even cars that do not get a lot of running time or are stored for the winter months."
5,Works great.,Purchased to keep battery charged on my John Deere utility tractor during the winter and it works great. I would buy it again.
5,Battery Tender - Connect and forget!,I love this product. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. No overcharging. Keeps batteries at the optimum charge level. Extends the life of your battery by preventing sulfation and deep drain cycles. I have four bikes and I keep all batteries on the battery tender all winter long. Connect and forget!
4,Worth the money,"I recommend this item for anyone wanting to keep their battery in good shape, during the winter or for extended periods of storage. I bought this unit as a back up for my riding lawn mower, very good product at fair price. It came with adapters necessary to hook up easy, and can be used on many appliances."
4,Simple inexpensive and really does work to keep a charge,I have used this battery tender jr for my Harley for a couple of years and just now bought one for my snowmobile and boat. In the spring my Harley starts right up with a full charge and the battery itself has lasted 3 years so far with is awesome compared to previous batteries. I now have my boat battery charging all winter with this product. It took about 6 hours to gain a full charge and now sits full.People wonder if the Jr can be used with car/truck/boat batteries and I now from experience have to say yes. It just takes a little longer to charge fully. But once full will keep it charged no problem. NOTE: if you have a vehicle in storage that is charging with this product and it has some sort of constant battery drain that exceeds .75mA (radio/fan/lights left on) then you will need the larger (non-Jr) unit.
5,Great for keeping a battery charged,I keep the battery charged in my Buick Grand National with a Battery Tender Junior. Takes up very little space and does the job well.
5,Can't have too many!,"This battery tender Jr. is great for anything you want to store or have ready for cold winter.The technology is state of the art.I have one Battery tender ""senior'which has twice the power to charge my stuff fast,and three Jr's to keep a motorcycle,Gel battery Miata,and emergency generator in check.The jr's have half the ""juice"",but unless you want a faster charge(8hrs vs. 16 hrs on a dead battery,you can do just fine with the Jr's.A couple things to note.The Jr's come with aligator clips and ring clips,the Senior only comes with ring clips,so make sure you add the alligator clips with your order.Keep in mind every battery is in a different state of service,depending on age etc., so make sure you check the battery after about 6hrs the first time you use the tenders.If the battery is warm,you probably want to keep close watch on your charging,its probably the battery.Packaging and delivery are as good as can be(Amazon direct).Get one soon ,or two or three!"
4,It's a battery tender,The battery tender arrived as expected. I would recommend this one to others. Only drawback: it took the post office an extra day to deliver (I'll survive).
5,Works!,"Keeps my battery charged and easy to hook up. Just connect either the alligator clips or the ring terminals and plug the unit into the wall and you're done! This unit is very simple a single LED tells you the status of the charge/battery. For the price can't go wrong and it's nice to know that when you go to start up whatever it is, you can count on it."
5,excellent charger,I purchased this charger for my toad or tow car behind motorhome need to charge battery every night when stopped to keep battery at full charge to run brake even by roadmaster it works great with out over charging battery also have one for my motorbike battery it really saves the battery and and keeps it full charged.
5,works great,"I have a 700 king quad in which they are known for draining the battery. with this tender i have not had a issue starting it yetits been almost a month now, and I have no worries going out and staring it right up."
4,Works fine and does the job,Put all the attachments to my battery on my Ducati monster and left it on for our 3 weeks vacation. Did the job fine and the adapter is easy to connect to for future use.
5,Great product,We have bought 3 of these for our cars and generator. I was so impressed I just gave a set to a relative who loves cars. It keeps a battery fully charged and avoids battery drain during long storage periods. It also promotes longer battery life. It includes a connector with eyelets which allows one to permanently secure the connector to the battery and extends to the edge of the hood. That way you can connect without raising the hood. My mechanic recommended it and uses it himself. First rate.
5,Great motorcycle battery tender,This is an easy to install and use battery tender. If you store your motorcycle during the winter you should use one of these to extend the life of your battery.
5,Good product,This item works as advertised. I have it hooked up to my motorcycle and it starts every time after storing my bike during the winter...
4,Good solid product,"This is your basic maintenance battery charger and is well worth the money. I would buy this one again, with out hesitation."
4,a must have for the ATV or JetSki owner..,"If you dont have a trickel charger for your PWC or ATV at some point you'll wish you did,Takes all the wonder if my battery is up to a full charge for the day. A green light tells the user the peak performance is met and ready for service. A relief when you must consider all the necessary things to do and include in a sucessful outting.Plug it in each time your done using the battery and you'll be fully charged ready for the next trip ,Cheap insureance, I would be happy to recommend."
5,Juice Up!!,Keeps my Mustang battery fresh for those spring cruises!!Works great!!! My lawn mower battery wants to marry it!I don't even leave it on all the time! One week everytwo or three weeks!
4,Best price on the Internet,"Checked all over, local auto parts, Super Store, etc. the best price for this little charger on the Internet is Amazon! These little chargers are great, we have them on all of our farm equipment, anytime of year we need to start up one of our tractors, we know the battery will be fully charged."
4,Works as described,This charger seemed to work fine. I attached it to a new lead-acid battery and the lights indicated the battery charged normally.
4,Quick and accurate shipping,Using the battery tender now and it seems to be working properly after several weeks now. Great product as described!
5,Great Charger,"This is a very nice little charger. It comes complete with all the necessary cables which are a good length (12 ft). I bought it to charge a new AGM sealed motorcycle battery. These batteries require that the charge rate not exceed 2 amps, so the 750 ma from this charger works great. The charger is fully automatic and completed the initial charge without a hitch. The package also contains a set of cables that can be permanently attached to the battery so that the seat does not have to be removed for future charging. Very handy for motocycles, ATVs etc."
5,Perfect,"This thing does exactly what it should, and for the price you can't beat it.For just one bike, there's no need for higher-end products (IMO). This charger is terrific."
5,Excellent product.,This is an excellent product that works very well. I have three of these and they are a must for extending battery life. Works great for all lead acid batteries for things that are not used very often.
5,"Great product, great investment","For me, this is one of those products that just keeps on giving. Have been using a number of these for different vehicles for several years. The longest is about 8 years. I drive this particular vehicle about once a year, if that. After getting tired of replacing the battery every two years I decided to buy the Battery Tender. The battery in this vehicle is now over 8 years old and still starts the car like new. Love it."
4,Does what it's meant for,"I got this based on review. It does what it's meant to and does it well. Arrived promptly. My only complaint is that the cord wasn't as long as I needed it to be, but it's probably adequate for most jobs. Would buy again. Very satisfied."
5,Wow! Simple solution,"Was having problems with my generator's battery not recharging. Got tired of hauling out my battery charger, unlocking the cabinet, and then cleaning up after the battery recharged. Plugged this in to an outlet in the garage, ran the cable to the generator and have not had to mess with the battery since. Will check the battery in a few months, but so far I am extremely satisfied with this battery tender."
5,Great product,This tender works great. I have one on every battery in my garage. They are always ready to go. I would recommend this product.
5,battery was fully charged,i bought this unit because I had to keep buying new batteries for vehiclesand lawn equipment left in a hot florida garage unattended all summer.now I remove the batteries and place them in the house on battery tenders.when I return in the fall they are fully charged and work fine
5,Perfect,I took this apart and setup a relay so that when the AC was disconnected it would disconnect the battery. I utilized this inside a pelican case as a self contained charging unit.
4,Handy charger,It comes with all the cables you need and the lenght of the cables are just right. The price was better than other places. It does the job its design to do.
1,Arrived defective,"Not a durable product and, from other reviewers, it appears that the manufacture/distributor is quite flaky and difficult to work with.Just another ""made in China"" product. Cheaply made. No fuse on the charging unit itself. No voltage protection. As long as it works, and while it does get unusually hot even when it is not charging, you might be okay with the Battery Tender. Just keep it away from anything flamable.Batteries are far more complicated than most people give them credit for. You can buy a new battery and have immediate problems with it. A battery may last for many, many years or may fail within a short period of time.Often, it is difficult to trace an electrical problem back to a bad battery. Accordingly, it would be unfair to criticize the Battery Tender for damaging a battery but, the bigger issue appears to be the durability of the Battery Tender itself."
4,Works well,"So far so good, note the round ringlets may need to be filed to fit your connection and some bikes can't use them, so check. The traditional hook ups work fine as an alternative though."
4,Good product,"All BT products are tough and dependable. I have most of their product line, and they set the standard for other look alikes."
5,battery tender junior,"If you ride every day or once a month you need this product. It will save you from having to call a tow truck, cold cranking problems in the morning and buying a battery every time you ride after a long winter."
4,"Charges battery, hadn't exploded ... yet!","I use the battery tender to keep my motorcycle battery charged during the winter using the included clips. I've heard that they have reliability issues but I've have had no problems so far. It does what it is supposed to do, not much more to say!"
4,Battery Tender,"This is good little product that does what it is intended to do. The price is a bit steep for the actual components, and it is a profit maker for the Manufacturer. But, it does the Job!!!!"
5,Best Buy for Super Product,"Needed something to guarantee quick starts in single digit weather. This charger did the trick and started the car every time like a new battery. The multi color LED is really nice since it tells you the condition of the battery at all times, and it will indicated if your battery can't take or maintain a charge."
5,Riding again,It works! I live in Denver CO and don't get out often in the winter to charge the battery. I installed it on a near dead battery and a few days later when it warmed up I was riding. Great product and easy to use.A+
4,Good product,"I have a pickup truck, new, that will be sitting in a garage for 4 months or more while I am on a trip. The newer vehicles have a lot of electronics that do not like having power interruptions so I really didn't want to disconnect the battery like I have done with older vehicles. The battery tender fills my needs perfectly."
5,Terrific for battery maintenance!!! Highly Recommended,"The Deltran 12V Battery Tender is a terrific product. I agree whole heartedly with the other ""5 Star"" reviews. Comes with very long cables and the pieces and parts you'll typically nead. Very complete. Perfect for maintaining a battery, for instance, in colder months for a car that isn't driven much. Price from Amazon is the best I could find around. Very pleased with the purchases. Highly recommended."
5,Love My Battery Tender,"I have been using another ""Battery Tender "" product for a couple of years now. So when need arose for an additional charger I choose ""Battery Tender"" again. So simple, just connect & forget about it."
5,Good product,Happy so far with this product easy to use with light indicators. Using it for my Harley that I only ride in the summer times. Other then that it is stored in a garage with the battery tender. Only had it for a few months.
5,Dead batteries no more,"I first purchased this item about a year ago for my garage queen so that I wouldn't have to keep dealing with dead batteries. It worked so well that my father repo'ed it for his own car and bought me a replacement. There isn't much to say about it other than it works. The wall wart gets a bit warm, but no more than another one of similar size. I keep it permanently connected to the battery in my Mustang and occasionally use it to 'top off' the battery in my girlfriend's car. My only complaint is that I didn't buy one sooner - I could have saved myself buying two new batteries."
5,Excellent Unit,"I got 2 of these for my 2 motorcycles and 2 quads. They work well, and perform as advertised - keeping the battery charged without without over charging. It's great and inexpensive peace of mind."
5,Multi-purpose charger,"Have used this on a motorcycle and a generator and it works flawlessly. A must have, especially in cold climates where a charged battery is paramount"
5,Works great for my portable generator maintenance free battery,Fits my needs perfectly and inexpensive as well. It's great that this product has a long cord and optional connectors. I highly recommend it.
2,did not last,This battery tender worked like it was supposed to for about14 months then diedNot worth the price for such a short time product. Would not recommend this productpresently using a similar product from harbor freight which cost 80% less and worksgreat
5,Saved my battery,This the winter as cold as it has been this year I figured it was finally time to purchase one of these for my motorcycle. Previously I would go and run the bike for a while every week but by the end of winter I would have an almost dead battery. With this Battery Tender Jr. I was able to not run the bike for over 1 month and she turned right on when I went to try it out. A must have for any motorcycle owner!
5,love it,"works great for my motorcycle , it fits under the seat while charging when i have it parked outside and no one can take it , i use it for a 2011 hayabusa"
4,Battery Tender Jr.,Ordered two Battery Tender Jr units instead of one of the Battery Tender Plus units as it allows me to top off batteries on two separate vehicles at once for about the same money. Was a little concerned about the limited output capability of these Jr. units but so far they have performed very well with the battery voltages indicating full charges when the units display a green LED.
2,Fried my battery,"Had the Battery Junior hooked to my KLR650 for 8 mos storage over the winter in garage. Went to start -- nothing. Checked the battery and to my great dismay, it was totally dry. The Tender had completely baked all the cells dry. It's NOT supposed to do that. The battery was terminated with ensuing great cost for replacement. Called Battery Tender and they said since the charger is more than a year old, nothing we can do. ""We sorry""."
1,Lost a long time customer,"This product didn't last more than 2 hours. I have been using Deltran battery chargers for my car and motorcycle for years. Last summer I purchased a replacement unit for my motorcycle. I got 3 defective units in a row, never lasting more than a month. I switched to a competitor brand 7 months ago with no problems since. My girlfriend had the same problem with Deltran chargers on her bike. I thought it was a bad production batch. I purchased this unit for my car. The old unit lasted about 3 years. This unit lasted about 2 hours. I emailed Deltran and received a form letter stating they save cost by producing the unit in China. I returned the unit and went to Autozone, purchased a another brand with no problems."
1,Warranty Deception,If you send Deltron your faulty Battery Tender Junior along with about half of what you paid for it they will call and tell you how much it will cost you to have them fix it. I didn't believe it either. I went to their website for more information as the Warranty suggested and could find nothing. I will fix it myself; with a hammer.
5,Great Product,Tender works great for my motorcycle battery. I espeically like that it has a light on it that provides some visual feedback.
5,"Deltran Battery Tender, Junior","This product works exactly as expected. I have it attached to my 2006 GTO that is in storage. Last year I had to replace the battery after 3 short years and 5,000 miles because I did not use a battery tender. It is maintaining the battery as designed. I expect this inexpensive unit to extend the life of my expensive battery. No more stranding and seeking someone to jump my dead battery!Deltran Battery Tender Junior 12-Volt 750 mA Battery Charger"
5,battery tender jr,Excellent devices. I live in cold country and need to monitor and maintain battery strength and life over down months. Use on tractor atv and motorhome.
5,A great 3-stage charger.,"I am using this permanently connected (float service) for an alarm system using a 12V gel-cell battery. It is a great bargain for the technology it contains, which prevents over-charging that would be common with a less sophisticated unit."
5,A Must Have Item,The Battery Tender takes out the worry of a fully charged battery. Just hook it up and leave. It keeps the battery fully charged while not over-charging in the mean time. I keep it hooked to my camper battery so I'm always ready to go with a full charge. The indicator lights let you know the status of the charge so there is no guessing. The compact size makes it easy to keep out of the weather.
5,Great,Great! If you have a new car and it is parked you must have this. You just plug in and let it go. It automatically does it's thing. No over charge.
4,Satisfied.,"I ordered the battery tender hoping to have it mounted on my van. I hadn't read the specifications while placing the order and realized it was not portable only after I received the shipment. Anyhow, I now have it plugged in my garage and use it as a battery charger for the lawn tractor. I am more than satisfied with the efficiency it works."
5,Battery Tender,Great product for motorcycle batteries. Comes with cable to attach to battery so there is no need to remove battery cover. Keeps my battery charged all winter with no overcharging.
2,Not very good for using 220v Outlet and with 220/110 Transformer,"If you are going to use it outside of USA for a 220v (50Hz) outlet and with a 220v/110v transformer, this charger may be not quite good for you. I have purchased two and they all stop to work completely after only 2 times of use. I think that there is some kind of protection circuit that ""cuts-off"" connection but with no way to know how to get it back.I also purchased another Deltran battery charger:Deltran Battery Tender 12-Volt 800 milliamp Waterproof Battery Chargerand this one is very good and doesn't need transformer because its input is 100-240 and only about $10 more expensive."
1,Awful Battery Tender,"My husband hates this battery charger, it doesn't work as good as the big chargers, he said it was a waste of money"
1,Very Disappointed,"4/14/2009 10:14 AM.Can't give a real good report when I never received the product. The service is not any good, because I didn't get any service nor I didn't get what I ordered either, so I can't say anything good about this company.So ~ one thing I do know is you can't count on this company that I ordered from when they don't ship one's order.But they didn't have any problem taking my money. That they seemed to do quit easily with no problem at all.I hope I don't have to order anything from them ever in the future.Signed by I'm Pooped ~~ DR of Las Vegas, NV."
1,buy local it will save time and aggrevation,"sent item back wrong item sent, it is 1 month later and still no charger"
1,Battery charger,"The batterie I purchased the charger for, is very low, but the chargerwon't turn on to charge the batterie.The light on the charger is blinking red."
5,Good,These things are great. I bought several of them as I have several vehicles that don't get driven a lot. They work.
5,Excellent Smart Charger,"I own three of these to keep various batteries in top shape. I chose this charger because it won't harm modern AGM and gell cell batteries. It is well made and convenient. I have harnesses wired into a motorcycle, a boat, a trailer, and a communication center so connection is as easy as plugging it in. The only down side of this product is that it won't charge a completely depleted battery. If the battery is below 3 volts it won't charge it. But, with this product around, I never have to worry about any battery getting that low."
5,Battery Tender Jr Saves the Day!,"I recently started working from home and especially in the winter months, my Acura TL spends a lot of time just parked in the garage. After several weeks of not driving, the 1 year old battery died. I purchased the Jr version of the Battery Tender and problem solved. My car now remains plugged in and ready for action after long spells in the garage. The price was right and it maintains a charge perfectly. Simple to use. When I need to use the car, it takes 15 seconds to open the hood, remove the aligator clamps and close the hood and go. No need any longer to make sure it goes out for a ""battery charging drive"" in poor weather, wasting both time and gas."
5,Battery maintainer,Running for 4 months-so far so good. Have to wait 2-3 years for final review based on experience with other brands.
4,These are nice,"I use them to keep the batteries topped off on three vehicles, none of which I use more than a couple times a month. They're easy to install and work great."
5,Useful & easy,Does what it should; just set it and forget it until you need the battery again. It's worth the price.
4,Best battery charger,This is the best product on the market for what it does.Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is its a little pricey.
5,Battery Tender Junior,"Great product - keeps my motorcycle battery warm, juiced, and ready to go during the cold winter months."
3,battery tender jr.,No way to mount under hood. Have to either take it out/off or build a bracket to install permenant. Other than that it does the job intended.
5,Works just like it states. I'm very happy with this product.,I have been using it for about a month and it works great. I would recommend this product to who ever has a motorcycle battery they want to keep charged during the winter.
5,Battery Tenders for Christmas,"I'm so completely satisfied with this product I'm going to by more for as Chistmas presents for other members of my family! You won't be disappointed if you purchase this unit through Amazon, they delivered mine well within the time frame. I better order now, if more people use online shopping to get their presents!"
5,Saved me from having to buy a new battery,I absentedmindly left my keys in my motorcycle and the battery ran down. I bought the battery tender jr. approximately 6 months ago and never used it. I painstakenly pushed the bike home hooked up the battery tender and left it for 12 hours. The next morning my bike cranked up. I highly reccommend this product.
1,Disappointing,Bought this charger to charge a security system 12 volt rechargeable battery. I charged it for 12 hours and it did not charge the battery. I tried another 12 v battery and got the same results. I sent it back for a refund.
1,Poor Product,This product is the worst on the market. It will fail when you least expect it and within a month of purchase. Buy a Yuasa.
5,Works as advertised.,"Great product - no more dead motorcycle battery. Simple to install, simple to use. Wish I had bought this long ago!"
5,WORKS AS ADVERTISED,"I bought 3 of them. We have an RV and two collector cars. It's nice to know that you can go out any time and find the battery fully charged. More extended life for the battery too, because it is not going through repeated charging cycles which reduce the life of the battery."
5,Battery Tender Junior,"Product was exactly as described, and shipping to CA was very speedy. Quite satisfied with purchase."
4,Would buy more if needed,"Great product works as it should. Save $$$ on batteries going bad. I have six of these and have not needed to replace a battery on my boat, rv or riding lawn mower in three years"
4,easy to use,wanted another charger for batteries. Wanted something simple for my bike and heard the tenders were good. I have others I like better for my mowers and stuff and this was cheaper than my other charger/maintainer. does what it suppose to do and would recommend. know several people that like these tenders also.
5,little life saver,i bought two chargers for my motorcycles. it keeps your personal toys fully charged without overcharging. the price is right and so far it's been a great device. i highly recomend this to anyone that has a pleasure ride or vessel that only uses from time to time. AAA+++.
5,battery tender,"This an easy one.Simply put it is great.I have replaced my deep cycle batteries more than once because I didn't take proper care of them. NO more.When I put my RV away for the winter I take out my batteries and put them on the ""Battery Tender"" and no more buying new ones every year I bought two of them and they work great."
5,Great product,"What can I say? They do what they are supposed to do, and act like Battery Tenders have always acted like. I dont have to waste money anymore on buying new batteries for my trolling motor every year, or flooding my motorcycle every spring because the battery doesn't have enough juice. The light works perfectly, the product itself feels very strong and built to last."
5,Exactly as expected,"installation accomplished quickly, item works like a champ. Would recommend to anyone with a motorcycle, ATV or riding lawnmower to keep that battery charged"
5,Best battery tender,Not using this winter since I moved to Florida but a valuable addition to your maintenance needs for you northerners.
5,Great deal! Fine product.,"I basically got two of these items through Amazon for slightly more than what one costs in local stores. I have 2 BMW's and a Ducati. I already had one charger. Now, especially in winter, I can climb on and crank up without any worry about having a hot battery. And they significantly increase battery life. What's not to like? Great product!"
5,Great charger!,Purchased this to top off a motorcycle battery on a BMW G650GS. It does a great job keeping it charged up.
5,Plug and play,I purchased this battery tender to charge my weekend car so the battery stays fresh. So far it works as advertised and super easy to use.
5,Works great!,"Bought this from my motorcycle when I was planning on being out of town for a couple weeks. What was thought to be acouple weeks, turned out to be over a month.When I got back, I disconnected the charger and my bike fired right up. Wow! it does what its supposed to do. Very happy! Easy to hook up and disconnect.Also used to keep my car batteries charged. Great product!"
3,too slow to charge.,Takes quite a while to charge my motorcycle battery when it is low. About 2 to 3 days. Will recommend the model that charges faster. Otherwise it does work.
1,Didn't last more than 1.5 years!,Bought this item back in 2010 and it worked fine until a couple of week ago. The green light just flashes quickly and doesn't charge. To send the charger back to Deltran and paying for the warranty cost just as much as a new one. I would suggest getting the Battery Tender plus or other maintainers.
1,Didn't last,"I bought one of these and while it seemed to work fine for several months, it didn't last a year before it died. Not sure what happened but it wouldn't charge. I have had good luck with the Yuasa brand chargers and prefer them now exclusively."
5,Space Prison,"Great story from my childhood - I've been looking for this for over 30 years! After reading it again, it is still a great story!"
4,Great little alarm or Chime,I have used alarms like this to let me know if doors are opened. I have a small Elerly care business. They work well and are easy to use even for my staff. Highly recommend!
1,Bell and Howell Alarm System - DON'T BUY!!!,"I purchased this as an alarm for my front door. The ""chime"" is as loud as the alarm, so anytime you open the door, the entry chime blasts in your ear and wakes the neighbors. It's an annoying product you should AVOID!"
3,okay,"It's one of the okay looking models I have in my collection, but still I could'nt be more happier about having it here."
4,"Beyond ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight""","I must wholeheartedly agree with the previous review and say that this is a very good collection of classic white DooWop. ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" is played ad nauseum on oldies stations and that one I could have done without. But I'd not heard several of the other tunes previously and there are some hidden gems here, especially ""Please Write"". The covers of ""A Thousand Miles Away"" and ""Sincerely"" will certainly not make anyone forget about the Heartbeats and Moonglows but they are decent offerings. Personally I thought ""My Friend's Car"" was a nice break in the action for the the group and while nothing to get too excited about, was entertaining. All in all, a very good buy."
3,Family secrets...,"DARKNESS, I is the third in a series of books revolving around the family of Scarabae: powerful, ancient and occasionally vampirish. In this story, Rachaela's second daughter, Anna, is kidnapped by one of it's earliest progenitors, Cain. It mixes gothic horror with both Egyptian and Biblical mythology.I found it a letdown from the first two installments (DARK DANCE and PERSONAL DARKNESS), which I loved. This volume is painfully slow, and nothing much happens. I hate to admit it but I found much of it actually boring. I do recommend the previous novels, however...and it seems that another one is possible."
2,"Product worked as advertised, but careful...","I followed the instructions and within days, the grass grew exactly as pictured on the product page. I have 3 cats and the first cat didn't like it, the second cat did like it, and the third cat loved it. The problem was that the two cats that ate it would throw up shortly after eating it leaving a mess.I tried to limit the amount they'd eat, so their bodies could get used to it, but they never did adapt. I ended up throwing it out because it just wasn't agreeing with their bodies.I would be cautious with this simply because it made my cats sick."
2,Kitty Cat Grass,The grass did not grow but since I am not much of a gardner I may not have had the right gardening skills to make it grow. I would not buy again.
2,You need to water!,It says you only need to water it once. My grass was dead in a week. It also did not come in the circle pot. It comes in a cheap square plastic container.Won't buy again- a waste of money.
4,This product is good but dies after a couple of months.,This product is great. My cat loves it and asks for it to be put on the floor for him to eat on all the time. He is a long hair and it stopped his hairballs. The only problem I had with it was that it died after four months.
3,Great for a about a week,"I keep it away from my cat and cut the grass and give it to him, so that he doesn't pull at the grass in the container and the seeds; makes no difference, after a few days the grass turns brown from the root and it's gone. But my cat loves it for the few days I can give him the grass. I would like it a lot better if it wasn't so expensive, for just a weeks worth of grass. BTW, the container on the bottom is just a plastic, dish like and very light weight. If you let the cat chew the grass off the container goes everywhere and the whole thing falls apart easily."
3,Good Grass but product should be better described,"Cat likes the grass, easy to grow. The description of the product however leads one to believe the product is larger than it actually is."
3,My cat could care less,The directions were easy to follow and the grass grew well but my cat could care less about it. He's sniffed it a couple of times and that's it. I was hoping it would be a good diversion for him from our house plants that he likes to nibble on but it didn't work out. It may be great for some cats but it's not for mine.
2,"its pretty but,","this stuff grows great. i even planted it outside where my cat normally likes to eat grass, but he is totally not interested in this stuff."
4,Not Maurice Ravel of 1875-1937,"Though this music is good, this is not the Classical Impressionist composer Maurice Ravel. A very good album either way, but would like to see his name separated from the French composer."
1,Robotic printing product unsatisfactory,"As best as I can determine this book was produced for me on demand. An old, perhaps out of print, edition was scanned. It was then type-set by a ""robotic device."" The result was a book filled with page after page of ""typos."" For the first few pages figuring out what the original words were was an intriguing challenge. After that it all became an irritating nightmare. In the end I sought out a normal edition from another source. Oh, well, but never again if I can help it."
5,Great Book,"Another great book by Lewis Sperry Chafer. It teaches some of the ""false forces"" used in evangelism today and how to avoid them.Salvation is by faith alone and Chafer does a great job showing that.This is a must read for any evangelist. The Gospel is simple so let's keep it simple so that souls can get saved!"
5,buy the other copy,"this copy has many typos, the next kindle copy of this excellent book is typo free."
4,An accurate romanticization of the Texas Rangers,"W.P. Webb's history of the Texas Rangers is an excellent example of the 1935 society in which it was written. It is not a ""complete"" history of the Rangers (through '35), but the facts that he includes are mostly sound. The format is a bit encyclopedic, but Mr. Webb's narration is always beautiful.The interesting aspect of the book is the facts that Mr. Webb leaves out. While the racist aspects of the Rangers' exploits, expecially during the Mexican War, were well known to contemporary historians, Mr. Webb does not include this part of Ranger history in his volume. Even so, the book is an enlightening read to anyone who can keep in mind that it is not the whole truth."
3,not good enough,"I used this book for French 201 and 202. I like how each chapter focuses on one culture of the Francophone world, but the explanations of grammar and the exercises are bad. I'm a French tutor, and I had to make up my own exercises for a student because the exercises in the book are unclear and don't make any sense.Brandon Simpson"
5,Gettin' Down Fishing,"A great book on trolling, with lots of information about downriggers. The author also covers the importance of boat speed, temperature, sonar, and more. You can learn much from the author on catching a wide range of species including striped bass, black bass, muskie, walleye, salmon, and trout. If you troll, or would like to learn about it, get this book.Another excellent book on trolling is ""Trolling Top to Bottom."" These two books form an excellent foundation for anyone wanting to catch fish using this enjoyable and productive method. Once you get into trolling, you will also want a copy of ""Precision Trolling,"" an encyclopedia of crankbaits that tells you how deep each bait will go given the length of line out. Tight lines!"
3,Standard,"These do exactly what they were supposed to, but I do wish that they were easier to handle somehow. That is a problem I expect real scientists to still have though.I like having the plastic casing for them, but it is hard to put them back. Lastly, they did not tell me how to clean them or what to do after I use one. Those things would have been good information to know."
3,Hard to open item,The cover slips are adequate but the clear adhesive tape closure on the plastic case makes opening and accessing the cover slips is very difficult. Several spilled when I finally opened the case. Very poor packaging.
5,Insightful work,"This book addresses many significant problems in the world today (2003-to present) from the vantage point of the capitalist critic. It preaches localization of centralized governments in third world countries as alternatives to the dominating presence of the WTO and ICC. Although these organizations allow impoverished countries to create jobs, in many instances the respective jobs come at the expense of the entire communities' well-being (water privatization). The text ties pollution problems to the need to maintain the economic machine. If you see anything on your TV news source (CNN, FOX News) about WTO protests in large cities, and seem troubled, then read this book. It will explain why the people marching on your TV screen are so angry."
4,wonderful chick flick,For some reason I have an obsession with romance but this movie was great. The chemistry between both leading actor(s) was great. when I am down I tend to watch it.
3,this is about a woman named Gabrielle,"Anwar, that is, who was at her peak in this movie. That faraway look she gives while waiting in the car of that Englishman, near the end of the movie, still haunts me to this day.Otherwise, this is a remake of The Apartment starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley McLaine."
4,cute film,this is a cute film michael j. fox is pretty good in it and spoilers i am glad he picked love over that money even though it seemed as though he got everything he wanted.
5,Great romantic comedy,"This show is full of memorable scenes. My favorite is the bellhop. My wife has accused me so often of being like him that I am wondering if the writers were spying on me. ""I'll get it in one trip!"""
3,cute for the 90s,"I always thought Gabrielle Anwar was cute and having Mike Fox play the concierge of a ritzy hotel, he innocently woos a woman who deserves him btu she herself is playing around with a rich man and Mike has to juggle work and repetitive subjects to his dream of openinga new hotel in a dwindling development on the river...will he continue with the dream or drool and wish the girl will go for him?"
3,For Love or Money,"Light comedy about a Big Apple dreamer. If you're a Michael J. Fox fan, go see the movie."
5,The critics have no clue!!!,This is an amazing movie it is not populsr to the media because it deals with more than superfical subjects than sexual romance. When your heart goes the mind will follow. When Barry goes or finally becomes a legend this movie will be remembered as his sleeper thrust from the bizzare things he has done. Shall we conjure up his other wako things/ Addams Family series and now the Multi-million(almost Billion) dollar flop WILD! WILD! WEST. This is good ! His first almost real movie. Kudos Barry keep it up
4,Great Information Book for WFRP,"I was very please with SH and the background material it provided. Not having many supplements from WFB or from v1, SH provided excellent history on the provinces of the empire. Additionally it talked about the current state of the provinces after the Storm of Chaos.The one thing I was hoping to have in the book it a bit more maps, paticular of each province.For new players, this book will be a very good addition to the core rules. Longtime players of v1 and WFB will like the updates for the SoC stuff and consolodated information, but it is not a must buy."
3,Background Book,"I was a bit disappointed by the fact that the book is so thin it seems like it's 30pgs. long. Not much to it. Recently found n' RPG called Savage Wars. It's a simple core rules system that can be adapted to any AD&D, WFRPG, DH etc...setting and it's a GM's dream! IMO it beats them all because you can us it with all of them. Imagine writing a two pg. scenario that lasts for 3 hrs!!!"
3,Suburbia Series 2,I found this to be about the same level of enjoyment as Series 1. I enjoy watching it but it isn't outstanding. There are funny parts and some good plots but overall it is just okay.
3,"Not classy, but fun!","Not classy like BBC mysteries or something, but a lot of fun. Not too many chances for Americans to see regular suburban Brit neighborhoods--TV usually shows villages or the city. The mysteries are kind of slight, the fun is in the interactions of the two main characters who tend to be unlucky in love. The humor is everyday fun altho. there are some over the top characters (crazies) in most episodes. None of it is really believable, I'd be extremely worried if this were my police dept., but I found this set fun diversion when I wanted something light."
5,Better Than Anything Else Currently on TV,"I came across Murder in Suburbia while browsing in my local library because, while television at any given time is sadly lacking, it's especially barren in the summer. What a pleasant surprise! My only regret is the apparently limited run of this series. I can't remember the last time I sat back & actually watched a dvd without having to fill in the boring parts with flipping through a magazine. The characters work well together, not only the main characters, but supporting also. Writing well done also. It was wonderful to just relax and be entertained."
5,A Genealogist's Guide to Discovering Your African-American Ancestors,This is an excellant book for anybody wishing to discover their past ancestors in the 19th Century. Good case studies help to keep one focused on reality and not the negative aspects of history.
5,A Great Variety,"Both my roommate and I are avid bakers, and we are always looking for new cookie recipes. I saw this book and after flipping through it decided I needed to have it.Lauren Chattman includes recipes for classics such as chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, and slice-and-bake sugar cookies. Also included are some more interesting ideas, such as black forest chocolate chip cookies, cornmeal cranberry squares, after-dinner microwave brownies, and m&m; biscotti.The black & white cookies were a big hit with my friends, and they were surprisingly easy to make. Tonight I'm making sour cream chocolate chip cookies, and I am so excited to taste them!I really recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in baking--no skill-level necessary!"
5,My new favorite cookie book,"I got this for Christmas from a knowing mom who said that now that my children are school age I will be making more cookies. This book is well organized, has a good broad spectrum of recipes, and is easy to use. The color photos make your mouth water. So far every thing I've tried from this book has turned out GREAT!"
3,Need to add pictures!,"The recipes look good, but pictures of the cookies should be added. The author provides some great information in the front of the book. I would have kept the book if there was an index or something that showed pictures."
5,about time the game i love at the arcades is finally out,Dragon's Lair 3d is the best arcade game ever at the arcades but im glad this is for the playstation 2 and about time the object of the game is to rescue princess daphne from the cluches of that dragon but anyway its a great game
4,Finally!,"At last, Dragon's Lair can be played as it always should have been - in real-time 3D! I am glad to see this ground-breaking classic back and in good form. The look of the game is nearly the same as the original, but now you have complete control of your character. The developers have added some additional villainous creatures, but you still have the time-honored foes (Fire Drakes, Giddy Goons, Singe the Dragon). The game in its present state has 15 levels and over 250 ""chambers"" loaded with traps, puzzles, and secrets.The cel-shaded animation is smooth and looks simply awesome. The music and sound is great, and you can expect hours of gameplay. The only downside of this new Dragon's Lair is exactly that of the original - limited replay value. But it provides a wonderful bit of nostalgia for us older folks, and the younger kids should get plenty of play out of the game."
4,Nice to have background info.,"Bronwyn Carlton, The Books of Faerie (DC Comics, 1998)Having made it roughly halfway through the Sandman series, I figured it was high time to start checking out the spinoffs, The Books of Magic and The Books of Faerie. Turned out to be a good idea, on both counts.The Books of Faerie, at least this volume, comprises two tales-- that of how Titania came to be Queen of Faerie, and another regarding a quest to go find Tim Hunter and bring him to Faerie originally published as Arcana Annual #1. While those who haven't yet picked up the Sandman or Books of Magic series are urged to read at least a way into those first, The Books of Faerie are quite a treat for those who have wandered off into the thick layers of mythology and symbolism Neil Gaiman imbued both series with.As with the whole extended series of graphic novels of which this is but a part, The Books of Faerie is a treat well worth savoring. ***"
1,Ridiculous S+H Fees,"I like the way this product looks on the Amazon page. It's only $.79 ea, so I go to order 33 of them for my entire kitchen. I see that the total for the product is $26.07 and they want to charge me $4.49 EACH for S+H! A $26 order will cost $148 to ship?! Outrageous. I know this is through a third-party shipper, but it reflects poorly on Amazon that they'd let this type of thing to happen on their pages."
5,I loved this book,"Helen Nearing does not mince words. She tells it like she thinks it, which is part of the beauty of her style. This book will make you thing about the way you eat, and what you feed those you love, so get ready to have some assumptions challenged. I have used some of the recipes in this text, and have not been disappointed (try any of the salads or the banana cookies for a snack)."
5,Fun Puzzle,"This puzzle was so much fun to put together. The colors were beautiful and the final picture was just amazing. It was a challenge, but not so hard that it was frustrating. Highly recommended."
5,GREAT FAMILY TIME,This was definately one of the best ideals for any down time for Christmas for our family. We spent several hours talking together and putting the puzzle together. This would not be a puzzle for children under 12 yrs. of age. The colors were beautiful and very challenging. I would suggest buying this puzzle.
5,"New, great!","YoungBlood has what no every other band seems to forget-energy. They're not restricted by musical paradigms like most other musicians. They are accomplishing their goals, and I can't wait to hear what their next album sounds like. Great work guys!"
2,Can't stop dancin'...,What a party! These dudes can get any crowd up on their feet (and keep them there!). I haven't heard this much energy from a musical group in years! Buy this CD!Then get out there and see em live! What a show!
4,Terrific New Orleans style jazz!,Great dancing music. YoungBlood has developed their own exciting energetic style.
5,these guys are da bomb,these guys are the bomb. I think in a couple of years these guys will be doing world tours. I work with one of the trumet players and he got me listening to there stuff and i am glad he did. The beats are great and it makes me wanna get up and dance everytime i listen to the joint.
4,Reads like poetry,"I feel lucky to have found this book. I fell in love with Lily and Julian and I crossed my fingers for both of them. The descriptions are beautiful and who can't understand what it is like to love someone who wants to love you back, but for whatever reason (and there are many)find themselves unable? Rogers does a great job weaving their past and present lives together...A great read."
3,Ford tractors early to 60's,"Most of the info in the book is for the early years to the early 60's, very little info for later models.Early years is covered very well and informs on the design and process of getting the tractors to the customers."
5,History of Ford Tractors,A very informative book for anyone interested in the evolution of the Ford tractor. Loaded with color photos. I would recommend this book for restorers and early tractor enthusiasts.
2,Not worth your time if you are a younger programmer,"This book was recommended to improve my algorithm skills. However, any younger person (< 30) should not buy this book. It is not an easy read. Might be because it was written in the 70's, but the author constanly uses large and complitcated words for no reason. Also, anyone who's code base is C/C++ will find it hard and annoying to read the books ancient language. I found myself reading each sentense 2 or 3 times just to understand the point. This book might only be $5, but its not worth the savings. Get a book that was printed in the same decade."
5,stresses important practical cases,"Levi's book differs from standard QM texts, in furnishing more of an applied bent. Directed towards those students in applied physics, materials science and engineering. For example, there is a superb chapter on electron propagation in crystals. Where we see how to describe propagation by transmission matrices. And how energy bands arise due to the periodicity of the potential seen by electrons. Of course, solid state texts also discuss this. But the treatment here of such ideas as tunnelling, and using the WKB approximation to describe that tunnelling in a semiquantitative manner, is clear and detailed. Plus, the examples focus on important heterostructures, where band gap engineering is important.For semiconductor lasers, there is a similar treatment. With comparisons amongst the common types of laser diodes, like GaAs and InGaAsP.The numerous problems and the copiously worked out examples are also a nice feature of the text."
4,"Just shy of a 5, but still great","The *only* reason I did not give it 5 stars was it dragged a smidge in the beginning. I thought there was a little too much setup/background and it got a little too technical in the tinkering and workings of the machine. Also, I at first saw the actors as acting and not as the characters they played.HOWEVER, then the movie picked up and went in a surprising and exciting direction. I also started relating to the characters and developing feelings for them. It turned out to be a really clever, poignant, heartfelt story. At the end, I even cried over the fate of the brothers. Ghost from the Machine is one of those that has haunted me ever since I watched it. (Keep thinking back to it.) It's WAY more than just a scary ghost story. It has a lot of soul."
3,Decent,2010R: A decent movie with an interesting look at the afterlife. The homemade feel reminded me of Primer (without the time travel). MFJLabs 3x
1,Lame and embarassing,Well I am a bit jaded because I live in a city where everybody talks and looks like Larry The Cable guy. If the people here don't resemble him then they resemble Ned Flanders from The Simpsons. So I get to put up with both extremes in real life. Why would anybody want to pay for this load of nonsense unless you are from a real sophisticated state or city and this to you is hilarious because you are laughing at how lame this obese comedian is. The blue collar TV show was mildly funny. This CD on the other hand is not funny. It isn't even crude or offensive. This humor is childish and bad and possibly young kids would think it was funny for a week but most adults wouldn't buy into this stuff for a minute.
5,I never held politics in a lofty regard!,"I never had a high regard for politics and seeing this movie strengthened that point of view. The acting was extremely well done and the ending was a typical situation in most of America's homes at that point of history.. Like ho-hum, what can i watch next! A disregard for the future impact on America! LEW"
2,Boring,"I found this version boring, but some of the acting was good. I bought it because I wanted to see it, and I couldn't find it anywhere to just watch it. However, I only watched it once without any intention to ever watch it again. So, if you do really want to see, I hope you can rent it somewhere. At the time I bought it, I don't think it was available on Amazon Instant Video to just rent. Maybe, that will change some time."
2,"Unredemptive message, but some honest material on childhood trauma","I watched this movie on a recommendation, and was disappointed. Found it mostly sickening and over-the-top, which, I suppose, is what the directors hoped for. Of course, the movie was shot well, the acting was superb (the guy who played Sweeney was brilliant), the tension excellent...but still.Largely an awful message: a traumatized, unfairly imprisoned guy takes out his anger and revenge on strangers who never did him any harm--by murdering them. Yet the basic one who did him the real harm, his father, gets let off the hook easy. Sounds so much like the overall message our whole society promulgates as far as blaming parents: blame anyone else!That said, if Sweeney Todd really wanted to do the world a service he would have figured out how to grieve. But it's a lot easier to be a raging violent child in an adult's body than it is to be a self-reflective, grieving adult.Thus: this movie was a pointless failure.Don't watch it."
3,Sweeney Todd,"I only got it because Tom Hardy was in it i didnt see this version of Sweeney Todd yet i seen the one with Ben Kingsley and Joanna Lumley, and i like seeing that movie maybe on my day off i'll see it"
5,An unbiased look at one of rock's most misunderstood bands,"Finally, the whole story on proto-punk, glam-rockers, The New York Dolls. Author Antonia (biographer of ex-Doll Johnny Thunders and The Only One's Peter Perrett), paints a picture of a band on the edge of everything: sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and fleeting fame. The Dolls' tale is a sad one. Too early for punk, too unruly for the music business and like the title says, too much, too soon. Antonia sheds light on the members' lives after the Dolls and the ending is not a particularly happy one. A must-read for Dolls fans."
5,Fascinating tale by one of rock'n'rolls greatest biographers,"Nina Antonia writes both from a fans-eye view and from that of a non-biased rock scholar who knows what ""it's"" really all about. At no point does she let her love of the band interfere with her duty of seperating the facts from the fiction. Full of ups, downs, and more downs, this is the definitive document on one the most mind bogglingly influential and, yet still, widely unknown and underappreciated groups in rock'n'roll. With this book Nina Antonia has rightfully claimed her place as one of Rock music's greatest biographers. In fact, if you ask me, nobody does it better."
1,baby shoes,"These shoes are for babies. DO NOT be mislead into buying these for anyone other than a toddler. This advertizement is very deceptive, and and gives Amazon a bad name."
3,Correction to nonono,"I live in Orlando, FL, but I am a Trini to de bone! If it's one thing that I know, it's soca...and I must set the record straight. The original song, ""Doggie"" was sung by Anslem Douglas of Trinidad & Tobago. It was redone by Byron Lee & the Dragonaires (as they do with most of the songs on their CDs). It was later brought to the mainstream audience by the Bahamen. Just had to clear that up. Have to give full credit where credit is due."
3,Some great tunes but....,"They should have used the songs by ALL of the Original Artists. Also, FYI to A music fan from chicago, il USA, Doggie was originally sang by Anslem Douglas and popularized (remade) by The Bahamen."
3,"well, okay",Fairly routine tunes here - nothing too interesting or too awful. Minus one star for including yet another [bad] version of Who Let the Dogs Out(entitled Doggie on this cd).
3,A fun movie with an interesting plot,"A must see if you like government conspiracy as well as a little bit of ""Spy vs. Spy"""
4,"funny, spunky and anti ""wergin"" training! ""We love it!""","Film now has historic implications as no wall or communism from the ""red menace"". Gives the impression of how life was different there than in the free world."
4,It's one of my favourites!,"I have literally watched this movie forty times, my sister and I can say the words as the actors do. I found it fulfilling a dream: how many of us wanted to be [a] James Bond as a child? The main character in Gotcha! gets to do just that! It is a spy adventure that is really worth seeing! The soundtrack is also a good one with Hubert Kah, et cetera."
5,Great movie,A great action adventure that just oozes the mid 80's. A great movie for Anthony Edwards.
4,"Classic spy games movie, and anthony edward with hair.","After his sucess with Revenge of the Nerds, Anthony Edwards stepped out of the plad trousers and tapped glasses and into the action world. Out about the time of Revenge of the Nerds II (and the reason Anthony Edwards was not in sequel), Edwards is Johnathan Moore, an 18 y.o. college kid that goes to europe with his buddy on spring break. Of course, they are hoping to scam on some babes. Well, Johnathan being so innocent falls hard for ""czechloslovocian born"" sasha, who was in paris on business. They hook up, and she invites him along to Berlin to help her on her Courrier run. Somehow innocent John ends up in East berlin with this girl he just met, and eventually ends up running for his life. Again, not the best action movie of all time, and the acting wasn't spectacular, but the storyline was original enough, and funny at times. Enjoyable movie, I recommend it."
4,A must see!!,The cast in this movie is wonderful. Lots of fun with a plot and story line that are realistic without being dull. A must see!!
5,GOTCHA!!!,"Gotcha stars Anthony Edward of ER and Jsu Garcia of Wildcats and Nightmare of Elm Street as two high school kids who go to Europe for vacation.Garcia, thinking he's a player, leaves Edwards to himself where he meets with up Sasha, played by Linda Forientino, who comes off as a very mysterious person with an awsome accent who takes interest in virgins.she seduces and uses Johnathan (anthony edwards) into going with her to the commuinst East Berlin for some business that she has to tend to. Edwards, being blinded by love, doesn't know what's going on, but soon will, in a hard way.Gotcha is an awsome movie with rich cinemetography as the film was shot in Europe.excellent movie!! i recommend it."
4,I have the VCS tape,"It's amovie about the cold war era, when spooks where abound and used unwitting people to do the dirty work for them."
4,What's not to like about Gotcha?,This movie is a classic. I harbor fond memories of watching Gotcha as a wee lass - my brother and I were obsessed with the movie and we can still sing the theme song. This movie is a classic for anyone who enjoys 80s kitsch!
2,Non essential reading,"Rosen's book lacks substance and good research. Some chapters are better than others, but alarmingly the more famous cases shows a real lack of research that even the most elementary of students will recognize to be errors presented as facts. As the previous reviewer pointed out (while so blatantly promoting her own enterprises) Lizzie Borden is a case in point.For any true crime affionado, this is NOT essential reading."
1,I guess it's unanimous,"I couldn't believe how many one star reviews this book garnered. Surely, I thought, its ambition and chitzpah alone would give it an extra star. How can you go wrong when you re-investigate so many intriguing questions?Well, I don't know how he did it, but Fred Rosen missed the boat here big time. Reading his book is like being stuck in a bar with the world's most boring drunk telling you his opinions on everything.The level of vulgarity and stupidity is total. For example, he asks rhetorically whether or not Lizzie Borden committed the murders in Fall River. His reply: ""Does a bear s--t in the woods?"" How classy is that, and for this sort of discourse we paid $14.95 for? What a waste of public space, and what a disservice this book performs all the way around. I had heard that he is a pretty good true crime writer, but if this book is any indication, Rosen's the bottom of the barrel."
1,How did this ever get published?,"I have not purchased this book. In fact, I haven't even read the entire book. The subject matter sounded fascinating; so I skimmed it on line. I have been studying the Lizzie Borden case extensively so I used that chapter to determine if I would buy the book or not. I will not be buying it. How could this writer not have even the simplest facts correct? He states that Lizzie was the elder daughter. She was the younger, Emma was approximately 10 years older. He states that Emma had her own residence. She was actually visiting friends in another town and lived with Lizzie and Mr. and Mrs. Borden. I stopped reading at this point. You obviously can not trust any of the information presented in this book. I do wonder how this book was published."
1,Who published this?,"The book itself is filled with with typos, and a lot of the ""facts"" are incorrect. I started reading it and I thought, is it me? Am I not getting it? Nope. Apparently everyone that has written a review has stated the same. Not worth a half-star. Don't they proofread these?"
1,Major disappointment,"The major disappointment with this book was the almost total disregard for the facts in nearly every case. Even the most well-known circumstances are ignored or miscommunicated by the author.Another disappointing thing was the horrible spelling and grammatical errors throughout the book, which makes it seem like you're reading a high school book report written by someone who did no research and didn't have spell-check on his computer. I expected a lot more from someone who teaches criminal justice at the college level."
3,Fun reading,"Very interesting read; I enjoyed seeing the evidence presented, for and against, for some of the most (in)famous cases in American history. Could have used a LOT less rants on the authors' personal opinions and politics, though."
3,"sometimes fun, but confusing","In this book, Ryoko becomes head of a band of women that is supposed to clear the streets of trouble-makers. While the characters were occaisionally interesting, there were really too many of them introduced in such a short time for to actually get to know them. I don't think this series has ever actually been good at allowing readers to get to know the characters, and this volume is one of the worst at this. The artwork is still goregeous, but the series is confusing and, for me, getting boring."
4,The 4th volume of Real Bout is a little off the mark...,"Truth to tell, I didn't like this volume as much as I did the others. It introduced too many new characters in too short a time for me to really connect with any one of them, and the plot seemed to stray from what it started as. But it wasn't a total loss. It was a fun trip and a new take on the world of Real Bout High School. The regular characters are still pretty cool and interesting to read about, and the art is still top-notch.So, fans of Real Bout, you should read this one! And if you aren't a fan, I'd suggest you start with the earlier books, otherwise you will be lost."
4,Clearly written step-by-step instructions!,"I just got this book a few days ago in the mail and it has helped me so much. It's a easy to follow step-by-step guide on how to create forms in Developer/2000. This is a great book for those who are learning Developer for the first time. The only problem I had was that the books instructions are from an older version of Developer. However, I was still able to use this book and code for Developer 2.1."
5,Awesome book,I have applied prasing good during the bad and good times to my own life. I can tell the difference when I change my point of view. God has a plan and I have to appreciate all apsects of life.
4,Self help book,"I sent this to my nephew in prison. He told me that he later noticed their wasthe same book in his counselors office. Nephew enjoyed the book ""of hope""."
5,His Own True Story,"A wonderful read! I recommend this book to any Christian struggling with what life is dealing you! Then I encourage those readers to ""experiment"" with what he learned for, at least, a week or two to reap great spiritual results even if the ""problem"" still exists. One needs to ""practice"" it often to reap God's PEACE & JOY!!"
5,WeatherTech,Great fit --should have bought these a long time ago. Will never buy anything else. Try them you like them.
5,Dipping into History,"This is a book for a scholar or a person dipping into Scottish history for the first time. An excellent book about Highlanders and there are precious few books available on the topic. The author has considered vast quanitities of sources; the only books lacking are Gaelic language sources such as those bilingual editions published by the Scottish Academic Texts Society. The author shows a broad understanding of the politics and economics of the period; what is unique is an attempt to understand Gaelic society. The ""creach"" or cattle raid is explained from a Highland point of view; it's a custom sanctified in the great Gaelic epic ""Táin Bó Cuailgne"". The format is very appealing as historical events are related to the colourful life of this one honourable man."
3,Perhaps it's time for an editor,"""Suitcase"" is, like everyone else said, not for newbies to GbV. It's probably not even for some diehards. A few too many of the ""songs"" are half-baked fragments that are too low-fi for even me, and I love GbV's earlier work represented in ""Box"" and pre-""Alien Lanes"" albums. There are still many gems -- probably about half the songs here are typically bright and shiny pop gems -- but it could've easily been culled down to 2 CDs instead of 4. Don't expect greatness, and definitely try to find it marked down from its original price a little. An interesting artifact for GbV fans in the end."
4,Great on road trips for Pollard fans,"Fan club product? Perhaps. There are great songs on this and Suitcase II, and also tossed off lo-fi *recordings* that bring you as much into the basement recordings as being part of early GbV. If you have a bunch of Bob related material and listen to it again and again, then you already understand what this is. You get it. You will need this eventually, but it will be out of print by then. If you don't own Hardcore UFOs yet, get that first. Then buy Suitcases I & II together, all the EPs you don't already own, all the new Robert Pollard, and find the torrents for the live boards and so on.... Ruin your lives. Oh, and if you haven't picked up a turntable and started collecting vinyl again, see ya."
3,More for diehards,"The no longer mythical songs from Pollard's suitcase are finally released. And while there are definitely enough great tracks on the 100-song set, it's not exactly the indie-rock salvation you might be looking for."
2,Looks like nice quality but too short and filler pipe needed,Sorry but ordering this was a waste of time and return shipping. Muffler looked well made but selling truck it was going on and wanted more OEM. Almost foot shorter than original and I did not want to goof around with making filler pipe then when people looking at truck for purchase that would be the first thing a hear when they try to chew you down. Should be closer in size and something said about some though not difficult modifications needed. I looked at description and I guess I should have read more the dimension are given but should be more up front about being Universal
3,Halloween monster,"It's ok. I thought my kid ended up looking more KKK if it had been white than elementary goofy 'skeleton' guy. My son is 52# and 48"" tall, and medium fit perfect."
4,Good Low Cost Robe!,"We only paid $8/robe (all-in as it qualified for super saver shipping) so certainly didn't expect an ultra-high quality robe but this item was very workable for our needs. We had a Harry Potter party for our son's 8th B-day and didn't want to pay $300+ or nearly 3X the cost of these for robes alone. These are light-weight, come w/a hood and sash if you need to re-task it and was reasonable well constructed. The only real down-side for us was that they are polyester and we wanted to affix iron-on Hogwarts House patches which was not a possibility as the robe would melt. Overall, they are a great vale."
5,Tools and Thoughts for Living,"I've read this book twice...underlined and highlighted all that struck me as important to know. As a consequence, the entire book is marked up. Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan describes spiritual truths in understandable, easy to grasp and conversational terms...good for Western minds trying to incorporate different ways of thinking."
5,Unforgettable Guy,"I only crossed paths with this guy about four times. I first met him in 1980, a mere twenty seven years ago. We never had a conversation, which makes it even stranger. In retrospect, no single person in my entire life made a deeper impression on me. This may sound like some simple-minded devotee but I'm really not. IT surprises me that this is so. I just find in retrospect this guy was one of the seminal meetings of my life, like having a fleeting encounter with einstein or bach or swedenborg or john the baptist. Anything this person wrote should be taken seriously and read in a relaxed but careful, thoughtful way. At least that's my thought about him (he died two or three years ago). People like this are especially important in this age of the insipid. I'm not sure how much of himself could be contained in a book, though. His beingness was the message. Best of luck in your spiritual lives."
4,The beginning of CSI,"The movies were good, but not as good as the TV Series I had watched. My sister had given me the first season for Christmas.I really could understand the resistance to accepting finger prints etc., now days it's blood splatter or dirt and algae."
4,British mystery lover,This DVD made for three evenings of enjoyable entertainment. Some of the comtent was a little raw for my taste but as a whole the story lings and actors were good.Shirley
5,Peter Outerbridge is great and stories have human interest angle that makes this period mystery come alive.,"Great show with Peter Outerbridge as Murdoch, much, much better than later Murdoch series which lacks human interest or fails when it tries. Normally I am put off by injection of personal lives of detectives into the shows, but this is an exception, perhaps because it is a period piece (about 1900).Subsequent series is okay, but the second Murdoch series lacks true to life performances, which are required for what is supposed to be a realistic show. Yannick is okay. This show is popular and I've seen six episodes. Better than most t.v. cop serieses, but could be so much better. WRiting is probably the problem-also very low production values--little money for sets and extras. This is usually okay, but in this show, being a period piece, we need better sets etc. Still, if you have Netflix and don't have to buy the dvd's this show is worth watching."
2,Short Attention Span Theater,"I am a fan of the old detective drama: Sherlock, Poirot, Columbo and even the corny Ellery Queen. These more modern productions lack the intelligence, good writing, good acting, and taste of the older series.These seem designed for the modern audience who can't focus for more than 30 seconds and need constant quick changing angles, and lots of graphic nudity and violence to prevent them from tweeting their friends in the middle of the movie.The actor in the movie series is better than the guy who played in the TV series, but still, the casting is so Holywoodish. Where are all the character actors?If you really have nothing to do, these aren't too bad compared to the trash that is on TV today, but don't expect much if your IQ is over 90."
3,NUDITY,Didn't get very far into the film. Was put off by frontal nudity of a dead woman as someone was taking her clothes off. Then we enter the brothel and more nudity. We stopped there.I guess I didn't read enough reviews here to get to the NUDITY warning.It's too bad that some film makers don't leave ANYTHING to the imagination.
1,"boring, boring, boring","After reading the reviews and hype around this set of movies, I was looking forward to it with great anticipation. Well, amazon.com took 8 days to get it to me. When I finally got it, I started the first movie and it is so boring...not much movement, confused storyline, it looks like they are more interested in showcasing 1890's Toronto that in stringing along a good mystery. Even the characterizations are so much formula...the detective who lost his love and is full of angst, the woman coroner, the curmudgeon superintendent...yeesh, are we seeing Inspector Morse all over? Alas, the stories are just not that interesting."
1,Performance is not all!,"I can't say nothing bad about the performance of this machine.As far as quality and reliability are concerned though, the Lenovo machine is really a poor laptop ... light-years from the old IBM TinkPads, which I have been using professionally and privately for more than 10 years!I had to bring my NEW Z61m back for repair after a week of use (freezing and blue screens). A couple of weeks ago, exactly one month after the warranty expiration the monitor suddenly gave up! A nice Christmas present of more than 500.- $ in repair costs! Thanks Lenovo!"
5,really good book,"I read this book in my 12th grade history class. I learned lots of stuff I didn't know about all the Latinos (Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, etc.) from this book. A previous reviewer didn't like the book because it concentrates on the U.S and not Latin America, but he misses the point completely. This book is about America and Americans with Latin American roots. It's not about Latin America and Latin Americans. I just want to add that I gave my mom this book to read and she really like it too."
2,Novas: A Culture Vulture,"The book on Latino history is not bad, but it is nothing special. She has simply re-written the work of her researchers. So yes, it's a good primer, but it is rather glib (After all, Novas wrote an article about sightings of Tejano singing star Selena's ghost for The National Enquirer. That doesn't do much to boost her credibility as an historian.) Advice to knowledge seekers: this is educational junkfood. Get a textbook."
2,The book had one too many mistakes. Definitely a thumbs down,"At first, I was excited about reading this book. I figured it would be a great way to get a general overview of Latino history. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. While Novas did cover a variety of topics, I found that MANY words throughout the book were not spelled correctly and there were quite a few ""facts"" that were just not true. For instance, the music group, Menudo, is NOT Mexican American---they hail from Puerto Rico. I would DEFINITELY not recommend this book to anyone. Latino history deserves more respect and should be presented accurately, especially since many times it is a subject that has virtually been ignored."
5,Excellent,"This book is an excellent opportunity to learn about major aspects of the Latino community and their culture. It is a must read for bilingual teachers, and every person who considers themselves Latino."
5,cultural subtleties,"Santa Fe, New Mexico has a strong hispanic heritage dating back to the Conquistadores. The area has become a magnet for other Hispanics from other areas. As a psychotherapist, I work with native New Mexicans, Puerto Rican, Mexican and people from other countries of origin. This book is extremely helpful in describing the historical and cultural details that can influence the individuality of each person. It is also excellent reading. Very informative and well written."
4,"Her second best CD, Evolution is her #1","This CD is great and produced hits ""Safe In The Arms Of Love"", ""Cry On The Shoulder Of The Road"", and ""Wild Angels"" which is my favorite Martina song of all time. This CD is really a 4.5 but had to give it a 4 star so it wouldn't eclipse Evolution as her best. Buy this one along with Evolution and you will be hooked on Mrs. McBride!"
4,Superb example of commercial Nashville country,"On her third LP, McBride sings with tremendous confidence and power, bringing to mind Linda Ronstadt and Bonnie Raitt. Her emotions range from the resignation of ""Phones Are Ringing All Over Town"" to the hopefulness of ""Safe in the Arms of Love"" to the exaltation of ""You've Been Driving All the Time."" Also featured is the doubtful kiss-off ""Swingin' Doors"" and the boozy blues of Delbert McLinton's ""Two More Bottles of Wine."" The production is polished, with a punchy, energetic edge. The vocal arrangements, including a guest harmony from Levon Helm, perfectly underscore the lyrics."
1,Did I miss the ending?,"I was drawn to the plot of this novel for approximately the first half...it appeared to be heading in a definite direction. Then, when the ""initial"" principal character committed suicide, the plot changed direction...and I missed it, I guess. The focus of the narrative seemed to get lost and wound up with no particular purpose that I could follow. After a few chapters of this aimless wandering, the book just ended... Maybe that's similar to the haunted lives of some who have seen the horrors of war. I'm still not sure what it was all about.Jim C."
5,Wonderfully Lena!,"If ever there was a fine example of Lena Horne's work, this is the album. I first heard the album as background music at a dinner party, and paid more attention to it rather than to the party banter. Having heard other Lena albums, this one is most captivating, and wonderfully, Lena. The title track,""Love Is The Thing"", is fresh and different. ""Where or When"", a song never on my personal top hits chart, is now in the top ten. But, the jewel of the album is her version of ""Darn That Dream""! Wonderfully recorded and produced, with timeless and undated arrangements, the album could have been recorded today."
4,Top notch writing and acting!,"This UK production dramatizes the real-life story of Staff Sergeant Caroline Meagher (Helen Baxendale - Cold Feet, Unsuitable Job for a Woman) tasked with investigating suspected lesbians in the British Army. The job was a difficult one as Meagher was a lesbian herself and fighting to hold onto both her job in the Army and her girlfriend (Laura Fraser - Nina's Heavenly Delights, Lip Service). Homosexuality was a criminal offence in the British military until 1994.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide"
4,Gives the standard big bang model,"Prof. Trefil gives lots of info on the Big Bang, including 5 reasons galaxies shouldn't exist. He believes scientists will eventually discover cold dark matter to explain why most of the universe is not detectable and why galaxies could form in the early universe.His writing is a bit disconnected, making it harder to find related information. That's why I gave the book 4 stars."
3,history of the jewish people in the age of jesus christ,I only used this book for research in paper.
4,Nice pant but a little baggy,I am happy with these pants and like the tighter fit with zipper at the calf. But with wearing them for about 2 months have found them to be getting baggy in the hip & thigh. They seem to be wearing a little prematurely and I don't think they are pants that will look good for more than 6 months.
4,One of the Best Biographys I have Read!,"I am 11 years old I read this book for my book report. ""On and Off the Ice"" had plenty of funny stories about Dorthy Hammil's skating career. The only problem with this book is that it barely talks about Dorthy Hammil's life ""off the ice."" In the end I got points taken off on my book report because I only told about her life as a figure skater. Some of you will be interested in the fact she married Dean Martin Jr. son of Dean Martin who she met through Desi Arnez Jr. (Little Ricky from I Love Lucy) Overall I loved this book and I think that most people will like it."
5,An Adventure Book- First Degree!!,"Here, the Adventure Librarypresents three true stories dealing with hunting man eaters, two tigers and a leopard, in India by Jim Corbett, with the original illustrations by Raymond Sheppard.The binding is superb and the book is an asset to those who seekhigh adventure. Thanks to the publishers for producing such a beautifulbook!"
5,Excelent DVD,"This is a high quality video with some of the best in-flight pictures of a P-51 Mustang I have ever seen. The story line is very good and I connected with the family of Jim Brooks on a personal level. My father flew B-24 and B-29 bombers in WW2. I visited the only flying B-29 with my dad once and video taped it myself. I also was able to connect on a different level too. I've flown in the back seat of a P-51 on two occasions and the statement in the video that you can't fully understand what it's like unless you have been there and done it is very true. I am also a licensed aircraft mechanic and I've worked on a P-51 so I connected on that level as well.This is an excelent video on many levels and it is one of the prized DVDs in my colection. I highly recomend it to any ""Warbird"" enthusiast. A heart felt ""Well Done"" to Chris Woods and his crew."
4,Excellent teaching resource.,"This book has concrete lessons in how to paint. The illustrations, even though many are black and white, are more informative than many other books on the subject because they are photos of well painted examples (not computer generated images) that show the techniques in wonderful detail and with clearly demarked tonal values.The color illustrations are not just rehashes of the black and white images, but include inspiring examples of scenic painting. If I have a wish, it would be for even larger images."
2,Defective Item - Can't Return,I purchased two of these Dewalt DW7232 supports but one had a defective finish on top surface that could scratch or mar prefinished items such as moldings. I tried to return it for an exchange but the Amazon website return procedure would not process my request for some reason. There is no phone number I could find on the Amazon website for help in returning an item. Next time I'll order from another source that responds to their customer's requests.
2,Poor engineering,"I bought the dewalt stand a couple of years ago.The stand itself is well engineered, well made.But when they got to this support arm, apparently someone went to sleep, didn't care, whatever. Dewalt really failed with this one."
5,The DW7232 can help reduce your setup,I have the Dewalt miter stand that included two DW7232 stands however I was doing a large project that needed multiple stops both long and short. Instead of moving the existing DW7232 stands around constantly I added two more of the DW7232's on the main rail and was able to cut down the number of stop changes in half. In addition these added support in the middle to the long piece of wood that I was cutting. I just wish I had purchased these sooner.
4,Good but expensive,"This is exactly what it says it is. You only get one, which seems a little expensive. But that is the norm with any dewalt accessory that I have ever bought. If it wasn't for the price I would have given it a five. Having four stops on the stand makes it more efficient, safer, and easier."
2,The new Clive Cussler?!?,"James Patterson must have been paid well for his cover blurb praising Ted Bell because he couldn't possibly have read Hawke and made such a ridiculous statement.The concept of the Alex Hawke character is a good one and should have worked but in Bell's hands, he manages to make him the most boring character in the whole story. Others have pointed out the technical errors and the awful dialouge, so I won't go into it here. The subplot involving a hispanic Marine stationed at Gitmo, is the only part of the book that is well written. In fact, the writing is so superior to the rest of the book,it suggests to me that this book was written by committee. I see that Mr. Bell is a big shot ad exec. It must be nice to have friends in high places. I'm sure it helps alot in getting your work published,even if it is sub standard.As far as being hailed as the ""new Clive Cussler"", Ted Bell couldn't sharpen CC's pencils."
3,Disjointed,"I found this book to be an interesting read that was VERY ""choppy"" to read. By that I mean the author jumped from one section of the novel to another without any lead in at all. If I were to compare it driving a car I would say that the car was jerking very hard every time it shifted.I felt like the author could have done a bit more research on the various military equipment written about in the book to at least lend some ""reality"" to a work of fiction.All in all, not a total waste of time to read but definately not something I would recommend to others to read. Perhaps his other books will be better though!!!"
1,If only there were negative star ratings...,"This book was beyond awful. The author paints the main character as this unbelievably perfect, handsome athletic, educated war hero that also happens to be super rich... and he's a total jerk. A secondary character, Stokely is a former Navy SEAL but the author makes him seem like a runaway slave from the Civil War. Racism and misogynism aside (every woman in the book wants to bed Hawke), the ""action"" is slow and childish. Skip it; this book is total garbage."
2,"""A-Team"" Level Story","I found myself wondering whether this book would have made it into print if the author were not a former vice chairman of a global advertising agency. The characterizations are trite, the main character comically overblown, and the action scenes like something out of the ""A-Team"". There's no sophistication, no subtlety, and seemingly little research to support the book. It's OK to read (although it could have used a stronger editor to fix mistakes, clean up style--Mr. Bell obviously likes to use the word 'obviously'--, and reduce its repetitiveness), but it's a long distance below the likes of Clancy or Ludlum."
1,Terrible - not worth the time,"As a rule I try to finish every book I've started, even the bad ones, if for no other reason to see how it ends. In the case of Ted Bell's Hawke, I had absolutely no misgivings about putting it aside. This is possibly the worst book I've ever read. Nevermind that the plot is completely disjointed, the characters unappealing, the dialogue facile; this story is lame and pathetic.On the upside this book was given to me as a gift, so at least I don't feel the disappointment of wasting money just the time I spent suffering through the first 100 pages."
1,"Poorly constructed ""adventure"" novel","This debut novel was displayed in the front of both Borders, as well as, Barnes and Noble, with both stores pushing it as a superior and fun summer read. It should be a swashbuckling adventure novel but it has to rank as one of the most poorly constructed books I have read in quite some time.Alex Hawke witnesses the death of his parents aboard their yacht by pirates when he was a child. He has since grown to adulthood and works for both the CIA and British secret service. He is assigned to look into the disappearance of a Soviet sub that could launch strikes against the US mainland. Of course, his assignment eventually takes him into the direct path of his parent's killers.Don't waste your time on this downright idiotic almost unreadable work."
5,"""LIBRARY JOURNAL'S BEST 2004""","Caveat emptor and don't believe everything you read here, e.g.,unlike some previous reviewers who quote almost verbatim from the book descripiton printed above and clearly haven't read page one of this book, I actually did! There is a reason it was chosen as one of LJ's Best First Novels 2003...it is a wonderfully realized thriller with highly sympathetic and believable characters. As Library Journal says, ""the action is made entirely believable through meticulous detail...""Hawke is a winner in every way and I can't wait for the sequel...and the movie!"
2,Hawke Character too much of a Superman,"Disappointing to me. Hawke character is written to be some kind of a superman.I like my heroes to be a bit more realistic, with flaws that he or she still overcomes.I don't recommend it."
2,Hawke is a cry-baby,"Lee Child, Vince Flynn and Brad Taylor know how to write a proper tough guy. Clive Cussler knows how to write a proper adventure seeker. Ted Bell mastered neither with his slobbering Hawke."
1,Absurd,"Absurd plot points, stereotypical characters, inconsistencies abound. And this is just through the first few chapters. I didnt even bother finishing it. Very disappointed."
3,Hawke,Book did not measure up to hype for the author! Way too predictable for a good thriller...maybe the authoer did better in later efforts!
1,HAWKE by HACKE,"Ted Bell has admitted on camera to ""having a teenage brain."" That gives him too much credit; it's more like a 12-year old's. Why bother with this dreck when there are geniuses like Ambler, Deighton, Greene, and LeCarre available? Just sayin'..."
2,Beach Read,"This book was fine for reading at the beach which is what I did, but it is predictable and simplistic. A lot of the explication is repeated many times, plus there is a lot of psycho-babble that gets very tedious. However, I may read the second book to see if Mr. Bell can improve on a cool character in Hawke."
3,Hawke,"I enjoyed the book, because it gave me a background to caulks childhood. I don't know if this is intended to be the first of the series because the book references earlier escapades. It would be nice for publishers to make note of the sequence of an author's work so that when there is a series you would know where to start."
1,Horrible,"If Bell left out any cliches I would be surprised. From terrible dialog, laughable stereotyping of characters, ridiculous plot with an unlikely (to say the least) coincidence, to one of the most (unintentionally) comic finales this book has it all."
5,Hawke review,This is another great Alex Hawke novel from Ted Bell my current favorite author. His character development is outstanding. He continues in the same way as Cussler you just can't wait for the next novel to be published.
5,Ted Bell Blows Me Away Every Time!,"Ted Bell writes like a world class chef! He prepares the various plots by adding immense detail while keeping the reader interested and not overwhelmed. He allows the main character to not only be rich enough to go after anyone and anything he desires, but gives him the assets and skills of his pirate history and a modern day ace fighter pilot, and then adds in that he is also an accomplished sailor and scuba diver. This give Ted Bell a wide range of possibilities that are seemingly endless. I have read all of his books in this series and they are indeed page-turners, leaving me anxious to turn off the television and head to bed to knock out the next one hundred pages. Unlike Stuart Woods and his same price but much shorter books, leaving you a desire to enjoy the experience far longer, Ted Bell spends the time to give his readers a worthy book that is filled with the best adventure possible. I suggest everyone eat before reading, or you'll end up hungry!"
2,Seriously lacking in research and proof reading,"Ted Bell's main character, with his 'toys', is an inferior imitation of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt. I appreciate books that include a map of the story area. Unfortunately, Bell ignores the map and local geography. He tells of a boat sailing in the Straits of Florida that is caught in a hurricane. Hurricanes in the Caribbean move northwest, yet this boat is driven about 800 miles to the southeast toward Hispaniola. A plane is described as taking off from Martinique and flying north over Trinidad and Tabago - wrong, Martinigue is several hundred miles north of these islands. The plane then skirts the southern coast of Haiti and turns due north to the southwest coast of Cuba. Wrong again, the southwest coast of Cuba is about 800 miles to the west-northwest.This book is so full of holes it woulld sink if it were a boat."
1,He's been compared to Ludlum.....,This author is compared to Robert Ludlum? I can state that he is no Ludlum. The prime character Hawke is unbelievable. His confrontation in a pub while wearing a tux or tails. His special plane designed after a model. The bowsprit on his yacht that extends? The machete fight? Give me a break.
3,Entertaining,"This book reads like an action movie script - fast-paced, exciting. The dialogue is a little trite and the characters are kind of cookie-cutter, but it didn't stop me from finishing it."
1,Cussler Wan-a-bee,"This novel was bad. I was ready to quit after four chapters. The errors in research scream out like nails on a chalk board. I'm glad I didn't quit reading though, because I would have missed the ground attack with Sidewinder missles and the Wrong Way Corrigan flight plan. All in all not worth the time to read, and you wonder exactly what the famous authors quoted on the jacket read, because it certainly wasn't this book."
5,"""Outstanding!""","This is a seriously good adventure thriller. I loved every single minute of it and only wish it had kept on going, I was having so much fun. You gotta hope there's another one in the pipeline and and whole lot more...so cool to have Cuba in a thriller since its so close and so believable...Fidel, read this book and start watching your back, buddy. Wow, some book!"
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"The most disappointing thing about Ted Bell's first novel is how low respected authors like James Patterson and Nelson DeMille would go to hype a book that is so silly it borders on the ridiculous. Mr. Bell apparently decided to create a character who fulfilled all his fantasies and place him in a world so overblown with unreality that the plot collapses under its own weight.Alex Hawke, whose ancestors included a famous pirate, somehow goes from professional soldier to billionaire business tycoon in about a decade. He would have been so much more believable if Mr. Bell hadn't tried to make him be everything."
2,Not Bond or Bourne!,"This book began with much promise and blurbed comparisons to James Bond and the Clive Cussler novels had me anxious to delve into this swash-buckling adventure.The prolouge, where 7-year old Alex Hawke witnesses the brutal murder of his parents aboard their yacht is gripping and the promise of a revenge saga filled with pirate adventures awaits.Unfortunately, this nearly 600-page novel cannot hold up to the promise of the prolouge as it becomes another sodden espionage tale about a coup d'etat in Cuba that the now adult Alex Hawke is hired to stop. The group behind the coup turn out to be three Cuban brothers - the same trio that killed Hawke's parents many years earlier.There is not one second of swash-buckling or piracy in this tale and the revenge is dealt with so quickly it is as if Ted Bell lost interest and just wanted to finish the book and move on with the Hawke series.I sure hope the rest of the books in the Hawke series are superiour to this poorly constructed mess..."
4,Hawke soars!,"Though not Clive Cussler, and Dirk Pitt, Alex Hawke may be the new adventure hero to watch. Obviously Bell copied Cussler's writing style, in giving us a hero with a personality much like Dirk Pitt, and a side kick a lot like Al Giordano in Ambrose Cosgrove.Enough action, and a great plotline, involving modern day pirates, and a Cuban Coup to keep any reader interested till, as the Brits say it, ""The Bitter End"".The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the authors gratuitous use of sex scenes, and blamphemies, that as a Christian, I felt was unnecessary, offensive, and kept it from being a book that I would reccomend to a young reader.Still, all in all, a good read, and Several more books by Bell will prove him to be an heir to Cussler's Pitt."
1,BORED TO DEATH indeed...,"Very low level of humour, childish characters, predictable plot. This is by far the worst piece of comedy I have seen in a very long time. If you liked season one and two, don't spoil it with this. I generally like Jason Schwartzman and Ted Danson (Zach Galifianakis not so much) but they do not make up for this dilemma."
5,wonderful,This has been the FAVORITE train book for my two kids. Excellent fun to read aloud. We've renewed it from the library six times.
3,TEKTON,Good tray to have handy for DIY or mechanic it holds to surfaces very well when in use and has a strong feel .The problem with the tray i would say that it easily leaves scratch marks which was very noticeable after the first use but really i think you would buy this more for its performance than appearance.
3,Lesser of two Gullivers,"GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT issued their _____ and other Cartoon Treasures series in two formats:1.) A 90-minute disc packed in a heavy paper jacket (as this one is),and2.) a plastic slimline cased DVD containing 2 full hours of cartoons.The superior 2-hour version ofGULLIVER'S TRAVELS AND OTHER CARTOON TREASUREScontains everything found here, plus several more shorts.(see my review by clicking on title)"
1,Too much cuteness.,"This album is just dissapointing. After her last live album, I was expecting more challenging vocal pieces. Everything on this record is recorded as fluffily as possible.Her voice sounds terrible on Money Changes Everything. The slower arrangement on She Bop is inadvertantly funny. The Puffy Ami Yumi appearance is just silly and distracting. Ani DiFranco is buried on Sisters of Avalon. The only highlight for me was the Sarah McLachlan turn on Time After Time.None of these versions transcend the originals. The new songs have some nice singing, but have forgettable melodies. Perhaps I'm taking pop music too seriously, but I thought Cyndi at one time did, also."
4,Gotta love Cyndi Lauper,Acoustic versions of some of Cyndi's hits plus some other great numbers. I have to say that this album was just wonderful for me!!
3,Not very interesting.,"I wanted to buy this because I always liked Cyndi Lauper's music and love acoustic versions of songs, for the most part. This album just isn't interesting to listen to, though. The vocals aren't very prominent and the instrumentals aren't either. So... nothing really stands out as good or bad. It's just kind of blah."
1,Guitar Tab notation unreadable,"Warning: The guitar tab notation is unreadable! While the ink quality was very sharp, the typesetting crams the guitar tab numbers together so they overlap each other wherever multiple strings are struck (chords, etc.). OK for the single note parts, but impractical to read otherwise. I am not even talking about print being too small or blurry...it is actually overlapping so each set of notes must be deciphered or guessed at in some cases!Check out the page preview yourself at the bottom of page 26...it's like that throughout the book.Too bad, because it's a great collection of songs..."
1,Bad Print,"My copy's print was so bad, it was not readable in areas. I sent mine back. I can't say anything about the accuracy of the tab."
1,False advertising,"The appearance of the ad lead me to believe that this was the music CD set.It was a paperback book. I tried to stop the purchase hours later after theemail confirmation revealed it was a book, but Amazon was no help. I refusedthe delivery, and sent it back to the supplier unopened (at my expense), butwas still refunded only a less than half of the purchase price (""re-stocking"";nonsense). I appealed to the supplier, but no response. Will never do businesswith ""bookrackrh"".JF, New York"
5,"A CLASSIC, AND HUMBLE PIE'S BEST RECORDING","This is the real thing. Everyone says how Humble Pie only became great after Peter Frampton joined that group, but let me tell you, that isn't so. Sure, they sold more records with him in the lineup, but with him there they lost the EDGE that makes this album so great. This is hot and nasty, folks. It embodies that feel of the early 70's, a funky, bluesy, soulful time. ALL THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE GOOD, and some are outright classics, like ""30 Days in the Hole"", ""C'mon Everybody"" and ""I wonder."" If you know what's good for you, GET THIS, put it in, and turn it up. That way, you'll be able to hear the music over ""the bare feet slappin' on the floor"" (song lyric). ENJOY!"
5,rock and roll history,"I have to agree with reveiwer #1.This album is as classic as they come.Steve marriot sings some of the hottest blues rock tracks I have ever heard.This album is a must for any collector.Buy this album,Roll one,grab a cold one and hang on."
4,What rock used to sound like,"This is a band that really captured the essence of rock. Never get tired of listening to them, and only wish more was available."
5,Dazed and Confused.....,70's rock at it's arena rattling best. Should be heard at deafening levels through Panasonic Thruster speakers taking up most of the back seat of a '69 Chevelle....
2,Poor audio,"I was so looking forward to this CD. I had the original album. When it came I found the sound quality was terrible, almost like t was muffled. I actually returned the CD and got another one, thinking it was a fluke. The 2nd one also sounds terrible. i don't know if they need to remaster the disk or what but as is, I would not purchase."
4,Stop Wonderin',"I bought this album in 1972 and never stopped listening to it (now the CD, not the LP). While not Led Zep II, it's right up there. And ""I Wonder"" -- which no one here seems to ention -- is one of the best blues-rock guitar pieces I have heard, topped off with Steve Marriot's awesome vocals. That one tune is worth the price of admission."
4,Used to have on vinyl,"I had the A&M; vinyl back then and promptly wore the the grooves off of it. It was totally wrecked and unplayable by the time I had to throw it out. That's how much it was listened to...The only dog track on there was ""I Wonder"", a horrible blues number that I couldn't stand. Eeech...But the rest is classic..."
3,Disappointingly Incomplete,"While ""Into The Millenium"" was largely complete, and the ""Posthumous Papers"" obviously not, even the completed section lacked the structure of Vol. 1 - the external characters and environment gave way almost completely to Ulric's evolving thoughts on emotion and love, intermingled, at times, with those of Agathe on similar subjects. While it gave an interesting insight into Musil's thought and creative processes, it was not overly satisfying, and a little disappointing. However, Vol. 1 was so satisfying that Vol. 2 can be forgiven."
4,The Man Without Qualities Vol 2,"A very good novel. IF...you are serious reader, enjoyed Proust, and do not mind listening to people prattle on endlessly. I do not mind the prattle, because I think it helps me become a better conversationalist."
4,Brando Makes This Work,"Chilling, tense, compelling take on The Turn of the Screw. Brando plays a ruffian gardener/caretaker who has some of his very own ideas about life, love, and nature. He has totally under his spell the two newly-orphaned children living in the house, as well as their buxom nanny. The story is fascinating from the first scene and never lets up. Danger is ever-present, yet when it strikes you are shocked and surprised. Some of the sex scenes between Brando and a lovely young Stepahnie Beacham push the envelope, to the point where you would almost call this softcore, because of the exposed personal parts and the S&M nature of some of these scenes. Some also might be disturbed by the two adolescent children playing at some of these scenarios, they having spied on the couple at night. But none of that is gratuituous, it is all part of the story, and if that doesn't bother you you will love the film."
1,One of thee WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN,"I absolutely adored the 1960 movie The Innocents with Deborah Kerr. Amazing psychological drama. This movie was is the ""pre-quel"" to The Innocents.. It could have been an amazing movie but it was so sloppy and cheaply made and Marlon Brando was walking around in muttering in some kind of an odd ball Irish brogue...just pure awful. Brando at his worst right before the Godfather saved his career and made him a movie god forever more....dont waste your time on this piece of s*** movie"
2,Rather dull and stagy despite the scandalous subject,"This has been on my radar for a couple of years. It's largely what I imagined. Michael Winner was always little more than a journeyman director, and the film plays out in a rather stagy and arch way. Brando and Beacham are good, but the children and housekeeper are merely adequate. All in all, it lacks atmosphere and confident pacing and ends up rather dull, despite the scandalous mix of sensuality, brutality, and death. In the hands of a more skilled director, I think the middling script could have supported a cracker, but it sort of reaches for Hitchcock and Zalman King and falls significantly short."
4,The Night Comers,"I'm a big fan of Stephanie Beacham so I purchased this video. It's a very strange movie, but I did like it--but not the ending."
2,'MINUETS IN THE MANSION',"Or, ""Minute Man?""This is director Michael Winner's spin on Henry James ""Turn of the Screw"" - the early years! Filmed originally as ""The Innocents"" [unsurpassed original] this is the so-called prequel, famous for starring Brando as the depraved Quint and Stephanie Beacham as the somewhat ..deviant Governess [but old Quint does teach her a thing or two].AND it does go on and on and on - especially the ""bedroom"" scenes!Not really memorable, it was, I believe, made after the far superior ""Last Tango in Paris"" - and Mr. Brando, with all respect, still has a waist-line in this one! [Just kidding, we adore him in all guises!]It's supposed to be a movie/script about the [downfall] of innocence - in this case the two minors [the children]. AND it does somewhat solve the mystery surrounding the strange death of Quint and the Governess......Of interest? The Operatic version - Benjamin Britten's ""The Turn of the Screw"" - quite adult, an excellent version available on video."
4,Excellent Sequel - A Keeper,"I was genuinely surprised at how much I liked this book. It's a sequel to ""Geography Club,"" andwhile I also enjoyed that book, after reading it I traded it at 'paperbackswap.com' (great site to trade paperbacks for free) for a credit towards another book. Not in this case. ""The Order of the Poison Oak"" is a keeper. Well worth the read."
2,Narrow,"These Birkenstock's in ""N"" are truly narrow. My foot is not wide at all but it was uncomfortably tight so I had to return them. Please be aware of the fact that Virtual Exchanges charges $10 restocking fee for all returns. :("
1,Does Not Have Birkenstock Footbed!! Fakes!!!,"These shoes do not have Birkenstock Footbeds, they do not fit like Birkenstocks they are saying they are by Birkenstock and they are NOT!!!!!!!!! don't be fooledlike I was, Im so dissapointed, they are scammers, pay full price buy the real thing from a real Birkenstock supplier."
1,Just a Survey History,"This book is a just a survey of one year in a crucial period of history. As it rightly points out, England gained the mastery of the world. However, it is just a Polaroid picture of the Seven Years War. Any serious student of history may easily skip this book and you will have missed very little."
4,A great start to an importnat year,The seven years war changed the face of the world. The year 1759 was decisive in the conflict of the war and established Britain's naval supremacy from America to India. Frank McLynn does an excellent job in all of his books explaining the context of the times. He clearly outlays how the British Empire developed. The naval battles are some of the most important in history and he explains the new tactics of the British navy. He also begins to show how this war will lead to American independence. This book is NOT the definitive book on the war and for that see Crucible of War by Fred Anderson.
2,Incomplete,"This very detailed history suffers from several omissions:1. While describing complicated military maneuvers, there are no maps to enable the reader to follow what is happening.2. There are no notes to the text despite numerous references to obscure events.3. The author seems obsessed with his own erudtion, leaving the reader to flounder amongst the excessive and superfluous details."
5,Great product for a great price,"I looked all over the internet for this item at a good price. Bike stores, Amazon, eBay, etc. etc. Finally found them ON SALE here on Amazon. Saved about $40 form regular price.These tips are very good quality, and made of HEAVY metal. Easy install, and look GREAT on my bike. You need to get the rear one too."
5,Life-affirming and goal-oriented,"Author Tom Hardin is a financial planner, but this book offers much more than ways on how to increase your wealth. This is a positive, upbeat, life-affirming book that encourages readers to plan not only for their financial futures, but also for lives that are emotionally and spiritually fulfilling, and as physically healthy as possible.He offers examples of people who have planned carefully and thought about what they wanted to do with their lives, and who are now living the best lives possible. This is NOT a book of vague generalizations. Hardin offers specific suggestions and guidelines, and encourages the reader to think deeply about what s/he wants out of life. Then, he says, act on those goals!You can't pick this book up without catching some of Hardin's optimism and energy. And I intend to pick this book up and peruse it many more times!"
5,Great for Storytime!,"Using acrylic paint, foam board and plaster to create his colorful illustrations, the artist and author has created an entertaining look at the heavy equipement needed to build a bridge. Each double-paged spread has one or two sentences describing the action. A turtle who gets in the way of the construction workers is never mentioned, but provides humorous visual action in the story. Although the illustrations appear bold and simple, there is enough detail to invite close inspection of each picture. This will work very well as a book for a child to look at alone, and for use in group sharing, such as storytime."
1,This book should be recalled,"I have bought this book immediately after it was published and I didnot have a chance to see others opinions about this book. I do understand that writing a book is a very difficult task, but misnaming and misdirecting it is unpardonable. This book is good for its knowledge base, but I found it not so useful for Step 3 of USMLE."
2,"Painful as a blunt drill, did i mention it was AAA battery powered?","Why in the world was this book created? I ask myself that because I looked through it and looked through it, finding that there were oceans of useless informaiton servedt to me on drab pages. The words seemed to run togethe,r the facts seemed so spread out, and then I saw the test it was supposed to help with and I thought - how?I coudl think of a few reasons this would not work. the color blurs into one banner of bland. It hurts to have your eyes swallow it. It makes you tired and numb. As far as the awareness passed on goes, you would never need this. It has a million things to say but the retention cannot be great. so, really, are you getting a nice little shiny penny for your troubles?a magic eightball gives me a little to recall - I think the two have the predictive powers of one another only I have not seen the stats on it. 2/5; it does have alot of 411 for your mind."
4,Babelicious B movie!,"Yes this movie is incredibly cheesy, and campy, and so obviously B grade with more than your average plot and character pot holes. But, the presence of the always magnificent Chow Yun Fat is enough to make this enjoyable eyecandy!"
2,Super Reader,"An inter-generational conflict between a group of powerful mages, Lilah Morgan, and a dodgy cop of the mystical variety cause a few problems.Angel pretends to be a Mage, Gunn writes an Angel send up comic, Connor and Wesley fight a few demons.Fred ends up working on a Quantum Cosmic Engine after a babe geek friend of hers is killed.This all ties together, sort of. Not very well, though."
3,blah,"so much potental so poorly written. the writers obviously made a few character flaws and well, they left out quite a bit. it was very confusing but hard to read? idk mixed good and bad hence the three . not one of the best. if your looking for a good angel/ buffy book. read moster island. way more worth the timE!!!!"
2,Waste of money,"The explanations in this book are mediocre at best. Going into the exam, I'm probably at about a 650 level but really want to score higher. I bought this book primarily for the tests on the CD rom. You can only get your results for the CD Rom tests by logging onto the Princeton Review website. Unfortunately, no matter how much I've tried to explain to customer service that my results are not being authenticated, they can't seem to resolve the problem. So I spend hours on the tests and have no idea how I've scored.I'm going to buy the Kaplan book instead."
4,Overall a good book but need more detailed explanations on solutions,"The book is overall pretty good, and you should definately take advantage of the software and PR's website for more resources. However, I feel that the book needs more detailed explanantions on solutions to many of its questions. For many questions that I got wrong, even with the explanations, I still cannot fully understand why they have to pick that particular answer. Some explanations seem rather vague to me."
5,"Quick, reliable service.","The product came within a week, and it was in the condition described. I have no complaints with this seller in the least."
4,Death theatre,"This may not be a spaghetti western film. It is more like a play in four acts,about revenge without meaning, made into a spaghetti western film. So it turns out a spaghetti western after all. If you get me. If you do, it's highly recommended. If you don't, let it pass. The Koch release couldn't have been better."
3,Brilliant but maybe too brilliant,"I have to concur with most of the 5 star ratings for Mr. Hawking's pseudo-escape into gangsta rapping. Ken's lyrics are brilliant and hilarious, which makes me want to rewind my cassette, listen again and sing to myself in my car or in line at Microcenter.The gimmick of the music, MC Hawking's electronic voice, is holding the music back for me. Keeps the music from leaving it's kitschy value and moving into respectable, listenable hip-hop. Fans will say that I've lost the point of the whole concept, Stephen Hawking uses a electronic voice box... But when it comes down to it, I'd rather here his genius through the vocal cords of an avatar capable of emotional inflection, not a mostly monotonous machine. Pi stars for the lyrics and the premise. If you like or can get past the voice box, you'll enjoy MC Hawking for a very long time."
1,Lamer than lame.,"Gets old after about 30 seconds. Hawking rehashes his mediocre schtick over and over again but its not listenable music by any stretch of the imagination. It seems that these amazon album reviews self-select for positive ones but its still jaw-dropping that this album is 4-5 stars. Don't waste your money. (or even bandwith) Seriously, don't."
5,Wonderful on an odd sort of level,"Well, what to say about this one? I had a friend turn me onto MC Hawking, and I haven't regreted it a lick. The songs are fun and funny, and the CD will keep you entertained for years. Buy one...or 40....because everyone you get it for will love it (except those who object to foul language)....-Mark"
4,Good General Overview,Very good for a general overview of understanding the use of art as yet another tool when working with children. I had the impression after reading the book that there is no hard fast rule and everything should be taken with the consideration of the larger picture. Very helpful.
3,Good not great,"I bought this book for a friend who is a pediatrician interested in child psychiatry and art. It is an interesting read, but I had hoped there would be more examples of children's art. There are indeed several examples, but it is a somewhat dense and very clincially oriented book. Since I'm a visual person, I would have liked even more pictures, but I would still recommend this to people who work with children."
4,Wish I could afford the hard copy,The book is lovely. Altogether a good buy. I just wish I could afford the hard cover!
2,too much illustration,"not enough facts.many pictures ,but not what I was looking for in a Celtic bookI would recommend it to somebody as an art work piece"
4,Not bad,"Could use more illustrations of the actual book , there are a lot of words, I bought this book to get a look at the art work done in the book rather than to read about the artwork, so I wish there were more images rather than descriptions."
5,Very good.,"This book has just what I hoped it would: good, sufficient-sized images of the book of kells. (I'm sure the text is good too, although I have not yet had time to read it. I purchased the book mainly for the images, but my quick glance of the text proves satisfactory as well).I am VERY happy with this purchase, and would gladly recommend it."
4,Apple skimmed out on the memory,"This product has potential. Its small form factor is great. However, out of the box you're limited unless you upgrade the 512 Megs of memory. These days anything less than 1Gig is too small. Disk space is also small but there are add-on coordinating products (ie. miniStack V2) that you can attach to address this limitation. I swapped out one of the 256 Dimm cards and replace it with a Gig which resulted in a 1.256 Gigs of Ram. Now I am happy with its performance."
4,"Beatiful, small, quiet, fast.",A great computer. The 512 MB of RAM it comes with is not enough though and will degrade performance. Install at least 1 GB and you'll see this thing fly. Highly recommended. Awesome as a HTPC.
1,Full of Lies,"Please, I can't believe the reviews on this book. We must not have been reading the same book. The only thing this student learned from his teacher is how to lie. The teacher acted worse than her students. The only thing this teacher had in common with her boy toy student was who could tell the most lies to HIS mother. No respect what so ever. This was a no star book, I only gave it a star, because I had to give it something in order to print."
5,My A&A Challenge,"This book was good. I enjoyed how see did his view, her view, and the fly on the wall."
3,Hottest Sex!,The plot: English teacher starts a sexual realationship with a 18 year old senior.The reason to read the book: HOTTEST SEX SCENES!Trista knocks Zane out of the running with the hot sex in this story. I had to put the book down at work because it was going to cause the smoke alarms to go off! I also loved the dialog. The book was off the chain funny which made it that much better. This is the type of book you read on a plane ride or at the beach. Before you know it you will be turning over to the last page. I too as a pp said hoped for more detail surrounding the aftermath of the affair. I will def. be checking on other titles from this author.
4,wow!,"This is the first book I've read by Trista Russell. It was indeed a pageturner. There were some twists you didn't expect. I could not put the book down until it was finished (2 days). I would recommend read to anyone. My only problems was when it was coming to the end, it seemed that she didn't know how to and thats is why the twists in the end happened. Also I was over the fly after the introduction. Still with that you can't take away from the rest of the story. Wonderful book-- I look forward to the next but first gotta go back and read goin broke!"
5,One of the Best Books for 2006,"This is a must read. This book will take you through every emotion you can imagine and still have a few surprises. Also, this is a good book to share with a significant other because the sex scenes are HOT! HOT! HOT! but not vulgar. I recommend this book to all who read and those who don't will fall in love with it. Trista, has done it again. Can't wait for the next book."
4,If only to be a fly....,"This book was interesting and had some good scenes per se. The relationship between the teacher and student was one that should have NEVER happened but since he was 18, who really cares and it is a BOOK. Let's remember that. If you want a quick interesting read please grab this."
4,How to be teachers pet,"This is a controversial but very well written, funny, sexy romantic story. It's one of those where in real life the whole idea makes one uncomfortable but makes for good fiction - 32 year old teacher dating student who is 18 (even tho legal). I wonder if the teacher was male and the student female would most of us be as sympathetic? For me even tho I enjoyed reading this the only thing the two seem to have going for each other was great sex I don't see them suriving the tempations and the pitfalls of the NBA and consider how many 18 year old young men meet the love of their life in the body of a 32 year old woman? Will there be a sequel to this story I hope so cos it sure needs one the end seemed too cliched - oh well its just fiction."
5,This Book Will Leave You Speechless,Oh my God...I'm so speechless I read this entire book in less than 12 hours I just couldn't put it down everytime I tried I would end on a sentence or statement that just left me wanting more. This was my first Trista Russell book and I can honestly say that I'm still in awe I was so outdone by this book that all I could do was sit and stare at the wall in an effort to regain my composure...I wish there was like 100 more pages to read or something this book will have you so caught up that you'll never want it to end...I'll definitely read anything else from Ms. Russell...I'm even thinking about sending her an email this needs to be a movie or something...Needless to say I still SPEECHLESS!! Please get this book you wont be disappointed until you realized that you've reached the last page and your still wanting more!
4,Very good,This books started a little slow for me I wasn't feeling the whole fly talking thing but after I kept reading it wasn't so bad. This book was extremely good and I would recommend it to all my friends.
2,Less than believable.,I found the dialogue between a 30+ woman and an 18 year old just a little far fetched. I just couldn't see a grown woman responding to a child in that manner.
5,So good it needs sequels,"this book is so good. If you ever or never held your breath while reading a book,this is the one. While reading I pictured myself reading sequels 2 this book playing on the fact of the title,how many times you wanted 2 be a fly in several places. So 2 the author take that idea and run & write us another fly on the wall. NOW!!LOL"
5,ONE WORD: AMAZING,This book was amazing from start to finish. I read it all in ONE DAY. I could not put it down. Trista is a great author. PLEASE DO NOT SLEEP ON HER!!!! You won't be dissapointed in this book. I promise!
4,DAMN GOOD BOOK!,"This book was almost perfect in my book. It had romance, emotions, and just the right amount of steamy sex scenes. Although, the book was really really good, two things stopped me from given the book 5 stars. One, I think that Paige could have resisted a student a little bit more. It doesn't matter if he's fine and all that, she was still his teacher and it would've been better if she resisted him just a little bit more. Secondly, and I don't want to give away the book but I wish her best friend would've had better luck towards the end. Those who read the book should know what I mean by ""better luck."" I did however LURVVVV Theo's character. He's been so ""good"" at everything he did. I think there should be a part 2 but then again I don't want things to get all f*ck up. Otherwise, this book was a BANGAAAA 100%. Ms. Russell definitely found a new fan."
5,WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO BE A FLY ON A WALL,"WHOOOAAAA..... Loved this book, loved book of Trista's books I am on the the third one. Great love story, Theo was true to his age, he was in love with an other woman but was still tempted by girls his age. Only thing I was sad to see is what happen to Toni, I've would have love to read a spin off about her, but now that won't happen. Paige is lucky to have found Theo, and if there is a sequel to this, I hope it works out"
4,Go head Trista!,"I would like to start off by saying Trista Russell can write her butt off!! I dig her writing style, but I couldn't get into the whole Paige and Theo story as a couple. Because Trista can deliver a story so well I gave her 4 stars but I found myself skipping certain parts especially when it came to the two of them as a couple. I couldn't fathom this eighteen year old superstar basketball player with his whole life ahead of him willing to give it all up for a long term relationship with his teacher, maybe a fling or a one night stand but nothing more. Then the character of Paige was funny but not appealing. She was described as being sexy and beautiful but from reading the story that's not what I picked up. Theo on his own was a much more interesting story to me. But Trista Russell is very talented and I will buy her next book."
5,Great Product,"The Mailbox insert was easy to install and worked as promised. Our HOA would not allow us to change the box to a locking mailbox, so the insert was a big win."
5,remy,ONE OF THE BEST SINGLES I'VE HEARD IN DECADES. A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR RAP/HIP-HOP/R&B/POP COLLECTION!
1,Dietl Worships Himself,"Dietl probably has a nude portrait of himself smoking a cigar above his fireplace. The man is truly enamored with himself. You might find a few kernals of winsdom entreched deeply within the 200+ pages of steaming poo, yet not enough to justify blowing twenty bucks on it. The constant self promotion and tales of small-man syndrome conquers evil bad-man will wear you down by the time you find the end of the book. Then you can read a special song written by Paul Anka for him, which takes 25 or 30 pages.Maybe he'll sell you his nude portrait so you too can worship him."
5,Excellent,Used first time on a 350 mile trip a couple of weeks after having received. Surprised how well the luggage fit my 2007 Hayabusa. Gripped so well almost seemed that no tie down was necessary. Held everything I needed and would have held more. Got compliments from other bikers at gas station. Extremely pleased with product and supplier.
2,No help here!,I've had fibromyalgia for a few years now and this book was recommended in some other source. I was most disappointed at the lack of real information. Way too expensive for a paperback with little applicable information.
2,Not great,"I bought this for my two month old cockatiel about two weeks ago. And it was good the first few days. He uses it everyday. It's very cheep quality. The ladder spacing is very tight and my bird got stuck in them. My advice, spend the money on a good play stand. Not one that you'll have to re glue a few times like this one. Hope this helped."
4,Fun play area,"Was easy to put together, I did use wood glue rather than what was sent in the kit. Our cockatiel likes to chew on it & its fun to watch him use the ladder."
2,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"This product was a disappointment right out of the box. The materials are flimsy, the swing and ladder were both out of square, the holes in the main dowel are drilled at an angle so the main support piece leans. The long dowel holding the rope toy doesn't touch the bottom of the playset, seriously undermining its stability. This playset is NOT large enough to comfortably accommodate a cockatiel. My bird, Paloma,can't fit in the swing and the ladder is too small. I strongly dislike the product and regret this purchase."
2,"OK quality, poor design","I purchased the LARGE activity center, and it is too small for my lovebird! It's listed as ""for Cockatiels and Medium Birds,"" but I imagine even a parakeet would feel cramped.The rungs on the ladders are so tiny my lovebird avoids using them completely. The glue helps hold perches in place, but I had to duct tape one of them so the whole set wouldn't collapse. The swing is much too small, and the base needs to be 5"" wider so the ladders aren't so cramped.I give it two stars because my bird likes the rope, upper two perches, it's a good surface for shredding bird kabobs and paper without much cleanup, and it's relatively cheap compared to other playsets. Having a playset is a must if you have your bird out a lot, but if you can afford it get the extra large or, even better, pick another brand!"
3,ok,my bird loves this house so much i am going to order the larger one a little hard to clean and needs reglueing often but otherwise a good product
2,Not happy,"I had a hard time putting the activity center together. The glue provided just would not hold!! I didn't want to use anything that could be harmful to my birds. I have one cockatiel and four parakeets who enjoy new toys. It finally held but not sturdy enough. The worst was when I tried to rinse it off, after being in the bird cage for a couple of weeks, the color on the wood bled all off!!"
3,A good book about a researcher in his field study,Researcher tells first hand his experience with the Ainu. Great photographs as well.
5,Got me working Hard...,"As a mother of two children, I had a hard time losing my weight even after 3 years having my son, I didn't had the stamina to work out. I decided to purchase the book and test it for my self, and guess what here I am inspired by this womanwho knows it best..My goal is to lose that baby fat that I've been carrying for three years, and how I am going to do that??Have you read the book called Lose that baby fat!!! I stay home and work out next to my kids by doing the Interval #4 Sit-ups...Thanks LaReine Chabut you inspired me!! I love you!!"
3,It has good ideas.,"This is a good book for motivation, but it lacks structure. The exercises are easy and could help you slim down. But they are not set up to be done together. Each chapter has new ideas, but it isn't designed to be done in a circuit. It's a cute, motivating read. But I wouldn't use this as my go to book for post partum weight loss."
1,someone should mention that you have to get an exercise ball,"I purchased this because of all the good reviews but was immediately disappointed when it came in the mail. EVERY SINGLE exercise depicted in this book uses a giant exercise ball. So if you, like me, do not intend to purchase an exercise ball, DON'T bother buying the book."
1,It's NOT a MAP Sensor,"I searched Amazon for a MAP sensor for my 1999 MX-5 Miata and this is what came up. This is a TPS sensor, NOT a MAP (or Boost) sensor."
5,Oh yeah,"Some of these are very well known and are not rare, which is the claim of this album ""rare ska"". Typical Trojan same songs different package. But , Get this album I never had a vinyl collection so most of these I would never have heard if this wasnt released. Ska music baby. If you are a rudie get it. Buy It cheap folks dont get scammed by these inflated prices on reggae music."
1,Not any Cha-Cha I've heard before.,"I bought this based on the prior review...Now I wish I had saved my money. I could only hear the ChaCha beat in maybe 2 of the songs and I've been competing in ballroom dancing for over 3 years. Some had more of an American Rumba beat, while the rest were more of a Mambo beat. I think that from now on if I can't preview the songs, then I probably wont purchase the cd based only on others reviews."
1,Joke,"Any resemblance between this music and Cha cha cha is purely fictional. I have been a Cha cha cha dancer my entire life. and find this CD a sham. The artists had the gaul to present this music as cha cha cha. It is obvious that they do not know ballroom, at least, Cha cha cha. I should get my money back."
3,"beautiful, but be careful if you're a fan of the books...","First, the cinematography trumps all weaknesses. The German was not a distraction,it's a soft, southern German, although of course I too wish Italian television would have picked up this series. (For me the distraction was comparing Patrick Diemling to Tim Lincecum.) Brunetti is true to character, but Patta did not seem incompetent/arrogant enough. Vianello' philosophizing is a treasure. My negative reaction concerns the choice of these two episodes to open the series. Plotlines in many of the books deal with emotionally-charged political and social issues, but rarely in such gruesome fashion. Some of the scenes stayed with me for a long time."
3,Brunetti - not so much,"I was disappointed. After watching all the Commissario Montalbano series we were hungry for more. We had problems with the German language. This is filmed in Venice with German actors speaking German. This may sound silly but it's hard to transport your mind to Venice when the language is wrong. The scenery was not as good as in Montalbano either. It seems like there are a limited number of shots you can make in Venice. Brunetti comes across as a bit wimpy and PC. Do cops act that way anywhere in the world? This guy is always smiling and smarmy and apologizing to the bad guys for the inconvenience. Who does that? The stories are simpler than Montalbano. It's a serial progression of things and somewhat boring. With Montalbano there are other things happening that may or may not be part of the story, it's keeps your interest up. The big thing I miss is the rich characters in Montalbano. Brunetti's seem two dimensional and very formulaic. Not worth the money."
3,Better w/o the soundtrack,"Great stories and videography, but too bad there isn't a version dubbed in Italian. The guttural Germanic soundtrack literally adds a discordant element, and is, in my view, just disturbing. And I studied and speak German!"
1,Better in Italian perhaps,"The Donna Leon books are my favourites but this dull rendition of them to the screen in German, no less, fails to catch the wonder of the original novels on which the series is based. The character of the very Italian Brunetti fails to materialise."
2,Problem reading subtitles,"I received these for my birthday, but cannot read the second of the subtitles on my Samsung HD television. Has anybody else had this problem? I love the books, and would love to see them set in Venice."
3,Guido Brunetti can only be Italian,"Another reviewer who admits she has not seen this production. . . but come on now. . .a German Brunetti? I can imagine only that wonderful Italian actor, Giancarlo Giannini in the role of Commissario Guido Brunetti. Isn't he the quintessential Brunetti, after all?"
1,Brunetti Mysteries episodes 1&2,"No one bothered to mention these episodes were in German or perhaps I missed the fine print. To hear Italians speaking German in Venice is, to say the least,disappointing. The most beautiful language in the world traded for one of the most guttural.Signorina Elettra would not approve. One of the disks was defective and would not play the final ten minutes of the episode. Skip the video and just read the books."
1,poor postage,Would have liked to enjoy the Brunette mysteries but they were not packaged at all well and were damaged in transit. The central clips both broke and so the surface of the DVDs is scratched. One works with the scratches the other won't read at all.
2,Brunnetti,Scenery of venice is beautiful but the series is in german which was very disconcerting and diminished its appeal. The actors don't look italian or act like italianss either.
2,"It's very German and not Italian at all, which is a big problem","If this series had been completely reset in Germany, I'd probably give it 4 stars.But the stolidity of the production, and acting (especially by the actors playing the Brunetti family members, with the exception of the actress playing the teen-age daughter) contrasting with the Venice locations and Italian situations and characters , creates a level of unintended absurdity which for me makes the series very hard to watch."
1,Not the Dolly we need!,"Most of these songs have been well anthologized elsewhere. What we need, in short of actual reissues of DOlly's early, pre Hollywood/pop sellout, is a first rate collection of stunning early songs like ""Down From Dover,"" ""Gypsy Joe and Me"" ""My Tennessee Mountain Boy,"" ""In The Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad),"" ""Just The Way I Am"" etc.Volume 2 in this series helps with this problem a bit, but does not go nearly far enough. For now it will have to do, but by and large, Volume 1 only emphasis the need for a more representative collection. Get Volume 2 and avoid Volume 1. This may be the only way we can correct this continued oversight."
2,Could be a lot better,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this volume of the ""Essential Dolly Parton"" series is a far cry from the second one, but as redundant as this one is it does include her, until now, unreleased version of ""To Daddy,"" a song she wrote and originally recorded by Emmylou Harris."
2,Don't trust the stock photos!!!,"Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of Imation products.I bought this device to match my existing 1GB imation thumbdrive.Amazon did a wonderful job on price, and the shipping was very quick.My low rating is due to the poor description and photo for this item.I buy Imation thumbdrives because I want a device with a write protect switch, its pivotal in my line of work.Sadly this device doesn't have a write protect switch as is implied by the stock photo.In fact it doesn't even look like the photo.Do your homework before buying these devices or you will be disappointed as well."
5,A MUST READ!!,An exciting biography of how God can work in the life of a committed person. It will certainly redefine the word sacrifice for you.
3,Bix is the best,"Bix is the best!!! This CD is clearly not...This CD does not really honor Bix the way he should be honored. It is a good listen, nevertheless."
3,kind of slow,This started off good but got really slow fast they repeat the same info mor than once in different episodes like they run out of ideas or text
4,Nice Job...,Seller was very accommodating in every aspect of the order processing. There were some mixed up but apparently was fixed. On time delivery.
4,Love these types of entertainment..,"Nobody really knows why old Nostra actually penned his wisdoms, but the guys at history channel certainly revs up your curiosity with their imaginative assumptions.. Maybe their right.. Maybe not, but certainly interesting entertainment."
1,Very misleading title .,"This book has a very misleading title . This books tries to put down the ministry of Ellen White And attacks the prophetic gift of Ellen White . If you are looking for a good book on Ellen White , I would suggest any of Dr. George Knight "" Meeting Ellen White "" or Ellen White under fire by Jud Lake ."
5,"Great, fast read about a young man coming of age in WWII","This book brings to life the feelings and emotions a young man experienced while coming of age in four theaters in WWII. As a Gunner on an LSM boat, the young DiMatteo, who quit school to join the navy, had to make many decisions. Some of his situations are of a serious nature, and some are of a more comical nature. The book deals with the camaraderie that men can experience in the harshness of war."
3,Collector's item,"Granted, it's a bit pricey for the relatively scant info that it delivers. There are much better and infinitely more detailed books out there nowadays, but it's still a nice piece for something written so long ago... and by one of the premier Japanese aviation experts of all time! It's good to finally own this out-of-print book and add it to my Osprey collection."
3,GOD tsunku!,"morning musume's 28th single-I forgot what it was called in japanese, but the meaning is like ""the fish I let go is big!"" or something-A remake song of one of the tracks from their 6th album.devided into 3 groups-pink:konno asami, niigaki risa, kusumi koharu, michishige sayumigold:fujimoto miki, kamei eri, takahashi aiothers(no specific color):tanaka reina, yoshizawa hitomi, ogawa makotomy overal review?MY GOD TSUNKU!!this song is like really~weird comparing to the great song and dance performed by the girls in their 27th single irroboi girettai. Plus, no part for ogawa or hitomi. the gold group gets half the attention of the whole song. REALLY unfair. When is niigaki and ogawa getting a main in the song??so I gave a 3, since I can't give 1 or 2 in generosity seing the girls in cute uniform. I mean, I liked their official photos(lol)"
4,A good retro-laced EP,"If you're going to go retro you've got a fine line to straddle. Go too far into homage and people wonder why you're even doing it (hello, that Orgy cover of ""Blue Monday!"") If you play up the satire end of it, you sound too much like a novelty record. Ladytron does a good job of setting themselves up in original territory without getting too smart for their own good. The EP sounds good, and part of it may be the short length of it - I wonder if the full album would just grate after a while (another reason to keep the EP format alive!) The punchy beatbox attack of ""Commodore Rock"" is fun, reminiscent of those great Afrika Bambaataa discs. The other side of the coin is the more laid-back ""Play Girl"" that balances beats with a languid vocal. A fun EP."
5,umbrella story,"A heart warming story, about human relationships. Using computer technology to bring together stars of the 50's and modern day, a la Forrest Gump. Very different from your high box office hits."
3,Good QA but weak in QM/CQM/TQI,"This is by far the best book on the market dealing with radiology QA. It is well written, easy to follow, and give the current criteria.The major weakness of this book is that it claims to be about ""Quality Management"" but it is not. The one and only chapter on this is almost worse than none at all. If the book was retitled ""Quality Assurance in the Imaging Science"", I would give it five stars."
2,was not true on the quality,It was told that the book was like brand new but it had a big cut on the side of the book.
1,Made for Single Men,"This book is not for couples interested in the ancient text of India. This book is very general and is more like a Penthouse pictorial than a love making manual. Does not show genitals (male or female) in any way, and treats the text of the Kama Sutra the way a male magazine would. Don't buy this if your interested in the Hindu religious text, buy it if you like pictures of women enjoying sex with faceless men."
4,"The ""Completer Item""...","This was a surprise. I've never actually seen the inside of one of these before; I'd assumed it was all ""open space"" under the lid. Wrong. There's actually a cylinder in the middle into which one puts their Q-tips (cotton swabs, whatever). Then one stuffs the cotton balls around it.Go figure.I would have given it 5 stars, but instead of being able to use this to *replace* having bags/containers of cotton balls and swabs, due to its lack of interior space, I'll have to use it *in addition to* having bags/containers, and just keep said bags/containers out of sight.Oh, and it, like its fellows in the line, isn't dishwasher-safe, yadda yadda. Other than that, it looks good, does the job, and surprisingly, *doesn't* take up much sink or bathroom real estate, unlike its fellows. Go fig."
5,Quality bathroom accessory,My wife and I just finished remodeling our home and were looking for accessories locally. We found nothing appealing or of the quality we were looking for. We then looked on Amazon and found these wonderful high quality Steeltek products. They arrived and as expected after reviewing they were as advertised. High quality and very well made. They look great.......
5,Excellent book depicting some incredible wood sculptures!,"If you are looking for inspiration , then this is the book you want. Full of great wood sculptures. Excellent book on an incredible carver, a true master of the craft. An excellent book for any sculptor that wants to view true works of art."
4,Great looking/feeling shirt.,"This is one of my most comfortable shirts. I wear it to work and when I go out. The textured aspect of it makes it durable and easy to care for. Sometimes it wrinkles when I sit for long times, like at meetings, but overall it's a great shirt. HIghly recommend it."
5,filosofical and practical,"An inspiring book on leadership as a quality of being.It is a balanced mix of a filosofical base, life lessons and practical tools to apply in everyday life. The different aspects of Mr. Van Praag's cv seem to be reflected in the book: the academic, the psychotherapist , the consultant and the trainer (and founder) at the Edge, international school for leadership and spirituality."
2,"""Bichemical Pathways""...Great content, Poor Presentation","Comprehensive references of bochemical pathways are not common, especially with well described cofactors, modulators, and interactions with disparate pathways. This book could provide such a useful reference, unfortunately, the quality of the layout is so poor as to make it very difficult to read. Poor graphic quality, exceptionally small fonts, and poor color choices render what should be a most useful reference into a visually challenging document. At the price, the book is a disappointment, although the content is great. One wishes that the editors would rerelease it after completely revising the graphics and production quality, as the content is indeed very useful."
5,Good reference,I used this book in grad school for biochem. I continued to use it out of class for other reference needs and for helping my undergrads. I still use it every now and then if I can't remember something because it's easy to use.
2,Disappointed,I generally do a lot of research into the product reviews before confirming to purchase them. I chose these for the novelty concept and was very disappointed. They fell apart the time my son used them and seemed to be merely a cheap set of binoculars with a small green light on it. You get what you pay for in this case. Consider spending the extra money if you are looking for quality.
1,this stinks!,This toy sucks! The ''invisible'' light is just a light! People notice it and it is not fun. trust me
4,Good for a 4-year old.,"Not really night vision but it it a fun toy! Here are my other ten ten ten ten ten words,."
4,They work sort of....,"These goggles are great for little kids, but older children dont care for the limited visibilty of the goggles, other than that they are pretty good."
3,Mom after 11 year olds comments,"My son is 11 and likes to play army, this apparently was the wrong set of goggles, they are not infared and have little power, eye holes are also quite small. It is still fun to have the googles but they are not infrared."
1,Much ado about nothing,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old grandson...While I didn't expect it to be state of the art..I did expect it to live up to its hype. It did not. My grandson complained of not being able to see anything..hard to focus....a piece of colored plastic over a cheap pair of glasses would have produced the same ""night vision."""
3,No complaints from the kids,"It's basically red-lensed binoculars with a little light attached to the top, but my boys liked the way the light slides up into position when they press the buttons to turn it on. They use them as regular binoculars, night vision goggles, and as a simple flash light to play with the cat :-)While it was not exactly what I expected it to be, my kids were more than happy with them."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my nephew's birthday and was really disappointed. The ""lights"" would not work. My nephew told me that I bought him junk. His cousin has one (purchased somewhere else) and it works great."
1,a great disappointment.,"My granddaughter was excited to receive this for her birthday but unfortunately, it arrived broken and was a great disappointment."
1,"CUT POORLY!!!!!,NOT A GOOD VERSION!!!!! DON""T BUY!!!!!",LOW QUALITY. BAD CUT! NOT ONLY IS IT RATED BUT IT'S CUT BY A BLIND IDIOT WITH A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT! SERIOUSLY BAD UNWATCHABLE VERSION. IF YOU'VE SEEN THE REAL ONE THEN THIS IS A SUPERIOR INFERIOR PRODUCT! AVOID! I'D RATHER HAVE KEPT THE BAD PICTURE VHS THAN THIS ATROCITY! PLEASE SOMEONE PICK UP THE DROPPED BALL AND RELEASE THIS UNCUT!!
2,sick? no. boring? yes.,"i have seen this movie on dvd and frankly i dont understand why people are calling this movie sick. honestly there is nothing shocking or gory. if you are around 15 yo, than yes buy it and youl will find it interesting. people over 15 should think twice. it is pure waste of time."
4,Mirra Coat Powder,"So far this seems to be working well. My dogs eat it with their food. I cannot determine how much it helps the coat, but it is overall beneficial."
5,Pet hair,"Seems to be helping my dog, her hair is beginning to grow and it is easy to use in the dogs food, Thank You."
4,"Perfect size, but beware these are not made in the USA","Very nice, functional size appetizer plates. However I have many items from the Lenox Tin Alley Collection, and they are all made in the USA. I was excited to receive these appetizer plates until I flipped over the plate and saw ""Made in Taiwan"" on the sticker. Luckily, there is no mention of where the plates are made on the back (all of my other pieces say Made in USA on the back). I will also note the ""Tin Can Alley"" logo on the back is larger than the Made in USA pieces, but I doubt any guests will notice. It's disappointing these were made overseas, but I still think the plates are a great addition for anyone that collects this pattern."
3,A Cool Little Book To Have On Your Table,"Filled with tips on how to survive a b-movie, this book is pretty well a showpiece for your living room when friends come over.It contains pieces like 'As A General Rule...Don't Do Anything That Opens A Portal To Hell!'A fun little book with small sections devoted to filmakers and stars that talk about their experiences, Lloyd Kaufman and Gunnar Hansen are just a couple.If you like b-movies, this is a cool little collectors"
3,A Cool Little Book To Have On Your Table,"Filled with tips on how to survive a b-movie, this book is pretty well a showpiece for your living room when friends come over.It contains pieces like 'As A General Rule...Don't Do Anything That Opens A Portal To Hell!'A fun little book with small sections devoted to filmakers and stars that talk about their experiences, Lloyd Kaufman and Gunnar Hansen are just a couple.If you like b-movies, this is a cool little collectors piece, just to expect Shakespeare :)"
2,Dissapointingly similar to Counter-Strike,"This new version of DoD is just like Counter-Strike, except it takes place in WWII europe. It's disgusting how similar it is to Counter-Strike. While some people do enjoy this game over the older version, most CS or DoD fans hate v1.0 because of its very unoriginal nature. As far as upgrades go, this version has added a very childlike interface, a dynamic crosshair that fails to reflect the time period that the game takes place in, and finally some new maps that seem more like CS maps than ever before. Sure, they added a few new textures, but the layout of the maps is still cramped to force the player to use strategies that would be used in the present day world of submachine guns and body armor, not those of old time WWII.If you want a WWII first person shooter, then go for Battlefield: 1942 or Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Don't waste your money on this Counter-Strike copy that uses the same outdated engine."
3,Save your Money and Buy Battlefield 2 instead,DOD on the HL1 engine was great. DOD Source on the HL2 engine is great. However I spent about 1 week playing it and this is my advise. Buy Battlefield 2 instead. BF2 is a much better war multiplayer. It is what everyone is playing at the moment instead of DOD:S.
2,Gets boring after so many hours,"Graphics are good, but over all, I enjoy Battlefield far better than this when it comes to WWII game. Unlike Battlefield, all you do is just shoot guns and shoot guns and shoot guns. That's it. There isn't much of tactics other than just get flags. No airplanes, tanks, ships, nothing. In Battlefield, you can ride so many different type of vehicles, anti-aircraft guns, stationally guns, get on different types of airplans, ships.. so much more than just shooting guns. Medal of Honor is similar to this, but again, Medal of Honor is far better. Medal of Honor has missions to complete. All you do on this game is just shoot each other and get flags.....that's it. You can just keep running until you find somebody who does not have name tag showing up as ""friendly"". When you throw a grenade, you can see on map, so not much of tactics for that.If you enjoy just shooting guns w/o much of tactics, this is the one for you. If you want more challenge, get some other games"
1,dont buy this game!,I thought this game would be fun I was rong.This game dos not beat MOHAA at all it is stupid!The kills stink they die the same way lotes of times if you are luckey you yill see a new one.But wast your money if you want to dont say I dident warn you.
1,ON-LINE ONLY!!!!!!,"I HAVE NEVER PURCAHSED A GAME THAT WAS LIMITED TO ON-LINE GAME PLAY. THIS REALLY HITS A LOW. SURE, I REALIZE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PLAY THESE GAMES BUT I AM NOT ONE OF THEM. WHY EVEN MAKE A GAME LIMITED TO MULTIPLAYER?ATTENTION BUYERS: PLEASE READ THE FINE PRINT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON GAMES YOU WON'T PLAY! I HAVE SPENT ALOT OF MONEY ON GAMES ONLY TO FIND OUT THEY ARE NOT WHAT IS REPRESENTED BY THE MANUFACTURER.*SHOULD HAVE READ THE FINE PRINT."
2,Not Worth 35$,"The game is like at least 7 years old and not worth 35$there are better games out there.the graphics are like cardboard-cut-outs especially the vehicles, tanks, trucks, buildings================================================================if you do buy the game....read on...Mods on the server named ""Pucker Factor"" on US east coast filter have banned me just because they dont like the way i play.then they lied and say i TK in spawn with grease gun, which i dont ever use because it shoots slow.and for lying i want to get them back with all of your help. I want people to go on there server and team kill relentlessly to *iss them offit is on US East filter named ""Pucker Factor"""
5,Very interesting book.,Well written biography about old Egypt.It was easy to read and it had a fantasic spiritual approach to life. I am glad my friend recommended it to me.
5,ancient egyptian mysticism,One of the first ancient readings I was introduced to. My original copy was tatered through use. This was my replacement copy. This was one of the publications that began my spiritual journey.
1,What a fairytale!,"This book was such a disappointment. It was recommended to me by a yoga teacher, and after reading all of the reviews on amazon.com I thought it would be great. The story of this woman's life is too unbelievable. I felt like I was reading a fiction, rather than an autobiography. Her life story is farfetched and ridiculous. I am sorry I wasted my money on this book. I would donate it to my local library, but I'm too embarassed!"
5,This book has had a profound and positive effect on my life.,"All things happen for a reason and it was no mistake that a virtual stranger passed this book on to me after a brief conversation. It marked a special place in my spiritual journey. I didn't read it as fiction because it felt like ""home"" to me, that in a previous existence, I had walked that path. The familiarity was unquestionable. I'm an artist and I created a painting entitled ""STEP INTO ETERNITY"" to honor that experience. I recently recommended this book to someone and was happy to see that Amazon could provide it. It's been 17 years since I received that gift and it's impression still stays strong with me. May those who are drawn to it be so inspired on their own journey."
5,Very meaningful,"I am struck that the others who reviewed this book also mention how long it has remained important to them. This is the single most important and enduring book in my life and that's saying a lot. At every stage in my life, I have found new guidance, support and understanding in its pages."
4,Great book to learn about Spanish culture,"This is a great book if you want to learn more about the Spanish culture, linguistics, communication and so on. It's an easy read and it's guaranteed that you'll learn a lot."
4,Virtually pain free introduction to German,"I purchased the 2 CD set (Speak German with Michel Thomas) to play in my car on the way to work, and found it easy to follow. Although I have little prior experience with German, I have many German clients, and Thomas' pronunciation and inflection seem very close to theirs. I found myself mastering the vocabulary he presented quickly (more quickly, in fact, than the two students on the CD). Thomas introduces sentence structure as an exercise in getting your point across rather than a grammar lesson. One caveat: The 2 CD course is a bit short on vocabulary, and introduces only about 60 German words or so. Go for the 8 CD set (German with Michel Thomas)."
2,Many drawbacks,"I found the pace to be extremely slow and Mr. Thomas' voice soporific. Another major drawback is that the student voices are not native speakers. There are a great many other slow paced courses, such as Living Language, which I think are far superior."
4,How DId I Become My Parent's Parent?,"This little book came at a time when I am experiencing my parent's rapid aging and decline, not knowing when to step in and when to let them take responsibility for their own decisions, and experiencing a myriad of feelings in that regard. For a small book of 203 pages, it covers a multitude of scenarios that include options on what to do and what not to do and also the pain and fulfillment that goes along with each decision. It tells how caring for your parents can not only be a burden, but a life strengthener with its own unexpected rewards."
3,"Workmanlike, uninspired","I've been reading a lot of bass fishing books lately and this one is mediocre, especially compared to the author's work on trolling. His book The Art of Trolling is excellent, especially if you're interested in downriggers."
2,Disappointing pen,"These pens start out wonderfully smooth, but they run out of ink very quickly, leading to skips. I especially wouldn't recommend buying 72 of them at once! If you've never used them, go buy one or two from the store and try them for a few weeks before you commit to buying the big package."
2,Disappointing,"This album catches the Waterboys trying to be what they are not (or, at least, have not been until this effort) -- derivative. Though the lyrics are adequate, the songwriting is subpar. This is exacerbated by, as another critic noted, the poor production and ""special"" effects. The result is a cluttered mess that isn't worth the struggle of dozens of listenings (at least not yet). This comes from a long time Waterboys and Mike Scott fan, who melted the plastic many years ago on singles like, ""Church not made with Hands,"" ""Spirit,"" ""When will we be Married?"", and ""Be my Enemy,"" and, more recent devotion to Scott's solo, Christian-centered, ""Bring 'em all In."""
2,What was Mike thinking?,"I'm a big, big, big Waterboys fan and I couldn't wait to get this cd after reading the glowing reviews...sorry folks, this cd is terrible, ok, maybe one song is ok. Why did he distort his voice on almost every single song? And when did he start to sound like Bob Dylan? Incredibly disappointing...I want my money back!"
3,There's a sameness about the recent Mike Scott works...,"I loved the early works and the Big Music sound. I loved the Spiddel House recordings. And Dream Harder wasn't half bad. But I've been disappointed with Scott's efforts over the past three CDs. So I was really looking forward to this one. However I was disappointed again. While it's marginally better than his solo works (although it's technically still just Mike Scott), the new one doesn't seem to have departed much from the formulas of the solo CDs. Lots of words (good lyrics, but many songs would benefit from editing IMHO) and nothing that really stood out save a couple of cuts (title cut, Still Concious). I miss Anto and Steve Wickham. Guess I'll have to be content with the live CD. Still better than most stuff out there, but I had hoped for better."
3,Only so so,"I can't help, but think that most of this rather short book should have just been part of the main book. Don't by this book if you're expecting stats for various weapons. (Some weapons have slightly different stats for good quality items, but that's it.) It does have a fairly large section on hiring various professions. I'd only buy this book if you have cash to spare, and your group likes the official word on how much to pay for goods, and services. Otherwise buy Bestiary, get the magic book, or buy Sigmar's Heirs."
3,Mostly More Of The Same,"This book has chapters on currency, trade, arms, armour, equipment, transport and hirelings. Most of the chapters are expansions on material from the core rulebook. In some cases rules from the core rulebook are published here again. While convenient it adds to the page count and takes up space that could be used for more new material.The chapter ""Currency & Trade"" was useful and interesting. The chapters on arms and armour were just more detailed descriptions of weapons fantasy RPG players already know and can read about in the core book.The production quality of the book is high but the number of typos in the book make it look like it was rushed to production (something that I didn't notice in the core rulebook).Overall, it should make a good reference for the gamemaster who wants a few more unique items in the game and some pregenerated nonplayer characters."
5,After many years...,"My children are now 11 and 14. When tasting honeycake, they instantly returned to detail and images of this lovely book. My oldest daughter remembers that ""even the shadows were long"", and the beautiful rainbows. My youngest daughter instantly recalled the playmates and their dolls...and the honeycake. Oh! And the colourful illustrations. We own many BH Berger books, they are part of the ""beloved don't give it away"" collection."
4,If only it had more velocity . . .,"Some of the preview scenes I saw for this looked very exciting. You command a spider-esque looking tank that can also go airborne. It has plenty of earth-shaking weapons to choose from, and there is a multitude of targets to destroy. Graphics are, for the most part, super. Land and seascapes are richly detailed, and there is plenty of special effects.So, why only four stars? Unfortunately, the game moves as a nearly constant pace, and it is a slow one at that. And, although there is a lot to shoot at, it isn't particularly engaging. But this is still a worthy game, and should fill up plenty of hours of your time.By the way, Aquila is Latin for ""eagle."""
3,Nothing new under the sun,Thought this would be information of which I was not aware. Pretty much a review of what I already knew.
4,I just wonder what all of this means ! Seriously !,"I am new to all of this. I was the biggest skeptic I ever knew about UFO's. But this movie - - the other UFO movies I have seen lately - - like ""Out of the Blue"", ""Phoenix Lights"" and ""UFO's: The Best Evidence"" have showed me things from credible people that I just shake my head and wonder ""What the heck is going on in the world."" And what really is interesting is our United States government's absolute obstruction in all of this classified info for the past 50-years or so now. I suppose if the truth were truly known, it would throw the world into a tailspin in terms of some of life's most sacred beliefs. I truly am wondering about all of this - - and wonder what it all means."
5,a must own !!,"i saw this on netflicks and i had to own it. wow u have to watch this documentary to believe it. CREDIABLE witnesses, true stories, and excellent computer animations to help explain the storys. every true story will keep u on the edge of your couch cushin. if u like watching documentaries on space, nature, science, archaelogy, etc..this is a must must own. stop reading this review and order it!! thanks james fox for your hard work!!!"
3,Compare I know what I saw/ with Out of the blue ufo dvd's,"I recently purchased these two dvd's. It was a mistake, they both have similar video content, buying one is close to a duplicate of the other. they both have James Fox, film director/narrator.So, I guess I'm stuck with both don't make the same error."
5,Unique!,"I grew up within spitting distance of one of these castles, the Marksburg on the Rhine. The series is fascinating because it fills the places with life, something you don't get to see when you visit. But it's not over the top and sappy. Many local areas experience a medieval revival these days and markets and plays are held at many of these locations throughout the year. So if you plan a visit, check out the schedules online and you might catch more than just the ruins and vistas but a lively show that sets you back a few hundred years. Even if you can't go there yourself, this is the next best thing. I am surprised that this series was never offered on DVD. The commentary is very good, you have to pay attention and you can learn a lot. I just wished there were more castles included in this series."
3,Great Castles of Europe,"The subject matter is as I expected & I don't regret the purchase. However, I found the 'soft focus' a bit trying & was disappointed in the relatively small number of castles featured. The delivery of the item was quite prompt, & the condition of the tapes very good."
2,I use Japanese websites instead,"Because I got this item for free, I like having it, but if I had paid $15 for it, I'd feel a little ripped off.It's handy for EX-Skills and sidequests, but there are too many things it doesn't do a good job of explaining. The walkthrough it gives you is perfectly linear even when the game isn't, so you have to follow it exactly or you may end up in a situation where its info doesn't help you. It doesn't cover character affection and how it changes the plot, except for one little vague, misleading, and useless paragraph.It really needed to be proofread too. There are places where text just cuts off in the middle of a paragraph and doesn't continue anywhere, or places where extra fragments of text appear out of place."
2,Another Mistake,"Once again Dan leaves us hanging. There is a lot of information that could be here(need I say maps?). Also a lot of poor paragraphs and directions leave you studying the pictures to find out whats next, not the text."
5,price per square foot included in this book,Beautiful book with much needed info..a real treat for the eyes..the best is it gives the cost of contruction for almost all the houses shown...if you want to build a strawbale than this book is one you will want to include in your library..does not give alot of hands on constrution but it does gives you visual ideas of what others have done with their houses..
2,Nice pictures,"This book had some good pictures of different SB structures. But, to me that is all there was."
2,lame paper wears out soo soo fast,"Maybe Ive been spoiled, but the roll I had before this was made by Klingspor and only costs a couple of dollars more. I tried to find it here but couldn't and needed some 150 quick. I still have some of the old Klingspor and when sanding raw baltic birch plywood and solid pine the Klingspor out lasts this stuff by at least 10 times. Not only that but even after it's started to wear out a little it's still way sharper and more effective than this stuff when fresh.jus' sayin'"
2,Wrong Coffee Maker,Somehow I received the 036-42 and should have received the 035-42......what can we do? This coffee maker will not engage the drip controller.....jody
1,NEVER got it!,I received a cancellation order due to the item being out of stock by Wayfair.The problem - it took 3 weeks and 3 days to get this info!My shower is still not working and I have to start all over again - major bummer!Why sell something you do not have?
1,I should have known better,"The first day that it came, the ball didn't stay aired up. The kids used another ball and then the bottom part would not stay aired up. Lesson learned."
2,Doesn't last long,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift. It lasted less than one day before it began to leak air. The net and stand part lasted longer before it began to lose air---almost three days! It is really too bad because if the quality were better, this would be a wonderful, fun item."
2,damaged in packaging!,"I got this for my sons birthday. When I opened it, it was brand new in the package. As I started to blow it up, I noticed that there was a hole in the seam! I used the inclosed patch to repair it and it would not hold. Its less sticky than 10 year old tape. I had to use fingernail polish, hair dryer and the rest of the patch to seal it. Hopefully this will hold. Its blow up and the kids just got home so we will see if it holds up."
3,Wonder Woman-The Early Years,"Wonder Woman Archives vol. 1 is the first instalment of a series of hardcover Wonder Woman collections from DC Comics. The Golden Age stories have their ups and downs. Good Points include respect for females, something most comicbooks of the time didn't have, and great artwork, possibly the best Golden Age art I've ever seen. The Bad Points are racism, mainly twoards Germans and Japanese, although the book has it's share of Blackface. Interesting, culturaly signifigant, and at times entertaining, Wonder Woman Archives vol. 1 is a worthy addtion to any Comicbook fan's library."
3,Fun but juvenile,"D.C. is doing a great thing releasing their archival editions of their most popular superhero comics. Was very happy to come across these earliest Wonder Woman, and indeed, it was a fun nostalgia trip. My only disappointment was that the stories were even more juvenile than I had expected. Would love to see D.C. skip ahead and do archive editions of the '70s Wonder Woman comics. The art reproduction and recoloring are truly fantastic."
4,"Wonder Woman Vol. 1, blast from the past",Picked up this one for my 7-year-old daughter. She loves it. The other reviews capture the quality of the product. Unexpected and earnest foreword by Judy Collins.
5,These are some of the coolest strories.,"This book is well worth the money. The stories are fun. The action is great. Wonder Woman is a true hero. The drawings aren't the greatest, but they all a great overall feeling to the book."
5,Must Reading!!!,"Haven't been to the Amazon Basin since the early 60s, so great to study how the area is developing, and how the indigenous population is advancing.. Plan to return soon and do some writing and photography..."
1,Simply Awful!,"Zero Stars - a waste of money.I couldn't get through the first 50 pages of this book as they were a constant re-hashing of the same material, endless meandering dialog,and contrived characters, especially the ""Lord of Fire"". A lot of it didnt' make sense either, within a page and half the ""Lord of Fire"" had risen from his seat twice! He had already risen once, so how he could have risen several paragrahs later, was beyond me. This story appears to be from a writer who had the ""idea in her head"" her warrior was a ""Lord of Fire"", yet he was not so on the page. Written by someone who must have been on coffee for a week, a book that seriously needs to be edited and/or the ""writer"" needs a different career."
5,Another Amazing Sermon,"Explains how Satan works in physical and religious realms today, and how God has given power to overcome him. Transcribed sermon Message by Bro. William Branham."
1,Demonology - Not,This book has nothing to do with demonology. It is a copy of a serman given by a minister which was tape rcorded & then transcribed into book form. I was very diapointed. I have a very High respect for almost any book even one's with religious content. However instead of trying to get a refund (which appears to be more trouble than its worth) I will just destroy it by fire so no-one has to read it.
3,Just OK,"I was very disappointed with this cookbook. I suppose the 1960's original publication should have tipped me off that this wouldn't be the place to look for authentic, exciting recipes. (Ethnic cooking in the U.S., at the time, wasn't known for being authentic or exciting.)Most recipies are simplified and/or changed for western tastes. There is a heavy emphasis on recipes imported by settlers from other countries (lots of Asian and a fair number of British dishes); dishes which, presumably, would be more familiar to American readers.There are far better African cookbooks available. (Don't know if it's still in print, but ""African News Cookbook"" is about the best I've seen so far.)"
3,No Desire for Desire Walks On.,Black On Black / Back To Avalon / Ring Them Bells / Will You Be There are the only four songs worth listening too. I heard this disc at a store when it first came out but didn't buy it until years late at a used Record / CD store. I Listened to a few clips and decided to buy it for the four songs listed above.Where did Howard Leese go after this album?The newer sound and new band members began to turn me off to their newer music.
5,Please Ring Them Bells,"This is a great album with plenty of amazing songs, but none are better than the cover of the Bob Dylan song ""Ring Them Bells""This song sees them collaborate with Alice in Chains lead singer Layne Staley, and together they make something truly wonderful. Wilson with her powerful voice full of passion and Staley with his powerful and haunting voice make this song alone worth buying the album.Layne Staley and Heart two very amazing yet very underated artists."
2,90s were mostly the end of my heart love,"Love the early stuff and know that bands evolve - both artitically and commercially, but still not my cup of tea, but they are good musicians."
4,"This one did walk on, didn't it?","I have one question, where is Black on Black I? ""Back to Avalon"" is their early days. ""In Walks the Night"", ""Will You Be There"", ""Anything Is Possible"", ""The Woman in Me"" are their best on this disc."
2,challenging to put together,did not snap together easily like stated. was a bit of a challenge to put together and was very frustrating
3,I'll just add to what's above,"Without knowing much on the subject, I will say that all the arguments in this book seem sound. However, it is written in such an incoherant manner - switching back and forth from century to century, that you often don't know what century the author is talking about, much less his current argument. Instead the book comes across as Basil rambling, and this has more to do with the above stated, ""being told much, but being told nothing."" You'd have to re-write every fact and place them all in cronological order to make any sense of it."
2,Different readings within seconds,"I was really happy with this scale at first. Then the readings begin changing on me within seconds. I stepped on and the scale would say one thing. Then it would change to a pound higher -- while I was still standing on it. Ten seconds later I would have an even higher reading. The readings stay within a pound of each other, but I never know what it really is. I'm planning on replacing it with another scale."
2,weight is not consistent,"If I weighed myself 5 times one after the other, I would get the same weight only 2 out of 5 times. I tried out a friend of mine's scale and it gave me the same reading every time. I'm already thinking of getting a different scale. On the brighter side, it was more accurate than the last one I had."
1,Very disappointed in this product,"I could never get a consistent, accurate reading on this digital scale. If I stood on it 3 times in a row, standing in the same place each time, and not move the scale, it gave 3 very different weights. Very disappointed in my purchase."
3,70's revenge mystery,"During a sorority initiation ceremony, something goes horribly wrong when one of the new members is accidentally killed. Seven years later, the remaining sisters receive invitations to attend a reunion at an isolated mountain estate. Little do they know, the resort is owned by the father of the deceased sorority member, and he is looking for revenge."
3,not as bad as reported,"i just saw the movie yesterday, and though it is true it's not as good as the first, i still liked it a lot. The music is also awesome. very catchy, but the song that toulour performs his laser dance to isn't on the CD, it's ""El Capitalismo Foraneo"" by the GoTan Project. but still, the music is really good."
4,Great,"I personally think 11 was better, but after watching the movie, i had the music stuck in my head and so now i am beginning to love it. I guess, the movie worked really well this music, hence, the music grows on you and you can't get it out of your head once you leave the theater.I also want to know the name of the song when the nightfox goes through the beams. It sounded very middle-eastern. I woulnd't be surprised if it were by a Morrocan singer like Cheb-Mami or Khaled. It could be Turkish too, since it is part of Europe. I dunno...??? Any help.....?????BTW, this is a MUST-SEE movie, i loved Julia Roberts role."
5,Song,"I also wanted to know what the name of the song from the dance in the laser beams, if anyone knows, it isn't on this soundtrack."
3,Thank you to D. Krcelic,I would like to thank Mr. D for giving the link to the site for the Nightfox scene. I bought the CD and was NOT happy to find the song I bought for missing. But I will say that the CD is pretty good.
4,i liked it but...,"the movie was great, and the soundtrack really fits it. but does anyone know the name of the song that is being played while the ""night fox"" thief is jumping through the beams? thanks!"
4,Great but could be improved,"First off, I love this soundtrack. The songs really made the scenes of the movie in which they were featured. There are, however, a few songs that they overlooked when compiling this soundtrack. The first track that I think should have been in this soundtrack is Amsterdam. It was made by David Holmes himself and it confuses me why it wasn't included in the first place. It has been added on iTunes on a two track single titled, Amsterdam/I Love Art...Really!. The second and most obvious song that was neglected is The a la Menthe by La Caution. The third missing song is Rito a Los Angeles by Giuseppe De Luca which was played during the scene where the egg is stolen on the train. This can also be purchased on iTunes. I found once I added these three songs, the soundtrack really felt complete."
4,The Real Story...,"I am wondering what the song was that actually played when Danny was telling about the actual theft of the item. There is a track labeled ""the real story"", but it is not the actual song used in the movie. Any ideas. Played when they fought in the train at the end of the movie while talking to the Nightfox..."
3,Laserdance would have made it better,"Many, many thanks to D. Krcelic for posting the link for the nightfox laserdance. I came to buy this soundtrack just for that song and I had to sample all the songs to find out it wasn't even on the album. I was kind of disappointed at first, but overjoyed when I found I could just download the song I wanted for free. Anyway, here's the link Krcelic posted just in case you can't find his post: http://www.kourtrajme.com/accueil.htmOn a side note, the track on that site didn't really seem complete so I edited it to make it sound more like a full song and more like the version from the movie; so my version now has the intro like the movie version and it's about 1 minute longer with a fade out at the end (instead of just an abrupt stop). I would share it with you guys, but unfortunately I have no place to host it. If anyone knows of any free file hosting sites you can post here and let me know."
3,The Other missing song off this soundtrack,"Many people already mentioned the 'Night Fox - Laser scene' by Nikkfurie de La Caution, which was not included on the Ocean's 12 soundtrack. (Thank you for those who found that song, that's why I found this link)In early reviews many people thought the above song was performed by Gotan Project, close - - but wrong scene. Gotan project's -""El Capitalismo Foraneo"" is used in the scene when 'Frank' is leaving the Nail Salon in Amsterdam. This track is also not included on Soundtrack. [...]"
3,Thank You!,"Thank you to all the people that posted information regarding ""The a la Menthe"" (aka laser song)! Loved the song and was extremely disappointed that it was not included in the soundtrack. Yet, now I have it, thanks to many of you..."
2,Music BAM!,"The nightfox laser dance song without question is a sample/remix/remake/ BAM from a part of the score from the 1979 Italian movie, The Concorde Affair. Just saw it on 3-8-07 and saw Ocean 12 like 2 weeks prior.No doubt it is the same thing only redone.Randy"
4,Song Not As Good As You Think,"The A La Menthe stunned many viewers due to the fact that it was paired with the NightFox entrance. Upon listening to the score alone, you'll realize my point. By no means is it average, it is in fact good... Just Not As Good As You Think"
4,hey replying to Andrew...,i found the song and wud luv to hear ur version too...god the nightfox laser song...is just amzing song...i want to go crazy with it...the rest of the soundtrack was great too just wish they had included the nightfox laser song too...oh well...use this host site: http://rapidshare.de/ send us the link plz!
3,the laserdance,"YAY, I found it, now if only it was a ringtone... I LOVE YOU GUYS thank you for helping me find it! I wanted it so bad. this CD is NOTHING without that song.... LA CAUTION ROCKS..and so does the song..."
4,The a la menthe,"I was very disappointed to find that The a la menthe by Nikkfurie was not on the soundtrack. Then I found the file but was dissapointed to find that it wasnt the full version and didnt really have a beginning or end. I read on another message board that someone edited it so it had a beginning and an end but couldnt post it because they didnt know of a free file hosting website. Well here is one...(...)If you can edit the song and post it there, please email me with a link!!! Thanks..."
3,hmmm,Bought it for the 1 beautiful song. The rest of the music is really bad... thank goodness I didn't hear it during the movie.
4,worth it,The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the CD arrived in a tight fit cardboard mailer with no jewel box (plastic CD case). Otherwise it plays just fine and there appears to be nothing wrong with it. I would buy a pre-owned CD from this business again since I now have additional jewel boxes.
2,Rip Off,"I didn't listen to the entire soundtrack but I do know that track #2 ""$165 Million + Interest (Into) The Round Up"" is actually a rip-off of a piece by the Fabulous Wailers, the popular Seattle rock band of the early sixties, called ""High Wall."" If you get a chance compare them. Hmmmm . . ."
2,Nightfox laser dance song,"I read other reviews in search of the best song of the movie but not on the soundtrack and I did some searching and found the CD but it's not on Amazon anymore although the page is still up, the name of the CD is ""Peines De Maures / Arc-En-Ciel Pour Daltoniens [IMPORT]""by La Caution. You can probably buy it on ebay or your local underground music store."
4,Great soundtrack,"David Holmes wrote some great music for the soundtrack, so it's worth getting - even without the ""Night Fox"" track everyone is looking for. (If you must have that you can actually purchase it from the iTunes store (why amazon doesn't have it? Who can tell.) Search for the track ""Thé à la Menthe"" by the group La Caution."
3,Ending Credits Song,"Some of you guys on here seem to be able to find music that's not on the soundtrack pretty well.What I am looking for......the music that plays for about a minute and begins in the scene where Catherine Zeta Jones signs form 1077 that shes not supposed to...and then it cuts to Matt Damon and Don Cheadle leaving the mock museum model...and then cuts to Catherine Zeta Jones talking with Vincent Cassel (Nightfox) about the stolen paintings.Also, the music resurfaces again during the ending credits.Any help?"
5,The Nightfox Laser Song (edited),"I have edited the ""A la menthe"" song so it has a beginning and end like the movie. I used the file sharing site Don't worry recommended. The link for it is: http://rapidshare.de/files/2175628/Nigthfox_Laser_Dance_Song.mp3.html"
2,"The ""Cover"" of Iron Butterfly","I noticed a couple of people asked about the ""cover"" of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Well, I watched the movie credits and there was no mention of the song. Obviously, they ripped it off and renamed it. Pretty digusting. Very blatant. It wasn't even a matter of a riff that sounded similar... They copied the sound and mood too, complete with Don Ingle-style organ. Sad."
5,good product,This was a very good purchase. We are putting up a fence around one acre and it has made digging the holes much easier.
5,Just what I needed,Love not having to expand the top of the hole to dig deep holes as with conventional diggers. Ample weight for letting gravity do the work of breaking through hard-packed dirt. Sturdy construction.
5,"Fred in Augusta, GA","Great hole Digger, It's heavy and duable even in clay. I'm glad I purchased it on line because buying it local would have caused double the price. Money well spent!"
1,Trash,"The tool bent on the second hole...first hole was sand, and the second, sticky clay.One side of the diggers bent and twisted...all steel construction? Wtf?In addition to poor quality, the diggers have a weak design. The pivot is too far from the blade tip...it's hard to close, and you don't get a full scoop.Complete trash, if you ask me."
4,Billy,"heavy duty diggers, quilty made steel diggers, we have dug many holes with these diggers , Diggers show very little wear. I will be buying more."
3,handle bends,the handle keeps bending. you can straighten it back out but it is annoying. it could use some reinforcment by the hinge
2,Not all it's hyped up to be,"According to most of the reviews of these posthole diggers, they are the best there is. The ad claims they are factory sharpened to make digging easy. Well, this is pretty far from the truth. The ones I received were pretty dull, the ends had about a 3mm rounded end, which didn't dig very well at all, so I sent them back. If they were as sharp as a shovel, they would probably work pretty good."
4,POST,"THIS SEAM TO BE A GREAT ITEM TO OWN, THE FIRST TIME I USED A POST HOLD DIGGER THAT DID BRING MY KUCKERS TOGETHER DIGGING HOLE HAS GOT BETTER"
4,Does the job - but beware the packaging!,"This is a great, sturdy posthole digger. However, I think next time, I'd buy something like this from my neighborhood hardware store: it came in a box the size of a bike box and had about a half a mile of butcher paper around it. It took a couple of weeks for the recycling guys to haul all the packaging waste off!"
5,Fiskars 9653,"My Fiskars 9653 Post Hole Digger was delivered faster than expected and it was put to use right away. Although this was my first Post Hole Digger, the tool is easy to use and my task was finished quickly. Good weight - heavy enough to dig into virgin sub-soil but not too heavy to pull it out with a full load. Smooth hinge action. Blades close tightly. Although Fiskars 9653 blades' edges are tapered to improve their bite, I found that a much sharper thinner straight trenching shovel is helpful when cutting through tree roots larger than 1"" diameter. All things considered, Fiskars 9653 Post Hole Digger is a fine addition to my tool set."
5,these thigs get the job done,"I figured i would try these things out before i went and bought a $600 3pt tractor auger. I planeted 15 3-4' deep holes in 2 days. If you add in the amount of time i would have been changing shear bolts on an auger these things even saved time. They cut though most rocks and with the help of a digging bar i had no problems. These are a must have, esp for the price."
5,Wow...Best Digger,"This is a product where you ask yourself ""Why did I not have this years ago?"". I have busted knuckles countless times with the standard diggers over the years and then I find this....wow. It may be a few dollars more than cushy handled old style one, but well worth the extra dollars. Heavy construction...no wood to flex...and gets down a lot deeper due to the design. Great product."
5,Worth every penny,By far the best post hole digger I have ever used. Almost effortless down to three feet. Steel handles mean no splinters and the offset handles do away with bashing my knuckles..
3,Too Heavy - okay design,"Fiskars 9653 post hold digger - If you really need extra handle strength (rocks etc.) then maybe these are good since they are made completely out of metal tubes. I found them to be way too heavy for normal post hole digging. I could dig twice as much with a fiberglass handled pair of post hole diggers, simply because of the lower weight allowing faster movements and requiring fewer breaks for my arms to rest. The orange handle covers came off frequently, you should plan on having to glue them on. Fiskars design only allows maybe 1 foot deeper than standard. If you really want deep, look at a hand held auger design instead."
5,what a great tool!,"One, this is an all metal tool. Great for the kind of ground I live on. Lots of rocks and it's tough to dig in. This tool is great for making short work in this kind of dirt. Being all metal, it won't break, chip or bend in the hole when it encounters a hard surface. Fiskars makes a great tool. Shipping got it here quick, unwrapped it and put it to use. This is a great tool. Well worth the extra price. Should last a long time."
3,Not too good,"Hard to read, switches mode as it bumps against your hip. I bought it but don't use it anymore. Definetly not worth the money."
2,Box accessories not clearly specified,"I purchased this phone from Amazon and I was hoping that standard accessories like ear phones, USB cable, Software DC would be included in the box, only after receiving the phone I got to know that it contains only the battery and ther charger and nothing else. I would like that all the accesories included in the box should be mentioned on the site."
2,MAIN FEATURES DISABLED!!,"i recently bought an unlocked V3x from chicago. When i came back to san francisco, i put my sim card in (cingular) and it SEEMED to work fine. It was all great until i tried out the web browser. It kept saying ""Network NOt Available"" so i called up cingular and asked them why it wasnt working. THey said its not a phone that is made with cingular yet so it doesnt have the browser. HE TEN TOLD ME SINCE IT DOESNT HAVE A BROWSER, THE 3G VIDEO CALLING, PICTURE MESSAGING, AND A LOT OF THE MAIN FEATURES ARE NOT GOING TO WORK. I WASTED 400 DOLLARS ON THIS AND THE MAIN FEATURES ARE DISABLED!! MY SUGGESTION IS THIS: BUY IT IF U CAN STILL RETURN IT JUST TO SEE IF U CAN GET IT TO WORK....BUT IF U CANT RETURN IT I WOULD SUGGEST NOT BUYING IT AND JUST WAITING UNTIL IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT IN THE U.S."
1,NOT 300 Wipes,"Very disappointed, I bought this because the advertisement claims it is 300 wipes. It is actually 75 wipes, 25 of each, so I grossly overpaid. I could have gotten this same deal for $10.00 locally."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I rented this book from the library, luckily. I read the first 20 pages (at the most) and got tired of it. I think I learned more about Christianity's god in those 20 pages than I did about runes. About half of what *is* written in this book is composed of the 3 introductions, quotes, in-work citations, and poems from about 50 different cultures that have nothing to do with runes. The whole idea of 'healing runes' in Blum's sense seems farfetched... It really sounds like he just pulled everything in this book out of nowhere so he could make some money... In his writing, he makes the excuse that there are people in rehab, people who are depressed but don't want to go to therapy, blablabla.... Which is supposedly why he and the other people wrote this book. My opinion is that if he wanted to change the meaning of the runes, he should have just made his own system of divination instead of ruining one that already exists."
4,"Great introduction to runes, a ""must have"" to help heal","This book was my first introduction to Runes. It is an easy read, beginning with good history of the Runes and continuing with thoughtful, applicable information about each stone. The focus is on healing, which doesn't apply to my life right now (thankfully), but this will be my first reference tool when I next enter a state of healing! This book was a great introduction for me and my family."
5,The Healing Runes by Ralph Blum,"Having utilized Mr. Blum's Book of Runes for quite some time, I was delighted to discover this companion book. I find each time I pull a rune that it tells me just what I need to know and feel the truth and consistency in his interpretations. Now I can pull one rune to both give me the information I need for the day plus provide a healing message. Very insightful."
5,Great product,"My son is very spiritually inclined, and he commented that he felt the power of the rune stones when he opened the package.It has helped him with his spiritual quest, and is a great tool to use.I also got another one as a gift for my daughter because of his comments.Thank you, you have a satisfied customer here. ~EM Williams"
3,nice addition,"if you have the actual rune book this is a nice addition especially if you happen to read for clients as i do/have. thats mostly why i bought it. its not the ""real"" rune book though and shouldnt be confused with the original book and descriptions that come with runes the ones i have used for ages. during this era alot fo ppl were into ""healing"" via the 12-step programs and i know thats why this book was presented, as i mention, its a nice addition... for a while."
1,A big disappointment,"Its allright to make up ones own systems, but at least make it clear for the reader. The book is ok written, but it has nothing to do with the Norse system.....Hail!"
1,A poor choice...,"I would not recommend any book on this subject written by Ralph Blunn. He knows very little about the subject, as evidenced by his book 'The Book of Runes' (See my review of this book under 10th Anniversary Edition for more specific information). He has rearranged the futhark (the proper name for the 'Viking runes') to suit his marketing scheme, and has no respect for this ancient tradition. Do not buy this or any of his other books on futhark. A simple online search will give you better information without extracting $20.00 from your wallet."
5,Wilderness Medicine,"As an RN,Trauma Nurse Specialist, I found this book to be well written and highly informative. With the speed of modern travel it's also a great reference to have for injuries and illnesses that can occur in far away places that one doesn't see often, or ever in your ""home"" ED."
2,Product Damaged - apparently do not order this from Amazon.,"The sticker is 36 inches, and the box I received it in was 36 inches. I was excited because this meant they didn't roll or crease the sticker. WRONG. They folded it half way up the sticker, leaving a nice crease in the vinyl letters.Order at your own risk - I'm returning it and not taking a chance on a replacement."
4,Great,"The only problem I have with this sticker is the points on the Yamaha tuning forks. The tips are cut very thin so they have peeled off and torn. However, I used this for the lid of my laptop, so on the back of a car/helmet/window, you shouldn't have that problem. A little expensive, but alright."
3,TIDBITS FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD,"Lana, the story of the ravishing blonde actress who reigned as queen of MGM studio, is another reminder that fame, fortune, and beauty can't buy happiness. In fact, sadly for La Turner, sometimes it is just the opposite.Jane Ellen Wayne, the author of bios of other screen luminaires packs her book with data, not much of which is new but its neatly compiled in these pages.Cosseted and marketed by Louis B. Mayer, the dictator-paterfamilias of MGM, Lana, according to this author, was ill equipped to recognize reality. Celluloid was her milieu; that was where she worked and tried to live.The history of her screen roles is well known to fans as well as the many romances with her leading men. Her personal life took a toll: murder, seven mis-marriages and seven wrenching divorces left her with little else but her reflection on the screen."
2,Beethoven is Beethoven and this is too loud.,"As is usual with the modern interpretations of Beethoven's music, this has one volume - too loud. There is a definite lack of subtlety in this recording so only if you are in love with the way odd numbered symphonies are recorded post Bernstein, you'll like this. Otherwise, steer clear,"
4,WHATEVER,anyone who writes a review for this game and rates it below a 4 star rating shouldn't be writing a review at all. That said this is one of the best games I have ever played in this genre.It's got that perfect mix of realism and fun to make a relly great game. pick it up...it's long enough to be a purchase not a rental. and one of the best things about this game are it's controls. They're very inovative. take your time in the tutoral and listen to all the instructions...if you don't that game will be very difficult indeed.
1,Big disappointment...,"After waiting for the game to become available, I find it to be a big disapointment. The game lacks the availability for beginner players to become proficient, especially since the controller mannipulation almost requires three hands (very cumbersome, and I'm a real pilot). When the action starts, it requires one to (as I have stated) be a pro at flying your aircraft or you're done for. There is a training phase at the beginning of the game, but this is done using a biplane. I could also never get the camera to work properly, so I contacted Ubisoft about my difficulties. They blew me off, suggesting I visit other sites explaining any hints with the camera. Unless you want to deal with utter frustration, and arthritis down the road, leave this game alone! I'll be selling mine on Ebay..."
4,"great game, few levels are hard","its a great game. great planes and graphics, but a couple levels are hard"
1,a total waste of money,"This game is a complete and total waste. It has lead to my decision to never again even look at another game by ubisoft. I thought Pacific Fighters was pitiful, but this is rediculous. The game is going in the circular file."
4,Really useful good quality item.,"Purchased this for a trip to Oregon and haven't regretted it. Survived 4k miles of abuse and even held on when we drove through a tornado like wind storm in Iowa!. One of the bungees with the plastic ball on the end ended up snapping, but this was due to abuse and not a fault in the product."
4,Sublime,"This is a poignant and amusing story of people dealing with sadness and loneliness. I know some people can't get into the characters, but for me the relationship Macon Leary has with his siblings is one of the best things about the book. The way they cared for each other and watched out for each other even when they were younger, was touching. There are tough times in everyone's life, some tougher than others. This book shows that it's easier to hang on when you don't close youself up to others and look for new avenues to move forward. This is an outstanding story."
5,The Book That Wrote Itself,"I hesitate to give this book a ten, at first, only because I do not believe in absolutes... there must be some book of surpassing greatness... and it will probably be this author's next work. Tyler is a writer of enormous skill. Her books seemingly write themselves, with characters that live so entirely in a world so simply evoked that from the first line-- no joke-- you are hynotized. The Accidental Tourist is Tyler's tour de force about a man who, forgive me, hates to tour. Macon Leary, as his name suggests, is not entirely comfortable with his surroundings: home, himself, his work. And for heartrending, sometimes hysterical, reasons. Living in Baltimore, suddenly without a family or routine, he falls apart and in doing so releases himself to forces that slowly allow him to see that it is not love, necessarily, but who we are with another person, that determines what kind of life we lead."
4,"A funny, well written book.","The Accidental Tourist is my favorite of Anne Tyler's booksbecause it is the funniest book. Unfortunately, the humorwas lost in the journey to the screen. Read the book."
5,How to Explain?,"I have never read anything which so effectively spoke to me (at the same time) of the beauty and loneliness of life.Somewhere on this earth right now, lives a person (Anne Tyler) who possesses an amazing ability to see/sense/perceive an extraordinary range of the human experience.A million people could look at the same thing and not really know what it means. But Anne Tyler might understand.Such breadth of awareness."
5,Brilliant Writer,"What a wonderful book. Thank you Anne Tyler for creating such unforgettable characters and filling this book with wit, creativity and enormous heart. I just absolutely loved it."
5,Wish it never ended,"I generally read spy thrillers or crime novels, so the lack of action in this book could have made it not my cup of tea. However, the clever ways that A.T. depicted small universes of human feeling captured me. For example, when the dog is a problem and his brother suggests getting rid of it, Malcom has a flashback of his son (now deceased) playing with the dog, and dismisses the suggestion. The dog is a part of his son that lives on. I hesitate to read more or A.T, because the story won't be the same."
2,I Wanted to Like It...,"I read this for a book club. I very much wanted to like the book, but within the first few pages was burdened by informative dialogue and a protagonist whom by his very nature didn't want to go anywhere. Inevitably, the plot really doesn't go anywhere either, and I can believe it when the author states that she created only a one page narrative outline before writing the book. At the end, we're stuck with characters we don't really care about and a contrived ending that has no real lasting impact. I don't mean to sound harsh, but the banality was just too much for me."
1,Boring book about boring people,I realy don't know what it is about this book that would make anyone want to make a movie about it. It was boring start to finish. It was very hard to care about any of the people or the dog.
1,This book is devoid of anything that can be described as art,"I have tried to stick with this story.........we have a paperback copy that we ran across in the process of going through some old boxes and I picked it up and started to read..........it may be that something in the narrative will produce, at some point, a compelling, engaging and involving story but I am one third through this and can't turn another page. My biggest problem with ""The Accidental Tourist"" (and it is a BIG problem) is that the narrative is boring...there is no ART in the way words and sentences are constructed and that, combined with a story line that is thin, have, for me, produced a non-page-turner. I think it is unfortunate that this work received some good reviews...what has happened to our standards."
3,review,haven't read it yet but looks good and would recommend it if you have time and would love a great mystery.
3,A pleasant diversion,"A more than pleasant diversionLightweight but with depthI needed something while travelling and this was just right. It wasn't challenging but it was engrossing. The story flowed convincingly and the characters were well constructed and their actions believable. The eccentricities of the family and the foibles of Muriel (and Edward, the dog) are wryly amusing and the combined quirkiness of all the characters drew you in to their benighted lives.Touching, funny ... just a good old fashioned nice read ... lightweight enough to disappear into but well written enough to hold you captive (even if I wasn't fussed about the ending)!Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1985"
4,"A Bit Rambling, But Quite Funny","Tyler's Accidental Tourist is a very nice and quick read. While following the escapades of Macon Leary, the hero of our story, the author teaches a gentle lesson about adult interpersonal relationships--the quote is as follows:""...he began to believe that people could, in fact, be used up--could use each other up, could be of no further help to each other and maybe even do harm to each other. He began to think that who you are when you're with somebody may matter more than whether you love her.""The book is a little too long, although nicely and thoughtfully written. The sentence structure varies nicely, and her characters are quirky, believable, and scarily like everyone's goofy side of the family. I did find myself chuckling out loud at a few of Macon's foibles and eccentricities; and that made this not only a thoughtful but a downright pleasant read as well."
5,Macon Leary - The Accidental Tourist,"I thought ""The Accidental Tourist"" was the best book I have read in a very long time, I absolutely loved it! By the end of the second chapter, I was drawn to this book! I could not put it down.Macon Leary isn't a man that had everything going for him, he divorced his wife, his son was killed a year before that, and he had many trust issues. Macon had trouble showing emotion, and second-guessed any emotion that people showed him.After Macon met Muriel, the dog trainer, his life changed, but it wasn't an overnight thing! Muriel tried for a very long time to convince Macon that they needed eachother.Macon and Muriel ended up together, which I was very happy about! They did need eachother, and he knew finally figured it out!!I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read! Like The Washington Post says on the front of the book, it's ""incandescent, heartbreaking, exhilarating...One cannot reasonably expect fiction to be much better than this."""
4,The Accidental Reader...,"I'll be honest, I only found this book because it was listed in the 100 Kindle Books at 3.99 or less last month. I'm so glad I saw it!Never seen the movie but I loved the novel. The characters were all quirky (right down to the dog), and I enjoyed the author's sense of humor. A great, quick read."
1,Characters are boring. not enough plot,"I was getting fed up with the book, noting that I was halfway through it and nothing had happened. The main character is boring and much too much time is spent on proving how boring he is. The other characters (except Muriel) were not very interesting either. The relationship beteen Macon and Muriel is simply not believable, based on their personalites.So much more could have been done with the plot. I expect the movie would have accomplished this or it would never have been made into one.For those who have said that the characters are quirky, I suggest that you check out books by William Deverell (eg. April Fool), where the characters are considerably more unique.Of the 7 books I read during my holiday, I rate The Accidental Tourist at the bottom of the barrel."
3,None,"The book is a little slow to start, but about a third of the way in you start to appreciate the character development. However the characters feel a little unreal and the plot is a bit lackluster."
4,Life is always an unfinished activity,"The book speaks to that lonely place inside of us that no matter how many persons we have around or how many activities me immerse ourselves into, always remains in a vacuum. But that does not mean that we are empty and unable to contact other persons no matter how weird they might seem. Is just that once we realize that no one has a calling to become our missing part of the puzzle, any quest in life somehow becomes more easy. Read it if you a want some balsam for those moments in which what you do feels sort of useless."
3,Fairly good story,"I've never listened to a book on tape before, and only did so with this book because I needed something to listen to at work. The narrator did a pretty good job, though his voice reminded me of a grandfather, not a 40-something guy. As for the story, I liked the fact that you never really knew what was going to happen next. I couldn't figure out what Macon was going to do, where he was going to go, and ultimately, which woman he was going to choose to be with. The relationships presented in the story, most of them troubled and/or messed up in some way, were rather fascinating. Overall, a farily good read...or listen."
5,I finally understood what life and true love really were.,"Read the book. I did when I was 14.It has influenced me for over 30 years. I have lived by many of Nancy's (and her father's) values.I will never ever regret spending my hard-earned pennies to get that book in some souvenir shop while my family was on our ""go West"" summer trip. I always thought long and hard before buying anything, but after leafing through a few pages and reading passages from Bess Streeter Aldrich's book, I would have asked my parents for extra money to buy the book. Luckily, I had enough.It's the best investment I have ever made.Karen K. (Schmidt) Gregory"
5,A great book for people who want to bring change,"This is a superb book for those who want to take active steps to bring change in their community. However large or small the change you wish to effect, this book guides you through the process - motivation, team-building, strategy, and much more. Very practical. Highly recommended."
4,It was like new,"I liked the fact that it wasn't used at all. There were no makings, highlighted areas or dents on it."
2,Neither interesting nor beautifully written---why bother?,"Has success spoiled J.Winterson? Her first 3 books were not only beautifully crafted, but ""Sexing the Cherry"" and ""Passion"" created delicious fantasy worlds--these books made you want to have Winterson over to dinner. ""Art and Lies"" makes me want to send her to writer's camp, or better, to some better world where she can recapture her sense of wonder. I will still buy her books, hoping she can seize the magic once more."
4,Inspiring philosophical meditation,"""There's no such thing as autobiography, there's only art and lies,"" Winterson reports in this philosophical narrative which intertwines three lives. The surgeon Handel is running away from the mistake he made on the operating table. Self-named Picasso is a painter whose life has been constricted and nearly destroyed by her family, until her current escape. Sappho has wandered the ages following her poetry and reflecting on her loves and on how the world omits parts of her life. These stories, along with a fourth that is about a prostitute looking for her lover, cohere in Winterson's sparkling language and form a mosaic that explores art and love, living and sexuality, identity and consequences. ""Art & Lies"" defies the structure of storytelling and instead vividly illustrates the human condition. I didn't feel that the ending brought the narrative to any sort of completion, but overall I found the book inspiring on several levels."
5,.........................................,"Art and Lies is in my humble opinion the best work of fiction (or is it?) I have ever read. It's dense, profoundly intertextual, and at times absolutely poetic. Please don't be fooled by Publius' obviously misguided review (for example, the comparison between Sophokles and Sappho is flawed from the start, and one might consider reading a bit about the historical reception of Sappho's work before making such bold statements); if Winterson will enter literary history as a footnote to a footnote, it will be one that disrupts the entire textual frame itself."
1,"Avoid...save your time, save your money","Nearly ten years ago Jeanette Winterson wrote a brilliant book-""The Passion"". Ever since, she's completely lost the plot. Is the language beautiful? Yes, but after you've read her other books it fails to dazzle as much. This one is about 3 nameless characters on a train, running away from their miserable existences and you'll probably need to read it twice to figure out what the whole thing's about. Basically i think she's trying to say : The modern world is rubbish, and art (supposedly this book counts) ought to rule. All very tiresome, a bit naive, and exceedingly pretentious. Go read something by Calvino, Kundera or Marquez instead .Whatever you do, don't buy this one. If you must, borrow it from the library."
3,Complicated calculating musings,"Two of Jeannette Winterson's books have changed my life. I am absolutely moved to tears when I read ""The Passion"" or ""Written on the Body"". While ""Art and Lies"" (great title) isn't a horror, I didn't really like it. It was a highly clever, very cerebral book, but if felt cold and iconoclastic to me. It had some very good musings though, and she is such a skillful writer that I'll try and read this book again (not any time soon though) and see if I just didn't ""get it""."
4,A Cautionary Note,"I'm a big fan of Winterson's, and would give ""The Passion"" and ""Sexing the Cherry"" high marks. I see ""Art & Lies"" as part of Winterson's continual progression toward a narrative that is less rooted in the concrete and more expressive of the sensual and the spiritual. In painterly terms, she's moving from realism to something between impressionism and surrealism. But where I find the two earlier works enchanting, I find ""Art & Lies"" a bit too impenetrable for its own good. The language in-and-of itself is often marvelous; perhaps a simple western mind like mine needs a little more narrative to guide it along"
4,I love Jeanette Winterson,"Almost anything this woman writes is good, great, wonderful. It's more like a walk through a forest of word-trees than reading a novel. The words and ideas drip tantalizingly from the branches but you mustn't stop to pick them as there are more, so many more. Best to start with Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit and The Passion and work your way forward. Be prepared to lose your way, but Winterson will always deliver you at the edge of the forest, none the worse for wear, but changed."
2,My guinea pig hates it =(,"I was hoping this would be a treat for my piggie but he absolutely hates these yogurt chips. Not only that he doesn't touch it but if I put it with the rest of his food he doesn't touch it either, and he's usually really fat and hungry.These chips have a very processed smell, maybe that's what keeps him in bad term with these yogurt chips, especially because as you know piggies have a really sharp sense of smell. I checked the expiration on the package and it's 2013, so this is not the cause of the smell.In anycase I just wanted to say that this product didn't work for my guinea, but it doesn't mean it wont work for others."
2,Not the best...,"I think there are better quality yogurt chips out there (Vitakraft) I know it isn't really healthy snack for bunnies, but this is like my secret weapon to befriend with new bunny...This one has partially hydrogenated soybean oil, palm oil... just too much extra stuff :( And I'm not sure if my bunny actually needs all these vitamins and minerals (iron, chloride, vitamin A, B12, E.....) So I try not to give this to my bun... I might get infant's yogurt chips instead in the future."
1,Not even credible...,"I'm sorry for the people who has invested money to buy this book, really. I love thillers and I love Algeria and have been there three times for quite a long stay (average 25 days) and this book has managed to leave me cold and indiferent.Algerian people are really nice and loyal friends, that I agree with but Touaregs live their life in the far South and they would never go to Algiers to play war of guerrilla. And there is something more: with the settlement of the nomad tribes came the Islamization, yes. But Touaregs have been traditionally animists and their traditions are very different from what is pictured here.In the terrible years of the terror war there is no way they would make an alliance with GIA to go up North in a massive manner (25!!) and there is something else: you will not find a Touareg dress with the cheche (turbant) in Algiers!!. Simply there is not need for it."
1,Good bar band,"I like another description I read of this as jam band light. The have a simple pop sound and feel like your average bar band. Not much else going on here, sorry to say."
1,Boring and uninspiring,"I received this cd as a gift from my girlfriend and was unimpressed. If you're a fan of Strangefolk you'll like this cd. It sounds just like any other cd Reid and the boys could have put together (Simplistic and poppy sounding). Having graduated from UVM these guys were everywhere in the Burlington area. Now with Reid gone SF & AOD are two ""different"" bands. But not really. If you like catchy sing-along music here is your cd. If you are looking for something with more depth not to mention diversity of style look elsewhere."
2,Just Okay,"This book was okay, not one of my favorites, but I'm a sucker for romance. I agree with some of the other reviewers, Taleah can get on your nerves after a while. Loved Lorenzo's character. I got through this book which says something, because if a book is too corny or just plain stupid, I will put it down. It serves it's purpose, giving readers a light-hearted love story."
2,too long,I just didn't like it. Taleah was just too corny for me.She was always questioning or crying about something. Itjust got on my nerves.
3,"Weird, even for Batman","Maybe it is just my lack of ability as a reader, but Harvest Breed was hard to follow and understand. It was rather strange and hard to identify with. Batman investigates grisly murders that end up having a supernatural element involved.Overall I don't regret getting it but long story short, I think there are better Batman graphic novels out there, like ""The Long Halloween,"" ""No Man's Land,"" and ""Knightfall."""
3,Excellent Art - Medicore Story,"Batman: Harvest Breed is the newest in a long line of hardbound Batman released comics. There is much to praise about this most recent graphic novel, yet, there is also a sense of disappointment. Pratt has used brilliant colors and sketching to delve into the Batman mythos. The story is, however, week and not extremely well developed.There are times this story brings about tension between Batman and Gordon that is interesting. But, they have had tension in their relationships before and it is unbelievable that this crisis would pose any threat to their strong friendship...All in all, if you are a true ""hardbound"" collector, then this book is a must..."
2,warning about size of product,"I ordered this product, needing a wall mount for a 40"" tv. It is advertised as holding a 26"" to 42"" display... so I ordered and received product # VM-140.when I opened the box and looked at the product packaging... it says it is a VN-140 BUT on the outside of the box where it has product description... there is a sticker OVER the part where it says what size displays it will handle.... and it says ""23- 27"".... I was like WTH???? so I measure the product INSIDE of the box marked VM-140.... and it is 19 3/8 inches long ...instead of 21"" long as described.SO be aware that there are some changes being made here."
5,A Taste of the Golden Age in these Modern Times,"I am not the biggest fan of John Byrne, because of his casual lack of modern continuity and numerous other reasons, but when he is at the top of his form I really love his work. In Generations, Byrne asks the question, ""What if the first meeting Superman and Batman really did take place in 1939 and they both character aged in real time?"" As the story infolds, Byrne separates the issues into two chapters with each chapter set in a specific decade and the story styled to that decades comic style (i.e. the campiness of the 50s, the dark 80s). What starts off being a story about two men slowly becomes a story about generations that circles back to the story of two men again. I recommend this to anyone looking for a nostaglic look at good storytelling and any John Byrne fan, because this is his best work in years."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","Despite having an excellent premise, this series fell flat due to the poor exectution by John Byrne. Is it just me, or does his current lackluster style of art show how lazy he's become? His original Superman work is far superior in quality of both story and art. This series had many good concepts but Byrne's corny dialogue, poor character design, and hokey storylines within the series left it feeling a bit too ""cutesy"" and childish. However, there are some fun moments but they aren't enough to outweigh the glaring flaws in this book. however, the series was well-recieved so you be the judge."
2,Strange,"Pretty good job conjuring the feel for the comics of each era, but overall disappointing. I found the ending a bit weird and depressing (""Oh, well, everyone's dead but we're OK, ha ha."") Not without interest, but veers all over the place. And, like I said, depressing."
3,A Good Idea Squandered On Bad Art and Campy Writing,"Superman & Batman: Generations, An Imaginary Tale is a good idea for a story: ""What if Superman and Batman aged in real time as the decades pass. What would there lives be like?""I thought the story was decent but the artwork reminded me of Sunday newspaper comic strips. The writing was very campy. Example: Batman calling Robin ""Old Chum""?? I thought I was watching the '60's TV series.Another flaw in the story: You are constantly teased by repeated appearances of Bruce Wayne's wife whose face remains hidden. You never get to know who she is in the story.If you're a die hard fan of Supes and Bats, you'll like this story. I'm used to reading and enjoying the ""Superman/Batman"" series (top notch artwork and great writing) so this book was a let down for me."
1,The world's finest at their lowest,"We all know that Superman is the ultimate boy scout, but in this story it's just too much. After all the man of steel goes through here, you'd expect he'd throw the villian into the sun, but no... the story is so insipid that... sorry I can't keep writing about this."
2,Quite Boring,"When I saw this Batman & Superman combination, from John Byrne no less, I was excited to pick it up. Boy was I disappointed. The concept is intruiging and the whole premise attempts to humanize superheroes but I found the whole story boring and quite uninteresting. It was almost half over before I began to more than bored but then the whole thing was unbelieveable (I know it's only a comic) and the end was really weak. The whole thing would have been better if it had been told in an epic format and been a little darker. I noticed a sequel is coming out but based on this story I recommend avoiding it altogether!"
1,This is the biggest stinker of all time,"In 20 years of comics reading, I have yet to encounter a more pathetic story. Byrne's previously respected talent was deep-sixed by this atrocity.In many ways, this book reminds me of Titanic, Armageddon or Pearl Harbor. Draw in the crowds with an action-packed trailer and big names, and then gas them with sappy, drawn-out love stories and crossover explanations that a four year-old could have given more depth.I truly feel that an important chunk of my life was soiled by reading this poo, and only hope this review helps redeem me by forewarning a possible hapless victim.(I wish negative stars were possible, as 1 star doesn't begin to represent my feelings about this book.)"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A fun romp through the generations : a look at some what ifs, if the Kent and Wayne families were more closely linked.The Bat-Mite Mxyzptlk team up is a classic. A lot of fun. Very nice work by Byrne here. This is very much in the vein of the Impossible Man stories, at Marvel, or Fantastic Four type work that Byrne put together on that run."
2,Disappointing execution of a wonderful idea.,"This is a wonderful idea: what if Superman and Batman's careers had begun in the late 30s, when they first appeared, and they'd remained active ever since, eventually getting married, having children, etc. Sadly, it doesn't come off well in execution. The story is disjointed and often disconcertingly grisly, the art perfunctory and phoned-in (it's not a patch on Byrne's lovely work on BATMAN/CAPTAIN AMERICA, which exists in the same world), and overall it never achieves the poignancy or strength of DC's own Earth-Two stories of years ago. Too bad."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!!!,"How AWFUL!!! Why did Francine Pascal and Kate William have to stoop so low??!?! The plot is stupid and predictable - I mean VAMPIRES?!?! And why does it have to be poor old Amy's cousin that looks just like Jessica and Liz (not forgetting the whole of Sweet Valley) - have to get offed?!!? Isn't it funny that Amy's cut up for about 2 seconds, then in the next couple of books she won't even have heard of her dead cousin - same as she's forgotten her half sister Ashley (in the SVT book!)"
4,Fun book,I am a beginner so I found this book to be lots of fun. I've worked with huge knitting needles before and thought it would be fun to crochet with the huge hooks too. The pictures were helpful and the color contrast made them easy to understand. A good beginner book.
4,Enjoyable,I mainly purchased this book for information on crocheting rugs out of fabric with a big hook. While I did enjoy the book I did find it a little lacking in detail in the rug chapter.
4,fun,"Love to crochet,have the knitting book also. Can get your creative juices flowing.Would suggest to anyone that likes unusual ideas!"
3,Great book for big hooks,This is a great book for those who want to learn how to crochet with big hooks. Would definitely recommend it.
2,Meh,"I wish I had looked at this book in a store. I expected more patterns or at least ideas. There isn't that much to this book, and what there is wasn't of much interest to me."
4,Buy it for the title track!,"Sweet film. My kids loved it, my 5 year old hasn't stopped talking about the baboon's pink bottom 2 weeks and counting after!But for all u music fiends and especially all u Paul Simon fans. Buy this DVD for the title track, which is performed end to end by the MAN himself, as an extra on the DVD.A stunningly simple and yet so brilliant Paul Simon tune about a father's love for his daughter, that I am now single mindedly practicing on the guitar, to be able to sing to my lil girl on Christmas Eve!Enjoy!"
4,Funny Stuff,It is a really funny relaxing produce of a brave little Londoner saving Africa from resource-stealers.Ho-ho-ho!
3,Not like Disney movies,My grandchildren did not like this movie. It just didn't grab their attention. I will not buy this kind of movie again.
4,Good family fun,"This child of the 1950's loves the character of Eliza Thornberry, perhaps because there weren't any spunky female characters like her when I was growing up. Imagine! A cartoon, and now a movie, featuring a girl in the lead role! Another thing I appreciate is that the parents are not portrayed as idiots. This is a welcome change from the standard fare in modern media. The story is pretty predictable, but doesn't drag. Some parts may be scary for little ones. Nice music. Overall, a film the whole family can enjoy."
3,Wild movie,"The Thornberrys are a delightful family, but there's nothing subtle about this film. It's not bad enough for the bad guys to be poachers; they would also stoop to murdering children to bag a single animal. The lighter side of this story is fun and engaging, and the animation is wonderful. Darwin the chimp is so cute. Is it too much of a challenge to feature the Thornberrys in a more realistic and less violent environmental movie? Teenagers may be too old to appreciate this film's charms, but it's more than tolerable for parents."
2,oh please,"think about it, the movie was ok, but was there a point to make this movie? it was better off on tv. listen if u liked it, get it, but im staying with my thoughts of it and my thought said boring!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Could of had so much more...,"I'm glad Third Day has put out a live release to compliment their 2004 tour. I just wish they put more content on the DVD and CD.First off, the DVD is just over an hour long. There are afew nice supplements, but where's a commentary? Where's somebonus songs?The CD is even shorter, only 9 live songs plus ""Thank You All.""Bottom line: This set should have more stuff on it!!!"
5,fabulous book,"Using it for my undergraduate thesis; it's lucidly written, incredibly informative, and very enjoyable. Feels completely relevant in 2009 despite being published some time ago. Highly recommended."
5,A hilarious guide to the vagaries of lesbian relationships.,This is a smart and engrossing guide to the ups and downs of lesbian love. Hall shows us how to survive by refining and retelling the stories of our relationships. Her experience as a couples therapist serves her well. I loved her beautifully crafted prose and clever puns. There is nothing corny or judgmental here. It's just fresh. I really couldn't put it down. A definite all-nighter--you don't have to be a lesbian to enjoy this book!
1,don't waste your time,"This book was given to me by a friend to read as an example of a good self-help book. It purports to be a guide to ""how to survive everything from heartthrob to heartbreak"", but I read the whole thing without getting any useful information. I gave this book its one star because of the personal stories, which I found to be relate-able, but there was no real ""advice"" here, just the author's pet thesis, which I found not only less than helpful, but also relatively patronizing. A much more helpful book (and funnier too) is So You Want to be a Lesbian? by Liz Tracey and Sydney Pokorny. While it was written tongue-in-cheek, it offers 100% more advice on hooking up and surviving a broken heart than Hall's. I am really glad I didn't spend the money on this book."
4,Wisconsin Weeping Willow,"I would recommend this dealer, Stark Bros Nurseries, for purchasing any nursery item. The tree was received in good shape. The price was very fair."
5,Hail Andy Kuntz!!!!,"This is really an awesome prog album fronted by Vanden Plas lead vocalist's Andy Kuntz. Superb Prog in its true sense. Only an artist such as Andy Kuntz cab pull it off. Full of melodic passages, heavy riff and great songwriting. Most of the songs are memorable with sing along choruses..... I felt like this is Vanden Plas' new album.. This album has a very grand theme and concept to it so I am totally enjoying and into ABYDOS. Emotionally attached to Abydos for sure......If you are a prog fan and knows about Vanden Plas... I urge you to get this. Never for once will disappoint you, I guaranteed!!"
4,great way to pass a boring evening,A typical nudie horror film from the early 70s with some great bizarre neo psychedelic camera work! Of note -the extraordinary great soundtrack which sounds like dj shadow circa 1972- a mix of pounding sparse tribal drums spooky analog synths and almost hip hop big beats ! I would love to see the soundtrack released on its own! All in all not a bad movie- far from great but a fun way to kill 90 minutes.
3,Disappointment,"This book was disappointing for me. Most of the pictures are limited to designs from the years 1987-1995 - a fairly limited scope for a book with such a grand title. The photos are not all that great - their style is typical and safe, and becomes quite repetitive throughout the book. The cover photo is by far the best. After some introductory history which would be informative for a fashion novice, the text tries to be a poetic description and explanation of the picture - OUCH! Despite the disappointment, there are some very nice designs, which are shown in detail."
5,Skrebneski's talent as a premier fashion photographer shines,"Skrebneski brings the passion in these gowns worn by models to life in his dramatically light photographs.The gowns of Sardian, John Anthony, Cristobal Balenciaga, Pierre Balmain, Erik Mortensen, Geoffery Beene, Chanel, Lagerfeld, Dior, Gerre, Feraud, Galanos, De Givenchy (his source of inspiration throught out his career) Charles James, Lacroix, Lanvin, Montana, Laroche Norell, Poiret, Erte, Ricci, Gerard Pipart, Saint Laurent, Arnold Scaasi, Scherrer, Schiaparelli, Ungaro, Valentino, Philippe Venet, Versace, Mdme. Vionnet and Vera Wang are photographed in the most dramatic sense. The detail of couture is fully illustrated.This book is an inspiration to all who are interested in fashion design."
1,False advertising!,"This is NOT the Helicoptor you will get. This is a picture of Tonka's BIG helicoptor, and they are passing it off as this one. Beware, things look better than they are."
2,What doesn't the man fit!?,My son wanted this thing so much so we decided to get it for him only to discover that the man doesn't fit in the cockpit!!?? I'm tired of toy companies and any manufacturer creating such dumb mistakes! Whoever designed this or decided to include a man should be fired if they already haven't. Does anyone actually care what kind of product they are putting out anymore? Luckily my son doesn't care too much and usually doesn't want the man in there anyway or else this thing would end up right back at the store. WAKE UP TONKA!!!!!
1,Bloody Awful,"A pure fantasy comic book like adventure. Slightly better than his debut ""Hawke"", but that ain't saying much. I can't imagine reading any more of this series. James Bond? LOL"
4,Great spy tale. I really enjoy the recurring character and his crew of buchaneers.,"The recurring character, Alex Hawke and his many cohorts, are always a great read and the mystery is well-written and very intriguing. We know Alex is always going to live through another ordeal, but it makes you wonder how he will escape each escapade."
2,disjointed,"There is a good basic plot in this ""high adventure"" novel but inconsistencies, contradictions and repetitive descriptions distract from it. Book editors should have caught them. Skip this one and go straight to Tsar - it's better written."
5,great book,"Bought this book for my brother, he loved this book and I received it in the mail in a very timely manner."
1,No thrill in loose writing.,"I, too, took Glen Beck's word for this book.To say it strains credulity is being way nicer than it deserves.Dont pick up this book if you like writing that hangs together, is at least vaguely believable and indulges in real character developement."
2,Disappointed,"I must say that I agree with Belinda in her assessment of this book. There is evidently a first Hawke novel, although I have not read it. The characters in this book apparently depend on the other to ""flesh"" themselves out. Their development in this book was very weak. Hawke really is unbelievable as a character. There is no place that he hasn't been or thing he is not the best at. The second plot line was added just to use a few more characters. It was OK as a ""summer read"" but there are better thrillers out there that deserve our reading time."
1,"Whatever you do, don't read it...","This is my first ever Amazon review. If I stop one person from wasting their time and money on this book, my efforts will have been worthwhile.Let me provide a little context: I really like tongue-in-cheek trash fiction. Bond, Pitt, even Bourne, are entertaining. I even read Jeffrey Archer!Bell, however, has created a miserable work. The prose is leaden. The plot twists are beyond predictable. The characters are made of kevlar re-inforced carboard. The lifestyle aspired to is ridiculous. C'mon, a silver spoon in mouth English lord who is also a commando, corporate raider, secret agent who tells the President of the US what do, and lover to the Secretary of State? This doesn't bend, it breaks. The kicker is that this ridiculous uber-mensch also has pretentious taste in wine.Run away before you do something stupid, like buy this book."
2,amateurish and cartoonish,"Are you kidding? Mindless drivel is just piled on with no sense whatsoever. Every woman is beautiful, every man is deadly and plot makes no sense and the whole thing stinks. I read this one first and then wanted to read Hawke but now forget it. I'd rather watch paint dry."
1,Totally disappointed!,"I also bought this book based on Glenn Beck's hype of it and am now considering ending my Insider account with him. You can't tell me Glenn really thought this book was great. And to tell all of his listeners everyday for the last coulpe months how incredible this book is - what a joke. He's a total sell out. Maybe someone who has never read another book in their life might find these characters interesting, or the story line thrilling - but honestly it read like a bad Steven Seagal movie made into an even worse book."
1,SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!,"Ted Bell must have a lot of family and friends to write all of these nice reviews- because after reading this book, I don't understand why ANYONE would think this book had any substance whatsoever. I bought this book because it came highly recommended by Glenn Beck, and am thoroughly disappointed that I actually paid money for it. I kept expecting the book to get better but it never did.I want those 6 hours of my life back."
2,not as ordered,"Shown as ""like new"". Arrived with dog-eared page. Not quite what I expected. I think flaws of this nature in an almost new, signed first/first ought to be described."
4,assassin,"Good reading material, full us suspence, fast flowing with no gaps. suggestion to read author first book."
1,Verbose,Mr. Bell certainly likes to see himself write. He could have cut out a hundred pages and still have too many. It was very difficult getting through the overuse of adjectives. I will not be reading any other Bell tomes.
3,A Bit Over the Top,"This is the first Ted Bell novel I have read, and I was a little disappointed. While I certainly enjoyed the plot, I came away thinking the lead character was just too much of a ""superman."" Bell portrayed his hero as flawless, handsome, brilliant, overwhelmingly wealthy, etc. I almost began to expect Bell to reveal that Alex was actually God."
4,Good Adventure,Well written adventure novel that is reminiscent of the James Bond series. I like it but my credulity is strained by the super hero larger than life persona of Alex Hawke. It is a great story but it is almost a comic book in that it is not believable.Scott
3,Assassin: Ted Bell,"I enjoyed the book but it was not one of my favorites. I prefer Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, Tom Clancy and James W. Huston."
1,A book Tom Clancy would've written,"...in high school. I intended to hammer on the abundance of cliches in this book, but others have beat me to it. I short, if you can relate to a rich, pedigreed, intelligent, handsome, decorated war hero with zero character flaws, than Ethan Hawke is your man. And no, a penchant for margaritas is not a character flaw.I actually shouted at the book out of frustration a couple times. Imagine your father or grandfather trying to rap or talk teenage slang, and you'll get an idea of how awkward some of the dialog feels. It gave me a nosebleed just trying to read the parts featuring the ""Stokely Jones'"" character.This was the first and last Ted Bell novel that I'll ever read. Shame on you Glenn Beck for talking this up so much on your radio program."
1,Unreadable Drivel,"Wildly illogical plot, improbable dialog, strangely developed characters and you have a really difficult read. A former Navy SEAL/NYPD detective who always talks like an uneducated crack dealer working closely with a member of the British gentry and other unlikely characters trying to snag a 400 pound Arabic-speaking psychopath with a really strangely contrived name irritates me to no end and makes me want to pitch the book. But, the cover price has risen more than 50% so I'll slog my way through this mess through to the end. Ted Bell is definitely off my reading list. Pity: I generally enjoy British writers - not this one."
1,dismal,"The build up is- these guys are top of the line agents- and yet they are consistently blundering their way into, and blundering out of situations- if they are that good, how are they soconsistently surprised? Sophomoric, especially when Mr. Bell attempts to write black American jive as the Stokely character."
1,Nearly Blasphemous,"A truly terrible book. I mean that. For Mr. Bell to dare invoke the name of the great Genius P.G. Wodehouse is nearly blasphemous. Wodehousian prose was lyrical: Bell is a butcherer of the English language. Only a Wodehouse afficionado can appreciate the rabid fury I am experiencing. ""Assassin,"" as a book, is so sloppily written I fully intend to take it outside tomorrow and shoot it (possibly more than once) thereby saving my family and friends the agony found within its pages. I have heard hints that Ted Bell may be on the NYT's best sellers list--If that is true, I am extremely dissapointed. If you want a good book, read the masters. Rex Stout, Dorothy Sayers, Wodehouse himself, or any number of craftsmen (and women) who really appreciated the art of storytelling. Ted Bell, and I can't stress this enough, is a hack. Glen Beck, you have greatly dissapointed me. By endorsing this book you have lowerd my esteem of you no end."
2,"Good story, interesting characters, but author needs a better editor","Yes, the story is pretty unbelievable, very much in the same class of the works of Fleming, Cussler, etc. However, it is not the story or the character development that makes this a below average read.......the author really needs to change editors. This book could be improved immeasurably by a better job of good editing. Way too wordy, too many extra pages, scenes, action, etc, that do not add anything of value to the overall story and do much to impede the flow. Did the author get paid by the word? Get a bonus for going over 300 pages? Editing, editing, editing."
1,don't be fooled,"At least two of the three people who have reviewed this book previously would like you to believe they have actually purchased and read this book. `Strategic Newspaper Management' is not what its title and price suggest -- a solid, in-depth guide to the business of newspaper management. What it is an overpriced, superficial textbook aimed at freshmen wondering if they should ``go into'' journalism and what jobs they might fill at a newspaper (reporter? ad salesperson? maybe, someday, a circulation manager?)Take it from an experienced newspaper manager, this book is not going to help you navigate the thorny economic, political and ethical issues facing newspapers today. It's not going to entertain you, either."
4,good stuff,yeah! Automator comes sick again with Keith.....again. If you feel like you need some more stuff after listening to DR. Octo get this. It also has a track with Dj Q bert and we all know what that means. soooo if you want some good music get this
2,gets old fast,"Some nice ideas but the album gets boring really fast. Just too much repetition.Kool Keith's stuff is good. It can't hold this album up though. Listen to it once, it a good album. Hear it again and it falls apart."
5,Automator + Kool Keith = The best,"This album is the best. Of all the stuff I've heard done by both Kool Keith and Automator, this union is truly the best. The track ""it's over now"" is probably my favorite Kool Keith song ever. It's really too bad these two don't work together anymore because this album and Dr. Octagon are two of my favorite albums ever. This one has a great mood though. Reminds me of DJ Shadows stuff, but with Kool Keith's voice on some of the tracks. If you don't have this already, buy it now! You won't be sorry."
4,DR. OCTAGON PART TWO (Slighty),"This cd is dope! Not just because I'm a Kool Keith fan and been one for over 10 years,the music,the rhythms,the patterns of all songs are all that,except the two songs ""Wiling"" & ""Buck Buck"",the music kicks in those joints but the rappers Neph The Madman & Poet spoil a great Automator production. Hearing Q-Bert on ""I Want Da Mic"" sounds like a Dr. Octagon reunion. Saviour this joint because a reunion is highly unlikely."
2,"The Automator usually fails on ""solo"" albums, so to say.","Before you stone me to death, here me out. If you own this album, chances are, you own both the groundbreaking Dr. Octagon with that looney toon Kool Keith, and the ultramodern space novel better known as Delton 3030, with Del the Funky Homosapien. Both produced by the wizardry expertise of Dan the Automator. Arguably, the two best produced hip-hop albums, ever. So, tell me why his technically ""solo"" albums come up so short in comparsion? Especially this one.The first two tracks with Kool Keith, or Sinister 6000 to be exact, are really the only official classic cuts. The instrumentals are dope, but nothing really up to The Automator's standard. Overall, very average album. Low replay value."
2,Almost Okay,"I was very excited about the release of Silver Box because it included the ""lost"" album ""Our Secrets Are the Same."" Perhaps I need more time to digest all five disks, but it didn't really rattle my cage. I more enjoyed the earlier cuts, studio demos of Jim and Charlie's first few albums. I agree that the song list is quite uneven. I would have hoped for more of their earlier work, especially the songs that are only available on the out-of-print ""Early Years"" album. The addition of ""Our Secrets Are the Same"" is also a disappointment. If you want new material from Simple Minds, buy ""Cry"" and wait for ""Black and White."" This is not essential."
2,book condition was fine,"but the content wasn't. now, i'm an international, and i have absolutely no background in jazz music and everything african american related, so i couldn't understand any inference at all."
3,The Jumbo of the Jazz Age,"Ishmael Reed's Mumbo Jumbo is one of the most famous literary works written by an African American. Mumbo Jumbo takes place in the 1920's in places like New Orleans and Harlem. At this time the Harlem Renaissance and the Jazz Age were coming about. The book deals with the Jazz age with new types of dirty dancing, voo-doo, templars and secret societies going on. Reed is able to mix portraits of historical figures and his own made up characters. The book shows the conflict between Jes Grew, the black cultural impulse and Western traditions which Reed refers to as Atonists. The book was very fun and interesting to read but can get confusing at times. Although I would recommend this book anyone to read, especially to those people who love to dance!!!!"
2,Mumbo Jumbo,"I felt the book was confusing and very hard to follow. I had no idea what was going on the first 100 pages or so until it was brought up in class. Also, the book skipped around too much and I was constantly lost, and found myself reading many pages over again to try and figure out what was going on. The one thing I did like, however, was the story line. I felt Reed had some real potential with it, but the way it was written made the book too hard to follow."
2,mumbo jumbo review,"The book mumbo jumbo, by Ishmael Reed, is a story about well, it seems almost nothing. The title of this book clearly explains the issues and storyline throughout the book. The book is supposedly to be a humorous take on western civilization, but the way it is written makes it hard to understand. From dialoge with no quotation to paragraphs with no punctuation, the story is hard to follow and very distracting. If one has the time to re-read all the passages and figure out all the hidden meanings than it can probably be an interessting book full of humorous events, but I did not, so i didn't get as much out of it as I could have. Read it for yourself to see, but be aware of the confusion."
4,read this book !,"this is the first book by ishmael reed i have read and it was great. a tour-de-force of language and sound, this book makes obvious the absurdity of the current and past state of race relations in this country. although the narrative structure is unorthodox, this is really not a difficult book to follow in terms of storyline, at least for anyone who has an open mind and isn't expecting to be spoon fed a plot. the basic battle here is between the new religions of sterile GOD and the old ones of animism, gods and demons, but really this is about holding on to that unmeasurable quality that we call SOUL. read this book with an open mind and i promise you will laugh or at least smirk to yourself on several occasions, and it may just make you want to thrust your hips and twist and shake your bootie in defiance of all those who wish to suppress that primal urge that lives within us all."
2,Not a very good book......,"I feel the book Mumjo Jumbo by Ishmeal Reed was very confusing, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I think in order to understand the book it is necessary to be familiar with United States history, and even then it is extremely confusing. There are too many characters being introduced at one time, and the book keeps jumping around to different people and places. He had strange ways of using grammer, and punctuation that i doubt anyone can understand- i do not think it had any relevent meaning to the book. I think Reed had the potential to write a good story-but tried too hard and failed miserably. I would not recommend this book to anyone- the only reason I continued to read it is because it was a required text for my class."
1,confused,"I found this book very hard to understand. The storyline was extremely hard to follow. The book did not state exactly what it meant and I am not very good at interpreting things and finding the deeper meanings. This book was very challanging and requires a lot of time to figure things out and I personally do not have that kind of time to spend on one book.I do not think that this book is meant for young children or even teenagers, unless they haver a good understanding of the Harlem renaissance and the crusades. I personally do not know much about these topics and had a hard time with the book. With the knowledge of these topics hopefully the book wouldn't be as challanging for those who decide to read it."
1,This Book was... umm... :-/,"Is it possible to review a book that nobody understands? Well, i'm going to give it a shot. Mumbo Jumbo is a book that no1 would read 2wise. In face, I don't see why any1 would finish it after reading the 1st 10 pages. The story skipped around so much that I just didn't care any more. When a character died I didn't think ""why did he have to die?"" or ""o-man, I really liked that character"". I just thought ""I wish all these characters would die so this darn story would end"". But unfortunately I had to continue reading. The way it was written just made me mad. The way he used ""1"" instead of ""one"", or ""1000000"" instead of ""a million"" just made me stop reading and try to find Reed's address and send him a dictionary. So I guess you could say I really liked this book. ""What?! HUH?? But you just said..."" Exactly, I don't know..."
1,Huh?,"I think I missed the boat on this one. I found it totally confusing that Reed constantly changes point of view and location. Worse than confusing, however, is that in doing this we don't care about any of the characters. Even when they die I'm not inspired to shed a tear. Reed wants to be the African American Kurt Vonnegut, but I'm sorry to say that this effort falls far short of that mark."
1,Mumbo Jumbo....that's all it is,"I am in a book club and we read this and everyone was at a loss about it. Noone could follow it and noone enjoyed it. The question for discussion for our meeting is ""Why is it appropriate that the hero of Mumbo Jumbo be named after the West African god of language?"" We have no idea. Maybe someone out there can help us clear up things for our group."
4,great set of horseshoes,"Nice set of horseshoes. If you are a novice it even has instructions on how to set up your ""pits"" and how to score."
5,"Hakluyt's ""Principal Voyages"" - Penguin Edition","An excellent resource for anyone interested in the early English voyages to North America (16th and 17th centuries). It is an abridged edition, however, not the complete text. I believe that a new edition of the full text (the last one was in 1909) is about to be undertaken. For Hakluyt scholars, there is a seminar planned at the Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England, in May 2008. Details are available from the museum's website."
3,Obsolete,"Milsap's ""40 #1 HITS"" collection makes this one obsolete. That one includes everything you'll find here except ""All's Fair in Love and War"" & ""Turn That Radio On"", & does include many hits that should be included on any ""essential"" Milsap collection. Well worth the extra money."
5,Very Good,"Good recording quality and a good over all selection. For me, ""One Hit Wonders"" type of albums let me have the song I want without having to buy a whole album that doesn't make the top 10."
5,TAKE ME BACK,HERE THEY ARE. THE SOUND TRACK OF YOUR LIFE. 35 AND 40 YEAR OLD HITS FROM MY YOUNG MARRIED YEARS. VERY POIGNANT. A FLOOD OF MEMORIES OF PLACES AND PEOPLE...ALL ORIGINAL RECORDINGS SOUND PERFECT. SO WORTH THE MONEY!
3,Could have left off 3 songs.,"It had 3 songs on it I have always detested: Seasons in the Sun, Sometimes When We Touch, and Precious and Few...GAG!"
4,Loose lips don't sink this ship,"Robb White has an in-your-face writing style that is refreshing and extremely readable. With all the hijinks, odd characters and tall tales, he actually tells you something about boat building."
5,It's Not About Canoes,"Robb White's biographical tales, essays, or ruminations and commentary are loosely organized around his life spent messing about in small boats. You'd think this would lead to a narrow view of life's twists and turns but he uses a series of occurrences (almost not quite events) in his experience to draw some philosophical conclusions that are straightforward and thoughtful but delivered in such a subtle manner that they kind of sneak up on you. I was sorry when I finished Tin Canoe so I had to go out and find everything else he wrote. After all, how often do you find yourself laughing at what he's written and thinking ""You got that right."""
5,"When this ""Skeeter"" bites, you're hooked!","Spectacular! The quality and range of Skeeter Davis' vocal talent and style are beyond my ability to praise or even describe adequately. Warm and potent as moonshine. This NYC boy has never been to Kentucky, but I'd walk a country mile to hear any track on this phenomenal CD."
3,Disappointed,"This album is a collection of much older cuts that were not very well known. Ok I guess, but I was expecting a different collection of music. More known vs unknown."
5,"""Big Eden"" Brought Me To.......","This Cd That Features The WONDERFUL ""OPTIMISTIC""!But There Is So Much More To Enjoy! ""The End Of The World"" Is A Great Song! I Thank The Producers Of ""BIG EDEN"" For Having Such A Great Soundtrack(That's Not Availible)!!!"
1,crooked company,"acehardwareoutlet did not send to me the item I ordered, instead they sent to me a cheap substitute. It is the age old con game called ""Bait & Switch"". Very dishonest group."
1,watering timer,This unit measures the amount of water IN GALLONS that is being applied to your lawn or landscape. If you are attempting to use it to control a drip irrigation system it does NOT work. The drip irrigation system would need to run for hours to even begin to make the timer register start to move. Probably would work satisfactorily if you were watering with a fire hose.
1,AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX VHS INCORRECT POSTING ALSO,"The title of this VHS is confused with ""The T.V. Show"" directed by Tom Trbovich and starring Rob Reiner. The T.V. Show (1979) is very funny, but it is not on the tape listed as ""Gary Shandling Show: 25th / TV Show (1979)"", or associated with it in any way. Rob Reiner does not appear. (The Shandling tape was actually released in 1986). The following postings also have the same problem: Best of Soap / TV Show (1979), Funniest & Wackiest Commercials / TV Show (1979), Lawrenceville Stories / TV Show (1979), and Little Rascals Gift Set / TV Show (1979), all of which incorrectly list Tom Trbovich as director."
3,Good for certain gardeners,"I bought this book as I love most books that pertain to Southern gardening. I have most of Michael Dirr's books, for example, and and love them all. This book is quite a bit different - it has a lot of chapters that pertain to garden planning, soil preparation, fertilizers, weed eradication, tools, pots and the like. There is less specific information about particular plants here than I expected - the chapter on shrubs is only 7 pages long, to give an example. There are very few photographs of plants or trees, and these are in black and white. So, it depends on what you want in a garden book to decide if this is for you."
1,Not what I was looking for,"New to Louisiana, I was looking for a book that would tell me what plants would do well in my yard and vegetable garden. There is very little about specific plants; lots about soil preparation, etc., and lots of argument between the two authors about what is best. I don't need argument or entertainment, I need information."
1,Annoying and boring,"Sawyer's command of the English languish leaves little to be desired; in fact, nothing even for which to hope. Grammatical errors abound in this cliche-riddled story. The characters are uniformly single- or un-faceted, especially the women. Heinlein for the 90s. We get much more detail about some areas than we could possibly want, and much less about others than we need. Save your money."
2,Sorry I bought it -- a one-time read at most,"I saw several good reviews of this book but I can't say I really liked it. I think both the Nazi stuff (oh, come on!) and the cloning stuff is old hat by these days and his ""family life"" scenes show that he should stick with science and not try to do characters --he's not good at characters! I gave my copy to my local library because I won't want to read it again."
2,Too many interesting ideas,"The ideas around which ""Frameshift"" revolves are intriguing. Unfortunately, there appear to be a few too many of them to cover in this rather short book: A scientist wrestles with a deadly genetic disease; discovers a telepathy gene in his wife; uncovers a secret Nazi death camp guard; his wife gives birth to a Neanderthal clone (although she is a PhD herself, neither notices anything ""wrong"" for a long time!); finds a secret code in ""junk"" DNA. The plot twists left me feeling abused rather than amused or intellectually challenged. A much stronger book would have taken just ONE of these story lines and developed it in greater depth. The ideas are interesting - I liked reading about Berkeley, where I was a postdoc. The writing style is spare and doesn't get in the way of the plot. Unfortunately, as it is, I felt like I was reading the script of a made for TV movie - probably the FOX channel."
3,Many ideas with so-so execution,"There is a lot here. Genetic evolution, telepathy, disease, an attempted murder and murder mystery, the holocaust and the hunt for Nazi war criminals, a corrupt insurance company, and a love story. Within the span of the book, it all connects somehow. But the connections are, in the end, not all that strong. Believability was stretched to the limit for me, and there were simply too many ideas to squeeze into a workable story. The first couple of chapters held promise for an emotionally riveting story, but the promise was never fulfilled. Sawyer's writing was effective, and the book flowed easily, despite its shortcomings. I read this quicker than most books that I considered average, and yet it was also average. Attribute that to Sawyer's skill. His strength of ideas was the reason for the uneven read - it created a lost focus of story that just couldn't be recovered."
4,A real sci-fi/high-tech/thriller from beginning to end,"This book takes you on a rollercoaster ride that involves so many plot twists and surprises that you never know what to expect until you turn that page. And you know you MUST read on! This book has taken its rightful place with my collection of Old School sci-fi and cyberpunk: ""Foundation"", ""Empire"", ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Childhood's End"", ""Prey"", ""Snow Crash"", ""Neuromancer"", ""Cryptonomicon"", and ""Darkeye: Cyber Hunter""."
4,"A Canadian scientist ""Bob and Doug"" could be proud of","I like the hero and I like the story. Sawyer also mixes in some nice social commentary, and does it in a way where he presents multiple sides. Too bad the other charcters in this book weren't given a little more depth. For example, The monster-Nazi war criminal idea is a little to cliche and a bit insulting to a reader intelligence. The evil HMO. This book is a good main character in an exciting story in a cardboard world. Call me a sap, but I was touched by the ending."
2,Contrived plot with errors of science -not well written,This was a very dissapointing book considering it was a Nebula finalist. The plot is contrived and there are numerous mistakes in the molecular biology descriptions. A gene for telepathy is introduced for storyline convenience with little discussion of the implications. The crazy nazi theme is hackneyed.
1,Paper jams every time,"Tried to contact HP customer, spent 1/2 hour on the phone, no result. Had to return it and get a Canon."
1,I'm good with technology. This thing is a piece of crap.,"I bought this for my parents and it's been a disaster from moment one. The first machine refused to run over the network despite myriad adjustments and phone calls to HP. Unit was replaced (with a remanufactured unit, of course) that also refused to run over the network and eventually stopped printing. Only after reading the riot act to HP did they send a third unit, which prints but won't scan over the network, and its ADF is DOA.The driver is clunky, HUGE even when minimally installed, and takes an act of Congress to get off of your machine entirely.HP used to charge a premium for a premium product. Now they charge a premium for garbage."
1,very cheap & unreliable,"I have one of these in my office and it's pretty horrible.The bad:1> ink cartridges don't last long2> auto-feed scanner jams 50% of the time3> materials used to make it are really cheap4> gets errors and only way to correct is to unplug it5> really long warmup time6> software packaged with it is really bloated; there's a bunch of junk packaged with it, but the main useful piece, HP director, is just really memory & processor intensiveThe good:1> print quality is pretty good2> once scanned, can save to several different formats (word, pdf, image file, etc)All-in-all, avoid this one."
1,Expensive Disposable Printer,I purchased this expensive All in one 12-30-2005 exactly 2 months after warranty while replacing black ink cartridge. The plastic piece that holds the metal clip in place broke off and is not repairable or replaceable. BUYER BEWARE! HP printers are not same quality as they used to be. This is very expensive for a DISPOSABLE product!!!!
3,Update: Glitches are a stopper; print basics are fine,"I've owned the HP OfficeJet 7210 for about two months now. Print quality is excellent, speed more than acceptable, ease of installation and use OK. Faxing and copying are fine.I have had problems, however...After the unit repeatedly disappeared from the Windows XP network here at home, I finally gave up on that and connected the printer via USB 2 (nice flexibility, that). The USB hookup has had problems as well: the unit needs to be restarted weekly so my nine-month-old computer can see it again.The software is another problem. It's far too much of a good (actually, mediocre) thing. I'd prefer a simple print driver but HP doesn't seem to give a way to specify just that. The entire software packge is a performance boat anchor. If you buy the unit, try to intall the minimal software that works for you.Finally, I've experienced increasing paper jams.All in all, I'd probably look elsewhere for my next all-in-one unit."
2,Proceed with caution,I recently upgraded from the 7110 which I was satisfied with. However it only lasted a total of two years before dieing. I do quite a bit of color printing. If you do as well I recommend that you select another printer. The ink cartridges on this printer are very small. HP has ripped us off by using a smaller ink cartridge and charging a higher list price. So you get both the inconvenience of needing to replace your cartridges more often and paying OUTRAGEOUS prices for the tiny cartridges.
4,Great For Everything Except Scanning.,"This is the first All-In-One I have purchased. I have limited space, so thought I would replace the fax machine with a machine that could do everything instead of getting a scanner and color printer, which would take up more counter space. The printer works very well. The fax works very well. It has a document feeder, so more than one page can be fed through easily. The print quality is not as good as a laser printer or photo printer, but is OK. The problem I ran into is with the scanner. It is set to scan at 200 dpi. This yeilds a copy which so faint, it is almost illegible and portions of text and pictures are missing. I increased the setting to 1200 dpi. This worked better, but the print was still grey instead of sharp black. It took 45 minutes to scan and save an 11 page document. So, if you have oodles of time and don't care what it looks like, this might work for you. I'm trying to decide at this point whether to take it back or not."
4,"After almost 5 years of using this product, product still works like new.","This is one of best printer, I ever bought. After almost 5 years of usages and abuse, this printer still works without any problems. Thank you HP for creating such a great product. No problem, this thing just printing. Not a one day I had problem with this printer. I love it. I just bought duplex device. I never knew it was existed. I wish I knew it earlier. Excellent printer, no problem at all."
3,Printer: Great. Scanning Software: A Pain. Customer Service: Atrocious!,"Print quality: great. Price: great. Scanning software: not so great (read other reviews as well). HP Customer Service; awful! I spent 2.5 hours on the phone trying to resolve an issue with the printer installed on an ethernet. Got dropped after holding for 15 minutes+ THREE TIMES and then got a low-level tech support person who tried to tell me the printer would never work with a laptop connected to my router wirelessly at the same time other computers were connected via cable! Definitely not true. Luckily that connection got dropped as well, and I finally just reinstalled the software on my laptop. Oh, and the install CD was not in the box; I had to download the ginormous file. Very annoying... and yet still a good printer."
1,Mac compatibility sucks,"The hardware is fine, but as with my last Office Jet, the software is INFURIATING. I use Mac (OX 10.3.9) and the software will not allow me to print more than a single page at a time. In other words, if I try to print a 5-page document, the printer only prints page 5. I have tried everything -- nothing resolves (and it's not the word processing, because this occurs with Microsoft Word, Appleworks, etc.) Worse, HP's help phone is horrendous -- you talk to people in India who do their best, but are clearly flummoxed and can barely be understood over the phone. A big disappointment."
4,"The good, the bad, and the ugly","I looked at a lot of multi machines before purchasing. Settled on a Cannon or the HP 7210.The good: Despite reviews saying Cannon multis were better for color quality on copies, my in-store comparison showed that HP color copy was better, much higher fidelity. The 7210 also had much easier controls on the machine itself. The machine in itself is great.The bad: The scanning software is not very good. HP was trying to do too much by using a central suite of software to control all aspects of the machine. The software often fails on my computer, and several HP sub-programs do not close on their own, forcing me to close them using task manager. Admittedly, I am running an old computer, but it isn't ancient. The software should function well, but doesn't.The ugly: I've found it easier to scan using Windows built-in imaging software.Overall, I like the machine and look forward to getting the bugs worked out. Maybe it will force me to buy a new computer."
2,Great printer until it breaks,"This printer was very easy to set up on our home network. It prints both color and bs fast, copies and scans well over the network, and handles photos fairly well. Unfortunately it only lasted 19 months. The simple act of replacing the black ink cartridge broke something within the cartridge holder. I thought it was a spring as its plastic mount was broken off. Nothing that a dab of gorilla glue couldn't handle. But that didn't do the trick and I can't see what else is wrong.We have a bunch of these printers at work and two of them have stop working as well. Trying to get HP support is very frustrating. HP's Chat is useless. These are clearly made to be disposible when they break. HP doesn't support its products and these printers are not of the same quality as the old HP LaserJets. Shame, because the network printer is a great idea and this printer otherwise would be a great printer.So I'm now searching for a non-HP networked printer to replace this one."
4,"Great Printer, questionable support","I bought this printer to replace a 5 year old All-in-One HP. I uninstalled the old driverts first even though the software didn't mention it, I knew it was a good idea. The install went good on 2 PC's but hung on the MAC. The only problem is as a Network device, Some things don't work-I can not check the Ink level via the ToolBox. But can via Web I/F. HP tech was slow, I started telling him the answers to his statements to speed things up. I asked him if there was a known problem when using it over the network and he started to say No, then maybe, then yes after 30 minutes. Scanning s fine even on wireless computer, I just wish there support would give a straight answer the first time and stop wasting my time."
2,stupid me,"Develops errors after just a few months. Owned 3 of these, each one errors after a few months, but will still function w/errors. They typically last for 1 or 2 ink refills, basically a Chinese-made disposable product. Mine is currently traveling to the Phoenix land fill. Stupid me, been a long time owner of these, last 3 printers. Never again, will try the Canon line."
4,Overall a very very good product; only problem is noise,"Got this about one month ago to replace my Brother 5840 AIO, which was incredibly slow in copying and printing. This is a good product--much faster at scanning, printing, and copying than the brother. It's also about twice as much but IMO worth it. Only negative is that it makes quite a bit of noice. Previously I had a HP 6100 AIO and it made the same grinding noise-that one ending up dying after about 2.5 years. Still, if I have to spend $280 (price I paid for HP 7210) every two years to get this speed and quality, I'll be ok with that. Oh, one of the best things about this printer is the network readiness. It installed without a hitch--had everything up and running in less than 10 minutes."
2,An error message and scratch in the paper,"I am so sorry I bought this 3-in-1 printer/fax/scanner. I get a message every time I print telling me ""New HP Photo Cratridge successfully installed"". I have been on the phone with HP for 3 hours with no solution.Also, 3 weeks after I bought it, I started seeing a line in my pictures. Another problem with no solution.I have lost faith in HP products and am now looking for a more reliable unit from another maker."
2,"Lousy software, slow to print, older model","I've owned an HP7210 All in One printer for several years. The first one was defective, and replaced free by HP. The replacement worked OK for 3-4 years. I don't print much. Cons: The software is crummy, the scan function doesn't work unless I reinstall the software EVERY TIME I want to scan. Worked OK as a network printer (wired through router, NOT wireless.)There are better choices, see Cnet printer reviews. I'll be buying a new printer with at least 4 ink cartridges, that's wireless from the get-go. I wouldn't recommend buying this model."
1,Not Vista Compatible - Software is Horrible,"I could not recommend this printer. When it works it is great but often it doesn't. In Vista the printer constantly gets unloaded and you have to reinstall the software which should be called bloatware because it takes long and has so many add ons that you do not need. All I need to do is print and scan but HP, once a great name in this business, is incapable of just letting you do that and do it well. They have lost all touch with reality. Even the latest downloads from their website don't help."
1,"Junk, junk, junk! Have had 7 bad ones so far!!!","1st unit had bad logic board and died after about 1 week of use. Next one the power supply died within 1 month. 3rd unit had bad paper feeder. 4th unit same bad paper feeder problems but couple weeks after warranty ended and HP would not replace despite same problem they ""fixed"" earlier. Drivers are junk and buggy. In contrast we have a Canon All-in-One unit over a year with zero problems and a Canon printer about 2-3 years with no problems. Stay away from this HP (in fact all HP units) as it will be a pain dealing with the repair issues. My son also had a HP All-in-One that was replaced 3 times in 4 months. He finally ended up selling the replacement unit he received and buying a Canon All-in-one. All in all, 7 replacement units within 1 year between the 2 HP units in our home. Junk! Junk! Junk!"
5,Another view,"I can appreciate that folks who knew Issan Dorsey found this watered down. I, however, didn't, and I loved the book. It's a great counter to the prissiness that tinges most zen literature. This was the first thing I read that made me think, ""Well, if he was a zen teacher, maybe zen is something I want to explore.""For those who knew Issan and studied under him, please write books! He is an important teacher for the messiness and reality of this world, rather than the cozy sterility of a monastery, and I would love to know more about him."
4,Inspired,"I didn't know Issan Dorsey, but reading this book made me wish I did if only because he seemed a terribly interesting person and the course of his life is...well...amazing. I highly recommend it. As a gay man with an interest in Buddhism, this book was like a door opening."
3,The story of a true Bodhisattva,"I enjoyed this book, and nearly gave it four stars, but I felt that it was missing something.There was a little too much of the dark history. I know it was setting the stage, but I found that it went from depressing to numbing. Perhaps that's my own baggage: Having known drag queens, drug addicts, drug dealers, and hustlers, I guess I could have skipped over most of the first half of the book.The intimate details of death towards the end of the book were powerful, and appreciated. Again, perhaps it's just me, but it was refreshing to hear such honest detail without the author becoming gruesome or patronizing. Death, without the facade we in America often use to hide from it.Two things I would have enjoyed: (1) More details about the author's relationship with Issan, e.g., more conversations they had had simply as friends; (2) Samples of Issan's talks and teachings.Still, a good book about a great man."
4,MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.....,".............that's a lot of banana boat lotion! ( and gel.)Although I have not actually tried this, it doesn't look all that bad. If I could actually USE ANY SORT OF SUN-RELATED PRODUCT, OTHER THAN A TANNING BED up here in Satan's version of Hell itself, SEATTLE, I COULD USE IT!On a side note, I was angered BEFORE I wrote this review...Okay, the lotion is qute useful, and a thousand degrees (haha) better than the gel, in my opinion. The classic Aloe Vera gel for sunburns. I would suggest that you buy the lotion by itself, instead of with the gel.."
3,Not recommended for beginners,If you are new to options I do NOT recommend this DVD. It moves very fast and at the end of the DVD I had no practical information that might assist me in trading options.
4,Great story,"Morison was an old salt, and a very smart one. He also had a terrific store of knowledge, and it comes thru in this book."
4,Meh.,"This is probably better suited for the older end of the 4-8 range. It's a bit wordy, and my nieces didn't get into it at all. I'll shelve it until they're older.The ending of this story is slightly contrived. In my experience, bullies don't miraculously become your best friend, no matter how many cookies you offer them. And they don't help your mom come to you either."
2,Not that helpful,"A pretty book but not that useful. Just found a brand-new Better Homes and Gardens book on fireplaces, which I like much better. The BH&G book has handsome photos but lots of tips on making over a dated fireplace (which we have to do), as well as choosing and positioning a new fireplace (which we also plan to do in our master suite). The Better Homes and Gardens Fireplace book shows a wider range of room and furnishings styles than this House Beautiful book, in my opinion."
2,INSPIRIRATION,WE THANK AMAZON FOR SELLING THE PRODUCTS & ALSOHAVING A VARIETY OF THEM. JUDY JACOBS IS ONE OF GOD CHILDRENS THAT IS HIGHLYANOINED BY GOD. HEM MUSIC BRINGS DELIVERANCE & HEALING RGHT TO THE INNER CORE OF YOUR HEART. I CAN TRULY SAY SHE IS A WOMAN/PASTOR/CO PASTOR/EVANGELIST OF GOD
4,"""We're caught in a web and we're eaten alive""","4.5 stars. While I still think ""A Murder Of Crows"" is Deadsoul Tribe's benchmark album, if there was ever a band in which I would recommend newcomers buy two albums simultaneously it would be the aforementioned release and ""The January Tree"". ""A Murder of Crows"" doesn't have the punchy production value of ""The January Tree"" but it does have a more organic approach to the songwriting using piano, flute, acoustic instruments much more often than the hard-driving guitar attack of the follow-up album. ""The January Tree"" also incorporates more industrial stylings and keyboard effects than before; and while I prefer a more organic sound the improved production sound on ""The January Tree"" is a major plus that very nearly levels the playing field between the two recordings. All in all, both albums are worth buying for different reasons. Regardless of the differences, both albums hold great amounts of excellent music."
2,Listening to The January Tree? Don't forget a pillow,"Judging The January Tree from the perspective that the aim in music is to conjure an emotion, I believe this is the perfect album for those who seek to summon the boredom so vividly portrayed in Dead Soul Tribe's music.Devon Graves has returned with a third album. Although the artist name appearing on the album cover is ""Dead Soul Tribe,"" Graves handles all the writing, recording, and production for this effort (save the drums, played by Adel Moustafa).This boring, derivative album shows clear Dream Theater influence. Although the album was obviously well thought out, Graves succeeds in evoking the desired image of a dull, leafless tree with his tedious formulaic songwriting. Graves aimed to get a consistent level of quality among the different tracks on his album. He was unfortunately successful in this regard.I'd give this album a 2/5, since Graves was at least successful in evoking some image in his music."
5,Turn off the lights take a deep breath...Achillea!,I'm at a loss for words when describing this incredible mind journey but Enigma is back! I consider this album to be part of Enigma being Jen Gad worked with Cretu in previous Enigma albums. This album has elements that will remind you of Enigma it's a beautiful journey when heard. Truly Enigmatic! I can only hope his other work like Enigmatic Obsession will be released by Sequoia as well. Sequoia did a great job with this release as it's a beautiful CD. Jen Gad is a genius!
3,"Pretty nice music, a little bit short of Enigma.","It's quite nice, althought definitely not an Enigma, the female voice is beautiful, but quite monotonous all across most of the songs. Still a good addition to one's New Age sound collection."
3,Not Enigma and just average,"To portray this album as Enigma-like is a severe stretch [listen to the samples]. Despite nice artwork and production, the track melodies are unmemorable. There was nothing about this CD compelling another listen."
5,"Austerity and beauty all mesh on ""The Nine Worlds"".","I was entranced by the debut release by artist Achillea. To my peasant surprise, I leanred that it is also a side project of Enigma's guitarist and in terms of side-projects, Achillea is almost as good as Enigma.The debut album has a similar trademark to Enigma's album but the tracks stand out altogether with beauties like ""Odin's Hill"", ""The Garden if Lisfaraine"" and ""Seeres Prophecy"". Overall, ""The Nine Worlds"" is almost like a sequel to Enigma's third album from more than a decade ago.This is highly recommended."
5,Another work of art,"I bought this album after having adored Enigma, and was not disappointed. Jens Gad has a way of finding an intimate sound and creating an atmosphere around it. What is an intimate sound? I don't know, but he does."
4,The Nine Worlds,"An excellent CD, very moody and ethereal. If you like Enigma, you will certainly enjoy this one. The music flows well, so it's perfect for an energy class or meditation. Well done!"
3,Good but hard to see the light,It works well but when its daylight out u cant see light flashing. Other than that its pretty good. Thanks
1,Confusing labeling -this is A-6 not A-65,"Beware that this is the FiShock A-6 electric fence tester, not the FiShock (multi-light) A-65. Confusing names and similar size product and photos. With the similar Amazon currrent price, the A65 model is a much better deal. (And if you don't buy directly from Amazon, returns are much more of a hassle...) This product photo should be clearer to avoid ambiguity."
1,No total weight is given!,"Why would anyone buy this if they don't know how much it weighs? Yes, there are 8 bags, but is each one 2 ounces, 16 ounces, or what? This error is why Amazon must be left with a ton of this, and put it on the bottom-of-the-page deal section. A big gamble... could be a great deal, though. Feelin' lucky?"
1,Exactly,"How is anyone supposed to determine if this is a deal if there is no weight given? I know what I pay in the grocery store for a 4 ounce bag. If these are 4 ounce bags, there is no deal here!"
5,Must read for fraud investigators,"This text is the best high level review of the national health care fraud issue out there. It gives the first time health care fraud professional the basics. It is somewhat dated in 2006, but nevertheless a very informative read on the subject."
5,Just what I wanted,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend for valentines day and she loved it! It is huge and seems to be well made. This was well with the price!
4,One ecstatic grandson,"We were concerned about negative reviews, but found them to be exaggerated.Very pleased with the product, but not nearly as pleased as our grandson, who adores German Shepherds."
5,Mozart Later Symphonies,"The book is excellent, and well suited to college level work. The text is clear and clean and room is sufficient for making notes."
2,Missing Lots of Pages,The product came in good condition but it was missing completely Symphony No. 39 and part of Symphony No. 40. It was very disappointing but what do I expect for a used score.
5,"Hot, sexy, smart","This is a great book - hot stories, some even funny and still sexy, beautiful poems, excellent writing. I like the mix of hetero and gay and romantic and kinky stories - very unusual, very high quality."
4,Good single but overkill of 'the distance',Its 1999 with prolonging the magic out and 'the distance is still being flogged here with a standard lp version and the video!However you get a live version of you part the waters which sounds delightful much like all the other live songs on the prolonging the magic singles.This song alone bumps it up to 3 stars.
3,A good beginner's guide to costume creation,"A very basic book for the beginner seamstress looking to make their first belly dance costume. Good breakdown of subjects including how to design a costume that will suit each dance/dancer and the techniques needed to acheive the goal. The next book in the series (Bedlah, Baubles and Beads) includes all of this information and adds more detailed information.Excellent resources listed at the back of the book, too."
2,Chintzy materials mar OK content,"... Yes, it does clearly say ""spiral bound"" in the description- but it doesn't say that the book starts to fall apart the first time you turn the pages!The content is pretty good. Maybe I've just read too much on the subject- but I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. The belt patterns in the back are nice, though.If you've created belly dance costumes for the stage, this book is probably not going to give you any ideas you haven't already come up with yourself or seen on other dancers."
2,Costuming from the Hip .by Barry Brown,"a very good scource/reference book[let],more of it would have been good,as was bit thin on pages, but still an exellent ideas book with drawings & explanations easy to understand, i liked it."
5,Impress your family and friends with the best burgers anywhere.,"This book is the best. Short recipies, most on only one page complete with an introduction to the recipe, accompaniments, serving suggestions, tips and resources for hard to find ingredients this book has it all. This is a collection of recipes from some of the greatest burger restaurants in the country like, P.J. Clarke's, Hut's Hamburgers, Mel's Drive-In and so many more. Wether you love beef, pork, veal, lamb, turkey, chicken or duck, you got the best recipies at your fingers. Legal Seafoods Tuna Burger, is ""to die for"" and it's here along with other fish, crab, lobster scallops and shrimp favorites. Veggie burgers never tasted better. This book is a must have for anyone that loves to cook, entertain and eat."
2,An Amateur's Guide to Paris,"This was a very disappointing book. The author squandors a wealth of experiences in an amateur, superficial guide which ought to be entitled, ""How to Adjust to Being an American Who Insists on Thanksgiving Turkey and Who Cannot Master French While Living in Paris."" She needs professional writing lessons, especially in grammar and punctuation. The book does not have a major publisher; one can only speculate as to how many publishers rejected this schoolgirlish look at how the author spent eight lazy years in Paris while her husband worked at a responsible job. Don't waste your money."
1,NO TITLE,This is not a review. I would like to retract my earlier review. I have had second thoughts about the quality of this book. Please therefore eliminate my review Breathless in Paris from your web site. Thank you.
3,Interesting tale but not well told,"Although I enjoyed the book overall because I love Paris, I felt this was very poorly written. The author just tries too hard to grab your attention. In my opinion, the book is way over-priced for a large paperback; try to find it at your local library - it's worth a read, but I can't see myself reading it a second time."
2,Wrong title,"I agree with the introduction and the first part of the book ""History of Computer Chess"" (About 18 pages). But then, The author spends 2/3 of the book trying to explain how to beat your computer! Only a minimal part tries to explain what the title says: ""How to use Computers to Improve your Chess"". Even then, there's nothing realy valuable on those pages worth your time and money. Nothing new for a common and average database and playing program user, nothing you already know or cannot find out with a little common sense. If the title were ""How to beat your Chess Playing Program"" (Which is what the book should've been named), I would've given it 2 1/2 stars. Do yourself a favor, enjoy a latte at Borders and browse through the book, put it back on the shelf and you are done with it."
1,cd,when i got the cd it wasn't what i ordered from them. but the cd i got from them was in excellent condition.
4,"If you have the first, you need the second","If you liked ""take me out of the bathtub"" you'll like this one too. maybe not ""read"" on the same night as the first, but certainly both could go along on a car trip or a camping trip and you could get a lot of milage out of the two.As a trained singer I've been shocked to hear ""stop singing!"" from my children. They NEVER say that about these songs, thankfully and will even sing along with me.The lyrics are funny- and the illustrations fit the sprawling ""kid look"". It often helps to hum the ""real"" song before launching into the parody since the tune can often be wiped from memory- maybe it's fear when the melody sees what's going to be done to it. :-Pthese songs are great fun for me and my kids. The cats even stick around for some rousing renditions."
3,Good bath time fun,"This was the second silly dilly songs cd I purchased for my 3yr old niece. She loves it. I personally like the first ""Take me out of the bathtub"" cd better. The songs on ""I'm still here in the bathtub"",are to the same tunes as the first cd. I would recommend this cd if you already have the first one and the kids are tired of the same old songs."
4,front porch blues,"all original tunes,if you love blues with just a guitar and harmonica this cd is for you. cd contains songs about love and hate and real life stories"
3,Horse book??,"I read this book for the horsey elements! I have not yet finished it, but so far it is good. I do recomend it."
3,A Good Book,"In the book Taming the Star Runner Travis ,a boy, is sent to his uncle's house. He was sent there because he was like a criminal at his old house. He attempted to kill his step-father, drinks, and has friends that are doing weed. Travis is a cool guy and he finds that the school he goes to while at his uncle's doesn't care about being cool. He doesn't make a lot of friends but he finds love in a jockey at his father's old ranch. The jockey, Casey, has a wild horse called Star Runner. Travis soon finds out that he and Star Runner are just not meant to be tamed."
3,Taming the Star Runner,"I think that Taming the Star Runner was a good book. I like the way Travis acted. He acted like he was cool. I think you should read this book because it's just like a normal kid's life. It's about a kid that gets in trouble with his family and, has to go live with his uncle. He has too get use to living in the country and dose not fit in. He meets a lot of new friends and meets new people. So I think you should read it because a lot of exiting things happen, and it's a good book."
2,"Good plotline, but its end was unsatisfying","This was a great book, and I really liked how it progressed, but at the end everything stopped way too abrubtly. It was almost like S.E. Hinton wanted to kill off all her characters, but settled with ending a blossoming relationship, killing a horse, and taking a person's newfound view on life and destroying it. I think that the end of a book is the most important part, and this one left me unsatisfied and angry at the author."
3,It's Not So Bad but Not Great!,"S.E. Hinton struck gold with ""The Outsiders"" about a group of misfit boys in Oklahoma in the 1960s. This book is not great but it's not so bad or unreadable. Travis is one of those city boys who comes to the country with hopes and dreams of becoming a famous writer.During his time in the country, he is out working with horses and meeting people who don't live in the city. It's sort of taking a fish out of water. Anyway, the plot is thin and not much really happens up until the end. It's not a difficult read but not memorable neither. But for S.E. Hinton fans, it's worth reading to show another slice of American life for teens."
4,Taming The Star Runner,"Travis is a violent kid he lashes out on his stepfather with a fire poker and got arrested as well as banished from his home leaving him a newcomer on his uncle's ranch. He will stay till the next summer with his uncle and his cousin Chris. Travis will experience a whole new life style. None of the people there will respect him if he keeps his city style going. Along his way Travis finds a new friend Casey, who runs riding lessons at the ranch.""When life becomes hard don't give up hope keep on striding to achieve your goal."""
5,Taming the Star Runner,"Taming the star runner was a great book it was about this young teen who was geting in trouble with the law to much so his mom sent him to his uncle's. He emediatly did not fit in to much with his new fangled city ways so he had to ajust to the new hick population. He soon became very fimiler with this new world of isolation so he had to go find something to do with his self. Eventually he found some teens his age but was quickly asumed to be an city boy know it all, and to come crawling back to get their attention and there friend ship. Soon he found his pasion for horses and feel in love with a hick horse rider (a girl) who he had to win over with his boyish charm. He also feel in love with a horse who was named The Star Runner. Who was said to be in untameable by man but only by god himself. But in the end the star runner was to be tamed by the lovely horse rider girl who also tamed the untamable Nick."
3,Taming the Star Runner,"Taming the Star runner is about Travis, A sixteen year old boy who is sent to his uncles farm after trying the kill his stepfather. There he finds that he is'nt noticed at school for the first time in his life. Travis is hired by casey as a stable hand were he meets a horse named star runner. Casey is trying to tame him, But Star Runner is like Travis, not ment to be tamed. I did't fully understand the ending of the book and it was a bit too long, but other than that the book was very good."
3,"A good book, originally.","This could have been an amazing children's book. It had everything: great characters, a wonderful plot....but I did not enjoy the swearing, Personally, after Outsiders and That was then, this is now, I expected much better language from Hinton. I cannot recommend this book for anyone who doesn't like swearing every five words."
5,Great book!!,"""Taming the Star Runner"" was awesome! I loved every minute of it, even if it wasn't challenging or long. To make it longer would have dragged it out too much. The plot was interesting (especially since it was about horses!!) I first read ""The Outsiders"" in school and fell in love with S. E. Hinton's books. I couldn't never even imagine trying to get a book published when i was 16!! I did notice a lot of similarities between the two books (same quotes and character portrayl, things like that).I recommend this book highly!"
4,Over to soon,"This was over all a good book. I thought it was over to soon and not all in a good way. The climax of the story happens to quickly and after there is a hasty conclusion like SE Hinton was in a hurry to finish it. The story was good though and I still enjoyed the book.The question ""What If?"" plays a big part in the story. We all ask that-What if i had... whould things have been better? They would have been different but if we had chosen the other option we would still be sitting around wondering what if. Learn to make the choice you want and move on. We can't change the past so look to the future."
4,Triumph,"A superbly paced book that accurately details the problems facing adolescents today...Hintons work covers such diverse problems as teenage love, family breakdown and juvenile crime. The main character, Travis, is funny and very realistic in his portrayal. Great read."
4,Juveniles--continue to do the wrong thing at the right time!,"Yes, S.E. Hinton hit the nail on the head again regarding young people of our time as she shares the misadventures of Travis. Travis is a young man wanting to avoid trouble while tempting fate.He loves, even cultivates, the bad guy image, but needs love and acceptance. Travis gets an honest second chance with his Uncle Ken. He travels to a new environment and learns that his life style isn't as acceptable as he had once thought. In fact, he even begins to doubt his own good looks. Much needed love is found on the ranch--also self examination reveals hurtful flaws. The driving force behind Travis is his endeavors in writing. Writing nearly causes him to murder his step father and at the same time provides an avenue of escape. Travis shares his ""two faces"" as he learns to fit into the ranch scene. Travis--the juvenile delinquent or published novelist?"
1,U.S. Border Patrol NOT,"I bought this book because of the title and the cover art, both of which are somewhat misleading. The book has nothing to do with the U.S. Border Patrol or any realistic law enforcement. I assume that the science is accurate -- the author claims to be a medical laboratory technician -- but little else is even close to accurate. It is quite obvious that the author knows nothing about law enforcement, U.S. immigration policy, or alien smuggling. The book is full of inaccuracies that could easily have been corrected with a minimum of research."
5,seemingly wild open-mindedness towards religious doctrine,"Hick's Philosophy of Religion, a thin volume of analytic philosophy, actually changed my life. Having been staunchly raised as a naive but bright member of a General Association of Regular Baptist church, I picked up Hick's Philosophy of Religion in a used bookstore (Bookseller's Row) in Chicago in 1990. Its rational, deliberative approach combined with a seemingly wild open-mindedness towards religious doctrine was what cracked opened the worlds of religion, philosophy, history, and literature to an impressionable college student. Later that year, I would echo one of Hick's arguments in a question to philosopher Richard Swinbourne, whose predictable Oxfordian condescension did the opposite of discouraging me."
1,A setback for students of the subject.,"This book took an overly simplistic approach to the issues at hand. Often times, truth is sacrificed at the altar of understanding. This is a severely watered down version of the issues. This will not deepen the understanding when it comes to philosophy of religion."
1,just awful,"just awfulsave your money, this book is not worth it. The pictures are dull and lifeless, boring composition. Mann hasn't captured anything here but a bunch of worthless photos. Any 10th rate amateur photographer could have done better."
4,Nice photography,"I found the technical aspect of this work to very pleasing. I don't find the composition itself to be as good Sturges, but all in all this is a nice piece of work. that being said, I do really like Sally Mann's work. This particular material was not as compelling to me as some of her other work."
2,Not what you might expect,"While the black-and-white photography is as beautiful as one might expect from an experienced professional, those who have viewed the work of David Hamilton or Jock Sturges will be disappointed at the subject matter."
2,Lacking Depth,"Although I realise that Mlle. Mann is seeking to confine her subject matter as the title suggests, I don't find it broke any ground in the field of photography. She tends to focus on ""real people"" under real conditions, but this has been done before."
4,A Good Adventure Tale,"1. This is a book about the legendary Robin Hood and his giant of a friend Little John who is a friendly giant. They capture a knight who is a mercenary, that joins Robin Hood and help rescue a damsel in distress.2. I think it is a very good book if you like adventure type books of medieval times. I liked very much because of all the fighting with swords, bows and knives in the forest.3. The climax of the story is that Red roger keeps trying to find little john and the princess, and all the while thier hiding from him and the sheriff. The climax is the big moment the high point or the finale.4.This a very good adventure type book from the midieval times. The reason I gave it a four is that it is a very interesting book about fantasy fiction."
4,Yummy!,"Received in good time as with everything we buy :)Was expecting a large box, instead 5 medium size boxes of 32 bars eachWas a little disappointed that only 3 flavors were included - Apple Crisp, Strawberry and raspberry Swirl. Would have been nice to get a selection of all flavors listedStill a great deal! Nice and fresh and these babies are going to last a LONG time!"
5,Wifey,"This song has to be sweetest up tempo song with respect to marriage. It's not saying ""we might as well get married because we've been together so long"" (like another well known song does). It is saying I want you for my wife, your the only one for me, you make me feel good...and so on. It is truly refreshing to have a song this good, with good singing, good music, and also attractive men! My hat goes off to NEXT!MizLove"
3,"Good, Quick Read worth the time","Read this book in the 80's, curious if it would be as good as the movie. It wasn't as near as exciting, but just as entertaining.I was surprised the movie didn't mention Billy Hayes 1st attempted escape; it would have been great movie material- Hayes' description formed vivid mental images that would have been great low-light film sequences.His final escape to Greece was much more interesting than the movie's little jump dance in the Turkish streets.Anyway neither the book or the movie disappoint. It is a classic of the prison-genre, of the human spirit, and of good ol' survival.It is not on the scale of Papillion, and should never be compared to that work... Papillion is unique, kind of untouchable really."
2,All exaggeration,"Both the book and the film is full of exaggeration, revenge and hatred towards Turkey and Turks. Only 30-40% of the story may be true which I am pretty sure would also be the same in many countries 36 years ago. All the rest is full of lies. But portraying one of the worlds most interesting and beautiful city like it was is a real shame and pitty. I am a Greek living in Athens who visits Istanbul and beaches at the south of Turkey with my family at least twice a year and know what I am talking about. I don't know anyone who was in jail but dealt with police a few times and everyone was always nice and very helpful especiallyy to foreigners."
1,What a boring pile of slush,"It's incredible that this yankee brat likened this drivel of book to Papillon, one of the greatest books ever. How dares he, this spoilt NY brat who couldn't figure out if to smoke hash or pot or be gay or not.It's one of the worst books ever! It has nothing to do with Papillon at all!It's a diary of a whiner, a naive primitive, spoilt American, and a criminal brat.Let's face it, he did attempt to smuggle and he was a drug user. There's no way around it!Papillon is a march towards grace and soul freedom over elements and hurdles of life told in the most adventurous style. This lowly tale is a strife of a spoilt New Yorker, who never once had to work in his life and had everything handed to him on a platter. His tribulations are of personal nature only second guessing his sexuality and penchant for drug abuse. Nothing in the book makes for good reading. It's of no spiritual or uplifting value."
5,counting down..........,"this is the follow up to rust in piece and megadeth's evolution into the mainstream metal that many a band has done, most notably, metallica's black album. it starts off with a bang with skin o' my teeth, which is a great song, one of the best on the album. next is symphony of destruction, which was the first megadeth song i ever heard. another stand out track is sweating bullets. its basically dave just being himself, aka a nut. awesome song and one of my favorites. all songs on here are solid, captive honour and psychotron standing out for me, but the last song, ashes in your mouth, is probly the best on the disc. perfect song. the album started with a bang, and ends with one too. a change for megadeth but a good one at that. the next album would continue this new sound, and continue it well...overall, great cd if youre a megadeth fan, must have. not thrash, but still a good metal release."
4,amazing guitar work,dave mustaine and marty friedman have written not only good riffs but virtuosic solos as well the best solo is on ashes in your mouth where friedman has on then mustaine the they have a duet it may seem weird but its awesome this is a good megadeth album to start with i say that because this was my first megadth album
5,Megadeth at their peak of popularity.,Countdown kind of reminds me of part 1 to Youthanasia to me the songs are somewhat similar but that's cool. This is the album that put Megadeth on the map for superstardom and on regular Mtv playings. 2 million sold #2 on the charts was a shock when this came out. It just comes to show you that Megadeth can out last alot of the metal bands of the 80's. 15 years together and their still selling albums. Progression is the key to success. To Megadeth it is without losing that metal sound. I respect you guys. Killer Album! BUY IT!
4,its still growing on me...,"quite frankly, metallica can change their musical style and still sound pretty good, dont know why, probly cuz james hetfields voice is about 100 times better than dave mustaines. this is why megadeth should have stayed a thrash band, because the driving beats, thunderous bass and speeding guitars overshadowed mustaines mediocre voice. not to say mustaines lyrics and stuff suck, just that he doesnt have the best voice. esp on ""sweating bullets"". but anyway thats my only real beef with this album. this doesnt compare at all with RIP or PSBWB, but it gets the job done. i havent picked up TSHF yet, i probly will soon."
3,I have heard better,There is some good songs on this album but they don't really live up to the Megadeth standard.The sound is very good and the good songs lyrics are very deep.Buy it if you what to
3,"yeah, it's okay","""eh."" That was my reaction to hearing ""Countdown"". There is some good guitar work, but it was all but ruined for me by Mustaine's annoying vocals. When he's not trying to sound like James Hetfield on ""Skin o' Teeth"" he sounds downright whiny. I wish he had just shut up and the whole album had been instrumental. And Megadeth never seemed to go off on this album. The music is very good, but they never reach the point where the just go off and ROCK. Every time they seem about to, Mustaine breaks back in and the music goes back to average riff work. Also...what is this thing with competing with Metallica? Machine Guns in a song intro? I think Mustaine has some sort of inferiority complex or something. Anyway, ""Countdown"" is all right. Metal but mindless, fun but forgetable."
5,One of the GREATEST Megadeth CDs ever!,"Megadeth's 5th album to date is definitely one of the best albums ever; with great songs like the speedy High Speed Dirt to a SLIGHTLY lower paced song like the title track Countdown To Extinction. Ever since I've heard this album, I've been a mega hardcore fan of their music. Their genre is unique, combining heavy metal with rock and hard rock. If your a fan of monsterous jammies, be SURE to pick this hit up; the Megadeth CD ""Rust In Peace"" is also suggested for those who liked Countdown To Exctinction."
2,Yikes!!!,"I dig ""The System has Failed"" so much that I've been in a real Megadeth mood lately...so today I wanted to listen to ""Countdown..."", but I couldn't find my original. ""Hey"", I thought, ""I'll just check out the re-master"". I kinda wish I hadn't. It just sounds weak...""Symphony"" sounds gross and thin, with the vocals sounding strange and the drums too up front. I've only gotten through half the album...I thought the demos were interesting though-the ""Countdown to Extinction"" demo being a much different version than that which ended up on the album.Lately I've just been realizing that ""re-master"" does not necessarily equal ""real good"". Purchase if you're curious, but do yourself a favor and hang on to the original-it really is a totally different experience......we all know metal sounds best on cassette anyway."
2,I've heard much better,I used to have this CD and it got old fast when I bought Peace Sells and Rust in Peace. Those 2 albums killed Countdown. This is the decline of Megadeth. It's when they started playing the Cryptic Writings sound they have now. I thought it wasn't bad at first but after a while I got sick of it. Not recommended if you want Megadeth for the 1st time.
5,Loud and In Your Face,"This is easily Megadeth's best album. The tunes rock, not a single clunker here. The bass is heavy and the music just begs to be cranked up. Oh, and if you listen to the lyrics there is a pretty heavy societal collapse message too. You won't go wrong with this one!"
3,Remastering doesn't sound right.,In the original recordings it sounds as if everyone is playing and being recorded at once like a live show. But on this the vocals sound added in after the music was recorded and have a layered feel.
3,Dave's a big fibber.,"Beware! If you have the original recording of this album, do not --repeat--DO NOT get rid of it. While it's stated on the case that it was remixed and remastered, it's become obvious to me that certain parts have been re-recorded as well. I can't speak for the vocal or guitar parts but the drum tracks, I'm fairly certain, have all been re-recorded. I'm a drummer with incredibly sensitive ears. I'm also intimately familiar with Nick Menza's work on this album (great work, too) and I can say without hesitation that he's not the person who played on this remix. Whoever it was is pretty good at imitating him but not perfect. I'm not sure why Dave would do this--maybe he wasn't able to get the sound he wanted from the original tracks. Whatever. Nice try, Dave. Download the extra songs off of I-tunes or something but avoid the rest of this one and find the original."
5,Megadeth Sells Out... And I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way!,"The Megadeth album that kicked the MTV culture in the teeth and made it take notice. Sure, it's more 'pop' than Rust In Peace and Peace Sells, but who wants these guys to be stuck in the same place forever? It starts out great with Skin O' My Teeth: Great opening, awesome lyrics. Symphony of Destruction is the Megadeth riff probably everyone will remember, and it was somewhat immortalized in one of the earliest episodes of Beavis and Butthead. Sweating Bullets and Captive Honour shows Dave Mustaine in all his corny glory. (Captive Honour sounds like something you'd see at a Styx-like concert.) The chorus of Architecturer of Agression is like stuffing a brick into a small paper cup, and Dave does it well. A great CD."
5,Album mastered by its nature,"I have all the albums up to date of this Megadeth band and Mustane's voice has made the band to reach at the highest postion now., I would like Megadeth visiting Chennai - India and playing a live show in future."
5,strong album,"This album shows a more mature, and heavy megadeth. From the begining there is the fast guitars of ""skin of my teeth"" followed by ""countdown to extinction"" a melodic song about the disapearence of species. The album is followed by Architecture of agression a song about US bombing of iraq, and then ""foreclosure of a dream"" one of the best songs on the album with strong guitar and drums. The album looses a little speed near the end with songs like ""pyschotron"" or ""high speed dirt"" that are weak lyrically, but picks up in the end with the song ""ashes in your mouth."""
5,Very cool remastered edition,"This was the album that was going to put Megadeth on the map. New fans hopped on and the songs were mainstream(for MD at the time)enough for the masses to accept it.Very crisp and clear tight sound. Well done again Dave. This edition rocks. A few things different, new riffs emerge from the back of the old mixes and enhances the feel. I used to hate the title track for some reason or another. Now I can't get enough of it.And ofcourse the bonus tracks are always a treat."
2,Megadeth goes MTV - with mixed results,"This is the album where Dave Mustaine decided to make Megadeth MTV/radio friendly, and frankly, the previously aggressive Megadeth suffered heavily. Only one track (""Symphony of Destruction"") captures the feel of Megadeth's masterpiece ""Peace Sells .. But Who's Buying?"", while the rest is a not-so-coy attempt to make Megadeth more acceptable to the MTV generation.Gee whiz Mr. Mustaine, wasn't ""Peace Sells"" an ironic comment on the vapid generation of Americans spoon fed information and entertainment on television? If this album was a savage parody of metal bands selling out, give it four stars. As it is, it's going to have to get by with two from me."
4,Not Bad,"Not as good as Rust in Peace. They seem to slow down and take an alteranative from thrash metal. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a good album. My favorite tracks are Skin o'My Teeth, Symphony of Destruction, Sweating Bullets, Foreclosure of a Dream and This was my life. This album is like their black album. Nonetheless, I love this album and if you're a Megadeth fan, then you should get it."
3,False Advertising,"False Advertising - this is NOT the - ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING - it's a remix by dave mustane and it sounds like it's mixed by a guitarist. the original mix i feel is far superior to this reattempt. to bad mobile fidelity went with this and not the ""original master recording"". other than that it's a high quality 180g quiet pressing."
4,another great Megadeth album,"I've been a big Megadeth fan since KIMB, have seen Mustaine in concert, and own all of the Megadeth releases to date (as of 2006. The only Remaster version I have is of MD45, of which I have the original version and the remaster.)Countdown is one of my favorites, rivialing the first 3 releases of KIMB, Peace, and So Far. It's a heavy metal album, but the songs also stick in your head and have catchy choruses and riffs. All in all another stellar CD from the Mustaine crew. I give it 4 stars because it's not quite up to par with KIMB or Peace Sells but it's still great. It's in my top 5 Megadeths for sure. Standout tracks include Skin of My Teeth, Symphony of Destruction, Foreclosure of a Dream, Sweating Bullets, and High Speed Dirt. I can listen to this CD from start to finish without skipping a track. If you are into Megadeth, this is a must have."
1,"""What is this.....?""","O.K. When I heard that Dave was going to remaster/re-release the Megadeth back catalog I got real excited. I still believe that this album is a true masterpiece, but when I bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version I was MORTIFIED!!!! What was Dave thinking when he decided to remix it. All it needed was to be beefed up just a little, but he went to great extremes to ruin it. I know Megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this, but the one thing I did remember is that the first time I heard Countdown... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills........period! I have regrets about buying all the remasters at once.......BIG MISTAKE!!! So in closing I went back and found the original versions of So Far...So Good...So What!, Rust in Peace, and of course Countdown to Extinction, and yes Capitol Punishment...The Megadeth Years. I'm glad that I was able to locate them."
2,NO SURPRISE,"No doubt this is a good metal album. But,a swith all others MEGADETH's releases, along the middle of it you can't handle Mustaine's awful vocals any longer. So you stop and listen to the rest of the album later. Friedman's solos are also boring, plain flat and rough, no feeling at all. The good parts are the lyrics and the rhythm guitars. All in all, a good effort, but it should not have eleven tracks. Eight would do it..."
3,tripleplay is really just a double,I intend to ask for a refund. I bought this new and the quality of Working Girl was very poor. A blue screen kept appearing and the colors changed throughout the film so much that I felt I was looking at an Andy Warhol version of the actors. Maybe it was just a fluke but I am surprised as I have never experienced any problems with any past purchases from Amazon.Alec Baldwin Triple Feature (Malice / Miami Blues / Working Girl)
5,Very Cajun!!,"Being a Cajun, I really enjoy seeing the old recipes in this book. The spices are true to form for ""Cajun"" cooking. Easy to use instructions. We use mostly spices grown in our garden. The pictures are so pretty. I have made most of these dishes and they are wonderful! I suggest any person wanting to have a real taste of Cajun food they give this book a try. It is a must for any Cajun or wantabe Cajun kitchen."
1,Zero stars,"How the hell this got on my mailing list for my online movie club, I don't know. Though if it wasn't me, it could only have been my son. (He denies it.)Shot on video, convoluted, confusing, etc... etc... etc...I have seen shot on video amateur efforts before that have impressed me. Not this piece of junk. Worse than any ""film student"" effort I've ever seen, this was just a waste of time even though I barely watched it.Skip it. Seriously. Waste of time that you will regret. The only reason I took the time to write this review is because no one else has.Stay away."
5,Keeps me organized,This is the best bag I've ever bought. It keeps me organized while planning to go to crops. It's great because it has a lot of space for all of the things that you need and you even looks stylish while carrying it! The fabric is waterproof and stain resistant so cleaning is a breeze. Every scrapbooker should have one.
5,AWSOME!!,"The Clark Sisters' video is excellent, as a matter of fact, anything by the them are worth listening to. They are annointed by God and can truely lift your spirits. I have been following their ministry for a very long time, and each time they get better and better with the help of God. Baby sister, Karen, is the hottest one now being used by God. Karen is a must see (video) and must hear (CD). I promise you won't be disappoointed if you love the Gospel through song! Buy their music, and be blessed!!"
4,Stunning Translation,"This book was brought to my attention as a student of translation. I think that it is indeed a remarkable novel for a variety of reasons. Although a specialist on the history of this era might not be satisfied with the quantity of historical detail presented, I did not feel like the story itself was sacrificed for the purpose of allegory. The key aspects of the story were the act of presenting a story, in itself -- the language was sumptuous and the arabic translation was breathtaking. Descriptions were fabulously drawn. My impression of the novel was that it gently creates an allegory, while more importantly reiterating that people who live in an insular culture are always slow to change. I thought this book might be well received by Americans, who generally are not aware that the rest of the world does not move as quickly as they do, and who are not prepared to deal with too much character depth or historical detail."
2,not a historical novel!,"I just finished this book for a class on modern arab lit that I absolutely loved. This book is meant as an alegorical statement of the experience of loss and defeat by ""outsiders"" so dominant in Arab consciousness, so it shouldn't really be read as a historical novel. But there is something disappointing about the lack of nuance in character development and depth in the story it tells (in fact, it reads a bit like an adolescent novel). It's too bad, because Ashour is a lyrical writer and the subject is a serious one. If you are looking for some serious fiction by women writers from the Arab world, I strongly recommend Huda Barakat and Sahar Khalifeh (Wild Thorns is a classic about why people in Palestine resort to violence even when they abhor it in principle)."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This book was a pleasure to read at first thanks to Ashur's wonderful descriptions of everyday things and her ability to bring the scene alive. But as the story develops, I couldn't help but feel that the author was stereotyping her characters to make an all too predictable ideological point, and that was disappointing. The female heroine seems to have no flaws, a feminist twist, but at the expense of any sense of complexity in the story. There is also an akward sense of insularity to the novel. ""Christians"" do not enter the story at all except as villains and inquisitors, a one dimensional world that seems to have much in common with the demonized view of Arabs so prevalent in the US, only turned on its head. Too bad, because Ashur is clearly an accomplished writer. Her agenda simply dominates the story, producing an overly simplistic account of the human tragedy she seeks to describe."
3,"Hardly ""Essential""","The title of this CD is very misleading. Except for ""I Never Knew Lonely"" & maybe ""Oklahoma Borderline"", none of his real hits are here. Not that these songs are bad at all, it's just that there are much better places to start your Vince collection."
4,Right size to get the point across to the recipient...,"This book has some of the most heartfelt, friendship poems and quotes and puts them on pages of sweet artwork for the young at heart. I like the size of the book because it is an easy read (fairly short), but gets the point across of expounding on just what friends are for, how we need one another, and how we should treat one another. It's a lovely gift book for your closest friends and don't forget to buy one for yourself!...(I do wish the cost was about half the price though)."
3,Derelict Falleen (spoilers),"Good Work! The Jedi basically go to Falleen, where omega is rumoured to appear. Then Omega captures Anakin and Jenna requests a meeting and states the rendezvous point. The book ends with- Hold on, Anakin. We'll find you."
2,Book of Mormon Fiction for the Latter-day Saint reader,"The authors have been studying the Book of Mormon, and have come up with the idea that the Nephites were never completely destroyed by the native Americans (Lamanites), but sailed off to Japan and intermarried with the people there. As soon as the people of Japan find out their real heritage, they will come to America to build the New Jerusalem in Jackson Missouri. The Lamanites, can join in on the building if they wish, but the promises of Christ are that the Nephites (Japanese) will be building the New Jerusalem. The authors make the presentation of their ideas more interesting by putting them in the form of fiction. The title itself tries to remind you that this is a novel and not just a series of lectures. The effect this book had on me: I want to read The Book of Mormon again, this time more carefully, with a view of prophecies of my day."
1,808M Mixer,"If you have a circuit board needs to be replaced , Mackie has no repair parts for this mixer, so why would you buy anything Mackie any longer, I am an actual customer who paid a lot for a mixer amp and paid the diagnostic fee of $89 to an authorized repair shop, then was told there are no parts to fix, loss of $700. Adrian"
3,Who is the audience for this book?,"I bought this book (and returned it). Keep in mind, I didn't read it, I just skimmed it over. But I figured others might want to know that there wasn't much in the way of information on how an individual investor should attack his/her taxes. It was a book more focused on the ""big picture"" of how capital gains taxes effect our economy.Perhaps this book is more suited for an economics student."
3,Great How To,"This is a great book for ""how to"" create tribal gear without having to be a sewing guru! Finally nice simple way of making tassles!"
4,Useful!,One of the more concise information sources on tribal costuming - focusing on construction and sources.
4,Can History Repeat?,"In 1966, the Republicans made great advances in the midterm elections. By 1968 with the country tired of war, civil unrest, crime and economic uncertity, US Representative Melvin Laird (Soon to be Secretary of Defense)edited the thoughts of the best Republican thinkers of what should be done to make the country run better. Particuarly relevent is Moyihan's critique of the liberal welfare state, and the young Dr. Marvin Esch's (Michigan professor turned congressman)proposals for reform of Congress.This book is a good read not only for its historical reference but also for any who contemplate the social and ecomomic issues confronting the country today."
4,Surprisingly Amusing,Hard to put down. She weaves her tales with recipes for oysters in such a way as to be thoroughly entertaining and which results in the inevitable desire to eat oysters.
5,Pure Chaos,"I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this disc, and it was well worth it. It comes on like an attak and leaves you beggin for more. It had great beats and SKOLDS vocals are intense... My personal favorite track would have to be ""Anything"" it made me wonder if these were really Skolds views or if he just wanted to hear his audiance chanting these words back at him?"
5,A musical mastermind,"Skold is a musical mastermind on par with such greats as David Bowie and Trent Reznorthis album is his crowning achivment better than his KMFDM stuff better than his Shotgun Messiah stuff and better than his work with Manson, all of which are geniuse in my opinion. I would also recomend his new allbum Dead God if you can find it is difficult considering it was never released"
5,WONDERFUL!,"As with every CD Tim Skold plays for, it always comes out extremely wonderful in my mind. Tim Skold is a very talented person and I can't wait to find more of his stuff!Note: if you are a big Tim Skold fan (like I am!) I suggest checking out KMFDM's album, ""Attak."" Tim Skold helped with this album and it turned out very, very good."
1,tom jones 2 cd import,"piece of junk re-record. not the original songs. a real rip off. beware of these re-records, or so called new stereo recordings by the artist. there was no warning of this at time of purchase."
3,"if you're a horror fan,it's worth a viewing...","this low budget insane asylum flick isn't too horrible..not as gory as you'd expect from the box and all that..there's a small twist which I figured out in the first 15 minutes and I'm sure most people will..the name of the movie is pretty pointless since there's no mention of a basement til the last couple minutes and what's inside isn't all that surprising..still this movie isn't too horrible and if you love b-movies,you should atleast check it out.."
3,Don't Do This or That,"Another film in the long line of ""don't"" do this or don't do that. This particular film, however, is a finely crafted example of early 70s horror. It is a twisted, macabre foray into the world of psychiatric institutions, where one is unable to make a distiction between sanity and insanity. The film is very crude in its depiction, but maintains the roots of exploitation horror. Do not expect quality acting, effects or sets, and you will enjoy the twisted storytelling. The DVD is adequate with few flaws other than a scratchy source print. For a film of this caliber, it is presentd in the best condition available. I recommend this film to fans of early 70s institutionalized horror. If you liked ""Don't Open The Window"" or ""Alone In The Dark"", you will enjoy this."
4,A classic Drive-In horror flick!,"At long last, Brownrigg's masterstroke 'Don't Look in the Basement' is available. This is the one set in the mental hospital, where all the inmates go (even more) nuts, and start killing everything that moves.This is a nice uncut transfer, with plenty of detail, and few weak spots (considering the old 1973 prints available previously). The whole package looks fantastic due to some arresting cover art, and the disc has a very nice interactive menu screen, through which you can access the usual stuff. No trailer is included, but we get to chance to savour some other trailers for horror films forthcoming from VCI. See their website for more info on these.So, at the end of the day, should you buy this? Well, if you're a fan of this film, or indeed any stupid B-movie, then this is definitely for you. It's good to see that VCI have released the uncut version. As I said, it's a crisp, clean print, nice sound and as much gore as you would expect."
3,Don't Look In the Basement for quality acting!,"Many others have complained that Diamond Entertainment, that released this DVD, that there is lots of ""over acting"". Sure, the acting is close to that of your average 70's adult movie (and looks it too), it's not that horrible...The transfer is so-so, but the original source materials I betcha are not too great. Heck, for the price...It's allright! It's not awesome, but it's OK!"
4,"""Oh Sam....she is so sick""--Dr. Masters","The first time I saw this film was at a drive-in in the late 1970s! What a trip! ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is one of my favorite trash films: over-the-top acting, hilarious dialogue, gore and a freaky soundtrack."
1,Woefully mediocre,"This film was actually on the original video nasties list in the UK, but after watching it you'll wonder why. It is a very low budget film about an asylum where the inmates take contol. There are many diverse crazies inside, and the ending is the only real gory bit of the film. It ends up being silly, and can't escape its cheapness. The DVD is poor. The picture is below average. The sound in mono is a little muffled, but that's because of the age and budget of the film. The extras consist of interactive menus, some film facts and info on the director and screenwriter, and some previews of other films from the distribution company. Overall a poor film, it just looks so cheap and amateur, with a below average DVD transfer."
1,Throw this in the basement !!!,"I dont know if its because part of the film is missing, because this is only a full screen (Pan scan) version or if its just to ridiculous, but it just doesnt work for me at all! The gore scenes are just so fake and after years of watching movies since seeing this at a drive in, its just so fake it can only be considered a ""cult"" film. But then it just doesnt even fit into the ""cult"" catagory because there is nothing or no one in this film that is memorable, this is not a ""b"" movie it is a ""d"" movie. With all the entertainment vieing for your hard earned dollars, do you really need this lousy movie, and a full screen version at that?IF YOU WANT A SCARY OLD FILM I SUGGEST ""Last House On The Left"" or the Origional ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"""
1,It's hard for me to give 1 star,"I usually always find something in a movie of this kind that I will ike, but the only thing I enjoyed about this movie is how lovely the new nurse is. This movie is really bad!The gore is non-existent, despite what these other reviews might say and there is not a scary moment in the movie. It's also one of those movies that you have a hard time hearing anything that is being said, but every scream is extremly loud(and annoying).The acting is far subpar and the plot takes the entire movie to develop. The ending is a surprise, but not worht waiting for. I would recommend this movie, only if really bored or if like me, will watch anything that promises a scare(although this doesn't)"
2,"""An American Childhood"" That Lacks Climax","I feel sympathy for the author because of her lack of enthusiasm. This is a classic tale of a girls childhood and the hardships she experiences throughout her life. Her life continues as a normal childs would and has no turning point.While reading this novel you will notice that the author talks about her family on every page. This novel has its interesting moments however, this does not exist throughout the whole novel."
2,Didn't draw me in.,"I really liked the ethereal beginning but it got to be a bit much for me. It seemed melancholy and I have not finished it but Mini, a high-schooler's review, though a bit too harsh, about sums up my feelings thus far:""The author uses very obscure words and there is no story line. She jumps from one thing to another with no transitions, making the whole book a complete mess. She looses the point that she's trying to tell across in the weird metaphors and similes that are throughout the whole book. A reader cannot understand what the heck she's talking about when there's all these odd metaphors and similes."" -Mini"
3,An American Childhood,"Annie Dillard is a wonderful writer, and this book is a wonderful read for those who like the written language. Beautiful prose and imagery is the hallmark of Dillard's work, and this book is no exception. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of the way through, my interest in the subject waned."
2,omg,"had to read and do a report on this book. well is really boring and i can say that it took me forever to finish reading it. but i got an ""A"" on the report."
2,"""An American Childhood"" That Lacks Climax","I feel sympathy for the author because of her lack of enthusiasm.

3,"The Autobiographical Equivalent of ""Seinfeld"" ....",". . . because it fills up space but is really about nothing in particular. Not nearly as funny as ""Seinfeld."" So ""interior that I felt I was party to a psychotherapy session."
2,An American Childhood,"If I have ever read a book that I truly, truly didn't like, this would have to be it. The book is filled with overbearing descriptions that have little to do with the actual book, and the author rambles on and on about points that just weren't interesting to me. Also, for me, when I read a book, I read it to escape reality, not to bury myself deeper in it, which this book did. I didn't find the plot of it very interesting. I was bored by the time she was ten years old--the characters seemed flat and she jumped from point to point without connecting them. It seemed like just a jumble of random ideas pasted into chapters in a book. Even my English teacher did not like this book, nor did any of my friends. I do not recommend this book."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.............,"I had to read this book for an AP class, and it put me to sleep everytime i picked it up. The author rambles on about the same things that went on in her life throughout the whole book, and she adds the most pointless details and situations. The whole book is base don her views and opinions, so I really didn't care for it .If you don't want to go to the store to buy sleeping pills, just pick this one off the shelf and you will sleeping like a baby."
3,RANDOM...,"although a very interesting book, Annie Dillard's ""An American Childhood"" is very (and I mean very) random and boring. It seems to hop from one part of her childhood to the next, just boring the reader to death with what she did as a kid. There are some instances in the book that are amusing, but as a whole, it bored me to death. Therefore I recommend this book to someone who has alot of time on their hands, for they're going to need every precious second of it in order to get through this work."
5,As graceful a book as I have read,"Dillards' ""An American Childhood"" sings with vision:of the eye and the soul. She describes growingup in Pittsburgh in a loving family and remindsus of the many ways we come awake (if we arelucky and wise) as we cross through childhood.Never preachy and often funny, she exploresclass and religious differences, the discovery of thenatural world, of oneself and of the people inone's family. Each chapter is short and completein itself, so picking it up for a short read is easyand satisfying: a refreshing break every time. Onechapter begins, ""The interior life is often stupid.""This book never is"
2,blah,I am giving up after about a third of this book. It is too wordy (author trying too hard to create images where there is nothing to start from) and it does not have an interesting plot. Would definitely not recommend it to my book group or yours!
5,A pity about the AP abuse.,"I feel bad for the teenagers forced to read Dillard. Obviously their schools have made placement mistakes. The sophmoriphic and shallow reviews demonstrate that these young 'scholars' haven't yet developed the sensetivity their exhalted class suggests. Criticize Dillard, but do so on the merits of her work. She writes with breath stealing imagery and astonishing fluidity, not in a Dickens-like arch. It seems horribly unfair to both students and author to have to shove such beauty down the unwilling. Readers should consider themselves guests in a magical and all-too-familiar world. We are invited to look, touch, taste, and most enjoyably sit and listen for a spell."
2,"Anne Dillard is a good writer, but I could barely finish it.","I had to read this book, as an assignment. I found it extremely boring. I could barely finish it. I think Anne Dillard is a really great author, with a large vocabulary, but I think the story would be more entertaining if it was less descriptive of unimportant details. Maybe she should try writing fiction."
5,Americana Revisited,"I grew up in suburbia (Detroit area) about the same time as the author, and could identify with many of the positive (and a few negative) experiences so beautifully written about the Pittsburgh suburbs. I particularly enjoyed the little insights about the author's family, such as the competition to come up with the best jokes at the dinner table to the point of continually revising little details of the joke; and the fact that Ms. Dillard's father got a bit role as a scientist in Night of the Living Dead. In a world full of disaster and danger on the nightly news, it's nice to read a book centering on idyllic memories of growing up in a slightly more innocent time."
3,grew up in southwest Pennsylvania,I purchased this book because I grew up 50 miles south of Pittsburgh. In the first quarter of the book the author writes of many things I remember. The other 2/3s were just stories of her live. Not so interesting.
2,Dillard rambles on and on about the painfully mundane.,"This collection of literary snapshots from Dillard's childhood is made up of short passages that spotlight and explain her inner life, as well as the curious activities in which she engaged as a child. The book is filled with glorified, painstaking explanations and descriptions of the mundane. At times, it became difficult to trudge through certain parts of the book. Forced to read at least fifteen pages dedicated to rocks and minerals, I felt like a fifth grader studying a never-ending earth science assignment. Although some of her vignettes were interesting and insightful, too many were unnecessary and boringly specific."
2,Lexicon,"I don't relate at all to this ""American Childhood."" The author uses vocabulary that shows how many obtuse words she knows. This is not effective communication. I am well educated and would still have to look up many words which interrupts the flow of her story."
4,Amazing,I have been a fan of Apple my whole life and when this emac 1ghz came out I wanted one so bad.The emac 1ghz would roughly compare to a pentium 4 2.oghz.And they have also uped the graphics card and it's at a great price.So if you are looking for an inexpensive computer with great features and performance. Then the apple emac 1ghz is for you.
4,Pretty good computer for simple tasks,"I use it for browsing the web mostly, but i also use itunes. web browsing is not super slow but not zippy as modern macs. youtube is just horrible, you have to watch all videos on 240p (the lowest setting, bad video quality). i have downloaded ilife, iwork, microsoft office for mac, and halo. they take a little longer to start up, but run pretty good overall. i would recommend this for basic web browsing and some school work in powerpoint or word. overall, good computer but a little outdated."
2,Good for rank beginners,"This was the first Portuguese dictionary I owned. When I was learning Portuguese I had some Brazilian pen-pals who helped me. Some sent magazine articles. There were quite a few words that I couldn't find in the dictionary (dica=""hint"", for example). Save your money on this one. Instead, get Random House Webster's pocket Portuguese dictionary (0-679-40060-5) [great for obscure, slang words!] or Collins Gem Portuguese dictionary (0-00-472409-7)."
4,I love this cd!,I wasn't around in the 60s to have to endure all 29 movies but from the few I saw I purely enjoyed. I think people should cut the King some slack because back then that's what a lot of people use to do. Hearing the new remixed version of A little Conversation I can say that I like the original better. Elvis' 60s music is highly UNDERRATED and I think it is some of his BEST!! :-)-early 20 something Elvis fan.
3,implausible ending,"This is one of the slicker new adaptations. Many of the scenes are set on the Thames near the London Bridge and the views are beautiful. The acting is quite good. For those 2 reasons, I quite enjoyed the first 3/4, but during the last 1/4, as the mystery is resolved, the plot is simply implausible bordering on ridiculous."
1,P.D. James is turning in her grave.,"First, this is so dated in is hard to imagine they made films like this at one time. Then, the cardinal error of this genre--trying to follow the book too closely. The acting is poor, the scenery cheap and the general flow of the movie (almost a play really) hard to follow. Had I not read the book,it may not have made sense. Buy the book and happily read it. Forget this mess."
2,"Tough Exterior, Cheap Interior","I was really hoping that this case was going to be nice. The exterior shell of this case is very hard and looks great. However, I had a buckle that did not work fasten properly when I got mine.The interior of the case is cheaply made. There are two bow holders, but they are nothing more than strips of velcro that have been stapled to the interior. Yes, you can see the staples. The compartment under the neck of the cello (where you would keep your rosin) is covered by a flimsy, plastic lid that could be easily broken off. Without the weight of the cello inside, the case will flip over since. So you can never prop it open and leave it without it flipping over. Lastly, the top lid is only secured by two cloth straps. Should those cloth straps fray, rip, or pulled away over time, then you have a two piece cello case.All in all, I found this disappointing quality for the price. It was cheaply thrown together by SKB and they should lower the price by about $100."
2,Average,"I haven't seen any of Fassbinder's other films yet, but this one sucked. There's really nothing remarkable about it at all. The caption on the back describes this film as a ""descent into madness"". A woman gets hooked on cognac and valium, has an affair with a doctor, gets depressed and has to deal with her witchy in-laws. She gets really neurotic and is afraid to be alone sometimes. Big deal. The only outstanding aspect of the film is the leading lady's performance, which is occasionally really creepy.And there isn't anything subtle or disturbing about it. It's just what I've described. I could tell this was made for TV. More like an ABC school special than a foreign dementia film. Watch Polanski's ""The Tenant"" or ""Clean Shaven"" if you want something really crazy."
4,Great nostalgic mid 60's R&B,"B'ham, Ala. we could see the Tams at local National Guard armory. Their showmanship and talent along with a great list of thier own hits will live with me for ever."
5,Great video,If you have ever thought about going to Paris. Or would just like to see what Paris is like this is the video for you. I throughly enjoyed it
2,Nice binder....very out of date.,"The binder itself is nice, but not for what it cost us. I'm glad we didn't order one for every member of the family since we all play the game. If you want it for the information, you'll save money by just surfing the web for info on the game. If you're a collector, then it's probably worth it.If you're a parent, thinking of buying it for your kid....then perhaps you should reconsider... Unless your kid plans on playing this game for years...and most will give it up sooner than later....you won't want to waste your money. The book is already dreadfully out of date as far as the game is concerned, and the publisher doesn't offer updates.Skip over and save your money. 'Nuff said."
3,Coh/Cov Binder(s),"Prima has led people to believe there will be updates to go with these binders, This has not been showen to be true!Yes you can get a free printable update from back around issue 7, If you have the paper and ink to print around 251 pages of udates that are long since outdated!Okay for younger players just starting, but if you are a serious player, you get no useful info here!"
4,Helpful!,This binder is full of info the is very handy in getting more from City of Heroes. A little pricy but the organization is can bring you is worth it!
4,Very funny.,"Even the index of this book had me laughing helplessly. Nasty at times, but never undeservedly. The two Woody Allen essays are classics, as are the ones on Striesand and Rourke"
3,"Queenan on the mark, but misses the target","Joe Queenan's collection of essays on film stars is remarkably funny, and many of the people he criticises deserve all they get! His description of Barbara Streisand as a hatstand is particularly spot-on; she is, too!But although Queenan frequently is on target, he sometimes misses the mark. 'The Seventh Seal' is a long film and Woody Allen makes mostly short ones, so it's unfair to criticise Allen for studying the Berman marathon. Also, I don't know who Sean Young is, but if he wants to improve his mind by studying maths, he should do so without Queenan's ridicule. And calling Sean a woman is a low form of abuse indeed!This book is worth reading - gee, even the index is funny - but you'd get a better idea of what Queenan's trying to say if you watched his low-budget film, 'Desparado', which he made under the pseudonym Rodriguez."
5,My Favorite Cinematography,"that shows the limits of what is possible filming small interiors. Extreme close ups, panning, dollying, and zooming are combined in very subtle ways that always draw attention to the characters' emotions rather than distract from them. Shot composition is also interesting, often capturing several layers of objects and people. The story involves rich peoples' affairs being exposed."
2,Good until it died,"The features and sound were good on this player. Unfortunately, it did not last very long for me. After one year it would just say ""No Disc"" whenever I tried to play any CD. I only used this product occasionally and took very good care of it. I expected it to last longer than just a year."
4,Summary,"The book starts out with Anakin Skywalker fixing his Friends(Tru Veld)lightsaber. Tru, Anakin, and Darra Thel-Tannis are in Anakins room talking. Soon they realize that All of thier masters are in the jedi council room. A mission arises with the known fact that after this mission Ferus Olin(Anakins Rival) Will go to the trials. Anakin knows that this can not happen and thus starts a competion. The Jedi teams are going to the scary planet of Korriban. Legend has it that the sith studied on Korriban......A showdown arives with the meeting of Granta Omega. This book has a surprising ending that will make you re-read it before you can actually grasp what happend. The book ends with death, A friendship betrayed and someone will leave the Jedi order...After reading this book you will wish so much to read the next one. And you will have to wait just as I am waiting for Jude Watson to write STAR WARS JEDI QUEST #11."
3,Death of Jedi Padawan,A Jedi padawan died. Killed by Omega on Korriban. Zan Arbor did not survive. Sad ending. You'll cry.Vote for mesa review!
4,good read but lots of jumping around,"I read this after I read Dead on My Feet. It gets moving rather quickly but all of the initial events happen in the guy's dreams and memories. Which causes the book to be a little bit ""jumpy"". However, the story and the characters are solid and not just another copy of the Anita Blake universe."
3,fun,"I bought this book thinking to read a gay-themed vampire novel which unfortunately is not the case.Luckily enough though, this story is quite good. Christopher, the likeable main character, very well rounded, witty, deep, finds himself thrown into a new world populated by every possible mythical creatures, many of which not exactly friendly.While the book is undoubtedly fun there are still some flaws: from time to time Mr Simmons loses his compass: his writing gets confused, hurried, most of all during action scenes; his sentences are clumsy and disconnected, whole paragraphs in need of a thourough editing.Some minor inconsistencies are to be found here and there; literary references are not always to the point while pop culture ones are hard to grasp for a foreigner.Because of gore this book is not suitable for children."
2,Average,This toy was great for about 5 minutes and then pushed aside. My son is 6 and it was too heavy for him to have on the glasses. They kept falling off. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I won't be buying any of the other spy toys.
3,A good toy NOT,"dont think this is a good toy, you cant hear anything but your own breath and you can hear your breathing with out it. Plus if you wear a real spy your enemy whould see it a mile away.DO US A FAVORtake it out the store"
2,Ok....,Well it dosent really work because t dosent enchant your hearing for more then say just a TINY bit. It sort of works. Its fun hear in there but for the price really not worth it.
2,no good,ok it is very breakable (that is why they say nothing about is duablity) and everyone noce you have it. good thing is it is hands free. gtood thing you could use the lisner for somthing else or on somthing else. bad thing everyone sees it and you shouldnt buy it unless you reily no what you are doeing cuzz nobondy i know did
2,not very good.,this toy is very hard to work you can't even hear anything plus the ear plug can't even fit in your ear and it always falls down .When you're about to attach the spy listener to the sunglasses better ask for an adult because it's very hard. I don't reommend this toy. I got it a week ago and it stunk I don't even use it any more! But sometimes you can hear for maybe a minute.
1,total ripoff worst toy ever!,this toy is so bad. The sunglasses and earpiece look really weird.its not at all what i expected i cant even hear someone whisper 5ft away.it says u can hear but it doesnt say u can hear words.its cheap but it doesnt really work.
5,Truckin' music,"Jerry Reed is the name means truckin'/truckin' music!!this is GREAT long lost music,that only Amazon/this seller has!!Seller had great pricing!!Great shipping!!I am very pleased,and would buy from again!!Thanks!!"
3,I bought it for one song.,I bought this CD basically for one song. I found a couple others that I liked so that was good. I thought the sound quality was good considering that this is much older music. They must have improved the quality considerably. So I would say I enjoy this CD.
3,Mad about Jerry,This album is a great collection of his best songs. It reflects his earlier music and later when he worked on the sound track for Smoky and the Bandit. His soulful voice and upbeat lyrics are amazing.
2,A Tedious Night Out,"Have recently seen the Melbourne (Australian) production of ""The Witches of Eastwick"" and found the music rather vapid and predictable. The song ""Look At Me"", which appears countless times throughout the course of a boring evening, can make you feel queasy as they seem to sing it so many times. Another Cameron Mackintosh chandelier dropping exercise in the art of popular 'musical comedy' - which isn't that funny."
3,Satisfactory,"I read the reviews posted before I purchased this item. Basically I am satisfied with the bed. It is comfortable if used as a temporary bed but not for daily use. Deflating and storing is pretty easy, even for me, an old lady!"
5,Best C.D. for cool funki music,"The Cool & steady & easy C.D sounds live with turbo power low frequency of bass & drums, together with hot brass section. I couldn't guess that the bass and drums made by computers. Lati Kronlund plays better then any other groove band. It sounds excelent, and it's pure cool funk ! Includes :Tower Of Power, Meceo Parker and others it realy is a MUST BUY C.D. Enjoy !!!"
5,"It's certainly cool, and funky and bloody good !","After hearing the 'L train' you'd be tempted to put your player on continuous 'repeat' - don't: you'd miss the excellent 'The Creator has a Master Plan' ! If you like Acid Jazz, and enjoy the likes of JTQ and Brand New Heavies, you can't miss the BFE - they're cool and they're funky: I just love them !"
3,Love the groove; need to hear the words!,"The music is great; so is the poetry, but the music sometimes overwhelms the words. Keep this one in your car stash for those long road trips across the desert. But buy the newer ones to get the total funkerific experience."
1,Disappointing buy,"Don't go and buy this CD. This CD was 'recommended' by 'people who liked United Future Organisation', which is one of my favorite bands. Generally, I'm very open to new suggestions and music and give artists which are unknown to me a try. However, this CD nothing like UFO at all. It's badly produced and badly recorded and just utterly irritating. Be warned..."
2,bfe review,"I thought this cd was ok. I didnt like the fact that some of the beats sounded like smooth jazz, which is the wost music known to man. I also think that they need to learn how to rap. who ever wrote the lyrics, needs to be shot In the face. I did like the jazz eliment though and the track with the tower of power horn section. I think the improv is good."
2,"OK , if you like Blues","I first learned about this album through an ""Acid-Jazz"" listing...it's not. Fairly typical blues tracks, and also mediocre. If you like Acid Jazz, try Medeski, Martin and Wood; Slide Five..."
5,A great read for black history month,"Who would think that in the 1980's and even today racism is rearing its ugly head. Stockdale addresses these issues as we look through the window of Cassie's life as a young black girl searching for love in the segregated south. Although segregation has long been abolished legally, this doesn't change the deep-rooted beliefs in some of today's southern habitants. There is oh so much more to Cassie than one can ever imagine. You will be hard pressed to put Stockdale down."
3,A little too easy...,"Stopping and slowing are more important than skating back-wards for beginners. Did not demonstrate more practical stopping technique's like, link lunge or spin stops. What I was hoping to see was techniques for slowing, such as going down hill. I do not think use of heel brake is feasible in that situation."
5,Answers to unknown Spiritual questions,"The Journey of Life Eternal addresses issues that society seems to be unaware of. The basis of our opinions is clearly explained and the urgent need to live by Spiritual Principles, revealed in the book, is evident. What is so unusal about Dr. Shahmardaan's presentation is that Life's problems are defined in simple terms and solutions,once explained,seem so obvious that one wonders why one did not think of them earlier. Dr. Shahmardaan's writing style is so lucid that even kids can understand the complex principles shared. This book is a real gem and a major contribution to the body of spiritual knowledge that mankind has accumulated over the ages."
5,A Spirtual Guide to Life Eternal,"I found the first 6 chapters of Bahram's book fascinating, stimulating and familiar. The rest makes very interesting reading.I have known Bahram for most of my adult life during which time I have seen him practice and preach what is now finally in print.In my opinion, most will recognise the words therein, a few will understand the meaning of these words, a smaller number will accept the Spiritual Principles and put them into practice. However, I wonder if any will realize what Bahram says all can achieve. I wish each and every one of you Godspeed in your Journey of Life Eternal"
5,Simply enlightening,"The most powerful book I have read in a very long time.Read the book in two evenings. Now I am re-reading with my handy hi-lighter, methodically hi-lighting and scribbling down all the valuable spiritual lessons presented by Dr. Shahmardaan. This is really a must read book that will provide you with extremely easy and valuable tools and techniques to follow on your spiritual path to eternal life. Thank you for writing this book."
5,The Path is clear,"Those who have searched for the Spiritual Path and the Principles necessary to complete the Spiritual Journey can take heart. Finally a book is available that does not mince any words and sheds light on what it takes to embark upon the Journey of Life Eternal and stay the course.For what it offers, the book is really priceless. Kudos to Dr. Shahmardaan. May his star shine brightly so others can see and follow its light."
2,Not as good as original,"Don't buy this version, you're better off with the original. I don't see how they could've been happy with this but from a fan's point of view, it is never a good idea to remix something that was fine the way it was. The added demos are a nice plus though."
1,Mostly fiction,"For an objective account, try the FWBO Files web-site below:http.//www.ex-cult.org/fwbo/fwbofiles.htm"
5,excellent all around,This was a much better transaction than I had expected at this price. Book was much better than described. Book story was great. Keith was indeed an outstanding individual. This book gives insight as to the difficulties of life in the earlier years as well as Keiths phenomenal abilities with guns. A must read for todays gun ownwrs.
2,Boring presentation,"Let me start by saying that i REALLY love Wade Davis. I have all his books and spent way too much time watching him on youtube. This dvd is simply him speaking on a podium with occasional images projected behind. If you are familiar with his material, you will know he can be a bit repetitive. This series of lectures does not cover much new ground, and visually it is a flop. If you are not familiar with his books or films THEN STOP WASTING YOUR LIFE AND GO AND READ the Wayfinders. As far as his films go i really recommend the dvd of the same title or either of the two he has done for national geographic. The biographical dvd was also lovely. This one is only for hardcore fanatics."
5,Excellent,"As usual, Wade Davis shares his intimate and expansive knowledge regarding different people/cultures throughout the world in an engaging and inspiring way."
3,Great shoes! A little Slippery,"I love these shoes but I find that the heal slips on the street or sidewalk unlike other shoes I've owned. Other than that, they're great."
5,The essential flats,"These flats are my favorite! They took a while to break in (the blisters were pretty killer, but I have yet to find a good pair of flats that don't require a break-in period), but now I wear them with everything. I'm about to buy my second pair. They are weightless and super comfy... I can't get enough of them. As per the other review on here, you might want to get a smaller size so that they fit snugly. Perfection!"
2,not so great,These shoes are cute but they fell right off my feet! The elastic back doesn't stay on so that with each step they just came off. I ended up returning them.
1,Horrible,These pads were really bad they got a little hot when in use and then the adhesive that hold the Velcro to the pad gave up and the pad would fly off. I would not recommend this product
4,Page turner,Great read that kept me glued to my Kindle. In my opinion this was better than book 1 and I am now looking forward to continuing the series with book 3. Which leads me to my one complaint so far. And this is about the publisher not the story or the author- I note that the Kindle version for book 3 is more expensive than the paperback. Why is that??
4,"Academ""s Fury (Codex Alera","Had me wishing I could read faster. Very well written, great plot and easy to emphasize with the characters. A little too much detail on the battle scenes."
4,MOre like the Butcher I know,This one was well paced with action and seem to have more of Butcher's writing in it and flowed much better that the first.
5,This is another Great book,Enjoyed reading on my Kindle. While I do enjoy the paper backs this is so convient and they remain accessable also.
5,Excellent Book and amazing series,"Definitely worth the time, each book is better then the last, same goes for Butcher's dresden series."
5,Good!,"Listened to this series, purchased from Audible.com.Jim Butcher has certainly put more passion into the Dresden series, but this was a fun listen as we crossed the country in our car.The downside? We burnt 100's of gallons of fuel listening to these books!All in all - a good listen, but if you are rooted in Dresden, this may not be for you. If you are a fantasy fanatic, you'll like the main character development. If your a history buff (Roman era), this will give you some fiction relief :)"
2,"fragmented sequel, not a stand alone novel","""Academ's Fury"" tries to compensate for a weak plot by switching viewpoints every few pages. The previous book, ""Furies of Calderon"", more interesting. Nothing at all like Butcher's wizard/detective series. If you enjoy J.V. Jones' works, then I expect you'll enjoy this sequel."
2,Dissapointing for a Butcher book.,"I and my wife have fully enjoyed Butchers's Dresden Files series. Since I rate them as some of the best books I have read I thought this series would also be as good. I was wrong. I couldn't get past the first 2 chapters of either of the two books in this series. Mr. Butcher, please stick to what your good at and continue with the Dresdan series. You can't be a Tolkein, so just be a Butcher."
5,Wishing it was longer,"The only problem I had with this book was that, sadly, there was a point when I only had a few more pages to read. I love this fantasy world and I'm invested in the characters. I'm glad to see that Butcher is able to transition to a very different series -- I almost forgot I was reading the 'Dresden' guy's books! The style and tone are almost worlds apart. In any event, a great book to curl up by the fireplace with on a nice long rainy weekend."
5,Loving Tavi,Anyone who likes fantasy would love these books. And if you loved reading the Dresden Files you'll love it even more. Jim Butcher continues in his tipical writing style.
5,One of my favorites now,"For the high fantasy lover, this series cannot be beat. If you liked Patrick Rothfuss's Name of the Wind, or enjoy Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender series, you will love this one."
4,Another excellent book,"Academ's Fury is a fine example of a series book... Picks up not long after the last book left off, and left off with all sorts of suspenseful things hanging! Well written, the book will keep you reading well into the night."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I recently struck upon JB's Dresden Files books, moving from them to the Codex Alera series. The former prove the rule that there's no great bonus for originality -- as long as you do it better. Jim Butcher (and Harry Dresden) do it better with strong charachterizations, detailed (but not over-detailed) plotting and generally light-hearted fare.With the Codex Alera series, JB has ""stepped up his game"" to develop a post-Roman flavored world where elemental spirits, mythical beings, and Machievellian politics mix. The last star I reserved simply because the characters are somewhat one dimensional and the overall plotting smacks slightly of the contrived. These complaints, however, take little away from the excitement of the story and the series overall is a strong recommend."
5,Jim Butcher Hits Another Home Run,"The second book in the Codex Alera series is exciting, riviting, and filled with unexpected plot twists, keeping the reader's attention until the final page; then leaving one wanting more. Butcher is a master story teller. I am looking forward to his next book...and the one after that!"
5,New Wheels Horray,I bought this book thinking it was for the pick 5 lotteries. The wheels in this book are so updated and affordable.If you play the big lotteries then these wheels are for you. I did purchase the other book also for the pick 5 wheels and I am truly excited about it.Again thank you to the author for taking the time to create this book.It is so refreshing to know an experienced person like yourself took the time to make this possible. Thank you.
4,Could be better,This book is excellent for those who play pick 6 lotteries. It may not be as good for those who play 5+1 lotteries such as powerball and hotball etc. This book covers the most useful systems. It does not cover anything that helps you figure out which number would most likely appears in next drawing.
5,Straightforward wheels that work,"I started playing the lottery in Feb. and quickly realized how difficult it is to get a win so I started looking online to find out what might help. I came across recommendations for this book repeatedly. I purchased the book in June and have made some adjustments for the pick 5 lottery, I have also just purchased his pick 5 book directly from his website and have found both books to be very helpful and easy to use. I have been playing on paper while I tweak my method and I have been having good results and expect that I will do well when I am actually ready to play. I think this is a very good book for someone looking for some excellent wheels and already has a way of picking good numbers to play."
1,Don't Hold Your Breath,"A book titled ""GUARANTEED WINS"" is very misleading. It is a kind of ... claim that will disappoint the buyer who expects to win when he uses it. If guaranteed wins were a sure thing, lotteries would cease to exist. Don't expect Bluskov's book to tell you how to choose the numbers--it doesn't. His ""guaranteed wins"" depend on how many of the winning numbers you, yourself, have chosen. This book is no better than any other wheeling book, and not as good as some."
5,Lottery Systems Wheel with Guaranteed Wins,"It took me a while to understand Iliya's system, but I finally got the hang of it but have not had the opportunity to try it out as of yet because I will have to go to Georgia or Tennessee Line to play the Lottery since Alabama doesn't have a lottery here yet with all these HYPOCRIT Preachers and ignorant people saying that the lottery would cause crime, without the lottery there are at least 2 murders at night and 2 at early a.m. hurs practically every day"
4,Lara Croft,"Lara Croft is a famous archaeologist who travels the world looking for lost artifacts. She turns up in Egypt even though she is believed to be dead. People believe she has found the lost amulet of Mareish. The amulet is supposed to give the one who has it great power. Some people long to posses it and others want it to stay lost forever. Will Lara Croft make it out of this adventure alive or die trying?The genre of this book action/adventure. The main characters of this book were Lara Croft, Omar, Gafaar, Hassam, and Kevin. I liked this book and didn't want to stop reading it because it is an exciting book and seems like it will never end. When I finished the book I was kind of upset because I didn't want it to end.I recommend Lara Croft: Tomb Raider the Amulet of Power to everyone who likes action/adventure books. People will like this book because of all the sudden turn of events."
4,A fun read,"I've never read a Resnick novel before, but I've heard of his reputation. I would have passed on this book if not for Resnick's reputation.As a video game tie-in, it's very well done. Video games have a bumpy history of movie and book translations (""Mario Brothers"" and Alan Dean Foster's ""The Dig"" are just two of the low points), but this book did a good job. The action is good, the side characters have more than one dimension to them, and the plot is perfect for this genre.As a stand-alone SF/Adventure novel, however, it's not the best read. While the characters have depth when compared with the video game, they certainly wouldn't stand up against other true SF/Fantasy heroes created by Orson Scott Card, James Stoddard, or Jennifer Roberson.Is it fun? Absolutely. Is it predictable? A tad. Is it deep? Not in the least. As long as you know what you're getting when you pick it up (and who today hasn't heard of Lara Croft?), you'll enjoy it."
1,Lara croft is in danger,I bought this book and read it. If you buy this book you are supporting the people to remove Lara croft. The book is very very boring. In the book she acts retarded and is not the same as the other Lara that we all like. So I don't recommend this book. Lara croft is meant to be in the screen not books.
2,This Lara Croft book sucks,"Try the other one, more recently published, by a different author. It's much better. This one was flat, lame, terrible. Not the Lara we know."
2,the wait is NOT over,"I've been waiting years for someone to realize thatthe world's best selling video game series would makean excellent action-adventure novel series. With therelease of The Amulet of Power, I thought my wait wasover. Regretably, it is not so.Amulet is just plain bad... a bad tie-in to the gameseries, a bad interpretation of the Lara Croftcharacter and just bad adventure fiction. Thedialogue, which seems to cripple the story along istedious, as are scenes where Lara flashes herguns...er, her pistols... anytime she's not gettingher way.I expect there to be a few more books with the LCTRbanner, but my outlook for the series is grim. If thenext novel, whenever it comes along, isn't 180 degreesdifferent, I fear my wait will never be over."
4,Good Phone !,"I purchased the TCX880 for this to work with. Very Happy except having to program all 5 phones individually,with numbers."
1,Headsets Died,"I bought five uniden headsets and, less than a year later, three consistently fail (i.e., disconnect, immediately run out of power though they've been charged for hours). I'm really disappointed with these phones and won't buy uniden again."
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do,I purchased this handset to add a phone in an extra bedroom. It worked perfectly right out of the box.
3,Uniden Cordless 5.8ghz,The phones work well but don't seem to have great distance of coverage like the last 2.4 phone I had. Lately it seems to have a delay when connecting to get the dial tone. Overall we like them and the features but the range and delay in a dial tone is bothersome.
5,TCX800 Great Handset!,"Bought two of these to go with my 8860 base,(total of four) and the Vonage internet phone service. The Uniden phones are the best I've ever used for clarity and no interference,(wev'e had over a dozen phones in the last couple of years)works out great with the Vonage service too!"
4,Shave Em Dry -- Lucille Bogan,"The product arrived on time and in excellent condition. I recommend purchasing this CD only if you understand the type of music and can appreciate it; not for the faint-of-heart. I expected something slightly different because of the years represented. However, I would purchase additional CDs."
1,Eyeball Rupture,"This indeed is a solid gate. And when locked proves a sturdy barrier. But there is a top locking ""T"" piece which sticks out horizontally by a few inches. And when your toddler's eye height reaches approx. 30"" it has the real potential to either injure it straight on or pluck it out during swinging.This dangerous flaw is found in other metal gates also. Be aware. Recall!!Update 04/04/09: On the current accompanying photo you can see the metal ""T"" piece on the swinging top end. Forefront to the lady's right hand."
4,Great for stairs,"We installed two of these, one each at the top and bottom of our stairs. We were careful to read through the instructions and reviews here and installation went smoothly.The gates are very durableso far. Our 1-year old likes to grab onto the bars and try to shake the gate with all of his weight...no loosening yet! The latch is easy to open and close with one hand, and our son does not know how to open it (yet). Overall I highly recommend this gate."
4,Good gate,"This gate is good, I am not saying great because it was a challenge to put on. There are next to none for instructions. But it works and our son is now safe from the stairs."
5,Works great,Works great. I used it for the dog at the bottom of the staires. Need to pay attention to mount it low enough for the dog not to crawl under.
3,"Good gate, double check your install location","The gate is a good design, it can be adjusted via screws to fit wider or smaller opening, +/- several feet. Ideally you want to have wooden structures/studs directly across from one another at the opening of where your gate will go. I have a pretty non-standard setup at my house, so it took some creativity to get the gate secured at the stairs. Please see my uploaded photos. I had to anchor 2 2x4's in parallel to studs so that I could have a surface to attach the gate hinges to. On the other side I had to get a small column of wood and screw it into the banister in order to give the latch something to anchor to. I have an 8 yr old and 5 yr old who use the stairs and they have no problems opening the gate. You just have to lift up in the middle of the gate in order to unlock it."
3,"Good Gate, hard to install","The directions that came with it were difficult to follow. Included low quality installation pieces. However, it is the best option I could find for a gate for the top of our stairs."
4,This is a great short width gate!,I would highly recommend this gate to anyone that requires a gate to fit a narrow passageway. I have two of these. I bought the second one for the top of my stairs after enjoying the first one I put at the bottom of my stairs several months ago. I used longer screws to mount the gate because I didn't feel safe using the short screws the gate came with.
3,It might work if it fits - directions are bad,I never really used this and had to return because it wouldn't fit at the top of my stairs - the handrail made it impossible according to my carpenter. So it might work great for people with a different configuration BUT my low score is more based on the instructions which thoroughly frustrated and confused the carpenter - so make sure you have lots of time before you start trying to put this up
4,Great little gate!,"The only reason for the 4 stars - the assembly instructions aren't exactly the greatest in the world, so my advice is to read everything through, there are corresponding pictures in the back (a mild annoyance since they weren't WITH the written instructions)... It may take a couple times to get it, but once it dawns on you, it takes maybe 5 minutes to put together and hang up!!So far so good.. We got this to keep our little monkey out of our kitchen when we realized he knew how to open the oven and use the door as a step stool to the stove top! It's doing it's job and not damaging the walls like the cheap snap n lock ones do!"
2,There are better gates on the market,Purchased two of these gates and am not pleased with the quality. They use a cheap malleable plastic for the gate ends and supports. I can guarantee they won't last the punishment that kids dish out. I also have a Munchkin gate which uses an allthread and stronger plastic support design. Functions and looks better. (Just doesn't come in black which why I purchased the Kidco).
5,great but had to figure a way to make it fit better,"I searched for a week online trying to find the best one of these for my grandchildren and very pregnant daughter, and I am very happy with this. It is sturdy and well made, however, it was about 1/4 of an inch too narrow for a tight fit, but with the extension it was too wide. I ended up not using the extension, but instead I bought some rubber disc pads that you use heavy furniture legs. and I put one on the wall on each side of the clamp screws. The rubber keeps it from moving, and it gives it just enough more depth to keep it tight! Love it now!!"
3,Hardware insufficient and locking mechanism has issues,"This is the gate for the top of the stairs - the really important gate. A lot of gates are intended for everything but top of stairs. The problems with this gate begin during installation. Appropriate hardware for most situations is not included. I had to find my own parts. The tiny screws included were not nearly up to the job, not to mention that the connection between the gate and the wall required wooden parts as well. As for the locking mechanism, in practice it jams so that it takes a long moment to open the gate when locked. I regret this purchase whereas I've been pleased with the other gates I got."
5,Great Gate!,"The KidCo Safety Gate (with extension) was easy to install and works great as a gate at the bottom of our back stairs to keep our PUPS from wandering off. Yes, we use it as a doggie gate so our pups can go outside (via a doggie door in a sash window close to the floor in the living room), relax on the porch, and then go downstairs to greet my wife when she comes home. Highly recommend...opens and closes with one hand and looks good, too."
1,"Missing hardware, difficult install","This gate does not come with the hardware necessary for installing in drywall. It was also extremely difficult to line up and install correctly. The directions have no pictures (besides the pictures of the parts, labeled at the back). If I installed it again I would still have the same problems (ie. It's not that I just didn't 'get it' the first time)."
2,"Horrible design, difficult to install","We have two of these gates and are very unhappy with our decision. We will be trashing them once we find something to replace them with. They are sturdy once you can get them to latch properly (the only reason they get 2 stars). The install process was tedious and frustrating. Once installed, it is very difficult to actually get them to latch properly. You have to have strong fingers to pull up the latch when opening the gate and your fingers sit on a screw, not on the metal part. It's annoying and painful. Safe gate, just a bad design."
4,Glad I Bought These,"I recently moved into my first 2-story house. So I purchased a pair of these before we even closed on the house. I have been pleased with them.Pros- Sturdy- No trip hazard- Easily open and closesCons- Does require drilling into solid wood (which might be a structural or cosmetic issue for some)As for the installation, I pretty much just disregarded the instructions. I installed the hinges first and then guaged where I needed to put up the latches. And then I just adjusted it accordingly."
1,Poor quality and doesn't latch,"I purchased this gate on line because I could not find a similar gate in a local store. Installing it was a bit time consuming but not horrible. The door itself is solid enough to withstand the constant shaking from my 1 year old daughter. However, the reason I gave this door one star is the latching mechanism. All of our other baby gates will latch on their own when you close it. If you look closely at the picture, you will see that there are two large bolts, one at the bottom and the other at the top of the gate. You have to lift the gate slightly so the bolts can hang on the cradles that hold the gate shut. There is no way you can swing the door and have it latch automatically. Compared to the one gate I purchased after installing this one, the gate that automatically latches is much, much better. Also, the bolts keep comming lose no matter how tightly I secure them. When that happens, I can't close the gate without taking out my pliers and tightening them again."
2,A note about dimensions,"For anyone with a very small margin of error on dimensions, the gate height listed here (30.5"") is misleading. While that is the height of the gate, the height required for mounting it (the distance from the floor to the top of the bracket on the template) is 31.5"" on the hinge side and 33.5"" on the latch side. Unfortunately this means it is impossible for me to install in the location I purchased it for."
2,Beware of the Installation Template,"This is a well designed and well built gate. The installation directions were clear and I followed them carefully. Unfortunately, the template provided to locate the mounting brackets did not match my gate. It was off by about 1/2 inch. That is enough to prevent the gate from latching after installation. If I had simply laid out the latched gate on the template, I would have seen the error and prevented several hours of wall repair and re-installation work.I would buy this gate again but I would throw away the installation template and use some common sense to install it. If it had not been for the unforgivable template error, I would give this gate four stars."
4,Good baby gate,"This is an excellent product, but a bit tricky to install. We use is to confine our dogs to a single room. It is sturdy and easy to operate. I can recommend it for dog use. Our kids are far too old to need a gate."
1,"Too heavy, literally came off the wall","Because the gate is quite heavy, we decided to be extra cautious and use anchors. Less than three months later, it completely came out of the wall. Thankfully, our son was no where near the gate at the time. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
2,"Nice at first, but....","Works great at first, then gets rust/corrosion and breaks. One of the bars broke from the weld/sauder after 3-4 years, thus creating an injury hazard to my infant. Immediately replaced gate with the Munchkin Extender 2100, from Target. The Munchkin is much better. Will review that next."
3,stairway gate,"The gate itself is very sturdy. If you extend it out to the maximum expansion, it is a little weak. I am not very impressed with the plastic hinges that attach it to the wall. The spring and clip that hold the hinge together keep popping apart. We ended up putting a screw through the plastic to keep the gate from coming off each time we opened it."
1,"so awful, it's almost funny","DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF JUNK !!!This baby gate is utterly ridiculous. It is made of heavy metal, but the parts that attach it to the wall ? Cheap plastic !!! Tiny little screws !!! Does that make sense ??? My mom and I spent a good amount of time battling it as a result of the AWFUL instruction manual. Why put the written portion in one section, and pictures in another ??I recommend instead the EvenFlo gate. It's significantly less expensive and the instruction manual is better. The gate is made of wood, the hardware that attaches it to the wall is METAL. Much safer, I think !"
2,have to drill into wood banister,"To install this gate you have to drill into the wood stair banister. We didn't want to do this. There is an option to purchase an installation kit for $30. We didn't want to spend that much on a gate, as we needed to buy 2. We opted for the Regalo top of stairs gate. They come with a gripper and sturdy Velcro straps so you don't need to drill into wood. I did give the Kidco gate 2 stars because it is easy to open/close and has a stopping mechanism so that the gate doesn't swing open over the top of the stairs."
4,Good purchase,I use this gate on my deck at the top of a spiral staircase. It is sturdy and easy to install. Read the reviews about using longer screws to install. The screws included are too short and it is a sturdier installation with the long screws.I have peace of mind now with children on the deck.
5,Really great gate.,"This gate is the only gate that would fit the top of my stairs. I live in a german house, and nothing would fit on the top of the stairs. I tried this gate and it worked."
2,Whining bland drivel,"I can't believe I bought this. Was recommended on Amazon through other purchases. Oh well, you get what you pay for (6c). Still it was a waste of shipping. This is a sort of middle of the road pop nothingness. It's not raw enough to be an acoustic album, there is no rock, it's just lalala land spineless 80's throwback self pretentious blah music. Despite the high scores, buyer beware and make sure you check out the audio previews. Big mistake on my part not doing that and going straight off the reviews."
5,Ké is on of the voices I 'll never forget,"Ké is a singer and songwriter between gender - with an appropriate voice you will not forget. He is born from a Cherokee Indian mother and a French father, he raised in U.S. and Europe. His music reflects his cross-cultural background.I heard Kevin for the first time when I was in Paris. The first thing that shocked me was his voice and that his first Album I Am ( ) has very good songs and lyrics. You can experience his voice on the Amazon preview here. So I though why he didn't got more promotion ?Unfortunately great KE' debut album I Am ( ) had very small publicity and got lost in the millions of records coming every year to the music stores.( http://singlyrics.net/Ke/ )"
4,A real shame so few people know who he is!,"A friend of mine bought this when it came out after reading a review. I bought my own copy, and over 6 years later, I still listen to it over and over. What a unique voice! ""Strange World"" is wonderful, and ""I Don't Wanna Go"" is arguably the best track on the album. I also really enjoy ""Endless Blue"" and his joyful cover of ""Lay Down"". Too many people have missed out on a wonderful artist. It's a shame his follow up works are so difficult to find! Anybody out there know where he is now? He really deserved a lot more recognition for this album!..."
4,"Replacement Speaker in SWR Workingman's 15""","This product works as expected and is an adequate replacement for a blown speaker I had in my 15"" bass cabinet. I use a Workingpro 700 amp to power it and a 4X10 working pro cabinet."
