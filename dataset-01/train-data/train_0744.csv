4,Love it!!,"Great toy. I bought this for my 9 month old who loves banging on things with her hands or her sippie cup, eventually she'll use the hammer. It's good entertainment with primary colors and notes to make simple music."
2,Alright for price!,"I bought this toy for $5.99 for my daughter, I wouldn't pay anymore for this toy! When it arrived I was somewhat disappointed, the keys stick! So it takes a lot of force for the keys to work. My daughter is only 11 months old though but I doubt a month would make that big of a difference."
2,Out of tune,"I bought this because we wanted to purchase a xylophone for our little guy, it was a ""Hot Deal"" and offered free shipping so we could get it delivered quickly since we were ordering baby gates too. It's bright and attractive and our little guy likes banging on it...but it is out of tune, which drives us nuts. I don't expect the world from a kid's xylophone, but it would be nice if the different keys made different sounds -- ideally, progressively going through some type of range. We should have spent the extra $5 for the one from Fisher Price ($14 w/shipping on eBay). My SIL has one of those and it sounds just fine after being well-used for two years."
4,"Really cute, especially for the price","I purchase toys for homeless kids and this was really a hit. I would never guess it was so inexpensive... delivered! It may not be in tune, but it's fun, durable, colorful and the kids love it. You can play it with the keys, or use the hammer on the keys (not much sound hammering the colored plates though) and you can hammer the colored balls, that play sounds as they fall. It's well worth the price."
5,very handy with versitile positions,"works great with varied angle adjustments. also can be put on a short or long extension pole ; 1/2"" pvc does fine to reach those just out of reach positons."
3,brush holder,this is handy but not easy to tighten with large fingers. the tightening screw is very stiff. Dont drop it ..i broke one that way
1,Not up to their usual stuff,"I realize that it is hard to keep up the standards of Clerks ! and 2 and Gothica, but this is just something to make money."
2,I guess this is getting a little old.,Kevin Smith is a fascinating speaker and I have all of his Q&As. This one is a different format as it is co-hosted by Jason Mewes and that is its downfall. Mewes often does a cameo on Smith's Q&As but giving him a bigger role was a mistake. He lacks the quick wit and timing of writer Smith and it makes the show much less interesting. Hearing Smith tell amusing anecdotes is always a good time but listening to Mewes ramble is for the most part boring and distracting. I cannot recommend this.
1,Disappointing.,"I have loved everything Jay and Silent Bob have done ... Until this.This may have been entertaining enough for a ""segment"" on a radio show, but certainly not a DVD.I just felt the whole thing was lame. They're really not that great at performing in a live format, and Jason was basically making 100% dick jokes. C'mon dude. I'M funnier than that. It's basically insulting that he's getting paid. The whole thing made for a pretty lame stand-up/live format.You guys are great on film, stick to that... And if you guys come to my house for the bad review... I'll be shaking the money you owe me out of your pockets."
1,KEVIN SMITH MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE,"Why are we all beating around the bush? The only reason we like Kevin Smith is because of his movies! The podcasts are repetitive as hell! He keeps saying the same thing and DRAGGING IT ON FOREVER to make more and more hours of podcasts. Why not put that energy back into movies where we all found him and loved him! These endless talks about stupid sexual jokes are so pointless and forgettable ... UNLIKE his movies which are great. More movies, no more podcasts, lets be real here people."
3,major tom cd,this song is great! i was happy to find a remix single but i thought the value factor could have been better.
5,Good Tool,"Its a blade what can you say, very good quality and serves the purpose very well. I am happy with this product and it stands up very well."
3,great jeans!!,"I bought these, just so people know, they are the TOW ROPE LIMITED edition jeans. TOgged has the fastest service on amazon and beyond. just rated 3 stars. but that is not a negative thing. these jeans are great. get them while they last!!"
5,So engrossing that I read it in one afternoon . . .,"Mr. China is so readable and so engrossing that I read it in one long afternoon.Even if you already know much about China's emergent capitalism, Clissold puts flesh on the story.He writes with the eye of a very fine journalist, the sympathy of a novlist, and the ear of a poet. The story flies."
3,Cultural Misfits,"I found this book dispiriting because the author never addresses the real issues confronting him and his pal, Pat. They're expatriates mushing around China with millions of dollars but with the sensitivity of maurauding elephants. I can't imagine that any of their investments turned out well. How could they? The author may know Western business techniques, but he's woefully ignorant of what really makes the world tick. As far as I'm concerned he deserved what he got, failure after failure. How depressing if this guy typifies the kind of businessmen we send to different parts of the world."
5,Very interesting memoir from one of China first large investors,This book is entertaining to say the least. If you want a light read and feel like being entertained while also learning a lot of things about China I would recommend this. After reading this I just can't believe how anyone would have ever wanted to invest in China in the early years of its cultural revolution. It was an incredibly corrupt time full of so many problems. The issues that these guys ran into would be unthinkable in a more developed nation. There is a lot of information based on his own accounts which makes for a very interesting story of the early years of foreign investment in China.
3,China,"The book is billed as ""funny,"" but its detail makes it tedious. Funny is better ascribed to ""Lost on Planet China."""
5,Trust,"Mr. Clissold illustrates business experiences in China masterfully. As an ethnic Chinese who have worked mostly in US-based companies, I have often wonder how best to explain the vast difference in US vs. China business culture. It comes down to this: in US we assume trust until proven otherwise; in China the reverse is true."
4,"Now take your rod, Moses, and buy this cd!","This cd was great! I didn't so much buy it for the countless featured artists as I did to hear Zimmer's moving score again. Hans Zimmer does another fantastic job with a few spell-bounding scores, including The Burning Bush, Death of the First Born, and When you believe(non Maria/Whitney version).This score made me believe in cartoon film scores again! This is a great one, take my word for it!!"
4,Some of Zimmer's best music,"This little-known gem of a soundtrack is my second favorite Zimmer pen (the first being Gladiator of coarse). From the ""Red Sea"" to the moving pules of ""The Burning Bush"" Zimmer shows that his talent is not just in writting for action films. Definately worth listening to apart from the film!"
5,When the music makes the movie,This is simply a must have. I want that CD with me in my coffin (JOKE).
3,Not worth it,"I bought this CD because of the song ""When you Believe"" (Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey). After I got home to listen to it, I found out the whole CD (19 songs) there's only about two good songs in it."
2,NOT 100% original Soundtrack - CAREFUL!,"The titling of this CD works badly. Sure - it's music FROM the original movie, but it includes others' versions of sev'l songs, a HUGE disappointment to those who want the original film's singers -- ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" sung by Brian Stokes Mitchell, for example. The cover graphics are misleading, too, as they look the same as the ""real"" original soundtrack - not Amazon's fault. There are several versions of this ""soundtrack"" out there -- be VERY careful which you buy if you don't want the score sung by others than the original cast of the movie (Amazon does not seem to have the true original soundtrack, by the way.)"
5,The Prince Of Egypt: Music From The Original Motion Picture,"Generally I enjoy animated movies, after all I've got 3 boys, so it's a must that I see them, but I absolutely LOVED the Prince of Egypt movie, and the Soundtrack as well. The only thing that I could've done without is the extremely PITIFUL rendition of When You Believe by Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey. They weren't singing actual words as much as they were trying to ""outvocalize"" each other by singing sounds up and down some octaves. Ladies, get a grip and get some talent. But other than that, this Soundtrack is a must have!"
4,good -natured music from of course disney,this album really reflects the moods of the story-very excellent mood and details.
5,Love it! Listen to all the time!,Love it! I am a Christian and I am thankful that this movie was made! We don't have many good christian movies.
5,SIMPLY SWEET!!!,"I LOVE this CD! Every song on it, both instrumental and lyrical, are awesome. I love the song When You Believe with Michelle Pfiefer and Sally Dworsky. I've listened to that song so many times that I know every word that the Hebrew children sing by heart...A-shi-ra la-do-nai ki ga-oh ga-ah Mi-cha-mo-cha ba-elim adonai!! I love it all!!! BUY IT NOW....I COMMAND YOU!!!"
3,Great score! If only there was more of it,"well, needless to say the songs here are so corny they make you flinch-even for a animated film. The score by Hans Zimmer is so great-I just wished it lasted more than 5 minutes."
3,Beautiful music from the movie --- but the pop songs...,"I truly enjoyed the first two-thirds of this album. I adore musicals, and I could see the staging of these songs as I listened to the raw emotion running through them. I had heard Sally Dworsky performing ""When You Believe"" about 6 months previous to the movie, and loved the song then. I still love it now, along with ""The Plagues."" (Who knew Ralph Fiennes could sing?) HOWEVER, the last two songs on the album were the (sadly) requisite sappy, feel-good songs by pop artists (some of whom I normally like) which provide little to nothing to the intrinsic beauty of the album. Those songs really ruined the album for me--so I just pretend they don't exist. I also wish they had put ""Mi Chamocha"" in its correct spot (AFTER the crossing of the Red Sea,) but that doesn't detract from the likable version Mr. Schwartz created."
5,One of my all time favorite movie soundtracks,"I love the composer Stephen Schwartz (Godspell, Wicked) and was thrilled to hear his wonderful music when this film first opened. ten years later, it still stands the test of time. I never get tired of it. the only tracks I don't like on this CD are the ones done by the ""pop stars"" at the end. I much prefer the original movie artists renditions. Two songs are esp. inspiring--There Can Be Miracles (If You Believe) and Look At Your Life Through Heaven's Eyes. Both songs have carried me through some difficult times. A big two thumbs up to this soundtrack!"
2,THIS WHOLE CD SUCKS EXCEPT...,THE MARIAH CAREY AND WHITNEY VERSION OF(WHEN YOU BELIEVE)IS FABOULOUS AND BREATHTAKING IF IT WEREN'T FOR THESE TWO TALENTED WOMEN IT WOULD HAVE NOT WON THE OSCAR .THE MOVIE VERSION IS PATHETIC I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE THIS BORING VERSION.THE TWO STARS ARE FOR MARIAH AND WHITNEY.VIVA THE DIVAS
3,Soundtrack could be better,"Amick Byram is a great singer, had performed in many Christian musicals and cantatas. But in this soundtrack he has only a few songs... and the music providedfor this animated movie mix some ~pop~, ~modern~ compositions that nothing has to do with the times of Moses and ancient Egypt. Background music is good,some of thesongs (When You Believe, other sung by Amy Grant) are also enjoyable."
4,Great Music From A Respectful Animated Remake.,"The music from the Academy Award winning film ""The Prince Of Egypt"" is very well done, except for the contemporary junk they threw in (KC & Jojo, Boyz II Men, etc). My favourite tracks are only the ones which were actually used in the movie, especially ""The Plagues,"" which features a fine performance (albeit all too brief) from Ralph Fiennes, aside from the wonderful visual of fire raining down in the scene. The movie itself is a respectful animated remake of ""The Ten Commandments"" and of the Biblical story of Moses in Exodus-Deuteronomy, the last four books of the Torah. Hans Zimmer is a musical genius, and he proves it yet again here."
5,"If you liked the movie, you'll love this soundtrack!!!!","Let me just start out by saying that I loved the movie ""The Prince of Egypt"" so much that I felt like I had to have a part of it with me. Now, normally I don't like animated films so much, but one of the biggest reasons I liked it was of because the incredible music!! The original soundtrack contains many great songs, like ""Deliver Us"" (from the very beginning of the movie), ""When you Believe"" (both versions: the one with Mariah and Whitney, and the one from the movie), a different version of ""River Lulliby"", by the extremely talented Amy Grant, a different version of ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" by KC and JoJo, and a wonderful ballad by Boys II Men called ""I Will Get There"". The soundtrack also features musical compositions from the movie, and songs like ""Playing with the Big Boys Now"" by Martin Short and Steve Martin and ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" (the one from the movie.) Anyone who enjoys the movie will definitely love the soundtrack!!!"
5,I love these songs,"I love this soundtrack.Especially the song "" through heavens eyes"" I like the soundtrack so much that for Christmas I got the Wal-Mart gift pack. Oh you should like deffinatley buy this. You'd be crazy not to"
5,Has alot of emotion in it,I bought the soundtrack not knowing what it will be like. I listened to it and now I can't stop. It is very emotional. The words has alot of feeling in it.
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"This is an album not to be missed! Hans Zimmer's score is exciting, moving, and emotional all at once. There is a touch of his other scores here: ""The Rock,"" ""Crimson Tide,"" ""Beyond Rangoon,"" and of course, ""The Lion King."" The songs by Stephen Schwartz are very impressive, melodic and dynamic, reminiscent of a first-rate Broadway musical. Just listen to the power of the orchestrations and the choirs on the score. Fans of pop music will appreciate the Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey duet of ""When You Believe,"" although I actually prefer the film's version, featuring a surprisingly good performance by Michelle Pfeiffer (Who knew she could sing like that?). I enthusiastically recommend this album! It has something for everyone."
4,The Prince of Egypt - Movie Soundtrack,Arrived in a timely manner and as described. Absolutely no complaints to offer.Glenda Anderson
3,"Brilliant in some part, average otherwise","Stephen Schwartz went straight from Disney's Hunchback to the Prince of Egypt team: and it shows. The opening approach of ""Deliever Us"", for example.The pop tracks, with the exception of ""When you believe"", are distractions and does not add to the whole. The score by Hans Zimmer is excellent, and so is the lyrics of Stephen Schwartz: but the problem remains that his composition for the songs are mostly flat, like his other work ""Godspell"" and ""Pippin"". A pity really. Having said that, ""Deliver Us"" and ""When you blieve"" are quite satisfying though.The vocal and the quality of the choir is also second-class, compared to other productions."
4,Love the Songs,One of my favorite sound tracks. I like the originals better than the jazzed up versions of the songs though.
4,I'd love to listen to this but there's something I must know,"I've listened to this soundtrack earlier this year and during winter vacation but I can't listen to it too much, because I heard the feature is coming to home video sometime in June, but I don't know when. ""When You Believe"" is a really good song but it makes me want to see the film. Including this, there are three things I wanted to know since February but never did: A theatrical trailer of ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego,"" the running time of Disney's ""Tarzan,"" and the date release of the home video of ""The Prince of Egypt."" I'd recommend this soundtrack to anyone as soon as the video comes out. I gave this album four stars"
3,"Overall OK, except for one HEALTH HAZARD","I was generally satisfied with the quality of the stand, brush, and soap--however, when I opened up the razor (advertised as NEW) there was a HAIR stuck in between the blades.Not even a long hair from someone's head that might have fallen into the packaging--a FACIAL hair that suggests that the blade was previously used before it was sent to me. I was incredibly shocked and disgusted when I found it; it made me feel like the blade was unsanitary and unsafe for use.Just a word of caution for those thinking about buying this item. I wouldn't buy anything from them again."
2,not at all like the image.,"Received 4 pieceSilver Plated 4 Piece Shave Set. Was supposed to have a twin blade trac 2 type razor - came with a mach 3 razor. Different stand,hanger for soap dish. No soapThe twin blade was the purpose of my order = wanted to get away from expensive mach 3 blades.hanging a soap dish with wet soap in it , messy idea. the image showed a soap dish with soap sitting in a round shaving bowl holder.Razor very light weight, would suggest another..The shaving brush is actually fairly nice, but should have bought another 4 piece kit from a better supplier."
4,Nice vintage looking set,Vintage look with modern convenience of fitting the mach 3 razor blade heads. Wanted metal because ceramic or glass cups chip or break. This is a nice qualiTy set
2,not what I ordered,"I thought I was ordering what is shown in the image but the item I received was quite different. The bowl does not attach at all and is a completely separate piece. I am not happy with the fact that it will be taking up more space on my counter. It had a separate hook where the bowl hangs when it's empty, but what am I supposed to do when it has soap in it? Not satisfied at all but I don't trust that if I return it I will get anything different. Very disappointing."
5,Wonderful book for anyone who has ever been crabbing,"I found this book fascinating. I have been driving down Route 13 through Delaware, Maryland and Virginia on our way to Nags Head NC for the past 10 years, and this book makes me want to visit Crisfield as soon as I see the sign. We are headed to Nags Head again for vacation in less than two weeks. I did not find this book technical at all. Also, the fact that it was written over 30 years ago should not deter you from reading it. It is timeless. In fact, this book makes you want to do more research on how the environmental aspects of the Chesapeake Bay have changed since this book's publishing. If you have ever eaten a crab (or caught one), you will not be disappointed."
4,Beautiful Swimmers,If you are interested in the Chesepeake Bay and life of the waterman this is a great read. It tells a lot about the life cycle of the blue crab and the oyster industry. Also tells a pretty good account of the history of the Maryland and Virginia seafood industry. It sadly tells of the development of the area and the life style changes. Having grown up in this environment it easy to see the author spent many years researching the area to give and accurate account. Those living in the area consider it a classic.
4,Beautiful Swimmers,"All about Chesapeake and crabbing. Very very informative and a good read for those interested in that part of the country, and the occupation of the watermen."
3,"Beautiful Swimmers: Watermen, Crabs and the Chesapeake Bay","Not exactly what I was looking for. I was expecting facts and figures. This was more of a story, like Huck Finn on the Chesapeake Bay catching crabs."
3,Attention to Detail,"Whereas I found this book to be quite informative, the author's attention to detail about every aspect and apparatus of a waterman's life on the Cheasapeake Bay to be a bit much. I found it difficult to find interest in how many eel baits were used on a trotline and how close together they were spaced. Not being well versed on the parts of various fishing vessels, I found myself lost as to what the author was writing about not to mention the numerous detailed descriptions of every piece of fishing apparatus employed by watermen."
5,Entertaining and Educational,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I spent summers as a kid catching crabs and seeing commercial crabbers outside my grandparents' home but there was a lot about the industry and the bay that I didn't know. I felt like an eavesdropper on an unfamiliar yet familiar world as I read this book, and found my curiousity awakened. The writers clear appreciation for his subject shines through, and it is a delight to discover even many years after it was written."
1,horrible,"This book is just a drawn out emporium of uselessnes. Utterelly disgusting, no real information was given, nothing is relivent."
5,A breath of fresh air during a long winter.,"I love this book! After having spent all our summer vacations on the Eastern Shore for many years, I am always looking for a ""fix"" of the shore during our long Midwestern winters. This Pulitzer Prize-winning book was just what I needed. The author writes beautifully and sympathetically, but never condescendingly, of the watermen of the Chesapeake Bay and their continuing struggle to make a living from the sea as their fathers did."
4,An excellent overview of learning in Babylon and Egypt.,"This book explains the level of learning and advance of knowledge that was aquired by the ancient cultures in Bablyon, Sumer, and Egypt.It gives a good overview of the mathematics, and astronomy that was aquired in these cultures, and the progression of this to the more modern Greek and Roman cultures."
4,Good warm deal!,"The bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater. Material is good for both the t-shirt and hoodie. For the quality and price, can't beat it anywhere!"
1,sensationalism,"'Ibsen and Hitler' is just the latest in a series of sensationalistic Hitler 'exposes', right up there with 'Hitler's Flying Saucers' and 'Hitler's Antarctic Hideout'. The question is: would the Third Reich and its crimes have taken place without Ibsen? The answer is absolutely yes. Unless the author can also prove, I suppose, that the hundreds of thousands of cronies who did their part for the holocaust- down to the truck drivers who shipped zyklon B and engineers who designed the ovens- also read and plagiarized from Ibsen, his findings serve only to titilate rather than shed any serious light on the workings and motives of the Nazi murder machine."
4,Slow Grinding War Metal,"Bolt Thrower play a very basic style of Death/Grind/War Metal. I really enjoy all their releases, but quickly get bored with them. The problem is, there is little variation between songs and albums. Once you hear one track, you have pretty much heard the album. Mercenary has the most variation in song structure of all Bolt Thrower releases. This makes it more entertaining over the course of the entire album. A brutal release by a very talented band and I think any fan of BT or Extreme Metal will enjoy Mercenary."
3,Bolt Thrower - 'Mercenary' (Metal Blade) 3 1/2 stars,"British thrash band's seventh release. Nothing too brilliant to take in here, however I thought each of these tracks were at least reliable for what this particular music is meant for. Couple of the tunes I was digging include ""Zeroed"", title cut ""Mercenary"" and ""Powder Burns"". Line-up: Karl Willetts-vocals, Baz Thompson & Gavin Ward-guitars, Jo Bench-bass and Alex Thomas-drums. Might appeal fo fans of Death Angel, Sacred Reich, Stormtroopers Of Death and Possessed."
1,BORING AND REPETITIVE,"This CD was disappointing since the previous drummer was replaced that might be why this album suffers from repetition. The only song that I really liked was (No Guts,No Glory)and the other songs didn't offer much and sounded all the same."
1,Size,Problem with this shoe is that they don't carry my size 8.5 double E. So why is that I am having a problem finding my size. Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department. To me there is no excuse of not carring my size.
4,A Very Interesting Book,Talking at Trena's is a book that I really got into when I started reading it. It is based around the conversation of African Americans in a tavern. The funny thing to me is that the same subjects that were talked about inside the tavern are the same things that my friends and me talk about. It went to show me that there is really a bridge between African American males. This book was a solid read because you could be drawn into the situations and really feel like you are in the tavern and you are armed with your own opinion about the topics that are being discussed. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a look inside African Americans to see how we feel about certain situations or any African American who wants to see how others feel about situations that you have formulated an opinion on.
5,A Book Worth Reading,"Talking at Trena's is a book worth reading. This book is an easy read and definetely one that will be hard to put down. May does an exceptional job at paralleling the life of the tavern with all different aspects of daily life such as TV, realationships, and work. Readers can also see how May intertwines race as a foundation of the novel in order for the reader to understand the different racial dynamics that occur between the interaction of the characters in the book, as well as in society. Throughout the novel, May uses vivid language to depict the character's personal lives and emotions. This book is fun and exciting and definetely one you should consider reading."
4,May Captures Genuine Atmosphere at local tavern,"Reuben A. Buford May's book, Talking at Trena's, is a well-written, interesting, and unique look into an African-American tavern located on the south side of Chicago. May focuses on the interaction and connection of regular patrons of the tavern that is dominated by middle-aged working-class men. The book gives insight into topics of social and cultural significance as it analizes the everyday ""man gossip."" May's book is a well-rounded account of topics such as humor, race, marriage, and sex that occur in a male dominated atmosphere. Reuben A. Buford May's book is a must read for anyone interested in the sociological and cultural aspects of not only African-American males but males in general."
5,Awesome,"I think that the author really understands this culture. I've read several authors where they obviously had no idea of what they were writing about. Not May, I knew those characters. The emotions, the pains, joys, and sorrows and the laughter. Those are my friends. This book was truely in focus."
3,The story of a doomed Queen who seemed to have it all,"I really wasn't sure if I should give this book 3 or 4 stars. It's actually a well written and very well researched fictional reconstruction of the life of Queen Marie-Antoinette of France, from the age of 14 till her death at the scaffold at age 39.This is a dense novel and not a quick read and deals with Marie-Antoinette's life in such detail that it seems to read slowly at times. In fact, I suspect that if you have read any of the recent factual biographies of the Queen then you may find this book going over old ground. Personally, while I admire the research and historical re-construction of this book, actually enjoyed _The Queen's Confession_ by Victoria Holt more and I know it would be an effort on my part to read this book again."
3,Very Interesting book about a rather self absorbed woman,"This is book is well written and takes you back in time. I found that in the first half I considered Marie to be a useless person.. Very frivolous. Her life was nothing but clothes and parties and having hair piled atop her head and she sure did have her picture painted a lot. She was not an admirable queen.. rather self absorbed while her country is starving. However, in the second half she becomes a mother and it all bout the kids and she starts to grow up. I liked the contrast and the way you see both sides of the woman. The woman that died was very different from the woman that showed up in France and I like the way this author shows us that."
4,A Colorful View into Marie Antoinette's World,"The best thing about Naslund's portrayal of Marie Antoinette is how perfectly she captured the young, hopeful, and often naive voice of the Austrian beauty. Like all worthy books, this one has much to teach. The language is so ornate, the descriptions as sweet and rich as a truffle, that one cannot read this quickly, but rather in savored doses."
3,I wanted to love it.....,"I really did. I had been looking forward to reading this book for some time and I really had high hopes. But unfortunatley, I just couldn't get into it. I gave it 150 pages and then put it down. Maybe I should have kept going, maybe it would have picked. It just didn't grab me and there are so many books out there waiting for me to read them!! Maybe I will give it another try sometime."
3,Struggling,"I'm struggling to get into this novel, but I do like it. The fact that it's written from Marie's POV is intersting. Thus far, it's not holding me captive the way I'd like it to."
4,Tackling an icon with humanity,"I was skeptical about a novel told through the eyes of an icon like Marie Antoinette. The subject in itself is buried beneath myths and lies, making this a brave effort even before I read it. Once I began reading it, however, I found myself unable to put it down. The negative reviews I've seen here are surprising to me because even if you take away the subject of an icon, it's still a well-written, interesting story. So many historical novels are poorly written and read like people in costumes. This novel is great and I highly recommend it."
5,Marie Antoinette; not what you always thought,"I throughly enjoyed this book. I read it mainly because it was by the author of Ahab's Wife, one of the best books I have ever read. After reading it, and knowing how the author researches facts before putting pen to paper, I have an entirely new appreciation for the Queen of France. Things are not always what they seem, and I was touched to the core as I learned of her life, and subsequently, her murder. I definitely recommend this book."
2,Truly Disappointing,"Unlike many here I did not purchase this book because I am a fan of Ahab's Wife (I have not read it) but rather because I am an avid reader of both historical ficion and non-ficton alike and have especially enjoyed many historical fiction books written in a POV, Diary format such as The Diary Anne Boleyn - I, Elizabeth and the Josephine Trilogy diary trilogy.I am the type of reader who gets into a book and stays up too late to read just one chapter, just one more page . . . unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for my sleeping pattern) this book did little to engage me. It does not pull you or make you care about Marie Antoinette as other books about her have done for me. Forgot this and get To The Scaffold"
4,Off with her wig,"""Ahab's Wife"" by the same author was probably one of the best books I've ever read. There was so much depth of thought from the main character about her life and life in general. I was expecting something similar with ""Abundance"", but didn't find it. This book is interesting in that it presents Marie Antionette's life from her perspective, a human perspective complete with emotions, but those emotions seem thin in many instances. For instance, after the first dauphin dies, there is a lack of grief on her part. I have lost a son, I know that the emotions it causes creep into everything you think and do forever. I liked the side of Marie that wanted privacy and cared about the good of the ""people"". There was a lot to like about her in general. Overall, it was an entertaining book and it made me appreciate the person who Marie Antionette was more than I did."
1,Beyond Boring,"This is painfully hard to get into, drags, and moves at the pace of a snail. The facts are buried in drab and boredom. Skip it, rent the movie"
5,I knew it would be great!,"As a fan of Sena Jeter Naslund's wonderful writing, I awaited the arrival of Abundance with anticipation. I was not disappointed. It is beautifully written, sensitive to the young queen as she moves through the various stages of her life, and is true to her real character as revealed in her actual letters to her mother, Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria. I was delighted with the first person approach that Naslund dares to use. Naslund's treats the queen's last days and moments with dignity, as Marie herself is said to have lived them.Bravo to the writer for another fabulous novel!"
1,Mindless Drivel,"Ms. Naslund has done the impossible - she's made Marie Antoinette boring! She is portrayed as floating aimlessly through her life while thinking kindly, flowery thoughts about everything from her handkerchief (which has too much lace and not enough fabric to blow her nose on) to her little plum colored shoes (that served her so well.) I promise you, when Marie Anotinette was standing on the scaffold, she was NOT trying to decide if the color of light is ""more silvery or gold"". By the end of this book I was ready to put my own head in the guillotine just to stop the pain.If you want exceptional research and well-written biography, read Antonia Fraser's ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"". If you want page-turning historical fiction, try Victoria Holt's ""The Queen's Confessions""."
4,Enjoyable and informative,"I admit that I knew little about Marie Antoinette (except for her infamous ending)until I read this book. I enjoyed the personal perspective in which it was written; reading like a journal. From other research I have since done, it appears that the author is accurate in her accounts and details. I like to think that Marie Antoinette was not the monster she has historically been painted to be, but rather, a girl raised with royal expectations and privileges that didn't allow her to express her empathy to her subjects as she wished she could. As a result of her upbringing, she simply didn't know how to relate to those beneath her.The book was enjoyable, interesting, eye-opening and informative. Got a little slow about a third of the way into it, but then picked up again and I couldn't put it down. Nothing like Ms. Jeterland's last book, AHAB'S WIFE, where I couldn't get past the first few pages. I recommend this one!"
3,"""Abundance: A Novel of Marie Antoinette""","I am still plodding my way through this book. I made the mistake of first reading Antonia Fraser's biography of Marie Antoinette, and Ms. Naslund seems basically to have fictionalized this book. Unfortunate, since I had thoroughly enjoyed ""Ahab's Wife"" and was hoping she would bring some of that originality to another familiar story. If you have purchased both books, ""Abundance"" will definitely whet your appetite for the heavier Fraser tome. Regardless, Marie Antoinette will continue to entice us."
5,Enthralling -- I Couldn't Put it Down,"I received this book as a Christmas gift and didn't think I'd enjoy it since I hadn't been able to finish Ahab's Wife by the same author. However, I found I couldn't put this book down. I literally carried it with me to read in the car when accompanying others on errands the last week of December. Not only was the writing excellent, the characterizations held my interest, the historical details were fascinating, and the plot (even though I had an idea how it would turn out) was captivating. Reading this book made me curious to learn more about French and European history and more about Marie Antoinette and her life."
2,Not up to par,"I was disappointed in this portrayal of Marie Antoinette. Naslund describes her as too emotional and immature. The book was way too sappy for me, I couldn't finish it. I understand Marie was young, but this portrayal is flimsy."
3,My take on Abundance,"This was an okay book. It felt more like a report than a ""novel"". I assume it was based on history but very weak in the historic line."
1,Product not delivered,"It is impossible to review this product because we have not received it as yet in spite of the fact that it was supposed to have been shipped by June 22, 2007. What can we do?Francis HinnendaelNite: I gave it one star because it was necessary to fill in the blank"
4,Very good product.,"As always, alpine delivers with great overall sound quality, and awesome fit, finish, and fitment. The full speed Ipod controls work well, and are intuitive after a minute or so. The percentage search function works well for scrolling through large libraries (this is helpful for me considering i have over 1700 songs). My only quarrel is that the bluetooth module costs an additional 165 dollars on amazon. Other than that, highly recommended and a great value."
2,"Love the Features, Hate the UI","I bought this unit for the iPod integration, and haven't been disappointed. It is very easy to plug in, and sounds great. BUT the user interface is horrible. I have had it installed for six weeks, and still have to pull over (or wait for a traffic light) to switch CDs or iPod playlists. I have a MyFi unit for my XM satellite radio that operates on an unused FM frequency, and getting an unused FM frequency is near impossible on this Alpine. I have finally managed to learn to switch between iPod, CD, and radio while driving, so for short trips I'm OK, but I cannot yet remove the manual from my glove box, because doing anything else is so counter-intuitive."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is a wonderful book showing the power in prayer, and how through prayer, we can appeal to God and even get Him to change His mind. Excellent book, and well worth the read. I highly recommend it."
4,Good Drills,I was new to coaching youth basketball and needed ideas for drills. This book was helpful with drills as well as good diagrams and explanations.
3,could be better,Could be better for beginners. some of the ideas are basic which is good for young players but some of the plays cannot be run by younger players.
2,Bob in Albany,The film was a bit lame. I was surprised that some quality actors took roles in this movie. Glad it was free
1,Hideous,I'm known for loving bad acting 80's and 90's sci fi flicks but this was PAINFUL... I started to fast forward through most of it because the acting was Truly painful to watch. It could have been a great film but the talentless actors ruined it. BOO.
2,Not that good,Watched this when I was bored. There are some good people in it but it's not very good. I DON'T recommend this unless you lower your expectations.
3,disappointed,Was looking for more alien interaction with more action and less drama. The aliens have no lasting effect on my memory
1,The premise is interesting,"Too bad about the bad dialogue, acting, directing, sound, cinematography, and special effects. This honestly looks like it was put together as a film school project. By an obscure film school...A shame, because I usually like David Keith, and Stephanie Niznik looks like she could have done a nice job with decent lines and direction, but you know what they say about ""ifs and buts"".I only made it to the 45-minute mark, so if the last part attained a measure of quality then I missed it, so take that into account."
2,Epoch,"Acting, screen play, story line leave something to be desire I do not know2 what else to say but it was terriable"
1,I gave EPOCH 2000 1 Star,"Because I could not give it a lower score.This Sci-Fi flick is a mystery. Some well very known stars, acting as if they were in a Woman's Club play. The plot is where this film falls apart. Trying to use too much symbolism makes it very hard to understand.It has good cast, this is how I was fooled into watching this awful movie. Cast: David Keith, Shannon Lee, Ryan O'Neal, James Avery and Craig Wasson."
1,A epic bomb,"Washed up, bloated, Ryan O'Neal is the star of this TV flick, so that should give you enough information to know just how bad ""Epoch"" is going to be. Unfortunately, I bit anyway. What a colossal waste of time. The plot is transparent; the characters, unbelievably shallow, hackneyed and stock. The actors? I've seen better acting in high school productions. They deliver lines about as well as Ackroyd's Beldar from Saturday Night Live. How the producers and directors could have put their names to this time waster is beyond me. Don't be fooled by the cool production art on the DVD cover. This...is of such ""Epoch"" proportions the fact that it actually was released should be science fiction. I feel like such a fool for having rented it to watch."
2,EPOCH,"Silly unrealistic goofy was yanked from theaters; Ryan O'neal??? really? Fat ole nasty drunken wife-beating tub-o-lard thought he was dead. He is dead as a bag of dirt in this loser flick. He must have been broke and desperately needed to buy some booze and blow to come out of his hole to do this movie, what a joke!! Go kill yourself man-you suk. David Keith is also in this crappy movie, figures tho crappy has-been long-forgotten down and out actors in need of a paycheck simply makes for a truly shitty movie. Its a waste of time and money unless your 11-12yrs old and/or your Playstation is broken."
2,Flimsy,"This terry cloth wrap was pretty flimsy for the price, plus it said ""medium"" but the waist is way too big for me, and I am always a medium."
2,"nice idea, but.....","When you use this bag in the messenger position (pictured), you cannot put anything in the bag becuase it is full of itself. The only way you can acually use it to carry anything is to open it up and carry it like a shopping bag. I was disappointed. But, on the plus side, it is light weight and small and you can throw it in your suitcase and in case your possesions ""grow"" on your trip, you'll have an extra bag for them!"
4,Well Done,"If you're a fan of Belle & Sebastian, Goldenboy, or the Go-Betweens you should enjoy this c.d. I've listened to this ten times now and keep discovering new things I enjoy about this. The vocal phrasing on ""London School"" is really good. The guitar riffs through-out this c.d. are just great and very catchy. Well done."
2,Disappointing. Should have been a lot better.,"I've read several books by Blanchard. I like his approach on behavioral side of management. I bought this book, expecting to find just that. Since most of the ""visionary"" books deal with the organization or system perspectives, I always want to know about the ""human"" side. But I don't find the answer from this book. The contents are too light to provide any answer to the issue. Unlike some good books on the similar topic such as James Martin's Cybercorp which tells you in very details on how you should prepare for the future, Mission Possible does not give me anything comparable"
5,The Successor to FLA is here,As a long time fan of Delerium and a listener of the associated 'Front Line Assembley' and a fan of electronica and industrial sounds I purchased this debut album from the mind of Tom Shear. 'Assemblage 23' is a sole artist opinion and Tom has created a vast plethora of ambient and hight industrialised electronica. I had to listen to this album twice to fully appreciate the workings of this artist and found I enjoyed the varied sounds and tempo of the music. I loved the way the lyrics were played out robotic by Tom Shear. It is the debut album for this artist and I see a bright future for Tom Shear in the industrial music scene. He has much skill as Leeb & Fulber. The best song is 'Purgatory' and the last 3 tracks are remixes that will make it on the dance club list sooner or later.
2,Not too good.,"This is my least favorite album by A23. Than again this is Tom Shear's first album, so it's not so hard to see why it isn't his best work."
5,Bad to the Bone,"If your a Purple Sage fan this is just frickin' awesome. I wish every album I downloaded had this kinda' sound quality,.........totally blew my mind!!!!!!!!!"
3,"A couple nice hits, and then some.","Like many people I checked this group out knowing that Jerry Garcia and a few other Dead alumni played with this band in the early days. It pretty much sounded as I expected. Solid country rock. Kind of a cross between early Grateful Dead, Byrds and Gram Parsons. Nothing too deep, just light country rock with a bit of humor thrown in. Any fan of Flying Burrito Brothers or Buffalo Springfield might like this. There's no doubt the album cover sold a few extra copies. I framed my vinyl. Maybe they could have called this ""The Breast Of"" or ""Greatest T*ts""."
2,Dowco motorcycle cover alarm is okay,Dowco 26038-00 Guardian Cover Alarm not loud enough to be heard inside the house. Sounds like a police siren. It would be better if it sounds like a growling Doberman and louder. Should have an additional features such as setting the lenght of time for the alarm siren to blare before automatically shutting it off and paging to notify that the alarm went off. Best defense would be the motorcycle alarm.
5,Thai Hide and Seek!,This is a sweet book about a baby playing hide and seek with her father. It takes place in Thailand and they are playing around the yard. Animals are near and the sounds they make are on display too. Sweet book.
4,"Nice Introduction to a Relaxing, Spiritual Experience","It's a good book; an easy read. With a bit of background and set-up, Gefen quickly and easily gets the reader into the process. Yet even here - avoiding getting bogged-down in lots of dry, background material - there is a sense that the author had to work very hard to ""puff"" this to make a 170ish page book, when it would have been just as effective as a tightly-edited 20-page article. The lure and prestige of a book credit is obviously great. Nonetheless, I recommend it as an excellent way to learn and cope with our crazy, imperfect, in-need-of-repair world."
1,Save your money,"The author does not seem to have a good grasp of Judaism. She seems to think of Jews as either being Orthodox and observant or simply non observant. She does not seem to understand that the beauty of the religion is in finding what will work for you. She must have discovered her religion late in life because she continually describes how she ""discovered"" the Shabbot or how she ""discovered"" Orthodox services. This book is written more for the Jew who has no knowledge of Judaism rather than for those Jews who do.This book has kabbalistic themes running through it. It would have been more interesting to see how mainstream Judaism handles meditation. The author feels that by using Hebrew words Jews will feel more comfortable meditating. To some extent that may be true but I didn't need to buy the book to find Hebrew words to meditate on. Save your money!"
4,It's great!,"It's just an other album of Babyface. He changed Christmas song into a style I love most. However, it's far from Christmas now, for this I can listen them for months..."
1,Not Satisfactory,I think help.sap.com is much better than this book and the price is also very high.SAPGURU
4,Good!,"I found some of my old Little Golden Books hoping to find some that my niece might like read to her and Micky Mouse The Kitten-sitters was a favorite of mine that my friends had given to me when I was sick. In this story Minnie goes to visit her cousin Millie and leaves her kitten Figaro at Mickey's house where he and his nephews Morty and Ferdie have to watch her kitten. Minnie thinks her Kitten is the most well behaved pet but as soon as she leaves Mickey, Morty and Ferdie soon discover that Figaro is anything but well behaved and he causes much calamity. Though I really liked this book I remember when I was little not liking how Minnie was such a grouch and yelled at them and wouldn't believe them that all the trouble was caused by Figaro and her refusal to listen to them and her blaming everything on Pluto really ticked me off and I remember that bothering my nephews as well when I read it to them but it's still a good book that apparently is out of print these days."
4,Good Compression Shorts,"I find these to be comfortable and they survive the washer and dryer process well. I have purchase 4 pairs in all. My only complaint is that I think they are a bit pricey, but their performance is fine."
3,Material Too Thick.,The material is too thick and I feel I am wearing a bulky item of clothing. I do not like their tightness. They are not easy to put on or take off.
2,Couple of good singles. Too repetitive. Look for it used.,"A couple of singles peak (like the blazin' ""560"") but most of this is disappointing. Drags on'n'on, like most d'n'b tracks made for mixing. High end production can't hide a lack of imagination. Damn, and I expected more from him. Can't he think beyond 3 minutes, on a 7 minute song? Starts with lots of promise, then just plain drags for the rest of the song...Look for the singles on mixed tapes. Otherwise, find it used."
5,Finally....,"Probably the most awaited album on drum n'bass history. The king of jungle strikes with a very intelligent album rich in sounds and grooves. The Grooverider simply couldn't come with another album, Mysteries of the Funk it's an one of it's kind album."
4,Up in the RANKS with RONI SIZE.,"This CD bumps!!!...The ill flow of the beat and the tight swing keeps you flowin and blowin up hardcore. Definately up there with Roni and Aphordite. Groove proves to be a essential D&B album that tells the stories of life through Beat and Sound. Check out track 5 ""Jack the Ripper"" its my fav on the album. BUY THIS CD IF YOU LOVE D&B! Nuff-Sayd"
3,OK as a sampler,"This is best used as a party CD or for teaching. The tunes are fair, the cha cha is awful. The tango is even worse. The rumba is nice, and the waltz a bit fast. It's just OK ..."
3,Worn,"Book was very worn. The cover was almost falling off and the binding was loose. However, the product can be used for the purpose needed."
5,Mystery and depth,"In the Lake of the Woods is an amazing journey into memory ands madness - the madness of war, the madness of past sins, the madness of staying with someone you are scared of. This book is not easy. It takes you into various levels of uncertainty and mystery. We all live with our pasts. Some are more fraught with pain than others, but all shape who we are today. The main characters of In the Lake of the Woods, John and Kathy, both have many layers of hurt and pain to deal with. There are many options presented, but none are settled on. There is mystery and depth here."
4,Required reading,"I purchased this book for my college ENG class as a required text. At first I found some of the language offensive and didn't really like it, but as I continued reading the book was very intriguing and sucked me in. I ended up really liking the book and enjoyed reading it, even if it was required."
1,"Hateful, misguided, spottily brilliant","I found In the Lake of the Woods brilliantly written in spots but absolutely wrongheaded in two of its fundamental assumptions: 1)mental illness is caused by trauma, evil parents, and evil deeds, and repression. This is the scientific and moral equivalent of hunting witches. 2) humans are psycologically incapable of committing mass murder, then living successful lives. We have been wiping out our enemies for many tens of millennia, and most of us are doubtless capable in the wrong circumstances of continuing the practice. Wallowing in gothic fancy is not dealing with this dark truth.In the last several decades this is the book I am most sorry to have read. Doubtless a Nobel awaits O'Brien."
1,This book is horrendous,"In The Lake of The Woods is terrible. It is without a doubt one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are annoying and I can't bring myself to like them. The book has absolutly no climax or ending. I would rather read Tale of Two Cities 1353151515135 times then read this piece of garbage again. But, if your into really boring books that think they are smart and funny then you should read this. Why the author ever wrote this book is beyond me, he should retire."
1,From a student's perspective...,Horrible. Simply and utterly horrible.Note: My class mates and I were forced to study this atrocious book and subsequently fould it to clumsy in its attempt to be ambiguous and different. Not a novel that one would want to read for sheer entertainment.
1,How disgraceful!,"... I felt the author hide his writing and storyline behind his continuous use of profanity and religious blasphemy. Did it add to the novel to constantly have the character chant ""Kill Jesus"". I mean really, was it necessary? ..."
4,Vietnam Horror & Trauma,"I was deeply moved by this novel. The descriptions of Vietnamese village massacres, the testimony of American soldiers at My Lai, and quotations from parallel historical events and historical figures made this book 3-dimensional. It was also in the genre of a who-done-it and what-really-happened. The historical tragedy compliments the personal tragedies (child abuse, nightmares, betrayal). To put it bluntly, I highly recommend the book."
5,"Engrossing, mysterious and sad","Typically when I read contemporary fiction, satisfaction in the novel is gained in its conclusion and resolution. This novel has no conslusion and certainly no resolution, however, I came away as satisfied as I ever have. The sadness surrounding the story does not hinge on exactly what happened to Kathy at the lake, but rather with the loss of innocence in war and the disintegration of a once beautiful, albeit disfunctional, relationship. I must admit, as a 24-year old male with very little emotions when it comes to reading novels, I was surprised at myself as the tears openly flowed while reading the final ten pages. I highly recommend this book to anyone in my generation, as it provides insight to the horrors of war beyond the battlefield."
3,Disturbing,"We live in a media-driven society. Political conventions are Oprahfied. In the Lake of the Woods uses that background and does so very effectively. What happened here? Is perception different from reality? Whose perception? Whose reality? The reader is given access to a vast number of perceptions and left to discover their own reality. What DID happen here?Brooding, enigmatic, disturbing.If nothing else, you know it's not a good sign when he waters the plants with boiling water."
3,Pleasantly Unclear,"I chose to read this book for my English class. I may have procrastinated the reading, but when I picked this book up I couldn't put it down. O'Brien manipulates you on the outlook of every aspect of this novel; this keeps you guessing and yearning for answers. He kept the characteristics of the individuals in this story very vague; I suppose it is our job as readers to draw conclusions. What I found most disappointing about this novel is the ending. After going through an emotional roller coaster O'Brien leaves you stranded and confused in the end. O'Brien doesn't give enough information in the conclusion of the story to make any type of closure in your understanding of the novel."
3,In the Lake of the Woods -- A Classic? I think not.,"""In the Lake of the Woods"" by Tim O'brien is a classic example of a book that had wonderfuloppurtunity but just did not make the cut withme for several reasons. First, though, I mustO'Brien for a brillient job at concieving anintriguing plot for a mystery. However, the storywas too shadowed and shady. The literaryaspects of the book were quite exceptional intheir originality but quickly grew old and thuscaused the book to grow lathargic and slowmoving. I encourage those of you that enjoyunique literature to read this book for its literaryaspects, but if you are looking for a book thatwill hold you interest until you finish, you mightnot want to look here."
3,In the Lake of the Woods,"I read ""In the Lake of the Woods"" in my English class. I think it was chosen for the curriculum because it is very well written and it really makes you think about moral issues and about what really happened to Kathy Wade. I wouldn't recommend this book to most people because much of the book is very disturbing, the coarse language that is used, and the ending that leaves you with all questions and no answers. ~~Amy from Walla Walla"
5,Wow....,This book was definitely gripping and still leaves you to wonder...What happened to Kathy??? I had to read this book for my lit class and absolutely enjoyed it! Suspenseful and smart...I give this book 5 stars!
3,In the Lake of the Woods,"I thought that this book was a good and interesting book. It good beacuse it deals with a real event in history,the Vietnam War. It does a good gob of discribing what war is like through the eyes of the character John Wade. It is also interesting because it shows the way war effects John Wade even long after the war. It also deals with his relationship with his wife and how he deals with being defeated in the political elections. This book is also a mistery novel and does a good job of switching from past to present times."
3,What I thought...,I thought this was a pretty good book. Except I didn't like how it was written. I didn't really understand the hypothesis chapters until after a while and that made it kind of confusing to read.
2,i read this book for a report,"this book was good but it said sweared too much and the interview parts seem to repeat over and over, but it made me wanna keep reading because i wanted to know want hapened to kathy, 300 pages long, it was just right for me, but i think this is for an advanced reader because i did't really catch on at first like the first 150 pages this was really confusing me all the kathy said then john said was confusing me, and i needed a better vision and setting than just minnesota in the lake of the woods, but i think i won't be dissapionted with this book well off to do my report bye,"
5,"Vietnam Lives, Perhaps Forever","As the author of a mystery novel featuring a former politician as a protagonist, I found Tim O'Brien's IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS a fascinating work when I first read it during its initial release. This week, following the revelations by the former Senator Robert Kerrey of his haunting tale from his service in Vietnam, I read O'Bien's book once more. IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS survives the test of time. It remains a brilliant work by one of the giants of contemporary American literature. The ambiguities involving the disgraced political leader, the disappearance of his wife, and America's role in Southeast Asia continue to resound as powerfully today as when the novel was first written. It is an excellent book, and I recommend it wholeheartedly."
4,Wonderful book so far!!,I really like this book. I haven't even finished the book and in fact I'm not even half-way through. The suspense of John and Kathy is great. I was suppose to read this book during school and now I regret that I didn't...but now I am glad that I decided to pick it up again. I will make another review when I am done with the book.
2,Tedium embodied,This was a tough book to stick through. I found it confusing and repetitous...and upon finishing the book I was left feeling empty because the story never resolved itself. The book looked at the raise and detremental fall of a Politician in Minnesota and how this lead to the disappearence of his wife. It leads the reader through many confusing hypothesis and court depositions to really come up with nothing in the end. I found myself quite disappointed with this book.
2,"OK, I get it already","Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge fan of Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried,"" which is a brilliant portrayal of the Vietnam experience.""In the Lake of the Woods,"" however, came as a disappointment. O'Brien uses language beautifully but the plot of this one is thin. I knew from the first chapter what was going to happen, but continued reading in the hopes that somehow I'd been mistaken. No such luck. The ambiguity (did he kill his wife or not?) praised by other readers held no appeal for me."
4,interesting... another hit from O'Brien,"Tim O'brien caught my attention in his book ""the things they carried"" and again did not disappoint me with ""in the lake of the woods"".. the complex, unique style of O'brien really gets the mind working and keeps the pages turning."
2,I was disappointed with this book.,"This novel does not have enough thematic substance or emotional resonance to carry our interest. The symbolism is heavy handed and the protagonist lacks sympathy. His parents are charicatures, as are the other supporting characters. Kathy, the missing wife, is not developed as a character enough nor is their marriage compelling enough to induce our interest in their fate as a couple or as individuals.The Vietnam War flashbacks lack currency since O'Brien has used more powerful vehicles before. I wanted to like this book because I appreciate O'Brien's vision and humanity, but the book is a major disappointment."
5,Character development from the top down,The use of flashback and fictionalized quotes is weaved seamlessly into this mystery novel. It is a mystery of character as much as of plot as the sequences defined above serve to slowly reveal the personal history of a middle aged couple who are recovering from a recent political setback. As the history unfolds their lakeside retreat takes on more significance as each are struggling with facing the truth about their pasts. A well written and thought provoking work that is difficult to put down. O'Brien's writing on Vietnam is absolutely searing.
3,This book illicits more questions than answers,"""In the Lake of the Woods"" is a cool book. John Wade is a complex character that in more ways than one embodies the personalities of our people todays. Because the book doesn't reveal the truth behind the missing Kathy the fun is in the information about the married couple. I especially liked the part about the evidence and footnotes because it was so different."
1,Held No Appeal for Me,"I REALLY didn't like this book. I don't know if it was the ambiguity (I usually like a good mystery), but I think it was more that it was the characters. I didn't like her and I didn't like him. I loved Tim O'Brien's writing, and will give the author another chance, but this story just didn't hold any appeal for me."
3,The effects of war on the human spirit,"I am sophmore in high school and I just finished this book for my world his. class. I personaly was not intrigued by the plot, I feel O'Brien did not build any deepth to his characters. But I felt compeled by his exploration on the effects of war on the human spirit and I apreciated how he displayed it with collections of quotes.I also feel O'Brien tryed to develop very complex characters but with out making any conections or relevance to the plot."
2,In the Lake of the Woods Book Review,"This book was selected for my book group as this month's choice. I have Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried"" several times and was really looking forward to this book. I can't say that I am disappointed, but that I am perplexed. While I found the chapters recalling John Wade's experience in Vietnam compelling, the Hypothesis chapters and the Evidence chapters left me wanting something more conclusive.In part, the chapters labeled ""Evidence"" made me think that Wade was actually on trial -- literally, though he was figuratively. As a result, I went through a large part of the book thinking that the truth would emerge.All told, I'm still putting the pieces together. I would recommend it, if only because it does make you think. Is it a book I would read again? Probably not."
1,A depressing look at the life of a troubled couple.,"I just finished reading comments of other readers and I disagree with them so strongly that I must express my opinion that this book was depressing, not particularly well written and the characters were so unappetizing that I didn't really care what happened to them. I would have rated this book ""no stars"" but I wasn't given this option."
5,Excellent Builder,"This is a cool system to learn a language--you never see English (that is, you never learn the word in English), so you have to figure it out on your own... just as if you were immersed in the culture. You have to sick with it to make it work, and it's best to combine this with other references (English to Greek, for example).It's not a quick reference guide, nor will get you there instantly, but it works."
3,Pop n Go Pals,"One of the ""pop up"" guys doesn't stay down the best - you have to slam it down pretty hard. Otherwise it is very colorful, noisy and gets their attention. I bought mine for a one year old"
2,mediocre,Very sturdy but somewhat poorly made. The pop-ups stick a little and 2 of them are hard to push all of the way down. This is the first item I have bought from this manufacturer and I will not buy anymore from them.
4,bought 2,"Pretty standard pop up toy, but my 11 mo grandson and 6 mo niece both enjoyed the popping up. My grandson liked trying to get it to do it again. Great standard toy for all between the ages of 6 mo to about 2 years."
3,Classic revived,"Amazing!!!!!!!!Stupendous!!!!!I have been looking for this since I had it on cassette from way back... If you are familiar with BRONZ you need to pick this up. If not, maybe you are familiar with another similar band GTR... Same singer (Max Bacon) at least on this album. If you like Asia, Autograph, early Genesis, GTR, and Yes, I think you will like this."
1,Stopped working after a few months,"This TV also died on us. It's under warranty, but Akai's customer service is horrible. We have been waiting 4 months for a replacement or RA and still nothing."
1,akai tv's suck,"I bought a 46"" big screen from Big Sandy Superstore (with warranty) for a total of $1900. 15 months later, the tv died. Now it's been 6 weeks and Big Sandy says the manufacturer has not supplied the dealership with parts. So basically, after my warranty has expired I will have thrown $1900 down the drain. In the meantime, I have been six weeks without a tv and do not know when the issue will be resolved. Big Sandy will not cooperate such as giving me a loaner or a trade-in. I WILL NEVER buy another akai product and I WILL NEVER buy from Big Sandy Superstores again either. Another example of keeping the corporate thumb on the working class. Also, I am still making payments on the tv and warranty."
4,night beast is campy goofy fun,"Half man/half alien/half piranah face creature terrorizes a small Maryland town.Its sooo 80's its funny.What can I say its gory and crazy its Trauma team.The alien rips out intestines and shoots lazers evaporating whatever it hits....cars,people,buildings etc.Grab your popcorn,beer,whisky and group of friends and laugh and enjoy."
1,Nightbeast.,"The movie was boring,horrible effects and when you see the producers logo come out you see how bad and tacky it really is, I have seen another movie by the same production co that was just as lame. shouldn't be a B-movie, A C-movie. or F."
3,"A good ""country"" scare","This book was really well researched and presented. I did not find it particularly scary, only interesting. A lot of the information was presented in historical perspective and then ""oh by the way, there may be a ghost there now"". Being from the North I found the terminology and quaint sayings peppered thoughout the book a little irritating. So if you are looking for some Tennessee history with a dash of legend and ghost stories then this book might be for you. Otherwise, read Haunted Homeland."
4,Good resource for Athenian society,"While this book covers the usual subjects like geography, religion, social apects, the wars etc., it gives enough information on everything to be the one book on classical Athens that you should have as a reference guide to further study. I used this booking when studying 5th century Athens and found that other books added to the information I got from it, but did not equal or replace its content."
4,Grace Jones...need I say more?,"I loved this movie when I was in high school. My friend and I would rent this movie almost every weekend, this and ""Fright Night."" They are both funny and scary! I bought it because you can no longer find it at Blockbuster. It's still scary and it's still funny. Grace Jones is fantastic!"
3,What Momma Warned Us About...,"..don't hang out with frat hooligans and bikers, don't go into strip bars, never stay out past midnight, and that they call it Skid Road for a reason.Precursor to the fabuloso rave sprinkle of blood scene in Blade and the Tavern at the edge of nowhere on the Mexican border in Dusk to Dawn.And, in a bit of creative casting Grace Jones plays a vampress. You almost never see this on cable, definitely cult, definitely camp."
2,FUNNY,"GRACE JONES IS GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. SHE'S THE QUEEN BITCH! I LOVE THE WAY THEY PLAY WITH THE COOL SHARP COLORED LIGHTING. STUPIED FRAT BOYS ON A MISSION TO FIND A STRIPPER FOR THERE FATERNITY. THEY WIND UP IN A HOLE LOT OF MISADVENTURE AND VAMPIRE TROUBLE. WORTH HAVING IN YOUR COLLECTION. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CHRIS MAKEPEACE,ROBERT RUSTLER AND DEDEE PFEIFFER! HMM???"
2,"Lousy teen sex comedy, an even worse vampire film.","Yeah, this one has your standard set of stock 80s characters, from a couple of sarcastic ""quirky"" jocks to the guy who played Long Duck Dong. Unfunny, grating, and dull are the first words that come to my mind as I ponder this standard ""tryin to get some' plot that's married with a horror film.The only reason I give it two stars is for Grace Jones, who just simply looks cool. Her dance at the club is memorable and for an instant the film finally lifts off. Unfortunately, it's all too fleeting and we are left with the most boring characters running around LA streets at night doing nothing special. Vamp is ultra soft-core lameville -- it's dishonest, impotent gore-light that is the cinematic equivalent of a frat dork bragging about his trip down to New Orleans for Mardi Gras."
3,Could Have Been Better.,"Viewed: 7/11Rate: 57/11: So, what killed Vamp? Simple...Grace Jones. I don't understand why she kept getting acting jobs during the 80's. She was full of it. At least the Rob Lowe look-alike (remember him from A Nightmare from Elm Street Part 2: A Freddy's Revenge?) managed to keep things interesting for me. It's too bad that Dong became a vampire. He could have made the movie more fun to watch had there been more screen time for him. Ditto for Billy Drago who consistently failed to keep up that Billy Idol look, but that was before he became Frank Nitti in The Untouchables. For a while, Vamp was working out very well for me, showing a cross among My Best Friend Is a Vampire, From Dusk Til Dawn, and Fright Night. Then, all of a sudden, it just fell apart and became this boring, typical vampire picture. All in all, Vamp could have been better."
1,horrible...the worst horror movie around!,"i saw it many years ago and i can't forget this movie....""vamp""is stupid,in a word....horrible,awful! i think grace jones didn't know how the fil shoul be....she is unwatchable.....believe me! i usually like vampire movies...but this time i don't..i'm sure of this."
1,DVD-Vamp Warning!,"If you are thinking of buying this DVD, one word-DON'T. The copy I bought had some kind of encrypted virus that ruined my DVD Player. My machine was working fine until I inserted the Vamp disc. It wouldn't play and now no disc will play on my DVD player. I own a video store with several thousand DVDs and believe me Vamp isn't one you need in your collection."
1,the worst vampire movie ever!!!!!,"i read all these great reviews for vamp so i thought ""hay,give it a try. man am i unhappy,how anyone could rate this stinker a 5 is beyond me,and who said grace jones can act or that she's sexy?????? this is just the worst!!!!!!!!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Corny, but great for 'tweens","This movie is corny, corny, corny. Enough T&A; to be classified classic horror, but the vampires are a far cry from the seductive and mysterious vamps of yester-year.And why the hell does dude keep coming back as a vampire with a conscience, and lame sense of humor...?!"
4,Cut above the rest....,"VAMP has much more going for it than most of the 1980's wave of slashy trashy horror films.This film is imaginative and quirky. First of all it stars Billy Drago as an albino thug. Secondly, it stars Grace Jones who was probably born to play the mute but imposing vampiric dancer.The film is surprsingly stylish with stylish green and pinkish hues adding to a strange landscape. This film reminds me of Martin Scorcese's AFTER HOURS. Like AFTER HOURS this has a surreal world just around the corner from normality where oddballs lie in wait and strange events lead into other strange events.The film is not without its faults. The acting can be suspect, though not bad enough to spoil the film, and it can be quite cheesey at times. But, then again, I think this adds to its charm. Buy it!"
3,Grace in Your Face,"Goth this is not. Grace Jones, with body paint and other accessories by Keith Harring, gives a good take on the vampire genre cum Flashdance strippers. The film showcases Grace Jones as postmodern icon; interesting soundtrack from Duran-Duran percussionist."
3,It sounds like the previous two albums,"This is ex White Lion singer Mike Tramp's third solo album. If you like his earlier work (""CAPRICORN"" 1998 & ""RECOVERING THE WASTED YEARS"" 2001) you shouldn't hesitate buying this album because Tramp continues in the same (adult rock) direction. I wouldn't call ""MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS"" an effort in world class but songs like the title track, ""Live for today"" and ""Goodbye song"" stand out a bit from the rest. Critic voices might say that Tramp is writing the same song over and over again, and one can't deny that it's slightly true."
3,Interesting allegory but not Coetzee's best work,"FOE is a retelling of Robinson Crusoe in a dense, moralistic tale narrated from a woman's point of view. Coetzee is not as good here as he is in Waiting for the Barbarians or The Life and Times of Michael K. This novel strikes me as an allegory of the writer's creative process: Defoe as writer (or creative vessel); The ""heroine"" as nurse; Friday as ""dark side,"" resistent to communication; Crusoe as the idea that must be embellished. While I admire Coetzee's creativity and introspection, Foe is not up to Kundera's best works as far as self-referential themes are concerned. If you are a devotee of writing and the creative processes you might like this book; if not, I'd recommend you read Barbarians or Michael K."
4,Liminal Cruso(e),"If you haven't read Robinson Crusoe, this probably won't resonate much. If you're interested in liminal post-modernism, this should strike your fancy. Read it. That's my review."
3,Post-Colonial Novel,"If you're interested in post-colonial novels then this book is for you. However, it's slow and often too mundane to draw emotion. The second of the three sections, to me was underwhelming. Overall it's a good book, wouldn't recommend for anyone who isn't into post-colonial lit."
2,GAHHHH,"I read this book for class. I am an avid reader, have probably read 2000-3000 books in my life, but this one put me to sleep. I read Robinson Crusoe at the same time, and I loved it. It's possible that this soured me to the experience of Foe, but after the real Crusoe, I just couldn't get into a knock-off."
4,Complex,"A rich, rewarding and complex work. Coetzee weaves a masterful tale, which I will not re-examine as other reviewers have so successfully and succinctly done. I can attest to the fact that the novel is precise, erudite and detailed. A lovely work that requires consideration and time."
5,The proof is in the cooking! :),"I would definitely recommend ""O Taste & See."" I had to fix a dish for the media ministry at my church and I chose to try Empress's Brocolli Casserole. It was great! The directions were easy to follow and the cookbook is a joy just to browse through. The media ministry members were really impressed. Thanks Empress!"
3,Interesting Time piece,"This film is a hodgepodge of produced clips from late 60's early 70's rock bands. It is fun to watch to remember that era but it is not a cogent evaluation of music or the 60's ""movement"". I'm a 60's completest so keep that in mind."
3,Grim Tales,Grim and depressing characters with whom I could not connect.I was glad when the book had finished.
2,I've read much better.,"Having read this book a number of months ago, I am only commenting now as Amazon recently sent me an email offer to buy the book. I agree with the other two star reviews.I just did not care for the characters, the story seemed disjointed and the descriptions of the gloomy atmosphere, repetitive.I enjoyed Gita Mehta's ""A River Sutra"" much more, as well as any of the books by Salomon Rushdie that I have read."
1,just could not get into it,"mark helprin: i run home to climb under the covers and devour his work. thats what i want in a writer. someone who captivates me with every page. bukowski: dismal subject matter made painfully fun. the man is a master, simple, honest, writing that makes you weak in the knees. i hate that dont like the inheritance of loss, and i dont, for so many reasons. the writing style is kitschy and experimental. i dont really care for that. the book left me depressed every time i picked it up, and it began to feel like a chore. i would grimace at it from the bed, my reading spot, hating that i literally hate the book. i dont like not liking works of art. and i am deeply saddened to say that it was just not a good read, in my opinion. there was nothing redeeming about it. ps, i got a quarter of the way through it, and started having this thought: 'life is too short. there are so many good books to read. put it down and call it a day.' so i did."
1,Unreadable and Over-rated,"This book is grossly over-rated. I've tried to read it twice but finally abandoned the effort. The characters are flat, the ""wit"" seems to consist mainly of being negative about various characters, and there isn't enough tension to sustain a story. Worse, it's very gimmicky, with lots of words being arranged in arty, quirky ways on the page, usually the sign that content is lacking. Oh, and the over-writing. Puh-LEEZE!I really wonder why this book won the Booker -- good lobbying by Mummy? Short-list and long-list books from last year, such as ""The Secret River"" and ""In the Country of Men,"" were far superior. I seem to have read somewhere that she sent it out to 50 publishers before it was accepted, and I kind of understand."
2,Foggy,"I did not enjoy this book. I read it for a book club and that was the only reason I got as far as I did - I skimmed many pages to see if something interesting was coming up. Alas, nothing ever was. I felt like I was reading this book through a thick fog - I couldn't see the characters or even the setting very clearly because of all the jumping around in time. It was a lot like reading about a dream where the setting and characters change constantly. I also did not like the characters, or perhaps more accurately, the author didn't give me enough insight into their inner lives to care about them one way or the other. And the plotted sucked... it was boring with little action. I give it two stars because the cover was attractive and... I guess that's it. Maybe I should have given it one star. All in all, a boring, lifeless and depressing read. ENJOY!"
5,"Captivating, beautifully written, and heartbreaking","This is a response to those who found the characters lacking in depth and to those who found the book to be boring. My experience was just the opposite. The Inheritance of Loss captivated me, grabbed hold of my emotions and controlled them for days, even after I had finished reading the book. And the characters were some of the best-developed I've experienced in a long time. It's clear that it's simply a matter of tase, because I found Kiran Desai's book to be, put simply, amazing."
5,Compassionate but brutally honest,"How much the world can humiliate a person, turning him inward to self-hatred and destruction. This novel is a sad and exhilarating book to read, the paradoxical nature of living and the human mind is lovingly described in nuanced details, sometimes comical, sometimes tragic, but always brutally honest. Perhaps even love is not the answer, but compassion, forgiveness, of one self and others."
1,"Ennui, a definition","Being late for my flight to Spain I picked up this novel on the basis of its Booker credentials and the fact that other Asian novels I'd read, (midnight's children, kite runner, god of small things etc,) had proved thought provoking and enjoyable reads. I had a two weeks holiday. I did not finish this book. Why on earth was this a Booker prize winner. Was it a sop to the fair sex, the third world, an attempt by the Booker committee to show its street credentials? No characterisation beyond cartoon, no plot at all to speak of and an interminable list of non sequitar activity to lull you into a nice deep sleep. Don't take my word for it. Try and read it all..."
2,Morass of Indulgence,Memorable imagery and command of language. The plot was a slog--lacking pace and energy to sustain the effort to finish it.
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy reading India fiction and thought that this booker prize winner would be a fine book. The characters are unbelievable and you did not get to know them. I couldn't get myself to care about them. I think Desai was trying to copy another booker prize winner, ""God of Small Things"" by her incoherent writing. From an educational standpoint, it also fell short. Did not go deep enough into the turmoil in that region. However, I did get curious about Sikkim and researched it on my own. I do not recommend this book. For India fiction, try:A Fine Balance by Rohinton MistryA Suitable Boy by Vikram SethGod of Small Things by Arundati Roy"
2,Was expecting better,"I've been drawn to literature both fiction and non-fiction whose locale is India. The Inheritance of Loss had received some awards and it seemed to be a popular book. I was so disappointed. If it weren't for the fact that it was my book group's selection I might not have finished it. It was hard to deduce the point of the book. The characters did not seem credible/real. There were many significant characters (too many perhaps), yet none were adequately developed. I didn't even find one characeter that I liked. There was insufficient plot development as well. I was bored, waiting for something to engage me. It never happened."
2,"worthy subject matter, unworthy writing","This book had been sitting on my shelf for sometime before I had the chance to read it. Having finished, I don't regret putting it off. I was very interested in the setting and subject matter of the novel, but found that even as I turned the final pages, I had still not grown to care about any of the characters. Not only did the characters seem flat but were without an intersesting arch-- the cook's son Biju was the one slight exception for me, though his story was unsatisfactorily resolved.I found the writing beautiful in places and messy in others. Yet even the beautiful pieces seemed more like exercises in floridity, than truly artful description. In any case even the most lovely sentence cannot make make the banal extraordinary, though the book seemed like a 350+ page hard fought attempt to do so.I wanted to like this book, and I wish that I had, but it was choppy and uninteresting. Not, I think, worthy of such a high prize."
1,Worst book I ever read,"The whole book is about horrible people who suffer horrible things. I never sympathized with any of the characters. I continued reading the book because I thought it had to get better (it had great reviews), but it never did. If after reading the first ten pages you don't like the book then put it away and don't waste your time with the rest of the book."
2,review of Inheritance of Loss,This book has it's moments buts fall short of living up to a high expectation. The scenarios described are quite depressing with an emphasis on squalor/poverty combined with a sense of helplessness. I was disappointed.
1,Waist of Time,"Very dissapointing and very boring. Never could get into the book. Writing was very choppy, unable to get into a character,and just didn't get the purpose/plot of story line. If it wasn't for my book club picking this book, I would have stopped reading at page 25 and returned book for a refund."
3,So far a bit slow but readable,I have not read but two chapters so far in this book but so far I have not found it to be as appealing as I thought it would. It was recommended to me by my mother (it's her Xmas gift--shamelessly I'm reading it before I wrap it. Who else does this? :-) ) I have found the characters hard to get in to. I love books whose plotlines are located along cultural lines but this one for someone has been difficult. I cannot give it more than three stars so far but I do not wish to give it less because I want to give it the benefit of the doubt as I read on. The language of this book for certain though is rich and filled with imaginative detail. I read on!!
1,Abysmal is an overstatement!,I am surprised that Ms. Desai won the Bookers for this book. It is very poorly written with a lot of cliches and panders to the stereotypes of the Western readers. It is really a sad play wherein she mixes the Gorkha rebellion with a stodgy morbid angry ICS judge and a cook's son in NY. Well - she has tried her best to thread these lives together amid a tumultous political climate - but the thread lacks conviction and unity. The characters are absolutely horribly done - no depth whatsover! I guess the only character that struck out as even a little interesting is the cook and the dead wife of the judge. Ms. Desai tried to mingle a Rushdie and a Mistry -- and has miserably failed. Dont waste your time or money on this. Better to watch Rambo and come out just as empty as reading this book. Except -- u are not disappointed with the former :-)
2,Very negative book on India and immigration,"A very depressing book with a completely unsatisfying ending. The stream of conscience writing was also not effective and mostly just confusing. There are many books about India and most of them have some kind of sad aspect, but this just makes it look awful, and it makes the US look awful on top of that. Very little consideration for the beautiful things in life and the harmony that comes of chaos in India. Only two characters were any good and the other ones we just wanted to get lost. The family dog was the best person in the whole book.Read ""What a Body Remembers"" by Shauna Singh Baldwin if you want a story about India that is both sad and beautiful."
2,Whew! Finished....,"Well, this won the Booker Prize. But so what? By page 175 I realized the story was not going anywhere... What some reviewers may have termed ""vivid,"" I found repetitive. Instead of lively and insightful glimpses into the character's lives, the book goes 'round and 'round the same tedious situations. And none of the situations are positive or uplifting.I don't foolishly think that great literature is always cheerful, on the contrary tragedy - as handed down from the Ancient Greeks -holds the highest place in literature. But this book is not even a good tragedy, it simply drags along in a hopeless and apathetic manner very much like the lives of its characters.It should not take so much paper and ink to tell us about characters who are vapid, selfish, and surly."
2,A literary test of endurance,"The setting is beautifully defined, the characters are colourful. On pretty much every other level, this novel disappoints. The storyline is haphazard and random, and stylistically, it makes for very exhausting reading. The paragraphs are discombobulated. Overloaded with onomatopea, conversational at one point, bombastic the next, The Inheritance of Loss is very difficult to enjoy."
3,A series of poetic still lifes,"Desai has a wonderful way with words, both poetic descriptions and dialogue. The book describes a time of conflict and even revolution in India. So what could possibly go wrong?There is almost no sense of motion in the book. A scene is described; characters talk and emote and consider; then we start the next scene. There is very little that carries the reader from one scene to the next. As the literary equivalent of a ""still life"" the scenes can be quite good, but for a reader hoping to be swept along by a flowing plot, the book can be stilted and disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"As a lover of fiction set in India and an avid reader of books that win the Booker prize, this book had me very disappointed. There seemed to be no point, no closure, too many different tangents and characters. She seemed to be doing a poor imitation of Rushdie."
2,Feeling somewhat cheated,"Like many other reviewers here I was expecting the goods from Kiran Desai. Not just because the Booker Prize committee usually picks good books, but because Ms Desai hails from a rich tradition of good writing (her mother is Anita Desai and there are countless Indian writers who are excellent today).Sadly I was disappointed. The prose is rich to the point of verbose and her characters are unengaging. Beyond a certain point, you wish she'd move on and increase the pace of the novel. It almost felt as if the lush descriptions (which were overly detailed if you ask me) were written as if they were trying hard to impress; instead of cohering together to form a seamless story. This would suggest the novel itself were written in bouts of seperate inspiration- I agree with another reviewer who said the book was only readable a few chapters at a time.Unfortunately, this leaves me wondering if the next Booker Prize winner is worth reading at all."
3,mediocre at best,"I suspect this book has benifited from today's culture of lowered literary expectations. It has gotten such good reviews! But it is not great, nor even ""very good"". However, it's not terrible, either. Just mediocre. The characters are not well-drawn enough for the reader to truly care about their fate, which is just as well as not much happens to them: at least, not enough to feel like a fully fleshed novel."
2,why so much praise for this book?,"don't you hate it when you keep on reading, thinking it will get better... and it never does. a few sentences scattered throughout were poetic, therefore i give it 2 stars. sigh."
1,Yuk,"Like ""reading"" a slow train wreck - achingly dull and painful at the same time. There is no effort to make the reader care about any of the characters - do you really want to feel only alternating disdain and pity all the way through any book? Surely that could not have been the writer's intention?"
2,Kept waiting for it to deserve the accolades...,"After more than a month of reading this book I began to question my tenacity, mindful of my sister's admonition, ""You're old enough to put a book down if you don't like it!"" I agree with other readers here--there was perhaps something beguiling about the occasional lyrical turn of phrase, and I would even go so far as to say the characters were somewhat intriguing. However, the desultory threads were far from woven into a cohesive tapestry. And even though I stuck it out until the end when things attempted to come together, I found myself bitter for having wasted my time!!While I cannot pan it altogether, it was so lukewarm that I must say I question the awards."
1,Fiction in serious need of an editor,"Inheritance of Loss was one of our book club selections, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend the meeting where it was discussed. No matter. I didn't finish the book because it was simply too frustrating and painful to continue reading. The structure -- short, choppy sections on each page -- was to me like watching a dance video that never stops long enough on the dancers to appreciate what they're doing. What's worse, nothing happened that made me want to continue to the next sections and it was a downer the entire time I was reading it. I see from other reviews that some felt the downer mood continues right to the end. I read a lot and am willing to stick with a book if it doesn't grab my attention right from the start, but I'm afraid this one didn't have any redeeming qualities for me. Time is too precious to waste on books that I don't enjoy."
2,This was a big disappointment,I really wanted to like this book. I suffered through it over several weeks hoping it would get better or something would happen that would make it more interesting (or more bearable). I finally gave up about 20 pages from the end. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters and didn't want to waste one more minute of my life to it. Extremely disappointing. I gave it two stars only because it's not the worst book I've ever read (but close).
2,I wanted to love this book but..........,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wanted to enjoy this book, but found that impossible. The author loves words and uses them with elegance; but so many of these words are wasted. The characters and the plot languish in a sea of words."
4,"transports, enlightens, and humanizes with beauty and objectivity","the characters are indelible, the environments of East India and New York are richly detailed and populated, and the political backdrop is taught and enlightening to those who do not read or hear much about the region, which will probably be a majority of readers. So, there is a risk of romanticism and exoticism, but though Desai describes the scenery in beauty, the characters are nuanced."
4,A beautifully written novel.,"This novel, ""The Inheritance of Loss"", is wonderfully written. Desai uses the text in this novel as one would use text in poetry. The histories and interactions of the characters are well executed and sometimes intensely dramatic. This novel depicts how those who are raised under a colonizing nation must either adapt to the post-colonial nation or remain isolated and unwanted.A somewhat challenging read, but a beautifully written book."
1,Over Rated and Boring!,"Not an expert but I think this book is highly over rated. Its not only wordy, lacks to keep readers' attention and stereotypes characters but also found it to be offensive at times. To the writer's credit, the story does pick up towards the end but its still not worth the time."
2,Not so good,I didn't know the characters in this book or care about them at all. It felt stagnate. Not an enjoyable read for me.
2,Starts strong and quickly dissipates so... don't bother.,"I used to love the Booker prize short list - used to try to read them all before the prize was annouced but lately......?This book opens with some beautiful, lush writing that draws you in then it gets too clever with its structure and flash backs, etc, to bother to sustain the writing quality. So you shouldn't bother to start it."
3,Good writing depressing characters,The author does a great job of capturing culture and the gaps between them. The story is full of character histories and struggles that stir a wide range of emotions.You will get even more out of this if you are familar with India's history and culture. A good book club selection.
2,Difficult to read,"I found this book very hard to read and understand. I will be honest, I really couldn't finish the book. I just didn't find it captivating. There was nothing in the book urging me to read. I tried forcing myself to finish it due to the Booker Prize, but to no avail. I like books with a story to tell that are both thrilling and entertaining. This book offered me neither. But to be fair, I hated reading Shakespeare back in school, and found his books hard to understand and not entertaining at ALL! Ask me today, and I'd tell you Shakespeare's books are a masterpiece. Maybe I need to wait a few more years, and understand life better to really appreciate 'The Inheritance of Loss.' Otherwise, why would it have won the Booker Prize?"
2,Man Booker Winner??,"Who determines these award winners? Do they bother reading the book? How were all the typos missed? They must not have finished as a big one on next to last page of my copy, ""She stopped to cook?"" should have read 'look' and another error in this one sitting (nthey), which was my last, thankfully!! I feel like I should get an award for finishing this book. No more MBP winners for me. Surely they can do better!!"
4,Legacy of free speech to her kinsmen and the world at large,"This book is simply a work filled with detailed precisions and brilliant utterances. I would have to ponder on the cost of free speech to the young nubile author from the third world Asian nation who mustered up courage and audacity to publish inequities dealing with anguish and helplessness vis-a-vis the benefits the author and her people will have reaped from asserting their presence and rights. Wide readership will assure that her efforts is not futile and recognition will alleviate the great weight of ""tyrannical majority"" against which the author has taken great strides."
2,Like wading through mud in the fog.,"I found it neither interesting or entertaining.The story line is constantly interupted and in places almost kalidescopic.I found that too much attention paid to what seemed to be superfluous detail was a debilitating detraction from the story which I found difficult to connect with.The characters were one dimensional and the plot unconvincing.I do not like having to ""study"" and in some cases re-read each sentence in order to discern the plot which by the end of chapter 6 I got past caring anyway.I am sorry but it did not deliver for me."
3,Not my fave book but worth reading (Warning: Story spoiler),"This book was beautifully written, with lyrical descriptions and interesting characters. I enjoyed most of the book but was ultimately disappointed by the author's apparent laziness. I kept reading, though, and finished it, which says something for the power of the writing.**Warning: Story spoiler...stop reading if you hate to know details before you read a book -- If you love dogs, you will cry buckets on the last page. Just a warning."
2,Do not waste your time,I started to read this as a member of a book club. 30 pages in and I was yawning with boredom at the endless flowery descriptions that added nothing to the story. I tried but I could not get through more that 100 pages before I just took it to a book swap hoping to recoup something. I guess if you write about politically correct topics you can win awards.
3,"(3.5 stars) Beautiful writing, tedious story","I finished The Inheritance of Loss a few weeks ago and have been mulling it over since then....and I still feel rather ambiguous about it. The writing is lyrical, beautiful, moving - I only wish I could heap such praise on the plot/characters.Without any spoilers (and without repeating what's been covered in other reviews), the characters all pretty much ended up full circle - they started miserable and ended miserable. Kind of made me wonder what the whole point was - did the characters learn anything in the course of the story? Didn't seem like it to me.There were also a lot of factual and historical references to India and Indian culture, which being unfamiliar with, was a little hard to digest at times...footnotes would have been appreciated, and possibly added to my understanding/liking of the book.All in all, I don't like or dislike this book, but it speaks volumes that I felt nothing for it."
4,Enthralling But Grim Picture,"This novel is set in a relatively isolated village in India, with characters ranging from poor to upper middle class. A secondary setting is Manhattan where undocumented immigrants work in squalor and try to survive. The picture of life in India is one I had never seen, and the picture of the impact of British rule is far from complimentary. Character development, plot and historical context are all quite strong, leading to a bittersweet ending. I thought this work was a little drawn out toward the conclusion, which is the only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars."
2,This should have been a short story,"This book dragged on and on and on. The entire novel consists of character development until the last couple of chapters. This book ends in the same style as her book ""Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard""; there is no resolution, but it doesn't seem at all like she takes this tack in order to leave things up to the reader... she merely ends the book about 3 chapters shy of the actual end of the story. Unlike Hullabaloo, however, this book wasn't much fun, wasn't very clever, blah blah blah. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I learned a little bit about Indian history."
1,"Rambling story, contrived characters","This book is rambling and lacks cohesion. Don't expect to connect with any of the characters, since they appear so randomly and scattered that you'll barely have a chance to get to know them in depth. Rather, they appear to be the author's puppets in what should instead have been a nonfiction work: one that provides a scathing sociological commentary about the cross-generational legacy of emotional violence. The writing just doesn't flow . . . don't waste your time."
1,A bore...,"One wonders how some of these litterary prizes are awarded? Political correctness (by a woman, concerning minorities, etc) seems to be the norm. Or is it that the jury wants to show that THEY understand what's great and show us the public that we DON'T.The French awards are bad because there is little of value written in that language today. A group of snobs gathers at a fancy restaurnant and decide what the public should read: generally it misfires. Tthe English litterature is plentiful, yet the winnners mostly end up as duds.This one takes the cake. A waste of time and money."
1,lost on me,"I agree with many of the recent poor reviews. This book is a chore to read - I felt like I needed to have a dictionary at hand every time I sat down to read this book. I am halfway through and rarely give up on a book, especially one that is as highly praised as this, but my reading time is too precious to waste on a story that seems to be going nowhere."
1,Adolescent at best,"How did this book win the Booker Prize? Have we become so enthralled with cultural and political diversity that we applaud a poorly done work of fiction simply because it attempts to address the humanity of political issues never minding literary prowess. This story reminds me of the writing in my teenage diary.In my humble opinion, this book's winning the Booker is a grand example of a parallel event to the one in Anderson's Emperor's New Clothes."
1,Poor reading..... poor writing,"I agree with so many of the bad reviews that this book got. Initially I questioned my taste and ability to appreciate a Booker winner but then.... what the heck! I don't like it, I don't like it. Some of the writers that won the Booker have become my all time favorites. Ian McEwan brings out one masterpiece after another and I eagerly wait for his next work, Arundhati Roy, even though does not write fiction anymore still touches my heart with every topical article she writes. And Margaret Atwood, John Updike etc. do not need commendations from me to be known as brilliant writers, who also one Bookers. Kiran Desai on the other hand according to me does not belong to the same league. The characters in this book are simply.... boring! There are many other good books out there for you to savor. Spend your precious time on them."
2,"Does not live up to its hype, unfortunately.","I have been immersing myself in Indian novels lately. I looked forward to this one with much anticipation. However, although there were a few spots of truly brilliant writing, with wonderful insights, the novel fell flat most of the way through.The plot line in India was very weak, the characters did not really seem developed at all, particularly the girl, Sai. The only character with a little development was the grandfather, a most unsympathetic character. The plots involving Sai and Gyan, and Gyan and the insurgents, were especially weak points in this book.The plot involving the cook's son in America was much better developed, and frankly, was the only thing that redeemed this book at all.The book didn't end so much as it just kind of petered out from lack of steam. No conclusions, no nothing.Very disappointed in this book."
4,Good overall single. (Actually 4.5 stars),The song is great.The Crystal K Remix is not very good.The Dead Or Alive Remixes are excellent.Nervous and Hide And Seek are great.The Album Megamix is a treat and great.Why did this single not include the great video?Half a star taken for the rubbish Crystal K Remix.Better than the UK seperate releases.Simple as that.
4,"Good performance, a bit noisy.","These rotors are quality workmanship, but it's my first time having slotted/dimpled rotors and they are kind of noisy. The only way to find out (other than installing them) is to look in the FAQ of the manufacturer's website. They are not quiet like a normal OEM rotor. Otherwise my car stops great and I have no complaints about the performance."
5,CLASSIC!,"I basically grew up on this and ""Headless Horseman Rides Tonight"". This is something that you can appreciate whether you're a child or an adult, especially if you're like me and you checked it out of the school library religiously. There was a review that said it was ""unsuitable for children"", ummmm yeah sure. As someone who was reading this book at the age of eight years old I can say that it helped expand my imagination and got me really interested in literature. One day I hope my little nephew will read this book and experience the same joy I did when I was little."
4,"Great cadence, great illustrations","The reader who didn't like this book needs to lighten up. Kids love spooky, scary stories. Just ask the Brothers Grimm! This book has wonderful, simple poems with a beautiful rhythm. Perfect for bedtime reading.The book is not gory at all. Sure it mentions eating children and such, but look at Hansel & Grettle or the Three Bears! Ah well. I highly recommend this book for anyone, child or adult, who enjoys fun, creepy poetry and bleak, haunted illustrations. Wish I'd found this book when I was a kid. I'd have loved it!"
5,Its the best!,This cd is soooooo good i have reccomended it to many pepole this cd rules!I have pracically melted it!
4,A Return With Mild Disappointments,The classics are played with a few surprises in there. The two new songs could be really good if it wasn't for Ozzy's lacking lyrical ability. Geezer wrote most of the lyrics in the old days. Ozzy can sing but he just isn't a poet (Perry Mason ring any bells?) Sound quality is kinda blah. The guitar seems to kind of disappear in some points.
4,Sabbath's Best Live Album,"This live disc is so great. Sabbath plays all of the songs perfectly, probably cause they were all sober at the time. The tracklist is composed mostly of the songs from ""Black Sabbath,"" ""Paranoid,"" and ""Master of Reality,"" but there are some surprises. ""Dirty Women,"" ""Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath,"" ""A Spiral Architect,"" and of course the cocaine ballad ""Snowblind"" are all included. The two new tracks ""Psycho Man,"" and ""Selling My Soul"" are both decent. ""Psycho Man"" is kind of cheesy, but ""selling my soul"" isn't, which subsequently makes it the better of the two new tracks. However; ""Psycho Man"" is the only track that has all four members playing. ""Selling My Soul"" does not feature Bill Ward on drums. The only problem musically, is on ""Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath;"" the band doesn't perform the whole sludge part of the song before ending it( if you're a Sabbath fan, you know what part of the song I'm talking about). Anyways...this cd is sweet!"
3,nothing new,Nothing entirely Original here. Black Sabbath sounds live about the same as they do otherwise. The two new tracks are intresting but nothing that great. IF your a diehard fan buy this album. if not spend your money and by the some original sabbath.
5,ITS BLOODY COOL,I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A OZZY FAN AND A BLACK SABBATH FAN I SEEN THE REUNION TOUR LIVE AND HAVE THE CD SET ITS AWESOME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL HEAVY METAL FANS
1,Total Waste,"I've been a diehard Sabbath fan since the first album. I have stood by Sabbath through thick and thin and eagerly awaited their reunion - but this CD is nothing less than an embarrassment. The music is flat, offkey; Ozzie is a zombie attempting to make up for not being able to sing by screaming ""f***"" through the whole concert. The audience sings more than Oz. I was sorely disappointed - but I will always be a loyal fan."
1,SAD MEETING,"Everything here sound fake: the audience, the overdubs made by the band in the studios (mainly to cover Ozzy and Ward limitations). Another wrong move by Tony Iommi, who is destroying the band forever."
1,A SAD MEETING LEADING TO A EMBARASSING ALBUM...,"Fans sometimes can't see the truth. and keep giving this garbage a five-star rating. I Love SAbbath with Ozzy, always have, always will ! I own all their records with Ozzy (and with Dio). SO I can honestly say: this CD is horrible. THe band is totally without pace and tightness, agressiveness also is lacking here. Ozzy is losing his voice, Ward was always the weakest part (technically speaking)and is worst than ever. The sound of the recording is buffed, distorted, the audience is very high. The album is clearly overdubed in studio from beginning to ending. There's not here a true Sabbath fan will have to want. Ozzy's ""SPEAK OF THE DEVIL"" (1982) is one-hundred times better than this. I think TOny Iommi should finish Sabbath forever and form a new band, recruiting some big shot musician to share with him the burden of composing songs and starting a new project. Please, leave the Sabbath's myth intact while you still got time !"
4,exellent for a begining not enough for a reunion,este disco es imponente ya que produce un sentimiento de locura al escucharlo que solo black sabath nos hace sentir lo unico que lamente fueron improvisaciones en guitarra y a ozzy cantanto war pigs solo y no a medias con el publico
5,THEY ARE STILL IRON MEN!!!!!!!,"They are back and louder than ever, this CD shows that they still have it in them, sure they f@#^ up a little, but that just makes it feel more like the real thing. I love how Ozzy make the crowd sing, and how he gets everyone to join in. The two studio tracks are incredible as well. Especially ""selling my soul"", which is done superbly. IF U LIKE SABBATH, U MUST OWN THIS ALBUM!!!!!! AND IF U ARE JUST STARTING, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM TO BEGIN WITH!"
4,A good album,"Let me make something clear. I am a new Sabbath listener, and I regret not having listened to them a little earlier (though I am young). I'm appalled by Ozzy's continuous use of the F word all the time. For God's sake, he has 3 children of his own already. Does he let them hear this kind of music? The Sabbath songs are good though, great in fact. Iommi is a great guitarist. However, I reccomend this album to hardcore Sabbath fans only. Buy the original recordings and you won't have to listen to all the annoying clapping and the public singing the songs for Ozzy. The only thing that really makes this CD worth getting is the 2 new songs, especially ""Psycho Man"" (which is the first song to have ever given me the creeps). I know one thing for sure though, I'm going out to buy something like ""Paranoid"" (CD) soon."
4,Brilliantly flawed,"As an older fan of Black Sabbath, I find the new REUNION brilliantly flawed. Technically the double CD is a masterpiece. It's like they never left. The band is awesome in their musical power. However, I was sorely disappointed by Ozzy's continued use of the F-word. I have nothing against such lyrics, but his usage took away from the performance. Also, this would have been the perfect vehicle to introduce my kids to the glory and fury of Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath lyrics speak volumes, Ozzy's gratuitous use of the language takes one star away from a great album that could have been super."
3,I am sorry but Ozzy can't sing anymore,"I am a die hard black sabbath fan (although I am not a fan of their lyrics). I used to and still love Iommi's guitar and Ozzy's evilish vocal which migle well with their group name Black Sabbath. Naturally I bought this album to expect their tunes hopefully in better recording quality because their first 5 albums still haven't been digitally remastered. By listening to this CD, I realized that the old chemistry wasn't there anymore. Particulary, Ozzy's vocal is in sad shape. He contantly encourages crowd to sing and most of the time sings one octave lower cause can't sing the high notes anymore. Overall stick to their studio CDs."
4,Defininitive Sabbath Live Set,"After three previous live albums that all left something to be desired, Reunion finally gives die-hards like myself what we've been waiting for. Except for the blasphemous exclusion of any material from the Sabotage album, this live set should cover Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne era to the satisfaction of all fans. The two new studio tracks, however, are another story, and cost the album a star IMO. Again, though, any fan of Sabbath and/or Ozzy should find the live set well worth the money spent."
4,Only for serious Sabbath Fans,"Althoug I love Sabbath, and the two songs at the end were worth the cost of it, I'd like to say this Sabbath album is for serious Sabbath fans only, I perfer the studio versions of all of the live songs. This albm is not for those of you who when you hear someone mention Black Sabbath, you say ""oh yeah, 'Iron man'"", or ""I think I've heard paranod"". Still overall, it is a great album. If these two studio tracks are any indicator of their next studio album, oh yeah, we're in for it."
4,A Showcase of Sabbath,"Essentially this is a greatest hits album, and some songs sound better than others. In a nutshell, any Sabbath fan should have this. Otherwise, you might want to stick with one of the greatest hits compilations or getting the original albums."
3,good but not great,"I heard these cds and instead of buying them i got the black sabbath ""the ozzy osbourne years"" which is a 3 cd's of 5 lps. And they are much better and more raw. get the ozzy years instead. If u like this type of music check out motley crues shout at the devil album and dr. feelgood ."
4,"Great, but Ozzy ruins it","What's here is awesome, but Ozzy ruins it all by dropping the F-bomb at least 10 times per track- it's no big deal at first, but wears thin quickly (""Come on! Clap your f---ing hands!! You're not f---ing loud enough! I can't f---ing hear you!"" etc.) If you can get past that, it's well worth it."
1,Not one of their better Efforts,"I have numerous Sabbath Albums/CDs along with many of their live outings. This is clearly the poorest performed of them all. Even though this is one with the Oz on board, it truely is not a good performance at all. This CD is only for the true Sabbath fan that must have it to form a complete collection. If you're looking for a Live Sabbath album to get into, go with Past Lives or others. Stay clear of this one..."
4,Good Black Sabbath Live Effort...but not the best live of the Osbourne era,"Amazing Live Sound...Good show Production...Excellent Performance...Too many ""Fu*****"" words for Ozzy Speech between songs...In other words: Good Black Sabbath Live Effort...but not the best live of the Osbourne era"
1,Godawful.,"This is the first album I've ever heard where I sorta WISH they'd used Auto Tune. Ozzy's terrible and has been since No Rest For The Wicked. Terrible, terrible album, and a disgrace to the legacy of one of the greatest bands of all time."
1,not sabbath,"black sabbath sux since they cancelled their colorado tour after postponing it twice i won""t ever buy another sabbath or ozzy cd again and i was a big big fan of both"
1,Horrible sound,"This sounds like it was recorded on a dictaphone via a telephone. ""Direct Source Special Products Inc.""should be ashamed of putting out junk like this.Thank God I didn't pay for this CD."
5,Great,My daughter was really excited. She loves disney movies and she loves the princesses. She loved this look and find.
5,Good Learning,this book is soo good my daughters love it so much ..it develops thier sence of observation .. and it's so intresting with the princesses scenesi recommend it .
1,hatrid,i hated this it was wyyy to hard for any kid under the age of 5so i dont like it thats allbyeeee!
4,Hours of fun for your little one!,"My daughter is 2 and this is currently her favorite ""book"". It is similar to the I Spy books but features the Disney Princesses in their respective settings. Each scene features 6 to 8 hidden items for your child to find. The pictures are exciting and colorful. It is fairly simple to find each item but a definite fun challenge for a pre-schooler, especially if they love the Disney Princesses! My daughter loves doing the same scene over and over again to see if she can remember where the selected items are hidden. The only downside is that I wish there was more of a story paired with each scene."
4,Fun to look at,"I got this book for a Christmas present for my 2 year old daughter. At first it was a bit challanging because there is a lot going on in the pictures, and on some pages the pictures in the key are not the same as the pictures in the book. But after a few sit downs together she is able to find all of the pictures on her own. It gives her a great since of accomplishment to be able to do so. It is lots of fun."
3,cute but lackluster artwork inside and paper pages,"I have bought a few of the toddler ""First Look and Find"" books and was shopping for more as gifts for a 1-2 year old range when I bought this. I guess I just assumed it would be like the others. When it arrived, I realized it is a hardbound book with thin paper pages, not a board book like the others. I also expected it to have rich, bright colors on every page, like the other look-and-find books I've seen, but the colors were very muted and the scenes on every page seem much less sharp and clear than even the other Disney brand books.I rated it a 3 out of 5 stars because of the lackluster quality of the artwork inside. I expected more of Disney."
2,"Nice book, but not many pages","This book is nice, but man this is small. There are only a few pages and this book is wafer thin. I wish there was a few more pages to it."
4,Princess look and find,Great look and find book for younger girls. Ages three to five. Even the adults had fun looking. Pretty pictures too!
5,Fantastic book for little girls who love princessess!,Our Granddaughter Aubrey Elizabeth is three and she wanted her mama to go page by page through this whole book in the middle of seeing all of her gifts. She loves her princesses..............
3,the pictures are not the same,"my 5 year old daughter likes this book, but, the pictures in the ""to find"" list do not match the ones in the big picture. For example, on the Cinderalla page, Jaq is in the picture but is in a different position. We aren't sure if this is a match or not."
3,Too Complicated for My 2 year old,"I own other Look and Finds and compared to this one, it was just too hard for my 2 year old, and even trying for myself to find the items. In other Look and Finds, the picture that you are asked to search for is exactly as shown in the book. In this one, it is not too size, and not exactly as image, for example, look for the camel in the scene and only the head of the camel is shown. The rest of the body is hidden behind a tree. Or it asks you to look for a ying yang. In the scene, it was a smaller ying yang in the palm of someone's hand. The scenes are very busy, similar to a Where's Waldo scene. I have to put it away, as my 2 year old gets frustrated if it takes her too long and i don't want her to get turned away by it. It will definitely be a challenging fun thing to do, maybe in few more years."
3,Fun for a while....,"My daugther loved this book the first couple of times she went through it but the objects aren't that hard to find and she was bored with it quickly. Still, the excitement she got from going through it the first time was worth the cost! Maybe she'll forget where everything is in a few months and it will be exciting again."
5,Sweet!,I bought this for my niece because she loves Disney Princess's. This is a very cool book for girls especially if they like Princess's.
3,sticky??,the cover is ok. its hard to put it in your pocket because of it being so sticky. we bought one that is more of a plastic case.
1,get Cataloging & Classification by Chan instead,The book consists largely of reprints out of the AACR2. These are used as examples but its largely to cover up a almost complete lack of explanatory material.I'm sorry I purchased this text and everyone else in my class had similar feelings about the book. It explained almost nothing about the cataloging rules nor did it illustrate why certain cataloging decisions had been made in its examples.Its a good thing the professor is an excellent lecturer or I'd be completely lost.
1,no power,"I recieved the gun 9 days after I ordered it. When I opened it, it looked okay. then It took me an hour to figure out how to get the battery cover off and after I charged the battery, I tested it out and It had absolutely no power to it. It only shot about 15 ft."
1,This is perhaps the worst airsoft gun ever made!!!,"I don't know what J.Spencer is smoking but this is the worst gun that i have purchased. After receiving my fourth replacement of this gun because the all fell apart right when you take it out of the box, i decided to get the Tokyo Marui AK-47. The deferences were astounding. Plus the Tokyo Marui gun looks 10 times more realistic. [I love how Amazon lies and says it is better then the Tokyo Marui] They Should be sued. The crappy gun shoots 220 fps witch is ok for a low grade gun. It also shoots low grade bbs .12gs to be exact witch makes it much more inaccurate. Do not buy this gun!!!!! Look At Tokyo Marui brand, Classic Army brand, they are much better guns. I think That J.Spencer works for Amazon and is writing a good review for this gun so people will buy it."
2,Works Pretty good -- IF,"If you can buy this camera for under $20, it's probably a good deal. Picture quality is not the best, but OK, However, don't buy this if you are running Microsoft Vista as your operating system, because this camera will not work with Vista."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"Overall, this product does what the basic web camera does. It shows your video. For the price, it's not worth it. The low light vision is bad, and even in high light, the picture tends to be grainy. It has a manual focus that is hard to get right. It's a convenient size, but the hold is weak on the laptop. I bought it from Target as well, since it was on clearance for 25 dollars. I wish I hadn't. I bought it for my HP notebook, and was much more satisfied by the Logitech webcams."
1,Terrible Picture,the pic is blurry. I tryed to adjust it. 29.99 I bot @ target store. Im ganna lye & take it back. the picture contrast is very bad. I updated the software it make no differnace. this cam year is 2005. Good luck to every one else out there. for 29.99 u could get a good one. I thot I would give it a try.
4,The Black Rose,I have loved this movie for years. My mom took me to see it as a child. We stayed to watch it twice because I liked it so much. We even got in trouble with my dad for being out so late. I like the blond woman's accent who played the part of the Rose. I've never seen her in anything else again. I often wonder what happened to her. This is a wonderful Marco Polo type movie. I believe the man who played the lead male role passed away some years ago.
3,It is what it is,I had just read the Power biography and wanted to see a few of his films and this was a great price for 5 of his better know roles. They are all just ok no real winners and he never seemed to have to work to hard in them. Probably only for real die hard fans
5,Love at the movies,Growing up I saw old Tyrone Power movies on television. Even deciding to buy this collection I had not remembered how great he was on the screen. His co-stars are of equal standing and each of these films can stand alone on their merit. The filming & scenary! His talent lights up the screen in each. If you like classic Tyrone-you will never regret buying this collection-it is a must have.
4,The Black Rose,"Enjoyable old movie with what could best be described as a ""laid back"" performance by Orson Welles. Not a classic but watchable."
1,worst power movie i've ever seen,"Very disappointed in this one. Jack Hawkins is wonderful as always. Welles good, too. But, the girl, Aubrey, is simply terrible. I think she's the worst leading lady that Power ever had to cope with. I would like to know who cast her in this, maybe she was Zanuck's girl at the time?? No acting ability, no looks. My favorite Power movies are The Razor's Edge and Nightmare Alley."
1,Power Rendered Impotent,"""The Black Rose"" = stinkweed. Its unprepossessing plot is shot full of holes. The poorly drawn characters are generally unsympathetic. Consider the atrocious casting of the film's leading roles: mature, very American Tyrone Power as a young Oxford scholar; juvenile French actress Cecile Aubry--as the (unconvincing) romantic interest--is about as sexually devastating as a kewpie or cabbage-patch doll. The film's leaden pacing, its prolix and unremarkable dialogue, its profound lack of credibility as well as its failure to appeal to any other emotions than this viewer's boredom and contempt result in my judging ""The Black Rose"" as one of the worst films Tyrone Power ever had the ill fortune to make.This otherwise undeserving DVD release does include a single interesting special feature: a Power Family Reunion featurette, in which Tyrone's son, two daughters, and second wife sit down and reminisce about him."
3,Ty & Orson: Take Two,"Welles and Power reunite for a follow-up to Prince of Foxes, though amiable, that's not nearly as good. The plot meanders around and never really gets a good footing in it's globe-trotting storyline. The very talky early scenes set in England are the most interesting and are the best acted portions. Unfortunately, Ty is saddled with a role that seems ill suited to his age - he's almost a juvenile here. (Plus, what is with the positively infantile female lead!) Orson shows up for the later scenes set in the Middle East and these are curious, but marred by some dubious stereotypes, poorly over-dubbed."
3,It's not anything from the other world,"-A really poor CD which only contains a pair of good tracks, the CD doesn't deserve too much attention, the tittle of this CD is not related at all to the tracks, it only hides the truth from this CD: It's not worth it. I rated average, but I guess if you look for Dance you should look other parts not here. If you ever buy this CD, you'll remember my words. By the way, the sequel of this CD is on the way, and that one really is a collector's CD containing incredible songs from the best artists."
2,Fair enough,This cd has 10 eurodance songs. A fair cd. But it might not be worth buying unless you like this cd.
4,Digne de mention,"Balance of Power nous presente son 5 ieme album et un nouveau chanteur en John K ,Cet album confirme l'énorme potentiel de ce groupe, il est puissant et mélodique au maximum, du power métal à son meilleur. Le nouveau chanteur fait un excellent travail, on croirait mme parfois entendre Mr Geoff Tate de Queensryche, j'oserais dire que c'est à s'y méprendre.L'album contient 9 titres bien dosés, les claviers sont omniprésent sans prendre trop de place.Le son est énormepour ceux qui ne connaissent pas Balance of Power, je dirais que le groupe se situe entre Queensryche et Symphony X.Je vous conseille non seulement cet album mais aussi ses 4 prédecesseurs."
5,A Magnificent Tale,I found this collection of novelas to be magnificent. I didn't want to put it down. At one point I acutally cried. The characters become so real to you that you are moved with their pain and elated in their victories. I also found them spiritually uplifting. Now I just wish I could go see the places that were so wonderfully discribed.
2,"Too much of the happy, sappy, goody-goody to be realistic.","I picked this book up because I'm going to Alaska and wanted to get myself excited for the trip; unfortunately, this book really didn't help much. Although it did get into the Iditarod, dog sledding, and blizzards, it really did not cover the culture of living in Alaska like I thought it would--and let's not even talk about the characters. As a Christian woman, some parts of the book (such as Rita Eriksson's fight to be independent of God) were definitely realistic; however, in the end it seemed as if every single character, even the less important ones, were model Christian citizens, and because of that these stories lost much of their [realistic] appeal."
4,Fascinating piece of work on the Stewart line,"The work of an articulate spokesman for the Stewart Legitimist cause, this is a well-constructed compilation of peerage creations under the Stewart monarchs, followed by chapters listing knights, diplomatic and household appointments, declarations of noblesse, etc. The introductory chapter on nineteenth century Legitimist activities is also quite interesting . . . and a little strange."
3,But the CDs instead...,Her mother's messages are so funny...but they're interrupted with the explanations. It's definitely not as funny to read a stand-up comedian's routine...skip the book and get the CDs!
3,fun,"I read this book cover to cover in no time at all. It's fun, pretty funny, but once it's done, it's done. While I liked it, it also didn't really leave much of a lasting mark on me... But it is worth reading once.... then... I gave it to a friend... I would buy a used copy, don't spend your money on a new one."
5,Great book....,"Got this book as a gift last week and still laughing!!! Sounds like my mother to a tee, with all the extreme worrying and the unnecessary warnings. There were several phone messages in the book that weren't on Amy's Answering Machine CD. The comments and jokes in her book were right on the money. A real riot!"
3,It was okay,"This book was just okay for me. It was funny, I did laugh, but I finished it in about an hour. For $11 I wanted something more, it was just way too short."
4,Never be without an extra tote,"I picked up two of theseKiva Key Chain Totes. One I kept for myself and one I gave as a gift. The size is perfect for keeping in your car, purse, coat pocket or as advertised as a key chain. These are especially nice to have when you don't think you'll need a bag. At a fair, beach combing, unplanned trip to the market and the list can go on. I wasn't too picky about the print so I went with the two that were least expensive (currently Animal Print and Peace). At less than $6, it was worth all the plastic bags I'll avoid bringing home and the recipient liked hers too."
2,Too small,It's kind of flimsy and too small for travel. Might be OK for carrying around groceries. I ended up returning it.
5,Tote,Light weight bag to take anywhere. Very helpful for carrying lots of small purchases. Great gift idea.
3,"Too much talk, not enough plot.","I was mildly disppointed in the fifth Kate Delafield mystery. Unlike the four previous volumes, Liberty Square did not always keep me on the edge of my seat. The main problem, it seems to me, is that a full 25% of the book is devoted to -- literally -- Old War Stories. On the up side, the plot twists that do occur are clever and unexpected, and Forrest's depictions of realistic lesbian characters and relationships continue to ring true.All in all, this material would have made a great novella or short story, but with page after page about how tough it was back in Nam, it doesn't make a very good mystery novel, or at least not as good as the previous installments. Read the stunning ""Murder at the Nightwood Bar"" instead! Or, better yet, start at the beginning and read the entire series in order, and by the time you get to ""Liberty Square"" you'll be so involved in the characters that you won't mind that it's a little slow-paced."
2,An interesting story but needed more fully drawn characters,"Liberty Square was a good idea squeezed into too few pages. Memories of the war in Vietnam weren't really fleshed out, leaving me with the feeling that Forrest was rushed or over edited. The plot twists held a good number of surprise, but I would have liked to see the other characters (especially the male characters) more fully drawn. I've only read one other book by Katherine Forrest so her references to past events in Kate Delafield's life left me both curious and frustrated. I don't mind reading past books, but I don't think it should be necessary in order for me to understand what motivates the main character or where she is in her life. Especially if that past is vital to the story."
3,"is about anger, power, justice and people","Basti, the posters claim, is about anger, power, justice and people. In other words, it is about a B-grade Bollywood flick.It has all the ingredients - blood, blood, and some more blood - in overdose, with a dash of rapes, and garnished with a few midriff- and cleavage-baring bimbettes. There is a multitude of baddies who are out to wrong the dwellers of the hero's basti. And, of course, the police are neck-deep in it all."
1,Not worth even one star,"It's three o'clock in the morning and I haven't been to sleep yet because of the noise of my brand new unit. It sounds like I'm on a small jet just about to take off. And with all the noise, one would think the temperature would drop--but no, it's been 80 degrees since I turned it on high 10 HOURS AGO!!I am angry and disappointed. This is getting returned today."
1,Not happy,The sound is way too quiet and the inner ear piece broke off after 2 days. It would have to be sodered back on. That's what you get for a 10 dollar earpiece.
1,Died as soon as water touched it,Biggest POS I ever wasted a buck on. Was under my shirt for half an hour and died from sweat. Don't waste your money or time.
5,Benny & Sara learn how feels like when the Massia is here,Benny is going to go to the store with Sara and then the Massia comes!They are filled with joy and all the things change from bad to good!
5,Because of Salome,"I give this five stars mainly because of Nilsson's ""Salome."" She was the curtain closer for this event as she was for the farewell to the old Met gala for which she sang Wagner's ""Immolation."" And the climactic moment for the met Centennial celebration was her ""Spottleid"" from ""Tristan und Isolde."" That and her extemperaneous offering of a Swedish folk song.And for James Levine's 25th year at the Met celebration, Nilson had the last word, or rather the last ""Ho Jo to ho Jo,"" sung acappella at the age of seventy-six or seventy-seven. They always saved the best for last, perhaps as a reminder there were indeed some Golden Age Giants among us, and as Met General Manager Schulyer Chapin said , ""Nilsson was her own golden age."""
3,Bowman fan,"This will not be an objective review. I like Tim Bowman. I like his offering entitled Paradise. He musically speaks to me in much the same way as the late Wes Montgomery. Bowman's apple crisp sound comes through song after song. And I don't tire of it. Grab a listen and see for yourself on the title cut 'Paradise'. On 'The Journey Home' Kirk Whalum's sax interplays with Bowman strings - its like I can picture driving the last mile to mom's house. Now that after I 've driven the entire trip with this CD playing in the car. But remember, this is not an objective review. I like Tim Bowman."
5,"""They Loved the Land""","I've been wanting this book for a while, but there were very few available and much too expensive. My parents and grandparents are fromFoard County and some of my ancestors are mentioned in the book. The price finally came down to something I could handle and I'm very happy tohave the book as part of my genealogy research. It is in very good condition and the shipping was very speedy. After receiving it I found outit was a discarded library book from Abilene Christian University in Abilene, Tx which happens to be where I went to college for 2 1/2 years manyyears ago. Love it!!"
3,"Boring, I'm Sorry to Say","At first, I was all enthused to receive this book because I had been looking for a general overview of what the gnostic gospels were all about for some time and I thought this would be a fun and funny way to learn. Initially, it was but it quickly gets bogged down in too much superfluous information, too many names, too many dates, too many clever little plays on words. I have about 100 pages to go and I'm struggling to make myself finish it ('cause that's the way I am with books). I can't say I'm not learning anything. I am. But I can't wait until I'm done with it, either."
3,The Idiots guide to the Gnostic Gospels,Well written but the attempt to explain the gospels is overdone. I would have liked to have more to read that was less narative.
4,Good blades,Good blades and was always happy with there performance and recommend to any willing to spend a little extra cash
5,PIAA Wipers,These are a great pair of wipers. I have owned them for three weeks now and these wipers clear water well from my windshield without leaving streaks or the sqreaking sound. I believe they of better quality than Bosch and Rain X which I have both owned before.
3,terrible writing but good advice,"This book is excrutiatingly poorly written, with painfully unfunny sarcasm as well as a misplaced or missing comma in every other sentence. While this distracts from the advice the author gives, the usefullness of it outweighs the obnoxious writing. Anyone who speeds, which is basically everyone, would do well to read this book."
3,Informative yet...Not complete,"This book does a very excellent job of informing you of what to do when a police officer pulls you over. However, it says nothing about what to do if you get the ticket as to how to defend yourself in court. Also if you're a smart person with commmon sense than this book won't teach you very much. May be just teach you a couple facts"
2,"Good, but not great","This is a good book for helping one to avoid tickets. It does tell how to watch for patrol areas, undercover cars, and other techniques to reduce one's risk of getting a ticket. However, it leaves a lot to be desired on how to beat tickets. The author was a former police officer and apparently doesn't want to betray his fellow officers in court. Yet, the book is still useful for most drivers. The chapters on radar and the traveling techniques were useful."
5,Mom & Dad and I are Having A Baby,This is the most excellent tool for sahring and preparing siblings for a birth. There are black & white drawings to begin with and then when the baby is being born the crowning of the head is bluish and then the cord is also blue and then the amoniotic fluid is reddish tinged to help the older siblings understand that this is normal and take some of the fear & shock away ahead of time.
4,"good pocket screwdriver, but a little brittle","This screw driver was nice because the clip wrapped completely around the handle. I was tired of the pocket screwdriver with the clip enbedded in the handle, they tend to come off after a while. My pocket screwdriver snapped in use. I guess I'm a little hard on tools. I switched to an ace pocket screwdriver where the bits store inside the shaft. works great."
5,Pure and beautiful singing,"Joan Baez has one of the most beautiful voices ever recorded. Here she demonstrates the soulful, haunting quality of her range, from the lyrical and lilting ""Farewell Angelina,"" to the subtle sacasm of ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,"" to the strong and stirring ""Hard Rain Going to Fall."" To hear one of the classic folk singers of all time, listen to this album and marvel at a true master of the genre."
5,Classic Vintage Baez,"Though her 1968 release, ANY DAY NOW, was her actual Dylan tribute, this classic Baez album contained four of the best Dylan covers of Joan's career. The title song, a gem filled with surrealistic imagery was never even officially recorded by Dylan (though a bootleg does surface from time to time), and ""A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall"" is given a near definitive treatment by Joan, her version quite possibly surpassing Dylan's. The other material, including Woodie Guthrie's ""Ranger's Command,"" the traditional ""Wild Mountain Thyme"", and a German version of ""Where Have all the Flowers Gone?"" round the album out nicely."
4,joan sings DYLAN well,"Joan's Dylan covers are always great, but I actually bought the album to hear her versions of Pauvre Ruteboeuf and Sagt Mir Wo Die Blumen Sind. I really didn't care for either of them because her pronunciation and accent was off with the French and German, so it came off to me as a bit pretentious. However, Farewell, Angelina is still worth getting for the Dylan covers. I often prefer her versions over the originals."
3,Is this album so good????,"I own virtually all CD's of Thelonious Monk ever issued (from Blue Note, Savoy, Atlantic, Riverside, Columbia) and I have to tell you this: I've never got into this album. It's lousy and boring ... I prefer to listen to him in smaller formats like trio or quartet. From the first listening, I have been long wondering why this album is so preferably rated by people and critics ... Of course, this is NOT BAD, but far from highly recommendable. ""Plays Duke Ellington"" is so much better than this.I know my opinion would be hard to accept, but again I stress that I bought virtually all CD's of Monk (nearly 60-80?) and haven listened to them over and over again."
2,A dissenting view,"There seems to be some consensus that this is a classic, but I am unable to enjoy it. I absolutely love Monk's Dream and was looking for more. In contrast, this collection seems saxaphone-heavy, with Monk most often deep back. Monk's Dream seems carefully crafted whereas here I feel like I'm walking in on a club performance with a lot of one-off improvisation. And the tempo here is soporific, as if everyone's under-the-influence. There is not a lot of material on the recording, but more of the same would not help me. My search for a great second Monk recording continues..."
5,MONK SHINES HERE,THis is a GRAND DISC HERE BY THELONIOUS MONK.THE MUSIC will BLOW Your Mind.His Talent is so Incredible that you can't explain it.Very Rich&Timeless Quality here.VERY ESSENTIAL.FROM THIS GENIUS.
5,Medieval beauty,"Someone gave me this for Christmas. From the first song, I knew it would be great from start to finish (no bad tracks on it). If you like medieval, renaissance, or folk music, this is going to be one of your favorite albums. His voice is poignant and lovely, the instrumentals are perfect, and the songs are beautiful. You will be glad you purchased this, and your friends will ask you, ""What is this album?!"""
2,Wasn't what I expected,"Bought these for a '99 4runner hoping they'd give me some amazing stopping power as I had read on forums and such. I'm not sure if its because I'm coming from a Miata with Falken HP+ but these seem to be pretty normal and give a spongy feel, stopping performance doesn't seem to have increased wit these. Did the change with Dot 4 racing brake fluid and new rotors, going to try HP+ next time I do a change. Wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for better than average braking power but it gets the job done."
4,Well... they do their job.,"For the price, they do a great job. The plastic knee portion is durable and slides well (important when on your knees all day doing floors). The padding is sufficient. The straps... well, they're not the best ever. They tend to loosen a bit, and the elastic is too soft to hold well yet too stiff to be really comfortable.This isn't to say that they're incredibly uncomfortable... not at all. I'm just saying there are others that are more comfortable. The others have a much bigger price tag, though...I picked up 4 pair of 'em on a Friday Sale, for dirt cheap. I use them a LOT, and they do hold up very well."
3,Rough guide disappointment,"My husband and I traveled to Greece in July. We have used the Rough Guide on may other trips, but thought the Greek Island Rough Guide was not very accurate and lacked necessary information. Many hotels were not included and prices were much higher than we were led to believe. There was not enough information about riding the ferry system, which is a huge part of traveling the Greek Isles. There were few restaurants listed. The book is so large and heavy, yet practically useless to us."
1,I felt like being cheated,There is no description on the dimension of this product as well as the strength rating (1000 or 2000 lbs). The picture created a false impression of a much larger product. The actual size is about 3 inches. Bad description !!!!DE-STA-CO 323 Pull Action Latch Clamp with Threaded U-Bolt
2,Bad Idea. Buy any other Rheostatics CD!,"An idea for a clever title for their first album. ""Greatest Hits"" is NOT a collection of their greatest hits. It is easily their worst album, and thats saying something because I LOVE every other Rheos album. The best song on the CD (The Ballad of Wendell Clark) is on their DOUBLE LIVE album. Buy that instead."
3,its a tshirt!,what more can I say - its seems well made and the design is vibrant. Good as far a tshirts go
5,What can I say,"Ok its not a date T'Shirt, or something the woman in your life would want you to have. But this is a guy shirt and sometimes reflects who I am and what I feel. Do I like being offensive??? Yes! Enough said."
3,An Introduction to Fantasy with a Misleading Title,"This is a misnamed ""survey"" compilation of short stories and book excerpts, most of them from the young adult fantasy genre, many of them with no mention of wizards whatsoever. A few excerpts don't even have any overt magic. However, this is not to say that there's nothing worth reading here. There is definitely some classic material here by Roald Dahl, T.H. White, E. Nesbit and many others, but generally only in bite-size chunks - enough to whet the appetite but not satisfy it. If you're looking to sample the work of many children's, fantasy, and children's fantasy authors before diving in on whole books by each, then this anthology serves as a good introduction, especially for complete novices to the genre. But if you're looking to read about wizards specifically, look elsewhere."
2,Not very satisfied,"I was excited to find these earrings on the website, but when i got them they didn't look nothing like on the image here. Everything's different- the stone, the stone's colour, the style of the chain. Really disappointing. And they are much longer than you'd think. Won't be returning because after paying for shipping i'll only have some couple of bucks left. Not worthy"
3,Ok read,"It had a lot of potential, but fell short of the mark. Story was pretty predictable. It did keep my interest, but it's a book that I'll pass on to someone else to read. Good for reading once, but not a keeper."
5,Very Happy,Read this book years ago and it have finally managed to purchase it. Great story from Diana Palmer at her best.
2,A Very Over-Rated Book of DP's!,"I ordered this book online after reading the exceptionally high praises of the 2 earliest reviews, but this one was a huge disappointment for me.... There wasn't much of a storyline in this book(definitely not well developed at all....), & so, much of the book was very repetitive & also, the premise of the book was almost completely unbelievable.... (Don't waste a lot of your money to buy this one like I have.... This really isn't worth it.... I really do belive that some of the reviewers on this site leave vastly over-rated reviews for out-of-print books, just so that they can sell their old books off at vastly inflated prices.... The really good ones by DP R The Diamond Girl & Dr. Coltrain's Proposal!)"
2,MILDLY INTERESTING- BAD WRITING,"If you have seen the movie ""Goodfellas"" and you remember the major characters and events, the first half of this book is mildly interesting. Mr. Hill clears up a few mysteries left behind by the movie story, such as who killed whom, etc. The second half of the book, in which Mr. Hill describes his life after he left the gangster business, is boring as can be. He takes drugs, cheats on his wife, takes drugs, cheats on his wife, takes....on and on and on. He still ends up in jail now and then and spends a lot of time in drug rehab centers.The writing thoughout the entire book is amateurish, repetitive, and poorly edited. You frequently have to mentally fill in words that were apparently left out.If you want a good insider gangster story, this is not it. This is simply someone cashing in on his notoriety."
2,Don't waste your time.,"I'm giving this book two stars, and I think that is being VERY generous. I'm a HUGE fan of the movie 'Goodfellas' but this was terrible.First of all, the writing is horrid. There was no flow whatsoever and Henry Hill kept repeating words. Grammar mistakes were ridiculously obvious (ever heard of having it proofread at least ONCE?) Honestly, I didn't even make it through the whole book, it was that bad. I almost always press myself until the end but this time I decided it wasn't worth it.Henry Hill was obviously just trying to capitalize on his fame. If you want to read a decent book about Henry check out the one written by his kids (Greg and Gina Hill) called 'On the Run' - that one is worth your time."
2,More crap from Henry.,"I wonder if old Henry prays for Marty Scorsese each day? He damn well should. I doubt he would've even survived until today if it wasn't for Nick Pileggi first and Marty Scorsese second. . . thanks to them Henry can today peddle garbage like the ""gangster cookbook"" (!) from a site someone manages for him.Anyway, at least this one's SLIGHTLY better than most of Henry's usual off-topic BS, as it gives some details he omitted while narrating to Pileggi, plus some post-Goodfellas events. Unfortunately, it also -- mostly, in fact -- contains more of Henry's usual rambling, nonsensical comments and pointless reminiscences. And it's so badly written I could actually believe he wrote it himself this time . . . (nah, he just hired a lousy ghostwriter -- oh, Henry, ya cheapskate! Don't be so stingy or your next ghostwriter may ""whack"" you, har har.)"
2,This is unbelievable....,"You've watched the movie classic: Goodfellas. You think the movie's awsome, and this life seems pretty darn cool. Please look into the not so well known book of On The Run, a Mafia Childhood. This book is written by his son and daughter(Not two daughters as seen in the movie, and the book Wiseguy) Gina and Gregg Hill.Read that book, if you truly want to know what Henry Hill is like. Quite honestly he makes me sick. He's trying to squeeze as much money as he can out of this thing without doing any work what so ever. It's a step above his old ways of earning money, but not much.Please read that book not this one, this one's filled with more of Hill's BS."
3,"Gangsters, Goodfellas and a jerk.","In a review of his children's book it was stated that Henry comes off well in this book, Wiseguy and the Movie. Just to let people know I thought he comes across as an arrogant, narcisstic jerk, who cares nothing for other people."
4,"enjoyable, interesting (but a bit thin)","While certainly not a Mob masterpiece, this breezy 262 pager can be consumed in one or two sittings and will entertain those interested in the Godfather/Goodfellas/Sopranos culture. Though Henry Hill's morals may be a bit...uh....limited, he's a good storyteller who has lived a fascinating life, albeit one best viewed from a distance (he describes leaving a trail of ex-wives and business partners in the dust). I like this one quite a bit."
1,Trash,"If you enjoyed the movie Goodfellas and wish to find out more about Henry Hill, I recommend Wise Guy, not this piece of garbage. All the money in the world won't necessarily give you any class at all, and Mr. Hill demonstrates this again and again. As soon as he referred to the pay by the hour adult motel ""Hottubs"" (or Tubs, I can't remember) as a ""real classy joint"" or something along those lines, I knew I could read no more. Yuck. Mr. Hill, you don't deserve a dime, you deserve to be in jail. One day you will pay for the life you have led. And how nice of you to refer to two of your mistresses as the real loves of your lives, I'm sure your kids enjoyed reading that. And give up the name dropping already!Don't read this book."
3,"Good, but not great","From a musical standpoint, there don't seem to be very many original ideas in this soundtrack: If I didn't know any better, I'd swear Glasgow borrowed a lot from David Arnold, Joel Goldsmith, John Williams, and James Horner (among others). I suppose that if you're gonna borrow, you might as well borrow from the best!Still, this is an entertaining score that does a lot to enhance what I felt was an otherwise mediocre film. I do like the choral elements, and the use of some nifty percussion. And yes, I did get goosebumps upon hearing the Ulpio Minucci's original Robotech theme in the opening titles!"
5,Great for the Classroom!,Awesome turn around-this was on my doorstep 2 days after ordering! I highly recommend these activities for supplements to your Shakespeare lessons!
4,Rimbaud and Mallarme finally elucidated,"John Porter Houston strays from the usual in this wonderfully written book. Most other authors deal only with the poets lives and works in a trivial and banal manner, treating the poets as precocious and intoxicated. It is refreshing to finally find a book that reviews their legacies in terms of cultural and philosophical currents in a diverse and lucid manner. Included are reviews of selections of their work with the original french and the authors own intelligent translations. I highly recomend this book to any serious student of either Rimbaud or Mallarme as one of the few available which is both entertaining and thought provoking."
5,Nice bag!,I thought it was going to be bigger. It was a little smaller than expected. I actually like the fact that is a kind of small. It is not big and clunky. I can fit a few things without a problem. It is heavy duty and I have not had a problem with the zippers like other bags.
4,No expectations,"I thought the CD was very good but went into the purchase without any expectations. The title may mislead... the CD isn't ""whoop it up"" wicked. Good purchase all in all."
5,A Fantastic Introduction to TCP/IP,"I thought I knew a lot about how TCP/IP worked internally, but after I got this book, I revised my opinion of myself. This is a fantastic book. Clearly written, with excellent diagrams and explanations. I found myself sitting in a comfortable chair, reading this book from cover to cover, strictly because I was learning so much about TCP/IP, and learning it so fast.I cannot emphasize enough how clear the writing in this book is, and how helpful the diagrams are. If you are a System Administrator or a Network Administrator, this is absolutely required reading. I love this book!"
4,"very good and technical, but not focused on minutia","Many networking books I read (or other books on similarly technical subjects) have a tendency to get bogged down in technical minutia that distracts from the big picture. Not so here. Cormer does an excellent job of getting all the important information out there and explains the common networking protocols, what goes into them, and what they do, without losing the reader. Do not think that this is a superficial view though - I've been in the field for several years now and still use it as a reference on occasion."
5,The most incredible bible on Internetworking!,"Before I had read this book, I thought that I knew all about networks and TCP/IP. This book opened my eyes and brought total clarity to whats going on. It has lots of sweet examples for learning the nits and gritties of networks. Get it and master internetworks!"
5,An essential guide to anyone needing help with TCP/IP,"I was daunted by the prospect of reading a book like this one, but was pleasantly suprised. The author takes the reader through the beginnings of networking, protocols and the Internet in plain, simple English.The TCP/IP protocol is described in wonderful detail and as a reader you can delve as deeply as you want.I was able to read the book from cover to cover. I keep it handy as a reference (especially when I need help with subnetting). It's not the cheapest book in the world, but it should be the only one you need when it comes to this subject.Thank you Mr. Comer."
5,Good book to prepare for the CCIE written exam,"Book covers all the necessary technologies for the Cisco Certified Internetworking Expert written examination. FDDI, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, IGMP, ATM, TELNET and more. Purchase along with the following titles: Internetworking Technologies Handbook from Cisco Press- ISBN: 1578701023 and Gigabit Ethernet ISBN: 0139132864."
4,Excellent Reference,"Comer's book is an excellent comprehensive reference source and one of the few books that travels with me anytime I need to do network troubleshooting. It is an undoubtedly dry read, but indespensable, nonetheless. Suitable for beginning or advanced networking engineers."
2,Richard Steven's TCP/IP Illustrated is MUCH better,"Douglas Comer was first book that I read to understand the TCP/IP about 12 years ago. However, after reading the Richard Stevens' series, I changed all of the training material that I was putting together for the company I work for to use Stevens instead.The Richard Steven's book is much better at explaining the principles and concepts of TCP/IP and if you really want to understand the internals of a good TCP/IP implementation, the Richard Stevens, ""TCP/IP: Vol II"" uses the BSD (Unix) implementation, which is much better than Xinu (Comer's choice).This is a good book, but Richard Stevens' ""TCP/IP Illustrated"" is much better."
3,The only DK book that I passed away,"Not up to DK level. The fake shadows, made to give the feel of 3D, are annoying and pollute the understanding of maps. I swapped toAtlas of the World: Seventeenth Editionfrom Oxford University Press, a little more expensive but much better."
4,wigeon64,We shot 35mm slide film for years. This slide file is a great storage as they are put into the computer.Have 4 files now. Last one had a broken spring in one latch. Latch still locks.
4,Secure Storage for Archived Images,Quality product provides secure storage for slides. Price is somewhat high for what is provided though.
1,Box,"I am very sorry, because I can not give my opinion about this product, because I never receive it, there was some problem in the custom house and was lost."
3,Serves its purpose,"The Logan LG1500 serves the purpose it was designed for ... slide storage. The external metal case is made reasonably well though not perfect since latches do not always line up (to be expected at this price). The internal slide holders were a disappointment. Instead of rigid plastic trays, the trays are made of cheap plastic insert material best described as the same type of plastic trays used to separate candies in a box of chocolates. They will not stand the test of time. All in all, it meets the immediate need; however, it is a disappointing solution for the price. Probably would have been better served by the cheaper achival quality slide archive boxes found in such places as Adorama."
2,Flimsy,"I expected a metal box to have some strength, but I think if these were dropped they would be bent out of shape. The inserts that hold the slides are worse, the thinnest possible vacuum formed plastic, like something to be used once for a shipping package, not archival storage."
2,Not very impressed.,"We use this book in my Linear Algebra class, and i really dont like it. The book is pretty terse, and doesnt explain things very clearly. Text needs to be re-read several times to understand the concepts. If you can get a more detailed book on the subject with clearer explanations."
2,Engagingly written but outdated,The book was published in the 60s and that shows. So much new has been discovered about ancient India since then that the book is hopelessly outdated. I would recommend to Romila Thapar that she should revise it.
1,Needs to be revised,"This book was written almost 40 years ago, since when archaeologists and historians have made great advances in the understanding of ancient India. It is written engagingly, but it needs a revision badly. In its current form it misleads as much as it illuminates. Ms Thapar, please update your book!"
1,"A Marxist, biased view","Romila Thapar's writings on India present a sanitized, revisionist view of the encounter between India and Islam. She interposes her Marxist ideology too strongly into her narrative which makes it hard for the reader to trust her judgments. She is unable to define an `Indian' view of Indian history."
1,A Marxist view of early India,"Communism is dead but it lives on in Indian universities. Romila Thapar is the foremost Marxist scholar of ancient Indian history. This book is, therefore, full of the prejudices that mark that ideology."
1,Outdated History Book,"After advent of ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said, the playing field is even. This Book by Romila Thapar is an Outdated Marxist Rhetoric/"
1,This is a joke-book!,"Avoid it; anyone who buys this book is financing a anti-India, socialist looby.Author is well-known for her twisted take on anything Indian."
5,Marketing Explained in about 2 hrs.,"This is what most business books should be. Brief, to the point, no wild theories, just good old common sense.This book is broken up into the ten questions a new CEO, from finance, gets to ask the marketing genie. It explains the basics from segmentation, product strategy, advertising, distribution, price etc. Most of the information is pretty basic, but as explained in the book it is just what most people don't do.P.S. If you have read some of Jack Trout's previous books, you will notice some overlap in the concepts explained here. However, it is still worth the short time it will take to read this book."
4,It is what it is!,This is exactly what the seller said it was! And I got the item lighting fast!I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys collecting charms.
5,BUSTAGUT FUNNY---NO BULLSTUFF!,"This is Joe Bob's ""life"" story and general commentary on life in Grapevine, TX, and America as a whole. If you know who he is you know there's a lot of intelligence underneath the hayseed facade. Mr. Briggs is a great figure of pop culture and that ain't no bullstuff!"
4,Maranatha Music,"If you never heard this music when it first came out done by the Maranatha Singers, you wouldn't know it wasn't the best there could be. The original music that we did in church was much richer and just seemed to have ""something"" that this album lacks. I'll use it though because I haven't been able to find the originals."
3,New music?,I had expected all the original recordings of these songs and was disappointed at the medleys and shortened or jazzed up numbers.
3,Good for the price,"This watch was just as I expected, with a nice, thin ivory strap that goes with everything. The one problem is that it needed a new battery after only a month...$10 more and a pain in the neck. But for the price, overall it is a good buy."
2,Bad Luck?,This is my second indiglo watch. The date on the first watch did not roll over correctly. On the second watch the indiglo worked well for the 1st month and then it stopped working.
2,looks nice but ...,"I bought this watch as a gift for my wife. It looks great but within a few weeks of using it it started running slow. Now it has simply stopped working. It could be a simple-battery change is needed but, still, our experience so far has been disappointing."
4,classic Mary Black,"this CD is so good but, of course, somewhat depressing when listened to at length...great CD to turn someone on to Mary Black for the 1st time"
5,Stunning,"The reviews are absolutely right on here, Mary Black is just stunning on this album, she got the balance right. Lea Boys Lassie is an amazingly wonderful song, listen to it over and over."
5,Beautiful,"Mary's melodies are at times light-hearted and whimsical (By the Time it Gets Dark), at times haunting (Leaving the Land). All are lovely."
3,Good audio cd,"I bought it because of the one song that I wanted, ""Blanket"". The rest of the tracks are good, not great. But it is pleasant to listen to."
2,One hit wonders,"I read the reviews above and bought the album. I had heard Blanket and thought it was a great track. Unfortunately, the rest of the album was sophomoric dribble. Read some of the lyrics before you buy the album and you will get a good picture of what the rest of the album is like. The lyrics are worn out or just silly, and the music in every other track reflects this. Urban Species never again manages to capture the austere haunting flow of Blanket, and you should not encourage them to try to do so."
2,"too much detail, too many characters","Lots of detail. Sometimes way too much detail. And although the characters manage to somewhat resolve themselves into individuals (at least some of the men do), the way in which they're introduced made them very hard to distinguish one from the other for the better part of the book."
5,Converted,"I was showing my friend how to rip cd's, and ended up with this double disc on my computer. I had never really listend to DMB all that much, but do appreciate good accoustic music. After hearing this set, it is EASILY in my top 10 list of all time best albums. I get blown away every time I listen to it, and it only served to enhance my appreciation of DMB.I mostly listen to punk like minor threat/anti-flag, guitar rock like seaweed and the white stripes, and more experimental stuff from bands like fugazi and sonic youth. This live album added one more genre to my daily rotation. It makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck, just as high as 12XU or stepping stone by minor threat. This blows my mind over and over again.An absolute must have, even if you think you don't like DMB, or have never listened to them before. Guaranteed to please even the pickiest ears."
5,Amazing,"I first came across DMB when i heard the song ""Stay"". After that i bought ""Before these crowded streets"" and i thought. How cool wouldn't this be if it all was unplugged. As an answer to my prayers this CD was released. On this record DM's songs are more like your'e usual american singer/songwriter than on the albums. And DM's voice is fantastic. He sings which such emotion and such honesty that this record is well worth having just for the sake of his vocal performance."
5,Incredible reditions of Dave's best tunes.,This acoustic CD is a must buy for any Dave Matthews fans or anyone who likes great music. The reviews I have read are mostly bad for this CD. I don't know what CD they were listening too. Tim Reynolds is amazing on the guitar.
5,"Dave Matthews Band has yet to disappoint me, I love them","Dave Matthews band has the most original, unlike-any-other music. Those of us that love their music appreciate it, and in some way or another can relate to it. No mattter the mood, Dave Matthews is always fitting and the best to listen to. Their c.d.'s are great party tunes, but also the absolute greatest to listen to by yourself. There isn't a song yet that I don't love, let alone an album. Keep the hits coming, I can't wait to hear every one of them!"
5,BREATHTAKING!!!,"All I can really say is I don't normally like live albums at all, but this one is outstanding. I absolutely love this album! Dave and Tim have great chemistry together. I love the song ""Little Thing"". What a great song! It's like a little story turned into an amazing song. I could never get tired of this album. I think it's their best live album."
4,Little Thing,"This song - Little Thing - will turn in to another great song in the next album, you'll see.... I was in DMB's Free Jazz in Rio de Janeiro last october and I would like to know if you share my toughts: Isn't ""Tripping Billies"" always the best live song ?? It always sounds incredible, no matter when or where, plugged or unplugged !!!! Best Wishes"
5,Accoustic pleasure from beginning to end......,"Maybe I'm a little biased (going to Luther College), but this is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. The slow, relaxed accoustic version of ""What would you say"" is close to perfect. ""A Cristmas song"" is so emotional that I almost drove off the road while listening to it. Wonderful from beginning to end."
5,"Dave Matthews follows up ""Red Rocks"" with another hit","This is exactly what every DMB fan wants - variation in the way Dave Matthews plays each time you get a chance to hear him. Every song is just a little different that what you've heard before (live or on previous releases) and it makes it unbelievable for the listener. A must buy for any DMB fan. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later."
4,Good,"I recieved the product around the time it was said to be delivered and I was in good condition. I love listening to this CD, so this was not a wasted purchase at all."
5,"I just finished listening, and I'm breathless","Well, I just bought this album today, brought it home, and listened to it all the way through. What can I say, D&T are amazing. I cant say that I was an original DMB fan, but I dont think it matters. I have come to know, love, and appreciate the talent and feeling that goes into the music. Live at LC is just another snow capped peak in a long range of majestic mountains, hand formed by Dave and Co. If you appreciate the brilliance of DMB like I do, I dont need to tell you to by this album, you are more than likely already on your way"
4,Nothing new but full of love.,"If you're a fan of Dave Matthews Band (and I'm not talking about everyone that waits for them to play ""Crash"" and ""Satellite""), then you should have this album. It presents many of their songs in a lighter arrangement without as much presence but an increased clarity of melody. You can hear more of what Dave does on the guitar and more of the vocals (which he spices up a bit). The best part, however, is the addition of Tim Reynolds. He's put some wonderful bits to the boys' studio albums and it's nice to hear him rip it up onstage. The unreleased songs are unworthy of release (even the Reynolds'-worked-up, guitar jam) on their own but feel natural in this live set that is intimate, to say the least. People unfamiliar with Dave Matthews would be better off starting with another collection as this one doesn't present the songs at their best or fullest; it just puts a new spin on the favourites fans have grown to love."
3,Not bad,"This album is pretty damn good--almost all of the songs sound great stripped down (exception: What Would You Say). And the selection of songs is superb--these are definitely most of the best Dave Matthews songs. But Tim Reynolds kind of ruins it for me--he plays much faster than the songs require. Sure, he's an amazing guitarist, but this album is pretty mellow in general, and it just doesn't fit. However, it still has some standout tracks like Trippin Billies and Seek Up. Worth checking out."
5,A Masterful Collection from the world's greatest band,"Without a doubt a magical collection that can't be missed. Dave lovers know the treasures that these live disks produce, and non-Dave lovers must experience this to truly form an opinion on the Dave Matthews Band. The best band in the world produces an exceptional cd, all tracks are listen worthy, no skipping needed. A masterful collection full of emotion, wisdom, and life's lessons. If you have any interest in music you will have this in your collection. The music is of superb quality, matched by no other, and the lyrics are o so true. Each track gets better the next time you hear it. Never getting old, Dave Matthews Band is truly the best band in the world, and this disk just may be their best. Trust me, don't pass this up-you will never forgive yourself."
5,Awesome Cd!,Im a very big fan of The Dave Matthews Band and this cd is still one of the best cd's I own today besides Listener supported and Live at the Red Rocks.
5,Excellence,"One word to describe this live album would be excellence. Everything about it is great. All of these song's are dmb classics and this is a classic show. It's not the best show of dave and tim's but it certainly was a good one. Some of the highlight's are Halloween, Ants Marching, One Sweet World, and Typical Situation."
5,You will never forgive yourself if you don't get this album,"Absolutely extraordinary. Dave Matthews has given us one of the best live performances in recent memory. Anyone who has been to a DMB performance will definitely agree. One of the few artists who actually sounds BETTER live than on a recording, this truly is a joy to behold. From the meaningful One Sweet World to the comical Ants Marching, this an album that deserves more than 5 stars. I'm not sure if you can wear a CD out like you can a cassette, but this is definitely a disc that should get worn out from all the airplay it should get. Put your player on continuous play and enjoy it over and over again. Even if DMB never makes another album this will be one to treasure forever. Cheers to DMB for bringing so much lyrical joy to this ""one sweet world"" and here's hoping for much more!"
5,I wish there were more stars,This album is incredible. Dave Matthews is doing what every artist is having trouble with...he found a base of fans and then he managed to keep them and create new ones. It's obvious to discern why when listening to this album. He masterfully mixes all types of music to create a music genre of his own. He magically mixes the power of his words with the melodic tremelo of his music. A combination that will never be matched - that will last for some time.
4,Wonderful acoustic set,"I like this album much more than several of Dave's studio recordings, because it lacks that annoying over-engineered quality that so many of his studio sets take on. It's fresh and altogether like the early days."
4,A must for every fan or soon to be fan,"Let's face it. When it comes to music in general, a good live album is hard to find. ""Live at Luther College,"" is one of the few exceptions.Buying this album on a whim without really looking at it, I was pleasently surprised to find out that this CD was Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds live, and that's it. No Band. Believe me, I love the band, but hearing Dave's popular songs done on two acoustic guitars added a new element that I loved from track one.I've been a Dave Matthew's fan since I first heard him, but I never appriciated his talent until this album. There are many excellent musicians in bands, but until you can solo them out of their band you'll never truely realize how amazing they are.In the end, this CD is a must. Even if you have every DMB CD put out, this one's a must. If not for it's uniqueness, then for Tim Reynolds. That guy is amazing! I swear he has seven fingers on each hand."
4,Clown for breakfast,"Although I agree with most reviews and think this album is very good musically speaking, It seams that Dave had ""CLOWN FOR BREAKFAST"" before the auditionI think he should stick to been a musician and refrain from been a comedian his jokes make the album kind of obnoxious.He loses a star."
1,Bland bland bland,"I find that daves got about two rifs in his bag of tricks.Saw him live in ottawa*( ive never seen the energy sucked out fo a room so quick.)About two songs in and your asking your self ""isnt this the same song he just played ""Another example of how quickly over exposure can kill a talent.Mabey its just the state of rock today, what use to be fifteen minutes of fame is now one."
5,Definitly A Must For DMB Fans,"This CD is quite addictive, being a genious collaboration from MR Dave and MR Tim. The sounds are incredible, the acoustics make you want to pick up a guitar and play along, and the lyrics we all know already all combine to make an excellent CD. This is a definite worthwhile CD to buy, and will remind you of what a true musical gem Dave Matthews has become."
5,I WAS THERE......what a night....what a CD!!!,"As one that sat in the audience when Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds played at Luther College in 1996, you can imagine my shear joy that the two would release this show as the first official release of the pair playing live. Its really an excellent recording which is owed mostly to the fine on stage meshing of the two performers and partly to the wonderful acoustics of Luther College's Center for Faith and Life Building (I myself have had the pleasure to play mainstage there also). The acoustic versions of Dave Matthews presented on this CD are simply fantastic and offer a different perspective than can be heard from hearing Dave with his band. Do yourself a favor and pick this CD up!!!!"
5,AMAZING LIVE CONCERT IN AMERICAS HEARTLAND,"AWESOME LIVE RECORDING,DAVE MATTHEWS REALLY WAS OUTSTANDING IN ALL AVENUES OF THIS LIVE VENTURE.THE INTERESTING SIDELIGHT OF THIS WHOLE CONCERT WAS THE SETTING...A SMALL LUTHERAN COLLEGE IN NORTHEASTERN IOWA,WITHIN A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY ,DECORAH IOWA,,JUST ADDED TO THE WHOLE EXTRAVAGANZA.."
4,Dave Matthews at his most palatable,"After having sampled Matthews' studio work and finding it mostly glorified easy listening, I was skeptical upon being dragged to his concert with Tom Reynolds by a bunch of my friends. Much to my surprise, the duo uncorked a show of amazing energy, depth, and--most remarkably--deep menace. I bought this album in the wake of that show, and it is in this format, stripped of all superfluous adorments of his jam-obsessed band, that I find him most appealing: His voice is a magnificent vehicle and his elastic vibrations recall Tim Buckley and ""Astral Weeks""-era Van Morrison. This album lacks the truly frightening version of ""Don't Drink the Water"" that he put together for his show last winter, but includes ominous takes on ""Deed is Done"" and ""Minarets,"" as well as delicate readings of ""Ants Marching,"" ""Granny,"" ""Tripping Billies"" and ""Lover Lay Down."" I still can't bring myself to listen to his studio albums with any regularity, but I enjoy this one quite a bit."
4,Dave Matthews Unplugged-Finally!,"Of all the Dave Matthews albums I've listened to. Of all of his concerts I've been to ( with his band of course), Nothing compares to the sweet sound of him playing accoustic guitar in front of an intimate setting. If you want a mellow sounding album to listen to, Dave's live album with partner, Tim Reynolds, at Luther College, is IT!! All of guys may or may not agree with me on this. If you have had a crappy day and you don't want to bang your head to Limp Bizkit or Metallica. Put on ""Live at Luther College"", and let the music of Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds relieve you of all the pressures of the day. TRUST ME!!"
5,"The best acoustic CD since Clapton's, bar none!","If you even remotely enjoy this type of off-beat takes of popular songs, order this CD immediately. Don't even think it about. I can listen to it over again and again and again..."
1,Same old Stuff,When I bought Crash by Dave Mathews I was quite impressed but his is not the music I like to listen to over and over. I'm getting tired of his voice and the same songs on several albums. C'mon Dave come up with some new good stuff. Your last studio album laid an egg. Time to step up and produce.
1,SELLOUT,"now that he's popular, we have all the college-aged kids trying to find their identity in his music. welcome to the bandwagon."
1,All I have to say is HA HA HA!!!!,"What a waste of money, this is nothing new! I mean, it could have at least been the whole band! DMB fans everywhere, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH!!!!!"
5,i wish you could give 6 stars,"this cd is just unbelievable along with all the rest of his cds. if you do not like any of the rest of the stuff he has done i would not say this is the cd for you, but you still could not deny that it is a shame this cd is not #1."
5,Dave and Tim succeed again!!,"I saw Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds in Utica, NY on Jan. 27, 1999. I loved the show,and am still reeling from the performance. This live CD proves that Dave and Tim are musical geniuses. I love it!!!"
5,"Dave Matthews/Tim Reynolds, what else needs to be said?","Dave and Tim come out with the best version of ""One Sweet World"" with an awesome solo that fits in so perfectly. After that, they go into one of my favorties, ""#41"". Dave plays ""What Would You Say"" slow and it is honestly amazing. The whole cd is awesome, with a wide variety of music. ""halloween"", ""Granny"" and also one of my all time favorites, ""minarets"" are some songs they play during the show. Must not forget the all time classics though: ""Christmas Song"" and ""Seek up"". Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds are truly the best! this cd is a must for anyone who likes Dave."
5,A beautiful harmony of emotion and incredible talent!,"This has got to be my favorite cd ever. I have never been such a devoted Dave Mathews band fan. I am constantly carrying this cd from in my house to my car and back again because i can't stop listening to it. It made my 8 hour drive through Texas feel like I was sitting at one of his concerts. I almost wanted to keep driving (almost). If you like Dave Matthews, even just a tiny bit, you have to get this cd. Tim and him are amazing!"
5,Live At Luther College definetely just for the fans!,"Live at Luther College is, of course, atypical of Dave Matthews. Now, I've seen Tim Reynolds with his band, and he's a strange coke-snorting man, but a talented one. Reynolds' incredible guitar riffs and smooth transitions (""Stream"" and ""Jimi Thing"" especially) rock! Dave's relaxed sound on these two CD's, compared with his studio recordings, are wonderful. For example, the contrast between the studio recorded versions of ""#41"", ""Crash into Me"" and ""Say Goodbye"" and the versions on these CDs is incredible. Dave plays with words, changes rhythms and basically rocks the house down. I wish I went to Luther College!"
5,"If you're a fan of the person, then...","this is the album for you! I, for one, love both the music and Dave, himself. With this album, not only do you know every song by heart, but you, somewhat, get to know Dave as a person. I love the conversational manner in which this concert is performed. Whenever I play this album, it's like I'm in some small, quaint pub listening to someone who lets you into the music. Although it always has been, you get a greater feel of the emotion and depth from which these songs came. And, you can't help feel that this concert was meant for you, kind of like a ""Thank You"" from them to us.And, if you enjoy DMB like all of my friends and I do, then this album feels right at home."
5,"Would be my ""Desert Island Choice"".....","Since buying this CD, I can't bring myself to listen to anything else. The quitar playing is phenomonal and what can I say about Dave but that he is a poet and storyteller for our times. I love him! Favorite songs: The laid-back version of ""What Would You Say"", ""Minarets"", ""Granny"", and my all-time favorite ""Say Goodbye""."
5,This is one phatty-assed album!,"It was my first Dave album, and within about 10 minutes it turned into one of my favorite cds. I was a little scared that the absence of drums and horns would leave something to be desired. However, not to say that Dave doesn't need them, but him and Tim Reynolds completely make up for anything that might seem to be missing. I've already ordered three more of DMB's albums just because of Live at Luther College, and he can expect to see me at Meadows Music Theatre(Hartford) in August!"
5,Pleasing to the ear and soul.,"As I have read in the other reviews, obviously all Dave fanatics as myself, it is a treat to hear Dave and Tim in the purity of the magic that they have created on this CD. Even though I have 5 different versions of most of the songs on this CD, every version is different and therefore a treat in itself.Dave can do no wrong in my mind, and the way his music makes me feel is beyond description"
5,An Awesome Collection of Dave's Greatests,"First, everyone that says it is repetitve and annoying, know that it is a live cd and was performed in concert that way, and if any of you have gone to at least one of DMB's concerts you would know how amazing the band is.Especially with the more than amazing Tim Reynolds. Each time I see or hear the band or Tim play with them, i get blown away by pure talent. If Dave isn't your sort of thing, don't listen to it. But for other true Dave Fans just listen and enjoy."
4,"Skip the concert, get this instead","I was one of the lucky fans that was able to see the Dave/Tim duo in '97 during their first, limited tour. Althought the music was fantastic, Dave's interaction with the crowd left a lot to be desired. My overwhelming impression of Dave was-- who is this meathead? He was rude to the crowd on several occations, and not once did he strike me as the gentle, sensitive lyracist of his songs.If this album is as good as the MUSIC in his live show, I say save your money for a concert ticket and buy this instead. On his best behavior, he is tolerable. In the unrecorded show I attended, he was an ***"
5,This CD is a must have for any fan of music.,"Dave pulls out all the stops in this one. I've never heard Dave and Tim together, and now that I have, I feel deprived because it took so long. If you have to, scrounge together 16 bucks in pennies, DO IT! because this album will not leave your CD player probably until his next new album hits the shelves. I know it hasn't left mine! ""Granny"" is awesome! I can't wait to hear it in a studio recording because with all the rest of DMB it can only sound better. The quality of his music just keeps getting better and better. As my advice to all of you, ""buy anything and everything this guy puts out, you cannot beat the best, you might as well just enjoy it while it's around!"""
5,Just what I needed to repair glass,I needed to repair a cake stand. It kept coming apart with other glues. I read up online and found this UV glue. I do not have a UV light so I set it out in the sunlight and bingo! we are all set.
5,Loved the Book everyone should read it Young and old.,I read it in grade 8 for a independent study project. I loved it and gave it to my friends to read. They loved it as well.
5,I thought my sister and I were alone,"My mother recommended this book to me over twenty five years ago. I found it in the library and fell in love. My sister picked it up and we started reading it simultaneously, stealing it back and forth from each other. Many years later I went in search of a copy only to find that the library had sold it off. I bought a copy through a bookseller in the back of the NY Times. Six months later I was Christmas shopping in a store that had a lot of old books as decorating props. One was a copy of Mrs. Mike. The store manager gave it to me when I explained its emotional value. My sister now has her own copy and we don't have to steal from each other any more. When I recommended it to a friend and she said she found it on Amazon, I was thrilled and just had to see what everyone said. I'm so glad this remarkable story is available to women today. It is truly and inspirational tale that will stay with you all your life."
5,Wish I discovered this book earlier,"Yes! I have read a few books that I wanted to read again. However, ""Mrs. Mike"" by Benedict and Nancy Freedman found me wanting to re-read chapters the first time through.This treasure will be stored in a special place to be read again and again when I want to go back in time, feel feelings and thank God for talented authors.I wish I had found it as a teenager, or a young mother. Guess this retiree should just be grateful that I was given this warm gift in my latter years."
2,kinda slow,A friend recommeded this book but it is starting out slow and losing my interest. I may go back to it and see if I can get into it.
5,The Best Book I've read so far.,"...My mom read this book when she was about my age and loved it, so when she found it again she got me to read it. I loved the story of Kathy and Mike. I couldn't put the book down. I would recomend this book to anyone. It's great."
5,A book for all ages,"This is about the only book I have ever read more than once! I read it the first time when I was about 13 years old. It was filled with beauty and romance and a healthy dose of real life. I read it a second time just after high school. I enjoyed it even more because Katherine was starting her like just as I was. I read it a third time at about 30. I could relate to the mother and wife that Katherine became. I often suggest the book to readers, young and old. I get something new out of it each time I read it. It is beautifully written and you find yourself traveling and living along with Katherine and Mike."
1,Highly over-rated!!,"Maybe I missed something...but I think this book is highly over-rated and simplistic. There is no depth to the plot; the 'white' characters' dialogue is stilted and sometimes silly--""Oh Mike, do you really think so?"" whereas the Cree conversations are reduced to language resembling that of Tonto. Tragedies abound, and Kathy, the protagonist makes astounding rebounds, time and again, with a wide-eyed, little girl enthusiasm which grates, after about page 18. I don't get the rave reviews and testimonials which seem to span some readers' lifetimes. This is really thin reading fare and so unrealistic; if you're looking for historical fiction, this ain't it. If romance is the genre, I'd say fair enough...but there is certainly better stuff out there. As far as calling this a 'true story' or memoir...I'm highly skeptical."
3,Quick Read,"Interesting Enough Book. Although I felt that too much ""action"" was packed in the book, you did not get to really know the characters that well as they were just jumping from one adventure/tragedy to the next..."
5,A story of love and growth,"I first read this book when I was a very young girl, shortly after my father died. I loved the book because it was ""real"" and was still a beautiful love story. I found my personal escape in the story of Mrs. Mike. During my adult travels, I lost my original book. I didn't think I would be able to find it. At age 41, I am married to my own ""Mike"" and thrilled to be Mrs. Mike. I am so glad that this book is a lasting story for all time."
5,A wonderful book for adolescence up to old age!,"Like most other reviewers, I first read this book as a 13-year-old, 30 years ago. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love with Sgt. Mike Flannigan. Many years later, I was lucky enough to receive a first edition copy from my husband's family and it remains a treasure in my personal library. This book made a lifetime impression on me as a young girl to love and respect nature and native folklore, as well as to find a mate who is also my best friend! Highly recommended!"
4,Love in the Wilderness,"Like most fans of this book, I first read it as a teenager. I instantly fell in love with the characters. This is a love story set in the Canadian wilderness. Life is hard, but love is strong. This is a touching and memorable book.Highly recommended for entertainment reading. And buy an extra copy for your daughter or grandaughter."
5,"Forty Years Ago, A Rare Book with An Independent Heroine","I am enjoying reading that so many women of my generation (I'm40) were so affected by this wonderful book. And no wonder... it isromance, adventure, light comedy, and good social history all together. A great book, and one I'm trying to figure out how I'll get my 12 year old son to read."
5,Unsurpassed!,"I rue the day I gave this book away after I finished it. I rarely read a book again, but I would make an exception for this one. It's especially good to read it if the snow is blowing outside."
5,"Heartwarming, touching love story that takes place in the harsh Canadian wilderness","This book was recommended on Amazon after I searched for books similar to Bridges of Madison County, which is one of my favorites. Mrs. Mike started a little slow but ended up being a beautiful book that I really didn't want to end. It was based upon a true story of a young girl that was sent to live with her uncle in the Canadian wilderness due to her pleurisy. She fell in love with a ""mounty"", which is similar to a police officer, doctor, etc responsible for hundreds of square miles in the middle of the wilderness. It was not only a love story but it was about the harshness of the Canadian wilderness and what people went through living there before even the railroads came through. Diseases, tragedies, bear attacks, etc. Very very sad in some chapters. I would rank with one of the best books I've ever read - touching, heart warming, heart wrenching - all at the same time."
5,I loved it!,"This is a very engaging historical romance. Set in the early 1900s, it is the story of young Boston woman who marries a Canadian Mounty and settles with him in the Northern Canadian wilderness. I was captivated by how much they grew to love the lifestyle, despite wildfires, plagues and harsh wilderness conditions. This story can be enjoyed by young and old alike."
1,not as good as everyone says,"I was really disappointed with the shock value moments in the book. I actually stopped reading after Mary Katherine goes into Sarah's Shack to get some homeade remedy for her second baby. I found this part of the story harshly disturbing, and I wished I had never read it.I would not give this book to a young girl, read the end of Chapter 17 and then decide about it."
2,oops,The item was sent very quickly. I was very happy about the service from this company. That particular item did not hold thick books very well. I will do business with this company again.
1,Shipping almost the same as the price?,I really did not buy this item becausse they want $6.49 to ship this item that cost $6.49. Customer should really look more carefully about the shipping cost before they buy anything.
4,A thinking man's thriller.,"Forget Tom Clancy and turn to Tom Whissen. Whoever he is he seems to know what he's talking about in this absorbing novel of backstabbing in high places,not to mention disloyalty and institutionalized hypocrisy. And in the persons of Otto Beck and Peter Engel he has caught the nuances of the thoroughly corrupted chamer and his gullible prey. Read it between the lines for an uncanny look at mid-20th century mores."
4,Great B-Sides...,"The two B-sides: Running and Spirit remind a little me of his ""the End Of Everything"" album, because it's simple electronic music. For me ""Running"" is a very happy song. I love it. Worth buying if you are Moby fan."
5,I am SO happy I bought this book for my daughter,"I saw this on the shelf at the store and read the back cover. I thought it would appeal to my 15 year old daughter who is going through a ""stage."" I gave it to her and she gave me back a dirty look. Then, that night, I heard laughter from her bedroom and I could tell her TV wasn't on. I went in and asked her what was so funny. She was giggling and pointing at the book.She gave it to me the next day. It was the first time I ever saw her read a book in one sitting. I started to read it and I finished it last night with a big smile on my face.There are lessons learned in this book, ones I've taught my daughter and ones that most kids and adults alike should learn. But they are not heavy handed. Instead, Ms. Nash is so clever in her writing that I was caught up in the story (which is a rarity for kids books as any parent will tell you). And it is just plain funny. I just wonder how Ms. Nash met my daughter because she sure got it right."
4,With Great Power Comes A Lot of Headaches!,"Vickie Marotti is no jock or beauty queen, so the only place she's going to fit in is with the other misfits.This gives her the idea to become the ultimate misfit - a curse slinging witch! - to protect her fellow outcast friends. Using really cool stage tricks, Vickie seems to make her curses come true, but as long as no one knows the truth and no one gets hurt, why should Vickie care who she scares with a little drama?The problem is that Vick seems a little eager to throw her fake curses around. Is power going to Vickie's head?Throw in some mean-spirited classmates worthy of being cursed, a goat with bowel problems, a cute classmate who wants to be more than friends, and a friend acts like she's a new enemy, and Vickie is having one heck of a school year!""You Are So Cursed"" shows you how the tricks are done but never lets the magic escape. This is one teen magician I hope *doesn't* pull a dissapearing act!"
3,Interesting.,"Vickie Marotti is a smart, sassy teen witch, or at least she'd like everyone to think she is. From pentacle's dangling from her ears to curses rained down upon the heads of all enemies, she appears to have the whole black magic thing down pat. When Gio enters her life though, the jig's up; he's a real magician, and Vickie is just Vickie. The only magic is the tingle between the two of them. All the curses and such have been a scam, Vickie's shield to keep all who would come near far enough away to not hurt her. Now that she wants to let the shield down for Gio, how does she do it without letting go of too much of herself?*** While there's no witchcraft, if you spell witch differently, there's a few of those around. Vickie shows readers that much of the time when you see a scary looking kid, it's all an act, and there's a really neat person hiding under the mask. There's a few comical gags and sarcastic wit to lighten the otherwise serious message. ***Amanda Killgore"
3,THIS IS A SOLUTION MANUAL,I just want to point out that the description in the page only applies to the HARDCOVER textbook and this is a solution manual to the main text and not a paperback version of the actual text so nobody makes the same mistake as I and confuses the two.
1,Please correct name of book to STUDY GUIDE,"Please! Change the label of this item to show that the [paperback] link takes you to the student's study guide, NOT to the paper back version of the book."
2,Dense; Not for Self Study.,"VCR directions. Especially how it explains variation of parameters (2.3). If you are a math whiz, this text is for you. If not, try to get a copy of Dr. Kapoor's _Differential Equations: Step by Step E-Z Math Cards_. By the way, Zill's Solutions Manuel simply omits explanations for many odd-numbered problems, so good luck."
2,diffcult text for the DE student,"The written derivations and examples were brief and difficult to understand. I gave up on using this book for learning DE,only use to practice problems required for assignment. After finding alternative study links, did the DE aspects become clearer. Solution manual did not bring much to the table either."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"This was by far the worst Study guide I have ever used. It only gives some clues to the answers. Even if that is not too bad, it wastes pages on explaining how to solve the equations on mathematica (which is a waste is your teacher doesn't require mathematica) instead of actually further explaining ANY of the material.Seriously, words cannot describe how MUCH I hate this book. Note to the author: If you didn't feel like giving us answers to the problems, then don't kill trees in selling this worthless book."
1,worthless,"In calc I and II i relied on the solutions manual to help get through homework, which were very helpful. This book, however, does nothing of the sort. It only shows answers to randomly-numbered problems (i.e. #3,6,9,12,15,16,20) some problems just show the answer without any work toward the solution.Absolutely worthless"
2,Classic Old Text,"This is a book from the old school of ODE's. The absolute focus of this book is analytical methods and beats the algebra and integration drum to the exclusion of anything else. If you want to learn how ODE's were solved 25 years ago then this book is for you. If you are looking for a book that deals with more modern theory, or handles modeling in a constructive manner then this book is NOT a good choice."
2,An excellent paperweight,"I am a graduate student in mathematics so I've been through my share of textbooks. To this day, I have not found one quite as inconsistent as this one. Some sections are flawless; the author is elegant in his explanation, the examples are clear and relevant, and the problems serve their purpose. However, the poorly written sections (and trust me, there are plenty of them) far outweigh what little beauty lies in this textbook. Anyone who wishes to meticulously plow through this book will know what I'm talking about. The most depressing thing about it all is that I can't seem to find a book (on DE's) that's any better! So to you mathematicians out there: write a decent book on Differential Equations; you might become a millionaire. However, as mentioned earlier, this book will weigh down anything, even in the strong winds of Lubbock."
1,Wheres the Solutions?,I bought this book to show me how they got the answers to some of the problems in the text book. I was very dissappointed when I recieved it to find that all it did was basically give only some answers and a few clues as to how they got them. Does not help you at all.
1,Waste of Money,"This book's example problems are impossible to follow. They skip way to many steps, making learning from the text near-impossible. If using text, pay attention to prof. in class, as you won't learn anything from book, except confusion."
1,Waste of Money and Time,This is the worst Math book I have ever been forced to use. It skips way to many steps when working out example problems. The student is left in an extreme state of confusion. You would be better off burning your money than purchasing this book.
5,Sweet story and beautiful wood block illustrations,"My daughter has loved this book since she was 3 and continues to love it at 5 years old, having memorized it and ""read"" it to her preschool classmates. Katy is a sweet big sister to Tiny, helping him overcome fears and leading the way for fun adventures. The illustrations are beautfiful and serene."
2,Mediocre,"I purchased this cd partly because I like E.Y. Harburg, and partly because I was interested in hearing how Vincent Price would handle himself in a musical.After listening to it, I can't say as I was disappointed, but I also can't say that I'll be listening to it a lot. The song lyrics by Mr. Harburg are not memorable overall, and Mr. Price is not a particularly engaging performer."
4,Accessible and thought-provoking,N.T. Wright writes readable commentary that dwells on faith issues as wellas textual enlightenment and historical context. You don't have to be a seminaryprofessor to read this and find it helpful!
5,adorable,"absolutely adorable!!! Not a toy to be played with, but completes my daughter's collection of the Beatrix Potter's characters!"
5,"superfluous, smarmy, and inept","GROVE'S DICTIONARY OF JAZZ is thorough, authoritative, and eminently readable: there is no reason for this ""encyclopedia of jazz"" to exist. Yet exist it does, and it is hardly an encyclopedia of jazz. It has biographical and record-title entries only. Its information is sketchy and inaccurate. Its prose is glib, clumsy, and amateurish. Its diction is indiscriminately inconsistent. Prefer the GROVE'S DICTIONARY OF JAZZ.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,Works great but be careful.,"This was a great product and works very well. Only problem withit is that the o-ring in the shutoff valve was very weak and tore through, now it leaks brake fluid when there is pressure in the tank. Be careful to not over tighten the valve when closin it do not open it up all the way, you should be fine. If other people use the brake flush tool make sure they know or you will be in the same situation. I will be sure to have plenty of these o-rings for future use now."
3,Not as good as I had hoped...,"I expected more out of this book, I have enjoyed the series in the past, although the daughter Caron is irritating! I really thought the story dragged quite a bit in this book, and must agree with others that our main character did some really dumb things."
2,There was a story here?,"I have always liked this writer, especially the Claire series. She has such wit, and the stories are usually good too. This book was a real let down, the story ( was there one ?) was weak at best. So many words, so little to be said, could have been a 25 page book. Sad."
4,Still the best account of law school.,"Even though this memoir was first published almost 25 years ago, it is still the best depiction of what law school is *really* like. When I went to Harvard Law School (starting in 1995, exactly 20 years after Turow), everyone told me ""It's not like One-L anymore."" That's only half true -- One-L is overly dramatic, but the basic events and emotions he depicts rang true again and again. Of course, as the other reviews show, some law students are able to blow off the intensity, others (like Turow) become consumed by it, and the rest (like me) swing back and forth between panic and enjoyment. All in all, this is an excellent peek at the law school experience. Just don't use this as your only basis for deciding whether to go to law school and/or to Harvard."
4,One L is an entertaining read,"With a friend of my son scheduled to enter Harvard as a 1L this fall, I couldn't help but jump on this book after we discussed it over beers one evening.Despite the fact that the author's experiences took place years ago, the book was entertaining and you really felt yourself pulling for him and his fellow students. I enjoyed the book and found it a quick, entertaining read."
4,Good story about the first year at Harvard Law School,"This book gave a layman a real feel of the rigors of the first year in law school. I think the story could have been shorter, but it was a very interesting read."
5,fascinating,"I have read most of Scott Turow's books. This one is different, but extremely captivating. Reading of his life as a first year law student will be entertaining to anyone who contemplates law school or simply wonders what law students go through to obtain their degree."
4,"Dated, but insightful","Turow offers great insight into the tribulation of first year law school that only a survivor can convey. If you are a reader simply curious to read about the stress of Harvard law school then I highly recommend this book. However, if you are a reader looking for a solid reference to the first year law school experience then you will probably find this book a little dissapointing. Turow tells a great story and emphasizes the high and lows of law school, but law school has changed a lot since the antiquated 70's and the commanding tone of Harvard Law does not necessarily resonate among all law schools. It's a good read overall but lacks applicability."
3,This book seemed to be taken straight from the paper chase.,"A good, entertaining book. Mr. Turrow, for most of the book is just boasting of how wonderful it is to be at Hahvahd.... His book bored me half to death. If you want a book dealing with how to prepare for the study of law, get ""How to succeed in Law School."" This book is by Barrons. It is available from Amazon.com.....The author is Gary Munneke..."
4,well written but not true,"As a security guard at the Harvard law school I was amazed at some of the stories told in the book one L. Most of the students I asked about this book either said it was untrue or didn't happen now. So I decided to write my own book about what the Harvard law school is really like called ""1L-Yeah Right!"". I couldn't get my book published so I gave it away on disk. I thought about getting my book published through amazon, but blew that off too. If you are interested in my work e-mail me"
3,"Interesting, but ......","The book is a fascinating look at life for a 1st year student at what is, arguably, the best law school in the United States. And, the look is interesting and eye-opening.The but part is that it drags and gets repetative. It was about 1/2 way through when I started thinking...all right, let's get to the end of the year.It's a book worth reading, but don't expect it to keep you glued to your seat."
2,not that accurate,"I think that anybody who is about to enter law school should not read this book. It will only scare you. I am completing my first year of law school, and my first year was nothing like this. The students were not that competitive, I did not study every waking moment (in fact I worked while going to law school), getting called on in class was not the emotional nightmare portrayed in this book, law review was not all anyone could talk about. The reading was interesting at points, but read it with a grain of salt. Law school is not like it was portrayed in One L, unless you make it that way."
3,Turow's warped view of law school,"Before I tear into Turow, I have to admit that a lot of his perceptions of first year laaw school are close to the mark. He also captures well some of the hysteria that goes on during the first year. That said, you can't take his personal reactions to the law school too seriously. After my first year I realized that Turow was a little weasel and a geek--most people don't act the way he does in school.So take this book with more than a grain of salt, but don't let it freak you out."
4,bringer of nightmares,"I am about to go to law school, and I read this book to get an idea about what I'm in for. It gave me nightmares. Wonderfully written, and you really feel the horror and psychosis that the author went through. Therefore, I would only recommend this book to people who are not irrevocably committed to going to law school, as I did not need to have my worst fears realized!"
1,Not Like Law School Today,"For anyone considering law school, don't worry about this book. Before I went to law school, I heard from numerous people that I needed to read this book (and watch The Paper Chase--which, as other reviewers have pointed out, has many similarities).I don't think either gives a very accurate portrayal of law school today though. Yes, there is a lot of work to do; yes, some--perhaps many--people still use study groups; yes, there are ""gunners""--the people who inevitably feel the need to talk in every class and want to outdo the professor. But there's a lot of fun too, and I don't think the stress level ever reaches some of the extremes portrayed in this book.My law school (not Harvard, but still in the top 20) had kegs in the courtyard every Friday (similar events on campus or at bars are referred to as Bar Review at many schools), and people found a lot of time to blow off steam and otherwise have fun.Read this book if you're interested, but don't stress about it."
3,One L,Nicely written book. At times it was hard to believe how pathetic the characters were. At the end the story tailed off but on the whole worth reading.
3,"Another ""Paper Chase""",This autobiographical recount of year one at Harvard Law School is overly dramatic. Either the author was naive upon entering HLS or he was so in awed of this trade school that he allowed it to dominate his life and ruined his marriage. This book makes me want to go through Yale all over again
3,"Gripping, then it turns painful","I really liked the first half of the book. Mr. Turrow successfully pulls us into his story; his emotions the relationships he has with his wife and the friends he makes are all very clear and exciting. After he took his first term tests, it was like running the middle 10 miles of a marathon to finish up the rest (although i have never ran a marathon, im sure the middle is very tedious, but it had to be done if you want to finish, gnome sayin). It was mildly excited to learn of his first term grades because the reader wants to know how he did. After that we dont really see much of the emotion (and im sure there wasnt a lot of emotion going on, considering he was probably exhausted most of the time) but still, we could have cut down some of it. Well, Im just glad to be done with it so i can move on. Im glad i read it though."
3,The TRUTH about Harvard Law,"For anyone considering attending Harvard Law School, or any other law school for that matter, do not let Turow's 1L intimidate you. I'm currently a 1L at Harvard Law, and Turow's account of life here is not completely accurate. Most people I've met are not like the jerks he knew, nor is the quality of life anywhere close to how he portrays it. The consensus among 1L's here is that times have changed, and more importantly, that Turow was a paranoid wimp while in law school. The opportunities and advantages of attending Harvard far outweigh the little inconvenieces that Turow encountered, like not seeing his wife for a couple of hours. If you've seen The Paper Chase, lump it together with 1L and cast them aside, for Harvard is not the monster it's portrayed to be."
2,Outdated and melodramatic,"As fiction, Turow's book is a decent read. As a portrait of Harvard Law School today, it's a dud. I haven't experienced a moment of the backstabbing competition Turow claims to have found everywhere 30 years ago. I have never heard anyone discussing his or her grades. The class is not ranked. Study aids are freely shared. Turow was simply going to a different law school than the one that exists now.Bear in mind that Turow arrived at HLS with a contract to write this book. Drama, conflict, and agony are necessary ingredients of any good expose, and he provides them in abundance. My happy One-L year would have made the world's most boring book.Read it for your own entertainment. It isn't bad literature. But don't let it scare you away from law school, or from Harvard."
5,Great book for both students and spouses.,One L is a classic story that has stood the test of time. I am currently a 1L and have found that this book is fairly accurate. The personalities he portrays are still very alive today. I would encourage anyone who themselves is heading to law school to read this book. In addition I would recommend it to the significant others of future law school students.
4,If you are interested in law school...,"If you have gone to law school or want to go to law school this book is really fascinating. I plan on going to law school once I'm done with college, but if I wasn't, I cannot imagine reading this book just for the fun of it. This guy is no John Grisham but he does manage to write an thoroughly entertaining book out of what I previously thought would be a dry subject. But I was wrong and I was fascinated by the classes and studying habits of Mr. Turow. Once I picked it up, I did not set it down until I was finished reading it. I have no regrets in buying this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in the happenings of law school."
4,a peek into a self-contained world,"This is a great read, and I would recommend it to anyone, but especially the spouses of law students. Just like it happens in other areas of academia, these graduate students have to block out the larger world in order to focus and succeed in their own sphere. It's fascinating to watch the political struggles that go on over various issues and professors. This is among Scott Turow's best work, as his fiction beyond ""The Burden of Proof"" really deteriorated."
2,Law school in excruciating detail,"While Turow is a skilled writer, he appears to be a less skilled editor. This book expounded upon every last conceivable detail of the first year of law school, and, in my view, would have benefitted from more brevity and less exhaustive detail. I read this book after having completed my second year of law school, and found it to be a slow and painful recap of every moment of my first year. It is accurate, but to one who has experienced it, it contains no fresh insight on the experience. Good for those contemplating law school, ho-hum for those who have already gone."
3,"Good story, but no real guidance","I read One L and enjoyed Turow's story. I do think the sharing of his daily life and emotions as a first year law student is beneficial. However, I have also read The Law School Breakthrough by Chris Yianilos. Yianilos gives a very detailed description of the tools and techniques needed in order to not only survive the first year, but to excel in your class. While I did like reading One L, I feel like the Law School Breakthrough is the book to get if you're looking for concrete guidance for law school success."
3,Writing my own version,"I have enjoyed It. But, I'll be writing my own version from the perspective of a first-generation law student attending an average school in the new millenium. One-L is somewhat outdated because many technological advances have changed the nature of the classroom and ways of communicating with fellow law students."
4,"a good read, not a guidebook","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I feel like it gave me a rough idea of what to expect as a 1L, but I won't know for sure until I actually become one myself. For now, I would recommend it to anyone interested in going to law school but isn't really sure what your education will entail (as was my situation when I initially read the book). Since it was written so long ago and the author was pretty much commissioned to write it, I wouldn't take it as a true-to-life guide to being a 1L nowadays, although I'm sure a lot of experiences transcend schools and generations."
3,"entertaining, but of little practical use","This is a decent read, and lots of law schools have their students read it before they get to law school. But without some book that gives direct advice as to how to succeed in law school, the messages of this book will be of little use. Instead of spending time on the silly, philosophical books law schools tell students to read, get the practical books. They will do your soul the most long-term good."
4,"Personal and ""connected to the dark"".","This book of poetry has a strong imagery and narrative, telling the stories of Pittsburgh and its depths. However, don't let Pittsburgh be misleading to the true themes: memory and darkness. The poems are honest, with a precise and not-too-wordy language that would block their strength. An example in ""Home"" from ""A Connection to the Dark."" ""And in a voice hard as her fingers/ says 'Your dinner's in the oven/ getting cold.' Home is where/ Such scenes seemed to linger,/ Where you lost the first fears/ Of dying or being orphaned."" I recommend this book to people who are starting to explore Contemporary American poetry, or people who are in the kingdom. I've read this book three times and from it at Open-Mic nights; it didn't win the National Poetry Series award for nothing (as the catch phrase goes). Its strengths go beyond their words and are as elusive as night."
1,99% worthless.,"Hi,I received my copy a couple of hours ago, what a disapointment. What you see is not what you get. I was expecting to see some insight into military based hand to hand combat training (see front cover and the back cover is even more impressive).What you get is two guys and a gal in sweatpants and tee shirts in a gym in kiwi-ville repeating about five basic defensive moves that are deemed to solve all your close combat needs, what a joke."
1,Disappointing,"I would not recommend this to anyone, the other one star pretty much sums it up. I now know not to purchase any more Todd Group material..."
5,"Nice value, won't go stale any time soon","I buy a lot of our candy at amazon through subscribe and save because in the long run it is cheaper. I rarely get a request to buy candy at the gas station because I can point out that there is already candy at home. I am careful about what candy I buy in bulk, because some candy you can't keep very long (chocolate for example) without it getting melted or stale. These Pixy Stix are perfect for our candy stash. Don't get me wrong, we do have fruits and veggies in the house too! You can't go wrong with Pixy Stix, most kids love them. As someone said earlier, they are great for stocking stuffers too."
5,Perfect for a Peter Pan Party!,"My son wanted a Peter Pan birthday party. Unfortunately, they don't make Peter Pan party supplies anymore so I searched and searched for supplies, including items for gift bags. These were perfect! I printed a label with Tinkerbell and put a quote about pixie dust on it and they were the hit of the party. As for the actual candy, it was fresh, the bags were surprisingly large, and it met all my expectations."
3,Not bad - some are better,"Bought this before trying others. I like another better. Don't get me wrong, this syrup is fine; I just like another better."
2,rather slow and boring,"I found the movie to be rather slow and boring. The possession of the girl wasn't horrifying or even creepy. Infact, I must say I preferred her new hair style to the old. I didn't find her visions of ghosts creepy but rather cheesey; that is if she was really seeing them. From the back of the movie box it is stated is she really being possessed or is she just insane...so I guess it depends on which way you want to view the movie."
2,Not bad but not good,"Don't waste a Netlfix spot for this one. If you catch SyFy or Chiller on a slow Saturday, give it a shot. The acting, for the most part, is more than decent, especially the two leads (Jen Taylor and Carter Roy) but the film is really, really brought down by the terrible music. The real star of the film is the gorgeous home that's the primary set. Just beautiful. The movie isn't complete turkey, though. More like squab sized."
1,Avoid This Book Like The Plague,"Do not buy this or any other book written by Ira Distenfield or his bird-brain wife. Ira Distenfield is a con man, a thief, and a liar who has made a very comfortable living by using sham corporations to protect his assets from creditors, cheating the IRS, breaking laws pertaining to unauthorized practice of law, and engaging in other fraudulent activity. This is written by a man who brings American companies to their knees by lying to them in sales agreements, writing fake promissory notes, and selling fictitious franchises. Do a few google searches yourself if you don't believe me. NOBODY should be spending a dime to support this con man, his wife, and their crooked lifestyle. The only place Ira Distenfield belongs is in a federal prison."
1,Don't Be Sold By Made in USA,"I have an earlier version of this compressor. It was an I-R, so I was confident I was getting a good machine. It broke down 4 months later.I called I-R and ordered the replacement part. They don't service just the pump. You have to buy a new pump and guess what? It's $400!Don't go waving the flag over this. Look at what Toyota did with the Tacoma issue. They offered all owners fair market value for their broken trucks - even though they were out of warranty. With I-R you just get a big repair bill."
5,SEXY,"ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THIS IS A SEXY , SEXY SHOE. HAVENT WORN IT ANY PLACE YET BUT, I VE TRIED IT ON NUMEROUS TIMES."
5,"Got an ""old"" book, in good shape, and fast.","Shipping cost more than the book and it was ten times more expensive as a ""new"" book. Just what I needed for my project!/Mac"
2,Really not that good.,"I was expecting quite a lot from this book, because it has been recommended so many people and organizations. However this was a disappointment. I feel TDD is important topic and way to go, but this book is not the one I would recommend to anyone. It's kind of reference book, but quite poor one."
5,Should you buy it? Yes!,This book does a remarkable job of covering the philosophy behind good unit tests and frequent automated builds. The author is very forward thinking in the ideas presented.If you want to get up to speed quickly then buy this book.
3,Stops where it gets interesting,"I like the way Kent Beck writes his books. And it's sometimes thrilling to read his strange ideas. Having seen so many projects skip unit testing completely the idea of writing tests first strikes me as very good. Mr Beck presents his ideas very clearly and leads the reader through all subtleties and traps of a small example. That's exactly the point where things become interesting for me: How does the academic idea scale when being faced with Web apps, EJBs, XML/XSLT and so on? Hardly any hints about that which makes me wondering if the approach can be used for real projects."
4,A good starting point,"A good starting point for TDD. Kent starts with a fairly simple example, that is useful to start learning the red/green/refactor paradigm. I would put more accuracy to the pattern chapter."
2,"Over-complicated, far from practical, IMHO!","After readingContinuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk, i picked up this book and was expecting a book with TDD advocate material (and/or recipes, anecdotes, do's and dont-do's etc.) but was sadly disappointed by the content. The books is probably written for better minds where mine fell short by a long distance.No, i do not want to learn Groovy (or whatever language it was) while i write a test case tool to test drive my tests and have to think about bootstrapping my test cases. Sorry, this is too much for my little brain when a nice set of scenarios depicting usage of TDD would have been much easier to follow (and appreciate).Maybe i will read it in few years again (when i have collected enough intellect to grasp such content) and give it a better rating, for now it is a two star."
3,"intriguing ideas, irritatingly presented","The book's scope is well-defined and its methodology (including a running ""task list"" that is updated at the end of each chapter with strikeouts and new items) is innovative. But it falls sadly short in execution.The text is overloaded with cutesy digressions that only serve to obscure the topic at hand and irritate the reader. No ""Head First"" title, this. To read this book is to wish over and over that its author had had the humility to submit it to another editor's series rather than launching it under his own.Still, there is no other book quite like it on this subject, and I can certainly recommend it for extended bookstore browsing. You may find you are less sensitive than me to Beck's assaults on clarity, in which case by all means go forth and buy."
2,A Book About Arithmetic,"OK, I understand the need for a simple example to demonstrate the concept, but how much to I have to read about adding, multiplying, and checking equality of dollars and francs before getting to the real meat? Besides, the last time I checked, most compilers were pretty good at floating point arithmetic. It's not as if that's where I spend most of my coding time.After reading about 30 pages of introductory material I was getting desperate for some real-life examples, especially involving databases. I searched the table of contents, but all the chapters have cute names that give little or no indication of the contents. I checked the index for terms like ""database"", ""entity"", ""record"", ""query"" - zero, nada, zilch. But hey, I did learn that it's more important to have an expensive chair than an expensive desk!I'm sure I can take what I learned in this book and extrapolate it to real-world application development. But if I have to do all the heavy lifting, why do I need a book?"
3,One of those ugly and overpriced necessities.,"Try the Forum for your vehicle before plopping down the money for a new component like this. This is the OEM replacement for a number of cars. Naturally, a couple weeks after I bought this to correct the related trouble code, I received a MAF and misc. parts from a Forum member and there, in the bottom of my $75 grab bag, was another perfectly good vapor canister purge solenoid. This new one is less overpriced than a number of alternatives."
2,Doesn't quite fit,"The wire connector was smaller than on my 1985 Ford Country Squire and the tubing fitting was larger. I cross-referenced to Autozone {Wells} brand and they showed a different part number, but the picture showed the same small wire connector and I could not tell from the picture about the tubing size. I used the part and replaced the wire connectors and adapted the tubing size. Something I learned from electrical work--electricity always uses the path of least resistance. It was easier to make it work, then to try and find a part that may not be available."
2,Slice of Life,"Don't be mislead by the title, there is mo pornography here--unless you consider murder pornographic. The plot, if there is one, seems wandering without a clear goal. Why this film won awards is beyond me."
3,Teen Fare,"It is not as the name suggests except as inferred. Not a very good movie, but teens may like it."
3,Tracklisting,"""This album has been entirely recorded and mixed live and direct, to save the spontaneity of the concert."" - back cover of CD1. Sans Titre No. 12. Sans Titre No. 93. Sans Titre No. 34. Sans Titre No. 45. Waref6. Sans Titre No. 8"
4,Wounded Heart,"What a great book for those who really want to understand what is going on inside the mind, body and soul in regards to childhood sexual abuse. Very helpful in the healing process."
5,A Blessing...,"This book was recommended to me by several people. I had always struggled with whether my experience as a child was really abuse or not. This book has been so helpful sorting through my experiences and their effects on me. I have been going through the workbook in counseling and highly recomend that as well. The workbook really makes you process the information and helps you retain what you have learned in the book. The most influential moment of this book for me was the message that the whole reason that we go on this journey of healing is to ultimately love better. It is not to blame, justify, or sulk and get stuck. Some books you just know God puts in your path...this has been one of those!"
2,Religious,"From page 1, this book has a religious slant. I don't have anything against that but I didn't see anywherein the description or reviews about how heavily this book refers to God and ""your"" relationship with Him.I was not looking for that slant and find myself skipping over all the parts that refer to religion in any way (whichis much of the book)Just wasn't expecting it, wasn't looking for it, and don't like it."
2,"Insights, but horrifying message in the book jacket text.","I found this book very helpful and well intentioned, but the implication in the book jacket text was downright appalling: why would I think someone couldn't be abused because they were Christian? Being a particular religion doesn't exempt one from abuse, nor does abuse make you less likely to be faithful to God."
1,Offensive!,"I bought this book hoping to heal enough to be in a sexual relationship without being defensive and afraid. Instead, I ended up seriously offended.The author, who is not just a Christian (as I am) but completely fanatical, suggests that the only thing worse than rape is the lack of a close relationship with God. EXCUSE ME? For someone who claims to have personal experience in these matters, he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.I also found the book to be more preachy (stuffed with Bible verses) than helpful. I know the Bible verses, and I know God can provide healing, but Allender doesn't connect the two with helpful advice for actual healing. SUCK."
5,Great,"This is a great book for the wounded heart. If you have been sexually abused, or know someone who has been sexually abused then this is a must read book. Dr. Dan has the reader go into a spiritual journey into the heart and helps him/her go onto the pathway to healing. I'm a pastor and I would recommend this book to anyone who knows (or if you have been an abuse victim), to help them (or you) understand what has happened to their family, friend, or loved one; to know that the incident was not your fault, no matter what happened. Coming from my spouse who is a victim, sometimes it's hard to know what to say or understand what has happened, but this book has been a welcomed tool with the necessary focus, on Christ, to move forward in life and to break the chains of bondage, depression, anxiety, and shame."
4,The Wounded Heart,"this book has a very religious base, as suggesting that abuse can be fixed by embracing prayer to God/Jesus. However the basis for the reaction people have to abuse and the actions of the abuser struck the chord of reality for me. It explains the reactions of the abused and helps to understand how the abused lives in society. Very eye opening explanation of the way an abused child lives their adult lives."
5,wonderful book,It was a good book to read and help me work through a very hard time in my life. recommend to anyone who has gone through abuse in any way.
4,Healthy Food Recipes,This book arrived so quickly. I was amazed. This is a used book and in very good condition. The recipes are very good and easily adapted to Australian food. A good buy for anyone interested in finding more healhy food recipes.
2,Disappointing,"How could someone with so much insight let politics ruin his music by being so close minded? Black Rain? Excuse me, were there not a lot of other folks there besides blacks? Jesus should've surfed? Boy, that would've really shown he was The Son. Come on Ben, open your mind!"
2,Uninspired,"I'm a huge fan but this is easily Ben's worst album. I can't even get through a lot of songs without skipping to the next.Somewhere between The Will to Live and this album, Harper slowly lost the ability to infuse soul or feeling into his songs. To be honest this album is just plain dull. It was apparent that he invested a lot of emotion into his first three albums (Welcome to this Cruel World, Fight for Your Mind and The Will to Live). Since then he's been on cruise control.If you decide to buy this album, don't bother with this special edition. There are a couple decent songs on the third CD, but it's not worth the extra $12."
4,hmmm what to say,"Ok I really liked this album musically. But I did have a problem with it that kept me from giving it 5 stars. I think Ben got way too political , and to me that was a turn off...I prefer my musicians just make good music ...dont try and be a political activist .. no matter what side of the argument you are on. Leave the politics to politicians , and the music to musicians. I know some people will knock me for saying that, citing the history of protest songs and political activism in music....well.....it tuned me off as much back then as it does today. Thats just a personal preference that has nothing to do with the music, whis was overall very good."
2,Short-Sheeting the Fans,Some box set !! Two Cds each hovering around 30 min.and a 23 min. bonus CD. Not bad music but no bang forthe buck when you consider the timings of Ben's other offerings.
1,Not that great,"To tell the truth, the only song i ever really liked by ben harper was ""Faded"" which is on a differant album. The album design is awesome, but the songs need a little more energy. Sure, i liked some of them, but overall, its not something i would want to listen to more than once. If you are a young person, like me, and desires music with a BANG, to it, don't buy this album."
2,Disappointing,"I made the mistake of buying the album before listening to any songs, since I've never been let down by a Ben Harper CD. Well, there's a first for everything.The first song on each CD is really good, but it's downhill from there. Most of it was uninspired with trite lyrics (""It won't be long 'til the people flood the streets to take you down. One and all a black rain is gonna fall"" Did Louis Farrakhan write that song?).It kind of sounds like this should have been one album of about 10-12 songs but was padded out to two. I would rate the first disc a 3 and the second a 1.It kind of puts a damper on going to see his show this year."
5,"Love, Love, Love This CD!","I was delighted to see that Amazon.com named Both Sides of the Gun one of the top CDs of 2006. I'm not going to write that Ben Harper is the most talented musician today: I'm sure he doesn't want to hear that. As an artist myself, I tend to believe that my BEST work is yet to come. He IS brilliant, though. Brilliant in the sense that no matter what kind of music he turns his attention to, he gives his very best. And, yes, he's a poet at heart. His lyrics are beautiful. His music touches the soul. And that voice...heavenly. That's not hyperbole. When I say he's an artist to watch, and he will only get better as he ages, I mean it. This CD is simply wonderful. Happily Everafter In Your Eyes (Couldn't leave you to go to heaven)...is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a long time. But every song here is noteworthy. Keep doing your thing, Ben Harper. You continue to inspire me."
2,Uninspired,"I'm a huge fan but this is easily Ben's worst album. I can't even get through a lot of songs without skipping to the next. Some of the songs have momments of greatness, but are then ruined by trite lyrics or ripoff riffs.Between The Will to Live and this album, Harper slowly lost the ability to infuse soul or feeling into his songs. To be honest this album is just plain dull. It was apparent that he invested a lot of emotion into his first three albums (Welcome to this Cruel World, Fight for Your Mind and The Will to Live), but since then he's been on cruise control."
1,Just ain't what it used to be.....,"Long time BHIC fan, and was really looking forward to this one. I thought ""DOTI"" fell short, but had a few decent offerings. My fave Ben albums are ""Welcome to the Cruel World"" and ""Live from Mars"". I've seen him live nearly 10x. I just don't feel these discs (I bought the 3 cd edition) have the soul to them that seem to permeate his earlier works. There's not a ""One Road to Freedom"" or ""Roses from my Friends"" to be had here, sadly. :("
3,"First is Great, Second Mediocre","Enjoyed Ben Harper's music for more than 10 years, always try to catch him live - love his unique style of music. Quite frankly, his studio albums have NEVER done him justice, which I suppose is much better than the other way around. Very disappointed with Diamonds album, with exception of Amen Omen. This album, however, is really good (1st/2nd/3rd listen so far). Not a Fight for Your Mind caliber effort, but great all in the same. Unfortunately, Harper is raising the bar on my expectations for Pearl Jam's album in May. After being thoroughly disappointed from many of my favorite band's latest releases, Harper continues to deliver quality. Really enjoy the lack of production gloss on this album as well!!! Thank god."
5,Ben's Back,"After hearing this album, I'm pleased to say that Ben is back. His last couple of albums had really disappointed me and I caught myself going all the way back to Welcome to the Cruel World. Songs like ""Morning Yearning"" and ""Crying Won't Help You Now"" really sold this album to me.I'm more of a fan of the mellow and low-key side of ben, compared to his Live at the Appollo type albums, but even I caught myself singing along to songs like ""Please Don't Talk About Murder While I'm Eating"" and ""Better Way.""Excellent cd and I highly recommend it to any true Ben Harper fan."
1,A bleak future indeed...,"While you're at it, be sure to check out The Postman (starring Kevin Costner's butt) on DVD as it is the only other product as tacky as Futureworld available for purchase on this website :p"
1,P - U,I thought I destroyed all of those jambox tapes we made of my high school band practicing. They have surfaced as Trans Am.This album is h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. Don't quit your day job guys.
3,Disappointing,"Why did they have to go and add vocals? I think they had a pretty good thing going up till this point and then someone bought a microphone. Over and above the vocals it's the usual mix of agressive, guitar based playing mixed with post-rock infused electronic noodling. Perfect for fans of Slint, Mogwai, etc...If you can stomach the vocals I think you'll enjoy this one. They haven't lost it musicaly. And by the way, if you ever get a chance to see them live, don't pass it up. Intense."
4,"This is pretty good, and it is some rock.","I like the way this album rocks. It's different from a lot of the rock I like, like Deep Purple, but it's still really good. They cover a song by Karaoke Hustler (""Am Rhein"", whose original title as recorded by Karaoke Hustler I don't think I'm allowed to print), who are the best band that ever lived. Phil from Trans Am recorded them one.... Anyway, these robots rock."
2,Come on Guys!,"After the astounding ""Surrender the Night"" I thought that Trans Am was on the way to becoming one of my favorite bands. Boy was I wrong. They immediately dispose of their rich, complex instrumental songs and replace them with a stupid robot voice who sings such vapid lyrics as ""in my future car/ we will drive far"". While still a great band to see live - this album should be ignored. I listened to it once and never listened to it again."
4,... and then there's Trans Am,"Somewhat of a cult phenomenon, Trans Am has built up a loyal following over the last ten years. Considered by some to be a posterchild for ""post rock"", that simple two world title does not even come close to describing the unique sound Trans Am has created.A bend of electronica, minimalist punk rock, and lavish late 70's art rock, Trans Am creates a sound that defies casual description. Wavering between atonal noise rock and fist pumping arena rock, Trans Am seems to thrive on challenging, pummeling, and fooling the audience.The title track begins with the sampled sound of a DC Metro train, that seemlessly segways into a drum and keyboard dance beat. This is then followed by vocals fed through a vocoder, making the lead singer sound like a robot.If that description grabs your attention, then buy this album. You wont be disappointed."
4,Nostalgic,"Great movie - just watched it again, so decided to buy the soundtrack. Fond, sweet memories. Nice to listen to. It would appeal to us Baby boomers, I think."
1,Beware of Used Items,"I ordered the cd ""Manhattan"" from the film of woody Allen. There were no new ones available and so you sent me a ""hardly Used"" one. Unfortunately, the tape has obviously been played MUCH too often as all the notes are SLURRED, especially the ""Rhapsody in Blue"" side, and is IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy. I will never order a USED one again! I was happy with the dvd ""sleepless in Seatle"", as it was new."
5,A lovely and romantic album!,"The movie is great, and so is this CD. Each song is distinctly different, which adds to the charm of the album. My favorite song would have to be ""Stardust"" by Nat King Cole because it is just so smooth and touching. This album is perfect to listen to on those days when you just want to relax and day dream. A must have for any CD collection."
5,Great Soft Music Selection,"The selection in this CD is great for relaxing at home or listening at work, especially when you need to concentrate on the task at hand and need a ""zoning"" background music."
5,The Best Soundtrack,"Of the many soundtracks I own (& they go back to LPs)- Sleepless in Seattle is the one most often played in my house - It's delightful, it's fun, it's wonderful - it's good to play when alone, when family is working about the house, and when company comes to call ..... it's wonderful."
5,Just as promised and quick delivery.,"This CD arrived just as described, and in plenty of time for Christmas. I'll gladly use this seller again."
4,Contemplate!,"My wife Patt at 83 is enjoying this recording emensely. Particularly ""A Wink and a Smile"" Harry Caonnick, Jr"
1,This movie gives science fiction a bad name,"Save your time and skip this movie. This would make a great MST3K flick. The movie was filled with bad science, misquoted Darwinism, and bad props. Why oh why would the electric cars of the near future have catalytic converters on them? All that separate the ""time zones"" are low concrete barriers and one guard station. The folks from the poorer time zones should be able to overrun it easily."
1,Great story told all wrong.,"A pretty neat concept, BUTThe action was very scarce and there was no chemistry between the two main actors. There was no emotional connection to any of the characters. A back story involving the main character's father never panned out. The dialogue was flat.If the movie was titled ""running"" it would have made sense, since all the characters do is run."
2,Great theme - but poorly executed,"I watched this based on some raving reviews I'd heard.I was disappointed.Really powerful theme that time is currency. It brings extra meaning to the old chestnut of ""live each day like its your last!""And that's how we meet Justin Timberlake's character: Will Salas. He literally lives as each day is his last as he ""earns"" 24 hours of time from his daily efforts in his job. As an aside, Timberlake does a really good job in this movie and is definitely one of its key positives.But other than Timberlake there aren't too may other positives. The movie moves quickly which is good but lacks real integrity. When it is so easy to rob someone of time (just lock your arm in theirs) it should have been far grittier and frightening rather than the overly ordered, almost robotic depiction of the future shown here.Not one I'd recommend nor watch again."
3,In Time,The movie was ok but not one that I would want to watch again. The best parts were in the previews
4,In Time,I enjoyed this movie. It was an old basic plot good guy saves the girl from a family of bad guys but the acting was good and it held my interest.
4,It was OK,"This was no Shakespeare of the movie world, has been a couple of weeks since we saw this movie and I can hardly recall the plot or the acting, neither stood out, but it past a few hours and wasn't that bad we had to turn it off, this is a good rent when you can't decide what you want to watch but isn't a Harry Potter, Avatar, or movie I would choose as first choice, added to that Justin Timberlake isn't the greatest of actors, worth renting!"
1,Not a good movie,"The subject was interesting, but it was not played out well. The movie was rushed, the acting shotty, and many things did not make sense."
4,Worthy Purchase,"The concept of time is relative...we ""spend"" it in various ways... The movie has an interesting take on the subject. We work for time and spend it on loved ones and things we need. Although our financial means give us access to improved medical treatment, and subsequently longevity, our lives do come to an expected end, even with unlimited financial means. The movie is good, though."
3,in time,"well justin timberlake is trying his hand at being an action star. while the concept of the film is different his acting was stiff in the movie. it had good cgi and the plot was middle of the road. the ending was one that was less than to be desired. but, it amazon had it for .99 cents so you couldn't beat it."
3,Ok,Not much of a movie with a lot of wasted talent. I love Cillian Murphy and Justin Timberlake but the story was lacking.
4,"""IN TIME"" with Justin Timberlake","""IN TIME"" with Justin Timberlake: A very interesting concept for a movie. Starts out a little slow but soon makes up for it. Well worth the time spent watching. If you like movie's that are a little off the wall and make it a point for the underdog to come out on top, you will enjoy this movie. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of just how good of and Actor Justin Timberlake might be but I have to admit I was very suprised as too how talented this young man can be.In Time"
3,"Great premise, questionable execution","It's a very interested premise, but the story shifted too frequently between distant locations which made the story line difficult to follow."
4,Surprisingly Good,"""In Time"" is one of those movies that I thought about seeing once it came to the rental world. It was better than I expected. Timberlake was actually a convincing actor in this one. I don't know that I would buy this movie, but it is definitely worth renting."
3,Good,Good movie as I knew but the disc wasn't connected to the tabs in the inside so it has some scratches on it.
4,Exciting Science Fiction!,I'm beginning to like Justin Timberlake as an actor. This story is a good fit for him. I enjoy new creativity and ideas and all of the 'what ifs' we can explore about our humanity.
1,Wow,"Am I the only one that actually saw the movie?Not only is the actor quality INSANELY low - but the storyline is flawed in every way you can imagine.The idea isn't bad, to be honest, but it's pathetic what they made out of it.If you've got enough money to spend, you should probably chuck it out of the window - saves your time being boredwith an astonishingly bad movie.I guess it's true, that they can make crap out of gold."
1,In Time I will die and then I will be free from the memory of this travesty...,"Seriously, the worst actor ever, can hollywood also get over this hyper lame liberal political talking points for an entire movie...shame...had potential..."
4,OK.....,I thought it was a great movie....with the right actors....this movie is a great example of a original idea done correctly...the messages the movie gave were out of this world....cool movie..
4,Great little time filler,"I enjoyed In Time, it was an entertaining movie. At times the phasing is terrible and the movie feel a bit cluttered, it sort of make the story needlessly complicated which just leaves the movie feel rushed, but all in all this is a good movie. Now In Time will never be a cult classic, but if you like science fiction, and especially dystopian future stories then this flick might be worth checking out."
3,Interesting concept.,"The movie kept my attention, and has a neat look on future currency. However, its plot takes a weird turn towards the end. Maybe save it for discount bin."
4,"Interesting premise. Well paced, action movie.","Saw trailer for this in movie theater before it played in theaters and did look interesting but never got to big screen to see it. And, ""interesting"" it was. Premise is interesting and well thought out as it pertains to movie, characters and action. Not sure what to call main character. Hero? Robin Hood? Partly my problem on how to describe main male character is that the ""villians"" are not very strong characters. I dislike them for different reasons but I do not hate them and thus importance of main character is diminished. Perhaps Robbin Hood character is best description. Heroine?? Wishes she had been more attractive. Terrible thing to say, but in that middle ground between ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and Charlize Theron. She not either of these and detracted for me. So, in the end, a decent action film and recommended as that, action. Premise is interesting but not all that much to ponder or debate like some SYFY does, or can do."
3,Could have been epic...,"I was very excited to see this movie once I heard about the concept. All in all it was okay, but it could have really been amazing. Parts were slow, there was too many cheesy ""in time"" catch phrases to try to be witty but just came off lame.I would say it might be worth checking out for the concept alone but nothing to buy, you wont be watching this again..."
2,"Interesting idea, but bad acting, writing, and directing = bad movie","I was hoping these people could act, but maybe it was intentional to make them wooden. If so, I disagree with the director's intent. Plus, the writing was sooo bad and predictable. It had so much potential though - what a shame!"
4,"Time is money, and money is time","It is quite easy to see where this is going. Nobody gets to live more than 25 years unless they can work for more time, steal it, buy it, etc. Time replaces money as currency, and time is even equal to the cost of living. Those without much time are in the ghetto, while the wealthy ones have hundreds of years to play with and waste if they want to. It is a good metaphor for the haves and have-nots of our own society."
1,Too long,"This movie was very boring. I even turned it off and picked up on it the next day because I just couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. Plus, Justin Timberlake can't act."
3,So-So,This was an OK movie. The story was a good one but the acting was just so-so. Glad that it was just a rental and did not pay to see in theater.
5,Cool story,I would say probably the best science fiction movie of the last 5 years. I like the storyline. Great acting.
2,WEIRD!,This movie wad very WEIRD and HARD TO UNDERSTAND! I didn't get what was going on throughout the movie? If I were you I would not spend my money on this movie!
1,A Good Idea Wasted,"Ugh...this flick has a bad story/plot filled with a bunch of people who try to look and sound cool but don't and most of them cannot act, especially Timberlake. Seyfried slinks around exhibiting her transformation into a twig with a stupid look on her face. A puke of a film. Hardly even any unintentional comedy. Pass on it."
1,Unwatchable,"I made it through about 45 minutes of this movie. The concept was cool. However, Timberlake is not a dramatic actor. On the bright side, there is lots of unintentional comedy!"
1,Absoulte Garbage,"My all time worst movie. I should have been apid to watch this garbage. I've been better entertained at the dentists office having my teeth drilled. Did they actually pay the actors for this work? Justin timberlake is such a lightweight, he needs to find another boy band. This trash must have been written by a six year old."
2,complaint,This movie kept pausing and reloading. Out of frustration I had to terminate it so I never was able to watch it.
4,In Time is 2011's Logan's Run,Not a bad movie. better than I expected and better than the original Logan's Run since the technology was updated. JT played it well. Worth adding to your library.
1,Don't pay to see this political ad,"The acting is terrible. The socio-economic undertones, or overtones (whatever) were disgustingly blatant. Such a cool sci-fi film idea thrown away! Do not waste your money, I mean time!"
3,Late Night Rental,"The movie kept my attention, and has a neat look on future currency. However, its plot takes a weird turn towards the end. Maybe save it for discount bin."
3,Great concept but fell short,"I was very excited to see this film, as I think the idea was excellent. But somehow, it fell short and I didn't say 'wow' at the end. It was more like, 'Huh. Interesting.' Surprisingly, however, Timberlake is a good actor, and I will definitely see other films that he works on in the future."
2,Does Not Deserve Your Time,"Awkward acting, endless cliches, boring characters and a predictable plot combined in such a way to make this film barely watchable. In fact, I'm pretty sure they stole the sound effects for all the vehicles from Back to the Future."
5,Movie,"I Just absolutely love this movie, it came up as a great price (bought during black friday week) and I just totally love it. Justin is a better actor than I imagined him to be."
3,Mixed feelings,"It was just okay, nothing to rave about. I appreciated that the plot isn't something I've seen a bunch of times before, but I prefer stories that are less predictable.My husband on the other hand liked it. Either way, if you're just looking for mindless entertainment, it will do."
3,Interesting idea underutilized,"A world of class struggle. Time zones differentiate the haves from the have-nots. People live normal lives until age 25, then they live by the hour. Rich people have many hours, poor people have few. In the slums, filling up your time account is a daily chore. You never get older than 25, physically, as long as you keep your time account affluent. When your time account runs out, you are dead. You time out. You can also always choose to die in a regular manner. Being immortal requires staying away from physical damage and keeping your time account covered. Timing out has become a new mode of suicide, a convenient one.What a world of riches this idea of a sci-fi genius would have offered. Instead we are given a Bonnie and Clyde tale of substantial under-achievement. A slum boy kidnaps a rich girl and she does a Patty Hearst with him. So cute.The subject should not be forgotten, it might still be turned into a good movie."
3,What could have been...,"This movie was tough to watch...mainly because the entire time, I was thinking what a great movie this COULD have been. It almost feels like one of those great cheesy sci-fi flicks from the 1980s. I wanted to love it.What really killed this film for me was Amanda Seyfried. I don't know how this girl keeps getting parts. She isn't qualified to act in a local high school stage production, much less a major motion picture. The already terrible ""romantic"" dialogue between her and Timberlake is made infinitely worse by her patent inability to deliver any line without coming off as some sort of parody of the intended material. She should be relegated to b-list chick flicks where all the characters dance around the table blabbering about divorce and empowerment.A shame. The idea of the movie is interesting, and Timberlake is a solid enough actor. I can't help but think it would have been significantly better with an actress with even a modicum of talent."
2,Doesn't deliver,"The premise for this movie is intriguing, time and money are one and the same, putting value on a person's most limited resource.Honestly, if you knew exactly home much time left on this earth, would you waste it or make the most of it? That shouldn't be too difficult a question to answer.If you had all the time in the world, would you tire of it? That's the rub.The movie really doesn't deliver on the premise. It takes the tried and not so true path of us against them, rich vs. poor. The story limits the actors, boxing them into simplistic characters.Throw in a bit of just okay action sequences and you end up with a two star movie.It really is too bad someone dropped the ball on the concept behind this film."
2,Lost opportunity,"The premise is interesting and so much could have been done here. The cast is pretty good. Timberlake is a relatively weak link...he's a basically competent actor, but just surrounded by better ones, including Cillian Murphy and Amanda Seyfried. And, we've seen better performances from Timberlake (The Social Network, most notably) The problem here is the constant flow of cliches and standard action movie moments. There are all kinds of logical problems and plot improbabilities. I guess there a little bit of popcorn value, I guess, (including a bunch of pretty cool futuristic/retro cars) but not enough to make it worth your while."
1,worst time,i hate this movie. Worst movie ever. nothing good about. do not rent this movie cause it a waste of time.
1,Save your money and time and avoid this,"I was so pumped to see this movie. I liked the trailers and the concept and Justin Timberlake but... the pot sucked, the writing was awful, the acting was so bad and it just fell flat. Painful to watch at times. And unfortunately Justin TImberlake is not that strong enough an actor to make this movie better and also Dakota Fanning is just not a hot chick. She was a very cute young smart girl casted in the right parts. But she should stay away from trying to be this sexy woman for the big screen."
1,A great concept doesn't make a great movie.,The idea is great but the movie is trash and the acting is trash. They could've made a great movie but they didn't.
3,Not The Godfather II but still entertaining...,Entertaining movie with a classic premise of The Rich (In Time) vs The Poor. The Love of Money is the root of all evil and apparently turning time into money doesn't change things. Nice play on an age old societal issue.
3,Heard a lot about it,I'm still waiting for it to arrive. I hope this is as good as my friends say it is. Justin is a good actor
3,"Neat concept, so-so execution","I thought this was a neat story and do not regret renting it. The movie doesn't beat around the bush on the idea of ""class warfare"", and the screenplay writer was clever to make everyone stop aging in their mid-20s. That lets the director cast a bunch of popular actors and actresses, who I think did good jobs. Vincent Kartheiser stole the show as the megalomaniac banker who in any other movie would have to be played by an older actor. If you go into the movie knowing there are plot holes and inconsistencies, you can enjoy a movie worth talking about the next day."
3,Good time killer,The concept was awesome and I can't really complain about the acting. The way the story was put together and explained wasn't plausible. Even in a sci-fi world it meeds to make sense.
4,Much better than expected,"I like to be really picky about giving anything the highest rating and I am really critical about SciFi movies because a lot of times now a days its just a rehash, but this was a great movie with a very cool concept that they managed to bring to convey well, with acting, story, and pacing were all good."
4,A good movie,This is a great movie. I would consider buying it but it is out on cable now so I will record it 1 day.
3,"Interesting concept, but falls a bit flat","The story was original and not quite like anything I've seen. It starts strong in a future where you wear your life on your sleeve (literally a count down exists on your arm and if the clock runs out, you die) Got your attention yet? Oh and you don't age past 25 or something so everyone is young and good looking. Rich people have a lot of time, while poorer people end up dying in the street. Good concept, but it somehow manages to become a futuristic Bonnie and Clyde. I picked it up for $5.99 on blu ray/ dvd combo pack, so it was definitely worth that price :)"
5,Great,"In a land where the only thing valuable to people is time, this exciting movie puts the whole appreciation of time into a new perspective, one that rarely anybody may see it from that perspective!"
2,"Amazing Concept, poor execution","This script is pure gold. What an amazing concept. No more currency -- time is now the currency. Buying a cup of coffee for 4 minutes off your life. It's pure gold. It really is. However, the direction was poor, and the movie fell way short on what it could have been.Timberlake did a good job. It wasn't his fault that the director crapped the bed on this one. Justin Timberlake has pretty much solidified himself as a well rounded, excellent actor. I have no issues whatsoever with his performance. It was believable, and he did the best with what direction he was given. Cillian Murphy (Timekeeper) gave an incredible performance. It's too bad it was wasted.I was actually explaining to a friend the other day the concept of this movie, and my friend was like, ""Holy [explicit], that sounds amazing!"" And it does. Like I said, unbelievable concept. They just did not properly execute it. 2.5 stars overall."
3,In Time - Logan's Run type,Was alright and had potential to be better! Was very similar to Logan's Run but did have some unique ideas such as using time as currency!
2,Corny.,"My wife and I both were interested in the premise of this movie, but were extremely disappointed in it. The concept is okay, I guess, but the script is silly and the characters in the movie don't react at all like they would in ""real life"". The whole movie was strange and more than a little corny. We regret watching it and definitely regret paying $3.99."
3,in time,"on a scale of one to five. five being best. this was an ok 3, pleasantly surprized and enjoyed it. would recommend."
4,I loved it!,"It's exactly what the previews made it out to be. It's not an amazing movie, but the people are just right and I loved it! I had to laugh at the really bad affects of the car flip/wreck. I guess that was the movie maker's attempt to get people to take the movie for what it is and not too serious."
2,Blade Runner?,"Is it ""Blade Runner"" which also dealt with fixed lifespans? No, but then few films of this genre have ever approached that 1982 intelligent philosophical portrayal. I do give ""In Time"" some props for a potentially creative storyline but then it fell into the Hollywood shallow formula of cheap CGI (LCD time display embedded in the arm); foot and car chase scenes with bad guys; love interest with daddy's daughter; the usual rich selling out the poor storyline. Acting was passable OK with Timberlake a touch better. What was missing to me was greater depth-of-character and in particular the back story of how the whole time transfer and it's consequences was achieved. There's just too much dumbing down coming out of the film industry. Perhaps Hollywood et al. might show more social responsibility and put out some educative effort."
3,not bad,"Still don't think Justin Timberlake is an actor. The movie wasn't a snorer, but it wasn't the best.Ending was lame."
1,Boring Anti-Capitalism Movie,"The premise was interesting ... the screenplay and writing were really poor. Frankly a boring, predictable movie. And its ""in your face"" attack on capitalism got old real quick. ""Rich people are bad, and steal from poor people"". ""Poor people are victims and are only poor because the rich steal from them"". The theme got tiring after 10 minutes."
4,Timely Hidden Message,"This movie in my opinion is a brilliantly hidden message. What is the Message? The message is that we are all running out of time. Unknown to most of humanity, only the elite selected few really know the real story of the earth. There is an interface that can bring immorality to the selected ones. (And yes, it really does exist ... but it is not for the masses, unfortunately - most of humanity must indeed die. But this is really their own choice.)Some believe that this is some sort of New World Order ... but that too will be a miserable failure.How do you really change your time zone? Sorry, I can't tell you that, it is something that you must discover for yourself.This is a pretty good movie. Enjoy, hope to see you in eternity."
2,Disappointing.,"Even in today's time you can put limits on a card on how much can be spent in day. You would have Per Diems like the agent had.The movie had several good ideas the middle started to let me down and the end just got silly. All in all a let down.SPOILER******Do you really think 2 people could rob something that stores so much time with out any planning as a smash and grab? I mean the ending if 2 people could walk into a reserve with guns that society would have collapsed to lawlessness and guns rule a long time ago. They had a huge computer that told them when 1,000,000 years left but no way to void it? Anything over certain amounts would be flagged and invalidated if not legit."
3,Not bad but not great,"I think the movie has a very good concept and the store, but they could have done so much more with it.It is just an OKAY movie."
3,"WORTH AS RENTAL , AS ONE TIME VIEWING ONLY!!!!","Niccol the writer has always been good at creating tight, well-crafted screenplays that address big ideas (Gattaca, Truman Show), but this, along with ""Lord of War,"" demonstrate that he doesn't know his way around a camera. The pacing is off, the editing choppy, and the actors seem somewhat lost. Also, during the ""arm-wrestling"" scene with the gangster near the end, Niccol commits the deadlist screenwriting sin: the deus ex machina (hint: it's the hidden gun). And although this has an interesting premise, there's a huge plot hole: if the ""rich"" (signified by their decades and centuries of time) move so slowly and have no worries, why do they all look like supermodels? I would imagine they would all look like the humans in ""Wall-E."" Despite this plothole and others, as well as the general anarchist theme, I rented it & enjoyed enough of it to recommend as rental, BUT ONLY slightly.Not kinda movie, Makes U wanna re-visited again & Forgettable quicky!C+"
2,Interesting Plot,"The plot of ""In Time"" is intriguing, but the follow through is a mess. The movie really doesn't have a background, you are just thrown into the midst of everything, and expect to catch up. Maybe that's why it's called ""In Time""."
4,Draws You In,"Not sure what it is about this movie but I love it. I feel there is lots of action, mystery, thrills, and chills to meet anyone's demands. This movie is really starting to make me believe that Justin Timberlake actually has acting talent. The idea of buying everything on time to me tells people to not take for granted what they have as you may only have it for a short time before it is gone. Being only 28 years old I couldn't imagine living in a world like that; although somewhat similar to this world, you don't die here if you run out of money. Its an edge of your seat fun movie and I really enjoyed watching it with my wife. If you have a surround sound turn it up as this movie blasts some awesome sounds out throughout the entire movie. This is a good movie to watch on a Saturday night with the misses."
5,Glad I gave this a chance....,"I downloaded this some time ago. Had it sitting there for weeks. I love sci-fi but thought this would suck as I am not a timberlake fan. But glad I finally watched it because it was an amazing piece of sci-fi. Very cool, very stylish, great concept, one of those cool dystopian future movies. See Hollywood, without piracy I never would have seen this. Because of it I downloaded this, watched it, and ended up buying it on here. Thats a sale you would not have had otherwise."
2,In Time - Blu-ray - Review,"This movie had a great concept that was squandered by some pretty mediocre performances by Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seybried. I thought Cillian Murphy did a great job with the role he played, but it wasn't enough to make me like this movie when it was all said and done. It's hard for me to even recommend this movie unless you're either A.) A huge Justin Timberlake fan or B.) A huge sci-fi fan. If you're neither of these I would definitely suggest you take a pass on this, but if you do fall into one of these two categories I would make it a rental only."
3,"Cool idea, Fair Execution","I love sci-fi movies, even B rate ones. This is Bonnie and Clyde meats Robin Hood meets Equilibrium (not sure why it reminds me of that one). This was a B+ movie.The idea was pretty cool, I like the timekeeper, and I thought they did a good job making the main heroin's dad seem older, even though he's '25.' The love story was somewhat on the back-burner which was a plus, but when the heroin leaves her rich/safe life with the hero I wasn't ready to believe it yet. Overall worth watching....."
3,ehh,The movie has an interesting concept with mediocre actors. I saw this movie while on a 6hour plane to San Francisco. It was good for the situation.
4,The disparity of class in a present day reality,This movie creates an interesting alternative to the monetary system as we know it. Where would you be in this social order and would it change your thoughts on present day priorities?
2,"good story concept, but BORING!!","the story line for this movie is good, in theory, but the execution is boring. i found myself hoping it'd be over soon. the movie dragged on. very disappointing because, like i said, the concept is a cool one. i love JT, but i do NOT recommend this movie."
2,In TIme,Good concept but poorly executed. Even the best efforts of Seyfried and Timberlake could not breath life into this tired script.
2,Boring.,This is a very boring movie. That's really all I can say about this. Timberlake should stick to singing instead of acting.
1,poor,Again a movie that wasted my time and money - probably just need to give up on movies they all seem so predictable and in poor taste.
4,Good Movie,"It was a good movie if your are a sci-fi lover like myself. Pretty good movie, with a nice plot, and a good ending."
3,Well done,We really liked the concept of the movie. Not an average screen play. JT was good in it and would recommend it to a friend to rent.
3,"Awesome idea, poor execution, terrible acting.","This is an awesome dystopian future sci-fi film.Unfortunately, outside of the initial setup, the story itself was pretty lackluster. On top of that, the acting was so bad it felt like a 70's adult film. I was expecting the clothes to drop at any moment.Spoiler alert: The clothes stay on."
1,Not Blade Runner nor Gattaca,"""In Time"" had a fun concept for a movie...Hot Chicks, Cool Guys, balanced between slick and raw cinematography with virtually no CGI (don't know if that was a plus or minus, unfortunately the movie had a lot of religious storytelling (some hypocritical) but/and especially the wrong `time' period. It's a B Teen move which doesn't get too heavy, even in the passionate moment in the movie, or in the atmospherics of the environment. Time in this movie kept starting and stopping...or starting when it was stopping...and you know where this is going...or end.I laughed at the guys comment; ""I want my `time' back for watching this movie."" Another timely comment to him from me would be who gives a TIMEX about the 1% in the movie. In time planet Earth will explode and nobody lives forever."
2,"great concept, poorly executed","The potential for this movie was really good given that the concept is really original, but there are far too many holes in the story and sub-par acting that make it bad. You'll find yourself wanting way more than what this movie gives you. Kind of a shame given the fact that Justin Timberlake had an opportunity to be in a David Fincher movie (Social Network) and did well. It's a one-timer at best."
3,TIME TO KILL,"Interesting story that could have many possibilities for how it can be shown on the big screen. I found it interesting that the movie protrayed time as being more valuable than life itself. If it were to really happen, then there probably wouldn't be over-population - just slavery. I liked the movie, because it was entertaining and it raised a whole bunch of new questions about how low humanity could go. It's not a chick flick so go ahead and watch it, and be glad it doesn't take too much of your time (life) to watch it."
2,Just missed the mark,"As a fan of film and literature that focuses on dystopian futures, I found the concept of the moive to be new and exciting take on what our future will become. Like in most dystopian tales we can always find a message being relayed to the audience. The comment on the huge gap between the rich and poor was not lost on me , but I found it almost being repeated and repeated through out the movie. While the concept of time as money makes for a great film, I feel the In Time missed the mark in execution. It seemed that the story would skip around and failed to fill in some details that I would have enjoyed to know. If the story was altered , I believe that In Time would be a great movie."
4,It's not as bad as most say,"Based on my liking of most of writer Andrew Niccol's films (Gattaca [Blu-ray],The Truman Show [Blu-ray],The Terminal (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)), I decided to check out this film which seemed a bit like a rip-off ofLogan's Run [Blu-ray], albeit with a bit more detail thrown in. While not exactly the same as that 1976 sci-fi hit, I found ""In Time"" to be highly entertaining. Niccol has a way with writing sci-fi that draws in the audience, making his underdog characters likeable and weaving a generally intriguing story. The cast is stellar but it is the story here that stands out. I especially liked Niccol's metaphor with the usage of time in the film -- with time representing money and the manipulation and exploitation of this heavy demand put upon the general public in the film. For any fan of ""Gattaca,"" I'd definitely recommend this film. And if you haven't seen ""Gattaca,"" first of all, check it out; secondly, give this one a try on a night in."
5,Love,This is a great sci-fi. I love the futuristic idea of this movie. Justin is a great actor. Overall good.
4,great movie,"I honestly don't know why this has such bad reviews. I thought it was an excellent movie. Very exciting and kept you entertained the whole time. Just see it, it won't be a waste of your time, like some movies."
3,Ok film,"Nice acting, but not as believable as you would hope. action is more in line with different kind of plot, not scifi"
5,Cause the weathers so hot...,"Recorded in the fifties under the direction of Pete Rugalo,one of the great albums of the era, ""Something Cool"", is not to be missed. If you are not familiar with,"" The Misty Miss Christy"", you are in for a treat. A unique song stylist, who's voice will delight and spellbind you. This recording is the combined monoral and stereo sessions,for the album was so popular that they went back into the studio and re recorded tunes in the new process-stereo. The title tune is a story song about a woman in a bar who regales her gentleman caller with snapshots from her life-real or imagined. A great song on a disc that is loaded with memorable tunes. This is one of those ""desert island"" recordings. I'm listening to it at this very moment-it's the most!"
1,Something Cool,I have enjoyed this disc many times in my car and would recommend it to anywone who enjoys the cool jazz style of the artist. Thank you.
4,"June Christy's Something Cool, 1991 CD version","This CD is one of the re-issues. There are 24 tracks - all 11 tracks from the original Something Cool LP, two tracks that were previously unreleased (`Out of somewhere'; `Love doesn't live here anymore'), and the rest from singles or other Capitol releases. The arrangements and accompaniments are by June's frequent orchestral backing from the Pete Rugolo orchestra. So many of the classic June Christy numbers are here - `Something cool', `Midnight sun', `I'm thrilled', Kurt Weill's `Lonely house', `I should care' from bandleaders Paul Weston and Axel Stordahl with words by Sammy Cahn, Mel Tormé's `A stranger called the blues', Sigmund Romberg's `Softly as in a morning sunrise', and more. This is a first-class June Christy CD."
1,Not funny,"A book about quirky laws and lawsuits is a reasonably good idea. The book could be funny, entertaining and informative. Crazy Laws, however, fails miserably. It is not funny and not entertaining. I was bored to tears with Mr. Allen's style. If you think this book is humorous, read the United States Constitution. You'll die laughing."
1,"Racist, anti-Semitic Sewage",Here's a book that belongs in everybodys' toilet. Ben Klausen is a non-entity with the IQ of an artichoke and the morality of a sewer rat. SHUN HIM AND HIS WRITINGS!
4,Essebtial but Terrible,"I personally think that Nature's Eternal Religion is essential and should be read by every single person! The author has very good writing abilities and it is easy to read. HOWEVER!!! This book lacks realism. It is extremely racist and is basically based on nothing. It is well written but a person with such talent as the author of this book should not be wasting time on trying to convince the whole world that one religion or race is better than the other. Americans, especially, should realize that this book is written from a perspective of someone who is a pure racist and nothing else. Every race has its best and its worst and since, we, Americans live among so many different nationalities, religions, and all the races in the world, we should know this and try to work together to form a better community! Read the book though, see how stereotypical and uneal it sounds for yourself!"
5,Scatological rock of the highest caliber,Great video for Tesco fans. Lots of recently recorded laugh out loud footage along with live concert material that simply rocks. No one does toilet humor better.
5,Great Book!,"This is a very thoughtful and well put together book. It is written so that you can actually understand what's going on, without the technical jargon."
2,maybe okay for some people,"This book may be okay for some people, but it had very little information for me. I have DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) and this book had very little information about it. I felt like my type wasn't worth her time to write about since it's mostly treated with radiation therapy and surgery. And the surgeries that she mostly talks about are masectomy types. It might help you but it did not help me at all."
3,Good but a little neurotic,"I bought this book within my first week of diagnosis with early stage (II-A) breast cancer. I am the target audience for the book, and found many useful tidbits in it; unfortunately, the author seems to tend to be a worrywart. There are big differences among oncologists' recommendations, and invariably the book would sound alarms (""don't go out to concerts! don't eat a salad in a restaurant!"") that my oncologist found laughable. A lot of readers might be unduly frightened by what they read--in fact, some caution is good, but you might worry far too much because of the book's heavy emphasis on the dire. If that's your cup of tea, buy the book; as I said, there are good tidbits. Plus, it's breezy and well organized, and not at all intimidating to use as a reference. But if you take a fairly pragmatic and optimistic view, and if your oncologist does the same, I'd skip this one."
2,Only For Early Stage Cancer,"This book constatnly refers to the good results now achieved for stage I and II breast cancers. The author never even mentions later stage cancers. I was diagnosed at stage III and read most of it thinking, ""What about me? Am I doomed?"" I'm not doomed, but I would only recommend this book for women with early stage breast cancer."
2,Only for early stage breast cancer,I wish I had realized this really was for early stage breast cancer. At one point she even says if the two groups and said that if you were of the early stage you would be reading this. She often talks of the good survival rate in early stages. As I have a large aggressive tumor I do not fit into this category and therefore would not have purchased this book. In fact reading this at first made me worried and scared.A Breast Cancer Journey by ACS was much more helpful.I did give it two stars because if you do have early stage it does have some value.
5,Very helpful- full of practical tips,"I got my mother this book when she was first diagnosed and found it very helpful for both of us. The ""Do's and Don'ts"" section for friends and family is indeed very useful, as previous reviewers state. I suspect that little tips like how to avoid mouth sores when getting chemo (suck on ice!) are likely to be worth the price of the book. I also recommend the two books by John S. Link, which are slightly heavier reading but go into more technical detail on the very latest treatment options such as ""dose-dense"" regimes."
1,quite ugly and looks very cheap,"Ordered this item for my girlfriend. It arrived damaged- 1 pearl was missing. Also, it doesnt look good and i would not buy it even for $5 if i new it will look that cheap."
4,Smooth sounds from the dining rooms,"The music was smooth and jazzy. No techno beats, no looped computer crap ran through a mixer over and over again. Nice horns and vocals. Something to listen to while sitting in a comfortable chair, sipping on a warm drink and spending time with that special someone."
2,Disappointing,"A writer with too much talent and too little ability to know when to stop--to stop a sentence, to stop an analogy, to stop altogether. This books needs a very good editor of a kind which no longer seems to exist--Max Perkins, for example. This book is like the housing bubble, way out of line with reality. It is difficult for me to believe that so many reviewers and readers have been praising this book, with few suggestions that it is overdone and BORING!"
4,complex and excellent,"The common criticisms of Powers' work - too much intellect at the expense of feeling, a too-heavy reliance on dialectic, theme at the expense of character - have never really resonated with me. With The Time of Our Singing, Powers has again summoned art and science, thought and feeling, to produce a powerful, moving, and thought-provoking novel. I've read a few reviews that criticize the 'musical' passages as boring, but I believe they do capture, very precisely, the sense of being caught up and suspended in a musical work.The conflation/opposition of music and time is a very meaningful metaphor for a life lived (or a long novel) - certainly no musical work, or life, or book could make sense if it happened all at once, or never happened, or always happened. Events stack up in time, like chords, and this book is a veritable symphony."
3,Many Old Ideas,"I really like Powers - as a scientist I appreciate his ability to write intelligently about a world that includes maths and physics - and I have read many of his books. I'm unsure what order they were published in, so it may be that what follows would apply to another book if you are reading in chronological order, but this book contained many ideas (motifs? ticks?) from the work I was already familiar with.In particular, there's a long (this is not a short book) rehash of ""relationship failing due to sense of indebtedness"". I assume this is taken from the author's own life (I recall something similar in (what I assume was) the semi-autobiographical Galatea 2.2). Richard Powers, if you're reading this: please, get over it. I am tired of paying to be your therapist. OK?The historical context was fascinating - I learnt a huge amount - but both Goldberg and Galatea are better books. At least, if you read them before this one."
3,disappointing effort,"Powers' latest novel is a disappointment. A novel of race and music, of two brothers from a mixed marriage, it is leaden and repetitious. How does one describe music? Powers can only pile up the superlatives as he again and again celebrates the effect of Jonah's voice on his audience. We get it.Several incidents stretch belief. Would a mixed couple really be spat on and reviled in upper Manhattan in the fifties? Would Jonah really ride into the Watts riot for a closer look?The best parts are a brief account of the Till murder and the account of the meeting of David and Delia at the Easter, 1939 Anderson concert at the Lincoln Memorial.Powers has no sense of humor and no sense of irony. His last two novels are far less engrossing than ""Gain"" and his best, ""The Gold Bug Variations.""Reviewers seem to give him credit for taking on a large issue, race in America. But read ""Atonement"" for a good novel!"
1,What about Kindle version?,"I wanted to purchase this books for my Kindle. I already have in paperback, but the text is too small for me... Any news on a Kindle Edition (available in Europe, by the way)?"
3,DON'T BOTHER AFTER THE FIRST SIX SONGS,NOT ONE OF BARRY'S BETTER ALBUMS. THE FIRST SIX SONGS ARE GREAT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING WHEN HE RECORDED THE REST.
2,"Silly, confusing but culturally interesting","Marshall jumps from character to character so quickly in this book that it's quite confusing to follow. One creepy criminal is throwing spoiled fruit juice bombs into people's cars in Manila Bay, meanwhile a ""cockfight"" is disrupted by gunshots. The way the entire plot unravels is quite unbelievable, but for people who like to read books where the bodies stack up (unfortunately, sometimes, that's me), it's a fairly good read."
4,Daily nourishment for broken souls,"This book is a great daily reading for anyone but especially one who may experience low self-esteem. The little snippets at the bottom of each page are worth the book. They can be copied, memorized or just reread to be reminded of the importance of self-worth."
5,Great Quotes,"This was an easy read which I needed at the time. I found so many quotes I loved inside. There were a few sections that did not apply therefore were not very good, but the majority of it was so helpful."
3,Not what I expected - the usual,your average recovery book. It's concise and to the point. It's a quick read. I can read it in less than a couple of hours.Do not pay no more than 5.00 for a used copy of this book.
1,Did not work,"I bought this product so I could charge my BlackBerry on a trip to Ireland. It did not work (no charging and charging icon did not show on BB screen). There was no way to check it prior to the trip. So, this meant I had to buy the adapter there -- buying it twice, the Ireland cost being quite high. (The one I bought in Ireland charged very slowly, but it did charge and the being charged icon showed on the BB screen.) I feel certain the company would have accepted a return, but since I couldn't test it here, that did me no good. Plus carrying it around on the rest of the trip and the return postage on this low cost item didn't make it worth while."
2,Pending,The item ordered is not working for my storm (connection is loose) blackberry connects fine with my car charger. I am in the process of exchanging item.
2,No USB,Do not be deceived by the images: it does not come with the USB. It came in fast though and I hope it'll work...
1,It does NOT fit my Blackberry BOLD 9000,I bought 3 of these to use with my Blackberry BOLD 9000 but it does NOT fit.
1,Image shown was not item received,"Instead of receiving the BlackBerry international charger, I received a Nokia US wall charger. I am returning the item, for I have no use for a Nokia charger."
5,Perhaps the most beautiful book I have ever bought,"I've been familiar with Jael's super illustrations for a long time, but nothing prepared me for this book of her work, which concentrates largely on her fine art -- fabulously imaginative paintings that have almost all never been seen in print before. It's nearly impossible to describe them, because they don't obey any of the inhibiting rules that other fantasy artists tend to adhere to. This is a real breakthrough book, and the kind you'll want to buy extra copies of to give to your most special friends. It's lovely!"
2,Where is the Inspiration?,"Keneally is, no doubt, a skilled and knowlegabel writer, and this novel based on the story of Joan of Arc is very well researched, but as the story of a brave and mystical hero, it's a dry and inhumane read which lacks passion, courage and inspiration. It's all too rational, too predictable, too over-explained."
5,la importancia del legado politico de Guevara,"En la actualidad general de brigada en las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Cuba, Harry Villegas trabajo y lucho durante una decada al lado de Ernesto Che Guevara: en Cuba, el Congo y Bolivia. Villegas habla de las luchas en las que participo a lo largo de cuatro decadas, entre ellas la derrota en 1988 del ejercito del apartheid sudafricano en Cuito Cuanavale en Angola. Explica, sobre todo, la importancia del legado pol?tico de Guevara para una nueva generacion de combatientes en el mundo.While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!"
4,Very solid guitar,"I purchased mine from Guitar Center about a year ago. Guitar is simply beautiful. For my money there has never been a nicer looking guitar than the Les Paul, it just screams classic rock. Very comfortable to play, it isn't a Gibson, but most players don't have the money to purchase a Gibson when they are first starting.The only minor complaint being the stock pick-ups are little muddy. I added a couple of Seymour Duncan humbuckers and had the action lowered which greatly improved the sound and ease of playing. Play this guitar through a Line 6 Flextone and you can have really good tone for under a grand."
5,Best lesbian sci-fi I've read,"There's no sub-text here! No coy looks or cuddles -- this story is about LESBIANS. It's a great story, too. I really liked Maddy's character. She's very real and funny. All these unbelievable things start happening to her and she really doesn't believe them until she has proof. It's way better than the X Files. Really diverting, I read it in a long night. It was a terrific roller coaster all the way. I laughed a lot, got goosebumps, cried twice and almost had to wake up my girlfriend after some really amazing ... passages. Totally FIVE stars. This should be a movie!"
5,I liked this even more than The Dawning,"I read The Dawning first and liked it so much I wanted to read the first book. I liked this book even better. The plot is very tight, the central mystery intriguing and utterly believable when resolved. It is the foundation for everything that unfolds in The Dawning. Rather than everything working out for everyone in the next book we find that everyone has hit one roadblock or another and I liked that dose of reality. I have the feeling that an entirely new world is going to be laid out for us to savor and I can't wait. The message of both books so far is that hope is worth it and people can be better than they are. Given the daily news I can't hear this message enough."
3,Just OK,"For me this book was just an okay read. I am not a big fan of sci-fi, but I have read several that I really enjoyed. This one...not so much.A group of lesbians save Sirena, a female alien who has been communicating with them via their dreams. Sirena has a telepathic and sexual connection to Maddy. Maddy is the storyteller so we see things from her befuddled perspective. While the ending could be considered 'happy', it left me wondering, ""what next?"" There could have/should have been a sequel.I liked that the group came to the rescue in a beat up, borrowed camper. They had no weapons, no high tech gadgets and gizmos, no martial arts, and no kick-ass, superhuman beauty to save the day. They prevailed with good old fashioned lesbian camaraderie and intelligence.This book is an oldie, Naiad Press. I knew it had been sitting on the shelf for a long time but boy, was I surprised to see a 1997 copyright date!"
4,Winter,"The books are organized into life phases and seasons, and this book is a good read about a girl growing up in the southwest."
4,watch pins,there are a lot of these spring bars in this little box so don't tip it the wrong way or you will be picking up pins for a long time.
2,Too thin,Spring bars are very thin. I am sure they will break in very little time. Almost broke just putting it in. I would not buy these again. I really regret my purchase.
4,This isn't in large print.,"I started my search looking for large print books for my mother, who has macular degeneration. This was one of the books that I found in my search. Since this was written for people with a vision problem and includes a list of large print publishers, I assumed, incorrectly, that this would be large print as well. It's larger than some paperbacks, but not as large as the other two books I bought. I am hoping my mother will be able to use it."
4,Macular Degeneration,Since I have macular degeneration it Helped me understand it.It reassured me I will not become completely blind. Also gave me tips for living with it.
3,Fast Reference Guide to Investment Decisions,"This small book is a quick reference guide for financial terms and principles, with a focus on the realm of paper assets. Here are a few of the valuable points:--The average annual total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 since 1926 has been between 10 percent and 11 percent.--A fairly ""neutral"" asset allocation is 60 percent stocks (or stock mutual funds), 30 percent bonds (or bond funds), and 10 percent cash (money-market accounts, certificates of deposit, bank savings accounts, checking accounts, Treasury securities). If you are on the more aggressive side, add to your stock holdings and lower your bonds holdings.... If you are still at loss in terms of how to allocate your assets, a good rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 110; this is the percentage of assets that should be in stocks or stock mutual funds.This is a great little book that is fast to read, but remains within reach to explain in simple terms the big concepts we use."
3,Detailed Account Of U-Boat Operations,"The first reviewer has covered everything that can be said or needs to be said about this book. A bit like Clair Blay's U-Boat War, this is a very detail account of U-Boat operations during May 1943 which the author shows to be the critical period of the war in the Atlantic. The author has gone to great lengths to cover every facet of this period including the men, equipment and tactics however after a while it starts to be abit too much. I started to miss the human element in the story and found that the facts and figures were getting in the way of the story. I might be wrong as I read this book while on night shift and I was probarly tied but I found it hard to keep reading after about 180 pages. However it must be said that the author is to be commended on the amount of research he has taken to put this book together. If you want an in-depth account of U-boat operations in the Atlantic you couldn't do much better than this book."
3,Too much at times,"Though informative and revealing at the outset, a full, ""complete"" account of a multitude of tiny military encounters will inevitably succumb to repetition, and Black May falls prey to this danger. Only a pedant or someone interested in minute details will appreciate the massive list of U-boat sightings and depth charge attacks. Personally, Gannon had lost me by the halfway mark. I could have gone straight to the conclusion and missed nothing really important.I did, however, enjoy the technical descriptions of allied equipment, as well as that of the different U-Boat types."
3,"Many facts & numbers, little excitement!","In a period of great U-boat battles, this book has only about 100 pages of eye witness accounts and riviting narrative. If you are in to details and names with long titles, then this book is for you. This book is more for the historical researcher than for the person who enjoys battle narratives."
4,Very detailed but not an easy read..,"If you are looking for a Tom Clancy style novel this is not the book for you. If you want ALL the details of what happened during WWII regarding Anti-sub warfare and German sub warfare you need this book. Michael is very detailed about names, places, ship numbers, tactics, weapons..you name it. Some times it gets a bit hard to read with all the technical info flying past but well worth it for the history buff."
3,An historical account of the War against U-Boats,"This book is not written as a novel, and would be a disappointment for someone looking for an easy reading book. It is an historical account of events related to the war against German U-Boats in the Bay of Biscay and the North Atlantic, with emphasis on the turning of the tide against the German submarine service in May 1943. It is well reseached but sometimes digresses a little too much into minute detail. It also skips around a bit, and drops back to explain various developments. It is a good account for someone interested in the background details as well as the details of various actions that took place."
4,A Black May It Was.,"Michael Gannon is a fine writer, and his subject matter lends itself to his style. One can almost imagine what it was like to sit inside that steel tube waiting for death from above. And you can't help but admire the courage of these German sailors, who crewed the boats. Most were not Nazis, but rather, ordinary seamen fighting for their country, not their fuhrer. Yet they shipped out over and over again, until over 30,000 of them were dead. A loss rate of over 75%."
3,"Good, expected more though.","I expected alot more out of who Mike Jones on this one. His dissing isnt as good, but Jones still better. still buy this album cause the dvd is worth it. and if u aint got the money just ask ya moms."
3,Alright CD mostly remakes,"Mike jones has a great flow, he reminds me a lil bit of the late biggie, exept biggie talk more when he spit. If mike would quit sayin his name and his number so much he would make a great rapper. He keeps saying the same things about chamil. If he was gone do that he should have put in one or two songs. This cd is aight, but it could have been better."
5,"""OUT OF ALL 3 DISKS, WE AIN'T HEARD ONE HIT....""","I like the album cover, where Jones got Chamil' locked in a cage! Mike Jones' six songs made Chamillionaire's 13 tracks look like garbage!!! I got a lot of respect for MJ for leaving the beef to a minimum. I still don't understand why Chamil' beefing...they both got skills, but Mike Jones' flows are a lot more presistant! This CD showed his talent to the fullest...you can tell he saving his best flows for the Majors. Plus, he can also rhyme w/o saying his name all the time!!! I didn't hear ""Who? Mike Jones...Mike Jones"" as much as the other mixtapes, but this beef is pretty much a done deal w/King of the Streets on top.Question...Why Chamillionaire still flossin' the SWISHA HOUSE chain on the Mix Tape Messiah album cover, when he said he won't return 'cause they did him wrong?!"
1,dont waste your money,"this and all of his cd's are terrible!!!! all he does is say his name and his cell phone number over and over again..his lyrics are terrible....mike jones is fake, and everybody from the streets in H-TOWN HAS NO RESPECT FOR THIS DUDE!!!!! HE IS A SNITCH AND A TERRIBLE RAPPER......go buy a Z-RO cd, HE'S A REAL RAPPER FROM H-TOWN!!"
1,Strait Garbage,"On the real you got to be on sumthin else to think this CD is worth 2 pennies. this CD is definently a Discrace to Rappers out of Texas. If yo thang is Gimmik Rappers and people who snitch on their team than this is the album for you. if you got a thing for really bad lyrics and want to hear the same verse over and over than go ahead and cop this trash. I dont understand how anybody real and is ""street"" can give this clown props. how u gonna get props for snitchen and talkin down on your team. I aint really siding on either side cham or mike jones but cham did say it the best...""where's your team? i dont see your team cuz on your team u be snitchen."
1,Raw Proof Any Moron Can Make A Million Dollars,"Good God, I've never heard anything so repulsive in my life, this idiot takes different well known beats and just moronically babbles over them.hardly even comparable to the worst rap out there. Mike Jones is not only an disturbing embarassment to the rap game, but just a wretched stain to the music world in general. I feel angered I had to hear his name, and see him on my television. This cd doesn't even deserve a decent review.Will someone just flush this abomination of a dunce for good?Oh when does the MTV invasion digress?!?!?!?!?!?!"
3,There's no way....,"There is no way this cd can touch any of chamillionaire's cds. I heard about this cd havin a diss about chamillionaire, and it blows my balls. If you want a real cd check out chamillionaire's 'Mixtape Messiah"" cd or any of his cds.P.S. F**k Dyke Jones!"
1,Historical Account - C'mon!!!,"The book is repleat with factual errors and misrepresentations.Reynolds facts are often wrong, his attributed sources are fiction and his opinions are offensive - and without much foundation. This 'would be' film script ready imaginative story qualifies as an inaccurate reconstruction of the actual event and are refuted in detail by precise and detailed description written nearer the time by Capts Lindsay and Johnston in the History of the 7th Armoured Division of Sept '45. Incidentally, though Reynold's footnotes assert this book is 'unpublished', I have a copy on my bookshelf it has been there since late '45. I can also say that Brig. Hinde's personal driver (his scout car driver on june 13th 44 has not been contacted by Reynolds and does not support his 'story'."
2,A Disappointing Dry Book - Skip It,"This book is a very dry, textbook-like telling of the SS Divisions in Normandy. Lots of unit numbers, geographic references, and the like."
1,A good book ruined - a ripoff. Don't waste your money,"The hardcover edition I received is the most slovenly and incompetently produced book I have ever had the misfortune to spend money on. And I spend a lot of money on history books. The first third of the book was completely unreadable because an intermitant series of pages had not been printed. I wonder how many reviewers actually read the book, considering that they fail to report this glaring and incomprehensible defect. If the publishers had any pride and decency, they would have pulped this edition and reprinted it. Selling rubbish like this is a disgrace. I want my money back."
4,A very good read,A very enjoyable read. You felt that you really understood the tatics of the 2 waffen ss divisions. Whilst Reynolds writing style is very factual the narrative flows well (better than his first book) Anyone interested in Normandy (particularly the battle of Caen) should read
3,Interesting book.,"This book is a study of one particular SS unit and its' battles in Normandy as told from the German perspective in quite a bit of detail. I thought it was rather dry prose, almost academic."
4,Well Researched & Presented Account of the 1SS Panzer Corps,Once again Michael Reynolds has produced a very fine book full of detail and interesting narrative from the participants. The book covers the campaign and battles conducted by the 1SS Panzer Corps in Normandy during 1944. This unit was made up of the experienced veterans of the 1SS and the young men/boys of the 12SS and it gave a good account of itself fighting against the Allies in and around Caen and the bocage & hedgerows. Overall this is a very well researched and presented book with lots of detail which should please anybody who has an interest in the Normandy campaign or the Waffen SS (the author also covers the war-crimes committed by both sides).
1,exploding oven,"this morning, with the oven off, it exploded --glass flew all over the kitchen------in our case, the top blew off------checking online, it appears this is an ongoing theme-----others have exploded too--Amazon and anyone else who carries this oven should stop selling the item--------someone could get seriously hurt"
2,"Good oven, but controls gave out","We like the features and performance of this oven quite a bit. We bought it to replace a regular old toaster oven. The T-Fal toasts very evenly and I can fit a whole frozen pizza in it!The bad part is that after about 2 weeks of service, the controls work only very intermittently. This means that all functions behave at their default settings--no temperature or time adjustments. Luckily, the default setting for toast is just barely on the brown side for us, still edible. It's annoying to have what is otherwise a fine oven so befouled by unusable controls. It would have received a 5."
4,Does the job.,"I just cleaned my T-fal. That tells you two things. One it's easy to clean and two I like it enough to keep it clean.The warmer conveniently warmms. The toaster completley toasts. The convection quickens baking time. It broils just fine. It looks good doing it. It is deep rather than wide, and, while the fowl pictured is prabably just a cornish game hen, it's pretty big for a toaster oven. Six halves of bagels a bit squished is my high score.Minor detractions: I forget to press start when I've set the time and temp, and it hasn't been made to accommodate two shelves at a time."
3,Good unit with a few flaws,"After using this unit daily for about 2 months, I only have a few complaints:-toast not always cooked evenly, depending on where on the tray it sits-tray in the ""up"" toast-position has a lip that prevents sliding the toast straight out onto the plate-bread in the warmer must be put on a tray, not directly on the cooking surface (and don't keep in there more than 10 min)-when toasting ""moist"" bread, the condensation also gets into the LCD display, which may cause problems down the roadPerhaps this unit isn't perfect for toast, but it's great for other stuff. The convection function is fast and I love cooking hot dogs or chicken nuggets in this."
1,Shattered Glass Everywhere!,"I bought it Dec. 2006 for Christmas, and it worked OK. As other reviewers stated, it takes FOREVER to toast, among other issues including noise. I thought I could live with that. Then the unthinkable happened this morning - the glass top exploded all over my kitchen counter and floor! Thank goodness my kids were no where near it when it went off (the handle went flying, too)! I checked the CPSC website and could not find anything on this product.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Major safety issue!!"
3,"Well made, but not sure what all the hype is about","cons:1)Doesn't toast any better than the 20 year old toaster oven it replaced (though it doesn't burn the toast like the old one which had a failing sensor--unless you set the timer too long). I finally believe what I've read numerous times--if you want good toast buy a $20 toaster.2) Sounds like a helicopter in your kitchen. To keep it reasonably quiet I've had to play around with balancing it on pieces of cork in different ways, and even then the door still rattles. I gather noise is a problem for other convection ovens as well, but this is ridiculous.3) Haven't found much use for the warmer--I'd rather have the space inside the main oven (which might even allow room for two racks). Incidentally, the ""chicken"" in the oven in the picture must be a game hen, or possibly a pigeon.4) The broiling tray is too small for the pan it goes in.pros:1) Reasonably well built.2) Looks cool."
4,It's BIG!,"Works as well as any other toaster oven, but it's so darn big. It takes up so much room on my counter. If you like big, this one is for you."
3,Great toaster oven...for the first three years,"This is an awesome convection oven that also toasts bread. We've used it for steaks, burgers, pizza, etc. and it has worked great. However, after three years, it died. Since it is outside of its one year warranty period, and the dismal number of repair centers in the US, I'll have to discard it and buy something different. The T-Fal website did not offer any replacement parts nor any FAQs or repair manuals. Also, doing a google search yeilded no no help. Again, a great product, but it didn't last longer than three years. I would have given it five stars if it was still working."
2,Nothing but trouble,"After 2 weeks LED malfunctioned. Cost 22 dollars to ship for service. Returned in... yes, 9 weeks to us and LED worked but oven went on by itself!!!! TFAL sent us another which sounds like a motor boat or a car without a muffler. Have yet to see the 22 dollars which by warranty is due us for a defective product sent for service. Buy a cheap toaster oven at Walmart and save yourself a lot of grief!!!!"
3,"Works well, but noisy","I am pretty happy with this toaster, although I am disappointed at the level of noise when using the convection function. I have read a couple of other reviews where the rattling fan quieted down after a couple of uses - mine has been used now for 5 to 6 hours on convection at a minimum and it has made no difference.In addition, when setting the clock, the numbers do not run more rapidly after holding the plus or minus buttons for several seconds, which makes setting the clock a pain.It would have been nice to have the option to select conventional or convection when using the bake function. As it is, bake is convection only.In spite of the above, I am pretty pleased with the unit - there are plenty of good aspects about this toaster; size, warming compartment, evenness of toasting, and the removable crumb tray. Given other units on the market, not a bad purchase at all - simply could be easily made better!"
4,Latest One Louder But Quite Acceptable Otherwise,"The T-Fal OT8085002 Avante Elite Convection Toaster Oven purchased on Jan. 3 is my second -- obviously I liked the first -- and, other than the fan being louder, it is an excellent machine and likely I wouldn't know it is loud if not for the contrast. The first one suddenly was ""dead,"" no sign of life nor seeming way to revive it in it's second year of service. The T-Fal representative with whom I spoke via telephone told me assuredly that they have few calls of problems with the Avante Elite Convection Toaster Oven and so I was willing to try again. This was reinforced when American Express credited my credit card account for the initial purchase price under the company's automatic extended warranty on products purchased using the card! Coincidentally only this morning I again noticed the slightly higher noise of the fan as I was on-line waiting for muffins to bake and received the invitation from Amazon.com to provide this review."
5,No hot kitchen!,I am able to cook casseroles in the Avanti that normally I would have to cook in my regular oven. It is wonderful!
5,I Luv Amazon!,"I have purchased many things on Amazon and have never been disappointed. My toaster oven was delivered in very fast time (quicker than projected delivery date). And it is beautiful. A great addition to my kitchen. I have used a few other, less expensive brands in the past and this oven far exceeds them. It not only looks good, but cooks good too!"
4,thank goodness!,"After two disappointing tries with a new Krups toaster oven, I ordered this one three weeks ago. My only minor complaint is the thermostat is off by 25 degrees, but I set it at 375 if I want 350. I am pleased!"
1,Stopped working after 3 months!,I am unhappy with this purchase. Today the oven/toaster did not respond to any commands (not a fuse or plug problem). I've owned this for 3 months. I've used this frequently with no previous problems. The company states that I need to return this to them and I need to pay shipping! I will get a response from them in 2-6 weeks. I need an oven soon and depend on this certainly during the holidays. Note: There is a 1 year warranty!Buyer beware!
3,"When it works, I love it... then it dies","I have had two of these in my home. When it works, great! Then it dies, anyone else had this problem? The first lasted 5 hours and then no power and it wouldn't work again. The second lasted 7 days. Same thing, no clock, no power. I am going to try a THIRD time and if it doesn't work... I give up."
5,Works great,"I got this on a good deal a couple of years ago. It works great for me. I like the digital controlls. It's very easy to clean as well, and the crumb tray is easilly accessible. Looking forward to using this for many years to come."
1,died within first month of use,This item worked fine for two weeks and then died. Am returning for full refund
4,"Good Appliance, funky appearance","We purchased this item for our office and so far so good. It's great for toast and and cooks evenly which is more than some of the high-end brands can say. I don't know when the bun-warmer will come in use, we'll have to get creative. This is the only toaster oven with consistent good reviews. The competition has a lot of quality control issues their reviews are all over the board... Go Avante Elite!"
5,Cooks perfectly,No more preheating my oven for a slice of pizza or a biscuit. This oven cooks perfectly. It even does toast! And it's so easy to clean. I love it.
5,Russell Starner,"I received the item on time and was very happy with the features that the oven offered. I was looking for an oven that offered ""toasting, warming, broiling, and conventional features. I looked at other ovens with the features that I wanted but none of them came close. The price was just right for what I was willing to pay for such a good quality oven. I would say that the value of this oven is worth over $150. I would hightly recommend this oven if your looking the features mentioned above. However the only draw back to the oven is that it must be kept unplugged at all times (outside of being in use)."
4,Enjoy my Avante Elite Toaster Oven,"My Avante Elite comes in handy for quick snacks or just as an extra oven. I can make nachos, toast, warm up left-over garlic bread or make new garlic bread in it. My only disappointment was I anticipated it would be alittle bigger, but I am well pleased with the quality and performance."
3,HUGE toaster oven,"Although this oven does everything from toast to broil, convection bake, or warm it is HUGE. Takes up so much counter space, I wound up returning it! If you have tons of space, and want a do-it-all counter oven, then go for it."
4,Much better than a regular toaster oven,"I did a lot of research before I bought this oven. I wanted an oven that was large enough to cook casseroles, etec, but that didn't take up a lot of space. This oven does the trick!It's very stylish, but more importantly, it holds a regular casserole dish, a muffin tin, or a bread pan easily. It will also hold a 12 inch pizza, and cook it perfectly.The convection doesn't save as much time as I thought, but the most important thing is that I don't have to heat the large oven (and the house) to cook a casserole.When using the ""toast"" function, I always let it preheat before putting the toast in. Other wise the toast is pretty hard, instead of crispy.I like it so much, I've ordered one for my daughter who is getting married in April"
4,Just a Few Problems,"I bought this oven because of other people's favorable reviews and I am very satisfied with it. The outside stays very cool, unlike a metal sided one that I bought first and returned because it got so hot. It holds all standard size bakewear. It broils very nicely without flareups and will do bacon in about 6 minutes. The broiler pan is high quality baked on enamel, the same material you would find in your regular oven. I use it frequently to bake things like banana bread that I don't want to heat up the big oven for.My complaints are: The settings go to 500 degrees but no matter how long I preheat I can not get it up even to 400 degrees (I used an oven thermometer to check).And, the shelves are very unstable when you pull them out, there is no check to hold them in place and they will fall forward if you don't hold them up with a mitt when you remove things from the oven.Nevertheless, I like it better than any other I've seen and recently gave one to friend as a gift."
2,Tefat Alante' Convection Toaster Oven,"Unit is nice looking. Works fine: makes good toasts, does a good job of baking/rewarming and grilling.Unfortunately, the unit received by us was making a loud grinding noise in the Bake Mode (perhaps fan noise caused by fan blades rubbing against the housing). This noise was clearly unacceptable.The unit has been returned for warranty service via prepaid shipping that was provided by the company. Results: unknown at this point."
5,"It took 26 years, but we finally found an excellent toaster oven","Great product. Easy to use, quality materials and wormanship, and it makes great toast! Convection feature a big plus. Only downside is the amount of space dedicated to the warmer - but even that is a great feature. Even comes with tongs to pull out hot tray and pick up toast."
4,Good Convection Oven,"The T-Fal OT8085002 Avante Elite Convection Toaster Oven is a great buy. We wish the timer lasted longer though, but overall we like this attractive product with its unique design. The price was good and the rebate offer made it even better!UPDATE 2009: Since our purchase in early 2007, the oven still works great."
5,Great product!,We love the T-Fal Convection Toaster Oven. Operation is easy and intuitive. It actually browns toast just as good if not better than regular toaster ovens. As an oven it is superior. The warming tray is a great feature. The Ti-Fal is very nice looking as well.
1,Plugged it in and found it inert,"I unpacked this item and plugged it into a wall socket. The little display lit but none of the buttons worked. No functions were available for use. I repacked the toaster oven and shipped it back to Amazon for about $22+ having printed a return label. Strangely, the return had to be paid by me with a refund promised. My refund from Amazon amounted to $10. I went to the local USPS office and found out that I could not have returned the toaster oven for 10.00.I am a long time Amazon customer and have reordered a second toaster oven from Amazon. So, $12.00 is not all that much money ... I wonder why or what I missed cautioning me about using UPS (ground) for the return ... better yet, telling me the amount of the refund at the time of the printing of the return label. Oui??"
3,nice size and look - uneven toasting - short life,"Love the size, perfect footprint for kitchen countertop. However, cannot fully lift lid unless pull out from under kitchen wall cabinets. Not a big deal - just an FYI. Convenient and easy to use. Toasts somewhat unevenly - no matter where on rack you place toast, nor whether you toast one or 4 slices of bread. Over time (purchased this a 22 months ago) the toast setting had to be increased from 3 to now 7 - thus anticipate the need to replace in near future. Basically - nice looking, toasts adequately, oven works well, but seems to be on its way out in less than 2 years. This is second Avante (first was basic toaster) that doesn't toast evenly and burns out too quickly. Will move on to a different brand in future."
2,T-Fal Avante Toaster Oven,"Great oven,somewhat easy to use but the racks will fall out if you not careful removing toasted items and they are HOT! No bell or indication when items are done. Follow instructions for cooking carefully. 5 minute toast or english Muffin.I don't think I would have bought this had I known the rack and buzzer(or lack thereof)problems. Very LARGE on counter."
4,"Great, but","The oven baked bread great, but the first loaf fell to the floor since the shelf is not supported when pulled out and tips down. Since then I have learned to support the shelf and have not lost another baked item. cj"
4,Pizza perfection!,"From frozen pizza to potatoes to Lean Cuisine, this one does it well and does it faster. The only question now is longevity. Having a Deluxe frozen 12"" rising crust pizza done to perfection in 20 minutes was worth it to me! The downside? Toasting bread takes longer than I'd like, but I use a toaster for that task. If you want something to quickly toast six slices of bread, I'd look elsewhere; if you want frozen goods done well and done fast, look no further."
4,Excellent transaction,"Great product. A little large than I expected but good product with multiple functions. Also, the delivery was timely and instructions found."
3,T-Fal Toaster Over,"The first (1st) unit worked twice, and the third (3rd) time nothing worked; no display or anything.The replacement unit which arrived about 10-days later has worked once a day for 9-days now.Do NOT expect it to toast bread as well as a toaster, but it will cook & broil food nicely."
3,gets the job done,"I often heat up small things and didn't want to use the large oven for it....this does the job, but I think the whole warming area at the top was a mis-step. It takes up a lot of room that could be given to the oven - and let you put larger things in it. It also makes such a small open area when the baking pan is used that I frequently burn my knuckles.Good toaster oven - but lose the warming thing. They suggest you could fry an egg in it - but why would you want to?"
4,Great oven with consistent cooking results.,"PRO's--The product delivers as promised, probably due to convection heating.Easy to clean up in main compartment.CON's-- You have to use a tray on the top, otherwise food items stick to it , and are difficult to remove. Also in the same vein, the top compartment requires a lot of headroom, and it is difficult use under a kitchen cabinet without banging the glass lid when gaining access to it. Need a little better design to allow variable time and temperatures."
5,great product,"Have had this toaster oven for just over 10 days and so far, i love its looks. It bakes/heats evenly and the buttons/keys are all pretty intuitive.Havent used all the features yet but so far I love it."
4,Very Satisfactory,"The oven works like a charm, doing a fine job of toasting & baking, which I do almost every day. The door rattles a bit when the convection fan is going, so I just lay something heavy on top of the handle, and it's fine - I love it!"
2,lots of problems with this unit,"The first unit I was shipped had the one side broken in...this was the side with the convection fan. (The sides of the oven are made of plastic.) I returned it, and Amazon promptly shipped me a new one. This one looked to be in mint condition. I actually cooked a piece of toast in it, and it turned out perfect. But when I tried to heat up a sandwich on the Bake setting, after 2 minutes, when the convection fan kicked in, it made this hideous noise like a machine shop saw...very loud. I shut it off right away. I tried it again later, and the same thing happened. I am returning the unit and purchasing a different type of convection oven. I don't think this oven is built with durable-enough materials and apparently is not tested before shipping."
4,Good,"First toaster oven I've had that cooks toast evenly. It's the slowest oven I've ever had however. Overall, I'm pleased."
4,Good bang for the buck,"This product has good and useful features, and had a great price when we bought it. We have used all of the features, and found them to work well and have had no problems with it. Considering we use it every day (at least once), it has held up well."
1,Bad experience,"Not only is this toaster oven bulky, but the warmer burns things if not watched closely.Then, slightly after the warranty had expired, the toasting and baking capability stopped.Do NOT advise buying this product."
3,"Nice toaster oven, but a bit slow.","T-Fal OT8085002 Avante Elite Convection Toaster OvenThis toaster oven does the job, but a bit slower than I would like. It has all the bells and whistles -- you can bake a pizza at 500 degrees. But ordinary toast takes about five minutes. The controls are easy and intuitive; the design is fine -- it is a bit bigger than most toaster ovens. The price is right."
1,very dangerous oven!!!!,"I have had this oven for almost a year and I have loved it. I reseached and bought this oven because of the good reviews on amazon.com.All of the food I have prepared in the oven has been great -- BUT -- I just cooked some pork chops and I had opened the oven door and cut a piece of meat, closed the oven door and put the piece of meat on a plate in front of the oven to see if it was cooked.Suddenly the top glass shattered, the handle from the top landed on my plate and there was glass on the counter top and the floor. I am lucky I was not hurt.I immediately called t-fal and they are closed for the weekend -- I will be calling them Monday morning and I do expect my money returned -- I would not want a replacement oven.I came here to see if this has happened to anyone else, and apparently it has.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS OVEN.And I am disappointed because I liked it so much."
2,"OK toast, but lousy grilling/broiling","I boutght this for two reasons.I live alone and want to keep a loaf of bread in fresh in the freezer, and want tothrow a couple of frozen slices in the toaster and forget them.And I want to grill (broil) single portions of things like chicken breasts or steaks without messing up the large broiler in my stove.The T-fal makes OK toast (though it does tend to dry out the bread) but the grill function simply doesn't get hot enough, fast enough. I need to waste huge amounts of energy to get it hot enough to work, and even then the result is still so-so.The warming tray is handy for keeping vegetables hot while the rest of the meal is cooked.The racks are hard to adjust, and I still haven't figured out how to use the ill-fitting pans and trays.In all, a disappointing purchase."
5,Surprized at the quality and service,"I was going to go with some of the better name brands, but liked the features of the Avante Elite. The machine was more than I could hope for.It is not a bulky size, and fits on the counter right next to my stove. The reason I bought this was to save money due to the way electricity power has gone up this year. I now use it as my main oven, since there is only two of us as retirees. I love to cook for my husband and so this oven is really a gem for me. The convection oven cooks very evenly and accurately for timing. Has several different pans for baking and broiling. I bought another for deep baking. All in all, I am so happy with this machine and would highly reccommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing a toaster oven. Best of all features. 6 toast ability, convection oven for speed and eveness and quick re heat or simply cooking."
5,Toaster Oven,"I just love the Avante Elite Convection Toaster Oven. I bought it to use at work instead of eating canned foods warmed in the microwave. I use it for baking meats including pork ribs and roast beef. I also make a frozen pizza in about 10 minutes. The toast is great, way better than a regular toaster. It cleans up easy and doesn't take up too much space."
5,Excellent convection oven,"I've had this oven for nearly a year now and love it! It bakes and broils quickly and evenly without having to preheat it, and the kitchen doesn't get over-heated. I hardly ever use my regular oven anymore so it has helped reduce my electric bill. It has a fairly large capacity and unless you're cooking a huge roast or turkey or a full size pizza, this is a great counter top oven for every day use."
4,T-Fal 0T8085002 Avanta Elite Convection Toaster Oven,"I like the oven very much except for the racks. They do not stay in the tracks when you are sliding the food out after cooking is complete thus could cause burns. Otherwise, it is efficient and keeps me from using the large oven and heating up the house."
2,don't bother,The wormer is wasted space. They should design the same unit smaller without the warmer and it would be excellent.
2,xxl ??? only model,ovbviously the godzilla of toaster ovens .... I did not expect it to be so big ... do they make a smaller size ... there seems to be another sku ... but ...I don't know !!
1,never came and never notified in time for Christmas,I can not judge the oven because I never recieved it. It was order in time for Christmas I used the tracking system but I was never notified. I finally call 12/23 and they said they were sorry but it won't make it in time. Thanks Amizon for letting me know. I will not order from Amizon again since they don't have the ability to deliver what they say they can.
5,amazon's product description,amazon.com describes the t-fal convection toaster oven as having a defrost on it which it does not.I bought this oven thinking it would have this defrost on it and found out it did not.Since it was their mistake I asked them to give me some kind of credit on my account to make it right and they did not respond to this idea.I think anybody considering buying anything from amazon.com may want to think again.With all the money they have and they make you would think they would have been willing to offer me some kind of credit on my account to make up for their mistake.I even offered to give them a good review if they did but they chose not to.Don't think I'll be buying from their website again.Unhappy with the service at amazon.com.
1,no help from customer service,I cannot and have not used this product that I paid $100.00 for. I was not given instructions with this product. I have called and left my e-mail address and physical address to have it sent. Nothing has happened and this is August now. It was purchased in June.
4,New to toaster/convection ovens,"I bought this oven to replace my microwave and toaster. The oven does seem to work well, easy to clean the crumb tray. The bowl and/or handle gets hot before the food does, unlike a microwave oven."
1,Good while it lasts,"I purchased this toaster oven in 2007, and I really liked the convection oven feature. It is very useful to bake small amounts of food instead of turning on the real oven. However, the toast cycle takes a long time. Now, after 3 and a half years, it just stopped working. It won't even turn on. Very disappointing."
4,exceptional taster oven,"This toaster oven serves my purposes very well. I find the warmer feature very useful, it toasts well (though a bit slowly), can accomodate a small chicken, and the crumb tray is much easier to clean than my previous one. The only downsides are that it takes uo a fair amount of space on the counter, and the glass covering over the warmer section clouds over and needs to be cleaned when the oven part is used."
2,Not the performance I expected,"This product bakes unevenly despite the convection fan,which is noisy, the toaster function is very slow and the lower settings barely warm the bread, the manual is confusing, skimpy and essentially useless. I haven't found a use for the warming compartment and would never attempt to cook eggs in it as suggested. The dimensions do not accept most frozen pizzas. It would be acceptable at $40, but not at this price. I am puzzled by the favorable reviews."
3,Zimbabwean Perspective,"This book fails to embrace and recognize new trends in the computer hardware industry in terms of future trends, the role of the internet and how it will have an infulence on any new developments"
5,Music Collectors,"For those who enjoy the listening ventures of electronica and/or world music, this album definitely meets the best of each music style. Though I am more prone to their more popular collections (my favorite of all time: Protection), it was a nice treat to hear Massive Attack create and collaborate with other interesting artists. For instance, the song 'Teardrop' was sung by the former lead singer for the Cocteau Twins; and there was another interesting track sung by Sinead O'Connor. Overall, this 'best of' album consisted of some massively cool stuff.In addition, the DVD portion was quite interesting. I wasn't expecting to see a strip tease (for 'Be Thankful For What You've Got') as part of this DVD collection; however, that video was done in somewhat good taste. As for the remaining videos, there was some cool digital and visual effects.Overall, I am glad I COLLECTED this CD as part of my music library!"
4,Massive Collection.,"The best of Massive Attack. A lot of fans have been waiting for this to come out, but is it as good as we hoped. The answer is yes. This two disc 'Best Of' album is quite rewarding. Tracing back to Massive Attack's successful years including some and most of their best songs. The only other album of Massive Attack that I really like is the excellent Mezzanine. It was dark, eerie and moody tuned which is what I was attracted to. Collected does deliver this dark and eerie music with the classic Karmacoma, the melodic but dark Angel, Teardrop, Inertia Creeps and Risingsun from Mezzanine. Collected does keep me happy with these well known tracks along with other past hits that are enjoyable and adapt towards my tastes. However, I was a little dissapointed that Man Next Door and Black Milk wasn't on this album as they are two very good Massive Attack songs both from the dark Mezzanine.Overall, this is a very pleasing collection from a great artistic band."
4,A good collection,"This is a good collection of Massive Attack. If you enjoy them, I think you'll enjoy this CD-DVD combo."
2,The 2nd Layer of DVD will not play in all machines.,"Watch out!The 2nd Layer of the DVD, which is the opposite side of the disc that holds only the new Audio tracks, will not play on all machines!I bought this thinking that there will be 2 discs and a DVD, but they put the 2nd disc on the back side of the DVD - and that layer will not play on my laptop.It was a real bummer - as I wanted to put it onto my MP3 player."
5,Massive Attack Collective Special Edition,"The special edition version of Massive Attack's ""Collected"" is a must have for any fan of this extraordinary group. The bonus songs and videos warrant any extra cost even if one already owns the single CD of ""Collected"". As a matter of fact, even if the special edition only contained the song ""Silent Spring"" featuring Elizabeth Fraser, it would still be worth it!"
5,"Well Rounded, and Supported by Modern Physics","This book is well written and covers both theory and practice. I read many books that pertain to consciousness, and I have found parallels between the concepts in this book and those in works such as ""Stalking the Wild Pendulum"" (Bentov), ""The Physics of Consciousness"" (Walker), and ""The Dimensional Structure of Consciousness"" (Avery). In addition to works of physics, support for these concepts can be found in Jungian Depth Psychology, especially Alchemical Studies. Also, there is a strong similarity between Qigong and Kundalini Yoga. Of course, Qigong and Yoga have been around much longer than depth psychology or modern physics. Read this book, as well as other books by Dr. Yang; you may even want to read ""The Root of Chinese Qigong"" before reading this book."
5,Love it!,This little thing gives you the great pleasure of coffee..You can count on the great smell in the process and then the flavor in your mouth!
1,Much better books out there,"We've bought other ...for dummies books before and have been quite happy. But this book was a huge disappointment. Maybe because the topic isn't easily handled in the typical ...for dummies format. Also, the author you can tell is used to writing computer manuals. The book is often preachy and rarely helpful. I definitely wouldn't recommend it."
2,Just ok,Ok book but didn't appear to be very interesting. I think I was looking for something a little different. A lot of this looked like common sense.
1,Terrible advice,"The authors of this book appear to have no credentials to write this book. Sure, parenting isn't rocket science but this book is filled with too much idiosyncratic advice from these two parents who I wouldn't want to emulate."
5,Does what it claims,"I tried these gloves out during a couple of recent snowy outings and they work very well. Insulated, yet close fitting enough to allow me to work the controls on my camera. I even was able to wear them under a pair of regular gloves to keep my hands warm until I was ready to use my camera."
5,"If you know how to write history, you know how good this is","As a graduate student of history, I know that you cannot possibly write about every aspect of anything (especially the Vietnam War) in a book. If one were to write about everything on the Vietnam War, there would be a library full of volumes. Wyatt has chosen to focus on one aspect, one that has been ignored so often (which is why the previous reviewer can only cite one public avenue - television). Many books have been written on the role of television. The challenge to historians is to find something new, and Wyatt does a beautiful job of it. The intricacies he finds within the paper media are amazing, and his analysis never fails.Wyatt is an incredible historian and an equally incredible man. I absolutely recommend this book."
5,A good way to get started,"I like this product because I actually learned the language just like it said in their commercials. You have to do exactly like they said to do or you will forget. It took me a few tries on disciplining myself to stick to their methods before I started to learn Japanese. Anyone who want to learn quickly and can spare at least 30 minutes a day, should give this method a try."
3,Japanese for Americans,"I've never been good at languages but had a need to learn. Pimsleur was a good option to pass the time usefully on my commute. I'm doing better than I feared. One big detraction though is sensibility of what I'm learning. Being English, spending the first four lessons learning 'you are Japanese' is ok, but 'I am American' just has me constantly wondering how to say ' I am English' and fighting subconsciously. Small point, big detraction. It should be called Japanese For Americans.Another minor issue is that occasionally the talking is too fast, and the pronunciation by man vs woman leaves me unsure of whether a word is 'masem' or 'masen'. All in all though, I'm fairly happy with it so far. The real test will be on my next trip!"
4,Beginning Japanese,A good way to start getting the language and some helpful phrases into your mouth and brain. Some discrepancy in the pronunciation of a couple sounds/words between the male and female speakers. Not clear if this is a recording issue or what.
2,Basic Japanese,"For those who are visual learners..... there are no visual communications. This could pose a problem. Although a good product, it does not cater to the visual learner. Everyone is not necessarily an auditory learner."
4,Basic Japanese,Shipping time was accurate. The item was in good condition. I haven't made great strides with it yet but can see where it might be a good option to traditional classes
5,"brief portraits of influential, memorable women","There's the familiar, expected, notable women--the flier Amelia Earhart, the black author Zora Neale Hurston, the artist Frida Kahlo, the philanthropist Eleanor Roosevelt. But there's also a number of accomplished lesser-known women and ones who have achieved recognition in recent years who are not yet seen as regulars in the circle of historically significant women. Thus, one finds the architect Maya Lin and the figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi. Outstanding women from diverse ethnic backgrounds and active in diverse fields, from labor unions to science to entertainment, are included in the twenty-six for each letter of the alphabet. Each woman is pictured in a collage-like illustration with objects representing what she is recognized for."
1,Great CD- terrbile sound,Recently picked up two copies of this CD from Amazon. The sound is awful on both copies- lots of crackling in the background. It almost sounds as if it were mastered from an poor quality record. This ain't exactly a hot seller- perhaps this is an old pressing that is a number of years old. Stay away from Amazon's inventory. Another retailer's inventory or an import pressing might be better.
1,Only for Cayce fans.,"This book does not reveal anything about Edgar Cayce that wasn't previously known so Cayce fans won't find anything new in it and those who arn't into Cayce won't find it of interest. The book is published by ARE Press, the outfit that publishes all the Cayce material, so what else would it be about. There are better Cayce books and much better 'life after death' books around."
3,"Not overly impressed - overprocessed, redundant and and fairly uninspired","I listen to a lot of prog and have for over 20 years. This CD was in my car player for abour 3 months and I have probably listened to it over 20 times. The first thing that I noticed was that the vocals and lead guitar are heavily overprocessed with gobs and gobs of ""chorus"" effect - and not always tastefully so. It is applied liberally to everything on every song. Bands that overprocess generally are trying to compensate for something. The main theme of the album is just ok, and it gets repeated until you think you are just hearing the same song over and over. The songwriting and composition of the music to me seems uninspired and often appears forced with deliberate complexity that just doesn't flow naturally. It's good prog rock but not the sort of thing I will have in my favorites list or listen to again down the road."
5,A Nice Listen,"I like this, quite a bit actually. Very well- written, executed, balance of quiet and powerful. Reminds me somewhat of the Flower Kings without some of the extended musical forrays (which some I enjoy!) Also there is a hint of 90's era King Crimson: the quiet, arpeggiated guitar lines. There are no keys, which can be a good thing. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big sucker for melotron music, but sometimes I feel songs can become quite cluttered by an over- ambitious keyboard player. The guitar is pretty basic, but effective and the songs are well- constructed, with interesting lyrics (no drivel) and plenty of time signature changes to keep things interesting. Nice vocals and harmonies (a hint of older Yes.) I like a recording that leaves me with a good feeling and this one certainly does!"
1,Doesn't do ish,"If somehow the world ran out of peanut butter, I'd use rolled oats before I'd use this. Hell I'd use ice cubes, I'd use dirt. It does nothing."
2,Not Better Than PB & Potentially Poison,"Putting a drop of gel in a trap looked less messy than peanut butter, so I thought I'd give it a try. It did seem to attract mice, although no better than PB and I also noticed that 2 of the 3 mice I caught with the gel died, and the one did survive look sick when I released him. I don't know if the gel is toxic, or if they just aren't as 'filled up"" and can't tolerate waiting in the trap until morning, but either way it I decided to stop using it. If I wanted to kill them, I'd use the less expensive and more humane snappy traps, not the 'Live Catch"" traps."
2,Mouse attractant.,"Peanut butter worked better.So far, it has yet to attract a single mouse. I would not buy this product again."
5,action-packed thriller!!,Loved book. Great plot. Interesting characters.Look forward.to reading more books by this author.Thank you for a great read!!
5,One of my favorite books of all time!,"Yes, Rat rocks. Skyles is excellent too. This book has two trials going on simultaneously...with covert actions going on overseas, in between some high-tension court-hearings. It's just a roller coaster ride kind of story. Hard to put down even for a few minutes. I've read 5 of Huston's 8 books, and will continue on until I am done with his collection. He is a very good writer. This book though, with so much going on just grabbed at me page after page. My hat's off to the author for having such imagination, and further...the mental stamina to tell such a complex story, and keep it so exciting without losing the readers interest ever. I like that the story stays strong and with the same energy as the book starts out with, all the way to the end. James. W. Huston rescued me from ""I can't find a good author"" blues.I purchased this book from Amazon for use on the ""Kindle for Android"" and ""Kindle on PC"" (a free download from Amazon to your phone or PC)"
5,Helpful,"This book, though written in a very simplistic manner, is a useful guide for those unfamiliar with the teachings of the Bible."
2,"Okay for Christians, but other readers might find too much evangelizing","Every book has its intended audience, and secular humanists are NOT the intended audience of this book. If you are interested in the Bible as a historical/cultural document, you would do well to seek out other sources.Early on, this book begins to make the case for reading the Bible to be close to God, and presses the case by arguing that societies (such as the contemporary U.S.) with low or patchy readership, are not ""hungry for God"". On a few occasions, the book professes to be a resource for non-Christians, but I think there are other texts (like the Dummies book or the notes in the Oxford Scholar's Bible) that would better serve an audience truly not looking for a religious experience."
3,Too much proselytizing,"I would have given this a 4 star rating (losing one star for being too cute for my taste). Each title heading is a pun of some sort, and some of that continues in the text.The big problem I had though was that he could say (I am paraphrasing), ""I am not trying to convert anyone and it is fine if you want to believe that random evolution led to man."" The pope too made similar comment today about ""random evolution.""All this demonstrates is a complete lack of knowledge about evolution, as it is anything but ""random.""A few more of similar remarks proposing false dichotomies in an effort at conversion led to the loss of another star.On the other hand, for the most part it appeared to present a fairly good, concise, rundown of the Bible that I found useful.However, from what of I have read so far in the ""Dummies Guide to the Bible"" I think ""Dummies"" is a better option."
1,Very Unhappy,"I was very disappointed in it. The pericope sections are just restatements with very simplistic explanations. It didn't open up the Bible for me in any way and I can't imagine making my Sunday School class suffer through it. I recommend The Complete Idiot's Guide Bible Study for Teens -- it is much more interesting and has more information to help open up the Bible. And you don't have to be a teen. I bought this version because I couldn't imagine having adults use a teen book. But the teen book is much more interesting, with so much more information. Good luck in your search for helpful Bible resources. I'd honestly skip this one, though."
2,A Fanciful History of the Bible,"If Campbell and Bell are to be believed then no important eventin the history of the Bible came until after theReformation. Comically, these authors can only refer to the Catholic Church as the ""important people"" when assigning it credit for deciding which books belonged in the Bible; although, Bell and Campbell are able to mention the Catholic Church by name when accusing it of adding books to the Bible at the Council of Trent. The Catholic Church did not add books at Trent and only reaffirmed their rightful place in Sacred Scripture.Campbell and Bell also error in claiming that the Roman Catholic Church broke away from the Orthodox Church. This is incorrect, and any dummy can easily reference the far wittier ""Complete Idiot's Guide to Biblical Mysteries"" in the same series to discover that the reverse is true.Bell and Campbell state in the foreward that they have written without bias. I will not make such claims."
3,"Well written, but only part of the story","There is a serious division within Christianity between conservatives and liberals. This book does an excellent job describing the conservative position in terms that are easy for the public to understand. But, there is also a need for a simlar book written from the liberal position, in order that the public can understand the full diversity of Christian religious expression. Bishop Spong's books ""Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism"" or ""Liberating the Gospels"" represent a good balance to this book"
3,The Complete Idiots Guide to the Bible,I have not had a lot of timeto review...but I like what if have read!Where is my last order...my check has still not cleared the bank. Thanks!
4,enjoyable reading,I am enjoying reading the authors version of the Bible instead of reading the Bible or hearing it from my pastor.
4,Good read,"Read the original Bible always but, this makes a good second source if you have basic questions and are not inclined to find scholarly books."
4,Click Here for A Great Computer...,"""Click Here for Murder"" is Donna Andrews' second novel, which features Turing Hopper...who is a computer. Well, not JUST a computer, but an AIP (Artificial Intelligence Personality), who solves crimes.When Ray Santiago is murdered and his laptop disappears, Maude, Tim, and Turing are frantic. Not only are they grieving over the death of their newest member, but apprehensively they must discover how much information has been revealed. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they begin to discover that their co-worker had a few mysteries of his own.Although I enjoyed the first book, ""You've Got Murder,"" a little more - I really thought that Claudia was a great addition. However, the dual personality with Turing was a little creepy. Overall, I think that most readers would like this series, however."
4,better yet,"i thought the first book was good but ""click here for murder"" is clearly better. I look forward to ""access denied"".Special thanks to Miss Andrews. Edward Lorentson"
4,Essential guide for any actor,This book includes some of the best monolouges from the worlds newest and bravest playwrights. Authors such as Tony Kushner and Emily Mann along with many others contribute speeches from thier harrowing and award-winning plays of the last ten years. Definatly a must-buy for anyone looking for an oringial and unique monolouge.
2,Hot Ice,The cast of charicters were too dispictable to develep any empathy by the reader. I think it must have been written early in her career.
2,Glad I didn't buy it...,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, but this one is terrible. I'm glad I read the copy from my local e-library. Definitely wouldn't pay for this book. I almost returned it without finishing. It dragged on and wasn't what I would expect from a Nora Roberts book."
1,Hated Whitney MacAllister,"This is one of Nora Roberts worst book. I got about half way through the book and couldn't finish it. I hated Whitney MacAllister, I wanted someone to gag her, tie her up and leave her stranded somewhere. She was so annoying. I couldn't stand her.I've read a lot of Nora Roberts books and I've tried picking this one up but I can't stand the female lead. She overshadows everything in the book. I wanted the guy to throw her from a moving car. I don't know how anyone put up with her in the book. My mom read the book and liked it. I hated it completely."
2,Disappointing.,"I thought this was a new book by Nora Roberts. But it is old. The first half was so dull I almost didn't finish it. The second half was better, but still could read a few pages and put it down. That usually doesn't happen with Nora Roberts books. Would not recommend it."
4,very pleased,The book came in a timely manner and was in excellent condition. Tthe only reason for the loss of one star is because the description stated that it was a paperback and I was sent a hardcover. They are a little bit heavy in the purse...
3,worth while read,"i enjoyed this book tremendously. Many reviewers have said that this wasn't Nora Roberts best effort & i agree with this, but having said this it's still a very enjoyable book & i wouldn't miss it. It reminisces Romancing The Stone (the movie) a great deal. I thought the plot carried on well and the banter between H/H was witty, there was alot of excitement throughout the story, and the romance was definitely there so am a bit suprised that some readers didnt think there was alot of romance?? i liked the neat ending & it definitely wrapped up everything nicely. It's worth spending the $$ to buy the book. I definitely recommend this book."
4,A Great Read,"""Hot Ice"" is a vintage Nora Roberts (cc 1987) but it is still a great romantic suspense novel. The rich heroine is ""kidnapped"" by the jewel thief and off they go on a treasure hunt. To add spice to the plot, on their heels is the evil Dimitri. I really enjoyed this novel."
4,A great book that makes you laugh and have you in suspense.,"Hot Ice-an adventurous, romantic, comedy that had me staying up all night to read. Nora Roberts wrote great romantic scenes like her other book Sancturary. Hot Ice made me laugh out loud many times because of the many sarcastic remarks. Hot Ice is definetly a page-turner that made me want to order more of her books!"
3,My findings,"The story moved well. There was not a great deal of suspense that wasn't ascertained near to or prior to the event described. The ending was well done, although I didn't find any logical explanation for the rescurers sudden appearance on the scene."
3,Not one of the best...,"This book is not one of Nora's better books. It gets a little dull and is not one I would read again. It is probably my least favorite of all her books. But even being her worse book, it's still better than a lot of other romance books."
1,Awful,"This is probably the worst Nora Roberts book I've ever read in my life. It comes close to being the worst, period.Whitney is totally unlikeable and ruins the story. She's annoying, arrogant, selfish and spoiled, from writing down every cent she gives Doug to the use of the formal ""Douglas"" whenever she speaks to him (his constant use of ""sugar"" isn't much better). It seems like every time they turn around, someone is on their tail, no matter where they go or what they do...totally unrealistic. And most of the book consists of them evading capture, rather than doing anything worthwhile.If this had been my first Nora Roberts book, I never would've read another. As it is, the only reason I finished it is because I had no other books in the house."
3,It's OK,The plot is simple but some of the 'scenes' made me laugh. If you're the type who likes to read about men and women arguing first before falling in love..then you'll like this. Reading this encouraged me to read more of NR's books!
2,I'll pass,"Of all the books by Nora Roberts, this one (and maybe one more) are the worst! I could barely finish it! Please, don't write another like it!"
2,Good but not one that grabbed me like most of Nora Roberts books,"I have read almost all of Nora Roberts books and I love them. I was a little disappointed in this book. I usually am hooked by the 30th page in all of her books. This book did not do that for me, it was fairly good but it was one I could put down and go back to with no urgency. I love the myths and witchcraft of her other books and I love all of the trilogy's. This one just didn't strike me as real and they found the treasure too easy. Going to reread the Key trilogy that was absolutely great."
1,Surprisingly Disappointed!,"I LOVE Nora Roberts and have read (and mostly kept) all of her books. I usually devour a Nora Roberts book within a day or so. I could NOT get into this story at all! It did not keep my attention or enthusasum at all....kept trying to read it, stopped frequently...came back to it a day later and eventually I skipped pages (not something I normally do) and toward the middle to end I just couldn't take it anymore. I skipped more, got the just and gave up. That is something that I've NEVER done with a Nora Roberts book before or since."
3,"Exciting, but sometimes irritating","I've have read some of Ms. Roberts work and I have enjoyed them. This one. I want to ring the heroine's neck at times. Whitney is a spoiled little brat. I really like Doug. He's rugged, strong and down to earth. I don't know what he sees in Whitney. She's constantly writing down his charges in her little account book. I would have ditched her the first opportunity that I had. Killers or no killers. She just rubs me the wrong way. Everything has to be her way. 85$ for a pair of pants. Come on. I would not bring a 85$ worth of pants into a rain forest or out walking. No, I would like a better character than Miss Priss. Doug I would take any day."
3,"A good choice, if it will fit your tub.","This product may not work if the sides of your tub are curved, sculpted, or sloped. The walls of my parent's tub turned out to be more sloped and curved than I had remembered while ordering this item. As a result, I stripped one of the bolts while trying to get the clamp to conform to the rather slight curvature and slope of the tub wall. I realize that this limitation probably appears to be obvious to the reader, given the type of clamp involved, but then again I have never seen a bathtub with inner side surfaces that are all flat and perpendicular to the floor (box-like.). I am now stuck with a useless piece of junk, but it is my fault for failing to employ my common sense when ordering this item."
5,Great DVD,I love to see a musician who gets better with age. This is an excellent DVD. It contains many good songs. My favorite is Harbor Lights.
5,Boz Scaggs Live At The Great American Music Hall - San Francisco,"I first saw the video on HD Net. The Quality of this production is incredible! The Venue is gorgeous! The Sound is astounding! There is only one problem here, I wasn't in the crowd hearing this wonderful concert! My God, I would have given almost anything to have been there! I bought the DVD and the CD for my car. I even purchased another DVD and sent it to a close friend of mine. Boz Scaggs has always been a favorite of mine over the years (I'm 63 now). His rendition of ""Miss Sun"" with backup-singer Monet is truly incredible! Boz never seemed to get the top billing or should I say SuperStar status. He has always been my SuperStar! Boz Scaggs is truly ""The Man""!"
5,Amazing DVD--Amazing artist--Amazing band!,"So many reviews have been written here so I'll keep it short.This is one of the very best concerts I have ever seen recorded. Everything that has to do with producing something is perfected on this disc. The music, the sound, the photography, the band, the writing, the vocalists --- you name it and it's wonderful! It's a non-stop watch!I love the whole thing but ""Look What You've Done To Me"" and ""Heart of Mine"" absolutely tear me up!If you are a musician of ANY level, you must see this and internalize it! It is a great lesson in musicianship!"
4,Boz Still Got It,"It took me a year to track down this DVD from sold out sources and it was entirely worth the wait. Boz still sounds good, along with his band and backups. Although, it is not a Blu-ray, the picture quality is better than some Blu-rays concerts that I have. Surround mixes sound great with a live presence that is great. The only drawback of the disc, is that it is a little on the dark side but well worth the price of admission."
1,Worthless,"I bought this book after reading the definitive text on blood sugar, The New Glucose Revolution, and I almost chucked this in the trash. The author actually says ""any diet"" is good for preventing diabetes - low carb, or low fat, or low glycemic or anything else. All you need to do is find ""one that works for you."" Following that advice, many people may do themselves harm. Not all diets are the same, and someone trying to avoid diabetes needs to eat those foods that will specifically not spike their blood sugar - namely low-glycemic foods. After all the hype about this book, it was truly a disappointment, full of quaint, over simplified, and misinformed advice."
4,Nice & Jumpy Tunes,"This is my first gospel reggae CD in a great while. It's a great listen, even if only 12 tracks. I guess enough to bait you to purchase other volumes. Only the variety is a little skimpy, most of these volumes have multiple songs by the same artist, and don't feature current gospel reggae artists, like Sherwin Gardner or Papa San. Otherwise a good listen for the price."
3,Wrong picture!!! Warning Will Robinson.,"Buyer bewareThis is not the set of 3 Trade Federation droid fighters. It's the cast metal one. See the one customer image. However, for[...] the scale is pretty good and it's certainly durable. It may not walk well, but then again neither does the detachable plastic one seen on the outside of the box.[...]"
4,"Easy, approachable. Good for discussion groups.","The ""young couple's"" group at our church has been using this book as a discussion guide at our monthly meetings. It's been very popular with the group. Unlike some other books we've used, you don't need a dictionary to understand any of the words. It's down-to-earth, with good ideas."
5,Happy!,"Hare and Guu will make you smile! A wonderfully random anime that kept me laughing. Hare, who liven in the jungle with his Mother, now has a new roomate that never ceases to baffle him. One minuit she is a charming charismatic girl, then next she puts on a moody, somewhat frightining face and is eating everything from the T.V. to his bird/best friend Hee. Poor Hare has to try and figure out whats going on with his new roomie before she eats him as well! This anime is perfect if you need something that will entertain a large group of people with diffrent tastes in anime, because if there is one thing that everyone can agree on, its comedy!"
3,decent title,"A really odd one. Though this show is cute which I liked, the comedy in it was not really in my alley. I'm gonna try the next volume though."
5,A superb cd,"This is the second disc (the first was ""Who shot the Viola Player"") I buy from Triology, and I must say it's one of my favorites titles. This it's a disc you can hear all day long, without getting bored."
5,new CD,"try Triology's new CD, out in Austria and soon in the US. It's fantastic, and includes their own compositions.'Who killed the viola player ?'If you can't get hold of it, contact BMG, their record company."
4,Group class book,"I like this book but is not a self study, due its function is communication skill, you need to work in a classroom otherwise could be boring, the lessons are driven to chat in a group and make the lesson iteractives.Good luck."
4,Nemo Toy,This toy isn't for educational value but my grandson loves Finding Nemo so this toy was a huge hit. All of the main ones are in this package. He knows them all by name. He plays with them & sometimes takes one or two of them to bed with him. I love it because he is so into them.
4,"""I can't stop my feet!""","Great to hear some old geezers (okay, they're not that old, but by today's music industry standards, they oughta be doin' the reunion thing by now) makin' some fine music. The Tractors know what they like, and they do as well as anyone. Stick to your roots, fellas!"
5,They're Simply Brilliant,"This like their others is magic.Shortenin' Bread, Poor Boy Shuffle - just love them. I wish they would find time to visit downunder - its a great country and I for one would welcome them with open arms. Steve Ripleys voice just blows me away. I have just bought his solo CD and it too is brilliant. How do I get hold of Chicken Covers an album of kids songs?"
3,"Sounding like 4 years never passed,","If you loved their first album, you'll probably like this one too. For me, tho, all the music had much the same sound, with little varience in rhythms. But then, if you consider The Tractors kinda fill their own little niche, that could be a good thing."
2,Copy of their first CD,"Of course the songs are not exactly the same, but this is an exact copyof their wonderful ""the Tractors"" CD that every music lover should own.Therefore there's nothing new about this and at the and it's sorepetitive that it hurts the ears and I must admit I even couldn'tfinish listening to it. I love honky tonk but not the ""same"" song 9times in a row. The remaining one sure is a nice ballad and the onlyhighlight."
3,Two and a half stars...,"...would have been about right. An intriguing premise, but not fully realized. I think my main problem with the book was with the characterizations. They really didn't ring quite true. Five year old Vivian was unbelievably precocious, new wife Antoinette unbelievably unlikable, lover Odessa unbelievably noble, etc. etc. John Washington, the focus of the novel almost seemed cardboard. It was hard to care one way or the other what happened to him. The ending was also a disappointment. Suddenly the book just ended. The ""minor"" characters that we followed through the book were suddenly disposed of one by one in a few lines apiece while John and Odessa were granted a couple of unsatisfying pages. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a terrible book. I just didn't think it lived up to what it could have been.(By the way, for anyone concerned about profanity, there was no shortage of it in this book.)"
4,Makes you want to think...,"Personally, I had to read this book for an ENglish class that I needed to graduate with. A friend in telling me about the book implied that the guy was a selfish so and so, and when I read it, I felt that Mersault just didn't care one way or the other what he wanted.Just because he didn't cry at his own mother's funeral, they handed him a harsh sentence?? No previous crimes, no rap sheet, alright, he took a life, one life that didn't have nothing to do with him except for his friend making him do it. Let's look at this. The guy had no goals, no ambitions, no nothing. He has a girl, but it don't mean a thing to him one way or the other. Does that make him amoral?? I feel it makes him irresponsible,unfeeling 5f0 , and aimless."
2,Do yourself a favor and skip it!!!,"To call this book a Marxist rant would be an understatement. Davis spends over 400 pages verbally demolishing a great city. I've lived here my entire life and I could not imagine living anywhere else. Nothing escapes his wrath. He engages in the same tiring class warfare arguments all Marxists value; Rich against poor, black and latino against white, religion against secularization. Everyone who has a position of power in Los Angeles is raked across the coals. Never mind that he does not provide any of his own solutions for the supposed problems of our city. If you are looking for a balanced well-argued book do not look here, but if you are looking to read a leftest diatribe you'll feel perfectly at home."
3,A Marxist perspective on a capitalist playground,"Mike Davis bludgeons his readers with incessant blows of data to support his thesis: ""Capitalism has crashed--we're just waiting for reality to reflect our perception of it."" Davis's critique of free-market culture obscures his scholarship and reporting of Los Angeles's omens. He makes his impression: the reader says, ""Yuck!"" to all that self-centered capitalism."
1,More Marxist Trash,"Thanks you MbuArtRnch@aol.com for exposing the truth. In my unfortunate days in the past as a leftist (I've recanted, thank God!), I heard Mr. Davis speak at, get this, a Trotskyite meeting of his peers. Don't read Marxist trash like this! Free your minds and do a body-bag count of the Communist/Socialist legacy!"
1,Forgettable,"As a student of urban development and politics, I can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind. Davis offers a hardline Marxist view of Los Angeles that, by employing only simple and misguided economic analysis, does not allow for the intricacies of the city's problems. Class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of Los Angeles -- anyone outside of the ISO should be discouraged from reading this baseless piece of propoganda."
5,Great Close Up Lens Set,"I'm really enjoying using these. My pictures with them are plenty sharp. I've been shooting outside, hand-held, and enjoy the convenience of not using a tripod."
5,Need to get close-up? Get this!,"For really close detailed shots of plants, flowers, equipment, jewellery, this set of lenses is incredible!"
2,Not so great,I bought these to help with my macro scale photography for a Canon 7D with the 15-85mm lens. The lower end 1-2 magnification really have very little effect - you can tell this simply by holding it up and looking through it as you would a magnifying glass. The 4x lens has better magnification but the camera just couldn't focus through it at all so I ended up returning these. Thanks Amazon.
3,It's OK,"Early on in my photography I thought these were cool so I purchased them. After playing around with them for about 15 minutes I really wasn't happy with what you could do with these. I guess if you did a lot of macro photography you may find these helpful. I decided to keep them around to see if I'll find use for them, but I have pulled them out since the day they arrived."
1,WHAT IS THIS AMAZON?,"I'm confused by these reviews. Amazon, what's going on? Am I wrong or does Amazon have to pay more attention to these reviews?I googled ""close-up attachments"" and went into amazon. No, I did not want a warming filter, polarizer and UV wrapped into a 3 filter package deal. I wanted information on the close-up attachments that usually come numbered 1, 2 and 3, indicating each filters relative close-up focusing capabilities.These reviews are a mixture of the above.Pay attention Amazon. And stop profiling my interests and saturating me with offers on items that you are certain I will like.....all the while trying to make the automation look personal. Do you people really believe that we consumers are that stupid? If all that selling is what pays for amazon..........you can have it folks."
4,"Good, but not great","For your basic, entry-level creative photography, these are a great buy. I'm an amateur and these work great for me. There are irregularities that form around the edges of your photos if you go too crazy (stacking all three together for a photo for example) but for the price, they're great fun."
4,Great tool for creativity,"I shoot HD video with a Canon 60D, and I often do weddings. I'd had fun with closeup filters in my deep dark past, and wanted to try again. Last Sunday I shot a wedding at a resort, and the opening sequence was shot in the bridal suite where she did finishing touches on her gown, hair and makeup. I started with the #2 (medium) closeup filter on Canon's 50mm 1.4, and got several extreme closeups... flowers, details of the gown, champagne bottles, makeup containers, etc. Then switched to the #1 filter (less magnification) for tight closeups of her face as she did makeup. Then - bang - removed the closeup filter and cut to a full body shot of her in the dress, holding her bouquet. Very effective. My only comment is that the #3 filter is so powerful I haven't found a use for it yet... but it's nice to know I've got room to move."
4,Tiffen Filters.,Tiffen are renound for making excellent filters and this set meets the expectations. I would recommend this product but was just unlucky with my purchase as the size was incorrect for Nikon DSLR lenses so I had to return the item.
4,Nice text.,"I used these particular books when I was in high school spanish. They're pretty easy to get through, explain things clearly and are well organized.I bought them to not only refresh myself on spanish but to help homeschool my own daughter with them.She's not quite up to the reading level in them yet but we bought 1-2-3 of the series to get her started learning various verbs and things like colors, numbers, etc. I do wish it was easier to get ahold of the cds we used in school though!"
1,real sleeper,"I listened to portions of the songs ahead of time, thought I would like the CD. Don't listen to the CD while driving, it will put you to sleep. I guess I should listen to it at bedtime since I am stuck with it."
3,"Neil Diamond ""As Time Goes By: The Movie Album","His voice is as gorgeous as always, but the tempo drags on nearly every song. Some things should just be left to Sinatra ..."
3,Great choice of tunes;Wonderful arrangements;Clumsy vocals,"Elmer Bernstein's arrangements and conducting would do any singer proud,and the selection of songs can hardly be questioned. The artist, however, might have studied the phrasing of Frank Sinatra or Vic Damone. I found that Neil's approach was a tad strident."
4,Just another terrific side of Neil Diamond!,"Having just seen his latest concert in early December, we were amazed at how effective he was in introducing three of the songs from this album. They blended in with all of his old standards and proved, once again, why he always near the top. He respects his audience, has fun with them, and never ""just mails it in"" when entertaining. Why wouldn't he be a sell out for 30 years and this album, though different, is just another side of why he is a master showman."
2,SCHLOCK ON TWO CDS,"I bought this for one reason--the song ""As Time Goes By"" to use in my parents' 50th anniversary video. I ended up giving it away to anyone who would take it. What a bunch of smarmy songs! Neil Diamond sells out! He should have retired, because his old stuff is just as fresh and wonderful as it was 30 years ago (well, except maybe for ""Song Sung Blue,"" ""Stones,"" and ""I Am...I Said""--all real groaners. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the man--just not this horrible collection of junk. Sorry, I can't recommend this in any form."
2,like Neils traditional songs better.,"Tempo is to slow for most of the songs on this album. I am a Neil Diamond fan and I love most of his music. I am not saying these are not good songs, but not for Neil."
3,Somethings missing,"First of all,I always enjoyed Neil Diamond's music,""Sweet Caroline,Love on the rocks,Hello again,"" and my favorite,I AM..I Said,"" but this collection of Movie Theme songs sung by Neil just doesn't get it.The Orchestra,Conducted by Elmer Bernstein,is fantastic,but some of the numbers,Puttin' On the Ritz,The Way you look tonight,"" and my all time favorite Frank Sinatra Classic,""I've got you under my Skin,"" sounds like your sitting in a funeral home.These songs were written for a singer to put alittle kick into them,not depressing numbers like the way they sound on this double CD. I did enjoy,""When you wish upon a Star,As time goes by,""and ""The Windmills of your mind,"" but the rest of the music almost put me to sleep,and I was driving my car .If you like Neil Diamond's voice,mayby you will enjoy the record.I'd rather listen to Neil's classic's myself."
1,What happened to him???,"This is not the Neil Diamond whom I have known and loved for years. There is no feeling in this music. Neil usually belts his songs out filled with emotion and electricity - even his slower songs. Not so with this collection. I was so excited when I bought this cd I opened it right up and listened to it but the music was dead, none of that usual Diamond pizzaz. The concept of the collection was great - in fact if Neil was to do it over and sing the songs with some heart I'd buy it again. He potentially could have made this one of his best collections if he'd sung the way he usually does. I thought I'd find a use for it during a candle light dinner with my husband but it was so dull I found it distracting."
1,No No Neil,"Neil Diamond is a classic writer and singer of his own songs. He rarely misses with that combination and has produced some of the best work of the 70s,80s and 90s. However, like ""Songs from the Bril Building"" these are not his works, and he simply is not good doing them. Fans will no doubt buy it, but we have had no new written output in a while - Tennessee Moon - being the last. Since his divorce we have had live albums, several greatest hits packages recycling what most fans already have and this. IT is technically good, well produced, just dull music by numbers. It is maximum output with minimum effor and a far cry from ""Moon"". If you want to hear a singer with an orchestra who does hit the note, try Linda Rondstadt's albums with Nelson riddle. Neil can do better, so why do this ? Write a new album and hit us with it, that is what the fans really want."
2,Rip-off,"I'm not going to critique the music, that's totally subjective. I happen to like about 8 of the songs a lot and the others are so-so. Just my opinion, others will differ. In general, I like Neil Diamond's music a lot. Prospective buyers should know, however, that the price of this 33 minutes-per-CD set is a rip-off. That's right, there's only a total of 66 minutes of music, and therefore, no excuse to put the music on 2 CDs and charge a double-CD price. Columbia Records was obviously out to fool the brick-and-mortar buyer who hadn't read online reviews."
1,Ouch. It hurts to listen to.,"Okay, I admit, I don't own this album, but a good friend of mine does, and let me tell you this, it is the worst, I repeat, THE WORST album I have ever heard. He slaughters classic songs and makes money on it. Just because he is ""Neil Diamond"" does not mean that everything he does is good. He hits about two notes this whole album and even those aren't hit well. He creates no dramatic quality that I believe he was going for. His boring tone in these songs give it a long, drawn out quality. Ever heard LeAnn Rimes sing ""I'm So Lonesome, I Could Cry""? Yeah, its worse than that. It is a creative flop and should never have been recorded."
2,Not durable enough for a classroom,I found the product to be cheaply constructed and a little weak on the content side. I'm amazed that the prior reviewer gave it such high marks while at the same time explaining how he had to modify it in multiple places to make it durable. I'm not sure I would recommend this product for a classroom.
1,I live in Canada: this is utter BS,"America: Don't believe the hype.While no nation has a perfect healthcare system, the one we have here works a LOT better than the one you have there and we don't pay through nealry as much for it.Nobody in Canada is turned away from a hospital because an HMO said ""no"" and nobody in Canada is denied care because of a ""pre-existing condition.""My last hospital stay cost NOTHING. No deductible. No fee. No premium to an insurance company.This is propaganda made by insurance companies & HMO's that want your money for services that people in other counties all over the world do not have to pay for.If you honestly believe that this movie was made by an impartial filmaker to ""educate"" you about the ""dangers"" of public healthcare then I have a lovely Brooklyn bridge for sale."
5,The best book on 8 Ball PERIOD!!!,"Probably about 95% of people that play 8 Ball do not understand how to play the game. This book will show you. What the book does is change you way you think as you play the game....and that's powerful. If you're a league player...buy this book. If play serious 8 ball....buy this book. I buy 10-15 books a year and will only leave reviews on 1 or 2 of those books....this is one of them.Another worthy mention is the 8 Ball Bible. Might not go into quite the depth as Phil's book, but a good read and worth the money as well."
3,Initial look: editing is rough,I am just starting to read the book. There are several mistakes: referring to a diagram in the appendix that was not there; explaining a diagram but the words do not match the diagram. also the binding is not solid.Will comment later on book content after I go complete reading the book
4,Historic Southern Pacific Cars,"Note there are TWO (2) books from the same author with this name. The first features a staple-bound wraps cover (see photos above) and contains 52-pages with b&w; images of Southern Pacific & Cotton Belt freight cars, passenger cars, gas-electrics, Interurban passenger cars, and miscellaneous equipment.The other version is stapled but also perfect-bound (see photo above), where the wraps cover is glued at the spine, therefore the book appears thicker. This edition also contains 52-pages. Some images are repeated between the two books, but there are plenty of different images to make acquiring both editions worthwhile. When buying yours from a dealer, make sure to inquire as to which version they are selling."
1,Waste of Talent,"I'm a huge Sam Elliott fan. I can forgive a lot in weak production, as is often the case with some of his films. But this was really horrible. Every stupid cliche of American action films imaginable. I couldn't even make it to the end."
1,JUMPS THE SHARK BIG TIME,"I had hopes for this one. I thought it would be a surprisingly good movie like Road House. At the scene that takes place at the New Amsterdam Theater, this thing goes way wrong and way hokey. It's a waste of Sam Elliot. You think it's going to be a crusader guy movie but it turns into a preposterous shoot'em up with Sam Elliot swinging from a lamp post shooting with a Glock in one hand. It would have been OK that all of the characters are weak stereotypes, but the stupid gun fights and unbelievable car chases ruin this movie. Lazy writers are the downfall of many movies. It's so bad that it's NOT good. I've heard better dialogue between two teen aged girls on their cell phones. I couldn't make it to the end of this worthless, dumbed-down piece of idiocy."
3,Cuts???,"I swear when I saw this in the cinema there was areally hot sex scene between Weller and Charbonneau, but it's been completely cut in the DVD. ..."
3,Stunt-filled 80's action film!,"Another winner from underrated action director James Glickenhaus. Peter Weller and Sam Elliott star as a public defender and undercover cop who team up to take down a ring of dirty cops and a drug kingpin played by Antonio Fargas. Very well written, but the dialogue comes second to the action sequences, which are great. The best are a footchase through Coney Island that leads to a fistfight on a moving rollercoaster and a motorcycle/police car chase through Times Square. The stuntmen really have their work cut out for them in this one."
4,DUKE,"This is a very well conceived guide. Duke is blessed with a gorgeous campus and beautiful buildings. The university is known for its Gothic architecture, but it has other distinguished buildings in varied styles. It was interesting to know that one of the major early architects was African American, it just goes to show you how obtuse stereotypes can be..and I am talking about the unfair stereotype of Duke."
3,"Cooks well, but lid does not close properly after sev. uses","Bought my fryer in July, plastic clip on basket handle broke the moment I took it out of the box. As it was still usable, I decided not to return it. After several uses, found that the lid closes well initially but after 1-2 batches of cooking, the lid frequently pops open unexpectedly. This despite me wiping away any moisture/oil on the inner side of the lid and using new oil. I have to hold the lid down for the duration of the cooking. Otherwise the fryer cooks well."
2,"cooks great, lid does not work well...","I Love the way the Tefal deep fryer cooks, however, I am returning my second one due to a defective lid closure. The lid may close initially, but after a few uses it no longer stays closed. Since I have small children in my home, I will not be purchasing this one again."
1,Lid never closed,I got this one as a present. I was never able to close the lid. I had to put heave items on the lid to keep it shut. It broke right away. After using it for 3 times it went into the trash. Couldn't return it since I didn't have the receipt. Too bad. Looking for a different brand now.
2,NOT dishwasher safe,"I've owned this unit for just over a year. It fried fine and there was some problems I overlooked. When I closed the top, steam would stream out the top of it throught the filter. My whole house and I smelled like oil whenever it was on. Even after putting a new filter in. Also, the unit overflowed on me. I should have replaced the oil sooner. However, when I wiped off the outside with Softscrub, along with the oil, the writing on the body came off. Also, the timer stopped working after the overflow. I chalked this up to learning experience. Recently I moved, and now have a dishwasher. The first and last time I put the dishwasher-safe tub into the dishwasher, the non-stick coating peeled off. I called T-fal, and the unit is only warrantied for a year. I think that's pretty crappy customer service."
4,Avante Deep Fryer -- Great product!,"This product is easy to use and cleans up very easy, the basket goes into the dish washer and comes out clean!! I would highly recommend it."
2,recentbuyer,"The very first time I changed the oil in this fryer--after four or five uses--the teflon coating on the oil basket was already beginning to flake away. I suspect it will get worse and quickly. The machine is very nice-looking, but buyer beware!"
1,tefal doesnot stand behind their products,Tefoln inside peeled and floated all around the food. would not recommed this item. Tefal would not replace it
1,this thing stinks bad!,bought this thing on clearance for 30 dollars and used it 2 times after that the lid would not stay shut and was always opening in the midst of frying things do not buy this product maybe that's why it's not available a lot of places this thing should have been recalled and fixed by the company mine went in the trash i'll go back to the old style with the glass lid
3,defective lid,"Each time I use this fryer I tell myself to write a review on it. Finally here I am. This fryer would have five stars if not for the lid opening at will. Like others, while using it, the lid keeps popping open. Kind of dangerous situation. This is a defect that T-Fal ought to address. Great fryer as far as the cooking goes but not recommended because of danger in getting burned by splatter."
3,T-Fal deep fryer,"I liked this product it worked well and looked very nice. The only problems I have with it is the outside surface gets hot when on and the fryer was alot bigger than it needed to be, hard to store."
2,Easy to use deep fryer with a defective lid design,"The fryer works well and fries to perfection. It's easy to use and has a great looking design. However, the lid on this unit has a tendency to not stay closed. I have purchased three of these and gifts and have had to return two of them and the third I'll have to submit to warranty repair.I recommend that you do not purchase this product."
4,Great Useful,"it is very great just take care of the door when you open it by the other hand ,,,, it takes large amount of oil ... other thanthat it's T Fal."
5,Amazing,"This is a GREAT deep freyer, totally worth the money... I used to own a FRY DADDY, and it was very messy. This deep freyer is a little intimidating at first but once you use it you will love it. My house had no deep fry smell when I was done using it and I only had to make 1 batch of fries for my family of 3. It's also very convient, when I was done with it I just unpluged it, closed the lid and pushed back in the corner. There was no splattered grease mess either."
3,"A good fryer, but needs a few changes.","I like this deep fryer, but there are a couple changes that need to be made. The chrome sides become hot during frying, so be careful. Also, the lid is tough to close when the basket is in the machine because the fit is a bit too tight.On the plus side, it cooks evenly and quickly, much quicker than my previous fryer. The size is also a big plus, especially if you're cooking for more than 2 people."
2,deep fryer @ t-fal,"I BOUGHT THIS FRYER JAN. 2008 1ST THE GOOD. IT'S GREAT LOOKING, FRIES GREAT,NOW THE BAD, AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF ALMOST DAILY USE THE LID STATED POPPING OPEN WE WOULD CLOSE IT, IT,LL STAY CLOSED AND THEN FOR NO REASON POP OPEN. SO WE CALLED T-FAL STILL UNDER WARRANTY THEY TOLD US TO RETURN THE UNIT, PLEASE NOTE I MENTIONED WE USED THIS UNIT DAILY WELL ALMOST EVERY DAY SO TO SEND IT BACK WOULD POSE A REAL PROBLEM FOR US. SO WE OFFERED TO BUY A NEW LID CONSIDERING WE HAD IT FOR LESS THAN A YEAR, WE WERE TOLD THE LID WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE HOW CAN THAT BE. WE WILL NEVER BUY A T-FAL PRODUCT AGAINBOBTAMARAC,FL."
3,not bad looking,"first time to purchase this item,but for the price i gave it a try and it looks good and performs ok."
3,OK MOVIE,"This is a ok movie not great. This movie is worth it just because of Lucas Black, even though he shaved his chest for this movie."
5,Aural Seduction,"Here's a film in which the mood is at least as important as the story. I came across it because I heard the score was done by Charlie Clouser of Nine Inch Nails. To my surprise, it's the best use of Nine Inch Nails music since the title sequence of ""Se7en"". The story and the music are like an inseparable force pulling you toward... madness? They really got the dark vibe thing working.Story concerns a drifter who gets a job painting an old motel in this rural town. On one level it's like a 1950's thriller, but it also feels like it's on acid. We watch the main character go through his daily routine, but it's always like there's this huge, horrible thing looming around him. And when we figure out what that thing is, the film achieves some old-school catharsis. There may be some rough spots along the way, but unlike a lot of recent films that rely on cheap ""twist"" endings, Deepwater's twist is the real deal. Well worth watching, and LISTENING."
4,Add on Pouch,I was looking for add on storage for my lowepro backpack and I found this. I like it because it holds my gear secure. The modular design lets me use it with my other bags and packs.
1,A short advice from a big fan of Video Kids,First I heard Video Kids in the USSR in 1985. Anyone who will listen to this CD-single will never understand Video Kids.I have a full album on CD and it's simply amazing.If you are big fan of European 80's and you know what that music is all about you won't like this CD-single.You need the original album.
3,"It's not bad, but album is better","I agreed with the previous reviwer, that if you listen just the CD single it is hardly to get right impression 'bout the group. You're needed an album (""The Invasion Of The Spacepeckers"", 1984). It's easy, simply contact me by my e-mail."
5,"Amazing and pertinent, a must read!",Mr. Scott's book is truly amazing. The way that he portrays these men in a humanistic way that makes you truly care for their plight and outraged by the actions of our government. The parallel to New Orleans is shocking and touching in times like these. A definite must read. Mr. Scott is reaching his stride in his writing and I can't wait for more like this one. Truly poignant portrayls of real figures from our history.
3,Not his best,"The Watcher and Other Stories is a collection of three of Calvino's stories put together in a single volume for no obvious reason other than they are by the same author. As a fan of Calvino's work, I have to admit that this is the closest I've come to describing one of his books as ""tedious."" However, in each story Calvino still wields his pen with an imagination that few can even come close to matching. Each narrative effectively brings the reader to a different world filled with well-rounded characters and unique circumstances--most notably an ant-infested neighborhood.While not the most engrossing of Calvino's works, The Watcher and Other Stories is still worth picking up for fans of the breathtakingly creative author."
3,My least-favorite Calvino,When Calvino's on he's mind-blowing. When he's off he's usually still pretty interesting. This one is only meh. I suspect it'd resonate more for people of his generation and nationality. I found it too dry.
5,Working Great for just the passenger side a 2002 BMW 325i,"When I purchased a pre-owned 2002 BMW 325i, I wanted to upgrade the windshield wipers. After trial and error, I found the PIAA works well only on the passenger side. For the drivers side, I have a Bosch brand."
3,These wipers are average,"These blades are great when the weather is warm, they operate smoothly with no chattering or streaking. Once the temps dropped below 55 degrees they blades get hard and noisy. I'm going to switch back to the OE BMW blades."
5,PIAA Silicone WIpers - best I have tried,"I have tried other wipers, but keep going back to these. They are hard to find locally, but they are certainly worth waiting for them to get to your address. They are quiet, last a long time, and do not leave dirty streaks. Make sure you treat the windshield with the wipes in the enclosed packets when you install the new blades."
4,Very good!,"This has been a very good book and very informative. I have started the plan and I am on my second week. Yes, it is VERY important to intake the water and the sweating, I cannot stress this enough. I also think this plan is helpful to have some professional guidence with also. Each person is different and the plan will affect each different. I was highly impressed with the ease of contact through the website also! Also, note if you start this plan, it is NOT painfree and takes a definite commitment."
2,Advertisement,"Disappointing sales pitch for author's line of products. I was looking for practical advice, but ended up with a book to sell at the flea market."
1,bs,I did the plan and have no changes in my body as claimed to happen by the manufacturer and the KT who markets this for his friend who guaranteed miracle results. total waste of $700.
4,A quick read with good insight,Good info and a one-day read. Very helpful for those with little knowledge on the subject matter.
5,Brilliant book,"Excellent book and health advice. I got rid of my bloated belly in 3 days, and went from 10 stone to 8 stone (my teenage weight) during the diet. You have to spend 2x $26 on the undecenoic acid supplement (most potent substance to kill candida) for the first two months, and you also have to buy a strong natural C-vitamin supplement and probiotics for quite a long time (but you can get these from a health food shop). So you will end up spending a bit of money, but if you can afford it, it is well worth it. I recommend this to anyone who ever took antibiotics, painkillers, birth control pills... they all cause candida. The doctors won't diagnose this but it affects so many things. Read this book if you're interested in the topic. It is cheap enough and after you have the knowledge you can decide for yourself!"
3,good reading,a good read that provides an interesting aspect on the naval life. overall i found it an okay book to read
2,Stick with the original Sassy,"Five stars to Sassy (which was Vaughan's affectionate nickname), zero to the remix. Get the original and don't bother with the rest. Anyone who loves Sarah Vaughan won't bother with remixes anyway: this is just a really sad attempt to get dance club fans to give the jazz diva's work a listen and, the producers hope, broaden Vaughan's appeal that way. Forget it: even complete strangers to the Divine Sarah's music deserve to hear the original, untainted. Sassy never needed special effects, and neither do listeners with good taste. You either like Sarah, or you don't -- no amount of remixing would change most folks' minds, nor should it. Sarah can shine on her own, thank you very much! All of which means you only want the third track, which is the original version digitized. 'Nuff said."
4,Versatile Storage,"Nice dividers, options for storage division. Could be a little larger to allow files and magazines to slide easily from side to side, while browsing."
2,Cheap looking and flimsy,I ordered this magazine file to store magazines on my bookcase. I liked it on the photo because it is wide and have section and most important easy to put/take magazines from from. Most of magazine files I saw in stores like Office Depot are either cheap looking and flimsy or made the way making it difficult or impossible take magazines out if it is placed in bookcase. Unfortunately this one is also cheap looking/feeling and flimsy (esp section dividers). So I am returning it back.
5,Decide!,"This book certainly has a unique style, unseen in any other translation. The textual simplicity could be understood by a child. This can be especially invaluable to the non-Muslim student of religous texts, and will provide a great challenge to the traditional Muslim with its comprehensive takes on Islam. As for the author, then there is none other with such understanding as Rashad Khlaifa has displayed.He was the first to discover a mathematical construct in the Quran with profound results, results that could challenge the most ardent mathematician into regress, thus he (the mathematician) is left stumped only into submitting all due credit to such a phenomenal work that is the Quran.A book for all, a message for all and a free choice for all..."
2,Arabic text is too small,"The arabic text in this book is too small, probably because the author devotes so much space to numerology. Although it is interesting that the occurance of various words occur in multiples of 19, much of Khalifa's commentary is absurdly speculative, such as determining the end of the world from the numbers of lines in some section of the Koran. The book does have a good index though, so if you want to find the section on virgins in paradise (for example) you can easily find the text addressing this topic."
1,Do not buy this book,"I bought this book based on review on this website regarding this book. Intially the translation looks good which was another reason to buy this book, however when reading further, it turns out that this author calms himself to be a prophet and he explains very mathematically how his name is mentioned in the Quran. He uses the same logic and mathematics to prove that quran is a multiple of 19.His number 19 theory is inconsistant. He trys hard to join surahs, verses etc just so that they fit a multiple of 19He claims that the world will end in 2280He claims that all previous translators of quran misentrepeted the quran and he is the only true translatorHe claims that people who die under 40 years old go to lower heaven, and anyone older goes to higher heaven etcPlease stay away from this book. I have just returned it as I don't want my weak iman to get weaker"
3,Don't be Fooled!,"Although this is a good cd, it is not what it says it is. This is not an actual concert of Mingus vs. Evans, but a collection of Mingus songs, and a collection of Gil Evans songs, put together on the same cd. The Mingus songs appear to be the same ones on New Tijuana Moods (without the alternate takes). Of course, all the Mingus is incredible (you can't go wrong with Mingus!), but i didn't like all the Evans songs, a bit too modern for my taste, almost fusion. There is 'up from the skies' from the Gil plays Hendrix cd which is ok (nothing compared to the Jimi's version though). The best song by Gil on this cd is King Porter Stomp. Just wanted to warn people, so they wouldn't make the same mistake as I did."
5,"Both entertaining, empowering and wise!","I LOVED Lorcan's Bane. It took me to another time and another way of thinking. The images of that time and way of life were so rich I could taste the meals, smell the plants, see the village, and love the people. The writing style transported me to another time and place where women and men lived in the recognition of their equal power and value. I want to read more of Mirren, Betha and the magic of being a woman in times when that is valued equally to being a man."
1,Shallow and Redundant,"This book is absolutely useless unless it is your very initial introduction to the concept of a focus group. It is tremendously shallow, sophomoric and uninformative for professional marketers. Redundancies abound in this book, and much time is spent bemoaning focus group facilities' incompetence and other extraneous factors that only tangentially related to the real subject. Mr. Greenbaum offers no actual case studies to illuminate the utility of focus groups. His examples are vague and barely scratch the surface. It is unfortunate that the field of qualitative research is tainted by pseudo-experts of his ilk."
4,Leon Is Back!,"Leon Redbone is one of my favorites and has provided a soundtrack to some of the most important events in my life. His first three (maybe four) albums are his best, and he will never be able to recapture the magic of these early recordings. But with ANYTIME -- he comes very close. This is his best album in ages. His reading of the Swift Jewel Cowboys' ""Little Willie Green"" is great -- his final warblings made me laugh out loud. And he does to ""Moonlight Bay"" what he once did to ""Shine On Harvest Moon"" -- he takes an impossible corny and tapped-out relic and transforms it into a strange, haunting dream. There are lots of other gems here, and everything comes together. Sigh. How lovely that he made this album -- thank you Leon."
5,Classic Redbone,Absoultely sweet music. Redbone with even greater nuance. Great listening and a good pick me up. Highly recommend this CD.
3,Disappointing Ending,"I have been away from reading the likes of Bernhardt, Tannenbaum, Jance et al. So on a recent holiday I happily grabbed this one based on the reviews seen on Amazon. As series writers go, as they get into their 10th book and beyond ... the twists and turns get well old and predictable. This book started out pretty well, it held my interest for a while, but some of the side entries e.g. the priest's notes became tedious so eventually I just skipped them. They did not add much to the puzzle. I flew through the book and fairly early on I figured out 2 of the twists which made the last 80 or so pages tough. When he threw the ending together in the last few pages it made absolutely no rhyme or reason. It read like the author wanted the book over so he chopped it up! Very disappointed! I threw the book away."
5,Aquatic invertegrate cell culture...,Came in a few days in excellent condition. An excellent addition to our university library.
2,Disappointing at Any Price,"These are too light, too hard, too fragile and don't nearly compare to other cushions which are more resilient, comfortable and durable. With others you may have to pay twice the price at a retail store but at least you will know ahead of time what you are buying and you will get much more for your money."
3,Fiskars large ultra light kneeling pas,"Although very light, this product gives you good cushioning. We use it around the house. I'm not sure how it holds up outside."
1,Cheap,"This is a sorry piece of foam. As a previous reviewer said, they do leave impressions in your knees. Also, this product leaves the color of the foam on whatever it touches...your knees, your clothes, your hands...EVERYTHING! Don't buy them."
3,a little light weight,I am a lineman. I visit a lot of underground pedestals. I purchased this item to throw on the ground to kneel on. I have had it for a few months now. It has held up pretty well. I wish it would have been a little beefier for the price tag. All in all a pretty nice item but wish it was tougher.
5,Excellent Product for tired knees,Had one before. Left it out for the whole year. Winter climate changes made it crack. Bought two this time and will keep tham in the garage when not in use.
2,These pads are too hard,Other reviewers have said to get two of these pads because they're thin; I tried that and it was not satisfactory because they are too hard.I prefer the Black & Decker 1707 Deluxe 1-1/4-Inch Thick Garden Kneeling Pad. You'll only need one of those.
1,Kneeling Cushion not worth the money,"This kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening. The foam may be water resistant, but it is not very thick and your knees can feel the sticks underneath it. The foam does not have a protective coating like other kneeling pads I have used, and therefore it takes the shape of whatever it is sitting on (for instance your knees and sticks below your pad). The kneeling pad could be improved for gardening; therefore, I would not recommend this product for gardening."
2,picture deceiving,"i feel the picture of these pads is deceiving. for this price of almost $7 i thought there would be 3 pads; however, when i opened the box there was only one. i am very disapointed in this purchase."
1,Picture is very deceiving!,"The picture showed 3 cushions in 3 different colors, at a price of about $7. There was no ability when ordering to indicate the color, so I figured the $7 was for all 3 cushions. When the package arrived, I was very surprised to find only one cushion, a yellow one. I have no idea how they thought I'd prefer the yellow color. I should have returned it for the $7 credit, but frankly the money was not enough to warrant taking the time. Stay away from this product!"
3,good read,Very good points about the fruits of The Spirit here. The first 1/4 of this book seemed a little dry then it really took off.
2,mediocre movie,"It's a story about a small time thief being fingered by the crooked cop who arranged the deal. He does the time and keeps his mouth shut. When he gets out, he ends up in LA to take care of business. Whoops, he has trusted the wrong people in his plans for revenge. I kept watching this movie hoping it would get better, it never did. As another reviewer already noted, the best bits were Val Kilmer on screen. Okay, so five minutes were great and rest was just there. For a caper movie, it had no real edge of your seat moments. With all the great actors (Gabriel Byrne, Patrick Bergin, etc.), I was expecting a great film but it never delivered. I recommend watching Circus or The Criminal for a great UK caper flick, not this one. Avoid it at all costs."
3,On the fence,"I wanted to like this one. Great cast. Love UK gangster flicks. Intrigued by the improv/lack of script but, ultimately was not moved by Mick Rossi. The big names are good but the story fizzles a bit. Still, it's an experiment worthy of watching for students of film."
2,Good actors in an awful movie,"The cast is quite good, and includes Gabriel Byrne, Vinnie Jones (Snatch), Anthony LaPaglia, Val Kilmer, Patsy Kensit, Bruno Kirby, and others, but even they can't save a movie that is poorly written and directed.It felt quite formulaic, and is not in the same league as films like Snatch, Heist, Usual Suspects, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, etc.Fortunately I saw it on TV and didn't spend any money on it. It wasn't so bad that I turned it off, but it's far from being a good movie. I finished watching since I did like some of the actors (if not always the acting).The movie felt like a school project that could have been polished into a decent film.Some movies are meant to be watched again and again (e.g., The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, etc.). In the case of Played, once is more than enough. 2-stars is a generous rating."
2,great story badly directed and poorly written screenplay,"most of the shooting was done with different kinds of camera, and all sorts of style, not coherent is the main thing u feel about this film, with a great story that could have been done very well. it's a pity that it was on such a low budget and no experts were on the production team to correct all the screenplay. still worth seeing but at times you would press the fast forward a bit."
3,A nice B rated Movie,"I enjoyed the movie, but the plot some times fell apart. It's a nice movie to look at on a rainey day"
3,B-sides,"If you truly love Louis Prima, then you may appreciate this compilation of lesser known songs. While my husband and I like Louis Prima, we found this CD to be rather mediocre and silly. I am willing to give it another listen, but the first one was rather unsatisfying."
3,Good workout - more modest shirt please,The workout is well done. Nice flow and routines. I do grow weary of yoga instructors wearing tops that make both me and my young sons uncomfortable when they walk in the room. I would greatly appreciate instructors' bodies being covered up a little more so nothing's falling out in various poses. Just looking for a workout - not a peep show.
2,A little more blood please,I found this movie to have no point at all. Nothing is explained at all. If you had blood then stay away. If you hate sadoistic behavior towards puppies than stay away too.
5,Pop music kills!,"I've watched this movie twice now and its really not as weird or hard to understand as some of the other reviewers have said. Its actually really simple, people are so involved with trends and fads now that they've lost touch with who they really are, and the extremes(suicide)they will go to fit in. Good gore and good satire make this movie something special. Pop music is dangerous."
4,What feardotcom shoulda been,"This is what feardotcom shoulda been IMHO. The ending, without giving anything away, was wholly unexpected and something you'd expect from manga or anime. The concept of children being evil is not new to the big screen, or small screen (I'm thinking in particular of Serling's Twilight Zone with the child that wishes everything his* way), but one incorporating the internet/BBS'es (yes, I'm that* old LOL) is...and adds to the whole creepiness of the film. Several American movies have had similar plots to this, but the whole feeling I had while watching it was that of an anime with live characters -- especially the end (which I won't reveal). Personally this is a movie that I won't be ready for watching again for at LEAST 5 years; it was that* creepy -- though I'm glad I did* watch it, it belongs up there with the new wave of Japanese masterpieces IMHO. It's VERY intense."
2,Confused,"I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense."
1,One of the wost films I've seen. Ever.,"I took this film not knowing what to except. This movie was on tha wall of ""Employees favorites"" in our local Blockbuster. Well, if I'll find the guy who nominated this movie I'll definately ask him for my money back.More to the point - this movie is NOT a thriller - there is no logic, no explanation, and lots of loose ends. It only show bizzare, unrelated event, and some (not too many) gory details. If you do take this movie after reading this, hoping that maybe ""This Amir guy did not get it"", and ""There must be something good about this movie"" please come back later and write your honest review..."
5,Underlying tones of pop culture and selfishness,the other 5 star reviewers said it perfectly this movie it worth your time. It will amaze you.
2,This movie was awful.,"I don't know if anyone pays attention to these reviews or not, but believe me...this movie stinks. If you want to see a similar movie done much better try ""Battle Royale"".Suicide Club's opening scene was great, but it was all straight downhill from there. It just kept getting worse and worse, even ending horribly with the all girl pop group ""Desert"" singing over the closing credits. This movie is unintentionally funny in several places, but overall it's a loser."
4,Odd,"It has very good photography and feel, but it's a bit hard to follow. It seems to try to have a moral message, but it doesnt deliver very well, so the ending leaves you drawing a blank. Nonetheless, vivid and stirring."
3,odd...just odd.,"Now i'm not a huge watcher of japanese film but I have seen some and enjoy the stuff I have seen quite bit (death note, battle royale, akira) and thought the premise of this movie sounded pretty decent but that's basically all you'll get from this movie is decent.There are some great suspensefull scenes but they are sandwiched few and far between a lot of filler and slow paced scenes. A lot of things piece together at the end of the movie but there are also a lot of things i'm still wondering about. It's good to have stuff to contimplate after the movie but some of the more interesting things that happen in the movie are never really solved. Child on the phone, wheel of skin, who the heck genesis is and what he's about.Worth a watch but not a buy. Replay value is next to none."
4,All it takes is just a little heart and courage on your part ...,"Well, this was a random purchase on my part, so I thought I was prepared for anything...even 54 girls hopping in front of a train simultaneously. Interestingly that wasn't the craziest part of the film. A detective story with an almost Rod Serling twist, or a thriller with a detective setting? Either way this was and interesting look at cinema in general and Asian cinema in particular. As long as digital blood doesn't bother you (a growing trend in Japanese film) it's an interesting story that will entertain most audiences and inspire a few interesting conversations. (Seriously, watch this with some friends and see what discussions start up.)"
5,A both beautiful and macabre film!,"Suicide Club is an explorative Japanese film asking intrinsic questions about societal taboos in relation to individualistic connections.I found this film both macabre and beautiful in the way it showed characters interacting. It brought up some excellent points about how loss is felt universally, not just locally, and how the health of one affects the health of another. These types of explorative films are usually discouraged in American Theaters because we tend to push a culture of ""buy buy buy, don't ask why"". But this film definitely diverts from American cinema in its ability to ask the gruesome questions that plague human psyche, directly relating to the origins of pain and suffering and how they play out in society."
2,Crap art,"I just spent $13 to buy this DVD since it seemed pretty interesting from all the reviews I read about it. Bad idea, huge waste of money. I believe the general consensus of everyone that watches this movie with me was this movie's fu**ed up. It's obviously satirical, but it was trying too hard to be artsy. There's really bad subtitles, which gives you an idea of what they're trying to say but comes out corny or stupid. Lots of the scenes in the movies don't make sense and once again comes off as stupid. There are some disturbingly sick parts, but aren't enough to be gory. It wasn't scary at all. Althoung it was disturbing, and had really bad flow/organiztion in putting the story together. It definitely had potential in becoming a really cool movie, but seemed to do everything it could to make it become the worst it can."
3,it's ok,"The first half of this film really sucks you in. You're on the edge of your seat wondering why are all these kids killing theirselves and what's going on with that roll of human skin? What could have been a thrilling horror flick sinks under the weight of a convoluted, nonsensical plot . . .something that plagues a lot of Japanese horror flicks. Perhaps, because I found myself nodding off towards the end, I may have missed something but not much. Interesting to watch if only for the first thirty minutes. After that you're besieged with glam queens, girl pop bands, secret subliminal suicide messages and a weirdly surreal ending at a concert. Maybe something was lost in translation. Recommended if you're a fan of Japanese horror and don't mind not fully understanding the gist of the plot. If you are a fan then check out Uzumaki, Dark Water and of course The Ring which are all creepy and actually have a plot you can follow."
4,Mesmerizing...,even if ultimately unsatisfying and a bit mystifying. It will stick with you though particularly the pop culture references.
2,Club What?,"Ok, so a movie about a group of school girls killing themselves sounded intriguing at the very least. I'm sorry, after the plot brakes off into more branches than a Mormon family tree, I found myself thinking what the real reason behind this movie was. So I looked for a common theme, and of course everyone has spoken about the critique of Japanese and capitalist culture; but I am simply not happy with that. Look, this move is just plain bad. The theme is something like this: kill yourself, become an individual . . . oh no. . . . just kidding (insert Japanese school girl laugh) living is the best and makes you an individual. All and all, it's more incoherent than Descartes' account of clear and distinct perception. I'm sorry, but I just like it when my movies make sense all the way though, rather than tricking the populous to think something more Existential is going on."
4,CHILDREN OF THE PAST,"A documentary about a group of children and adults exploring the meaning of Hitler's genocide. Uses free association, dramatic workshops, interviews, living histories, and flashbacks of Nazi newsreels to make its impact.This film is available along with ""How Come Israel?"", ""The Good Omen"" and Herschel Bernardi's narrating of ""The Hangman"" all on one tape entitled ""Holocaust"" listed here on Amazon. Highly recommended for those interested in religion and history."
1,truly awful,This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The story makes no sense. The dialogue is laughable. Whoever wrote and directed this film watched too many Tarantino rip-offs and decided to do just one more. Don't waste your time.
4,Machine Quilting: A primer of Techniques,"Was a good overall basic review of machine quilting. I was hoping for a few more ideas/patterns, but will use those in the book and go from there."
3,good looks - not wool - slides around,"It does slide around, so I bought some ""Super Grip"" (non skid spray) and sprayed it on the back side. It's great now and Super Grip does not stain the floors. Also, the mat is not wool. When I did a search, I typed in 'wool bath mat', and this came up. I asumed it was wool, but it's not. Not sure what material it is - I took the tag off. But since I sprayed the back, I really like it."
4,Great political reading to keep off the election year blues,"This book is neatly organized into sections devoted to topics upon which politicians are apt to speak: getting elected, foreign affairs, D.C., war, money, power, etc. There is an index in the back allowing you to search by person quoted. It is full of wonderful gems of millennia of political insight as well as biting humor about the American political system such as ""George Washington is the only president who didn't blame the previous administration for his troubles."" -Unknown"
4,Too big to be carried on belt,This is overall a very good product but it is just too big to be carried on the belt. I was looking for a beltpack that I could potentially use also when going for a hike. This is more a back pack you can sometimes carry on you belt.
4,Enchanting,"Although there are only six enchanted lands in this book, they are wonderfully presented. Each enchanted land is jam packed with pictured information. The sidebars give you points of interest as well as danger points. This is a fun way to teach your child map reading basics."
4,Great for a 4 y.o.,"My four year old daughter loved it. She got it for Christmas in CA and I saved it for our drive back to TX. She watched it several times, even when we got back home! My 12 y.o. watched it, too."
2,Creepy parts for little kids,"I love this movie's music and the overall plot is fine. I would enjoy it without the outright murderous villainess. But showing it to little kids I'd feel the need to fast forward probably 20 percent of the movie. The evil queen is very clear in her intentions to poison and murder, she's not nice to her rat henchman, and she's got a creepy monkey. Not a fan of any of that. I get that she's the villain, but for little kids I don't feel the need to teach them about murdering, poisoning, and animal cruelty so blatently at age 3 or 4."
3,Pretty Cute Movie,"I really enjoyed the Barbie Island Princess Dvd, I kinda did not appriciate the idea that animals were raising barbie and she was communicating with them on a human level, however I did find the peacock very funny which I think is what barbie wanted to accomplish with that element of the story. Aside from that small complaint, I do not recall any negative content in the film, most of the music was nice rather than cheesy (well other than a cheesy song sung by rats ofcourse) I really liked how the princess and barbie interacted with each other and over all found it to be a very nice family movie."
2,would'nt play,"I recieved this movie fast, but there so many scraches on it it would not play very well.Take notice when it says there are scraches on a disc."
5,Love it,I love watching this movie with my daughter. The Barbie movies are all pretty good. This is my personal favorite.
3,"Enjoyable, but not as good as the previous Barbie movies",My daughter LOVES all of the Barbie movies and was very excited about the Island Princess. She watched it 2 times and has not asked for it since. The music isn't as entertaining and somehow doesn't have the charm of the others.
3,In all fairness to Little Mermaid,"Sorry, I haven't seen this Island Princess movie. But just to comment on the other reviewers thoughts on the Little Mermaid, you must keep in mind that Disney was working tightly within the confines of an existing story. Barbie seems to take much more license with their tales based on existing works. So far, this approach has been a huge success for them as far as the quality and depth of their renditions of these classic tales."
5,LOVE IT!,It is a very cute movie and my 4 year old daughter watches it over and over again. I has very cute songs that she already learned. I recommend it!
4,Another hit Barbie movie!,"This is one of the best Barbie moveies made. I am a mom of a 3 year old and in the last year, we have purchased every Barbie movie made. My daughter loves it, especially the singing and the animal characters...Azul is her favorite! At first, the songs were very annoying to me, especially the opening track ""Here on my island"". However, they soon grow on you and now I find that they get stuck in my head! As an adult, I think that the movie is actually pretty good. It rivals some of the classic Disney movies, which had a higher production budget than Barbie. Of all of the Barbie movies, the new Diamond Castle is our favorite, followed by The Princess and the Pauper. This would probably be third."
1,Not For Kids!,"WHY do children's movies have to have adult themes? Why do a boy and a girl always have to fall in love? I don't want my 5 year old thinking about this crap yet!! SHE'S FIVE!!! Not fifteen!!!I just wish that Barbie movies were more... innocent. Can't Barbie just play with her friends and do fun things instead of having a ""fall in love"" theme to almost every movie?The thing that bothered me the most with this particular movie was the mother of the princess who is a disgrace to humanity. She sings about marrying an old guy so he'll die quick and she will inherit his wealth. I just don't understand why they need to put this stuff in a kids movie. Don't they know that 4 and 5 year olds are watching this? It just seems like such a ""mature"" theme for such a young audience...Can't anyone come up with a good, child-appropriate story line for young children beside Elmo?!!!"
5,A Cut Above the Rest,"Being a child care employee, I have seen every Barbie movie made, except Fairytopia and Mermaidia. And Barbie as the Island Princess is one I would watch even if I wasn't in child care. The music is memorable and fun to learn. The animation and color is vibrant and inviting. The characters are full-fleshed, not the 2D characters of old. I'm not talking about animation style, I'm talking personality. They have problems BEYOND that of Ariana's scheming. We have culture shock, homesickness, plotting, jealousy, and that's WITHOUT Ariana. Barbie began a tradition of wholesome family entertainment, succeeding where Disney now fails (as much as it hurts me to say it)"
2,It's Barbie. Your Pre-school and young daugher will love it,"My 4 year old daughter doesn't care as long as it is Barbie. However, she has only watched this one a couple of times. Not her favorite. 12 Dancing Princesses and the New Charm School movies are her favorites. Diamond Castle gets watched a lot as well. However, for me personally, it is no different than the others. Maybe a little more boring or unimaginative but not significantly. Worth no more than $5."
3,from a 13-year old Barbie lover!,"I like this movie, but it's got a few glitches. I didn't like Tika, her eyes are just CREEPY! And she was a whiner. I feel like the animals are more important to Ro than her soon-to-be husband, (sorry, i could say 'spoiler warning' but YOU KNOW SHE MARRIES HIM!) and when they can't get away from them for two seconds,it's annoying. Second- Arianna should have gotten a better punishment! SHE WALLOWS IN MUD-- BIG DEAL! And Prince Antonio was so... bland, and sort of annoying. Besides, there were only three really good songs. Not like the Princess and the Pauper. I miss the old fairy-tale style. But I like the storyline, it could have been better if they'd eliminated some of the animal involvment and spiced it up a bit. And I still like it. So 3 stars."
1,I hate this item,Thia was supposed to be a portable mp3 player but it wouldn't work unless it was charging
1,You can find something better to do with your time,"Sexy but untalented Emmanuelle Vaugier plays a psychic FBI agent (no, we haven't seen too many of those) who must confront the aftermath of the government program that produced her. Aside from the uninspired direction, the dull screenplay, and the underwhelming performances, it's not a bad film. It's always depressing to see quality performers such as Eric Roberts, Clarence Williams, and Michael Moriarty slumming in substandard product. I would include the dependable Michael Ironside in that list, but hasn't he built his career on this kind of thing?/"
2,Far fetched MKULTRA film,The discription on the back looked interesting but there so many side plots I got lost in the purpose of the movie. Russians detroyed a U.S. facillity which was training children in the art of psychic powers for use as agents. Years later our heroen is working as a detective using her psychic powers to find missing children. In the process she ends up in a love camp which is led by a childhood friend who is planning world domination. Bad Screenwriting takes over and destroys the movie.
5,One of our favorites!!!,"We love this book. We borrowed it at the library and my 2 yr old son kept asking for it, so I eventually bought it. He loves to finish the last phrase on each page ""how do you do"" and always points out all the different vehicles, shapes, animals, etc. I've bought this book for friends as well and they love it too."
5,Fun and colorful read!,"Great book, my 11 month old has loved this book since I started reading it to her a few months ago. It is colorful and the rhyming keeps her interested."
5,My Twins go ga-ga for this book!!,"Such a lovely book! My twin girls( 14 months) will flop onto their bellies, listen and look as I read! They usually follow with much babbling and shout ""Baby!"". The pictures are wonderful and the story rhymes.The baby is very cute! Love it in this household! You will too!!!"
5,Books for Kids,Ordered Japan for my six-year-old grandson--he was thrilled to have it come so quickly and in such good condition. Thank you!
1,unsatisfied,"My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit."
4,Good overview,"This is a nice overview of Chihuahuas -- everything from health to breeding to grooming. There are some training and trick tips included, which may be okay for some people. If you use operative conditioning (clicker training), this may not be enough for you. I do give it a paw and a half up, though, for being pretty well-done!"
4,Good book - very informative and helpful,"Having wondered about the many different behaviors of my Chihuahua, I found this book very helpful and gave me good insight into my little guy's moods. I would recommend this book as required reading for any Chihuahua owner (or is the other way around?)."
5,Great how to book,"I bought this longggg ago and just got around to finishing it, while laid up with surgery and illness. I love the simple explanation of everything in the book. Our little friends can be taught with patience and a good how to guide. I think this is perfect for the first time humans of any chihuahua."
3,new dog owner,"I just got my first dog, a 14 month old chihuahua. I bought the book because of the excerpts that I read and thought it would be really helpful. It was to a certain point. Like it said, it is for dummies and not as in depth as I would like. I have a friend who's very experienced with dogs in general and was able to tell me everything I needed to know. The book just confirmed the same so I didn't find it as helpful as I probably would have if I had no one helping me. I also think it was focused more toward puppies rather than an adult chihuahua. Given that, it would be fine for a beginner. It's easy to read and follow."
5,Good,I liked this book very much. It had Info that I needed to know about Chihuahuas and how to raise them.
5,It has everything!,This book I recomed to all! It is very useful to anybody who is planning to buy a chihuahua or who already has one.It has whole chapters for grooming and for nutrition and lots more on chihuahuas!!It is really helpful and at the same time entertaining and funny!
5,"Sit, I said sit!","I brought this book for my friend, and she has found some very useful information in it regrading the raising and caring for of her Chihuahuas."
1,Useless marxist analysis,"Great book if you want to explore the feebleness of marxist analysis. Author spends two of seven chapters trying to work out a definition of profit, and fails. Well, you will not get an analysis of profitability if you do not have a useful definition of profit. Besides, in 20th century America (when this book was written) there was no problem with the definition of profit, so what was his problem? His problem, of course, is he is a marxist, and a mighty big problem that turns out to be.If you want an economic analysis of Southern slavery, you will do better with ""Time On The Cross"", which is one of the earliest exercises in investigating ante-bellum slavery with modern economic tools."
3,A good family style movie,"I first saw this movie as a teenager and was glad that this movie is still available! This isn't a GREAT movie. It is a very GOOD movie.The one thing that struck me about this movie when I first saw it was how two young kids struck with a horrible tradegy survive in the wilderness on their own. Sort of a dumbed down version of the ""The Edge"" with Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins and a much younger cast.If you're looking for a ""safe"" movie for your kids and one that deals with overcoming hardship you're picking up the right video."
1,Review of Cold River VHS Video,The VHS tape had such poor tracking it would not play regardless of how we attempted to adjust the tracking.
1,Read the book,"I have my students read the book Cold River in school. I was excited to see a video of this story as it is a favorite. But, this video is terrible. They have changed so much from the book. My advice--read the book and forget the video. Holes is the best movie I have seen that came from a kid's book."
2,I did not like this movie!,This movie was pretty bad. It's a little to violent and it is pretty sexist. It was very fake and to many heart-thumping things happen. Get another video if I were you.
5,A Tour de Force of Ancient Wisdom,"This is a most excellent book. The author excels in every way of bringing a vast body of knowledge together in one place, distilling the wisdom of the ancients into a small easy to read book. Thank you so much Mr Chandler for writing this book. May you write many more!"
5,Cyclical Time and Sacred Geometry,"Chandler introduces high and sophisticated concepts about science and living in language that is accessible to most knowledge seekers.For those not mathematically inclined, this book is unique as it examines how math overlaps with science, bodies, spirit and emotion.The best parts of the book are the references to spirituality from every race and group of people. He does not spend too much time on Christianity, rather focusing on Taoism, Dogon, Doha, Kmt, Dravidians and Greeks.This book is a must read for any theologian, scientist, body worker or regular atomically spiritual being seeking deeper understanding."
5,amazing ska music,"one of the greatest albums put together. very soulful, jazzy ska. my favorite ska band of all time. after all,they are from my home town. special guest vocals from the girl from the nyc ska band metro stylee. not your generic ska. these guys were amazing"
4,outstanding,"I am from Massachusetts and I've seen the Agents a number of times. In fact I went to school right across the bridge from Fall River... where my friend's band, Skavalanche, opened for them at Fall River Celebrates. My favorite song is Scully, although I was a little disappointed that there was no female singer with them when they played it live. Dawn, keep on playing... you're the coolest member of the band for sure."
5,i can't listen to this cd without skankin' it up!,i've been listening to the agents for a few years now and i love them!i even got my mother turned on to them.the songs range from a little hip-shakin' to an all out skankin' fest.jay dalomba's incredible voice is backed up by an amazing group of very talented musicians.local bands such as the agents make me proud to be from rhode island
3,"The good, bad and the ugly.","A strange album, containing some of the best and worst this band has to offer. Let's get the bad out of the way. ""High Priest of Rhythmic Noise"" (""don't give up, get up, get down""....yikes...why didn't you just write ""that's the way, uh huh, uh huh, I like it"") & ""Who D'king"": OH COME ON YOU GUYS! What were you thinking? Ok, those shameful examples aside...and several nondescript others, this CD is still worth buying. Why? First and foremost,"" World's Greatest Lover"". What a gem. Also, ""Just Got Back"" is infectious, ""Baby Loves to Rock"" (more and more, I'm thinking about ssssss....sssss....come on Robin, say it...SEX, lol), ""Can't stop it but I'm gonna try"" and the hilarious ""I love you honey but I hate you friends"". One final question: Was George Martin really in the studio with the band? If he was, damn..he was asleep at the wheel."
3,Middling Trick,"Overall not bad, but the songwriting is sub par compared to their first three (and three best) albums. ""Just Got Back"" and maybe ""Baby Loves to Rock"" are the only real winners here, the rest being in the passably good to downright bad range. Also, I don't think the orchestrations really suit them. Too bad they didn't include ""Everything Works if You Let It,"" the terrific single also produced by George Martin that should've been a big hit but wasn't."
5,cheap trick silver,"what a great live cd to listen to. i was just a average cheap trick fan until i listen to "" silver "" now i own all their stuff. great singing from robin zander who is known as "" the man of a thousand voices "". listen to this cd and you'll find out why. the acoustic versions of songs i knew were awesome."" voices "" became my favorite. old hits like ""surrender"" and""i want you to want me"" never lost their luster after all these years. special guest performers like guns n roses guitarist slash and art from everclear belt out wicked solos.you won't be disappointed with this purchase.enjoy!!"
4,Not the best Trick but way better than most other bands!,"Some other reviewers have commented on this being the first collaboration with Sir George Martin and Geoff Emerick and that the sound was muddy....well, listen again to the crisp guitars in Baby Loves to Rock (In the morning, in the evening). Sometimes Rick Nielson's playing requires some leeway-- he can run all over the place. With Tom Petersson's 12 string bass the dynamics of most CT recordings are already wide open, what more do you want? BTW I saw CT at Radio City with UFO opening, they were also promoting a George Martin/Geoff Emerick production, and I can't say enough about either band or their performances. All Shook Up is way better than Dream Police or most subsequent efforts."
4,They Finally Found All The Parts,"""All Shook Up"" has always been one of Cheap Trick's most problematic albums, and the muddy mix of the original CD issue only made it that much more of a difficult listen. This remastering job goes a long way toward reclaiming some of the virtues of this recording, although it does bring the weaker material (""High Priest of Rythmnic Noise"")into somewhat unwelcome relief. No matter. It is still, overall, a decent album even if it is not on par with Cheap Trick's best. The real treat is the inclusion of the long lost ""Found All The Parts"" EP. It's nice to have these songs back after all these years. Well worth the price!"
1,What Junk,"Making the effort to use an orchestra to simulate keyboards was th first thing about this album that turned me off. The singer's insistence at sounding like John Lennon doesn't help much either. No wonder the bass player left right after this album, I hope he threw a rock at them for making him play such drivel. This is the start of Cheap Trick's downward spiral and they have yet to recover. Good riddance!"
5,Great to read and great to wonder about...,"As a person who lived through this era as an adult, I found it fascinating to wonder if something like this could have been going on behind the scenes...and the belief that it COULD have makes it more fun to read, and more scary...it would certainly explain a lot. The author did a good job of making a strange sounding theory plausible and I enjoyed reading it very much."
5,FANTASTIC!,This is my new favorite Christmas CD. The upbeat songs are truly joyful and put me in such a festive Christmas spirit. You will LOVE it!
5,David Schnaufer,"If you like the sound of the Tennessee Music box and Dulcimer on this record, played by David Schnaufer, you should like David's CD ""Delcimore"" on which Cyndi sings the hauntingly beautiful ""Twilight Eyes"""
4,No complaints,"Arrived on time, in brand new condition. Woot. Great to learn from other's mistakes rather than first hand. A friend recommended I read this, and I recommend it to you. One thing I didn't realize was that these are skinny books published each year: there's a lot to read. Have each of your buddies buy a different year and keep it in their car so ya'll can read some each time you drive out to a climb."
4,A Prerequisite For Climbing,Sensational edjucation-the most important way to understand the frequency and causes of climbing misfortune.
