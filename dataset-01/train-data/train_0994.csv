4,Useful reference for Portal Administration,"I found this book to be a helpful reference. For example, the explanations of some of the portlets helped me understand how to use them better than any other information I searched for."
1,Written for old version 4.0 of WS Portal,I regret that I've bought it. The version 5.0 of WebSphere Portal has been in use for almost a year and these guys release second edition of this book on version 4.0 of WebSphere Portal. Useless!
2,Unfortunately already outdated again: WebSphere Portal 4.2..,The current version is already WebSphere Portal 5.02 and it includes many fundamental changes... so you better wait until a fresh edition is out.
2,this toy ...,"not just this particular one, but the whole spinheads crew is just crap. the only cool thing about this guy is that he has an accent. we thought it would be sweet to get for our son since daddy is a dj, but it really is just not fun @ all."
3,mixed feelings (pardon the pun),"being a drum n bass DJ myself, this is simply hilarious to me. the whole Spinheads concept is inane and stereotypical, but therein lies its greatness. the perfect toy to bewilder your friends with."
5,One of my very favorite albums,"I grew up listening to great music from artists like Ella Fitzgerald and writers like George and Ira Gershwin. And today I enjoy everyone from Nelly to Yo Yo Ma, and Tom Jobim to Earth Wind and Fire. Q assembled an amazing variety artists on this CD and covered every genre from rap to soft Brazilian jazz. I love every cut on here. My favorite is ""The Places You Find Love."" I have put it on a couple of compilation CDs and I choke up frequently when I hear it. Jones' rendition of ""Birdland,"" bringing together so many wonderful jazz greats is also an emotional treat. I rarely agree with Grammy choices, but I was SO happy to see this album win in 1991. They just don't get any better than this. Thank you, Quincy Jones and to everyone associated with this amazing CD!"
1,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.,"The worst game to come out from Lucas Arts. The grafics are bad. The game is played in a two dimentional third person point of veiw from the top. There is no looking around in this game. The enemy can see you before you see them. If you die, you must start the level over, which can be extremly frustrating. The force moves are limited to only a force push, no throwing lightsabers in this game. Not a fun game to play!"
2,The game is a pain,"The game is challenging which is good thing, but the graphics are kind of weak compared to other games. Another good thing about this game is that you get to interact with other characters in the game which is neat. A disadvantage of the game is if you get stuck in certain places it is hard to get out of and very annoying too."
1,hoorible game,"The game does not follow the movie whatsoever in any way. Sure powerbattles doesnt but it wasnt meant to. Dont buy the game horiblle graphics and you cant jump or do anything.{you can but, you call that a jump?} The last level is way to difficult to beat. i played for a total of 2 months on that level. im not kidding. i am however an okay gamer. i beat power battles in a month and a half."
4,kick a$$,starwars ep 1 is by far the best starwars game except jedioutcast 2.Its based completely on the movie except hardly anyAnikin. the best thing is lightsabers coooooooool.But this game has no flying or podracing yahooooo praise the lord. every single starwars game has podracing flying or a demo derby. the only cool game with flying is shadow of the empire in the battleof hoth.
1,"Star Wars, The Actual Menace","Take a lousy movie and make an even worse game, what aconcept. ................It play's like Tomb Raider with a hangover. From sluggish control's to awkward camera angle's we have yet another game that Lucasart's can't make work on the Playstation.Atleast Nintendo get's ""Shadows of the Empire"" and ""Rogue Squadron"". PS get's this and ""Masters of Teras Kasi""The only tolerable thing about this game is the voice work and the cut-scene's, and I hope you like the cut-scene's because you're going to have to sit through them again and again and again.Save your money and hope something goes right for PS2"
3,"I'll have a Saber with that one, please!","First thing to remember with this game is - KEEP WITH IT. Once you have mastered the controls it does get better. Based on the Phantom Menace movie, you get to control the characters Obi-Wan, Queen Amidala and others. With various weapons, blasters, rocket launcher and the favourite - the light saber. Background music is great, the graphics aren't so great but still playable with. The Cut scenes are your standard fare but are pretty impressive. It does get hard in places but by using the 'try, try again' method you should eventually get through it, puzzles are solvable and light-saber duels near impossible. The only major aspect of the game that I was dissapointed with was the ending - you'll see what I mean when you get there."
1,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think this game is is the stupidest game I have played in my life! First of all, the graphics are messed up and the voice acting is terriable. Second, the game is so frustrating and not fun at all. Overall, avoid this game at all costs."
1,Disappointment,"I'm an adult; My boys and I have had N64 for years and I've played Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, and Zelda 64 - I enjoy the role-playing puzzle solving type games, and my boys 6 and 8 have enjoyed playing and watching me play. We got a playstation for Christmas, with Phantom Menace Episode 1. I find it extremely irritating that I'm stuck watching the movie setup for the first challenge every time I restart. There's no mental challenge to the game that I've seen yet (admittedly, I haven't got too far yet, but I may not have the patience to ever get far). I wish I hadn't broken the seal and could return the game!"
2,Huge dissapointment!,"If this was not a Star Wars game I would have thrown it out the window. The music video of the behind the scenes movie action was the best thing this game had going for it. The graphics, camera angle, dialogue, and game play were all below par, and the ending was a let down. I am a Star Wars fan, however only a real Star Wars nut could enjoy this game. I want my money back!"
2,"Too easy, a maze game with little action","I waited months for this game and traded a few good ones to get it. I am really disappointed. I expected a Metal Gear Solid caliber of a game, this game doesn't compare in any way. Bad playability, little story or dialogue, and for most of the game you must lead other characters through the mazes who slow you down to a frustrating pace. I really hoped I would love it. You win some, you lose some I guess."
3,good for a psx game,It will be agood game but it would be better if it had some of the pod-racing in it END
4,Pretty good Game,(...)Over all it is an awesome game the graphics arent great but hey its playstation not X box. the fighting is really exiting and the enemies are smart (like if charge them sometimes they will reatreat) it is pretty difficult i wouldnt recomend this game for a first timer(When i say first timer i mean u couldnt fricken beat space invaders)but i would definately reccomend buying it.
4,pretty fun,"the jedi should have been able to jump better. and the force push should have killed the droids. but, i think the fun you can have on the three mos espa levels makes up for it.this is not a bad choice if you are looking for a fun new game."
4,gamer,First of all on this game the graphics Suck very badly You have a limited number of moves you can perform. Also You don't always play as obi-wan OR Qui-gon Jinn This game is extremely difficult to beat the third level is almost impossible to beat. All in all i wouldn't waste my money on this Piece of $h!t game. if your a diehard star wars fan go for it but dont plan on Beating it.
4,Cool game based on a movie,"It's a great game for those who love games like Tomb raider. Sometimes it's a little stressful to play, but the effort is worth it."
4,Great Game,"This was a fun game, if you like Star Wars or not. I enjoyed playing it a lot but some of the levels got confusing at times. Others were a bit difficult because there were so many droids. The Mos Espa level sounds easy but it's more difficult than you think. Just one tip: Don't kill the Jawas! If you kill one, they all start attacking you. Overall this was a great game, I just rented it but I'm thinking of buying it."
4,As close to entering the Star Wars Universe as you can get,This game is really good. I am very pleased with how it takes the concepts from the movie and then expands them. The interactive nature of this game is top notch and the full cast of characters with distinctive voices is a great touch. The only drawback to this game is that there is no vehicular action (it is all third person walking) but it is still great. It can get really hard in parts but it is never impossible. I highly recommend this game.
4,Works Great,"It worked perfectly, but I wish it had come with a scraper. I dont like dulling my knife blade on the metal."
2,only for the hardcore fire starter,"I should have paid attention to the bad reviews and saved a few dollars. While you can probably start a fire with it, this product is terrible. The embedded firesteel does emit a good amount of sparks, but the magnesium bar is useless. The magnesium is too hard to shave. You'll dull your knife or freeze before you collect enough shavings to make a flame. If you're wanting to start fire without a lighter, just buy a quality firesteel and carry your own tinder such as jute cord or petroleum jelly covered cotton balls, magnesium is overkill."
5,Works Well,"I bought this for a camping trip. I made sure to try it at home first to figure out how to use it. The first try took a long time, 30 mins to an hour, before starting a fire. I went back to the packaging and realized i was using too little magnesium, the box recommends about a quarter sized pile. Once I did this it worked like a charm, less than 5 mins. When I took it camping I ran into no problems. I do recommend using a piece of paper or paper towel to consolidate the shavings into a small pile. I used it to start a fire at night and once again in the morning. Both times I ran into no problems. Super easy to use once you get the hang of it. It looks like it should last for longer than I'll be able to keep track of it."
3,Not truly genuine issue,"While this fire starter is made by Doan, this is the civilian version and NOT the genuine issue version that would be issued to the troops. On the side that should have the NSN info, that side is blank.Okay..so does that make this item bad? No. It still works as it should, but I am irritated as I expected the GI issued version and not the civilian equivalent.I'm giving it a three as I feel it is being mis-represented here."
3,Ineffective in the wind,"This makes agood addition to any survival kit, but don't try to use it in the wind. The little shavings will fly away too easily, even if you've dug a hole."
2,"Exelent, but dosn't last.","I would not regimens this product to any one who plans to use it constently, say for camping. It downy come with a striker so I had to use my leather man lacing awl to strike it when I wanted to use it. It wears down to quickly. It does get a fire going nearly as fast as matches, if you know how to use it right, but it doesn't last. If I got lost out in the Bush then it's great, if you don't use it every voter day to light multiple fires."
5,Almost idiot proof,"Works great. You just gently scrape the sides until you have a small pile then strike the flint. My only bit of advice is to make sure you use it in a location out of the wind and on a stable surface.No Hacksaw blade needed, no broken/dull knives necessary, you only have to be smarter than a chunk of magnesium."
4,Great Fire Starter,"It's not as easy as others make it out to be, but once you figure it out, it works very well. You have to understand that one side (the top side in the picture - black color) is the flint, and the whole silver looking thing is magnesium. You have to shave off a good amount of magnesium onto your target (a piece of towl or tissue works awesome), and then you strike the flint side (which makes the sparks) onto the magnesium, which is on the twigs or tissue which catches the fire. To strike the flint, I've tried rocks and some back sides of knives with little success. I've noticed that if you use the back of a knife, it has to be a somewhat sharp corned dull side. What I end up using is the descaler on a pocket knife. This item would be nice if they sold it with a striker, like the swedish models do."
1,"Not ""Genuine""!","They advertise ""genuine issue"", but what I got was a Chinese copy. Plus, I have to pay to return it. When I called, they were not too interested in making me happy. Buyer beware!"
2,Shavings are too small and the flint spark is weak.,Used a flat knife to scrape and spark against the flint.The magnesium shavings were very small and difficult to produce even after 3 minutes of scraping.The environment was some not ideal wood and somewhat windy. But some of the magnesium ignited after about 5 minutes of striking the flint and never started the wood burning.
4,"""It's the real deal...""","I bought this after doing some research... this and ""Swedish Firesteel"" are up among the favorites but this one has the magnesium shavings to help light damp or wet wood. And it is issued to the air force so overall, I trust it."
1,Disappointing compared with other firestarters,"I start alot of fires while camping to keep dry and warm and I wanted to see how this ""classic"" compared with the Firesteel I have bee using.....boy was I surprised.....how can the military issue this thing with such better tools available....its a pain to use and if its windy, FORGET IT! your shavings will blow away. It also appears to wear quite fast. I recommend Swedish Firesteel or another Firesteel product."
3,It Has some Drawbacks,"From my experience:It takes a long time to get a useable pile of magnesium using a knife blade - maybe 10 minutes.If you do get a pile, in all likelihood it will scatter when you try to get a spark to it using this tool. Then you start over.Maybe something else besides a knife will scrape off magnesium faster.And maybe a different sparker (Blast Match) would keep the pile from scattering."
1,Buyer Beware!,Thought this tool would be a great addition to my survival kit for hiking and camping. Tried it out on a recent camping trip only to find out a few things: #1- it is very difficult to flake off enough of the magnesium to sufficiently catch any tinder on fire in a reasonable amount of time; #2-the flint does a great job in casting adequate sparks to ignite dry tinder and #3- the flint actually broke away from the magnesium block! I will try to re-glue it but I'm going to buy another fire making tool.
2,All Weather Firestarters,I tried this firestarter...it doesn't work.Take a look at The All-Weather Firestarters!There is a New Generation of Firestarters at: [...]
3,fire starter,Haven't tried it yet. Not sure why so many words are required for a product that I have not used.
1,Doesn't work easily,Try another firestarter as this one doesn't do the job. Wears out quickly and ineffective.
3,good to have if you have nothing else,"These magnesium and FEU fire starters are good but not great. The small diameter sparking rod, about the same diameter as a pencil lead is only good for about 50 or so strikes, and scraping the magnesium off the opposite side is a hassle. The Swedish fire steels are a much better alternative because they combine the magnesium powder within the sparking rod creating more sparks, and no need to scrape a pile of magnesium before striking, and the strike bar lasts for many hundreds of strikes. That said, these tools are very inexpensive and do perform as advertised. I recommend buying the ones with the small striker attached (made of a 2"" piece of hack saw blade). If you use the back of a knife for striking the spark you'll vastly limit the number of available strikes."
4,Handy with the right striker,"I was frustrated trying to get a spark using the back side of a fixed blade knife. I tried rubbing, scraping, even whacking the flint with only a few feeble sparks. But when I grabbed a pair of regular scissors, the sparks came easily with just a quick hard scrape, as if lighting a match. I'm not sure what made the difference, the material or the shape of the scissors, but from now on, I'll use my scissors for striking."
4,A little hard to get used to.,It is quite light weight and I don't feel it at all when it's on my key chain. Although the little chain that is attached to it breaks easily. Takes me a few strikes to start a fire and I can only do it with a knife or scissor and not anything like a key or piece of metal that is not sharp.
4,Nice,It has instructions of how to use it. It's half the size I thought it would be. Not sure what I was referring the size to. I've never used one before but will give better feedback in a few weeks after I use it.
3,Not great but will work,"The fire steel is not all that great but if you shave enough magnesium off of the block you will be able to create that all important element....fire. One tip, shave off at least a dime size pile amount of magnesium. Although I feel that you would be better off buying a quality fire steel like Light My Fire Swiss Steel or Gobspark, to pair with the magnesium bar."
2,Old Timers Drug Store,"I am disappointed with the firestarter! It was implied in the advertisement as being a genuine GI issue fire starter! The GI isuue fire starter is made by the Doan Mfg Co. of Euclid Ohio! This particular fire starter is a cheap knock off! I am too busy to fool around returning sub standard merchandise, so in the future I will only order branded Merchandise!"
4,Problems with starting in the wind?,"I always have a little fine steel wool in the pack with this, scrape off a little magnesium into the steel wool and spark it.starts fastLearned that trick in boy scouts back when I was a pup and wasn't allowed to play with matches,Burnt down the garage and was the only kid in the neighborhood that wasn't allowed to play with steel wool.Trust me, works great, same as they have for decades.the price is a little highLike anything you should try it before you need it (just don't do it in the garage)"
3,"Good idea, not so easy to use","The only issue I have with this, is that it takes a lot of effort to get enough magnesium shavings to start a fire. If it's a nice day then no problem, but if you are in a survival situation and it is cold then your hands will be frozen by the time you get your fire started. It still remains the best way to get damp tender started though. Any other time I would just try to find something dry and use the fire steel."
5,Makes fire and is quality,Talk about a quality fire starter. This thing works great and Dec 21st is coming up. We will see if I need to order another one.
3,It works but there are better products out there,"There are better products out there if you don't mind spending a little more on them. It's is a very bulky item to carry on a keychain unless you're already accustomed to carrying a ""do it all"" kind of keychain setup, I'd suggest going to a smaller, lighter, less obtrusive setup like the exotac strikers or something similar. This one works well if you're not a weight conscious person though."
5,Good information for the Healthy & ILL,"It is a book that will answer all your questions regarding Food, Diet and Nutrition exactly as its title suggests.My father is in a ""Presistant Vegigative State"" due to a massive hammerhadge, and thats what triggered me to look for a good book that will help me to deal with his special feeding requirment. Not only that I have found very valuable information concerning my fathers situation, but I also found excellent information for me and my wife so we followed a dietery program to loose some weight.Unfortunatly in 'Kuwait' where we live,we have very limited sources of information regarding Food and Nutrition so we needed a reference book that explains every term and has all information needed in details such as the tables and calculating formulas and soforth.In my opinion this is 'a most have book', and in the field of Nutrition it is 'Second-to-non'."
3,Interesting but difficult,"The book is a set of puzzles for the reader to solve, often involving a family of worms that have to split a blanket, cut a cheese, or some other commonplace task that nonetheless can take mathematics to solve in the required way. The author originally wrote the puzzles for the French edition of Scientific American. Some of the mathematics involved is the standard (but interesting) pop-math like games with infinity, but others get into topology and higher mathematics. While many of the puzzles are quite interesting, a few will lose the casual reader (even the well-informed casual reader.) Nevertheless, the pleasure of sticking it out for the good ones repays the pain."
1,False Advertising,"This company is advertising that they are selling an Original Dell AC adapter by Dell. They even have several pictures of adapters that say Dell on them. Unfortunately, what they sent me was some cheap knockoff of a Dell adapter that says ""replacement adapter"" instead of saying Dell. I tried to contact them twice about the problem and no one ever got back to me. It seems like a great deal for the price, but if you want a real, genuine Dell AC adapter, DO NOT BUY FROM the batterycenter. It is just a cheap knockoff with some false advertising and pictures of something that they do not actually send you."
2,You get what you pay for...,"My original adapter had a short where it plugs in to the back of the computer, so back in June I bought this one to replace it. I too got a cheap knockoff, but I figured it wouldn't make any real difference. I was wrong. I don't use my computer much, maybe a few hours a week, and my original adapter lasted over three years. This one quit on me after less than 5 months! Save yourself the time and money and get a better adapter from somewhere else."
3,Buy elsewhere,"Have used this conditioner for some time. I have always been happy with it. I dye my hair a dark brown and use this to try to keep it from fading. It arrived very well packaged. I had to order it online as I was out of the Country at the time and it was not available in my location; however, youcan find this cheaper if you go elsewhere to purchase it."
2,this is ONE bottle not TWO like in the image,"FYI, I just received this in the mail and it is one bottle not two like in the image. I like this product but am disappointed that the image does not represent what I actually received."
1,A disappointing Baby Genius product,"Not at all like the other DVD's put out by Baby Genius such as Baby Animals, Counting Songs, ABC's, etc...this is simply a bunch of sea animals swimming around to boring music and an occasional pop in by the Baby Genius characters. My little boy expressed zero interest in this DVD after about 7 minutes."
1,Non-Engaging and Downright Boring,"This DVD came as part of a 6 DVD set. So far, this one is the worst. It bored me and my 11-month old son. In short, there is classical music that plays while ocean creatures swim around. I am happy that I did not pay for this one separately. Hopefully, he will appreciate it more when he is older; but I doubt it."
2,Not as good as the other baby genius videos,"""This dvd is not like the others I've purchased (Children's Songs, Nursery Rhymes, Baby Animals). It played classical music for the first 5 - 10 minutes and just showed fish swimming. Did not keep the attention of my 17-month old. What she enjoys most about the Baby Genius videos is the singing and the real children acting/dancing. She'll watch some of them two times through but not this one."""
3,its average,it would be better if cartoon fish were mixed with the real fish for my 3 yr old girls. they dont like the classical cd with it. should be more fun modern music
5,Sahara Overland,I was disappointed because I was looking forward to more content and depth about planning and doing an overland trip on camels in the Sahara. This book was useless for me.Thanks for your interest.
4,Terrific!,"You may not have heard of this Canadian telesales expert, but you should. He is one of the businessbyphone.com authors and I received this and two other books in a clear out set from them. What a bargain! Not only does he cover add-on, cross-sell, upselling on the phone, he has sections for converting inquiries, cancellations, complaints, customer service calls into sales. His approaches are just as useful face to face. A no nonsense straightforward easy read, this is a library keeper. His section on getting leads and referrals is bang on the money. Check out www.businessbyphone.com (This is treasure house for telesales answers"
1,BAD SERVICE/PRODUCT,"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY A TV WITH A SEPERATE DVD PLAYER. FROM ANY ANGLE BUT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THIS TV YOU HAVE TROUBLE SEEING THE PICTURE. MY AUDIOVOX DVD TV BROKE AFTER 4 MONTHS AND YOU HAVE TO SHIP IT AT YOUR COST TO A COMPANY IN BUFFALO, NY. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER AUDIOVOX PRODUCT IN THIS LIFETIME."
1,PRETTY SCARY STUFF,"NOT! This is a really lame batch of music. I only bought it because I've been looking for THE SNAKE by Al Wilson forever, and this is the only CD I have been able to find it on. It's not the original version, of course, but it's passable. Other than Gene Simmons old HAUNTED HOUSE, the rest are horrible."
4,Croton Dams and Aqueduct,The Croton Dams and Aqueduct (Images of America: New York)Book is excellent history of the building of the Croton Dam. The photo's tell a great story.
1,DVD Roulette,"[...]It's a crap shoot if this game will work with your DVD player or not. I have 2, both of which are less than a year old, & neither will work with it. It's useless as an educational toy if it is not compatable with the DVD equipment you already own, & you should not have to buy a new DVD player just to make it work."
1,Total Disaster,"Although I had heard complaints of DVD player programming challenges, I figured I was safe since I have not 1, but 2 new DVD players (standard and portable). What a fool! My three year old daughter was very excited to use the system on Christmas morning. Too bad it took over an hour to TRY to program. After numerous futile attempts to program the controller to our main DVD player (JVC)with the codes provided as well as the manual method, I decided to try it on the portable (Polaroid) player. Codes still don't work. But wait, a glimmer of hope! The manual program funtion looks like it may have worked!! I load up the Dora card and call in my daughter. Oh wait, just kidding! The DVD just freezes over and over and over and refuses to work.WHAT A TOTAL PIECE OF GARBAGE. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK UNLESS YOU WANT TO PUNISH YOUR FAMILY."
1,InteracTV --Waste of Time,"We received this toy as present and the mother said ""it took us awhile to get ours to work but our daughter now enjoys the game."" That was the only info I had on this product and I wish I had more. We have already spent over 3 hours trying to get this to work. We were finally able to get it set-up on the bedroom TV but only Sponge Bob works. Dora and Elmo are just blank screens. I will call customer service tomorrow and really don't want to waste anymore time on this product. I don't know if I could ever enjoy this product with the amount of time spent trying to get it to work. It seems easy and you follow the easy directions but you still get no response. If it worked for you, congratulations."
1,very frustrating - a waste of money,I read most of the reviews and decided to invest in this product hoping we would have better luck. We spent a frustrating hour trying to set it up - and it still never worked - finally we thought we had inputed the correct code but the system still would'nt work - called the 1-800 number for help and they dont work weekends. In the meantime my 3-yr old got all excited and was very dissappointed when we told her we would have to return it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
3,Looks better in the box,One of the first things I purchased this past Christmas was InteracTV for my 2.5 year old. I have to say over all I am very unhappy with just about everything from set up to play. My daughter sat waiting for the game to start each time I attempted to set it up on 1 of the 5 TVs I have. Each one had to be done manually and took almost forever to do. Then finally when it was set up and one of the many characters will ask her to select the button she would push the button only to wait 15 seconds for it to register. It also has a fast forward and rewind on the hand held item and if you happen to hit that by accident it would start over immediatly. Needless to say she tired of this very quickly and has since asked me to turn it on.
2,3 times a charm maybe............NOT,"I had to return the interactv for the 3rd time now and I will not buy it again. some of the buttons dont work and the games you put in the interac dont switch to that game automatically. We also have 4 dvd players and it would only work in one-OUR bedroom. we have all newer dvd players and I just cant believe that it wouldnt work. I was sooooooo excited that my son, who is three could play with this, but it doesnt work properly. so today after looking at all the reviews, I will be taking it back and getting the V smile. I did play with the interactv game in the store and I thought it was wonderful until we got it open and started to play.Thanks(...)"
3,MAKE SURE THIS WILL WORK WITH YOUR DVD PLAYER FIRST....,"I was so excited to get this new toy for my 3 year old, and overall it is a great product. However, I should have listened to the other reviews that told me to make sure this would work with our DVD player. The DVD player we bought for my son to use with this game was just a cheap Walmart one, and of course did not work with this game. It only works with DVD players that have Manufacturer Codes. So my advice for all is to, check your user manual of your DVD player first, and get this code. Without this code, you cannot program the controller for this game."
2,Hard to press buttons,"My son got this for his birthday from his aunt and everyone had a hard time pressing the keypad and getting the correct things to light up on screen and sometimes when I would put the Dora disk in,I would get Spongebob and when I restarted the dvd it got stuck on a loop and would play the beginning of the Spongebob song over and over. Technology is great but I think they have to keep working on this one if they want it to be as easy as the commercial presents it."
2,Not Compatible!,"My daughter got this for her 4th bday and was so excited to have it. We had a hard time setting it up and the ""Test"" card would not show up as the directions said it would. i called the company and they said they would send me another remote since this one wasnt working. They did so right away except that one wouldnt work either. I called them back and the next person told me that it may not be compatible with my dvd as it only works on 80% of all dvd players! WTH! He then said I could send it back for a voucher for another toy. Yeah sure thats what you can tell a 4 year old. So I tried it at my mother in laws and after a few codes it works there but overall I didnt think the toy was so great or taught them that much. She lost attention after a few minutes and it doesnt let you switch games in the middle. Very disapointing. I have to say that I also have a vsmile and this was so much easier to setup and my daughter loves it."
1,Extrmemly disapointed,"My 3yr old received this for his birthday. I thought it was difficult to set up. It reminded me of those universal remotes that take a million different codes to set up. What a pain! After all that work my 3yr old was bored with it after about 10 mins. Maybe it was the one we had I dunno, but there was a delay whenever he puched the shape/answer so then he kept hitting all of them & then had no interest in it. or maybe my child just doesn't have enough patients for this toy."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!,"My daughter recieved te Interact TV for Christmas, it is now Jan 7 and we are on our 2nd controller. Neither have worked with any of our relitvely new dvd players. My daughter was so excited to get this toy as a present but will never know how much fun it was. Fisher Price is telling me that the toy is not compatible with ANY of my DVD players and to send it back to them and they will credit me for the purchase price. I am sure it is a very fun toy if only you can get past the setup process.....GOOD LUCK to any future owners of the Interact TV"
1,Beware InteracTV!!!,"I do not know where to begin. I think if I had gotten the thing to work this review would be more valuable. My daughter received this toy as a Christmas gift, and was very disappointed when it would not work. She did not understand why Santa would give her a toy that was broken. I think it is very dirty of Fisher-Price to put out a toy that works for some, but not others. Also the money you spend is not worth the time and effort you will expend to find out this toy in incompatible with your DVD player. Now I have to go to the time and trouble to send it back and have it replaced with another FP product. No thank you. I will not be purchasing another costly toy from FP anytime soon."
1,Complicated,My husband and I worked on setting up the device for over 2 1/2 hours. We tried all of the codes and even the manual code for the control and none of them worked w/our JVC DVD player. My husband works with electronics all of the time and he said he has never seen a bigger waste of product and the product manufacturers must not know what they are doing. Bad programming on their part. We are taking it back and my 3 year old son is very disappointed. We will not buy another electronic product from them again.
3,InteracTV DVD System,"The kid likes it so I guess it is fine. The inserts are not made to last very long, but I guess long enough."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"Well, I thought this would be a great idea for my son with autism. He has trouble holding a small device, so the larger interface and the large remote looked promising. Unfortunately, it never worked properly. After spending an hour to program it, it didnt read the cards properly. It was extremely frustrating and disappointing. It was a good idea that hasn't been implemented well."
1,Unable to Play/ Not Worth the Money,"I purchased a new DVD player just to use with this game. However, the system would not work with the new DVD player. I plan to return the product. [...]"
1,Would Not Buy Especially for an Intelligent 3 Year Old...,"This toy was purchased for my son for Christmas. We have had it one week and three of the four games don't work. They skip, repeat, and jump sequence. First all games worked beautifully but the elmo and then all the games went downhill from there. games are as someone mentioned above very repeatitive and my son was answering the questions before it was asked. He had it figured out in one day. I took this game back (...)!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,Tried many times on our two dvd players (toshiba & magnovox) to get this toy to work. I finally thought that I had it programmed on one player when 5 minutes into the game it quit working. My two children and myself are very disappointed in this FP toy. After the two games and the system was purchased I now have [...]. I wil try to return it.
1,Wish it worked,"We got this for our 3 yr old for Christmass. Tried for several months to get it to work with our TV, we even got a new TV just for this thing and it never worked! We had 4 different adults try to get it to work and it just never did."
2,not so good,We also had problems hooking this up to our DVD player....and we are intelligent people!!!! My son got it as a gift but it took so long to hook up he started losing interest. Then we finally got it programmed and the test card didn't work. [...] It looked like it was going to be cute/fun but it has flaws and needs work! Great idea though.
1,A terrible toy,"I bought this toy for my little boy two weeks before christmas. I had a hard time finding it because it was sold out at most stores. When I did get one, I thought I had lucked out. It turns out I had run out of luck. I have not been able to program this with My Philips DVD. I did have better luck than most programming other DVD players, My toshiba and Emerson Dual VCR/DVD. All the buttons worked, but the program does not always recognize the card you put in. I would not recomend this product. I was most disappointed with Fisher Price customer service. They refused to answer any calls about this unit at the call center and the Web Site had program language errors on the interactv wizard. Many of the codes in the book and online cannot be programmed with the unit. I hope fisher price had a crummy christmas, because I did trying to program this unit."
5,Helpful Hint,"My son got this for Christmas and he loves it. The package says it requires 3 AA batteries which are not included. This is not true. There's a little purple box that if you touch a button that tells you about the toy. There'a a sticker that says to throw it away. DON'T, at least not until you open it up and take out the 3 AA batteries in it. Fisher Price should tell you this, instead of throwing out 3 perfectly good batteries. I almost just tossed my out but I thought something must be powering that voice. I decided to investigate and opened up the unit. What a nice little surprise to see those batteries."
1,do not buy this toy,"i have spent the better part of three days trying to get this stupid toy to work, and to get in touch with fisher price! Cannot get through to them (high volume of calls--must tell me something there, like everyone is having a problem!!!) i have three different dvd players, daewoo, apex, and cyberhome-the only one this worked on was my son's cyberhome (which is in his room, and he doesn't want his sister in there--she's younger, and destroys his things). i asked my mom to buy it for my daughter, and she did (for Christmas), and now my daughter can't even play with it-i am really surprised at fisher price, i thought they were a really good company with good products, but after this i will make sure i read online reviews BEFORE buying one of their products--good luck if you did buy it--i'm getting my money back, and then some, i have a really disappointed child now."
1,This game doesn't work!,"InteracTV wouldn't work with our DVD player. After calling Fisher Price, we received two more models to try to no avail. We tried not only on our DVD player, but on another family member's DVD player and nothing would work. We even tried going through the set up process while on the phone receiving step-by-step instructions from Fisher Price, but nothing worked. So this year, my daughter received nothing from her parents for her birthday and we're still waiting for the refund check which will hopefully get here in time for Christmas."
2,Very unhappy with Fisher Price,"We bought this toy for our 3yr olds birthday. Was very excited that there was a game that was educational at the same time fun and had no wires to get in her way. Her Mimi and Papa bought her a Disney TV and DVD player just so she could play her new game. We get it home and after getting thru the ""parent proof"" packaging, we come to only find out that it will not work with Disney DVD or for that matter any of the DVD players we own, Pionner, Apex. Customer service tried to get it to work on the last 2 but we would get as far as the test card and it did not work. I belive that they put this product out way too soon and way too fast. It is a great idea, and if you can be succesful with your DVD player it would be great. However if you are planning on using this product with Disney DVD -- don't waste your time, Customer Service said they doubt if they will ever get it to work with that system."
1,What a wast of a wonderful idea!,"I have spent the last four hours of our Christmas evening trying to get the InteracTV to work. I have tried everything including attempting to locate additional manufacture codes on the internet to see it they will work. Word of advice for anyone planning on purchasing this unit, open the box take out the ""User's Manual"", and the handheld controller and go to the electronics department of the store. Then following the ""manual instructions"" walk around and press the left button until you see one of the display DVD players turn on or off. Then buy that DVD player because that is the only way you are going to be able use this item. Very very disappointed. I plan on returning this tomorrow. What a marketing idea, create a cartoon based learning system of all our childrens favorite cartoons and then make it impossible for them to use. What a poor solution to a wonderful idea."
1,BAD IDEA,My son is gonna be three in May I bought this toy for him because he loves Elmo and Blues Clues. I thought it would be a great idea to get it since he is gonna be going to school but this toy is not the best for young children. First of all he has not played with it for 5 times and the bottons are already acting up. Even if he pick the right answer sometimes it just does not recoginze it and tells you that the answer is wrong. What a fustrating toy. I will return it and would not advise any parent getting this toy. Just a BAD IDEA..
1,Don't buy this toy,"This toy looks like it would be fun if you could get it to work. We tried programming the controller on three dvd players and even bought a new one just for this game. None of them ""were compatable"" with the system. My daughter keeps finding it and getting very upset because she wants to play with it. We are still trying other dvd players because we can't return it...the box got thrown out on Christmas by accident."
1,DOESN'T WORK,We bought this for our daughter who is three along with 3 of the other disks and no matter what dvd unit we tried to have it work on IT DOES NOT WORK. The codes are not accepted and we have 4 DVD players in the home from different makers. I would not recommend this gift to anyone unless they want their child heartbroken over not being able to play with it.
3,it works 4 me,I bought this toy 4 my 3 and1/2 year old 4 christmas i had no problem setting it up it worked with in minutes the book has a whole different codes for different dvds i dont no why you all are having problemswith itanyway i guess my daughter likes it she doesn't spend that much time on it as she does her other toys this toy does freeze up then you have to start overi wouldn't buy it again its not very entertaining to her
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT - SHAME ON FISHER PRICE,"I was so excited to get this for my kids for Christmas. After much research between this and V-Smile...I decided this was the perfect gift because there were no wires, and it seemed that the graphics were better. Fisher Price always makes great products. Christmas Night was the biggest waste of 2 hours trying to get this thing to work. 2 screaming kids and a screaming headache and I finally gave up figuring I was doing something wrong. After talking with my cousin and boss finding out they had the same problems with this - I decided to check out what everyone had to say on this site. Much to my surprise, everyone else seemed to have the same problem. What a shame. The concept was there - they just rushed it for Christmas.(...)"
3,not compatible,"This has been a big disappointment for my 3 yr old daughter. she got it for christmas and we have not been able to program it on our magnavox dvd player...am I now supposed to go out and buy a new dvd player for a $40 toy? no store will take it back because it has been opened...when I was able to get it programmed on another dvd player which is up high on the wall the signal barely reaches and she is too short to keep raising the controller up to make it work...my 7 yr old can do it but he doesn't need it, the 3 yr old needs it...very disappointed!when I called fisher-price about it they tried to help but said since it wasnt compatible there wasn't anything they could do...fisher price really dropped the ball on this one."
1,Don't waste your time,"I wish I had read the reviews before I went through hours wasting my time with two different controllers. Not compatible with my RCA player; I could get all of the buttons working except for the ""A"" button. Needless to say, both have been returned and NEVER AGAIN.I am also disapointed with the Fisher Price LACK OF Customer support. What a shame...I always trusted their products in the past."
5,WONDERFUL......WE JUST LOVE IT!!!!,"I am astonished at how many bad reviews this toy has!!! Yes, it is a little tricky with all the codes to program it to your DVD player, but once that is accomplished it's over! Santa brought this toy for our 3 1/2 year old who thinks he is a big boy and wants to play video games (not ready yet for that)and he just loves it. It is slow enough so that he gets it yet and can keep up, and entertaining enough that he stays amazed and interested in it. He can do it all by himself, after mom and dad showed him how. Let me tell ya this toy is very educational and works great for our son. We have never had a problem with any of our discs that we have purchased and we have them all. I give Fisher Price two thumbs up on this one!!"
4,My 4 year old really likes it!!!,We had gone over and over the thought of getting this or the V smile and went with this because you just pop in the DVD and your ready to go. Very easy no cords to deal with and programing the remote was very easy just look for the code that matches your player and your set to go. Now I dont feel bad about letting him watch tv because they are all his favorite cartoons but only now he can interact with them and he's learning we think its great cant wait for more videos.
1,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE WASTE","Don't waste your money, I bought this item 3 weeks ago, I wished I'd tested it then instead of waiting on Christmas. It took me 3 hours to try and program it on my Philips DVD player and no matter how many attempts I could not get the button in the A position to work (all others did) until I went to the web site and found out that my DVD wasn't compatible with the system.What a big ""oops"" for Fisher Price and a sad disappointment to one lil 3 year old!They had good intentions, but they sure didn't get the item tested before it was marketed!"
4,Great Toy!!!!,I got the InteracTV Dvd System for my two year old for Christmas and she loves it; that's all she wants to play with. I hesitated about getting this product but I'm glad I took that chance. It took me about 10 minutes to set up and from there my daughter had no problem playing it.Great toy!!!
4,No problems here - kids love it,"My 2-1/2 year old son received this gift for Christmas and both he and his 4-year old sister love it! Despite the reviews, I was able to get the controller working in about 5 minutes on my Samsung DVD player. I was also happy to notice that I could program the controller for up to 3 DVD players including my portable for travel. While I admit it is not as educational as some toys, some of the games (Blues Clues for example - does ask number recognition & counting questions). As a side note, I purchased the V-Smile for my 4-year old and we will be taking that back - this system rates much higher in my book."
3,Interesting but Limited,"My son just turned 3 and is comfortable with a computer and mouse. I think he feels limited by how slowly this toy moves between scenes and the lack of flexiblity at moving from one activity to another. If a home doesn't have a kid-friendly computer, then I believe a child would enjoy and learn from this system. For computer savvy kids, I would stick to software."
4,Wish it worked w/ an X box...,"Well, our 'main' DVD player is an Xbox, and in case you are wondering, this toy WON'T work w/ an Xbox or a Playstation. This could be a problem b/c I know a lot of people who use their gaming systems as their main DVD player. Luckily, we also have a 'regular' DVD player in our bedroom, and I got it to work in there...I did have to go through about 10 different codes before I got it to work, but my hubby installs cable, and programs tv remotes all day so he was a bit of a help. My son is 2 1/2 years old, and he loved it instantly! It says for 3-7 years, but I think that if the child were much over 4 that it would be much too simple for them. Right now there are only a limited amount of discs that you can buy to go with it, but perhaps if it catches on they will make different discs for different age levels."
1,Buyer Beware! Fisher Price Failed on this one!,"Those that got this to work...what DVD and age of DVD do YOU have? Setup was horrible! The compatibility of DVDs should have been listed on box. We tried 3 DVD players - one is 6 months old, one is a little over a year and one is 3-1/2 years old. All are different brands too! The codes worked fine to shut off the DSS and the VCR! It never would respond properly to the DVD so setup was a nightmare! I too wish I would have read reviews before purchasing this for my granddaughter! It sure was disappointing for her and us! How do you rate a toy you cannot actually try? The instructions were of no help either. VERY disappointed!"
3,not compatible with my dvd,"I bought this product for my 2yr old. It wasn't compatible with my DVD player, (a JVC) She loves the toy but can only use it at Grandma and Papa's house. The controller and games are age appropriate (3+) and the stories are easy to follow. The questions never change so be prepared to buy a few different discs to keep your child from getting bored. I do not recommend this product for an older child as it may appear to babyish to them, (The controller is made for toddlers.) Although my daughter enjoys the game I do not think I would buy it again if given the chance. It is difficult to program and if the controller is not pointed directly at the DVD player it doesn't work. I would definately recommend spending your money on something else!!!!"
2,ALREADY BREAKING!!!,My son is 4 and has only played with this toy 5 times and some buttons are already not registering that he he touched it. He becomes very frustrated because it tells him he has the wrong answer even when he is right. Concept of this toy is great but the actual toy stinks. Not to meantion that we had to buy a new DVD player just to be compatable with this toy. Probably will end up selling it on Ebay with hopes of getting some of my money back. Very disappointing.
1,Dont buy this toy!,I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas and it never worked.We tried it on every dvd player in the house (3)and it would not play.We read the directions and tried a few things but it didn't help.Before noon Christmas day we put it away so my daughter wouldn't see it and be dissapointed.We didnt have a lot to spend at Christmas and I wish I had bought something else.I dont have the reciept so I guess it will go in the garbage.
1,Not Very Educatonal if You Don't Ever Get to Play It,"I'm sure that for those of you that actually get this toy to work, it's very fun and educational. I assumed that since I have THREE DVD players by THREE different manufacturers that one of them would be compatible with this toy. SO NOT THE CASE! My kids were so disappointed because they were really looking forward to interacting with all their favorite TV characters. You can only imagine the looks on their little faces when I told them it had to go back to the store! I would recommend, if you're going to try this, to see if it's compatible with your player first BEFORE you tell your kids you bought it!"
1,not for every dvd,"We received this toy for christmas and it would not work with either of the 2 dvd players that we own. I was very disappointed woth fisher price. I also called the help line-- thought i may have been doing something wrong, but it turned out it just would not work with our dvd players. Fisher Price did send me a pre- paid postage to send it back and i received a voucher for $45.00-- the retail price, but now i am disapointed because i would rather have the money then the voucher because i wanted to get the v-smile instead and now i am stuck getting a new fisher price product that i dont want."
2,RETURNED IT!,"This item is not very 3 year old friendly, both my husband and I thought it was difficult to use as well. The control has to be pointed directly at the DVD in order to work ( much like an actual tv remote ) I don't think this is very practical to exspect a 3 year old to sit completely still in order to have the remote angled directly at the DVD player. We returned ours. Hope This HELPS you!"
1,What a NIGHTMARE,"How excited we were to get this, it looked great. Until trying to program it. The toy was great fun for my 4 year old, when it worked which was just about a day. We have a Toshiba DVD player and none of the codes worked so we used the automatic programming. It worked, but then the controller stopped working. I tried for days to reprogram it but to no avail. When I called Fisher Price they suggested I change the batteries! Customer service was poor and we are returning this toy to but V-Smile."
2,Not worth the money and frustration,"We purchased this toy for our 3 year old daughter for christmas. We got it to program to the dvd player just fine but then it wouldn't work correctly. When she tried to play the dora game, the elmo game popped up. The spongebob and dora games would not work at all. Everytime we tried to play it would want us to reprogram the controller again. I had to return this toy and will not be buying another one. It was way to glichy not to mention frustrating for us and our daughter."
3,Not that interesting,"My 2 1/2 year old was more interested in playing with the controller and putting the card in and out and touching the tv screen to give the correct answers. It was so hard to get programmed with our DVD players in our house. Not one of them worked with it. After waiting until Monday (on a Saturday morning) to call Fisher-Price's customer service center (only open M-F 8-5pm), they told me I had to get a new controller which they did send me without having to send back the old one. Since it was right before Christmas, they were nice enough to overnight it to me, too so it would be there on Christmas Morning. Once we got it programmed, my son just did not find it that much fun. I'm hoping as time goes on, he'll gain more interest in it, it seems like it would be educational for him and fun, too. But, for now, he's just not interested."
4,Very interesting reviews,"After reading 10 reviews I can't resist adding one myself. This toy was bought for my 2 year old and we both love it. However, I think the age limit for the toy is way off. My two years old would sit for hours and play if permitted and as a two year old he is learning a lot from this toy. The first three times playing with the toy we worked TOGETHER and now he does everything on his own including changing the cartriges. I read in one review that this toy was bought for a school aged child and I agree with that parent...not the right age for this toy. I do hope that more cartriges will be available."
1,Interac-with-Nothing is a better name,"I do not recommend this product. Poorly designed product with absolutely NO customer support. What were Fisher Price and Mattel thinking? Not only does it work only sporadically with the no name DVD we have and not at all with the 3 popular name DVD players we have, but we can not get ANY customer assistance from Mattel or Fisher Price this holiday season. The web site the 888-892-6123# directs you to tells you they have high call volume and hangs up on you (not even an option to hold). The web site has no content listed in a critical drop box required to submit for online help. I will NEVER buy another Fisher Price product with any level of complexity as a result of this experience. [...]"
1,Not compatible with much at all.,"This was a gift for our son for Christmas, he was so tickled to have gotten it. We tried over and over to get it to work with our DVD/VCR combo to no avail. The customer service said, ""It will work just as well with your DVD remote."" I returned it and decided it wasn't worth the waste of time. The V-Smile has since replaced it and is amazing for our younger children. We've even caught the older 2 cutting in a couple of times."
1,A waste of money,"Not only is it a waste of money, it was a waste of my 3 year old's time, her 8 and 11 year old brother's time and my time! We finally threw it in the trash because we were all so frustrated with it. It never registered the choice you touched, it wouldn't even give you the screen that matched the card you put in. We all tried several times and her brothers are video game wizzes and even they couldn't get it to work. Don't waste your money, time and energy on this piece of junk. GRRRRRRR"
2,This System Faults,I bought this system for my 4yr old son. First it took 20 min to program with the DVD player since i have a phillips dvd player there is several codes yoo have to try to see if it works. Then after he was playing with the system for a couple of min the dvd player shut off. so we tried the spongebob activity that we bought extra and it did the same thing. Now my son is frustrated with the system thinking he has not played with it right. My son is a slow learner and I bought it thinking this product will help him educ. ways. but it did not. My daughter who is older tried it thinking he was not moving fast enough and once again the system turned off on her. after taking another 20 min and programed the system into another dvd player in his bedroom we had the same problem. Personally i do not think this toy is worth the 39.99 i spent on it plus the 19.99 on the extra dvd. I hope this might help.
2,Make sure you have the correct DVD player....,"I bought this toy for my daughter last christmas and despite of some of the reviews I read I said, ""what the heck."" Well, turns out that I should have listen to the previous comments. This toy is good if you can get it to work. It does work with every DVD player. My family and I have two DVD players and it really only works on one. and then my daughter has to sit a certain way and make sure the handheld is pointed straight at the dvd. once you get the system to work, its find but, I still believe it is a hassle because on slight move and you and the kid are fustrated. It sucks too because I bought every game that you can buy with the system. Most of the time I listen to the reviewers but my kid really wanted this.Soo... if your kid really wants this toy, try to convince he/she there is something better!! if not make sure you keep the reciept because once your child plays with it he or she will understand too!"
2,Don't waste your time or money!!,I bought this a while ago for my daughter and it worked okay the first time around. I didn't really have any trouble until I tried to use it on our new DVD player. It wouldn't work at all and the set up is very frustrating. I wouldn't really recommend this unless the store you buy it from has a good return policy in case it doesn't work on your DVD player.
1,Put your money back in your wallet,"Stay away from this new technology. Very frustrating to set up, does not work with all DVD players, DVD constantly loops, more of a commercial for cartoons than real games. Certainly anyone over the age of 5 would be bored very quickly. Save your money and your time buy something else"
2,NOT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS,"We purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for our 3 yr. old daughter. We picked this over the V-Smile because of the lack of wires. WHAT A MISTAKE. It took us over an hour to set it, trying the codes, running the automatic program and trying to reach Fisher Price for assistance. It took so long our daughter fell asleep before we could get it programed. Now whenever she does play with it, which isn't often, you have to turn it off and then back on to change the cards. Its very repetitive and doesn't keep her attention long. How you can the Sponge Bob card is for 4 and up makes me laugh, my 8 yr. old niece had trouble picking the right answers. Overall this was toy was a waste of time and money. For her birthday we are buying her V-Smile."
2,This product needs some work...,"I think that the idea of this product is great, but we have had more trouble with it than any other toy, ever. My three year old is a whiz at the computer and at playing nintendo games, but this game is just so slow, it stops often and it has to be re-programmed so often that it just frustrates her and me both. She is a pacient little girl, but has completely lost interest in this game and prefers to play on the computer and other toys that do not cause so much frusteration and consume so much time programming and re-programming. The ONLY game that worked out of four that I bought was the Spongebob one, and it really rarely works correctly anyway. Maybe this toy can be modified and will be a better product next Christmas."
2,I would not buy this again,"I bought this for christmas. It is not the best educational tool In my opion, very few things to keep my kids involved. not for kids in school. and it is looping itself back to the beginning and very hard to program."
1,Christmas toy Nightmare,This toy was a nightmare. My two daughters recieved it for christmas.Three days later we are still trying to get it to work. We set everything up with the dvd player numerous times and it still would not play the games. The kids were looking so forward to playing it and all it has done is caused our family to fight just the stress of trying to get it to work. I would NOT recommend this game.
1,What a Disapointment,We got this for our four year old daughter for Christmas. On Christmas day we spent hours trying all 4 of our DVD players in the house. We were able to get it to work on 1 but the A button did not work. Assumed it was the game and returned for another. We had the same results. After waiting for an hour to replace it I have to go back and do it all over again. What a waste of time and money. I had the same Java error when trying to access the Mattel website and also searched for other codes. It appears that this product does not work with most DVD players on the market. What a scam and a way to ruin a 4 year olds Christmas. I will probably have to eat the 14.99 for a game I opened and don't have the box or reciept for.
1,dont waste your time...,If anyone from Fisher Price is reading this....you suck.How about testing your crummy product to make sure it works before you sell it for 30-40 dollars? We have a GTE Dvd player and an XBox which plays DVDs - neither will work. How about listing the players it doesn't support on the back of the box or something....FISHER PRICE should fire their product testing department. ARRRRGGGHHH!!!!!!The only reason I gave it 5stars for durability is because I tried to snap it in half from frustration and I couldn't even do that.
2,Boring,"We just purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for our almost 4 year old. We are sending it back! It is so boring. It asks questions--that's it (maybe additional games are better). It's basically one big matching game. Also, we could not get the Dora card to work at all. And SpongeBob did nothing. It was a waste of time and money. I'm glad we tried it before Christmas morning."
5,Most played with toy at our house,"We got this over 2 years ago for our then 3 year old for Christmas. It took about 15 min for my husband to set it up. We also have it set up at both Grandparents houses, and again it took about 15 min. We did lose the book for the codes but they are easy to find online. My dd plays with this all the time, we have every cartrige out there now because she loves it so much. Her 2.5 yr old sister has now started playing with it also. Out of all the toys we have this is the most requested toy out there. And we even changed DVDs recently and had no problem getting it to work on our new TV. This is now a gift that I buy lots of friends because it has a low price, it's eductational, and it's so much fun for the kids!"
2,This is education?,"I got this thing working with some difficulty, whereupon my 3 year old daughter and I played with it for a half hour or so. I would say that it is actually somewhat LESS entertaining than watching the normal, broadcast versions of the shows from which its content is taken.But here's the real problem: it seems we've somehow come to define ""education"" as ""learning to give the specific desired responses to certain questions"". Is my daughter being ""educated"" when she correctly identifies the sound an elephant makes? I don't think so.You know what's educational? Play Doh. Blocks. A ball. My daughter learns more in five minutes spent looking at a patch of grass in the backyard than she could in a decade spent with InteracTV.I have a new rule of thumb about ""educational"" toys. If it needs batteries, you're probably not going to learn much from it. Except maybe how expensive batteries are."
1,InteracTV is horrible - don't waste your time,"I purchased this for my daughters XMAS present, I even had Aunts and Uncles purchase software for it too....what a mistake - just trying to set it up was exhausting - then after we did - my daughter would press the right button and nothing would happen, its like you have to wait for it to respond 3 minutes later...so by now, she thought she pressed the wrong button so she keeps pressing something else....where is the learning in this slow and useless machine....think FISHER PRICE should go back to the drawing table with this one.....and we will instead purchase something that has been around for years.....VTECH which we know freinds have and love it....no DELAY - no FRUSTRATION and kids and parents are happy as they are learning.......keep your money dont' waste it....my daughter still asks to play with it and then gets frustrated with it and places it on the floor and walks away....."
2,Shocked!,"X-mas day not compatible w/DVD player which is HORRIBLE for any child. After hrs & trying numerous codes still did not work. Compatibility needs to be reviewed & made simplier for a kids educational toy. Also, the box should state codes that operate the toy so parents will be aware. Educational concept appears great, however; have not had the pleasure of enjoying it."
2,Mixed emotion...,"My 4 year old daughter got this toy for Christmas. It took me more than 30 minutes to set up the controller. Finally I got it to work. However, the controller stop working after a few games. For instance, on the ""Dora"" game, my daughter is only able to look for ""Tico"" and after that the message says ""press the white arrow key to keep looking for more friends"", but the white arrow key doesn't work. So, the game stops at that point... no way to go back or forward. I am wondering if anybody have the same problem.... I called Fisher Price and press ""3"" instead of ""1"" to get a customer service. The customer service was very nice and said that my controller might be an old version, so she sent me another one by UPS without charge. But to my disappointment, the second controller also has the same problem.My daughter did learned something from the games, but it is not challenging enough for a 4 year old. She liked the games for few days and not it is just sitting in the cabinet..."
1,Kellie Ferrier,"I am very disappointed with this product. The only reason that I rated it with one star is because they required a rating. It does not work with any of the dvd players in our house. My daughter overheard me and her father saying we had to return it and she was devestated. She wanted to know why Santa bought her a broken toy. Why is Fisher Price selling products that do not work!!! I see that many people have had this problem. My husband wants to boycott Fisher Price because of this. I think that is a little extreme but they have devastated my daughter for what should have been a happy day. Thankfully we were able to distract her with the other things ""Santa"" bought her!"
4,JUST OPENED IT FOR HANUKKAH,I just opened yesterday for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. Setup was simple on my Sony 5 DVD player. She enjoyed the characters as she was crazy over Elmo and is now obsessed with Dora. She also saw the Spongebob movie.There are a few bones to pick:1) Ergonomics - forward and reverse buttons are place on grips for handles. Children who don't have developed fine motor coordination will keep hitting those buttons.2) difficulty of questions - some questions involve knowledge that the target age children might not have. The little stories do not provide info that the kids are questioned about; the questions involve prior knowledge i.e. Dora asking if you know where Boots is - He is hiding behind the plant with Rojo flowers [Rose bush]or SpongeBob asking if you can find the Jellyfish hiding behind the animal who grows and has a hard shell [Clam].It seems good for a kid who is old enough. I will try to add to this review as my 4 1/2 year old niece is going to try it out also.
2,Not impressed,"First I will say that this is not compatible if your TV has a DVD built into it as many new ones do. We had to hook this up in our bedroom so my son could play it. He played it for about 20 minutes, (despite my encouragement to keep playing) I even played to try and get him into it, but its just slow and pretty boring if you ask me. There wasnt enough action to keep him interested too long and it didnt always recognize the right discs. I think it may have been rushed to market. I put it away after he finished and figured I would suggest playing again the next day, but he didnt want to play. I kept it for another week or so, and he never mentioned it again, so I returned it and bought VSMILE."
5,GREAT TOY!,"Obviously, before you buy a electronic toy for your child you must first check to see if your TV,DVD, Computer, etc. is compatible with it. We had a older RCA DVD player and when it couldn't play some of the newer DVDs, we realized we needed to update our DVD player... it happens. My son is almost 3 and he needs a little supervison, but he loves it. GREAT TOY!!"
1,frustruating toy,This toy is very frustruating for my daughters and myself. They want to play with it but it messes up halfway through a DVD everytime. They get irritated with it and so do I because we have to restart it which takes forever. This toy was a waste of money.
2,Piece of Junk!,"My daughter received this toy for Christmas and it is February and we still can't play with it! We bought 3 of the dvd games to go with it and they ALL skipped, the disc that came with it even skipped! After having to hang up and call back at least 15 times (because of eternally long wait times) Fisher-price was very good to send us new replacement dvd's at no charge...however, when they arrived they skipped too! We also couldn't get the thing to program to one of our dvd players (A Polaroid)...sometimes it would function on our other dvd player, but not properly (a Toshiba). Finally on February 9th I called Fisher-Price, for the 3rd time, and they offered to pay for shipping to send the interac-tv and all the discs back to them at no charge and give me a full refund. I think the idea behind Interac-TV is a great idea, it just needs some work! Make your life easier and BUY A V-SMILE!!!"
1,System does not work!,This system worked only sporadically. It was quite a disappointment for my 2 & 4 yr. old boys. Shockingly poor quality coming from Fisher Price.
3,I'm not very pleased.,"I bought this thinking it would help my daughter. She's four and found the games relatively easy. The major problem we have with this unit is that the video part tends to disappear. We still have sound, though. Once it goes back into screen saver, it won't come back without restarting the whole thing. I wouldn't recommend this product until they fix the quirks."
5,"A ""Dream"" of a Compliation","This three novel compilation was totally worth the week it took me to finish reading it - and it only took a week because I had to eat, sleep, and get some work done!DREAMLAND CHRONICLES is totally worth the time and effort to read. It's full of great imagery, well developed characters, and some really groaners of puns.William Mark Simmons did a great job of combining humor and adventure in a well crafted universe that will change the way you think about virtual reality - and reality itself.It's well worth the investment of time and money."
5,Oh What A Tangled Dream,"Get a comfty chair, lots to drink and shut down all outside communication. This is a wonderful think to read. The outside world continued to interfere with the 'What next' paths of Ripley and the Dreamland Chronicles. Just when you thought you knew what path went where 'KA BOOM' the plot twisted and turned and you were off on another adventure or were you?The characters were rich with personality, charm and wit. Dastardly villians were dastardly...or were they? Beautiful women, strong men honest and true. Mythical characters of epics and lore. Even Hell in all its forms. Suspend all that you thought you knew and learn the value of Life and Living. This is a book that you schedule to read every year. Ever amazed at how fresh and exciting it continues to be. Enjoy the Adventure!"
2,"Flashy, but weak.","I bought these a show I was playing and I had one break about 4 songs in, but the other stick didn't snap for a few weeks. I think I just got a lemon. They do look pretty cool though."
3,Clay Art Antique Mug,"These are really pretty but be ready for a VERY LARGE MUG! I haven't used these as often as I thought because they are HUGE. If that doesn't present a problem for you, a great product."
1,Just a bunch of crappy re-packs,"The first few sets in this series of 4-packs were great because they had characters that could be used for army builders, newly painted droids, and decent accessories. This set is just a bunch of re-released crap. Save your money and send Hasbro a message. We know you're capable of better than this."
4,Clay Tools,My grandchildren were thrilled with these varied & colorful clay tools. Wide handles make it easier for children to get a good grip & work with the tool.
1,Through warped lenses,"Naipaul clearly has no empathy for those who long for a more spiritual existence. Without this empathy he cannot connect with the people he interviews and cannot understand their views. The only people who make any sense to him are those like himself who doubt religion and instead are turning toward the Western world as a panacea. Naipaul cannot see or hear the damage that colonialism has done to Islamic countries and Muslim people or sympathize with peoples forced to form their self-identity in the shadow of the Western world. He cannot understand what they are trying to say, he cannot hear what is not said, and he cannot read between the lines. He cannot even find insightful questions to ask! Instead he writes eloquently of his judgement, his condemnation, and his uncritical acceptance that the Western way is best.If you want to actually understand Muslims rather than simply feel superior look elsewhere."
2,"Culturally occasionally interesting, but too traveloguish","I've traveled throughout most of the world and am very familiar with the cultures Naipal describes. My hesitation on ramping this book up to a 3 or 4 starts is its slow pace and travelogue style.While he delves into various cultures, the book waxes in too much minutiae and too little plot. Writer's self-indulgence, instead of the reader's is the byword for this attempt at a good story."
1,Just plain boring!,"While I find many of the criticisms levelled against this book to be quite true, the fact of the matter is that it is just plain boring. Naipaul's tone is arrogant and pedantic. I found it impossible to finish."
2,A tedious journey,"While I learned a bit about Islam in the course of reading this book, it is a disappointing read--one of those books that starts out strong and, at too great length, peters out well before the final chapter. Toward the end I seemed to be learning more about Naipaul's opinions and biases than about his subjects.That said, the differences observed between the various Islamic countries visited are noteworthy and no less pertinent today than when the book was first released in 1981. I happened to have just read the section on Pakistan when Benazir Bhutto was assasinated, and felt I had a better historical understanding of the events surrounding her rise and fall and return and murder than I would otherwise have held."
1,A deplorable recount,"Writers share their experiences and observations of cultures, religions or civilizations in an unbiased manner, so that the readers can form their own opinions. In this book, it appears that Mr Naipaul's mission is to mock Islam and the people who practice it. He conveys an opinion about Islam in Iran after having been escorted by a man who is not a Muslim and a rebel of sorts in his own country; he conveys opnions about Islam in Pakistan after a very contained exposure, and revels on the mundane; coverage of Indonesia is highly sceptical. Snide remarks on those the Shia community revers is unwarranted. Due to the authors limited reserach and lack of interactions with a larger cross-section, the book conveys a very slanted message of Islam and the people who practice it. Much was expected from the pen of a Nobel Laurate, but it turns out to be a poor purchase."
1,This hardcover edition is a disgrace.,"I am a Naipaul fan. I am sure I will enjoy this book when I read it. However, I was so disappointed and outraged by the poor quality of this [$] hardcover edition that I feel it is important to warn other booklovers. This edition is a [waste] attempt to capitalize on Naipaul's Nobel Prize. If priced at [a lower price] I might have accepted this book as an economical, expedient way make Naipaul's work available. Bound like a library book with what looks like the cover of a paperback pasted on the front, this book,printed on the cheapest paper looks like something I'd find in a ""books for a buck"" bin.I feel cheated. Grrrrrr."
1,Save your money with this age-old canard.,"This is a book that be surrenderes to a bias from the very first sentence in the book.Mr. Naipaul, the Indian-born author, takes exception to many Islamic beliefs and allows him to fall in the trap of letting personal feelings come in the way of historical analysis.The book unfortunately is therefore corrupted from that perspective.Better bet would be to read: ""Journeys in Islamic Countries"" by John C. Bennett who unlike Naipaul isn't held hostage to his anti-Muslim passion but rather lets his impartial accounts do the talking."
3,"Religion can never fail, except of course, when it does.","In this enjoyable travelogue, set in the backdrop of late 1970's Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, Naipaul confronts a way of life that he had never given a second thought to as an intellectual, coming from a secular Hindu family in Trinidad. Although this handicaps him in some ways (e.g. he uses the word ""Sabbath"" for the Friday Ju'mah), it is also a source of some novel thoughts about Islamic ideals (insofar as they can be articulated) versus actual Muslim practice, and Islamic ""Revolutions.""In his accounts of meetings with Muslims of various levels of religiosity Naipaul attempts to understand how Islam could possibly exert a pull given its manifest failures. Although he comes to no definite answers, he does provide insight about the un-falsifiable nature of Islamic ideology (Islam didn't fail, Muslims did...). Interesament"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This video is way overpriced for what you are getting. The video quality is extremely poor and the sound quality is even worse. The content is extremely clinical, almost to the point of grossing you out.The 2-video set is basically the same concept demonstrated 2 times. If you feel compelled to check this out, buy the 1-video version, which is less expensive."
1,Deliberate Orgasm Duet,"I felt that I was terribly cheated with this video. It was $59.00 for an old, not informative, poorly done, instructional video. I would like to receive my money back!!!!"
5,The vagaries of true love,"Knut Hamsun at his finest.A brillant observer of people, with a keen eye for human emotions. This is about love,intense love.And excepting the options,with a wavering reluctance.The genius of Hamsun is that he implies so much in the most simple and humblest of styles.Excellent read.Class distiction? Love? What is one to do.Enjoy. Good Health!Happy New YearBDfExcerpts""...It was a heart's naive,fervent confession,eruptions that couldn't be held back but leaped up from the lines like stars coming out of the sky...""""...Work will force me to be calm,and in a few hours I may be cheerful again..."""
5,Staggering... Simply staggering.,"I first read Victoria five years ago. I wept like men simply aren't meant to weep. Without using ant kind of language that extends beyond three syllables Hamsun has given us possibly the most authentic, and tragic, love story of them all. I should really buy another copy, because the one I have is more akin to papier mache. Spellbinding, heart-aching and utterly wonderful."
4,The Ultimate,What I want to know is why these guys ain't getting any play. The Ultimate is the joint. Jersey holds it down.
5,"YOOOO, IF U FIND THIS particular compact disc or cassette,",COP DAT TWICE CUZ THESE NIGGAS AINT GET THEY DUE YET THAASS ALL IMMA SAY YO.
4,Substance...Not quantity,"This video is symbollic and surrealistic, to match the music that Enigma creates. I think one must remember that the video, released in 1990, probably shot and edited during 1989, was when music videos were still young, only 5 or 6 years from the start. One must reflect, that Enigma's music is best kept as a mentally created image. Although the artist experimented in this medium, Im sure they felt the resultant output vs. the creative input was not worth continued effort. I enjoyed a little window into their visual work, allthough I am happy to see they continue to produce and release beautiful musical work on a regular basis. If I had to make a choice, I'd keep things just as they are. Much is best left to the imagination.....Florescia, 2000"
5,Amazing!,"I had a different fabric shaver previously and it did not even come close to the results I get with this one. I've had mine since 2010 and I use it all the time. It makes many clothes look brand new again - and you should see what it can do on socks that have some pilling. It was out of stock for quite a while so I'm glad to see that they are making it again. In fact, I love and use this thing so much that I just ordered four more - one as backup for myself in case mine ever breaks, and one for each of my family members...it's that good!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! $10.00 at Bed Bath and Beyond!!!,"This is the most flimsy, cheap, sweater shaver I have *ever* seen, and I've had 5 of them. This is absolutely terrible. And of course I saw, two months after I bought it, that you can get it at Bed Bath and Beyond for 10/20 dollars.Rip off."
4,Very happy,I am very happy with this little shaver! I can do an entire sweater in about 10 minutes and the collection cup holds lots of fuzz.
5,Best sweater shaver you can buy,"Let's start by saying this product is expensive when compared to other shavers, but totally worth it. The large area for the shaver allows to work faster. The blades are very sharp so you have to be careful not to shave holes into your precious sweaters, just make sure that you work on a flat hard surface and the clothing item is extended. Highly recommend this product!"
4,"Overpriced, But Works Great","I was looking for a clothes shaver to get rid of unsightly lint on my fleece jacket. This clothes shaver got the job done. I've since used it on sweaters, socks, and a blanket. I do think that this item is overpriced. Also, the manual is not in English, so it's pretty useless."
5,AWESOME!,"This little machine is WICKED! IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE with it's shaving power! I have gone through two other cheap shaving machines and I'm so happy with this one! I have many sweaters because I'm in Canada, and I often have to shave them after washing. This little machine cuts shaving time by at least 1/2 - it's very fast. And if you are on top of shaving your sweaters regularly, you can just touch them up in a couple minutes. All my sweaters look BRAND NEW because of this machine! It's awesome! Worth the investment! YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS ONE!"
5,Excellent item,I purchased this directly from the seller since Amazon was out of stock. The item shipped immediately. This is far better than any other sweater shaver I've owned. This is a must for anyone wanting to preserve their favorite clothes.
4,Izumi Sweater Shaver,"Works well - ask me in a couple of years as to how this ""expensive"" item has held up over time!"
4,Generally pleased -- did well with cashmere,"As I did my research, it seemed like there was suspicion of reviews. Thought I'd leave a real one. I purchased this a few months back specificially to use on a few cashmere sweaters. I haven't used this type of thing in 20 years, but since the sweaters were expensive, I felt an investment in a fuzz thing was worth it. I'm quite happy with it -- while the sweaters don't look completely new, but they look really good. It is a very sensitive blade and gets off even small layers of fuzz. It is a bit hard to take apart for cleaning, which you need to do a lot (like after doing the front body part of a sweater or one arm). May be a bit expensive, but I'm happy."
1,Cheap Rubbish,I don't know what the below reviewers are referring to but the Izumi sweater shaver product I received was cheaply made rubbish and no better than a $5. sweater shaver you'd find at Target. Save your money for a better find.
5,This information is crucial to anyone who has children or will in the future.,"I heard about this DVD from a Russian author, Vladimir Megre. I ordered the DVD from him and watched it a while ago. It is amazing to see such freedom of thought. I hope that Americans can some day come together to create a functional education system like this."
1,"Very disappointed! Not child-size, as advertized! Poor quality! Delayed arrival! Waste of money!","I purchased these hats for a friend's toddler son's birthday present and was going to purchase one for my nephew for Christmas. I'm glad that I waited on ordering the second. My friend's were disappointed by the shipment time, quality of the material, and sizing of the hats. The hats swamped the toddler and were even big on his father's head. Very embarrassed to have given this gift. Cute idea, wrong company to buy it through."
5,Very good book!,"This was my first book by Danielle Steel, and I actually really liked it. I haven't found this kind of good book in years!"
4,Brilliant!,"Right when I first started reading this book I was drawn to it. The reason I made it a 4 is because it gets a bit slow in the middle for a short time. This mixes romance, excitement, love, family troubles, and happiness, the perfect ingredients for a good book."
3,It show how one person can die in the blink of an eye.,"This was the first book I have ever read by Steel.The first 3 chapters were wonderful and made me keep reading.By the end of those chapters it kindof slowed downand made me not want to read it anymore. Overall,it was pretty goodbut it hasn't made me read anything else by her."
4,Accident,Well again Danielle Steel is one of my all time favorite authors and I always enjoy every one of her books.
5,A sad story,"As a huge fan of Danielle Steel, I of course loved this book. It's one I have on my shelf & will probably read again in the future. It's a sad story and one that makes you think about your own life & not wasting the time that you have left."
4,great book,"This book was really good, and i found myself almost at tears at some points..Page's daughter Allison and Chole lie to their parents and want to go sneak out and meet these boys from high school. But then they get into a terrible accident, leaving Chole badly hurt and Allison almost dead.But Page's husband is not around for their daughter, and he treats page like trash, and so Page and Choles father start out this great friendship that ends it love.but in the end, it all worked out. I was so happy to find out that Page was pregnant too, it was a warm surprize. I reccomend this book to anyone."
5,"A Great Book, I recommend!...","This is one of those books you just cannot put it down. It is a great story, and remind us of how a single day can change your entire life. Tha day of the ACCIDENT is one of those days. The main characters had a perfect life before their daughter and three other teenagers were caught in a terrible car accident. After that, their lives changed in a way they had never imagine possible. To make matters worse, and if the accident by itself was not enough to drive a mother crazy, her husband had a secret he needed to share. And that was just the beginning.....It is amazing to see how their lives changed completely after that Saturday night. Is it a story of lives forever changed, courage, love and hope. I recommend this book to everyone, including teenagers. After all, the accident might had never happen if their daughters had not lied to their parents. A great book, but again, be aware you will not put it down!I recommend this book to everyone, including teenagers."
5,nynana,"This book was great. Could not put my kindle down. As usual Ms. Steel writes fantastic books. I have read most of them and look forward to future books. It is so easy to get books from Amazon. They just send it to my Kindle in a matter of seconds. Will only buy books from them. Their prices are very good too. I have purchased many things from Amazon.com. I also buy the Whirlpool ice and refrigerator filters. They are much cheaper than in the stores. Hope you all enjoy Ms. Steel's book "" Accident"" as much as I did."
4,"Good, light read. Typical Daielle Steel",This book was good but no surprises. Maybe I have read to many Danielle Steel books. I would still recommend this book for a light read.
4,Relaxation reading,"Another typical Danielle Steele, a book to relax with. I always pick up a Danielle Steele novel when I have either just finished a book that required a lot more thought or concentration, or if I just want to pick myself up from the everyday tasks that can sometimes drag you down. Her characters are believable, her story could happen to anyone. Äccident takes you into the lives of everyday people who are suddenly struck by tradgey and how each personality copes with the situation. You become part of the family and friends portrayed in the book. You come away with a feeling of positiveness and being grateful for all that you have because life can change in a split second."
4,The Title Says It All,I enjoyed this book. It was a mindless read and pretty predictable but enjoyable. A nice change from the fiction mystery's that I usually read.
5,A real page turner!!! I felt everyone of Page's emotions!!,"I could not put this book down. This was one of her best novels. You could feel every emotion Page was going through (love, hate, betrayal, and emptiness). Will there be a made for TV movie??? Please, Please!!!!!!"
2,Mediocre,I have been reading Danielle Steeles books from her early years and concider myself a lifelong fan... This story has such potential but reads too much like a fantasy. I have been through infidelity and divorce and find it hard to believe you can find happiness two weeks later? I like an escape but this seemed too shallow. Too easy. Left me unsatisfied.. A first for me as I usually find her books a great escape from reality. This one didn't work for me.
3,Not a surprise,"If you have read Danielle Steel you will not be surprised with anything in this book. Of course it starts out with the world's most perfect woman, beautiful, perfect mother, perfect wife, paints, draws, so smart, with the perfect house, husband and children, and completely unrealistic.Then of course something bad happens and they must triumph over their hardship which has shattered the most perfect of worlds.The book is not bad in any way, just so much the same as so many other books she has written. If you are looking for something new, this is not it. If you are looking for classic Danielle Steel, you will not be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"So disappointed. I usually like very much DS's books, but on this one she had very less to say. She had a subject, but after you know what it is about, she turned around for the balance of her book. All the same idea come back over and over in a difference manner............ but no development."
4,Good Book,"I read this book a long time ago, but I still think it is one of the best books that I have read. I hope you enjoy it."
4,danielle steel-accident,"the book came 2 days before the last date it said it would come in.the book came in good condition despite the fact that it said ""used""it looked pretty new just a little bent but its almost perfect"
3,"decent book, but leaves something to be desired",I wish this book were more conclusive about Allyson's fate- but I guess you can't have everything. It sure is easy to hate the husband in this book!
3,A GOOD BEDSIDE READ,PER USUAL THE SAME TEAR JERKER a GREAT WOMEN DIFFICULT HUSBAND WHO HAS A HONEY ON THE SIDE .WHO HELPING HER. MEANWHILE A GREAT GUY IN THE BACKGROUND TRYING TO HELP. AT TIMES I LIKE TO READ THESE SORRY TALES WITH GOOD ENDINGS
2,I was enormously disappointed by the lack of economic theory,"I was vaguely disappointed by the glaring absence of valid economic theory in Danielle Steel's Accident. While the story itself was filled with a certain existential isolation and angst, Steel's work overlooks a great many economic factors in this gripping, original work. For example, never once are we, as readers, privy to the financial situations of the main characters? What reference was there to the various market forces acting as the invisible hand, stabilizing the intersection of supply and demand? Is Steel simply living in a world without economics? Though her story may sizzle, the complete absence of economic theory makes this novel a true fairy tale. Ms. Steel certainly does not fill her usual role as prominent romance novelist/neo-classical economic theorist of our time."
5,Wow.,"I have not always been a big reader, most books were so boring to me that I wished that I never had to read them (or force myself to read them). Accident by Danielle Steel was very different. It actually made me want to read, and I couldn't put this book down! It was amazing, I actually felt like I was in the story and I cried in many parts of it, sometimes my crying was out of happiness. I think that the accident in the story was a great way to bring out the truth of everybody's situation. It may have brought out the worst in them, but in the end it brought out the best."
4,"Oh my Gosh, I was crying in some parts",I had never read a Danielle Steel novel and I really enjoyed it for the most part. I cried and laughed with this book.
2,Not one of her better books.,Not one of her better books. The story starts out great but then drags in the middle of it. You wish they would get to the point already! You know the outcome but have to keep waiting for the story to play out until you get to it! Not worth the time to read if you ask me.
3,Accident,Book didn't seem to move on very quickly. Not one of the better Danielle Steel books that I have read in the past.
3,Accident,"Accident was too drug out and became too boring at times but, I did not dislike it completely, so I would not recommendit to anyone who is a serious reader."
3,Good Book for reference.,"If you can't find enough quotes from Bartletts on ronald Reagan then this is a good you may need. Includes ""The Speech"" and his speech at The 1992 RNC, as well as his letter to the nation annoucing he has Altzheimers."
1,"These ""Experts"" are confused","""Government agencies and leaders in industry recognize the need to utilize hydrogen as an energy source...""This is from people who are supposed to know what they are talking about? Hydrogen is not an energy source at all. It takes energy to make hydrogen, much more than what you can ever get back with a fuel cell. Hydrogen is an energy carrier, and a very inefficient one at that.Fail. Do not waste your money."
1,this cd sucks.,"This is one of the most horrible cd I have ever heard. I just me or did it say greatest hits. bad boy never had, and will never have any greatest hits. I heard enough of this fake rap. If you want a cd i suggest you get some real rap, go trade it and gedt yoursrlf a n.w.A Eazy E or spice 1 cd. If there was a zero star choice it would get my vote all the way. over all this cd sucks BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,O.K,"It is Not as good as Deathrow's greatest hits.he miss out on alot of track with Madd Rapper Interludes.He could had made it better buy something eles like All Eyez on Me,Ready to Die.Because this is a waste."
5,Excellent selection of Pound's poems,"This book is a very good introduction to the work of Ezra Pound. There's a little bit of everything! You get some of his earlier, shorter poems, like ""In a Station of the Metro,"" some translations, like ""The Seafarer,"" or ""Homage to Sextus Propertius,"" the famous Mauberley sequence (this book includes both the ""original"" poem ""Hugh Selwyn Mauberley"" and Pound's later poem ""Mauberley"" whereas most books reprint only the earlier poem), and, of course, some of the cantos.I'm pretty sure that Pound made the selections for this edition himself, though the editor adds a few cantos. Ezra Pound's work is exciting and really important for poets writing today. It's impossible to see how we got to where we are now without reading Ezra Pound."
1,Yama Moto Yama,"Not sure if I was sent a substitute brand different from what others have reviewed, but the packaging is different - brand name is Yama Moto Yama. The product is very difficult to eat, not crispy, and definitely not flavorful. I love seaweed salad and most flavored seaweed products I've tried, but this is inedible in my opinion."
5,History that no one tells,this is an amazing book that seems to tell a different history than what we have been told in school every one should read this.
1,Is this still in print?,"I find it hard to believe that this book is still in print. Poorly written, poor history, a ""feel good"" book for people without any background in, or knowledge of, history. Ask yourself why he hasn't used any sources from later than the late 1950's (and most of them from the 19th century). Because advance in archaeology make a mockery of his argument? Yes."
5,It's True,For all those who doubt the facts stated in this book. I suggest doing a google search on the Lemba people of Zimbabwe.
5,GREAT,The best book on black history! Better than any history textbook or class lecture! This wealth of information is godly!
1,"Another Attempt at ""Blackenization""","This book is yet another attempt by Black people in America suffering from the ""forget"" syndrome. Due to our being cut off from our true past through the enslavement era we have become aloof to what our true aidentity is. In light of that, the reclamation efforts of many of the so-called ""scholars"" have overlooked our obvious West Afrikan bearings. Thus, this book attempts to promulgate, without any real proof, a pseudo ""Black Hebrew: ideology. I give it one star because it does provide one or two historical facts that can help the neophyte."
1,Pure Fantasy - don't shelve with History,"Yet another decidedly unscholarly attempt to falsify the record of the past and make history a tool of propaganda, beset with fantasy and illusion. Pure garbage formed ex nihilo, like Black Athena, sprung perfectly formed and armored from a Black Zeus. There is real and honest African history out there folks, and it doesn't have to co-opt, borrow or steal from other civilizations to be validated."
2,"Poorly written, a difficult read. Find another book !!!","Where do I begin?? Simply put, this book is written poorly. Trust me, I am not anti african history. It's just that the book has the feel of a high school term paper. The content of the book is presented in an unconvincing fashion. The author goes into first person to third person, makes references to non-existent sources. Very bad. I agree that there is a rich history to be uncovered for those seeking to learn about the black influence on world history. This book could turn many people off from that search. Don't let it happen to you. Read ""The Story of the Moors in Spain"" by Stanley Lane-Poole, for example. Read ""African Origins of Civilization"" by Cheikh Anta Diop. There are many other books that can provide adequate references and make for a better read."
3,from Babylon to Timbuktu,"this book is informative and is in great detail of the flight of the original black jews .its a good book but can shady on certain times in history.it also speaks of the in slavement of the black jews all across the world witch is mentioned in Deut chapter 28.it also talks about how the residencs of Ghana,Mali, and othere places in Africa are related to the jews of Africa American that set up nation to this day. its good but not an excelllent one went"
3,no expectations,"This is the first book by Catherine Palmer that I've read and it was given to me as a gift. I had no expectations at all. It was very nicely written and I enjoyed the character on Nicolai. He is very heartwarming and the epitome of the scripture ""out of the mouth's of babes"". I enjoyed the ""twist"" somewhere in the middle of the story. It made the story-line move faster. It started to drag on in the romance part of it. Overall, I was pleased with this book and I would highly consider reading other books by this author."
3,a good book,"This book has a little bit of everything--romance, loss, backstabbing gossip, secrets that are finally revealed and inspiration. Elizabeth must decide to come out of her comfortable existence and face the rest of the world...Zachary helps her by forcing her to confront the present. Little Nick is a hoot all throughout this book--the innocence of the young is truly a remarkable thing.There were parts, now that I am done reading it that were predictable, but while you are reading it, you don't necessarily realize it.A good book, and I would recommend it for an easy escape."
1,Trite,"When one decides to read a Christian book one can expect religion to be a major player, and so I was not offended at all by the frequent references to Christ. However, I found the book to be extremely trite. Those ""lovable"" characters just seemed contrived and over the top to me. The kid was like a fairy tale, never fussy and always cute with his Malaprop tendencies; just a bit of a stretch to really believe this was a true child. The heroine was a real turn-off. For most of the book she was preachy and opinionated - telling the hero to ""surrender"" to God's will but failing to do just the same until way later in the book. When she did, she immediately became a whole lot more likable! Frankly I forced myself to read until the end just so I could write a review. It's not the Christian aspect that turned me off - on the contrary I've read a few of this sort and really have liked them. But the characters in this book failed to engage my imagination and my empathy."
3,More like 2 1/2 Stars,"I didn't realized when getting this book (for free I add) that it was from Tyndale Publishing and therefore a religious romance. That in itself would not have deterred me m getting it at all, I have read other books and they were good. I kind of liked this one and I at some points forced myself to keep reading it because I must say it had lots of funny moments and the story was OK. The way the characters kept mentioning Jesus was too much (in my opinion)and turned me off many many times. Although most charactes ended up doing something about their problems it seemed to me kind of a simple way to look at things. I am a mom and didn't like much how Liz said that the most important thing for her was her faith and second being a mom."
3,"OK book, but wouldn't recommend.","This was a book that I downloaded because it was free and it was in the genre that I love. However, I found this book disappointing. Although it was touted as a Christian fiction, it was so much more preach-y than the majority of the other Christian fictions I've read, that it could more appropriately be called ""really long boring sermon"" fiction. I swear, if the word ""surrender"" was used one more time, I was going to hurl the book across the room. I always finish books I start, so I was bound to finish it, but I can't say it was worth the read. It was an alright story, but it didn't really captivate me. Unfortunately, I kept waiting for the end to come around. I really hate to say it... but I'm glad I didn't waste money on it."
2,Finders Keepers - you can keep it!,"I got bored with this after a few chapters. Very twee, simplistic and predictable. Not my cup of tea I'm afraid."
2,A very Christian story,"Had I been looking for a Christian story, I would have been very happy with this book. As it was, I wasn't. I enjoyed the sweet storyline, outside of the ""surrender to God's will""part. There were many aspects of this book I found nice, but I had a very hard time with the constant proselytization."
2,A little boring,"At first I liked the story, but after a while I just wanted it to actually progress a little. Come on, I felt like saying, ""Give it a rest."" I normally don't mind reading Christian books, but it was a little over the top. It was a very predictable read; not much in the way of unexpected twists. I kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately I didn't like it much. I probably won't read any from this author again."
4,"Really enjoyed it, Easy read!",I really enjoyed this book! I loved the story line and read it quickly. I love Christian fiction and I definitely recommend it!
4,"Easy read, Enjoyable!","I like to read all types of books, this book is a bit preachy, but if you are really into christan books then this is a book for you."
2,Very Blah,"I tend not to read religious fiction but every so often I download a free one and am able to skip over the references and find a good story underneath. That is not the case here. The book is way too wordy and preachy. I gave it two stars is for the cute kid, which was the only reason I kept reading. I found myself skipping through parts of it to see if anything exciting happened. Nope. Unrealistic as well in several parts-first, it is unrealistic to have a marriage proposal after one kiss and zero dates, that's not how real life and 99% of books are. Additionally, there are parts of the book where the main character's maternal skills are questionable.I wouldn't download it unless it's free and then, only if you have nothing else to read."
4,Love it,wow. I'm glad I got a kindle now because I've been having all these great reads lately. Amazing. This book is def something I will be reading again. At first I was iffy about the constant use of dialogue but it was so engaging. I loved it.
3,decent read,I like this book and the story behind it. I did find it difficult to read because of the MANY references to religion and God. I normally don't mind when a book references something like that but with this book I kind of felt that the author was shoving it down your throat while also trying to tell a story at the same time. Overall though it is a good book.
4,Delightful read!,"I enjoyed this book very much. The little boy was adorable, had me smiling the whole time and the subject matter (surrendering) is something I, myself, have been dwelling on recently so it really hit home. There was a part or two that was a tad bit slow for me but will still be looking into the sequel!"
2,Which country is this about?,"This is a poor DVD. Hitler's English voice sounds Japanese, the speaker for a German witness sounds Russian, and not a single voiceover has a German accent.This is a typical British bias on the war. I should have known what kind of video this would be, since it's from the makers of ""Britain at War in Colour."" It's over the top for sensationalism and not even close historically.The only reason for this DVDs existance is to see color video of WWII. Do yourself a favor and keep it on mute while you watch it.I bought my copy for $5 USD. It's worth that, but not much more."
5,History of a nut,There were many pictures I had never seen before and in color it was more like really being there in that time in history.
2,Disappointing,"I found the narrator less ""gripping"", as one reviewer stateshere, than heavy handed with a laughable accent--sounded like a cross between Dracula and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The narration is actually very boring and uninformative. I give this two stars because it does have some color footage I have not seen before."
1,Small and cheap,It's way smaller than we thought it was going to be. And it's kind of cheap looking.
1,ZERO Stars(not really one),"This Joystick sucks hard. We bought it and it doesn't even work with windows xp aight. This thing constantly isn't working, so it basically just collects dust. It is like super light weight and just feels weird when your movin it around. I am super bored and am writing reviews for the first thing i look at in this room. Trust me though, don't buy this joystick!"
5,Ron Howard Rules!!Great Actor/Director!!,"This is a great A&E Biography of the reknowned actor/director Ron Howard.Ron,we all love you!!"
1,Punk????,"OK, why you even think about putting the word punk on this CD? It seems that if you have a little whiny voice and can scream every so often like a little girl then you can call yourself punk...In all it is nothing more than EMO crap! And that is mostly what this CD is comprised of, except for the likes of BR, Pennywise, The Disasters and DKM, this CD is awful.Do yourself a favor and stick with the first five releases of Punk-O-Rama and let's hope in the future that when Epitaph releases a CD with the word ""punk"" in it you are getting what you pay for."
1,Enough Emo,"This is the worst Punk o Rama yet. Bad Religion is the last respectable aspect of epitaph, and that is an old song. These albums getworse and worse. Do yourself a Huge favor pick up any of the first four volumes of Punk o Rama, Because thats the only way you're going to hear true punk Rock."
5,Lost genre,"It is sad to say that the punk genre is lost, and it warms my soul to see a comp full of the greats. Not to mention unreleased goods I've never heard. I haven't picked up Punk-o-rama since 3 and I'm super glad I picked this one up. If you only picked this one up for Offspring your a retard. Why pick up a comp for only one band? You should pick this up because of NoFX, Bouncing Souls, Hot water music, Bad Religion etc... a whole list of GREAT bands! Not to mention ""The Coup"" a early 90's rap group who instead of preaching gang-bang rapped about opening your mind.I suggest everyone go pick up Operation Ivy's ""Energy"" and get back to what punk is all about! Unity"
3,"I'm sorry, but was the below ""review"" really a review? Or just some idiot trying to sound smart?","I feel just the same as all you that wish the Punk-O-Rama series was cooler and actually put some Punk stuff on their CDS. But honestly, I gave up on this compilation series long ago.Just stick to buying the artists CDS.3 stars for the effort of Epitaph to make some more money. Go figure."
3,SO-SO,"I like only a few of the bands on here, And i don't really care for emo, But converge was pretty cool."
1,f.uck epitaph,This is awful. About as punk as Kylie Minogue.The only band that can save epiatph records is Death by Stereo. And they arent even on this disc.Go to hell Gueruwitz and epitaph records
1,Buy Depeche Mode instead,"What does it matter if you get 26 songs for 5 bucks when all the songs suck? Since many people here are having trouble finding good music, I suggest they all go out and buy a Depeche Mode album. No matter what music genre you prefer, everyone has a fave DM song. Sure, they ain't Punk, but it's amazing music. Get Ultra, Music for the Masses SOFAD, Violator, Black Celebration. Hell, get any DM album instead of this sorry excuse for music. If you're strapped for cash, you can buy DM singles for just $5.99, and oftentimes you get up to ten b-sides as well as the single song."
2,DIGIMON ROCKS THIS CD!!!!!!!!,"Im a huge fan of Digimon. But not this cdAgumon, Gatomon, And Patamon rock way harder then this. Were is Dillinger Escape Plan or The Locast..... At least they put Converge here. Most of other songs are third rate songs that were not good for any album.... Then again to don't like some of the bands here"
1,Buy an REM album instead,"Anyone who bashes Depeche Mode has no taste in music. In fact, anyone who likes this bullsh*t Punk music has no taste in music. DM are a classic band, and everyone has a fave DM song. Ever heard ""Enjoy the Silence"", ""Never Let Me Down"", ""Personal Jesus"", ""Just Can't Get Enough"", or ""It's No Good""? Do you own Music for the Masses, Violator, and Black Celebration? If not, you can't call yourself a music fan. Manny_Moses, what's your fave DM song? Oops, Manny_Moses likes The Used. What a sh*tty druggie band.Just buy a Depeche album. Perhaps if you own all Depeche Mode's records, might I suggest a REM album? Yes, I will. Buy REM's Monster and Automatic for the People as well"
5,This is what you need in your cd library next...,"I'd give this cd 10 stars, but amazon.com only lets you give 5 stars. If you are looking for a new band to get into, then look no further than Water School. Their influences (Neil Young, Gram Parsons, Wilco,etc) should be enough to tell you that this cd will rock your socks off, especially if you're a fan of Alt. Country. I bought a used copy for really cheap and fell in love with it and then bought a copy from the band'sofficial website ([...]) just so I could support them. I then saw them play at the Ottobar in Baltimore and they sound amazing live and bought another copy of their cd from them to give to my friend as a birthday gift. I suggest picking this up immediately. Put your money towards this cd instead of buying the new cd by the Sex Slaves called ""Bite Your Tongue""."
1,disappointed on condition,"I have not purchased on the used side before and probably won't again. This book was purchased for my daughter for Christmas and I am disappointed in the yellowed pages, it looks like someone found it in their attic. I don't even feel that it's worth the used price."
5,One book I love,"This book is really awesome...try it and I assure you want to read it over and over again! It's mostly for them who likes romance and you can be very frightened some times..From A Girl In Sweden,which means that our book is translated to swedish but it's still great!"
4,Definitely recommend this book.,This book is a very easy read and is the perfect book for a quick break.
5,Works fine,"Simple, exactly fits the 4"" PVC and the standard 2"" X 3"" downspout. There's not much more that can be said."
5,Great value,I shopped around and purchased a similar adapter at Lowes only to find out that I was not satisfied with it so I returned it. I found these on Amazon so I gave it a shot and ordered several. Once they arrived I loved how the corners were radiused to hug the gutter...these adapters are superior and far less expensive than Lowes or Home Depot!
4,Quilting Gloves,"I found them pretty good. I am just starting to learn machine quilting, but have been hand quilting for thirty years.Since I am a novice at this I found them a little bulky in the finger tips, but that may be because I am not used to working with gloves in this area. Otherwise, they seem of good quality."
4,safety gloves,"i bought these for safety and they alright and they do help keep your hand for slipping. However, they are really light weight. i finally bought some of the heavy duty slip proof Ove Gloves. They would protect my hands better from a slip of the blade. However, Ove Gloves are bulky and so I use these gloves when I teach sewing classes because they take up little room in my travel case."
4,A good overview,This book is clear and easy to read. It presents an authoritavie overview of high blood pressure and what to do about it. The author seems to know what he is talking about and gives sound advice. Recommended.
4,¿Por qué no podemos vivir como él?,"Este disco es una buena selección de una de las épocas del grupo y no deja de ser una suerte poder escuchar temas como ""Lunita de lejos"", uno de los mejores del grupo, para mi gusto, en la mejor voz de Quilapayún, la del trágicamente desaparecido Willy Oddó. Pero yo quería aprovechar para manifestar mi rabia por haber sido incapaz de encontrar el más mínimo rastro de su cantata ""Vivir como él"", a pesar de que soy fan del grupo desde hace 25 años y no les he perdido la pista en ningún momento. ¡Lo que daría por una grabación de ese disco! Y ¿por qué tampoco se reedita una de sus mejores selecciones, ""La marcha y la bandera""? Paciencia. Acaba de salir la cantata ""La fragua"", que era inencontrable desde hace una eternidad. No perdamos la esperanza. Jose G. Ortega. jgonza20@pie.xtec.es"
2,What was that?,"Betrayel of the Dove is a confusing, if not dizzying movie of a young divorced mother who is betrayed by her ex-husband,new lover, and best friend. As the three of them plot to kill her, the story becomes more of a montage of confusion and delirium rather than a fluid movie telling a story. Filled with flashbacks and confusion, I certainly can not recommend it-even to my worst enemy."
1,"Helen: good, movie: bad","For any one who is a fan of Helen Slater, for ten bucks, this movie should be in their collection. One definitely gets lots of the Slater magic. Additionally, there are quite a few other ""second tier"" stars that make it fun.However, be warned. The VHS tape is recorded at SLP (slowest speed), so the visual quality is awful. The story and direction are very poor as well, and the sound direction is horrendous. The switches between ADR, Foley, and live sound are jarring at times, and the overall audio mix is almost upsetting. But, I'm still glad to have it just for Helen."
2,Betrayal of the Dove betrays audience!,"I remeber watching this movie about 7 years ago, and I really didn't like it at all! I wanted to watch it first off because Helen Slater is one of my favorite actresses of all, and I thought she did a wonderful job with her performance! But the whole movie itself is too psychological and depressing that after seeing it 2 or 3 times, you really don't want to see it again! My compliments to Helen though for doing her best with this movie! She's as beautiful as she is talented!"
2,supernatural blah.,"despite it's alluring cover artwork,i really did not like this. it's about a centuries old house,devil worship,real or imagined? hallucinations(i'm still not sure ""what"" this was),etc.i tend not to like the ones like this involving the supernatural. perhaps another reader might get more out of it? sorry but,only two stars."
1,Not OEM product,"The product delivered (from Battery Center) isn't an OEM Dell charger, but a non- UL listed cheap generic charger. You can't wrap the cord up like the OEM product, the cord is short, and when you move around with the laptop you have to lift the (much larger) brick."
4,Great Read,"As an avid true crime reader, this book was right down my lane. The writing was great and there was in depth detail of all involved. It was very easy to get wrapped up in the story. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to read a sad true crime event that could have been prevented."
4,Nice addition to my Kindle library. I am always appreciative of the free book offerings for my Kindle. Thank you!,Nice addition to my Kindle library. I am always appreciative of the free book offerings for my Kindle. Thank you!
5,I Couldn't Put It Down!,"Bad Karma is a real page turner. The author tells the true story of a romantic obsession that moves inexorably toward tragedy. The role played by each of the characters in the developing drama is explored in a way that is absolutely gripping, and the story telling is dynamic. Transfixed by the weaving together of personalities and events, I found myself reading straight through the night."
5,Very readable,"When your high-school-aged son willing picks up this book which was sitting on the coffee table, reads it, and tells you that it helped him understand the ""why"" behind the math, it has to be good. I plan to read it too. I would like to conquer my fear of math."
2,not the best,the shackle lock with gate door are good ideas. the only problem I had with this lock is that it is terrible in the rain. once the dials on the front get wet the numbers won't turn as well and the latch door is tough to move. if exposed to more weather eventually it wears out. I used it for about 7 months and it had to be discarded because it was too tough to explain to people how to get the door open. if you aren't worried about water than it probably will be great for you.
1,"Purchased two, both failed immediately.","I purchased two locks and both of them managed to fail almost immediately. The first one unlocked on factory settings, but the moment I had set my own code it failed and wouldn't open again. Sadly, we had already put a key in it which meant that I had to break into the Shurlok. 10 minutes with a screwdriver and hammer and I had it busted wide open, hardly secure."
4,Works Great,"Simple to use and sturdy. No problems so far, using it for contractors and workers coming and going while doing a remodel on our house."
1,Not what I wanted,"I purchased this to hide an extra key on my Ford Excape, but the lock is to small to hold the larger Auto keys. It will work fine for a house key."
3,Product is temperamental,The purchase and order experience meet expectation. The product however is tricky. Sometimes the door opens and sometimes it doesn't. The wheel is sticky and tough to turn after some time in the elements. This is supposed to be an outdoor product.
2,Doesn't fit our key,"We ordered this lockbox to store one of our house keys. We have unusual ""skeleton"" high security keys, which are slightly longer than a regular key by a few milimeters. It doesnt fit the key we have, so it is completely useless to us."
3,"Before you buy this lock, you should know this...","I just bought this lock and was planning on using it at various rental houses. My plan was to set the shackle code to a number I could easily remember, and then set the key storage combo to the four numbers from the address of whatever property I had it placed on so this code could also be easily remembered. However, what I found (and I'm surprised that no one has mentioned this yet), is that you can choose EITHER a custom code for the shackle OR a custom code for the key storage area -- but not BOTH.The reason is that if you pick a custom 4-digit combo for the shackle, then your combo for the key storage area will automatically be set to a pre-determined code. Or vice-versa. However, you will not be able to custom choose two different codes for the shackle and key storage area.The lock still functions fine so far, but I would have liked to have known about this code-setting issue before making my purchase."
4,lock box product review,"Product arrived, one new and one used. I followed the instructions in the new one and the used one is working fine. Units without instructions will be difficult to figure out unless you are familiar with how to install codes. I must remember not to use regular shipping as it took forever to arrive (not the seller's fault). I am happy with this purchase."
4,Does the trick and at a right price,I bought this to hold a couple of keys for out of town visitors and it works just like it's supposed to. The only thing standing in the way of a 5 star review is the fact that the numbers really only scroll one way. It's very difficult to get them to go down but they go up just fine.
3,Shurlock Lock Box,Ordered 2 and one was faulty. I am about to return it to the factory and I am hoping that they will stand behind it and send me a replacement.
3,"Pretty boring, nothing new here.",This film was largely boring. Nothing unique or new happened that has not been done in films before. The story was overly simplistic and did not feature enough detail to make the viewers care.
3,sadly disappointed,"Just didn't live up to either Alien nor Aliens, but the others didn't as well. Characters were just not believable."
2,Underwhelmed...,"A prequel to the Alien series??? Not even near the same league. I guess it answers where the Creatures came from - sorta; but, it creates many more questions and leaves them unanswered. The cast did a credible job; but, they didn't have much of a story or script to work with. In short, I didn't find this movie appealing as a standalone or prequel. As a fan of the Alien series, I'm sorta sorry that I watched it."
2,Disappointing,"I'm in the camp that was disappointed by this movie. It was derivative and lacked cohesion. Some parts of the script were atrocious, as was some of the acting. Maybe the effects would have redeemed it somewhat on the big screen, but on the small screen it is entirely missable."
2,Disappointing,"This was such a disappointment from Ridley Scott. Characters and script were weakly developed, the narrative twists seemed either completely predictable or utterly opaque. You know you are in trouble when your most (indeed, the only) interesting and nuanced character isn't even human. Not a memorable line in the film. Expected so much more."
1,hard to follow,could not tell what was going on in this movie. script was bad and had no plot or anyt kind of continuity
3,movie,This movie is an okay movie but I couldn't not get this for the collection. Not bad of a movie
3,Prequel,I've watched this movie several times and still can't understand the connection to the alien series. This is a movie I'd relegated to background noise for those of us who need it.
2,wasnt as interesting as i thought,The preview to this movie made it seem more exciting but it was boring! The only thing I found interesting was the big guy...
2,Disappointing!,"I have come to expect so much more from Ridley Scott. The story is weak, and predictable, the acting is mediocre, the dialogue is tortured. Really wish he hadn't bothered."
2,A let down..,"Great special affects but that was about all in this movie prequel to the Alien story. The story line was predictable and dumb. I liked the original Alien movies, especially the second ""Aliens"" as the suspense was great. This movie was a let down in my expectations and it seemed too short and fragmented. The actions of the characters was stupid and nonsensical in the way they did things. Poor directing in my opinion, shame on you Ridly Scott! I expected something more then this 3rd rate attempt."
2,A weak prequel to Alien,"Film directors should avoid all temptation and stop making prequels. Star Wars Episode 1-3 were lackluster and Prometheus is even worse. Were you really spending the past three decades wondering about the Engineer and where the Aliens came from? It's here, but you could have been told in 10 minutes. The script is deadly dull and I didn't really care about any of the characters. Compare that to the original Alien where I liked the entire crew and hated to see them get picked off. I was so bored in the final scenes I fell asleep."
1,"bad, bad, bad",what a let down. Showed such promise in the trailers. I should have believed the reviews I read. Very disappointed.
2,Poor Script With Cool Special Effects/Graphics,"The best thing the movie has going for it is an interesting futuristic look. The script is awful. I kept stopping the film to complain to my wife about the constant moronic choices the ""scientists"" and ""explorers"" were making. Don't waste your money!!!!"
3,Just okay,"We expected more from this movie. The previews make the movie look interesting, and it was, but it still left something to be desired. The biggest disappointment was the ending...kinda stupid."
3,prometheus,Have watched the blue-ray version several times. Suddenly the disc started sticking at the beginning of the movie. The odd thing is that only the visual portion is stuck. The audio continues to play while the visual is stuck at the beginning of the movie . Not impressed !
5,Visually satisfying! Story......,"First, I saw every Alien movie. Second, I am not an expert in videography or related, nor a screenwriter. The reasons for viewing the preceding movies were just I wanted to view them for the action and so called horror. I knew generally what to expect. But Prometheus was something else. My associates at work kept talking about the movie explaining questions arrising from the previous releases....Okay so I rented the previous movies again. But there was not one that I really cared about to be answered. I guess I did not think the movies were portals to find a understanding of our existence. Prometheus was very entertaining and I felt tried to appease both parties ( god believing and atheist) about creationism- sorry but I did mention I am not a writer.I liked it though but did not view it to try to find any type of answers. Even now I have trouble recalling the main characters in the movies."
2,Could have been better,The story was intriguing but the movie was not well executed. At times it was slow and boring. The story ends with the viewer wanting more.
3,Meh....,"Visually, this was a stunning film with adequate to very good acting. Unfortunately, the story leaves you wanting. Some would call it predictable, but I can live with predictable as long as the film making allows me to immerse myself into the environment. Too many questions were raised that remain unanswered (and I don't think it was deliberate) and the action scenes could have been delivered by phone.Michael Fassbender's androidal take of Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia is goose bump inducing.And kudos to the film for the fastest recovery from a self-inflicted abdominal laparotomy I've ever seen. [insert eyeroll]"
2,"Disappointed! Acting a little stale, expected more of lead actress Noomi.","The acting was certainly stale. The CGI wasn't what I expected of Ridley Scott. The plot absolutely didn't seem to follow Alien; as a prequel at least. The best acting I saw was from lead actress Rapace and even her performance in this film didn't seem like here. She was definitely not on top of her game in this film, nothing like the Millennium Trilogy where I felt like she really hit her stride. There was little to no character development similar to the ""run and gun"" feel of a late Rambo movie. The movie had a very ""scripted feel for me. This film pales in comparison to Scott's older work. Especially the CGI, the part I expected to be the best, seemed beneath him. There was just way too many plot holes and bad acting for me to enjoy the movie. I'm glad it was free because I would not have been happy spending money to watch this flick."
4,good movie,This is a good movie for fans of sifi and suspensful movies and the alien films. And overall good movie.
2,yawn!!!,Rather boring as far as sci-fi space travel stuff goes.Would be a great saturday morning cartoon show.Sounded loke a good premis but not well executed.
2,dont wast your time,dont wast your money and i have to write this just to make up the word requirement ta da da
2,Had its moments,"The promos for this looked amazing, so we rented it. But the actual movie has some weird editing and continuity problems. Scenes just sort of end, and drop off a cliff somewhere. Glad we didn't pay money to see it in a theater."
2,"I like Scifi a lot, but too many things were wrong here","Examples - the extreme mismatch in crew personalities, the huge space inside of the spaceship, the lack of hazmat for the alien head, getting lost when they had extreme GPS capability."
4,Was ok,It was an OK movie! Plot was a little show and special effects were ok as well. I saw on big screen. When first came out.
4,prom,i watched this a while ago and can't really remember all of it. i think i liked it. end of review
5,Awesome,This is one fantastic movie. It has the viewer asking so many questions and waiting for the next movie to come out and explain the why.
4,Good movie.,I liked this movie despite all the bad reviews. It was entertaining and had a decent story. Overall I'd say it was well worth the $3.99 rental. I'll wait until it gets cheaper before I buy it but I will add it to my collection eventually.
2,Prometheus,"It was not Alien, but the comparisons are probably unfair. As a film in it's own right it was ok, but not one that stuck with me afterwards. That's my main ""test"" for whether a movie is special to me. It can have all the great acting and all the great effects in the world, but if it's not still on my mind the next day, it's a three star at best."
2,Prometheus Review,To many plot holes and unanswered questions. Some situations were very silly and unbelievable. I hope the next installment makes more sense.
2,Alien it Ain't,"A spaceship of supposedly intelligent people making stupid decision and wind up getting dead -- makes for a boring couple of hours. This film had none of the tension, mood, and grit of Scott's Alien. At the end, you're left wondering what it was about and if there was a point to the whole thing. There are several unresolved plot points as well."
3,PROMETHEUS REVIEW,IDEA WAS GOOD BUT NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED FURTHER. ACTING WAS THIN AND PLOT TOO THIN FOR THIS LENGTH OF MOVIE.
3,meh,Overall it was an interesting seague into the Alien mythos but it would've been better if we were given more backround about the Engineers.
2,Seen it twice,"I've seen this movie twice, once in theaters and once with a friend that insists it's good. And both times, it really feels like 3 good movies that were cut into third and put together. I mean, it has three good acts, but they don't mesh at all. The characters go from fact based scientists to crazy eyed explorers that throw caution to the wind, to stoic warriors.If Ridley wanted to write a epic, he should have done it with the Alien series. Not tried to reboot with this..."
3,Movie was just OK..,"PROMETHEUS is a prequel to the first ALIEN movie from 1979.. The special effects are very good, however there was not enough scenes with the aliens in the movie and the whole storyline about trying to find the ""ENGINEERS"" who created the human race was far-fetched and not very believable..If you are a fan of the ALIENS movies though, I would recommend renting this movie..3 out 5 stars.."
2,Dumb,I guess if you liked alien then go for it. The whole thing was one disaster after another and it wasn't pretty lol. I felt like the actual story was a little weak.
2,"Fairly mediocre revision of Alien; like original, first half is way too slow","People overhyped this movie. It's got good effects, sets. and atmosphere but it takes far to long to get going and so is similar to the original in a negative way."
3,More questions.....,"Less answers than you would expect. While I was hoping this would give more insight to the aliens as a whole, and to the history of the aliens universe. It leaves more questions than answers and for it to fit perfectly into the aliens universe there has to be a part two. There's no question about that. Even though it's a (first half it seems) prequel it left far more questions than answers. Did it answer what the aliens are, yes. Did it answer how they got to their current form? no and when you compare face huggers you'll know that it has a long way to go. Overall it was ok. But I was satisfied with one watch of it."
5,Watch Alien Before This!!!,"I KNOW THIS IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE A PREQUEL BUT IT SURE SEEMS LIKE ONE. ESPECIALLY IF YOU WATCH ALIEN BEFORE OR AFTER SEEING THIS, THE FIRST HALF HOUR IS EXACTLY THE SAME DESIGNS AND EVERYTHING. I KNOW THE DIRECTOR SCOTT SAID NO TO BEING A PREQUEL, BUT U CANNOT WATCH THIS MOVIE AND TELL ME IT IS NOT A PREQUEL. IT IS A GREAT MOVIE AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT. I HAVE WATCHED IT NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE BUYING IT AND IT PULLS ME IN EVERYTIME. THIS IS A MUST OWN JUST LIKE THE ALIEN FRANCHISE. CANT WAIT FOR PART 2."
3,SCI 5 imagination with karma,"It was far fetched but how karma bites back. Aliens, travel, sick worked mind control, and the skill to survive wrapped up with KARMA."
3,"Nice 3D, very average movie",I bought this movie for the 3D which is pretty cool. But overall the movie is very averageand fits badly with the alien franchise/timeline. Near the end the story goes completelyoff the rails. Could have been way better.
3,"Waited... for this ""Disappointed ""","something inside ,said ""wait until this movie goes to disk"" so I did I omg I was right ....lame story,bad acting....story was slow,I still don't no what the story was about..........someone had to tell me......"
3,Started Out Okay,"The film began well and the plot looked promising. There was some foul language that really didn't need to be there. Hollywood, why do you always assume that filthy language adds something to a film? Halfway into the film, however, it became apparent that is was simply a remake of the Alien films. That's all good and fine, but the film lost the original mystique of the premise implied by the opening of the plot. It was pretty well done, but there were also some pretty unbelievable scenes as well. Could have been better had they developed the concept alluded to at the beginning."
2,Not worth it,I had high hopes for this movie but was very disappointed. The storyline was weak and boring. Save your time and money!
3,Could have been better,Disappointing as it could and should have been a better movie production. The story line was very poor and the acting marginal.
3,Could have been great.,"Obviously it is setting us up for another prequel; it presents more questions than it answers. I went into this movie with a good attitude so it would not have been hard to make me really like it. This movie badly needed a Ripley. With the possible exception of the Engineer, there was not a single character of which I regretted their demise."
3,An entertaining movie,"This is definitely not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made. But it's also certainly not the worst. I found it entertaining with enough going on to keep me intellectually tuned-in. The ending leave a big unnecessary hole for a sequel so there are some loose ends that I would have preferred get addressed. All-in-all, I'm glad I waited for it to come out on video but not disappointed that I watched it."
5,Even better the second time,I saw Prometheus in the theater and was blown away. When I watched it the second time I noticed more details than I did the first time. It's is going to be one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. The picture quality was great and the sound was fantastic.
2,Prometeus,"Another Alien movie. Ugh Same old story. Monstor saves Mother. Would definitely NOT recommend. Boring, uninteresting and just a rip off."
2,blah,"Just didn't really do it for me. The effects were fine, but that is about all good I can say about the movie. I don't really know why the big bald guys wanted to kill the humans other than everything wants to kill humans."
3,Hyped up.,"The movie trailers and teasers made me really want to watch this movie. But, I was disapointed in the actual movie. Come on, you travel thousands of light years to research our beginnings and you don't bring military flood lights for the big scary cave...things that make you go hmmmm. Most of the action scenes were ok. Really not impressed overall."
4,Not bad,I thought this was pretty good. There was enough intensity and adventure to keep me interested. I thought the quality of the acting and cinematography was very good. Story is a little weak but I thought it was worth seeing.
3,very strange,"The 3D disc worked very well. NOT ONE GHOST! Plenty of depth and resolution but not enough ""pop-out"" for my taste. The story is good; the acting OK. Noomi, however, is GREAT!! Because of all the dark scenes the 3D black acuity wasn't that great on my TV. The sound is great on my system.The DVD version is excellent vis a vis the colors. My receiver did the 1080i to 1080p upscaling very well.BUT:This is the second package. I returned the first one because the BluRay version had freezes and droupouts on one BD player, and took an age to load. The same BD version did not even load on my other (3D) BD player. The BluRay disc from my second package corrupted my BD player something awful and I will not even attempt to load it again."
2,"Long, slow, and anticlimactic.",I couldn't wait for it to be over and in the end I felt like it was a waste of my time and money. This is supposed to be the prelude to Aliens which didn't really emerge until the last quarter of the story. Character and set design was pretty good but the amount of action and adventure didn't meet my needs.
2,Not what I expected.,"I love all the ""Alien"" movies, and I have to tell you that this one is not one of them. Maybe as a separated story will be fine, but the fact that it has being related to the first one makes it a complete fiasco.Yes the special effects are good, and some of the actors have a very nice performance, but the way the story was handle is wrong. They should watch the first movie one more time before they made this one. On the first one there were eggs with those nasty ""hands"" we all love. On this one they have pods with some black goo stuff that does not add any suspense to the film.The big alien with the broken chest was found inside their ship sitting on the control chair, not inside a human vessel next to a squid like creature.I could understand all the discrepancies if the creator of Prometheus was some one else. But this is not the case.In any way this movie is not what it claims to be.I am really disappointed."
3,"""Alien"" meets ""Species,"" ""The Thing"" and ""Contact""...","...but not as good as any of those movies. More androids working for evil corporations, acid-spewing monsters and flame throwers. Give it up Ridley...or go work for SyFy channel cause this is nothing more than a high-budget made-for-tv scifi channel movie. If you like those movies, you'll love this. But for me it was totally un-scary...except for the disgusting surgery scene. (Scott at his best.) The rest is pretty predictable, yet well filmed."
3,I think I'm the only one who liked this movie.,"I was very excited to see how the origins on the Alien franchise began. However, there were many questions raised than answered, but it did keep my interest. The movie is beautiful and I'm glad that it wasn't another generic monster movie."
4,Great science fiction!,"If you didn't know, this is a prequel to the Aliens movies, and serves as insight as to where the Xenomorphs came from. I really enjoyed this one."
2,A Start For Your Alien Collections,A little more introduction of how the 'Aliens' really began. Needed to explain why the 1st kept these 'things' in containers and where did they come from. I enjoyed all the alien movies and this would go with the rest of my collections.
2,Terrible Playback,Unfortunately i can review the playback so the stars will reflect on the movie. THe movie is awesome the HD playback was horrible. The colors were terribly dark. The bluray disk play a beautiful picture on my TV so the issue isnt the end product. Hopefully Amazon Prime fixes this on their Stream Rate side of the house.
2,prometheus,It was just lame!!!It is so bad i don't even remember all the reasons for this stupid film of mind numbing goofy crap.And i am being kind by giving it 2 stars...
2,weak plot after interesting opening,"The preview for Prometheus was promising so I planned to have a night in at the movies, which didn't work out. The plot thinned rapidly and midway through the show it plummeted into a sci-horror film, which was not of interest at all. I ended up catching up on the new catelogues & magazines that had arrived and glanced at the movie in hopes of a change in plot. It was not worth the time or money spent watching it, which was very disappointing."
1,disappointing,I found it very disappointing. The plot in was flawed and foolish. It was hard to follow. Reminded me of Alien.
1,Blu Ray is a SCAM,Just received the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital copy of Prometheus from Amazon. Tried to play it on my Pioneer BDP-320 and cannot get beyond a black screen. Looks like Track 88. Downloaded and installed version 3.73 firmware upgrade (dated March 2012). No luck. Tried to play it on my ASUS EeeTop and of course it says it need an upgrade but when you are directed to Arcsoft it says I am using the latest version (dated 2009). When I upgraded to Total Media Theater 5 lo and behold it worked. But this would cost me $99 for an unlocked version. Right now I am using it for 15 days free trial. So I tried to download a digital copy and iTunes say that my redemption code is not valid. So I guess I can only watch the DVD copy.
1,Waste of $3.99,What a horrible movie! Couldn't connect with any characters. They go looking for a planet because of same cave scribbles. They find it and are attacked by aliens. Lead woman is impregnated by said aliens. Everyone dies but her. END.
1,the rottenest of tomatos,"This movie is el stinko, el rotteno, made me want to pukeo. The worst ever film in years;: should be the subject of a product recall."
1,Way over-rated!!,Thought is was boring and pretentious. Don't get at all why some people love this movie. It tried to be intelligent but was really just overblown
2,Do your research on Ridley Scott before watching,"I'm more angry at myself for not figuring out this movie than I am angry at Scott or the movie. The acting is good but the story is very boring and tries to add suspense but never fulfills. If you are going into this expecting something new and exciting - you will be disappointed as I was. The movie begins almost 100 years in the future and the team of doctors/scientists/engineers and yes, the ubiquitous millionaire investor, are looking for answers to our existence. Searching for God, if you will. If you are not religous, you might find the ""awakening"" for these folks funny. If you are religous, I suggest you be prepared to be insulted and even angry. Not a horrible movie but I would wait for it to come out for $1 - if I had done that, I would not be so emotional about being disappointed by this movie."
1,"Horrible, Simply Horrible.","This is supposed to be a prequel to the excellent ""Alien"" series. It fails in so many ways that I cannot begin to describe it other than just horrible."
1,Viewer beware,"When a movie's praise is in the form of defensive reviews, rather than its own merit, you know the film has problems. A poorly written film from a great director."
3,WHY THE HELL PEOPLE REVIEWS THE MOVIE?????,"This is amazon.com. We enter here to BUY PRODUCTS, and user reviews are supposed to review the product, which, in this case, is the bluray. Talk about the languages, the extras, the quality, but don't talk about THE MOVIE!!! 300 reviews and the bluray is in preorder state. Go to IMDB to review the movie and leave this useful for purchasers!!!"
1,Thud.,"What a stunning, totally unexpected letdown for me after anticipating ""Prometheus"" for months. It was simply godawful: the screenplay, the casting, the acting (except for Michael Fassbender), the editing, the musical score...all a giant mess. Advance word was that ""Prometheus"" was a turkey, but I didn't, could not, believe it. I was wrong."
3,Aliens with a slight twist,"I was hoping for more but all I could think of was Aliens for 90% of the movie. The potential for a really great movie was there but it got lost in the standard ""nasty-alien-in-my-body"" theme. To think the supreme race is reduced to making monsters to do their dirty work is silly. Noomi Rapace is a pleasant surprise although somewhat normalized in this Hollywood role."
4,Prometheus 3D Blu Ray Review,"While the movie was not as good as I had hoped when I viewed at the cineplex, I found the Blu Ray disc to be an excellent reproduction of the theatrical experience. Both visuals and audio were as well presented as the theatrical version and the 3D effects were well done and not excessive."
3,Not enough gets explained,"This movie had real promise as a prequel to the Alien movie series. Unfortunately, the script was subpar, and the acting to go along with it (to be expected from a space sci-fi, I guess). But the worst part about the movie is how much stuff goes unexplained. Why does the robot guy act the way he does? What's the relationship between the multiple alien species? Why would all these people take a 2 1/2 year trip into space without knowing why they were going? Perhaps many of these questions get answered in the follow up movie that seems to be set up at the end. But I think a better job of explaining at least some of it could have been done. I gave it 3 stars simply because it was moderately entertaining, but I'd probably go with 2 1/2 stars if I could."
3,A wasted opportunity,"The characters were quite unengaging, the plot was simplistic. The crew members of Promethius attitude to the potential threats of their enterprise was unbelievably casual. The special effects were good, but the growth and metabolism of the aliens was not at all credible as their food sources were insufficient to provide the energy required, even if they had fantastically efficient metabolisms. The producer tried too hard to incorporate all the elements of aliens depicted in previous films,- less detail and more ambiguity would have been more effective and convincing."
3,Aliens,It explains a lot of where the creepy little aliens came from and left its self wide open for a sequel.
3,Disappointing,"Great special effects were to be expected but the character developement leaves much to be desired. As a Ridley Scott fan, I am extremely disappointed by the number of questions raised and the lack of resolution to ANY of them. Are there 2 factions of architects?What was up with the programing and agenda of the ""Artificial Human""?Architects visiting developing humans and leaving clues for what purpose? How many different types of genetic material are stored, or are they all the same? Why would Architects need a weapon? These are just some of the questions which remain unanswered. Prometheus II? Not really interested! Too many possible back stories and outcomes and all that I can imagine seem unrealistic and inconsequential.The ship Prometheus should have never left earth it was a waste of their time and mine!"
2,Disappointment,Not near as good as some other work that Ridley Scott has done.It seemed to have missed the mark.. whatever that mark was.
4,Prometheus,I personally think this movie was one of the better scifi films ive seen this year. Its definitely a better film than i expected.Could the story line of the film been more defind or developed? Yes. But non the less this was a interesting film.
2,Had Hoped reviews were wrong,"Movie was quite boring in all. Special effects were okay but not outstanding. A big disappointment in story-line and acting. Oh well, can't enjoy everything!"
2,Waste of time and money,"Well, it's typical, curiosity kills everyone. If you get this, you can skip the first hour, nothing happens. Charlize gets stuck with an entirely plastic character, Noomi's heroine is totally predictable. Slimy ugly aliens and a lot of dark graphics so you can't see much of anything."
2,Could have been so much more.,"This movie started out with so much potential, that is completely wasted as the movie goes on. It ends up being a complete waste of time.."
2,prometheus,weird plot and overall i just didn't like it but the details are lost since in been a few weeks now
2,not a great movie,special effects are the best part of this movie! not a good story to tell your friends about and not avery good ending?
2,Very Disapointing,"This movie could have been great. The opening scene made me want to know more about the origins of the alien people. In the end, however, I had more questions than answers. Furthermore, the actors were barely ok and their characters did not like one another with the exception of the anthropologist couple (who, in my opinion, did not fit together). There was a lot of dying going on and to be honest I did not care for any of those who did not make it until the end of the movie, or those who did for that matter. Very disappointing."
3,Good not great,"Story is a bit cliche'. Somewhat predictable. Special effects and sound are excellent so, go for the HD version.Entertaining, but not a 2001:Space Odyssey or Avatar."
4,"Nicely done, little short","Good acting, nice script, excellent CGI. Maybe it seemed short because I was enjoying it so much. Hope for more like this."
2,Nice movie title and movie cover.....,It did not excite or inspire me to be looking for a sequel.....ok one time flick to watch once. Ok
2,Watch Alien instead,"This movie is such a rip off of Alien, dont waste your money on Prometheus. The plot lines are so similar, and even both aliens could be twins, they looked so much alike. I am surprised Ridley Scott, who also directed Alien, would direct this poor imitation."
1,Wouldn't download,"The movie might be great but I wouldn't know. I've been trying to download this to my iPad for days, but it took so long I gave up.I will never use Amazon movie rentals again. Lesson learned."
1,disappointed,In this day and age and with all his cinematic experience he produced a real sleeper It's no wonder this movie is hardly known.
2,A major disappointment,"I've been a major Ridley Scott fan since Alien - I'd watch anything he did. So Prometheus was the most anticipated of all his work and the first that I've considered a major let-down. It's a perfect example of less is more. Alien is on my top ten list of my all-time favorite movies and I could go on endlessly about how great that picture is - I won't. But its worth remembering how effective Alien is without the use of computer graphics, leaving the viewer to fill in what is not actually seen. Prometheus on the other hand is so overburdened with CGI that it becomes somewhat ridiculous and unbelievable. That's just me - I miss the old Ridley."
2,wasted effort for sci-fi audience,"Great special effects wrapped around a plot from the early '50s. We ignored the dumb plot in Alien because it was less sci-fi and more of a slasher movie. Prometheus is not so lucky; the dumb plot sticks out like a sore thumb. 3D effects are great; elevating my rating to a 2. However, Prometheus may be a 4 or 5 for audiences who don't read sci-fi or who don't know what NASA's Curiosity is. There's not much science in this sci-fi movie."
3,"Sadly, I was left a little disappointed.","I was so looking forward to this movie. This is a pretty movie that piggy back's on Alien and X-Files but without the action or tension. In addition, great actors were wasted since they really had relatively little screen time and even those seemed to somehow be after thoughts.And my husband was even more disappointed than I was."
1,Don't do it.,"Wow. Bad. Really bad. This seemed like a last ditch effort to sell something prior to retirement. I enjoyed the Alien series when I was younger, but this. I am so glad I didn't go to the theater for this one. Predictable."
3,"Great premise, strange ending",I thought the premise was good and would make a great movie. The premise was good but the movie took a strange direction. It ended ok but could have been so much better.
3,More Hype,"Just another basic Hollywood movie Hyped up as usual. It was good,but not a..l..l..t..h..a..t. Some good affects,but drawn out too long.Worth the watch,but not purchasing the disc."
3,Ok.....,The story would have been better is they had elaborated more on the aliens and not the humans....I was a little disapointed.
1,Utter garbage,Good effects but that's it. I'm getting a bit tired of effects driven movies.In the end no real conclusion after all the mess that happened in the film. Nough said.
1,Major Disappointment,"I was a huge fan of the Alien movies, and had high expectations for Prometheus. Character development was weak, and the plot jumped around inexplicably. This film had little redeeming value and I regret that i'll never get back the time spent watching this move."
3,It was just a horror movie,"It could have been such a good movie, but the director went the horror route. It had such potential but failed."
3,Predictable,Prometheus - The plot was predictable and a little stupid. The most interesting aspect of the story line was how he tied this movie in the Alien series.
4,good,Not as good as expected but did enjoyed it. Easy to follow but to many different types of aliens critters.
4,Prometheus,The movie started out a little slow. I thought it was an overall good movie. Lots of things to follow. Good Sci-fi flick.
4,Great Movie for Alien Fans,Saw this at the movies and have bought the DVD. As a fan of the first 2 movies I thought this was as good. Movie is well paced like the first and builds to a great climax. Michael Fassbander is excellent. Leaves the door open for sequels as well.Could be considered a prequel to alien but stands well enough on its own. Overall I thought Ridley Scott did a great job with this.
3,Lots of excitment,This movie was not the best I've seen but it was scary and thrilling.I would give this a pretty good rating and I would tell other movie watchers tosee this one.
3,"The prequel to ""Alien""","Special effects take first place in this movie, and they are wonderful. But the characters are really just caricatures. So for a couple of hours of rather mindless entertainment, this movie hits the spot. The 3D, by the way, is very well done."
4,Promethius,Excellent movie.......Sci-fi fans will enjoy this.....the finish of the movie definitely left open the possibililty of a sequel to this prequel of the Alien movies....
3,"Interesting, but not the best character development","Perhaps I had expectations for this movie that were too high for movie making these days. Spending more time on your characters then green screen effects seems to be something that the action/sci-fi production houses don't seem to think is all that important for modern viewers these days. It's not that Prometheus was bad, just that I expected to care a bit more. Oh well."
3,Movie was just ok,This movie was not very entertaining. I would not watch this movie again. The video quality was fine. I do not recommend it.
4,do not watch the trailer,"incredible cinamatography, excellent acting from the main cast, and satisfies your Aliens in the abyss craving. However do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER. It gives away the entire plot and ending."
4,Prometheus the myth gets modern!,"I liked this movie, it has a great cast and is full of action in a spectacular special effect way.I love the opening scene at the waterfall, also love the spaceship. I downloaded to my new Fire HD and enjoyed 2+ hours of suspended dis-belief.I think as this movie is so open ended that a sequel is coming soon."
3,Meh,Not quite what I was expecting but entertaining. Not worth buying but worth watching one time. Just do it asa rental.
1,DIGITAL RIP OFF,"Great movie.Great DIGITAL COPY RIP OFF.Sold as the Blu-ray disc PLUS DIGITAL COPY.IT IS A LIE. You do get a ""LIMITED TIME"" RENTAL, you do not get a digital copy to keep."
1,Putrid,"Bad dialogue. Bad plot line. Absurd ""let's take off our helmets!"" character actions. Horrible acting. Retreaded plot from Alien(s), and The Thing. Terrible music, which had nothing to do with the scene it was supposed to be enhancing; instead sounded like someone had the radio on too loud next door. Adris; what is that accent you are trying to fake? He has an English accent in real life, that apparently he can't cover up so we get some bizarre Houston-Luton speak. If our DNA can be traced back to mollusks (it can), how could this thing have given us DNA?? Did it cut in line between early primates and humans? Then how did the DNA from earlier creatures match perfectly? Why? Even with DNA you don't know what species are going to develop or die out. I loved Alien, liked Blade Runner and Aliens, this plain stinks."
1,Prometheus . So bad it makes you angry.,"BAD. Really, really bad. One of the worst scripts I have ever seen on film.Alien is a masterpiece. Aliens is a great action sequel with its own take on the material. Alien 3 is a dark story, and does try to do something original,(the extended version does improve the story and helps to address some of the flaws). Alien Resurrection was an okay film that at least made sense.Prometheus makes absolutely no sense. The scrip is simply TERRIBLE. The story breaks Alien lore completely. The characters are boring, clueless, morons. Just incredibly bad.This is nothing more than a made for TV ""Alien"" spin-off, cash-cow. It is simply the worst Alien movie ever made, and possible one of THE worst movies of all time. It is a tragedy this movie exists, and is a totally wasted opportunity.Mr Scott, you should be ashamed. Allen Smithee wouldn't put his name on this garbage."
4,Good prequel,"Prometheus is part new and part old.Alien was a new idea. Aliens expanded the idea in a very credible and cool way, adding some nice layers of story. Alien 3, 4, AVP, made the Alien world huge.The Prometheus idea is new, which is what makes it awesome, but it uses old cinematic ideas, which is not what I feel about Alien or Aliens. Granted, its probably more and more difficult to come up with something like an Alien/Aliens/Matrix where the movie just feels plain new and fresh and awesome from most every angle, regardless, I have to rate the movie 4 stars rather than 5. I feel like I've seen some of the movie before, and not just in the Aliens franchise.Stil, Prometheus is a firm step up in quality from Alien 3 and beyond, placing it squarely behind Alien/Aliens, decidedly into the must see category. A sequel is assured.. they have the story to make the sequel as good as Alien/Aliens. Now if they can only get James Cameron to direct..."
2,Hard to please,"They missed a great opportunity here, as usual. They wake up the alien Engineer and he just hits people? Really? Seemed just lazy...Engineer chases the little Dr and the giant belly alien squid just HAPPENS to pop out at the exact right moment to ""save"" her? Really? Again, laziness...NO understanding or awareness of what is in the mind of the alien being, NOTHING. Not even a little bit to make us want to know more...how can we want that when we were given NOTHING...no desire, no glimpse. Great effects and visuals but story and execution? Big failure."
1,Several flaws,"Dear Sir, the Prometeus edition has two bigh flaws:The information indicates Spanish sound but it is Latin Spanish no Castellian Spanish so the sound is a deception in Spain.Also the digital copy doen't work outside USA so one of the version provides in the boxset is useless."
1,Much ado about nothing...,"There is MUCH less to this movie than meets the eye.Wooden dialogue. Wooden acting. Uninteresting characters. A well-worn plot, with zero surprises. A perfunctory 'ending.'As is often the case with a Ridley Scott movie, it is a triumph of style over content -- except that the style is now as shop-worn and predictable as the plot.Judging by this effort -- where any viewer with a mental age approaching double digits is far ahead of every predictable turn of the plot -- Ridley Scott is now running on empty."
1,Juvenile Delinquents in Space.,Some reviews said this movie makes you THINK? REALLY! Because its my opinion the crew of the Prometheus would of died from their own stupidity even if they had not encountered the alien. The alien seemed to be the only one in the movie that knew what it was doing.
1,Please Quit Insulting My Intelligence,"This was so bad....no character development, stupid reasoning - an example is that once they have traveled x amount of mile and x amount of years to arrive at an unknown planet and the security team is gearing up to escort the scientist on an exploratory mission. One of the main characters, a scientist, tell the security guy (I don't remember the exact words) that this is a scientist mission that they didn't need weapons. Right! How stupid! It continues from there. No intelligence from this movie."
2,And then what happened?,"If the standard explanation for how life began on earth bores you, there's always this version where it all started with a naked, puking albino. Sorry, ""Prometheus"" didn't do it for me. Yeah, I know we might be a little sick of our old drooling friend with the acid blood, but at least he didn't talk, which is more than I can say for everyone in this movie. In fact, they yak all the way through it. The visuals seem like a fusion of ""Metropolis"" and ""Stargate,"" but there's none of that shadowy, dark, damp atmosphere that added to the impact of the ""Alien"" series. Noomi Rapace is no Sigourney Weaver, and Charlize Theron is totally wasted as a space vamp. The best character is David, the android and one wonders why androids couldn't have been in charge of the whole thing from the beginning. At least they don't talk much."
1,Waste of time!,One of the worst movies I've had the misforune to watch! I don't know why I watched it to the end. Maybe I was hoping for something interresting to happen.
1,Boring!,My husband and I sat through about 40 minutes of this movie....how we endured that long I cannot say. My son was the only one to finish the movie.
1,good story-line,"Searching for the origin of Mankind is a compelling story-line, and people will watch it just for that, but this movie fails on every other level. It borrows, poorly, from many sci-fi movies and offers nothing original. The complicated, exotic looking two-hand flame guns are less impressive than a can of hair-spray and a Bic lighter, and the movie is filled with lame effects such as that. Maybe the cliches will make it a cult film just for the silliness. If it were a book, no one would read it, there is no plot or imagination, and I wouldn't even call it sci-fi, it's just ridiculous low-budget fantasy."
2,Not worth watching,"The movie was kind of ""eh"" for me. The plot seemed jumbled and the characters are so dumb you want them to be killed. Not much else to say."
1,No answers. No Alien,This movie was horrible. It did not answer any question and if it did it was late in the movie. Unbelievable that the Alien creature did not show up until the end and even then it did nothing. I hope that there is no second movie to this mess of a movie.
1,one of the worst movies I have seen,a bunch of monkeys could have come up with a better story. Even Theron does not help. Ridley Scott should have shown some respect to his own masterpiece (alien series) and never made this horrible movie or at least have not attempted to associate it with the alien series.
2,Don't ruin the trailer by watching the movie,"Let me sum this ridiculous movie up for you and thereby save you time and money.**** (SPOILERS) ****Some people go to space to find the ""Engineers"" that created us.They find some goo. One guy unintentionally eats the goo.He has sex with a women. Within one day of sex, she has a squid for a baby; the baby was removed by C-section.The squid-baby grows really large and kills an Engineer (who was trying to kill the squid-baby's mother).An alien jumps out of the Engineers stomach.The end.The effects were cheesy (you will laugh at the ""scary"" scenes) and the story was poorly written.I was looking forward to the exploration of (what I thought was) the central topic: mankind's creation. But there was none of that. At the end there were no answers to the big questions of life, just a set-up for a sequel."
3,Leaves more questions than answers,"If you are looking for the complete back story to Aliens, this might not be it. I thought there were too many inconsistencies in the story that didn't account for the observations and artifacts in Aliens. The result is way short of any kind of interesting treaties on immortality and the origin of species and just becomes a rather predictable bang-bang shoot 'em up. Probably won't see it again and certainly won't buy it."
4,Alien Prequel?,"When I first saw the preview, I was intrigued. DNA manipulation and ever present thirst for why we are here, drives the movie's undertone. But then things go terribly wrong. Not to reveal to much, but the writers did a great job of connecting to the franchise."
4,Good not great,"I purchased this simply because I own all of the Alien films and I must say it wasn't quite what I expected. Originally it was intended to be a prequel to Alien, but Ridley Scott decided to make it a stand alone film. It didn't stand very well. It was interesting but not enough to rate it on par with Alien and Aliens. Good try but probably should've stayed with the original plan. It would have been more interesting as a prequel."
2,boring,"Had I not seen the Alien series first I might have liked this a bit better. The God dude breaking off into little pieces spreading out into the earth seemed to much like Scientology to me. I guess after a while you get jaded, good special effects but I've seen better. It was OK just glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it."
2,Bad movie,I thought this was going to be awesome. Instead it was awful. What a waste of my time and money.
2,Not really good,"There is really no reason to watch this movie.Seemed too long and just boring.The story was decent, but really no reason to ever watch"
3,I think I'm being generous with three stars.,"Biggest let down of the summer. Fitting that it was written by a LOST scribe. It had about the same feeling of disappointment at the end. It is pretty to look at and there is some fine acting, but it left some gaping plot holes. Actors acted out of character. They were not the brightest bunch to select for a trillion dollar expedition to find our origins and immortal life. Scott really missed the boat (or spaceship) on the film. I'd rank it above Alien 3 and 4, but that isn't high praise. I think he needs to step away from the Blade Runner project after seeing this film. I know he wants to do a sequel to this prequel, but I'm not excited by the idea."
2,If u like far fetched sci fi,A little choppy with the story. Could of been a good movie. It didn't have much of a beginning. I guess. It's alien.
2,waste of time..,"About 45 minutes into this film, I wanted my rental fee back. Really bad cross between Alien and 2001 a Space Odysey... I expected more from Riddley Scott. The acting was absurd as well."
3,"Great effects, lousy plot.","Great special effects, 3 D was okay, stupid decisions by crew, okay story, lotsa holes, answers no questions. Looking for sequel."
2,Not a Fan,I was excited to see this. It was visually appealing and the story was compelling but it left me wanting much more. Won't buy.
3,My boyfriend wanted to see this,It was a lot better than what I expected but not really my type if movie. The ending makes me think there's gonna be another one
3,Prometheus,"This movie was a bit long, and didn't really have a great plot. At the end, everyone who watched it with me was still wondering what the point was."
2,Did you see 2001?,"This is mostly a 2001 ripoff, right down to the wrinkly old man. As others have pointed out the movie is filled with improbabilities, but the special effects are good."
1,Stupidist pretentious movie - and director,This movie was the most pretentious and stupid movie I have seen in a long timeRidley Scott (and his screenplay writers) should be banned from ever making movies again - an ego driven piece of junkHe (and they) should retire
1,I was warned ...,"My friends told me this is an awful movie & yet I still rented it ... how bad could it be, really?? REALLY BAD! There are huge plot holes you could walk through. This is supposed to be the prequel to first Alien movie and it does a terrible job of explaining anything. There are scenes that serve no purpose other than someone deciding there needed to be an action scene ... HERE!If you don't listen to your friends like I should have, then listen to the reviews ... don't rent this movie ... it's 2 hours of your life you will never get back!"
1,"Deja vu, cheesy and embarrassing for R. Scott","cheesy. can't believe Ridley Scott directed this piece of garbage.The movie is a collection of previous ideas and other movies. It fails at almost every level.It brings absolutely nothing new, characters are awful, actors acting horrible, screenplay terrible, all in all bad bad bad.Don't waste your money on this one. A complete disappointing experience."
1,Waste of time and money,This is nothing but a cheesy prequel will to Alien. A total waste of time and money. Save your money and go watch Alien again
2,"Ummm, script?","Look, it's 2012. It's time that we stop running around chasing special effects in place of smart, well written stories. The plot in this film is frankly hilarious and improbable at best, cynical and stupid at worst. Without a good story, there is no dramatic tension. Without dramatic tension, there is no film. Period. I want my 2 hours back Ridley, I really do.I will refrain from citing specific examples save for this one. After our male lead visits the area of interest, all he does for the balance of the film's running time is toddle around drunkenly on the ship. He is effectively removed from the plot. Why was he introduced as a lead in the first place?Two 10 year old boys could come up with a better script over the lunchroom table. Pow Pow!"
2,Boring and Very Predictable,"The concept behind this movie was great. But the execution was poor. The movie was extremely boring, which made it seem to drag on forever. Also, there was no original content."
2,Remake Alien,Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids. Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids. Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids. Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids.
2,Not in the same galaxy as Alien...not even good.,"I can't tell if this movie was poorly written or hacked to death during a Hollywood schedule crunch, but the end result is that the story line is botched and the characters completely unbelievable. There were so many times during the movie when I found myself shaking my head because of some ridiculous premise or character reaction. It's a shame, because I found a few of the ideas and graphics to be bordering on stunning. I hate long-winded reviews and the trite vocabulary lessons that accompany them, so I'll just close by saying that I was very disappointed with this film."
3,"Neat effects, disappointing story","I was hoping for some classic sci fi, but this isn't it. The visual style is intersting and the effects are good, but honestly I could watch the beginning of alien over and over, and this movie is only worth one watch. The origin story is pretty cheesy as well. The only thing I will remember is the ""eyeball"" scene."
3,little dissapointing,not as exciting as the preview seemed to low budget but thats my opinion rent it first to see if you like it or not
2,Huh?,"While the plot idea is interesting, the execution wasn't. The characters lack depth so it's hard to care about them one way or another. And the movie isn't self-contained. It's a set up for a sequel.The only thing of real interest in the movie is the way it ties into other Ridley Scott movies. I won't spoil it but be on the lookout for the teasers."
2,Overrated,"While it explains some of the aliens origins, it builds up way too much suspense and spends much too little time on actual climax and post-climax details."
1,A travesty,"I struggle to find one good thing to say about this movie. The special effects were alright, but ultimately hey were deployed with little impact. Ridley, how did you manage to trip and fall during your victory lap?"
1,This was sooooooooooo bad.,"I am a female but I do love Charlize ALMOST, no matter what, but this was a bit tooooooooo boring and so very poorly done."
3,Looks good. Works minute by minute. Doesn't add up to anything.,"It kept my attention, but when it was over, I didn't care. Two days later, I could barely tell you what it's about."
2,"Poor 3D, poor film","Apart from the opening sequence, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a 3D blu ray, even if you like the film.As for the movie itself - I went into it without the expectations of it being an Alien prequel, but as a scifi movie made by probably one of the best directors of the genre out there. The plot, suspense and acting are all awful. About the only good thing about this is the special effects, but even they won't wow you.For the amount this cost to make, you'd expect far better.This will sit and collect dust.For anyone looking for a good scifi, I recommend Moon. Cost nothing to make, keeps you gripped for 2 hours and is about $12 for the blu. I wasn't aware of it until I saw it on Crackle, but its very good."
4,Good prologue not only gives an answer but also offers inspired inclues to futures plots.,"This is a good prologue movie. It invokes my curiosity of Alien 1. I am glad to wait for prologue 2 after this, since I am curios about what happens when they got to another Engineers' spaceship. And what happens on the first alien."
1,EPIC What in the HELL,"I could have lived the rest of my days happy and not watching this movie. Love the cast......and that was it. Wasn't really worth making, IMHO. If it a free view and you have NOTHING happing in you life..... go ahead and watch it. (or clip your toenails instead) lol"
4,"Flawed, but awesome!","PROMETHEUS showcases one of the most intriguing android performances, ever. The amazing landscape and spaceship sets, impeccable design and sleek photography put you there! However, the script is a bit uneven and illogical at times. I can't help but think how great the conflict would have been, if the crew found the Engineer 40 minutes sooner and had to deal with the big lug, instead of having many members of the crew killed by their own stupidity. When the Engineer awakes to the sight of the ""out of place humans"" in the nest of his bio-warfare/development facility, it should be pretty clear why he reacts the way he does.Your first screening may leave you with questions and ""what the hell?"" moments. The best viewing is the 2nd viewing, in my opinion."
4,A terrific science fiction film from a true believer,British filmaker Ridley Scott goes back to the origins of the Alien saga to presents us what he really mastered. period.
3,Not so great,"I was expecting more from this movie. I think they used special effects in place of a good story and hopped you would be happy with that. The other problem I had with this was the digital copy showed in iTunes and all I needed was the code to download it, but the code they included doesn't work. So no digital copy after all."
3,Alien rebooted.,This could have been a great movie if they would have left it out of the Alien universe and let it stand on its on.
3,Waiting for the directors cut...,"It looked and sort-of felt cool, but as is didn't' make much sense. The director's cut supposedly has over 40 minutes of material that didn't make it into the theatrical and initial DVD release we see here. Perhaps when that extra 40 minutes is revealed, this movie will actually make sense."
3,Should have been a director's cut,"Being a die-hard ""Alien"" fan, I was thrilled to see this story take part in the same universe. Sadly, the movie is not quite as exciting as I was hoping for. That's not to say it's a bad movie, but some of the scenes feel forced and obligatory, and with Prometheus 2 on the way time will tell if this movie is merely a setup for future films.As for the disc itself, there are a lot of extended and/or cut scenes in the extras section that they really should have been redited into the film as a director's cut. There is a lot of backstory in these scenes and they would have made the story richer, for sure.Regardless, the picture and sound quality are great and Michael Fassbender is a complete scene-stealer as the android David. This film also has some of the most beautiful scenery (watch the first 5 mins) and fantastic special effects I have ever scene in a film. Definitely worth a watch, only die hard ""Alien"" or Ridley Scott fans should probably buy it."
3,Interesting,"This was an interesting movie, we liked it but not quite as much as expected. Ths special effects were good."
3,"Great acting, beautifully filmed, slow plot","I really like the acting and feel that the movie is beautifully made. Commenting from the perspective of visual effects, I especially like the scenes in which it appears that worlds are being created in a beautiful, elegant web. I found the plot to be too uneventful and even predictable at times, however, and I would give the movie only 2 stars because of the plot were it not for the acting, which I felt was very, very good."
4,3D not that great but better value than blu-ray only,"The 3D rendering of this movie is not that great. I have several top 3D blu-rays as reviewed by Keith Niemeyer which are much better. Even though Prometheus was shot with a 3D camera, the depth of field just isn't very apparent in most live-action shots. The occasional object thrown into the foreground seems forced and is often more distracting than integral into the overall scene. Disappointingly devoid of significant 3D effect are the opening scenes of the planet's landscape and the landing approach of Prometheus. The 3D effects are most evident in scenes with CGI such as the mapping of the tunnels as shown on the bridge of the Prometheus and text overlays. Still, for $5 more than the basic blu-ray version of this movie, I would say this 4-disk version is preferred: both for the 3D disk and for the special features disk."
2,Prometheus,"Slow developing of characters and the relationships to each other and the project. Predictable story line, actually boring in some spots. Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater."
3,for the hearing inpared,"im an avid movie watcher with about 10k movies. this movie was way over rated. the only reason i gave it 3 stars is because it has potential to being a great movie. this movie on the other hand is flawed in its script just one small example (noomi (female) goes to charlize (female) expensive med pod in her private quarters, to use the pod to remove her baby...pod tells her that it cant it was calibrated for men not women)..stupid stuff like that are through out the movieif u want a movie that flows and u dont care to much about (why theres a huge dome over a spaceship) then ull get a 3 star movie.charlize theron wanted to died in this movie on purpose....lol. im only saying that to help out her career cause shes hot and a great actress."
3,Been done,"This is one of those movies that is incredibly derivative. If you've seen more than 3 science fiction movies in the last 20 years, you will recognize them in this film. But it was kind of fun going, ""Oh, that's just like in Alien,"" or ""that's just like Armageddon"", etc. See how many you can name."
3,"""Prometheus"" was a disappointment","I am a big fan of ""Alien,"" and was expecting a similar type of movie, which is a horror movie in Space. Unfortunately, ""Prometheus"" is another Sci-Fi movie with lots of special effects, love interest, and shallow plot; not scary at all. Shame on you, Ridley Scott."
2,boring movie..,"The movie itself was boring, I would say, in a hurry!.. The story is vague, nice scenery (off course, it's HR Giger designs!!), the I did not like the movie. Again, the picture quality/streaming wasn't as I expected, you know, HD crystal.., but it's probably the signal of my network/cable connections..(?)"
2,Riddled with flaws,"This over hyped rehash of 'Alien' is so lethargic and predictable it is really an embarrasment to Ridley Scott's legacy. Was he really so desperate for money that he needed to do this? The unscrupulous corporation, the marines, the strong 'survive-at-any-price' heroine who gets impregnated with an alien, the robot who loses his head, etc... its all fished out and repackaged with a few 3-D special effects. There are some interesting touches, like a throwaway tribute to Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, but on the whole it's a waste of your time and money."
2,letdown,"With all the pre release pub, it didn't live up to its predecessors. Slow moving at first. Effects were pedestrian. Plotlines muddled. It began as Star Trek, ended as Halloween. Even the 3D was nothing special."
5,good movie,This movie was fun to watch. there was a lot of suspense in the movie and a few plot twists. i recommend watching it
2,Not an Alien prequel,The movie may have been able to stand on its own if it hadn’t tried to cash in on Alien. Like most movies none can match the first and this one created a hype that was non existent. If you want this movie expecting to see how Ripley’s nightmare started you’ll be seriously disappointed. If you never seen or cared for the Alien movies but like SciFi and Darwinian theory you may enjoy it. Personally I’d like my money back.
2,"Yes, but why?",Beautiful to look at and Michael Fassbender is an acting class unto himself. But - without getting into any spoilers - why does this movie exist? It seems designed to be the set up for the Alien series (disregarding the terrible AVP films) but in the end it violates its own directive by not completing the task and by asking more questions that it deliberately sets out not to answer. I don't know if it happened in the editing room or not - but it completely negated the purpose of making this movie at all.
2,I really really really wanted to love this movie...,"****NO SPOILERS****Seriously. I was excited to see this movie.But in no way did it live up to the hype. Disappointing would an understated. Yes, visually it was great. But, do you go to a movie just for the CGI?It was plodding and disjointed due its massive moral prerogative.Poor choices in stars who delivered lackluster performances.The major paradox in this movie is how can it be so dull and slow and yet feel as if they are trying to rush the story line.Poor job by Mr Scott in the directors chair."
3,Space,"While this movie does answer several questions that come from the original Alien movies it raises more questions than it answers. It also builds too slowly and it is a little longer than necessary. If you liked the Alien movies it is worth the watch, but it fails to deliver all the goods."
2,disapointed,"The seller corrected my disappointment by taking back and returning money I payed for product, I was really unable to enjoy the movie at all because it had many audio problems and bad pixels throughout the video, but from what I did see it was too much like Alien! Alas people don't be afraid to purchase something from the seller, because they did take care of the problem!Sincerely, bart black"
2,"Proof that with enough special effects, a below average movie succeeds","I know some folks who were dazzled by the special effects completely missed how bad the story was, that they will vehemently disagree with me but this is my opinion, you can have yours.I gave this movie 2 stars only because of the tie in with the alien movie.Yes some swear it is not a prequel but it is from the first gen face hugger,the first gen alien,to the spacecraft itself. (watch the original alien and judge for yourself.arthur's review is one of the best (take the quiz for yourself), and read his one star review and you'll see why I agreed with him,and many others.( go,go, goto the one stars and read and take the quiz it's great fun!)No scientists would act the way those idiots did.I hope the sequel is better (if there is one.)"
2,don't like,"It's not an entirely worthless movie. I mean, the CGI is stunning, and a few years from now when it is being shown on UPN some Sunday afternoon I'd watch it instead of tennis.Seriously though, the plot doesn't make sense and the characters suck. The only reason to watch it is because it looks pretty."
3,Samo samo space cliché,"This presentation is nice enough to follow the standard formula. However people that like this formula won't be disappointed. Nerds in space with robots that look like people and aliens that look like...um...aliens.Charlize Theron looks cute in her skin tight black suit. But the real focus is on Michael Fassbender as David the unknown quantity.Just do not expect this movie to tie up everything in a pink ribbon as it looks like it was designed to be the beginning of a series or maybe the prequel to that their ""Alien"" series."
4,Prometheus [HD],Good movie. I was genuinely entertained throughout. I didn't really expect to see the aliens show up in the end. That kindve threw a little twist in things.
3,Reasonably done Sci-Fi movie,"Wasn't what I expected, but was an interesting story line. Guess I didn't expect it to be a prequal to Alien."
3,It's okay,Just cant get into the story. Is it Scifi or Horror? Felt long with not much action. Don't explain anything and the connection with Aliens.
3,A little drawn out...,They could have cut an hour out of this movie and I don't know why they bothered making this a prequel to Alien. Great effects but just didn't tie in with Aliens.
3,Good action movie with some thought provoking moments.,"I enjoyed the initial story line and how it developed. The hidden story kept me intrigued. The ending was less than inspiring. A big build up for bit of a let down. The final destination was a open end to the movie. The alien sequence at the end wasn't needed and confused other parts of the movie. I enjoyed the ""who created us, where did we come from, what's the purpose of life. The wanting to live forever thought, was also a attention grabber. The intellectual aspects of storyline kept me engaged. The look of the movie and special affects were great too. Overall in enjoyed the experience."
4,Great Scott Ridley Stuff,"It leaves a great 'grab' for a sequel. Watched it twice during the rental period. Once on my Kindle and once on my computer. Could not get it to work on my I-Pad. I do recommend it, especially for those who have followed all the other Alien movies."
2,Good for DVD/Online,not a big suprise and nothing that would keep it in your memory beyond a week. Good for a one time watch
3,Definately a rental,Not scary at all. Aliens was way better and scarier. Home c-section was comical and story could have been better
2,"Nice visuals, the rest of the film was a failure","I watched Prometheus on DVD in regular old 2D (don't care for 3D, never really works for me).The visuals were nice but much of the film is in the dark and it was hard to impossible to see whatwas going on. However, bigger distractions were the fragmented, hokey story and the stupid, stupidcharacters. The story was not very coherent and made little sense. THe characters behaved stupidly (withintthe context of the story) and did not behave like real people would in the situations in the story. I canbarely recommend this DVD for viewing. I certainly wouldn't buy it."
3,Could Have Been Great,"A near miss, sad but this could have been a great sic fi flick. Still, you should see it, it didn't suck but the narrative was whisper thin and barely worth the effort."
3,"Good, but not phenomenal","A friend of mine said this was the ""best movie"" he had ever seen, so I had pretty high expectations. I agree that the special effects were phenomenal. But I thought the plot was just okay. It seemed ""familiar""."
2,Don't waste your time buying this...wait for NetFlix,"Not worth your time. It even gets boring towards the end. The cinematography is dark, and this movie just really makes you want to take a nap."
4,good,i thought this was a good movie. I stayed interested the whole movie. and i'm a tuff critic. i would watch it again.
2,Dissappointing movie,"This movie had great hype and I really looked forward to it as the ""beginning"" of the Alien series, but it was a major dissappointment. Sort of a combination of ""Contact"" with ""Event Horizon"", but without the development of the characters."
2,"Not very Ingenious,",Perhaps If I would've brainstormed enough I would've made a better screenplay.Seriously? Crappy foreshadowing on why they went to the experiment planet. No real reason to watch this movie. Waste of $4. is good when there is nothing else to view and it's free.
2,"Great graphic, just confusing",REally looked forward to this movie and wanted to understand tie to Alien's movies. Unfortunately it offered more questions than answers. At least answer something!
3,Nice prequel to the series,"For what it's worth it completes the saga of Aliens by telling us where they came from in a manner of speaking. If you like the Alien saga, this may be just the movie for you."
3,Take it or leave it,The movie was decent but the way it was pitched as not being a prelude to the Alien series and then finding that it was . . . . it was a bit disappointing.
1,1 star for the product (not a movie review),"I'm pretty irritated that in order to get all the supplemental materials available I was forced to pay the extra money for this 3D collector's edition. I do not own, nor do I plan to purchase a 3D capable player or television. I was forced to buy something I would not be able to use so that I could get bonus materials that should have been included in the non-3D blu-ray release. I guess this is the business model of the future, being - not quite FORCED but definitely ENCOURAGED to upgrade to the latest and greatest. I really feel bad for anyone who hasn't made the upgrade to blu-ray yet, boy, did you poor DVD only folks get screwed on this release - big time. Shame on you 20th century fox, shame. I don't know if anyone out there would be interested in purchasing the 3D movie-only disk portion of this set by itself, but as soon as I am able to list it for sale I'm going to see if I get any bites."
2,Really...!!,"You have got to be kidding me. Yes, I understand the complexities of CGI and so forth but Jesus Christ.......this movie fails on so many levels. This is absolutely NOT what I expected. It is an abortion of all the Alien series. Sorry your brother was going through difficult times Ridley, but Jesus, maybe it would have been better to step back for a bit. This movie was complete tripe. The dialouge, the casting, the etc. was malignant. The only thing I enjoyed was David and his ""knowledge"". I just wish Bishop was there to guide him through this massive hemorrhage. I wouldn't be this harsh on a newcomer, but holy fin christ, you really had to pay the rent didn't you. It was a discombobulated farce of a cinema related excursion.....I half wanted David to morph into Bishop. No...I WHOLLY wanted David to morph into Bishop. Let's see....14.99 could have translated into a cheap steak dinner or food for a month. Thanks for helping me decide."
1,"Don't waste your money or more importantly, your time!!!!","The film is really rubbish, it had some great potential based on the previous Alien films, this ""prequel"" has let the rest down badly. Maybe there will be more to come and this is just the Jar Jar Binks of the prequels??In any case not worth paying for at any rate, if one of your friends has actually paid for the dvd/bluray then borrow it from them and when you are really bored and have no other options to spend your time doing something more interesting then watch it."
1,Alien rip off,"If you've seen Aliens, you've seen this. Except this one doesn't even deserve one star. Don't waste your money, wait until it's free"
1,Watch Aliens,"My fist ever Review.The movie is a take off of Aliens, way back 70 something. Simple drivel. Anyone who likes mission, military forces, how ANYONE would run an op, especially expensive equipment. And you have a rogue walking cyber computer on your Team? He would have been waxed first. Go see the old Aliens movies, I bought, watched 2/3 through, simply a waste for those in the know."
2,Just Breaking: Alien Dierector sues Prometheus.,"Wow, they didn't even try to hide the fact that they used a photocopy machine to steal the Plot from Alien. This Lame excuse for taking your money follows the plot for Alien almost at about 75%. Fancy spaceship and a crew...check. Android that gets his head ripped off...check. Alien parasite that implants itself in the female Heroine...check. Alien sends tube down throat of victims...check. Female heroine only survivor..check."
1,I was brainf@$ed !,"If you need a good laxative and/or a good ipecac, this movie is just what the doctor's ordered. Enjoy and dont forget the bucket that you will be s@$iting in and p$%ng in the whole time."
2,I paid for this?,"I can't believe I bought this movie. I wish that I had rented it, then it may not have been so bad. The whole plot was a joke. The acting sucked. The aliens sucked. The characters reasoning abilities sucked. I was pulled off the couch by all the suction. Nobody noticed when the woman came in all bloody and half naked? No, ""what the hell happened to you?"" Any high school student could have written this movie and it would have had better dialog.Sucked. Don't waste money buying this, rent it. You will not want to see it a second time."
3,Disappointing.,"I saw this opening weekend as I am a huge fan of the first two films. Even number 4 is watchable as a B flick (especially the Dir Cut). But this new film has the IQ of a rodent - no that's wrong - rodents can find their way out of a maze, can't they? In this film all sense of character and storytelling is lost. As others have said it reeks of test audience re-writes. Thus a film by committee. Disgusting. The picture is beautiful - what do you expect from the best SFX houses and $130 M? The film as a whole is an abject failure of junk science and silly plot lines. More suitable for a teens in the woods Z grade horror flick. I am giving it a charitable 3, but it really deserves a negative, imaginary number. Shame Ridley, shame."
3,"Perturbed, Humored And New Realizations. All in 3-D","Call me old-fashioned but...Personally I would be quite perturbed if i could not conceive a human baby but a baby alien has no problem at all developing in my womb. Probably perturbed to the point of not being up for much acrobatic activity right after having a baby alien c-section. But, I'm a guy so what do i know.Kudos on making sure that android has head ripped off. Any proper sci-fi film is only worth its' salt if an android has head ripped off. Bigger kudos if the android can still talk after decapitation. Although, I was hoping the android would sing 'Daisy' whilst doing an android jig - so slight disappointment there.Very positive note: I did discover a great attraction for Meredith ""lick her"" Vickers. She's certainly the best excuse for spending a little extra and seeing movie in 3-D. She is going to be one of those starlets who looks even better ten years from now. Lovely. 3 stars"
1,Laughably Bad,"My wife and I previewed the Blu-Ray version, thinking we might spring for the 3D. The visuals of the first third of the movie might have looked cool in 3D, but the rest was so incredibly, laughably bad it could not have been worse even in old, grainy 8mm projected onto a sheet hung on the basement wall.Who in the world finds this sort of dreck worth viewing - except for a hearty laugh? Plot - lame. Dialogue - lame. Acting - lame. Casting - OMG! Costumes - lame. Religious/philosophical/moral exploration - absurdly, laughably lame! Special effects - trite. Photography - fair, but wasted. Music - unmemorable. Nothing to recommend it. Zero. Zip. Nada."
3,Decent Rental,"This movie had it's moments, but overall I was bored. It had a few good moments and is definitely worth one watch if you are into the Aliens franchise."
5,great movie,Great 3d affects answered a lot of questions. Added a couple new questions will we have to wait another 30 years for those.
4,Aliens Prequel SPOILER ALERT,Very Vague Aliens Prequel . Otherwise decent SciFi Movie .Decent Effects . Story Was A Little Too Vague about The Engineers and Their Master Plan
5,excellent,nothing short of great. movie was everything you would expect from ridley scott. I loved how it referenced the alien movies so closely
4,Great Images,"Short summary: stunning visuals, weak story, weaker science. Still, as this movie was shot in 3D, I am happy to own the Blu-Ray if only as a beautiful demo of 3D. The Amazon instant video gives up much of the visual impact beyond the loss of 3D. The picture quality of the streaming version is not even close to the Blu-Ray. This is a blow to the one true strength of this movie."
1,Where have all the good writers gone?,"Predictable, boring, stupid, crap.The writers fill holes with nonsense, don't complete paths in the plot, solutions are contrite and so UN-scientific.for example... picture yourself in the path of a giant bagel rolling toward you. Do you run along the path it's traveling? NO! you run away!! (ok, maybe a small spoiler). Even the alien history/biology/replication concept put forth in the aliens series is thrown to the wind. Only the special effects kept me from turning this off and they were not anything new.Sorry, cannot recommend this at all."
1,Prometheus BluRay playback problems,"I purchased this disc set twice. The first purchase, the 2D film disc played back with much large macro blocking of magenta and green obscuring the image. At first I thought I must need a new version of FirmWare to bring my BluRay player up to date. So I contacted Panasonic and they sent me a revised F/W disc. Once I installed the new CD-R with new F/W, the problem was the same, so I returned the set to Amazon and ordered a second copy assuming I got a bad disc. The second one arrived and I had the same problem. Doing some online searching I found I was not alone. Depending on which BluRay player you own, this particular disc may not play. It looks like certain Panasonic and Sony players will not play this disc without macroblocking, other makes and models do. Sure wish there was more uniformity on BluRay characteristics so these issues would not happen from time to time on new discs."
1,Worst movie in the series,"I was shocked at how terrible this movie was. It started out good and quickly fell off the cliff. I will say there was some promise there, and it was ruined. I love movies and sci-fi stuff but did not enjoy Promethedud. It ruined the entire Alien and Predator series and timelines. BLAH!!"
2,A huge disapointment...,"I give it two stars because the film looks great. The actions of many of the characters are absolutely stupid and when it treaded into Friday the 13th areas; the guy in the ruptured space-suit, toasted and walking around outside the ship and then fighting the others, I checked out. Also, when the ""scientist"" wanted to play with and pet the snake - worm creature, come on, give me an f'ing break. I didn't need a sequel to like this film; I needed a smart film, with characters NOT doing stupid things."
3,A victim of high expectations...,"I was a bit disappointed that the DVD extras didn't include the cool videos used to promote the film. The extended/deleted scenes were nice, but I really expected things like the ""David"" video to be included.The film itself was a bit of a disappointment - I'd already heard mixed reactions to the theatrical release, so the even higher expectations I had prior to the release were already tempered."
1,Prometheus,"I was very disappointed with what I thought was going to be a thoughtful movie about the beginnings of humanity. What it is, is gratuitous violence and a very weak story line."
3,It's okay,"As a major fan of the Alien movies, I found this movie a little slow & was disappointed that it wasn't a clear prequel to the series."
2,Nope,This was boring and I was glad when it was finished. I think there was an opportunity to make this a really good movie but it seems like they didn't know what to do with this story. The ending was done so that a Prometheus 2 could be made but there is no anticipation for it because you are already glad that it's over.
2,Yawning at this demonic pile of ...,I expected something a lil more intelligent and less demonic... it's getting more difficult to findan intelligent sci-fi genre anymore.. so maxed out in demonic plots. Yawwwwnerrrrs. Boooooooooooooooooooo
2,Not a classic,"Very visually interesting, but plot story week. Characters cliche and undeveloped. I was more happy the movie was over than upset with lack of answers. Ending; sequel setup and tie end with Alien."
2,Not much story,Not very enjoyable. Theron got to do very little acting. Old plot not very well told. Maybe you will like it better.
2,Disappointing,"This movie was truly awful. It's only saved from being the worst Aliens movie ever by Aliens Resurrection which is 90 minutes of your life you can never get back. But jesus, this is really the best Scott can do? I felt embarrassed for him. The plot was ludicrously bad and the fact that it was beautifully rendered only makes me sad that so much money and beautiful effects were wasted on such a tired recycle of sci-fi cliches. There's really nothing new here and even the recycling is poorly done given that it is meant seriously not as humor or irony. Prometheus is pretty much exactly what the original Alien movie would have been if it had totally sucked rather then being awesome. If you're really dying for good sci-fi watch Alien again or go read a book. Prometheus really isn't worth your time or money."
1,Months later it still hurts to watch,"I feel like the mythical god Prometheus having my liver ripped from my body, blood spilling out onto the ground beneith me. Over and over I endure he pain and ask for it to stop, but it does not. This is how I feel every time I think of this movie. I felt as if I was watching a VERY beautiful national geographic documentary on human evolution, DNA, etc and in the end a shinny tooth dino-pet erupts from the belly of the beast. I was neither scared or intrigued during this movie. The tone of this movie is dark and also visually ""dark"", but it is not scary and it is not action paced. Imagine being in a classroom with the dull drone of the teacher as he relates and described ""xeno-biology"" every once in a while he throws a couple of rubber snakes at you just to see if you are still paying attention. I have not added my upset with regard to relation to the ""alien"" universe as even without this, the movie by itself lacks everything a good movie should have in it."
2,What were they thinking!!!,"This movie made no sense, the plot if you could find it should have been hidden even deeper. I know it was just a movie but who get up and runs around after major surgery, REALLY!!!!!"
1,Truly awful,"An endless series of missed opportunities, inane plotting, poor acting, feckless directing, and banal writing, punctuated by some very good special effects. And now Scott intends to direct a second Blade Runner movie too, apparently in an ongoing effort to ruin his reputation as one of the most important science fiction directors of all time. God help us."
1,Nothing made sense,"You know how it feels when your watching something and nothing makes sense? If you have NOTHING else to do, watch it just for the effects. No story to make it worth your time"
1,Not very good,"I must say that Arthur J. Bullock, Jr. has written the perfect review of this movie and the funniest review I have ever read. So, buyer beware and be sure to read Mr. Bullock's review before you spend your money."
1,"Awful, breathtakingly bad movie","My wife was the smart one and slept through most of it.There are so many memorably dumb things in this movie. The characters spend at least 45 minutes of the running time walking through the same 3 tunnels looking at stuff. A lady scientist cuts her belly all the way across, including her uterus, pulls out a huge alien, then gets stapled together and walks around like she hasn't just had major surgery. Another scientist plays with a threatening snake alien like it's a squirrel, then is completely shocked when it eats his face off. And, to top it all off, there's a young actor inexplicably made up in the worst old man makeup I've seen since Ed Wood was alive. Instead of using an actual older actor, the director made up his nephew or something to play the part.It's not the dollar and a half I wasted renting it that drove me to Amazon to post a review, it was the 2 hours of my life I will never get to live over."
4,Great Alien Prequel,"Loved it. Filled in a lot of open spots for me. And, the movie was good on it's own too. Well done."
5,One of the best sci-fi films in a looong time.,I was completely blew away by this film. I am a huge fan of the first Alien and this film finally answered a few questions about where the xenomorph derives from. I will not tell much about this film only that it is definitely one of the best films of the year. It was also nice to see Ridley Scott return to the genre which he does the best. This film is definitely a must see for sci-fi/Alien film fans. I would categorize it as one of the best sci-fi films ever made and definitely the best of the 21st century.
3,Flawed But Entertaining,"This film is marred by a couple of gigantic plot holes, and it's not a very satisfying prequel to Alien. I think also that I've never seen another film that's more clearly intended to set up a sequel; even the Harry Potter movies provide more closure at the end. In spite of the problems, though, Ridley Scott is such a master of making gorgeous-looking cinema that it's worth watching. Michael Fassbender's performance as the childlike android is also a highlight."
5,Not really SciFi,"The 3D effects are great.It's not really SciFiIt might be considered religious allegoryIf there's a distinction (non-theistic?) then perhaps it's an updated/reworked Myth- after all that's the title, isn't it?"
3,Not in full screen,The movie itself is okay. Typical scifi. One thing I didn't like about the disc is that it doesnt show full screen on the tv. I bought it to watch first 3d movie on my new tv and quite disappointed that there were black bars at top and bottom of picture.
2,Silent film - comedy,"Turn off the volume and make up your own lines. Great space ship, graphics what have you and absolutely the most inept and ridiculous written story possible. Looked so much forward to this and it's crap. Bought it anyways - guess I shouldn't judge the inept writters without looking in my own mirror. Major disappointment that as a s-f fan, yet you'll will still purchase or rent."
2,"Movie should have been promoted as what it actually is, a prelude to ""Alien"".","So, I guess we are to assume that all this happened as a prelude to ""Alien""? If that is what Ridley Scott had in mind he should have said so while promoting the movie."
2,Weak attempt to recreate Avatar,"The film is ambitious in attempting to dethrone Avatar as the best religio-sci fi film. Whereas Avatar built on the notions of human foibles and the goodness of animism, complete the holiness of nativism, Prometheus devalues human existence by suggesting that we are the products of alien seeding. To slap us in the face a second time, the film goes so far as to say that we were a mistake and thus worthy of being wiped out by those who planted us on earth. The special effects are slightly above average."
3,Just ok,"It didnt make me scream out, it was bland at sometimes and I liked the ending alot that it wasnt finished at the end"
2,Ugh,"After watching Prometheus, all me and my friends could say is what was that and why should I care. I saw hollow ties to Alien, but nothing as good as the original.Don't waste your time or . Watch something else, or the original Alien."
3,Great Special Effects.,"I like special effects so I usually go with this type of sci-fi. Not really and ""edge of your seat"" movie like the Alien movies were but really close."
3,Prometheus,I was highly disappointed with the 3D effects. The movie in general was good though it has a good plot but not enough 3D
3,It is not Alien,I liked the Alien movies and story line and the details were great. Even with great special effects this pre-quel is not in the same category. It was OK and it gave a starting point to the other movies but it did not really give the detail you wanted as to why the race they found wanted to kill off other planet with bugs. It was so so. If you liked Aliens then you may want to see it for completeness but you could skip it.
3,Alien Beginning,"Not really what I was looking for, kind of a rehash of the Alien trilogy.... It was ok but for those of us who remember Alien, this was kind of its ugly step sister..."
3,Good waste of time,A little too long but the special effects were fantastic. Good rainy weekend movie to kill some time. Don't go out of your way to see it.
3,so-so,"story too fractured, not much character development, it's as if they tried to combine ideas from other sci fi movies and do too much."
4,real sifi,"Enter another ripley.plot easy to grasp,visual effects good.noomi rapace roll was a surprisingly great switch.prometheus should've been the very first intro to alien.sure to be a part2 and maybe room for 3."
4,Big Fan of the series but...,"It was a good movie. Wish it felt more like an ""Alien"" movie. Don't want to give more away. I would recommend watching it with the the mindset that it's a movie not a complete prequel of the series."
4,chest bust redux w/mild spoiler sauce,"Warning: attempt at thematic explanation ahead>>> May be rough going for some vieweres.Just as ice cream is packed full o'flavor, so Prometheus seems to be packed full o'themes. God. Man. Creator. Created. Oedipus. Charlize Theron. Umm. so. What a beyootiful movie. The budget on this. However, if one chooses to speculate on the nature of man (what about women?) and g-d, I imagine it's hard to do so without revealing personal bias. And, in the view of this particular viewer, I think it can be said the movie carries certain bias points about the nature of god. e.g., Why does HE want to kill us? Which from the point of view of this viewer, is a pretty brutal question to ask. The question of course, is answered in the next installment. As for the visuals, pacing, directing, etc.. very impressive. Of course, no Avatar, but, impressive."
3,A Disapointment In Most Every Way,"I can remember seeing Alien when it first came out - it was terrifing and remains one of my favorite films. With minimal effects and decades prior to CGI the superb performances, excellent writing and character driven piece set itself apart from virtually anything that came before or after.Promestheus is a visual powerhouse but it lacks the constant sense of dread ALIEN maintains throughout the run of the film. Reading about how much Ridley Scott wanted to test these same waters again. I was hoping for much more than the constant parade of parlor trick CGI and forgettable charactors. I can't recall a single one and although not having seen ALIEN in years there's not a moment or charector I can't forget .The reason is simple, we cared abut them and spent most of the film afraid for them. It's a disapointing journey from In Space No one Can Hear You Scream.... to In Space No one Can Hear You Snore."
2,Bad gimmick ruins a good movie,"I watched this movie twice in the cinemas and bought the Blu-ray disc. I really enjoyed the movie. But the gimmick included with the disc was extremely unsatisfying. I am fine if the disc does not come with digital copy. I am also find if it comes with only Ultraviolet (btw, I hate this concept!!!). But if you advertise it comes with digital copy please make sure the redemption code works! I got the first delivery and the code was invalid. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement disc free of charge BUT again the redemption code for the digital copy was invalid. How lucky am I to get 2 defective manufactures! Although I hate Ultraviolet, I gave it a shot and guess what - BOTH REDEMPTION CODES WORKED!!! Is this an attempt by the disc manufacturer to ...... forget it! Just disappointing."
3,Prometheus Blu Ray doesn't play in my BR player.,"I ordered this on Blu Ray and was excited to get it. Unfortunately, as I tried to start it up in my Samsung Blu Ray player, a message came up on the screen that I might have to update my player to be able to watch the movie, and it just wouldn't start. There is nothing wrong with my Samsung Blu Ray player which works beautifully and on which I can view 99.9% of my Blu Rays and DVDs. I think that if Prometheus' Blu Ray version is so ""updated and sophisticated"" as to be unplayable with an otherwise great Blu Ray player, there should be warning on the packaging and also in the product description front and center. This disc is useless to me now."
3,Aliens?,"The plot starts good, until the female scientist is impregnated by an ""alien?"". Where did this one come from? If you like SciFi, this is a good product."
2,Negative on Prometheus,"What happened to acting? Talent has been replaced by blood, gore and special effects. I had more fun with my Etch A Sketch when I was a child."
2,Hollywood Cliche,"If you're usually underwhelmed by the cliche story lines that are typical of Hollywood hits, you can feel good knowing that I just saved 2 hours of your life by recommending that you skip this one."
5,great,"great film and graphics were amazing, was a cliff hanger until the end would buy again, and reccomend to buyers"
4,Lots of fun but a little disconnected,"If you're a hardcore sci-fi fan you will love this movie.If you're a special effects junkie you will love this movie.I am neither, but I still very much enjoyed this movie.The acting is good. The directing is superior. There's plenty of action. The women are gorgeous and the men are (for the most part) heroic. The plot . . . well, it wanders a bit (at times I found myself saying ""Whoa! Did I miss something?"") but the film's better elements usually carry the ball past the plot's weak points. Don't look for deep philosophical perspectives or ethical conundrums; this is a fun film. If you're a devotee of the genre (or maybe just bored some evening) give it a try."
3,Started off great.....,I really enjoyed the beginning of the movie and I liked the concept. But further on with the scary monsters I got a bit bored. I feel there were so many other ways to have gone with this idea rather than the way they went.
2,Prometheus,"Special affects are good, predictable, rip-off of Alien(episode 1 ?), not enough Cherize walking to carry the movie. I should have waited for it to be aired, my youngest warned me."
2,Just OK,"A very long movie for the story. Very predictable and you can see other parts of sci-fi movies in this one. The ending was a let down. How the hell do you get and alien from the combo in the end, beats me."
2,Disappointed,It failed many ways. I've seen tv shows with better effects. Poor storyline. It is one of the two worst movies I've seen this year.
2,too far fetched,"We were pretty excited to see this film. It was entertaining, but once seeing the ships crew, became too far fetched. The story seemed to have too many holes in it. It could be really cool and is pretty good if you can look past the parts that make it totally not believable. It is entertaining all the same. Give it a watch and see if it's any good in your eyes. Not worth $3 rental in my eyes."
3,not great,average at best. boring in parts. confusing in others. i wouldnt recommend this to fans of Alien films - not really relevant to them
5,Excellent Movie!,"Excellent movie even if you haven't seen the ""Alien"" series. Excellent store line, graphics, cast and suspense. Ridley Scott is a master movie maker!"
1,Bad movie!,Not worth the money. Had some nice special effects but not worth the money. I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone.
1,Ouch! I got retconned right in the childhood.,"I might have given this film two stars for at least being pretty to look at, but I deducted one for the damage this did to the series. It's one thing if you're going to make a bad film that's more style than substance, with characters behaving frustratingly irrationally and 'science' so shoddy and lazy (e.g. ""we're half a billion miles from earth"") that I question whether anyone involved actually enjoys the genre. It's another thing entirely to make a bad film that retroactively alters the plot of another beloved classic. If you loved the Alien saga but thought it needed to be less interesting and more Christian, this is the film for you."
1,Wasted 2 Hours Watching This Crap,"Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. I just finished watching it and totally regret having my 2 hours wasted on a film with illogical story plot, too stupid characters who are supposedly scientists, bad dialog..."
2,What Happened Ridley Scott,THis movie is just bad from the beginning to the middle which is when I stopped watching it. It didn't make any sense and seemed to create more questions that couldn't possibly be answered coherently in a frenzied final scene or two.Really bad. Feel sorry for all the good actors that got duped into being in this one
1,Don't waste time,A poor movie with a sad premise. Something unexpected is found out so we shouldn't have any faith in anything?
4,Prometheus,"This movie provides a good background for the Alien movies. Nice story, good graphics. It is not about the Aliens, but about how the came to be."
4,A great flick!,"A great science fiction tale! Storyline, special effects and acting all first rate! Glad to have it in our library."
4,It was a present,My son loved it. Purchased for him for his birthday. He said he can follow with the Alien theme now.
3,I am not a fan of prequels,Honestly I didn't know who Noomi Rapace was so I tried to find out more. Thus its okay and she is a very good actress
4,Review,Interesting to great storyline. The director choose the one leading actor that could make this character believe able. No one but Naoomi but survey the wrath of a neo-god. I am looking forward to part two.
3,I was entertained.........and i really liked it,How many good alien/space/monster movies are out there.....a lot...and lots of themare thumbs down.... At least this movie is interesting...well directed and if youdont disect it and cry about everthing illogical you should be able to enjoy it.You have spaceships...alien ships...aliens....good production values.So ...dont think too much and enjoy a good movie.
1,Starts out OK. Then ruined by some of the stupidest scientists in existence.,Starts out OK. Then ruined by some of the stupidest scientists in existence.I could not finish this flick because of how idiotic the characters are. This might have been better if it was a comedy.The graphics were outstanding but the story just irritated me so I couldn't finish it.
2,A review just for the DVD,"For the movie itself I would give a 4-star rating, but then, I am a little biased as a big fan of the Alien series. Unfortunately, the DVD release of this film is very lackluster. The bonus ""Deleted and Alternate Scenes"" does not include all of the neat stuff you'll find on the Blu-ray edition: no alternate beginning, no alternate ending, no behind-the-scenes docs. I guess this is Scott's or FOX's attempt at forcing us to finally upgrade to Blu-ray players. It would have been nice to have known this information upfront, though. I would've spent the extra $5 on the double-disc edition and watched the extras on a friend's player."
3,I would really give it 3 1/2 stars,"This movie certainly has a place in the Alien story, although there are a few things I though could have been done better. Being a big fan of Alien and Aliens, I would recommend seeing it. Maybe not owning it but worth renting for Alien fans. I'm on the fence about the rating because the next morning I woke up running through the story over and over again in my head. At first I thought it was a 3-star, but the next day was thinking more of a 4. So... 3 1/2."
4,Prometheus Gives Fans Alien Reboot,"I am a fan of the movie Prometheus. It's fun to watch and the story entertaining and well written. The special features and commentaries are very informational satisfying even diehard fanboys. The digital copy is both iTunes and UltraViolet compatible. Download the movie to your hard drive or stream it via Flixster. Overall, my purchase of Blu-Ray/Digital Copy version was great and highly recommended."
3,Creepy and thought provoking,Prometheus. It was a sci fi adventure for sure. I thought it was a little too creepy and not a very good plot line
3,Not bad,Not a movie I would buy and keep in my collection but it wasn't a bad movie to kill an evening
3,Just believe I have seen this before,"Well done, just believe I have seen this before. Cross between Aliens and various other sci-fi movies. Will probably watch it again sometime."
3,Prometheus,Too long a film considering the plot. The storyline is rather far fetched and senseless. It's saving grace was in some very nice visual efftects.
3,okay,"Visually it's a beautiful film, but the plot line didn't add up or truly tie in to the first Alien film. Also a little slow."
3,The Franchise Continues!,"R.Scott had it all here the look and feel of an epic Sci-Fi/horror movie.Yet he failed to tell an epic story,in the amount of time given anyway.So what you get is your left waiting for the sequel or sequels.The franchise continues."
4,I liked it,"There are too many reviews of this movie claiming how ""unrealistic"" it is. This is not historical fiction people, it's science fiction. If you want a fun movie that's action packed with dazzling special effects, check it out. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and plan to watch it again and again."
3,Strange,"The movie itself was rather well shot, the actors not too shabby, but the story line is somewhat strange and the movie wanting. I believe less special effects and better dialogue would have done this movie alot of good."
3,Nothing to Get Excited About,"This is just another crap let's-cash-in-on-a-classic part of a franchise. Lot's of money and talent was poured into this effort with a so-so waste coming out of the spout. Good special effects that don't really mean all that much in the end. Story didn't strike me as particularly interesting. I could have had a perfectly fine life without having seen this movie, but seeing it didn't ruin my life either. It just wasted my time.I know. This is a halfhearted review, but it's all I need to say about PROMETHEUS."
2,Horrible,if you're gonna spend your money on this film don't spend a lot of money on it AND have another waiting in the wings to watch because this film is terrible and you're going to turn this one off!
2,blu-ray copy didnt work,the movie was okay but my blu-ray copy doesnt work. I have tried it on multiple ps3 and a new samsung blu-ray player.
2,Strange travels,I know I wont watch that movie a second time. The story is slow and seen many times over in the past. Special effects aren't very impressive and seeing an angry Charlize Theron is not why I like and Noomi goes off on her own with a disasembled humanoid in a UFO and who knows what she's going to eat while she's looking.
3,Interesting Sci-Fy,"This interesting version of the classic space exploration movie show the dark prequel to the original Aliens movie. Worth renting, but it has it's flaws."
3,started out good...lost it in the end,"This really had promise in the beginning. It was obvious there was an Alien prequel factor but the visuals were great and the atmosphere almost like 2001 a Space Odessy for a while. Then when the bad guys show up it took a turn for the worst and degenerated into a monster chase with way too much re-use of the same devices employed in several films in the Aliens franchise. Damn shame really, it could have been great if the vision had held, if some of the mystery had held...and, if the last creature had been less obvious"
5,Simply amazing!,I was extremely satisfied with this buy. I saw the movie 3 times in the theaters and just couldn't wait to get my Collector's Edition! The only thing I think is bad about this is the fact that I loved a lot of the bonus scenes and wish they had been added into the theatrical cut. I was also hoping for a director's cut or extended edition.
4,Better Than Expected,"Judging by the trailer, I didn't expect to like Prometheus that much but there was more of a story than i thought there'd be. There are still quite a few unanswered questions at the end, but maybe more intelligent people than me didn't think so."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it","Yep, I bought it and regret it. Just not a very good movie at all. Visually, it's stunning in parts but for the most case, I can't see why this movie was made."
2,Expect better,I would have expected better from Ridley Scott. Poor story and what was there did not flow well. The special effects were relatively good though
2,it is ok movie,"it is a good movie , but there are a lot of question marks . It does not follow a sequence and end it blahhh !! . Artistic wise it is a good graphic movie."
4,worth seeing again- awesome special effects,"Really enjoyed the movie, cant wait to see it in 3d on our TV at home! Good story to prequel the Alien series"
3,JUST THE SAME OLD THING,Was disappointed after seeing one of the trailers for it several months in advance. I thought it was going to be more than just another si fi outer space movie.
3,"OK, not as good as Alien","Beautiful picture, but old story. It is basically a horror film in space. The first Alien was much better. Fun to look at though I guess"
2,Nothing Different,There was nothing new in this storyline accept better special effects and better visuals aside from that the movie was unoriginal.-Lonnie
3,Ok movie,"The movie was not to bad , but alien was a much better movie for sure. I don't think I would ever watch it again was not good enough to see more than once"
3,The film is great but the disc quality is poor,"I enjoyed the film, but I am writing about the disc quality. I received the disc and it suffered from extreme pixelation of the video. I returned the disc to Amazon (the return process was excellent) and got a second disc, which suffered the same pixellation problem. Given the same problem on two different discs, I looked for a different solution. Turns out the firmware on my bluray player (a Sony BRD S360) needed updating to work with the disc. Works fine now."
1,Please don't spend the money,"I don't want to give away any of what would be called a plot, but this movie got worse the longer it went on. The best part of this movie was the cover art, well that and the closing credits"
3,"Entertaining, but...","I really couldn't get past a particular scene where the female protagonist makes her way out of a disastrous predicament and finds her way, covered in blood, to her shipmates and they don't really seem to react to her appearance, and she doesn't scream to the hills about what just happened to her(??????). It would have been a crucial plot revelation but it just came and went. I'm a sucker for ancient alien theories, so I would have seen this regardless of reviews, but I must say I was a bit disappointed by the film."
3,Untrustworthy,"I wouldn't watch this movie again....it needed to be a miniseries, as it is, you have to attempt to fill in not just gaps in terms of what makes sense, but in terms of characters, who they are, how they relate to each other, and what they go through.It was kind of like watching clips from episodes, of a jumble of patched together parts about people you didn't really know. Too many things made no sense....I felt cheated....that somehow the storytellers were untrustworthy....they never invested in character development and didn't give us enough for any of it to make real sense or be satisfying....I don't like that, and it was so promising at the beginning...."
2,Painful,"One of my fondest memories as a child was 1979 Alien in theater. I'll never forget the sound clunk clunk clunk of my Father brother and I smacking the back of our heads in total terror against the wall behind us in the last row of the theater as the alien erupted from the belly. I have always been a huge fan of sci-fi, horror, etc. Prometheus was really painful to watch. Almost void of terror, and really constantly unbelievable and at times just stupid and silly. Alien on the other hand was constantly feeding pure terror, and always realistic to the point of believable. Prometheus is unworthy of it's association with Alien. Quite frankly I am really disappointed with the terrible garbage hollywood churns out. Good movies are just so ridiculously rare these days. Yeah go ahead and rent this movie. What else are ya gonna do with $4, eat a McDonald's Cheeseburger. My how the end of times seems so near."
2,I was expecting much better from Ridley Scott,I gave it 2 stars for the special effects but the story was absolutely terrible. Not worth the time even if you are a big Alien fan.
4,5 star bluray/ 4 star movie,"First the bluray, the boxing is great, lots of special features, 4 disc for every viewing experience.Now for the movie, it is a great movie, for all of you haters this is a good movie that lives up to the alien franchise until aliens 3 and yes i do believe aliens 3 is a good movie though not lile the first two. How ever i think the movie fails in trying to sell you that it is not prequel, but believe me, it is a prequel mo matter how many times ripley says no. Because of this they changeg many thins so that it wouldnt connect directly to alien, i believe that if they made it a direct sequel it wouldve been more enjoyable. Overall this movie is great"
3,the product was good the movie was bad,It was a fine day for a bad movie as movies go but thats life in the fast lane to day.
3,So so,"Was good as a once over, but not really holding my interest. Interesting in places, but story was a bit boring."
4,Thought prevoking ending but lacking substance.,I liked prometheus although it was a bit predictable (I quess that is inevitable in a sequel). It did leave an open ending (once again) that invites one to contemplate... what else?
3,Bu-ray and DVD discs with failures,"The products in this order arrived on time, even sooner than expected which was great. Nevertheless, Prometheus Blu-ray and DVD discs presented defects and were impossible to play after minute 0:52. The image was totally pixeled on both cases. Rest of movies on the order were played without an issue"
3,Expected a little more,All in all a good movie. I would give a 3.5 but not a 4. Thus my reason for settling on a 3. I would recommend this for you science fiction addicts.
3,ehhh,"It wasn't what I was expecting... I was honestly expecting better, but it wasn't the worst alien movie I've ever seen. so it was just ok but I won't be buying the bluray or the download"
3,Very Alien-Like,"It is a good movie, but much more alien - like than I would have expected, ... Some nice special effects, and of course all set for a sequel"
2,De ja vu,"Seems to me, we've seen all this before??? Exploration, leads to terror, leads to monsters, leads to crew all dead, one female survivor !?!?! Come on Ridley, really...."
2,A waste of 2 hours,"Not much happens, none of it makes any sense, and it's unfinished (since it's the first of a planned trilogy). If you love sci-fi, don't watch this."
1,huge let down,Stupid story. Just a let down. Could of done so much more with the engineer interaction in the whole story. The different variances of the seed spiders from Alien was cool but that is the extent of my enjoyment.
3,So So Sci-fi,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie only to end up being disappointed. This movie had a lot of hype and the previews looked really good. The problem is the previews are about as good as it gets and the ending blew as did the action on the planet that was the supposed origin of humankind. It was a poor repeat of an ""Alien"" series movie. Rent it; don't buy it!"
2,Not What I Thought,"The movie was disappointing, sadly. Didn't really answer my questions, or my friends who watched it with me, about the origins of The Aliens. It kind of does but there were so many loopholes that we were both disappointed."
3,Bad Disk,The Blu Ray disk had some real issues. Had to use the standard DVD version. Will be exchanging for another one.
5,great prequel,I couldn't wait so I watched it and then watched it again the next day with the family. I loved it both times. The set up for the Alien movie was good allowing for its evolution.
3,"Good for Entertainment, But Not Great","I have recently watched this film, for the first time, on DVD the other day. And, the first overall impression was that it was ""rushed"" somehow, plus a lot of things in this film doesn't seem to make any sense. However, it's good for entertainment.Personally, I would prefer to see this film under James Cameron's direction."
3,not good watching movie,"we did not finished watching ,amazon had to rewind it to a piint we stoped watching the movie,, not very good >>"
2,seen this before,"I was excited to see Scott return to the sci-fi genre he has done so well in the past, but, through the entire movie I kept thinking "" haven't I seen this before?"" Oh yeah ""ALIEN"". Very disappointed to sit through what looked like a complete rehash with new staff and a lot more FX"
1,Stupid,Do not waste your money. It was slightly better than the old alien movies. To fake sci fi for me.
1,"So bad, I was laughing...","I doubt comedy was the intention of the film, but I found myself laughing out loud. This was awful. Truly awful. I love Alien and Aliens, and this, well this, is just awful. I have no other word to describe it."
1,Too full of stupid,"Great trailer, but the insipid decisions by the characters in this movie simply don't make sense for ""scientists"", and ultimately it feels like a movie about a handful of 20 year old punks in space- but without the campy fun of a horror flick. The plot makes no sense, the characters make no sensible decisions and (aside from noomi rapace) you don't end up like any of them or finding that their motives make any sense. Plus the movie is just full of bulls*** didacticism."
2,Prometheus,what a let down. waste of time and money. Its if the writers just took the old movie and redone somethings.
2,disappointed,"disappointed. expected it to be better. if there is nothing else to watch, this will fill the void. glad it was only 1.99."
2,"""Disappointment""","I expected this movie to be really good but instead i got a half baked attempt at a good scifi movie which vaguely explains anything and theres a hundred plot holes throughout that leaves the entire movie feeling unresolved. This was a one time viewing. Some people might like this movie though if your into b movie, irregularly paced films you might like this."
1,waste of time,Good special effects but incredibly slow and hard to follow. Never gets better but one keeps hoping... for scientists they were totally foolish!
4,Journey to a Dark Planet,"A mysterious ship glides through the outer reaches of the universe. Where are the crew going and hoping to discover? This film keeps us guessing what this commercial enterprise is really all about. It's dark and very creepy and mysterious yet visually stunning with references to mythology and the origins of life. Gorgeous and fascinating in its' telling, nevertheless the final is ambiguous and unsatisfying."
3,"Not bad,,Not good",Prometheus looked absolutely stunning but the story was very weak and predictable. Definitely is a movie worth checking out but if your looking for a great story your going to be disappointed.
4,It's a good Alien Pre-qual...,"If you are an Aliens fan like I am, then you will like this version of the origin of the Aliens saga. I has a very interesting construct, but not all the players are needed to support this journey. The CG work is very good and there are links to the tie original movie that help bridge the gap in time. Overall a very fun film to watch."
4,Great Blu Ray to Own for Some Alien Fans,"I think if you liked the Alien movies, enjoyed this movie in the theater, and would like to watch some new footage and get some of Lindelof's commentary, picking it up for 20 bucks or less is a great buy."
2,Had to watch three times,and still was a bit confused.....very puzzle like with lots of pieces missing. Seems like Ridley went for the money -- not the structured content we all like.
1,Waste of my time.,"This movie was such a waste. A waste of time for everyone involved in the making, and a waste of time for anyone who bothered to rent/buy it. I was severely disappointed. Bad writing, bad acting, and bad special effects. Sorry if anyone really liked it!"
1,Terrible,"This film is right near the top of my personal worst movies of all time list. It's noting more than a self-conscious remake of Alien (oooh! a humanoid android talking severed head with fluid dripping down its chin--what a clever reference Ridley!) as well as being a prequel. Full of non sequiturs, inconsistencies, contradictions, plot holes, and cardboard characters. It's not good sci fi. It's not even a good horror movie."
3,Prometheus,"I was told this was a great movie so I bought it. I watched it, but didn't love it. I ended up giving it to the person who told me it was great because I am sure I will never watch it again. They were thrilled with the gift and have watched it a number of times since I gave it to them."
3,Not as good as Alien but still good,I enjoyed this movie. Held my interest to the end. I will add it to my collection. I don't think this will disappoint any sci fi fans.
3,An Ok Watch,"I purchased this simply because I own all of the Alien films and I must say it wasn't quite what I expected. Originally it was intended to be a prequel to Alien, but Ridley Scott decided to make it a stand alone film. It didn't stand very well. It was interesting but not enough to rate it on par with Alien and Aliens. Good try but probably should've stayed with the original plan. It would have been more interesting as a prequel."
5,Great It was a gift,This was a wonderful Gift For My Brother he totally enjoyed this movie . I would recomend this movie to everyone
4,Well done movie,"I had seen the previews when this was first hitting the big screen and felt that it was going to be a good one, I was right. It held my interest from the start, the action was great, no dull moments. The best part was that it gave me another insight on the Alien & Predator movies and books, where did it start. But wait this is still not where it started, will there be another movie made showing the gal that survives following the trail back to the beginning, I hope so, I also hope someone really good at making these movies makes the next one just as exciting."
3,wat's up with the digital copy?,i was trying to redeem my digitall copy off itunes but it says the code was not valid. WTF??? pleaase let me know wat's going on??????as for the movie itself... magnifico!!!! excellente!!! WOW!!
3,Was Kind of Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this movie considering I hear a Part 2 is coming out. I didn't think there was anything special about the movie and I watched it in 3D! If you are buying this just for the 3D, save your money. If you already have watched the movie and like it but want the 3D, I didn't think they put a lot of effort in the 3D portion worth buying."
3,Expected more,"I really expected much more to happen in this movie. The acting was good but at the end of the movie, I was ""really?"" The special effects were almost null as well."
4,"Great movie, but needs a sequel","I loved this movie, but I really think that there needs to be a sequel, and Ridley Scott needs to just officially make this a prequel to Alien."
2,dull,"While it was interesting to see a movie that set the stage for the original Alien movie, it's not like this film adds anything to that film (which is much much better). While I'm generally a fan of science-fiction movies, and even have an appreciation for 2nd rate sci-fi films, as the film continued it seemed dull to me. Once the 'aliens' take over the film in the second half, there's really not much question about what's going to happen."
3,Alien prequel,Story is a little dis-jointed. Actor are good especially the women. Good special effects. Still unsure of the engineers and why they were so hostel to humans. They created humans then want to destroy us?
4,great film...,Thought provoking and an interesting prequel in the alien franchise. the deleted scene when the alien answered david should not have been cut... it could have gone into more depth.
3,Very disappointed.,I will echo most of the reviews here. The special effects are great. The lighting and mood are perfect for this type of movie. THE PLOT STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN! I am so glad We did not drop $50 to see this at the theater. I feel cheated at $20 for the DVD.
2,I want my 2 hours back,"What a waste of a movie, it was lame and very very predictable, a total loser I told my friends not to waste their time and I am a SciFi nut"
3,This movie was slightly entertaining.,I had to watch it a couple times because I kept falling asleep through it. Suspension of disbelief can only go so far and this is just beyond that periphery. It's a very very weak story.
5,Good Times,"Thought it was a good movie, not perfect but kept me entertained.Comes with both Blu-Ray and DVD, which should be standard for all the bigger movie releases.Arrived in perfect condition and being that it took a month (due to military deployment) that's really good."
5,Not as scary as Aliens,"Not as scary as Alien movies,(to which this is a prequel). But VERY interesting! I cant wait to see the next one. I am a die-hard Alien fan so I loved it. If you liked Aliens for the jumpy factor, this is not for you. IF you like sci-fi puzzle and a little action, space-ship to unknown kinda thing? This is for you. And you find out how those aliens were made in the first place."
4,Movie,"We remote this movie in Thanksgiving. I thought the plot was good but there were a few scenes that didn't make sense to the movie. As for the Alien movies go, it was the best one yet! It really gives you food for thought on the creation of life. The quality of the movie was awesome! We had no problems with the download or the play of this movie."
5,"Best Sci Fi Movie in a Long Time. Requires Thinking & Several Views To ""Get It""",The reviewers didnt like this movie but who cares? I loved it and have seen it several times. each viewing reveals new details and plot twists. The extras disc is essential as some of the deleted material is critical to the story. I hate it when they chop up a movie to make it fit in a commercially acceptable length. This movie should have been longer and not had some key details removed. The videography is fantastic. This blu ray is a star.
3,ok SF,Enjoyed the film for the most part but the ending was kind of unsatisfying. The alternate ending did at least explain one mystery. I did not believe the heroine's motivation (What would charlie do?) for further risking her life and limb.
2,digital stops and starts,3d copy start and stop start and stop for about half an hour.had dust and fingerprints all over it.cleaned it up but no difference
5,A masterful film from the Alien universe,"One of the best films to come from the Alien world in years and a return of the original Alien director, Ridley Scott. The movie has excellent 3D cinematography, concept and direction. Best for those that follow the first Alien movie but written as a new science fiction story that stands on its own. I hope they follow through with a next chapter and stick with Ridley Scott's direction."
3,movie,I don't know; this is a gift that was requested. I'll have to find out from the receiver. Thank you.
5,Good space horror,I watched it in the theater and bought it again online. You will like this movie if you're into space horror and scifi this movie is nicely dark.
4,Quite good.,"Liked it even better when discovered it was something of a prequel to Aliens. If that had been announced and hyped more in the description of this film it would have went a long way to preparing and explaining to viewers, as well as creating a buzz and interest."
3,Disappointed - Expected Better From Ridley Scott,"I think Ridley Scott relied too much on his ""smoky, low-audio discourse, darkly-photographed with horrific creatures"" formula that was so successful in Alien and Blade Runner. What for this one to come to a subscription viewing source (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc)."
5,great movie,"great movie, different...not same old thing. good filming/effects. Fast moving, not dull, I would watch it again and I don't say that about many movies."
4,Good suspenseful fun,Great film if you like suspenseful fun and the Alien series.And if you can suspend your disbelief at very dangerous and irresponsible decisions made by the characters in this movie. SO with that said- enjoy an evolving plot and backstory to the Alien franchise- with great effects and a good dose of mystery.
4,A worthy effort,"Though not the full-on Alien sequel or prequel that true Alien die-hards had hoped for, Prometheus is nonetheless a more than worthy effort and a return to form for the Grandmaster of Science Fiction, Ridley Scott."
3,not the hype,was disapointed with this movie was quite a let down 3 d effects were okay but the story sucked and the whole movie was set in dark tones not much in the wat of color depressing
1,Not worth the time....,Not worth the time. Not very science oriented. Nothing to think about after being bored to death. I would rater see the Day Earth Stood Still again. Or how about 2001.
5,Alien prequel,"It's totally an alien prequel. Sorry if I spoil that for some of you but I knew ahead of time and it made me pay attention even more. Get it, great movie!"
4,movies,"Good movie,the alien baby was kind of crazy,but overall it was a good movie,I also liked the ending,now we know how Alien began."
5,Great Movie,Bought this for my husband as he was very interested in the movie when it came out and he really enjoyed it. Great that it was in spanish aswell
4,What about the end?,"Prometheus tells a much bigger story and does it well, but it's missing what matters most. It's inorganic. A fascinating - and at times frustrating - film."
4,Prometheus,"I'd heard mixed reviews prior to and during the theatric release of this film and opted to wait. When it came available on Blu-Ray, I decided to take a chance and purchase the title rather than wait to view it first via rental. I was not disappointed. The film does an excellent job of showing the sequence of events that would later lead to the Nostromo discovering the huge abandoned spacecraft in the movie Alien. I did knock my rating down one star because of one major detail glitch in the Prometheus: SPOILER ALERT - the alien pilot should have died in the seat of his own spacecraft and not on the floor of the company lifeboat to properly bridge into 'Alien'. Nevertheless, it also shows how the 'Aliens' that infect their hosts will mutate based upon the hosts they take. The cinematography and action was all well-done, I've now watched the movie several times and can highly recommend it."
4,good movie,"I would thought I might hate it, but I quite enjoyed it. It was a great sci fi movie to watch with the family."
2,Over hyped by the critics,"A disapointment. Not without some merit, but not close to the Ridley Scott's greatest works. No Blade Runner, or even Alien, here."
3,I just wish...,"...someone had told me before I walked into the imax that it was a b horror movie, a mere prequel to aliens. I would have enjoy it much more. Instead i was told by the ticket guy that it was very scientific with a provocative story, and that he couldn't wait to see it again. Aside from that, my fundamental issue with the movie is that a corporation would pay so much money to send a bunch of idiots to a distant planet. Those so called scientists and professionals were extremely... unprofessional. Oh, let's take off our helmets! There's oxygen! It was really tantamount to sending a bunch of actors to a distant planet to do scientific research (which they did :-). It didn't have to be so completely dumbed down. Filming making has long since surpassed good story writing, and it's a little pathetic. So much resources and money go into the dumbest things these days. That said, I adore michael fassenbender. Also well done on the visual experience."
1,Big Disappointment,"This film was a huge disappointment. Flat characters with no development; a plot that was so predictable I was almost able to say the lines of the characters as they were talking! There were several inconsistencies throughout the film (i.e., scares appear then disappear). The religious overtones were also over the top. All in all the film was a big disappointment and a let down."
2,Prometheus HD,Not much to say about this one. I'm not sure why Ridley Scott had his name on this one. No wonder it was so quick to video from the theaters
1,Don't bother,Just read the one star reviews...all I can say is ditto and do not bother buying this movie...it is just garbage.
1,Complete,"Amazon, you didn't let me post this comment the first time on grounds of profanity. If BS is profanity, check this link out; it has BS in it, too. Don't worry, you're not gonna have any problems seeing it, it's all in CAPS.I'm sure there are hundreds more with BS in it out there . So, my review of this piece of junk, is complete BS. Learn something from youtube.http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR7AA4A6MD3U/ref=cm_pdp_rev_more?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReview#R3M3NSGXUKGTYT"
3,Ok Sci Fi Flick. Not what I was hoping.,"The previews made this seem like a riveting addition to the series , even more so than the A vs P movies in the franchise. There are some beautiful images here but the lack of character development really kills this potentially awesome movie. The plot disappoints also. I really wanted to like this movie but uncharacteristically Ridley didn't allow that to happen. Wait for the price to drop and pick it up on sale."
2,Alien movie Not satisfactory,"Was looking forward to this movie for sometime, did not get to see it this summer so I waited and waited, for its release this last week, and found I was waiting for a bomb of a move, Not up to par as the aliens movies its suppose to be! I rather have watched alien resurrection, now that was a great movie, This was not. special effects were great. but I could of wrote a better plot! even the first Alien movie was better than this it had a story. the ending was weird, and was hoping for a better flick. Sorry, but was not worth the wait or the money."
5,"This movie is Ridley's original concept, and its supposed to leave you with nothing.","This is a remake as well as a prequel to Alien franchise. It will leave you with nothing just to lead you to the remake of Alien. All together visually stunning, Ridley Scott is a well known visual director. F.Y.I original concept to Alien is invovled."
1,Don't waste your money with this movie!,"I am sorry to say this but this movie could've been better produce, it was jumping back and forth in plot ideas and creatures that none of it really made any sense except for the engineers. Then they throw a alien creature at the end answering none of the questions about the creatures themselves or nothing."
1,Why space is a vacuum,"I gave this film one star only because Amazon wouldn't let me post this review with a zero star rating. I am embarrassed for Ridley Scott. Either he has completely lost his touch or feels such an abiding contempt for his audience that he could not be bothered to make a good movie. Prometheus is among the worst collection of disjoint false starts, unkept promises, and unmotivated action to appear on the screen this century. I have no idea how many writers actually worked on the script, but it is clear that they never spoke to each other. I would characterize Prometheus as a multi-million dollar work of mediocre fan fiction clumsily based on the movie Alien. About twenty minutes into the film I caught myself looking for the slide bar at the bottom of the screen, only to remember that I was actually in a theater. This film may be why space is a vacuum, and anyone who likes movies should hope that no sequel of this jumble of mismatched cliches and set pieces is ever made."
1,Waste,"A minimum of 6 subplots that go nowhere. 80% of Hollywood films have 1 or 2 subplots that go nowhere. Here, you get disappointed about every 10 minutes starting about the 30 minute point. One pointless moment after another. I guess that is what a secular Hollywood has become. I go to very few movies and blew it going to this one. I was close to walking out. Don't see it, don't buy it. Some really gruesome stuff anyway."
1,Absurd,I'm not gonna go on and on about the movie. There are plenty of bad reviews here that relay my feelings of this horrible movie. One tidbit I will add is the absurdity of two characters...one was a geologist...that wanted to go back to the ship instead being involved in this momentous occasion of discovering life on another world. Just ridiculous.
2,Very disappointing - save your money :=((,This is definitely not up to the superb level of Scott's previous work. Starts with a fascinating story line which very quickly gets completely forgotten and degenerates into a second rate ripoff of Alien 1.
1,Derivative,Not an original idea in the film. He must have needed some cash to pay for the Porsch. Aliens in the stomach! How original!
2,"I enjoyed the visual effects, but the story was full of plot holes.","I like to think that I pay decent attention to details in a movie. I didn't enjoy Prometheus because I felt that too much was left unexplained during key moments. I don't mind a movie which leaves you with questions, but important scenes in the movie felt as if they happened by chance. My biggest judgement for the movie were the plot holes. In my opinion they easily stand out and the movie isn't the least apologetic about it."
2,Watch it if there's nothing else on,"If this was produced way back when the first Alien films were I'd have rated it higher. In today's film climate it was really nothing new. Same old story rehashed, similar effects. I'd rather roll out the original Alien and watch that again."
1,Save your money and your rage.,"I saw this movie opening night. What can I say, other than I laughed through the last three quarters of the film. It is obviously made to be taken seriously. And if your idea of a great, intellectually stimulating movie is ""power rangers"", then this is for you. With out spoiling any of the plot, if you can find one, this is basically a slasher film in space. ""Scientists"" (and this term is used very loosely) go into space seeking first contact. The crew of the first ever interstellar ship is manned with people from an insane asylum, and sent to investigate alien ruins. It would have been a much better film, if it had been shot with Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler as the lead."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Unless you are a HUGE fan of the Alien movies do not waste your time on Prometheus. Even then, be warned. Bad sets, special effects, and horrible writing mar what should have been a great start to the prequels. There are so many plot holes it will drive you insane. A huge disappointment."
1,"Poor story, Poor script, and unnecessary gore",I've seen much better written and produced sci fi; for example Aliens/ Aliens 2/ and Aliens Resurrection.The story needed a lot of improving as did the writingSpecial effects were over the top trying to hide a B movie
3,A conceptual sci-fi drama,"Prometheus does not fit neatly into any one film genre. It is part science fiction, part fantasy, largely a talky drama, a suspenseful thriller and a philosophical study. It is choppy at times but still entertaining. It is not a prequel but a mirror of a prequel in that it introduces one into the universe that later spawns the alien menace. The director does ring in Weylund Industries, the moon-like celestial system that the Nostromo will later investigate, the race that made the Alien, and the concept of invincibility and eternal youth and strength. Overall, it is an interesting idea but it will need more films to fully develop the concept and to bring us up to the Nostromo story. The folks hear tried to outdo themselves and instead have now created an unfinished story."
4,Spectacular!,"Imaginative and insightful, Prometheus offers up the best of sci-fi adventure. Scott gives the audience plenty of eye candy and action while also giving the brain something to chew on. Can't wait for more!"
4,great movie,"Wife and me wanted to see at the movies but alas there were alot of movies to see so we waited on this one till it came out on blueray..was a very nice experience and we both loved the movie and expect to see more maybe about this movie series.I will not give away any info except that it does start it all but leaves room for more prequels and or new directions for the future and we will see what comes next.Acting greatsome stuff proves you can still be stupid but be an engineer..talking to alien thing that snaps at you.....idiot, learn to run away live for sequel.the visuals were outstanding and the spaceship was believable."
1,What the F did I just see,"There was no logic in this ""plot"" whatsoever. Many of the events in the movie happen for apparently no reason and are left unexplained.SPOILERS (actually nevermind, just read them and skip the movie): Having sex with a person infected with an alien virus(?) makes you pregnant with a squid, even if you're previously infertile? Just one of the many scenes that will leave you wondering what the scriptwriters were on when they wrote this.Stay for the deleted scenes! Why the heck did they delete those scenes?? They were at least a weak attempt to explain why they were even there in the first place or why the alien suddenly went berserk."
3,Not impressed,"The movie was OK. Builds up to nothing... some people may really like it while others will hate it. Not bad, but not as good as I expected."
1,One of the worst films I've ever seen,"Prometheus is a disaster. Terrible, incoherent script that insults your intelligence. Its like Ridley and Damon Lindelof didn't even bother and were in a rush. Lindelof is the traitor who destroyed LOST by basing it on false promises and undelivered expectations. He continues his legacy with Prometheus. Don't reward bad film making by renting this film. Don't encourage them."
1,Terrible movie,This movie was absolutely terrible! I can't understand why people actually liked it. Boring from start to finish with a terrible pace. I don't recommend it...
5,The Wild Ride Begins,"This movie was eagerly anticpated by me and did not disappoint. A great sci-fi prequel laying the foundation for the Alien series, the only thing it lacked was Sigourney fighting the devils spawn. Don't you just hate it when people youv'e grown to love get old. The BluRay was great!"
1,So much potential - sigh.,"Zero plot and/or character development.Huge logic breaks.Outdoor' special effects were very limited.Horrible acting - in particular, but not limited to Charlize Theron.I really was looking forward to this.A shame, really."
2,"watchable, but............","As I previously stated this movie is watchable, but that's about it. As a suspense/thriller it disappoints. As a member of the Aliens family, it makes little sense. Do not expect to be wowed. No great acting, not visually awesome. Simply meh."
2,not good,bought it for my husband then found out it had another one that has 2 dvd's and then another one with more... too confusing....he watched it twice did not like it...
3,alien prequel,This movie is a prequel to alien but directer Riddle Scott says it' not a prequel to alien it's an OK move not as good as alien
2,let down spoiler,"keeping this short. this movie was a large let down, it was so obvious that the story line was not original. It had pieces tack on especially the end. Not the CG was astonishing. the character one dimensional. and I'll just leave it like that. better to view it that to own it."
2,full of cliches,There wasn't much innovation in this movie. I understand that it is a prequel for alien series but it was less than impressive due to a lack of originality in numerous concepts it was trying to sell. It was disappointing despite its pretty visual effects.
4,"Surprising twist . . . which I won't reveal, so as not to be a spoiler...","...I certainly didn't expect that; overall, this was a good movie; couple of the characters are predictable and stock, and thus less enjoyable; some are distastefully shallow (but then, I've met my share of those, too); special effects are good... I'm not overly critical of science fiction movies, because I love the genre, and especially because of all the dreadful ones I saw in my childhood and early adult years. This one's definitely a keeper, as is almost anything Ridley Scott directs, but I wouldn't put this near the top of his efforts."
2,mega disappointment,"I waited and wanted this movie to be awesome. It fell so flat. The plot was more hole filled than 10 swiss cheeses. It bordered at times ona spoof and seemed cut to shreds. Fassbender is awesome and lends a lot of presence to what ends up being a kind of teen envinment studies nightmare. The hard scifi grit is repalced with an almost liberal arts science expedition attitude mixed with oh my gosh evil corporate plot that never materializes. The deus ex machinas motivations are murky at best and the audience is just supposed to accept all the coincidentaly, unlikely, sappy bs thrown at it without a lick of respect as to the intelligent viewer. If they had spent a little more time writing th eplot, and slightly less on marketing everyone would have been happier."
1,Poor quality,Getting it in HD made it have to stop and reload over and over. It was really frustrating. Big sure if I will rent a movie like that again.
2,Not Good,"Awful casting, Bad writing, disjointed. Watched once that was enough. Story doesn't flow characters are incredibly stupid for people who are supposed to be smart. Good special effects."
2,Mistake,"Weakly carved plot, poorly written dialog, and irritating shards of pop-culture slop thrown in. Not likely appreciated by those looking to enjoy pure sci-fi. Wasted my time and money on this."
1,Crap,"This movie really sucked. There's barely a plot and it's poor at best. It keeps paying homage to Alien, and really who cares? How about creating a decent movie in it's own right? Save your money."
2,What a Let Down!,"I enjoyed the movie until the end. The scientist and the talking head go into outer space to find the ""creators"" who don't like us? Get over it!"
4,Better the second and third time through,Theres so much going on in the movie it's easy to miss details that get lost in the massiveness of the movie.
3,prometheus,Worth a first viewing. Not worth a purchase for a home library. Left the door open at the end for a sequel so you won't leave completely satisfied.
3,Another Pretentious Film from Ridley Scott,"I believe that Ridley Scott has been living off of his laurels since making Blade Runner, probably his best and most original film. Gladiator wasn't bad but Russell Crowe made that movie. It seems that every time he makes a movie it gets lots of (undeserved) attention. This movie doesn't have the visceral atmosphere and excitement of the first two Alien movies, which were sheer fun to watch. In fact it is rather dull and attempts to be 'deep,' which is part of its problem. I'm not sure we care all that much about these big white men coming to earth to create us.The special effects are fabulous. But there are enough holes in the plot to drive a spaceship through. I didn't get the part about the attack on the ship from those two dumb scientists who were left behind because of the storm and then possessed by the alien entities."
4,Great shots of Iceland.,"OK, good flick, great special effects and the aliens have been refined to an art. But I was expecting a better story, one more paced and perhaps more original--this one leaped forward to a succession of familiar story lines, almost to a more elaborate rhyme/repeat of the original Alien. Grand celestial stores that come to revolve around us diminish rather than elevate ultimate questions."
1,"prometheus asks all the important religious questions, such as ""who created us?"" and ""can i have my cross necklace back?""","wow what a deep deep movie. its depth more than makes up for the horrible pacing. the characters range from unlikeable to flat out idiotic which is always the hallmark of an intellectual film. oh wait, i forgot about the redshirts. there are a LOT of redshirts in this movie. at one point a creature comes back to the ship and wastes a whole bunch of people and for the life of me i didnt know what any of their names were. i asked someone who is a fan of the movie and i believe their names were ""mercenary 1, mercenary 2, mercenary 3, and mercenary 4"". well at least its pretty to look at. if you like painted turds, this movie is for you."
4,A solid Sci Movie,"This movie appeals to a narrow group of sci fi lovers. It has great visuals and graphical design work. After watching additional movie scenes on this blu ray that were cut from the original theatrical version I question ""why weren't some left in""?..... they could have really added to the depth of the movie. Also I wish they would have better pursued the theme of ""creation vs evolution"" as that is one thing that really stands out in this prequel."
3,bad acting,"This movie is like a remake of alien. Acting in this is boring, the special effects are good, plot needs more imagination."
2,It has all been said... Nonsensical!,"Prometheus is a movie the makes you wince as you watch. The behavior of the ""biologist"" on board a trillion dollar mission? A contaminated mission leader who tries to hide his contamination? Major surgery followed by running and jumping? Another decapitated android? Aliens that can grow in the absence of calories? And on, and on, and on...Good grief, Charlie Brown!This was the first, and only, movie I purchased while on a airline flight, and that time through I thought both the screen size and the airline editing must have affected my perception of the movie and plot. Then I just finished watching it in HD yesterday.I nominate Prometheus for a Razzie Award. Any seconds?"
2,Don't waste your time!,"Although the film was visually stunning,the film was poorly written, the characters were not very believable and I found it difficult to sit through the entire film. I just felt like it was a terrible waste of my time."
4,Better than expected,"Movie was better than expected, likely due to the lackluster reviews by some who had high expectations of closure with respect to the Aliens series. I liked it. From what I see, it appears to be a prequel to the Aliens series and provides a split, or a parallel story. I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel to this movie where the origin of the ""Engineers"" or the motive for transporting alien creatures to Earth is pursued. As expected, awesome special effects."
4,Contemplative Sci Fi,"Interesting, thought provoking felt like the last thirty minutes would have been a great start point for the film, still enjoyed it though."
5,Sci-fi take on where we came from and how it ends,I really enjoyed the origin story with this movie. It not only portrays where the aliens come from and their purpose but where we come from in this sci-fi take. It was slow at times but the story is interesting and well done. The visuals are extraordinary! Highly recommend this movie.
4,Hope there's a good sequel,"Good flick, definitely makes you think. The ending was kind of open ended, and didn't explain much which is why I hope there is a good sequel."
2,Surprise to me...BORING!,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. First, Ridley Scott is top notch as a director. Second, I love sci fi, especially scary sci fi. I generally like 3d as well. So I went to see it in 3d.Let's start with the 3d. I think animated movies look the best in 3d. Live action movies are rated by me as good, to poor. Avitar is the exception which I thought was great. I rate the 3d in Prometheus as fair.The movie itself started out to make me think this was going to be really good. Instead, as the movie dragged on, I found it boring most of the time. Alien is a movie this is compared to. There is no comparison. Alien held my interest from beginning to end. This movie did not. Maybe it's because there was too much reminiscent of Alien. For me, this wasn't very original.For all the 5 star raters, I think you are very generous."
2,Disappointed..,"I expect much more from a futurist sci fi movie these days. I initially reviewed it with 3 stars but after thinking about how little sense the movie made, I am downgrading it to two."
1,Garbage,"This was a very horrible movie. Tried to put a back in time movie with thw future. Plus stole a scene from Aliens which I still don't understand why it ended the way it did. Horrible, horrible, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage ass movie."
2,Stupid people doing stupid things.,"All the spectacle and beauty on the screen was undone by the moron actions of the ""scientists"" on the Prometheus team. This script is an insult to scientists. As for the rest of the crew, apparently in the future people unemployable in even the 20th century will get hired as starship crewmen. A real disappointment."
1,yawn. what a bore. not SF or even horror. just plain pathetic.,"I waited for this embarrassment?Yikes. At least I didn't make it to the theater with my $10 and only had to pay here to watch it. I kept looking at the time counter, hoping it was wrong and that I didn't have another hour to watch, then 45 minutes more, then 10 minutes.This movie was boring. yawn.Answer questions? yes,Q: just how gullible is the movie ticket audience?A: This guillible."
5,wow what a movie,this is not in my to 10 movies of all time but it is a very good si-fi movie. very well made and looks good. well worth the time to watch it
1,Fell far short...,Overwhelmingly this movie fell far short of its potential. I was disappointed with the disjointed plot lines and the overwhelming lack of attention to detail. It was frustrating to see the culmination of what began as a genre maker (Alien) come to this.
2,Aweful Movie,"If you haven't seen this movie, go ahead and rent it and be disappointed.The stories are just so disconnected. Nothing makes sense and related to the whole movie as far as the stories go. There is no action. There is very little special effect. Everybody plays very little part to the entire movie. I feel like they chops up the whole movie and then stitches the pieces together in the wrong places.So, the movie is supposed to be about going to look for God; but this is not.It is like seeing a slightly better budgeted B-movie. So disappointed.2 stars."
2,warm milk,with great expectations this was purchased ! After 1/4 of the movie watched the realization hit me! Just a remake of Alien and basically the same story line just different characters and and a little twist to the overall plot! Not meaning to rain on amazons parade but I am thankfull I purchased it here and did not waste time and money to see it in theaters or pay the over price amount to purchase a hard copy
3,Great Visuals,"I am afraid that Ridley Scott gave the public a mediocre rating, because it made me squirmto imagine that we sent representatives of all humanity into space, to potentially meet ourcreators, who then behave like they are on a hunting vacation. Still liked the special effects."
1,Boring,"This was slow, boring, and illogical. What a waste of time. Good thing I only rented it. Was anybody able to sit through this to the end in the theater?"
2,Really good movie BUT!,I purchased this movie thru amazon video due to the fact that I didn't have the opportunity to watch it on the big screen. It was an early release and digital only.The movie itself is really good. All the CGI is pretty awesome and the story really gets you involved.I regret buying this movie thru amazon digitally. First half hour or so it was perfect then it started lagging and giving connection issues. I went to my PC and did a speed test and got 30mbps did it thru the PlayStation and got 25 too. So it was not on my side yet I had to keep restarting my connection so that amazon refreshed my IP.Amazon needs to get more professional talent to work on this software as it is laggy and poorly arranged. As a result I will never buy another early digital release and will buy only bluray discs. Until now u can't beat that contrast.
1,Prometheus review.....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!,"Should have know that if Ridley Scott was the producer, that this copy cat movie would be like all his Alien movies! If you've seen all the original 'Alien' movies, then you don't need to waste your money on Prometheus! It's story line and characters are identical to all his past movies! Right down to the female survivor, the android robot who loses his head and still can talk and think like a human, and even the ending made absolutely no sense! The ""creature"" gives birth to a baby ""Alien"" from the original movies, but the ""creature"" looks nothing like the baby that just popped out of it's stomach!! (Maybe this ""creature"" had an extra marital affair...who knows!) It was a total waste of time and money. Paid $15.99 for it and if you want it for $5...let me know! There's two hours of my life that I'll never get back!!! Save your money and bypass Prometheus!!!"
1,Doesn't work,DVD copy doesn't work in 3 out of our 4 DVD players. The one it does work in isn't connected to a TV. Thanks for nothing!
1,The movie could be good if Amazon can get it to stream,"Haven't seen the movie. It would never run over my roku even though it is a model Amazon claims will work. The customer service is ill equipped and had no idea how to get it working and then they promised follow-up that never was sent. When it works it works, when it doesn't Amazon has no plan to help."
3,Not as good as I hoped,While Prometheus was not a bad movie it was deffinately not as good as I hoped it would be. Most of the action you have already seen in the preview I would rent it rather than buy it
4,Great effects.,I am a scifi buff. If u like et type movies ur love this one. Even dough some of the storyline is a little confusing but a little searching online will clear it all uo
3,promethus,"Only if you are an Alien fan would you be able to follow and appreciate this movie. Since I am, I throughly enjoyed it. I found that if you missed even a small part of it you will be lost and wouldn't understand what's going on. Overall, I enjoyed it as a sci-fi movie. It had a different spin to it."
4,Awesome!,Finally find out how Aliens species came to be. - Good stuff! I would highly recommend it for those who like the Aliens series of movies.
4,Latest/Greatest Installment,"I'm a lifelong devotee of the Alien franchise and I wasn't sure what to expect after such a long break. I must say, I was quite impressed. Prometheus has all the creepy horror of the past films, but delves further into the weird psychological aspects of that universe as it explores the origins of the xenomorphs Ripley fought, as well as other related creatures. Rumor is that the next film, if there is one, will take off on a completely different story branch - not the one that begins with the birth of the first Alien as we know it, late in this movie, but something new and unexpected. Fingers are crossed!"
3,Interesting but left me a little confused,"It was nice to see where the Aliens came from however even that left me a little confused as to how so many could have been created. The plot seemed to go in too many directions with it lacking direction, maybe they wanted to leave their options wide open for the next in the series. Overall entertaining."
4,unbound,"a good movie to rent,super and far reaching special effects, great premise and a tense ending that downt leave you hanging"
3,could've been better,"It could've been better. I think they may have been resting on the laurels of the ""Alien"" legacy. I had to go on wikipedia to track down what was being implied through part of the movie. It's a good movie for the Alien die-hards, otherwise not-so-good."
4,"Good 3D, better than alot of them.","Worth getting, did not think that it was too gorry or violent. Pretty cool 3D. Plot was OK, but not great."
3,eh!,"The human antomaton should have been a real robot. The special effects were good, the plot was good, but it didn't blow me away."
4,Don't understand the hate!,"I thought this movie was really good, not great, but really good. I watched it three times in one week and still found myself thinking about it. There are a lot of layers here and the extra content does a great job of filling in the blanks. I can't wait to see where this goes and will be looking forward to Prometheus II.Crazy visuals, stuff that sticks in your head.Great Story... explained a lot of the Alien loopholes."
3,Ridley could use some new material,"I am sure that folks who are die hard Alien series fans were wanting a prequel. Personally, that wasn't something high on my list for movie content, however, this was an interesting walk through. The visuals are excellent but not exceptional. The story is missing development of the 'master race' of beings which I found to be a nagging disappointment throughout the viewing. That said, I imagine fans of sci-fi and the Aliens movies will be entertained and find this a worthy couple hours spent."
4,Extra discs=More cost?,"I purchased this edition of Prometheus because I wanted the bonus material. As a huge Alien fan, I very much enjoyed this movie in the theaters and wanted to get answers to my questions. I liked the voice overs during the bonus material. I even downloaded the Prometheus app to my phone and found it cool that I could interact with it from my phone. My only complaint is why did I have to pay for the 3D and regular DVD versions? I guess they now package all of this together to keep everyone happy, but if it adds to the bottom line for me, then I don't think that is very consumer friendly. Maybe the company doesn't want to spend money on creating various versions or wants to include what you really want in this one. In either case, I was happy w/the material I wanted, but not so happy with the extra DVDs I wont be using."
5,LOVE IT!,"I had been following the development of this movie since the original script, which I wish they would have implemented. But alas, it was still an amazing movie! I would put it in my top 5 :-)"
2,Pass on this 3D and buy the standard edition,I would recommend the standard version of this movie. The movie its self is good but the 3D effects are minimal and far from impressive. It looks as though they put just enough in to get the 3D stamp. If you're looking for a movie to show off your 3D setup check out the Avengers 3D.
2,want my money back,This movie suck it was advertised as full of action it was not I had to sit though two hour of crap
2,Prometheus review,A good movie to fold laundry to or wash the dishes or clean the bathroom or make the beds or have on in the background while vacuuming.
2,Visuals exceed plotline,"Great visuals and promise but thin plot line and substance; very basic and overdone SF baseline; over theatrical; stereotypicalcharacters; pandering to audience. A let down from the previous opus work 'Aliens"" series."
2,No real plot,"No plot, but good effects can't make up for that. Seemed only a carrier to convey ""alternate creation theory"" lol."
3,Poorly edited,"There was way too much going on, and not much portrayal as far as the characters as to who they were, etc."
3,Too many questions,"I love Ridley Scott, he is probably one of my favorite directors. This movie has stunning visuals and effects, but the plot itself was lacking. I was left with too many why questions? It is possible that the references were too subtle to catch the first time through, but I was looking and expecting a lot more."
3,Not what I thought it would be.,Too much like a remake of another movie. I thought it was gonna be something completely different. But the effects and scenery are wonderful.
4,worth watching,"I enjoyed this movie. Good acting, good story, well worth the watch. Not sure how it fits into the over all story of aliens since we also had the movie aliens vs. predator which seems to be missed placed now."
2,Far from great,"First of all, watching this on Amazon Instant is close to impossible. THe whites are totally blown out, the black are completely clogged and have no definition and as this movie takes place in a cave for much of it, you can't even see the art direction, which is presumably one of the redeeming qualities of the film. But really this movie just falls flat."
2,Silly and Boring,"I side with the other reviewers who call this movie a waste of time. It's long and boring. There's not much story. Mankind's first mission to another planetary system is crewed by narcissistic punks. They're all American. In classic Jurassic Park fashion, they go where they shouldn't, do dumb things and get killed. A comic book has better characters. Where is the plot and charm and suspense of the previous Alien films?There are pretty costumes and matte backgrounds from Space Family Robinson. The boss alien resembles the Michelin Man. He collects black oil from the X-Files, gets raped by an octopus, and their kid looks like H.R. Giger's classic conehead. Must be a black sheep in the family.Let's hope humanity's real ambassadors are better than this. Let's hope Hollywood can do better than this."
2,Not Ridley's finest flick,"This not a good movie, story-wise. Too many flaws in character development, and behavior. The characters are silly and make ridiculous decisions, especially since they're supposedly experts in their field.There are some positives... production quality and cinematography are pretty good. Special effects are quite good as well, thanks to Weta.Far too many glaring problems with this movie warrant the low review. I know this won't stop people from watching the movie, but I hope after watching this turd, you will not recommend this movie to others."
2,So-so movie,"Movie tries too hard to be a ""space odyssey"" but fails on story and action, although the actors aren't bad and the robot instead of HAL is good."
2,Even I could see the anachronisms!,Too many details out of sync in this pic. Space travelers using flame throwers as their weapon of choice. Non-professionals chosen for a criticial mission...?Too little attention to detail will throw any sci-fi buff into questioning the consultants on this film. Maybe they took a long lunch?!!
2,What did I just watch?,"Seems like this movie cost about a billion dollars to make, complete with special effects that didn't even need to be included. Sometimes I didn't know what I was watching; other times I caught myself asking ""just why??"" quite a bit. This one is completely forgettable and unless you're an extreme Sci-Fi nut, just leave the house and spend the $ on a couple beers with friends."
2,See for special effects----ONLY,"A wonderful showcase for modern film making and special effects. I find it hard to believe, however, that Ridley Scott allowed his name to be associated with this poorly written travesty of a story. From a life long reader of Sci-Fi."
2,Saw this in theater,"Overall the story line is weak. While it has impressive secens it ends totally on boring. I was VERY disappointed. N I am a person who buys ""stories"" that are dvd which r often a bit slow but good. It starts out pretty good but that is it. It needed ""something""!!!"
3,Science Fiction Movie,"This movie was OK, but not at all as good as it could have been. I love Science Fiction Space Movies, but this one was only so so."
5,Excellent movie,"One of Ridley Scott's best - it puts the entire ""Alien"" sequence in perspective. Picture quality and sound quality are excellent."
5,Prometheus,"Interesting take on the creation of ""Alien"". I like all the twisting of the sub-plots and the visual effects were quite good."
3,interesting movie,"The premise is good, visuals are good. Acting is okay. I guess that's it. I'm not a terrific reviewer and the movie isn't really inspiring me to do much more than this."
3,Missed Potential,"Great special effects, however storyline is very slow starting out. Acting is average, I was hoping for much better. Worth a watch, but that is all."
4,More,"I want the UN-edited directors cut just like the original Alien, and Aliens. Ridley did this film a huge disservice on the cutting room floor."
3,Deja vu,I watched the extended preview and it looked really interesting so I rented the movie for 24hrs and I gotta say it wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. I mean the movie was okay but there were scenes in it that reminded me of Aliens and I didn't like that. Makes the movie seem not very original. I was hoping to see something new but unfortunately it didn't happen with this one.
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"This was kind of like an episode of the X-Files where all week the teasers said this week's episode will answer many questions, only to find after the episode that you understand what's happening even less. So these super aliens started all life across the galaxy? Or they're out to destory it? And the traditional alien creature we know from the other films is born at the end because why? And we all have the same DNA? Sigh."
2,not worth the wait,"I had high hopes for this movie because I am a big science fiction fan.I was very disappointed. It seemed to be an uninteresting mixture of the movies, Contact, and Alien. Both of these movies I enjoyed watching, but Prometheus, I did not enjoy and at the end wished I had my four dollars back. I am still waiting and hoping for someone to come out with a good science fiction movie.I do love to watch them ."
3,Suspend your disbelief... or at least your tolerance for stupidity.,"Reviewing the streaming rental: Very pretty movie. However, the technical details will soon have you screaming at the screen. The ""scientists"" are complete idiots. It might be worth waiting for a director's cut. There are some strange plot jumps that make it hard to keep up in a couple places, despite the fact the plot is mind-numbingly predictable. Possible side effects: echos of Alien may cause mild groaning.Worth a rental, but don't expect to be able to take it very seriously."
4,Ridley Scott Scores Again,"Ridley Scott's prequel to the Alien franchise is not quite as in your face scary as Alien, but it's obvious he wanted to set the stage for the rest of the Alien creepfest. Charlize Theron is stunning (as always) and Noomi Rapace looked great even without all the piercings she sported in ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"". Overall the acting was on pace with the genera and the directing was every bit as good as one would expect from Mr. Scott. The visuals were state of the art. I look forward to watching it again. I give it a solid 4 stars. I liked it enough to buy the Blu-Ray version for my library."
3,very clever syfy suspense,"I really enjoyed how Scott introduced elements of science and faith in this production. Initially, he was having the 2 sides clash, but in the end, science integrates into one's faith very seamlessly. Science and faith are pursuing the goals of explaining ultimate reality, and when approached properly and patiently, will lead to the same goal!"
4,Great 3d movie,This was a Great 3d movie. One of those movie I think I'll only watch 2 or 3 times but hey... the 3D was nice for only 14$!!!
3,"Okay, but could've done more.","Without giving too much away... I was left wanting a bit more, wanting a bit more out of the actors, wanting a bit more plot development, wanting more visually, and while there's the obvious tie-in to the Alien movies, there just wasn't the same suspense and 'creepiness' you got from the first two (and maybe the third... the other Alien movies kind of jumped the shark). I will say, however, by the end, I was left anxious to see what the next installment will entail... and how any proceeding movies will relate to the original Alien."
4,"well made, chronologically speaking.",I was one of the lucky people who didn't know the ending when I first watched it. A well made Sci Fi flick witha great ending.
4,"Visual stunner, interesting beginning","I did not see this film in the theater. But after renting the blu-ray, I have to say I really enjoyed this visual stunner of a film. Maybe this first Aliens prequel installment is more teaser than anything but as a sci-fi buff, I liked the ""old school"" SF feel of this film. Get in a space ship, travel to a mysterious planet and chase a dream and then find out the reality is so much more than you thought. Cast and effects were fantastic. I recently purchased a 3D TV and this movie was one of the first 3D films that I purchased to test my new setup. SImply AMAZING in 3D. Looking forward to the sequel whenever Ridley Scott decides to do it."
4,All right,Had everything you would like but left something undone. Maybe expectations or the first time I watched alien. I think if this was the first one it would have been more of a surprise.
2,What the what?,It was a cool idea but there wasn't enough character develpoment or backstory. It was too disconnected for me. It would have been nice if they had made the movie longer so it could have gotten across the story in a smoother fashion.
5,sci-fi movie,"I haven't seen a sci-fi movie that I really loved. The 3D was fantastic. I love the film, and hope for a sequel, and even more entries in the Alien/Predator universe. All in all, Prometheus is an instant classic. 5 stars, amazing film."
5,I think this met all the hype!,"Having seen Alien quite a few years ago and becoming an instant fan, this film pretty much answered all of my questions about where the ship came from. It tied together where we came from; where the alien ship came from; and where the alien came from.Loved the 3D version. The technology of the future seemed very realistic. It was somewhat predictable, but still very entertaining. I am not going to go into every plot. I just recommend it. The special effects are top rate. The sound is amazing, the special features are really great."
4,Good Movie If You Aren't a Rabid Fanboy,"Most of the negative reviews seem to be from those who have built up the mythos to the point that nothing could make them happy. I loved the original ""Alien"" and the fact that this movie makes an attempt to explain a lot about the first movie is pretty cool. What everyone seems to forget is that the original movie was made with no intention of anything more and I would have been happy if they had stopped there (can you honestly say you don't wish George Lucas would have done the same thing with ""Star Wars?""). As a stand alone movie it's pretty cool. A bit long, but I never found myself getting bored with it. They did a good job of keeping things interesting. If you have seen the other ""Alien"" movies then it will be pleasing in that it kind of explains why there are the aliens, not really what they are, but how they got there, or what their purpose was."
3,not bad,"I thought the movie was ok, but i personally don't like huge cliff hangers that I don't think will be answered. So i dropped my rating two stars because I thought it left to many questions un-answered."
3,Review of Prometheus,"3 D affects were great, good acting,good Si Fi,...but story line to much like Aliens ...unless your an Aliens fan...then you will love this movie."
3,Disappointing,This movie had such potential but such poor execution. I was VERY bummed out by the way they presented the whole story. FAIL.
1,A waste of ones and zeros,"Derivative plot, predictable, stale dialogue, unbelievably stupid characters, etc. Was not expecting Bergman, but hoped for something along the lines of ""Alien."" Alas, fancy CGI ruins yet another film."
1,Really?,Half way through the movie I was cheering for the alien life forms to take out the entire crew. I felt cheated paying $2.99 for this drivel.
3,Alien DNA,"I'm not sure how to rate this one, however it will be interesting to see how they connect the dots in future movies."
5,Suspenseful,"Dark and suspenseful, very good! They did the Alien series proud with this prequel. Great story and action packed movie."
5,Loved this movie!,"Loved this damn movie! If you're a fan of Alien and Aliens, then you'll probably enjoy this also. The Amazon HD rental also has some cool bonus deleted scenes after the credits that personally I thought should have been left in the movie! The HD rental is worth the $4.99 in my opinion. Do it."
2,Terrible production,"This was an attempt to be the beginning for Alien. Not a very good attemt even using the actress from the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It seem to be all about computer grahics and a badly knitted together plot. Hard to connect up the dots with this one. Another ""lets do it for the money"" film. Direction and acting were left out because they would interfere with the supposedly cool graphics. Save your time and money, this was a bust."
3,was expecting more,It was ok. Too many questions unanswered. Seemed like relevance to the Alien saga a bit forced. Wish I only rented it
5,"Great movie, great BluRay set","SO.... A lot of people are writing their reviews based on what they thought about the movie and how they didn't get it. A GOOD MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU THINK AND QUESTION THINGS!!!!!!!!!!! Albeit, there's no way you can get everything that Ridley Scott intended for you to get from one viewing. That said, it's a great movie that's extremely well made.As for the product... It's a fantastic set. Great behind-the-scenes mini-docs! Everything from production information to little, well made, supplements to the plot of the movie like Weyland's TED talk and a ""commercial"" for David. The extended and deleted are excellent! This is an absolute must for anyone who liked the movie and wants to learn more about the Prometheus Universe.If you haven't seen this movie, rent it first. This product is only for people who liked the movie and want to learn more about the lexicon of Prometheus, and will appreciate the effort that went into making this movie"
3,It's o.k.,"Not what I expected, but it does follow the ""tried and true"" path of a science fiction movie. It is a bit long."
4,Very good movie that could have been great,This was a very good and well made movie that seems to have been over edited to cut time. If this was the three hour movie it seems it should have been it would have been a classic.
4,Interesting,"Good storyline bad ending. I really don't have much else to say, they ended the movie in that way so they can have a sequel."
3,Bit Boring,I usually love Riddle Scott movies. Unfortunately I found the plot slow and a bit boring. One watch wonder at best.
3,Not Bad but It's no Aliens,"While I enjoyed the movie I had much higher expectations, possibly because the marketing was so good.This movie lacked the intensity I expected. Although the ending did leave me wanting more."
3,Good movie,"Good movie, I just expected and wasn't surprised at the ending of this one. Which was a little. Disappointing. But this a good movie with fair. Acting"
1,Disappointing at best,"In a word, dumb.Writing at a 13 year old level, incredibly inappropriate casting, marginal premise. I would have expected better from Scott, who did such a great job with the initial Alien.Somewhere around the third sequel, the look and feel changed from believable sci-fi to MTV. This continues the trend with hip-hop dudes and dudettes, replete with tats, attitude and street language, posing as accomplished professionals. Of course we have to have a baddy corporate babe, concerned only with profits - no modern 'sci-fi' is replete without that.Somewhere, Ridley forgot about story and just went for a minimally connected sequence of effects, punctuated by ""Oh-my-gods"" and other shouts of incredulity.Diehard fans (like me) will see it at least once. Not twice, I don't think."
2,Very disappointing,I was really looking forward to this. An intelligent and thought provoking sci-fi ... or so I hoped. The characters are 2 dimensional and the storyline is utter nonsense. Don't waste your time or your money.
4,nice update/prequel to the alien movies,This is worth watching...especially if you liked the 'alien' franchise. Supposed to be a prequel so I'll be curious to see next movies in tne series. Excellent cast.filming.special effects and story line.
4,Great 3D movie,Lots of computer graphics and great 3D experience. Recommend to sci-fi enthusiasts for purchacing. A fantastic 3D movie experience. Will enjoy owning.
4,Good Reboot of Franchise,I'll be interested in seeing where this new storyline to a great franchise goes. The ancestral humans are very intriguing.
3,Looks visually stunning,"I was expecting an ""Alien"" type thriller here but was underwhelmed and even bored at times. I felt like the story lined skipped chunks of time and didn't really explain the motivation behind one of the main characters actions. Visually this movie was stunning in HD when streamed on my PS3. Amazon seems to have taken great care in the streaming technology. Both sound and picture were excellent. Just wish I could say the same about the story line. I give the story 2 stars and added one more for visual effects and sound."
3,Ok,"I am kind of puzzled by this movie. It could have gone in a number of directions. However, it ended up shallow, and without direction. I enjoyed the special effects, but, there should have been more of a story."
3,Prometheus Review,"Very good movie, I liked the visuals and the action but the story line took a long time to build up,"
5,Prometheus,Outstanding movie. I really enjoyed watching the parts which were cut from the movie. They brought a lot of continuity into the movie.I recommend buying this movie without any reservation.
3,Ridley Scott - visual storyteller,"Scott is a great visual storyteller, and Prometheus is yet one more illustration of this. Even Scott's less popular films like 'Legend' demonstrate his uncanny ability to put a world on the screen that is engrossing and believable and delicious to observe. The story of Prometheus is a bit of a head-scratcher, raising as many questions as answers in this prequel to 'Alien', but the film is satisfying, nonetheless, for it's sheer visual impact."
2,so-so movie,it was not as good a movie as what it looked like on the previews. pretty hard to come up with enough words for your requirments
2,Prometheus,A remake of the Alien series with not much drama. Acting was OK if only pedestrian. Special effects were perhaps the best part of the movie.
3,Not Ripley!,"The special effects were wonderful and Fassbender was excellent as David, but the new protagonist is nowhere near ""Ripley"". The Alien franchise is one of my favorite series and I will continue with this prequel, but the magic of Sigourney Weaver as the heroine has no competition from 'Prometheus'"
3,Big Blue Alien creates Humankind- Doom ensues..,I had been dying to see this movie since the first trailers came out.i wasn't disappointed by the movie so much as i was disappointed in the damn plot!From the initial disintegration of the blue alien and its mingling of DNA with-in the roiling water of the nascent earth.I had high hopes! Crap the only good character from then on was the android!I hated the OLD man and his daughter ( her parentage was NOT a surprise by the way)..Though I have to say the visual effects kept me watching to the end. I would like to know if the Android finds the makers and gets his heart.....
3,It was all right,Didn't thrill me like the Alien movies. Had good effects and even liked the lesser known actors. Good rental. Wouldn't buy.
4,Average movie.decent set.,"I went to this movie expecting something along the lines of A2, which is what the promos implied before the movies release. What I got instead was a movie that I felt dragged with little action. I'll leave out the prequel discussion because that could take up another entire day. Adding to my gripes is the hottest chick in the whole movie was barely in it, and while I'll give Ridley the nod on the special effects, this movie could have been a lot better. I would hope the sequel has some action based on the ending of this flick. Time will tell.P.S.I wish some of the deleted scenes actually were used in the movie. The scene at the end where she treats the synth like a sub-human and stuffs his head in a duffel gave her an edge I felt she needed."
3,thumbs up,liked the premise and the actors were good as well. kept me watching the entire time wanting to see the end.
3,could have been better,"The plot was choppy and the cast seemed to ramble at times. Overall, I found it somewhat interesting, especially the ending."
2,Not what I expected the plot and delivery was not adequately engaging,"I found this video less than adequate for entertainment value. It seemed slow and ponderous at points. It definately could use some pumping up to keep me interested. I watched the entire feature, but I would not want to sit through it again. The mystery promised by the cover page and introduction was not delivered from my point of view."
3,a little disapointed could have been better,the trailers and other media gave a different impression of how the story would go and the ending seemed weak at best
3,It was ok,The movie was a big let down that for the most part I was WTF am I watching??? DO your self a favior save your money.
4,Movie,"We had Mixed views in my family, Almost all of us did enjoy it; It had great effects and I will watch it again."
2,"looks good, pointless plot",It's just hard to enjoy a movie in which the characters are forgettable and the story is just a weak setup for them all to die. Meh.
2,PREQUEL TO NOTHING,I am dissapointed with this attempt at a connection to the Alien franchise ... that s all I got ..that's it
2,"Boring, Ridiculous and Stupid.","I love SciFi movies and have probably seen every one made or at least a lot of them. This was one of the worst. I've seen SciFi movies made in the 40s/50s that were better than this one. It was obvious that Scott made this movie to capitalize on the success of Aliens. The movie is not well thought out, has ridiculous action sequences that make little to no sense. The movie was so bad that I now think Scott made it as a spoof of the Alien series. There are plenty of other reviews that detail all that is wrong with this movie.If it made even the remotest sense, I would recommend it to those SciFi buffs that can overlook ridiculous actions by the crew but it doesn't. If you are totally bored, have nothing else to watch, like special effects just for the effects and can overlook anything, then you might consider wasting a couple dollars on this movie."
1,Horrible movie!,This had to have been one of the worst movies of the year! The video quality was great but the movie it self was lacking everything.
1,Watched it once; won't watch it again.,"I've been a Sci Fi fan for a loooong time, and this had to be the biggest bunch of cretins ever packed into a space ship. The actions of the supposedly bright individuals was laughable and stupid. I don't like monster movies, and this was a thinly disguised horror film, not even mediocre Science Fiction. I've liked most of Ridley Scott's films recently, but this one gives me pause to reconsider. I gave it a generous ""one star"" only because there isn't a ""no stars"" option."
2,Not for the squeamish and not as thoughtful as people say,"I was influenced to watch this film by reviewers who called it a ""concept drama"" and who insisted that ""it's not a horror film.""It's a horror film, red (and green and black) in tooth and claw. If you find this kind of thing unpleasant, as I do, avoid the movie.I was led to believe this was a thoughtful meditation on our desire to know our origins and the persistence of faith. Whatever little it has to say on those themes is not worth the mess one must wade through to hear it."
2,Promises?,"The whole movie can be summed up in one phrase, ""What a crock!"" What a waste of digital storage space! Dudley Scott needs to quit trying to deny God. Just one question, where did the aliens come from?"
2,could have been so much better,"this will b quick and painless. the trailer gave us what could have been an amazing movie but of course like many b4, the trailer is the best thing about the film. so many holes, so many characters so unbelievable, so many weak actors (charlene was about as believable as a 'captainl' than capt. crunch) and the story doesnt follow anything worth caring about. was so looking forward to this and disappointed beyond belief. when the bluray is in the 5.00 bin then will get it just to say i have it but cant imagine watching it till i forget how bad it was and then popping in bluray to remind myself of what could have been. missed opportunity, i would say 'yes'"
2,waste of time !!!,"In the comercial the movie look very interesting but actualy the movie don't make any sense it all, the first 20 min was ok!!! but the rest of the movie was a waste of time. this movie is one of those the leve you with a really bad taste of a movie."
1,Horrible movie,If you must see it--rent it. It's not terrible mind you. Just not very good. Don't buy it-you'll thank me later.
5,This film is nothing to do with the Aliens franchise...,"The film prometheus....LEGENDRY.......AMAZING........CLASSICAlot of people I know keep coming up to me and asking me if I've seen the new Aliens movie 'Prometheus' No I reply it's not out yet although the trailer looks great!!! but more importantly it's got NOTHING to do with any of the alien films, it's just ridley scott having another go at the sci-fi genre....and he's done a dam good job!!!"
3,Same old with a couple interesting things,"Same plot as Alien. Nothing new. They also left some holes and unexplained things. Visually it is pretty interesting and it is exciting. Also, had a hard time suspending reality that anyone could endure what they did and still be a better fighter. Especially after having major surgery."
3,Movie,"The movie is interesting, but the 3D did not work properly. It faded in and out every second or so. I would recommend the movie, but not the 3D version."
2,And this makes sense?,"I like Ridley Scott and the original Alien a lot and was prepared to really enjoy this movie. I only rented it before buying because I wanted to make sure of my purchase. Boy was I glad I did. What i was not prepared for was the hacked up editing, the unreality of the captain's actions while parts of the crew were missing, the bizarre plot, and the trite ending. This was a major disappointment.."
3,The usual,"This movie really is nothing but the usual pretty facade and boring/bland pseudo-horror. Everything was rather predictable, and the end anti-climatic."
4,GOOD! !!!!,"I guess like a lot of people we had great expectations about this highly hyped and anticipated movie, I Found it very well made, it answered various hanging quetions from the original movie as usual I enjoy Noomi Rapace's acting, I do recommend this movie if you like the rest of the ALIEN movies! !!!!"
4,This is a good movie for the genre.,"I rarely give 5 stars to a movie. This is a very good movie, for the genre. It is a good popcorn and friends movie."
5,Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever!,"Okay, this is a flawed movie, but I feel it's even better than Alien and Aliens. It's truly sci-fi, perhaps flawed by fan servicing and studio pressures. Critics argue against plot points in this film that they don't mind in John Carpenter's The Thing. Also suffers perhaps, from a more film savvy audience. It's in 3D too! Badass!"
4,A missing piece but not the last?,"Although the entrance of the movie was a little confusing. Although several questions were answered, by the end there were several more created. Such as, if the ""Aliens"" were on the Earth and giving reason to create the ""maps"" why would they point to a planet that was an armory? In the end the movie was outstanding leaving room to answer more questions and probably ask more."
3,It's OK,"I am not a fan of Charlize but if you are, it's more of a cameo appearance. There are very few movies I would pay to see in the theaters. This one really should only be seen if it is free. More recycled storylines with mediocre acting."
5,PROMETHEUS ... A JOURNEY TO FIND OUR MAKERS,PROMETHEUS IS A MUST SEE SCIENCE FICTION EXPERIENCE FULL OF BEAUTY ... DANGER AND QUESTIONS . THE SETS IN THIS MOVIE ARE AMAZING . THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE FLAWLESS . THE SOUND EFFECTS EDITING SHOULD WIN AN OSCAR ! THE MAIN 2 CHARACTERS ELIZABETH SHAW AND DAVID ARE UNFORGETTABLE AS ARE SOME INTENSE SCENES . I WATCH THIS MOVIE TIME AND TIME AGAIN AS I DID WITH THE FIRST 2 ALIEN MOVIES .THIS ONE IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THOSE MOVIES WHILE SHARING SOME OF THEIR DNA ... BUT AWE INSPIRING JUST THE SAME .
1,NO PLOT - BLAH!,This was a poorly written and played horror flick. It absolutely sucked. I rate it below the B movies. I would not suggest this movie to anyone.
1,"An awful, over-blown mess","The story itself is horribly ridiculous, even within its own world of contrivances. I am still stunned that absolutely every aspect of the story is so groaningly, eye-rollingly ridiculous.The acting is good, but marred by the awful story and dialog.The special effects are good, but are also marred by the awful story.I, however, can not say that the direction is good, because a good director would have changed E V E R Y T H I N G. Yes, even Ridley Scott can make stinkers (and this one isn't his first).Basically, without a good story, you have nothing but well-done crap running around in a ridiculous plot saying and doing ridiculous things. And that's exactly what we have here."
3,"""Prometheus"" Pretty Good","The movie ""Prometheus"" is not bad. It borrows a great deal from many other movies, such as the ""Alien"" series, ""Event Horizon,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""2001,"" and many more. But it blends ideas from those other movies together with some creativity, and it does offer a couple of new tweaks. The underlying premise, presented in an interesting and very dramatic way at the very beginning, is somewhat new in this major-movie genre. I thought more could have been done throughout the movie to detail the premise and keep one's thoughts churning on a deeper level. Still, the acting, pacing, and special effects are all done fairly well, so that we fans don't feel cheated. There was a twist at the end that might have been partly for the purpose of setting up a sequel, but it was a somewhat intriguing and thought-provoking twist. ""Prometheus"" wasn't intensely gripping, but I was entertained, and my thoughts were provoked -- a bit."
3,It was okay,The movie had good production value and even decent acting. It introduces a new beginning to the 'Aliens' intellectual property. Give it a watch and decide for yourself.
5,Prometheus,I bought this movie for my husband. We both watched it and it is a very good movie. I am happy with this dvd.
3,Prometheus Unbound?,I had trouble following the story. I will need towatch it several more times I think. I loved the actors.
1,highly disappointing,"Considering that I usually like scifi movies, Ridley Scott and the Alien series, Prometheus is some particular nonsense. Lousy plot, mediocre acting and virtually nothing to do with the original Alien movies, even though they claim to be the prequel. Sorry to say, but in general: highly disappointing."
1,This was the worse movie I ever saw,"After all the hype of the meaning of life etc., this movie was terrible. I do not reccommend it to you."
3,Not too Great,Prometheus was too munch like Alien to really enjoy. Too many of the screens copied those of Alien to be ready enjoyed. I think that hey would have come up with something better.
2,A little disappointing,"The Alien movies have had some ups and downs. Obviously, the original was wonderful...not for the special effects, but for the fear of the unknown. This movie was highly anticipated and left me feeling quite disappointed. It seemed more of a galactic human origins documentary than a sci-fi horror. The alien seemed fake and even disproportionate at many points. However what put me off was the story line itself. It was almost like someone was trying to convey their belief of the origins of mankind through a sci-fi movie. I enjoyed the suspense of the original...that is what made it scary, not some profound ""let's make the audience think"" story. Overall, a letdown for me personally...glad I rented it through Amazon, instead of seeing it in the theater."
1,What a joke this movie is!,"From weak dialogues to non-sense everything, this movie was made for the same crowd that loves watching Jersey Shore, Honey Boo-Boo and worship the Kardashians, that is, the dumb people.When in the world scientists sent to another planet to discover somethign BIG say that they are in the missinon just because of the money and not for the finding? What's the point in having Charlize Tehron in the movie?What about that ""replicant"" role? What was his objective in the movie?Im going to describe this movie in one tiny word: JOKE.I expected more from the director and wished the best for Noomi Rapace,who is the only one acting well, as expected.Dont waste your 5 bucks for this one,people."
4,Great prequel to Alien Films.,Consider this the origin of the Ridley Scott Alien films. Special effects were great as were the actors. A definite watch for sci fi lovers.
3,promise missing,"I truly expected so much more from Sidney ridley, slow moving and some moments that make you go huh??bad trip"
4,Solid SciFi,While it is not unique it is solid well done SciFi which seems to be an endangered genre these days. It did not lean on the Alien series too much as to destroy it's own value but it did provide a tie-in.
3,"Good, not great.","Not much to say about this movie. It was entertaining, but it certainly not to the level of the Alien series. Feels choppy."
3,Not sure whay it was made.,"I wanted to like this movie, I saw it in the theater, and bought a copy, thinking I missed something.I guess what I missed was some continuity left on the cutting room floor.Why the saucer in the beginning and the ""horse-shoe"" ship on-going... different alien factions?Shaw's transition from an archaeologist with a Christian bend to a stapled gut survivor didn't resonate to me... The Ripley transition was much more believable.The sets were interesting, but why the giant head and the canisters in the same room.I have more questions than answers and I don't like applying my reasoning over something I consider incomplete."
3,"Great visuals, Ho Hum plot","The special effects [CG's, etc] make this movie worth watching. The plot is nothing special. The acting is OK. This movie is kinda like Avatar. Awesome visuals, but a worn out plot. I would watch it again for the special effects. Also, the bigger the screen you watch it on makes it better."
3,"Husband LOVES it, I do NOT.","I personally didn't care for this movie. I thought they made the characters so brainless it was unbearable. I thought Noomi Rapace (Elizabeth Shaw) was a horrible addition to the film. I found her utterly annoying and unbearable to watch. I did however love her in Sherlock Holmes and Girl with a Dragon Tattoo. The plot was not the greatest and I am highly disappointed in Riley Scott. I think that we are so starved for a good alien/scifi movie that we think we like it. The footage was awesome and crystal clear, the way a Blu ray should look However, I did give it 3 stars because my husband said it is an awesome movie and demanded I give it 5 stars. I decided to be fair and go in the middle...3 stars. We do not own a 3D TV so we cannot comment on 3D quality but the Blu ray 2D quality is great."
3,"Not a bad movie, Not a great movie","I enjoyed Prometheus as a weekender movie for my wife and I. Some things were way to predictable, and the cast could have been MUCH better. I'd say rent this for a few bucks and toss back some popcorn or whatever you enjoy.Too bad they didn't push the alien thing more...I think they could have done much better with the action/fear aspect."
3,Not bad!,"I liked this movie, it isn't the best I have seen but definitely not the worst. It has fantastic special effects, the story line is pretty good and the acting is pretty on point. Not bad if you're looking for a decent enough SCI-FI film to watch on a night at home."
3,Good enough for a rental,"This movie certainly isnt great nor is it dreadful. It is very much worth the rental price paid to Amazon for viewing it and was at the very least good ""popcorn fodder"". I enjoyed it to a degree and do not at all regret the little bit of money I laid out to rent it."
3,Prometheus,This movie was ok. I love Alien movies and maybe had too high of expectations for this movie. I think it may be the type of movie that needs to be watched multiple times in order to catch everything. The movie was entertaining but was confusing at times.
3,Save your money and rent it,It was just okay. The acting was mediocre and the plot was weak. Only the ending brought it from 2 to 3 stars.
3,It's too much of the old...,I felt like I was watching an updated version of Alien with a splash of background thrown into it. It was ok but not great.
1,A criminal waste of artistic resources.,"Walked out of this flick last month and demanded my money back. Creationism mixed with science fiction is still just creationism, and this movie is chock full of it. Writer Damon Lindelof has stated that he hates doing research when he writes, you can see the result of that technique in this $200,000,000 steaming pile."
1,A horrible film...,"I have seen the movie at the theater during opening day and this review is solely based on the film, not the DVD package.The movie had great acting and stunning visuals but the writing and storytelling is absolute crap. There are so many stupid elements in the story of Prometheus that in my opinion, it's not even worth owning on DVD, unless you're a special effects guru/fan of sci-fi films. The sets and the ship are amazing, but as I've said, what ruins the film is the story; without revealing any spoilers you see dumb scientists doing dumb things, a huge disappointment of a film."
1,"Sorry, Just was too weak for me.....","Ok, not going to rant, but i watch movies like a eat food (very often) I understand its a prespective thing, but this movie lacks in every area. Complete mishap in the Ailiens franchise.... Nothing more to say.. Still pissed i lost my time and ticket money for this junk..."
1,3D problems,"I have a ton of 3D blu-rays, but there is something wrong with this 3D conversion. I am unable to get a clean 3D image no matter what I try .Also, pretty disapointed there isn';t a director's cut with this movie. If any movie needed one, it is this won"
3,The Previews Oversold What Prometheus Could Not Deliver,"I was excited to watch the this morning. I like Ridley Scott's flicks nine times out of ten and hoped this Aliens reboot prequel would deliver. Uh, no. While the pace and character development went well, I have a huge issue with movies that wrap up the ending in five minutes by killing a seemingly formidable antagonist quickly and easily (think: This Means War). Spoiler alert: that's the trap Prometheus fell in to and with it any chance of being remembered as anything but a movie that had SO much potential it never delivered."
1,Blahhhhh,I was really looking forward to this one. I have been an Aliens and Predator fan since the beginning. I'm just gonna pretend this one doesnt exist.
1,too many plagiarized plots,"I think whoever did this movie just used all the Alien movies. I hardly saw anything original and was extremely disappointed.I thought for sure this was going to be the sci fi movie of the year, but not even close. Anyone who has watched the Alien movies will see a much too close resemblance to scenes from those movies. If you watch it, don't expect anything except a let down. It also seems like they set it up for a sequel, which i also expect will be a skip it movie."
1,jaded,"My reaction to the trailer was ""what a pathetic sequence of predictable elements. This is an affront to Ridley Scott.""My reaction to the movie was the same.This may be considered a spoiler but contaminated human male has sex with female. Female gets pregnant with monster baby.Really?There is nothing new here.The acting was well done but the story meant nothing to me and answered nothing and, beyond that, lead up to new questions ... as if there will be a sequel to this prequel. Which does not feel like quality writing but cheap marketing."
4,"Science Fiction Movie not a fantasy, gore movie","First than all this is a good science fiction movie. It has the principal questions than any ""good"" scifi movie has to have: Where are we coming from? What are we? and Why? Packed with an excellent photography (CGI?) and a good action pace.It's not a terror movie but there are some terror scenes. And of course It is not an Alien movie which is good because It's hard to imagine another plot with Aliens all over the place. Nevertheless there is a conection and some clarification to the first Alien which is thanked (or should it be).It isn't perfect but is good enough as to make you want more!!The best character, no doubt about it: the android.Probably some edition would have been good but all in all a good movie."
3,Just Okay,I was expecting a much better movie. Plot was weak and felt disconnected. Characters could have been developed further. Rent before you buy.
2,Disappointing,I had high hopes for this movie but I ended up very disappointing. I only found one character interesting was the ship's captain.Visually the movie is beautiful. The characters are flat and uninteresting. And the plot was disappointing
1,Why did I waste the money?,"I guess I am not one of the ""smart"" people. Who wrote this mess of a movie? It was like watching Scooby Doo meets the Jetsons. What was the plot? What was the POINT? I thought this was an Alien the movie prequel? Others have pointed out all of the very obvious incredibly stupid scenes in this, ahem, ""movie""... I spent most of the movie going ""huh"", trying to figure out why I was sitting there wasting my time watching this when I could be changing the oil in my pick up... And I hate changing the oil in my truck..."
2,Boring,"Boring. I have no idea what this movie was about it didn't make any sense. Rent it from the library if you want it and don't waste your money until you know you like it.I thought this was going to be like the old alien movies but it was too ""high tech"" and didn't have the feeling of the older movies and didn't have anything to do with them."
4,Great movie,This a visually exciting movie with a deep story and is a great continuation into the Alien storyline. The soundtrack is great too.
3,"Good, not Great","I actually liked Prometheus as a whole. it wasnt the best sci-fi movie ive seen this year, but it was decent, and worth the price i paid for it. ill tell you this much.. Noomi Rapace stole the show. if it wasnt for her performance, i probably would have rated this film much lower. but, she did a great job. the rest of the cast, even charlize theron which normally does a fantastic job, were kind of lackluster.also, the film lacked that intensity factor. there was only really a couple of scenes in the whole film which put me at the edge of my seat. the rest was kind of meh.so yeah, it was a decent film.. one that i will probably watch again.. but i definitely see why the movie got mixed reviews. its just from my perspective, it wasnt that bad. but admittedly, Noomi Rapace is the primary reason for me liking the film. without her performance, i too would have rated this film 2 stars.. maybe lower."
2,PROMETHEUS,"This movie is a good visual sci-fi movie with good acting by some really good actors . It ends there. It was intended as a prequel to the Alien Franchise and failed horribly. I had hopes for this movie being under the original director, but it failed. James Cameron set the ALIEN franchise out of everyone else's reach apparently, since every Alien film since has utterly failed. Mainly because the fans want more of what James Cameron gave us in ALIENS. Hollywood can't seem to grasp that notion. I do not recommend paying over 5 bucks for this movie."
2,"Aliens 12, or something like that","I was quite disappointed in the movie. It's visually stunning, pretty well acted, but it's just Aliens redux. The dark gut of an alien ship, the pods, the goo. The alien man creature himself was fairly impressive, but this was made laughable at the end of the movie when the camera went back to this aliens dead body and out popped................the alien creature from Alien, Alien 1, Alien 2, Alien 3, on and on. I actually laughed out loud when I saw this. If you're looking for something new, this isn't it, unfortunately. I was waiting to get my socks knocked off by this, but the best parts of the movie are in the trailer."
2,Disappointing and nothing new on the table.,"This isn't my kind of movie so I went in knowing that but about an hr in I became aware that my sci-fi loving hubby was fidgeting and then sighing heavily. And it wasn't just him -- the entire theater seemed bored or as one other movie goer said as we exited ""that was a waste of popcorn."" You could take out the Charlize Theron character and it wouldn't alter the story much at all, a complete waste of an Oscar winning actress. This being said, Noomi Rapace really excels in her role at Dr. Shaw. One tough cookie, she is."
2,Prometheus,"If you like another ""Alien"" movie you might like this. Follows similar story line Lot of action good visual effects"
1,Not a great SciFi film. Rent do not buy,"When you can predict every turn and plot of a movie it tends to be a bit boring. CGI does not make a good movie. Also, just because it is a precursor to great films does not make it great either. If that was the case prequels to Star Wars were great films, and they were not. This movie was boring. I felt like I was watching it just to watch it. It did not grab my attention at all. Did it have a cool flying ship and futuristic guns and gadgets, yes, but so what. I almost laughed when the lady said my company spent 1 trillion dollars to go on this mission. This was meant to pop your eyes. Wow! 1 trillion dollars! That's just crazy money no wonder they have a huge spaceship. Give me a break.To all those reviewers who think this is going to be a classic down the road, LOL! The reason SciFi movies are classics is because the broke the mold and thought outside the box. This is just remade for the next generation.Not a great movie but a time waster."
1,"Ridley, you got some splainin' to do!","I went into the theater with zero expectations, and came out with poo on my shoe. I scraped it off, but the stench was imprinted on my brain. Luckily, in the aftermath of seeing Lethal Weapon 3 and 4, Alien 3 and 4, Matrix 2 and 3, and Star Wars ep. 1,2, and 3, I've trained myself well on how to do a ""mind wipe"". Now I'm getting more anxious about Jackson and his 2, strike that, 3 Hobbit movies... p.s., plenty of other reviewers have covered in depth all the reasons why this movie reeks, so I chose the more visceral route."
3,Much more = much less,"A visual masterpiece but didnt come close to the greatness of original or 2nd Alien movies. The acting was OK but the story was lacking, boring at times."
4,A Beautiful Mess!,Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy). Wondrous Visuals..Uneven plot..The movie inspires debate...I'll make this short and sweet...This set is loaded with content great stuff...The picture quality on both 3-d and 2-d blu-rays are absolutely astounding possibly the best I've seen..The sound is window rattling goodness to say the least..if you have the proper system WOW! If your fan..I'd say its a must buy..just be prepared for some let down with the silly plot.
4,Prometheus.......worth a look,"I have always been a fan of Ridley Scott. The first ""Alien"" movie really scared me and I always wondered if we would ever find out any details about the aliens. Now we have and I really hope there is a sequel in the works for ""Prometheus"" because there are now questions that demand answers!"
3,Plot and special effects were OK.,The ship was really cool. The plot and special effects should have been better.Skip this one and look for another.
4,Movie,This movie was not what I thought it was about. I did not care too much for this movie.I will not recommend this movie.
3,Only skin deep,"This film is a visual beauty, it really is, but that beauty is only skin deep when it comes to the story. The plot has too many holes and gaps for the viewer to fill in. There's no clear motivation for the actions of the characters, stretching the story way beyond any credible suspension of disbelief.The film glosses over the philosophical questions it started off trying to answer, coming off as more of an existential mess.I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, he's truly brilliant, so maybe my expectations for this film were too high. Some of the Alien franchise movies are true classics, but that sadly won't be the case with this film.Something went terrible wrong with the story. I'm sure I'll see this film again, it really is a visual joy, but sadly not as good of a story is it could have, and should have been."
4,Good Show,"It's not what I was expecting but it's a good movie. There are a few areas that could have been expanded on but all in all, it's good!"
3,It 's ok,"Ok sci fi movie. The story could have been deeper. Many unanswered threads, but I was able to watch to the end ."
4,Wasn't a complete waste of time,"The movie was visually enjoyable the acting wasn't horrible the story was pretty weak. It's certainly not going to be discussed years from now as a great movie of the past, but I wasn't bored and didn't feel like I had wasted two hours of my life so I guess overal I enjoyed it"
2,VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.,"I was expecting top stuff from Scott Riley but instead I got this, I was horrible from start to finish, holes in the story line everywhere and it never made sense."
5,Can't wait to see Paradise...,"I've watched ALL Aliens movies from the very beginning and this one didn't disappoint. The story base told the story of the origins, but keeps you wanting more."
5,"Intrigue throughout the movie, mind-blown at end..","The entire film keeps you on your feet by offering a uniquely presented perspective on alternate creation theories.The end of the movie seemed to go smoothly with the rest of the film.. Full of intrigue, however.. The last few minutes will give you one of those ""Wait! No way!! Aha!!"" Sort of moments.This is most certainly a clever movie throughout and the end to cap it off the way it did, earns without question, 5 stars. I'll be happy to watch this movie again soon!"
5,Great Movie,"Not as epic as we thought, but definitely worth watching. Great CG, good suspense, good acting, and cool action. I wish there was more a little more action."
4,SPOILER ALERT! Like an Alien prequel,"Saw this movie in theaters and liked it quite a bit. I'm still unsure if this was supposed to be officially in the Alien movie line or if the references were just ""easter eggs."" I also think there were some ties to Stargate SG-1, besides just the title.The environments were great and definitely worth seeing in HD. The plot was good, with a nice departure from every single Alien movie plot. Instead of aliens spreading like zombies to kill everyone, they were already there and it goes a lot deeper into the story and less on just survival.A huge plus, the girl is cuter than Ripley from the Alien series. ;)"
3,Not What I was Expecting,I was expecting a lot more. Not bad and definitely worth watching but not what I was hoping it would be. I guess I'm sick of movies trying to be so deep. I'd just like to be entertained sometimes. Can we just have a Serenity 2?
4,Great surprise to find i got this instant video rental with my purchase of the physical movie,"I never really enjoyed the alien and predator movies but this movie really made me appreciate the whole series. I wish i could know more behind what they found in the movie, but i understand that this is a prequel to the alien movies and explains how they came to be, not about where those ""engineers"" came from and everything else about them.The storyline rolled quickly and smoothly and kept you sucked in. Was never a dull moment"
4,Better the Second Time,"Like many folks I went to see Prometheus expecting an Alien prequel. I didn't read any pre-movie reviews because I didn't weant to see any spoilers. After seeing it I was left scratching my head. No, it really isn't an Alien prequel. Many other reviewers here have disected the film in great detail. I won't repeat what they've already written.I will say that I enjoyed the movie more the second time I saw it. The Blu-ray has features that give a better explanation of what the film and Ridley Scott were trying to accomplish. It isn't bad Sci-Fi (like lots of Sci-Fi) it's just different. The Blu-ray wasn't crammed with superfluous extras, but enough to give you some additional flavor. I say it's worth a look."
4,Though provocative,A new take on the origin of man. Some parts were laughable but it was enjoyable not terribly scary like the Alien series.Noomi does the best acting in this film. Lots of xtras.
3,Just ok,Had way less special effects than I expected the trailer gave away a lot of the cool parts. It said 1.99 but I was charged 3.99 and got a MP3 credit.
2,Great Promise-Poor Delivery,"I was very excited to see this movie, partly based on the obvious links to it being an ""Alien"" prequel, but what Ridley Scott and his four screenwriters delivered was a bloody, gory, pathetic mess that leaves all of the evocative questions it asked unanswered. All the Creator says is ""Why did you come here?"" and then it kills everyone for no particular reason? Are we to understand that our ""gods"" are vicious thugs who revile us for no reason? Did they create the Alien creatures to wipe us out? Why did they fail? What went wrong? None of those questions are answered. I wanted to like this movie. I liked some of the 3D effects, but not much else. A movie with a lot of promise that only delivered a high body count and predictable ending. Very disappointing. I hope Scott's ""Blade Runner"" sequel is better than this confusing bloody mess."
2,What a grotesque mess of a movie!,"Confusing plot, mostly uninteresting characters, retreads of baubles from Alien, themes just pasted on with no support. The only reason I would give it 2 stars is the special effects. Oh, and did I mention gratuitously gross? Maybe the original Alien movie was a fluke. Do yourself a favor and watch it instead."
3,"Plot should've been more developed it had a whole lot more to prove, it wasn't as good as promised.",i like this movie but i was expecting more from it. It doesn't seem to matched up to the hipe it had.
4,Prometheus review,"We thought this movie might be prequel to the ""Alien"" series and we were pleased by the movie overall; just a few things were a bit too different for our ""Alien enthusiast personalities"" which is why it didn't get a 5, but it was an exciting and well done movie. It's a keeper. The seller sent it in a very timely manner and I would certainly purchase from them again, too!"
4,Interesting but could be better,"The movie frustrates with characters that are not real, seeming our of place on a scientific expedition. I watched the movie 2x, getting more out of it."
5,Great!,The same as i said above great product that everyone should buy. Blue ray is the best quality so you can enjoy the movie better.
3,What?,I was doing fine till I found out it was tied in with Alien. If they can put together a good follow up that might change my tune.
2,What were they trying to accomplish with Prometheus ?,"The lead character of this movie ( Noomi Rapace) made the best with a poor script that went nowhere. The main plot has been done hundreds of times in films like : The X-Files, 2001:Space Odyssey, Star Trek and The Twilight Zone Series.The special effects are great and without a doubt pleasant to the eye but the script lack of cohesiveness leaves the viewer unimpressed and urging for more.If you are a science-fiction fan, you won't be disappointed; although, some forethought would not hurt to say the least.In summary, a lot of good actors made this movie pleasant to watch; but, it will keep you from coming back for more."
2,"Visually striking,intellectually disappointing.","Stunning cinematography, terrible story. I was so looking forward to this movie but like most movies today, it was visually striking, but the story had no depth. So much of what happened in this movie didn't make sense from a story viewpoint and from a technical, intellectual viewpoint. A great Sci-Fi is not only visually mesmerizing, but also engaging in it's story."
1,Disappointing,"Just because it might be symbolic doesn't mean it's not a stupid, nonsensical mess. Nice to look at though. Overall, completely unsatisfying."
2,Not worth the rental,"This is one of the few times I should have followed the reviews. I found the movie to be boring, and disappointing."
3,soso,Was pretty excited about this movie as I have been a big fan of the Alien series. this was ok but not nearly as good as the previous movies. The cast was ok not great.
2,lack of continuity,i hate plot holes and this movie has some whoppers.enjoy it for what it is. if you never saw aliens then this is a good movie.as a prequil it blows
2,"Not the ""blockbuster"" it was alluded to be","My wife and I went to the movie theater to see this movie in 3D when it first came out. Unfortunately, the theater lost power and after 45 minutes of waiting, we were told we'd get to see any other movie we wanted for free. As time played it, we didn't get to see Prometheus until we rented it on Amazon.The movie isn't all that. It's more of a combination of Alien, Aliens, and Predator II, with a very tiny bit of Armageddon (mainly limited to the ""sophisticated"" equipment portrayed in the movie), and it really doesn't have much of a plot. It's ok for a one time rental, whether in HD or SD, but given that it didn't stay in the movie theaters long enough, such should be a clue."
3,The story of mankind...,The movie was good to me. I felt like it had a few parts that did not need to be in the movie. Overall I was pleased with the movie.
2,It's Not Aliens,I watched it once and would not watch it again or recommend it to others. I am glad I did not go to the theatre to see the movie.
2,Technical Difficulties,"Unfortunately, I was unable to watch this movie through Amazon as it kept getting 'hung up'. Seems whenever I've tried to watch a movie or TV series through Amazon, there are technical difficulties; this doesn't happen when I use Netflix or other services. I ended up seeing it via my cable channel and it was so-so."
2,Mediocre,"This is an opportunistic film, based on a weak script, bad casting and mediocre directing. The director counts on (extraordinary) visual effects to bail him out almost as if blinding the viewer by cool tricks would mask the many internal inconsistencies within the plot. I was unable to relate to any of the actors, which was intensely dissatisfying - the movie lacked, for the lack of a better word, humaneness. The characters were unidimensional, without an inner life as well as unconvincing (especially the scientists). When the best act is provided by the robot well then the director has a problem. I count this one as a ""miss""."
2,3d dizziness,Although this is a great movie..... The 3d was not well done. I have over 25 3d blu rays and so far only two make me dizzy and just does not look right! This one and the darkest hour. They need to get whoever did the 3d on marvel movies to do it on this movie. Should have just bought the 2d blu ray instead...
2,solid 2.5 nothing more.,"this movie, decent build up, interesting, keeps you going. looks like it is going somewhere. in the end you feel cheated. all of that for this? to get here?you can safely miss this movie and makes no difference. i know going back and watching shows you've seen before can be pretty lame. but if you had the choice to watch alien again versus watching this show, alien would be more enjoyable. which is to say, probably neither of them would be enjoyable. after all who wants to see alien all over again?neither is as good as aliens either :)"
3,my review,Good but not what I expected... needed more action! Left a lot to be desired... special effects was great... I look forward to the follow-up... the DNA of the human race!
3,good movie but wheres the 3d,don't buy this if your expecting decent or better 3d. i only paid same price as blu ray but still disappointing .
4,Whole new plot...,Setup the setting for a whole new series based on Aliens. Interesting plot. Will be interesting to see where this goes....
3,Could have been so much more,"Sorry, but it just wasn't that good. Worth a rental, not to buy. I love the ""Alien"" series, and to see them show it's supposed origins in this movie was one of the reasons I thought it could be good. I was let down. Good science fiction movie though."
5,Nice 3D,"This is a nicely made 3D movie with none of the ""jump out at the audience"" gimmicks. I have seen the movie in regular blu ray in the past, and can honestly say the 3D just made it more enjoyable. The 3D in this movie enhance the depth of things I overlooked in the 2D version but it does not overwhelm the viewer with unnecessary fluff."
4,It was better then I have heard,I thought some parts needed to be more explained. I felt the story was a bit more less bland and the actors where okay at best. Would like to see another and more of a story behind all this.
3,Okay,"The movie was just okay, not horrible, not great. I wouldn'trecommend it to any of my friends to watch. The quality of theAmazon VOD was good, it was just the movie that wasn't thatgreat."
3,Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy),"I still find certain aspects of this movie a bit confusing and in conflic with the original ""Alien"" so I'm hoping that Ridley Scott can either tie everything together in a sequel or at least re-release this picture in an extended form that covers more of the questions it left unanswered. It would definitely have benefitted from a much better screenplay writer and one that at least was old enough to have actually seen the original and absorbed and understood the plot."
4,Enjoy the Surreal values of Prometheus,"I am not a true Aliens fan but I did enjoy this prequil. The film has a more European feel with artsy elements. The performances are middle of road but not as essential to the story line which dominates. For those of strong stomach, Prometheus is entertaining and often darkly humorous."
3,So so,"Special Effects are awesome and 3D was top notch, story's a bit wack. Could have been a whole lot better."
3,Just okay,Trailer was great and the movie was just okay. Better writing but nodays not too many scifi movies that come out
2,PROMETHEUS,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING IT, I BOUGHT IT AND I HAVE WATCHED IT TWICE. BUT IT IS JUST-OK TO RENT ONLY..."
4,"a prequel that ties the original alien series together, with a twist","Excellent cast, especially Noomi Rapace, with Charlize Theron a convincing bad guy. Best android yet. Great suspense as our creators are slowly revealed, then knocked off their pedestal, with room left for a Prometheus II."
4,Delivers on Action and Visual Effects; Story is Weak,"The aesthetics and visual effects of this movie were awesome to behold - and we would expect nothing less of Ridley Scott. Truly stunning to watch. As a prequel, this movie lacks the character development and general plot quality that would put it in the company of the other films in the 'Alien' series. Not all that I expected it to be, but entertaining and fun."
2,Disappointed,It was slow and boringWhile I like the actors and actresses in the movie and the work they didIt was a lousy vehicle
4,Good,Good movie very different than I thought it would be. Great story line. I would recommend it. Ould watch again and again.
4,GREAT SCIENCE FICTION FILM,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband. We watched it Christmas Day and were thoroughly engrossed. A little ""star wars-like"", but a lot deeper(intellectually). Left room for Prometheus 2. An exploratory excursion into the universe to find the origin of their species. My husband and I believe there is a much better way to accomplish that, but a very interesting science fiction movie, if you remember it is fiction."
3,This movie was not what I expected.,"I rented this movie with expectation of a great, mind expanding sci-fi thriller and ended up watching Alien again. If that's what your looking for then buy it! Otherwise, don't waste your time."
3,Strange...but watchable,"I was left with more questions than answers after watching this in the theater. That said, it was engaging enough, and I'm a fan of Alien and Aliens, so it was worth the Black Friday sale price!"
3,"Great special effects,not to much thought put into the the plot.","""Aliens"" fans probably will like this picture. People have different tastes in movies i was very disappointed with the ending.A+ on special effects. Charlize Theron is always hot!"
1,The dumbest movie I have seen in years,"Maybe this movie is acceptable with a younger audience.....?. (My age 49.)Seriously, I could go on a very long rant about how dumb this movie is. I put this on my watch list because it had many positive reviews. I rarely get my husband to sit down and watch a movie with me. We both were amazed at the pure stupidity of the plot or lack there of. Trust me just don't waste your time! The only reason we finished it is because we were riding our trainers and it would have been difficult to put on a new movie. The trailer did make it look interesting, however I cannot actually find words to express how silly and lame this movie is!! Beware."
2,Disappointments Galore,This is possibly the most disappointing flick in science fiction / horror since Godzilla. There is no connection forged with any of the characters. If you feel anything for them at all it would have to be annoyance.I'm sorry to say this film was an exercise in hubris for Scott. Hopefully his investors will have someone watching over his shoulder next time.
5,was great,nice loved it story line was great but kind of fast but no matter did the job for me for a syfi.
4,Not a bad movie,"It's a great scifi and fun to watch good effects but I found it a little confusing. Not a whole lot of action, and some characters were annoying, but overall a good movie."
5,one possible beginning for a classic,"To be honest, not as terrifying as the first Alien, but more interesting, It takes lot of it's elements, some of them quite visible and others subtle, one may miss the classic spiky longheaded drooling two mouthed monster... but as the Alien mithology goes, this add lots of new things, arcane ingeneers included, resulting in one of the most immaginative and possibilities opening way to present again this dark and monstrous universe... Is difficult just to begin to grasp all the new fantasies and imagination paths now laid in front of us. As it is, because this new movie, the cuadralogy we all know and love, and the two addings with predator, are just a couple of many possible outcomes, ramifications and plausible histories. I really hope this is just the first of many!!!Totally enjoyable, and the extras... mind blowing!!!"
3,Somewhat Disappointed!,Some great effects and sets but overall I felt the story line wasn't very strong! Very similar in plot to the original Alien and not nearly as well acted or frightening! It does give some answers to true Alien fans. I would give it 2 1/2 stars.
2,Who would have imagined that Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe ...,"... would turn out to be such a dog? The problems hit early and often: a bewildering set-up sequence, an insipid romantic relationship, moments that are just off-the-charts ridiculous, confusing shot-setups, plausibility issues up the yin-yang in the later going, an over-investment in blind aggression in the characters, monsters that do not scare (though there are a couple of nice effects), characters that we do not care about, useless tips of the hat to Alien and a cheesy overall feel that suggests Scott finds ""legacy"" a foreign concept."
2,*sigh*,Well i didnt know what to expect. I watched it just turned more disappointing the more the movie went on.
1,Don't Judge a Book By It's Cover,"The action was minimal. The story line dragged, and dragged, and dragged on. The 3D effects were so-so at best.So if I can rate it a half a star just because I would."
2,Prometheus 3D,"Not the type of movie I prefer to watch, to much gore, fair 3D effects. I would rather watch movies with little violence.Loved ET and Star War's movies."
1,Ho hum ZZZZZZZZZZ,"Sleeping would be a much better use of time than watching this movie.Good special effects, spotty acting and over-acting, really weak story development, character development non-existent.Other than that there is nothing to recommend this movie."
2,too much blood and horror,"Anyone that loves blood and horror will love this movie, it was a little too much for me. But it was a take off of Aliens. thanks"
2,This movie is silly.,The special effects are great but the story is really dumb. Who would be smart enough to build an interstellar space ship and then hire a crew of dorks to go on the mission? What kind of alien would be advanced enough to create humans and when we make contact with them just give a grunt and rip off someones head? Don't waste your time with on this one.
5,Great SciFi Movie as Expected,"Finally, a SciFi movie that lives up to it's hype. Great story and a terrific pre-cursor to Aliens. This BluRay has awesome sound and video. It ranks as my second best demo disc. Sound is very realistic and enveloping. Crystal clear and very detailed , I must add. The ending definitely leads into a second and probably a third movie. Can't wait for the next one."
3,Prometheus got me thinking but miss the scares of Alien,"I really enjoyed the film -- the special effects were beautiful and truly epic and artful. Though overall the film seemed to miss the mark, for me anyway. It was definitley a thought provoking film about creation but the rest of the story brought nothing new to the genre or franchise. The thing I enjoyed about the first film in the series was the claustiphobic feel and the lonliness of space - I was hoping that would be reflected in this film as well. The acting in this did not feel fresh to me and unfortunatly being a big fan of the first, I enjoyed the improvisation of the acting and how it didn't feel scripted at all - which brought realism and humanity to the first Alien film. And truth be told I was looking for a few more scares but that is just me. I would recommend the film a good watch but not the classic chills like ""Alien"" or the classic thrills ""Aliens"" gave us."
4,Indeed a good movie,"I know that many people did not enjoy this movie because of major plot holes and whatnot. But I feel it leaves an openness in the movie for each individual to think a little deeper about the meaning. If you're looking for something to shut your brain off to, you'll miss a lot, and have a bad time. The visuals are insanely stunning, and the work of Michael Fassbender is phenomenal. The music really sets the tone of the movie. Give it a shot, turn on your brain, and enjoy."
1,not a full screen,"there was not a full screen ,making the 3d verry weak. i would not reconmend this movie to any one"
1,DIGITAL COPY DOES NOT WORK,"Do not purchase this movie if you wish to use the digital copy that Fox has so kindly included.... because it doesn't work. Google ""the code you entered is not valid for your region"" and you'll see that thousands of people are having issue with Fox and their digital copy issues. The codes that they provide for their digital copy DVD's just do not work in ANY region. This is why people hate DRM and why pirating movies has become so popular- I paid $25 for this movie yet can't even have it on my computer/table/phone."
2,Prometheus,"bad acting, poor script.not worth the money.not worth the money.not worth the money.not worth the money"
2,Nope.,"I didn't make it past the first 30 minutes, it felt like I knew the story too well, as if I had seen it before, many times."
1,Alien Five?,"I can't recall when I last saw a movie so derivative, so imitative, so unoriginal.Sure, it has its moments, but I found it to be a major disappointment. Its makers took a potentially compelling, thought provoking plot and reduced it to an ""Alien"" sequel.Granted, it really does deserve more than a single star -- just for the storm sequence alone -- but considering what I perceive to be the laziness involved (shamelessly recycling the previously done), one lousy star is what I'll give it."
1,Another Stupid Prequel,This prequel did not live up to its expectations. Visually it was interesting but there really weren't any new ideas here.
1,Terrible,This may honestly be the worst movie I have ever seen. I love these type movies and was pumped to watch this. But it was ridiculous the actors were completely un-likable and the story was dumb tying way to hard to bring God creation etc.. into this movie. Terrible
1,Boring,I found this movie to be boring and predictable!!! I knew what was going to happen before it happened. Absolutely no surprises. I've seen better plots in B movies.
1,Prometheus leaves a lot to be desired.,"Promethus is rated for less than one star due to the fact that the entire plot became your typical ""run-of-the-mill"" sci-fi movie plot. Prometheus just had more financial backing to produce such a film and sadly left a lot to be desired to retain a uniqueness separate from most sci-fi films.If such a viewer does not mind watching a predictable and generic plot unfold, then good luck."
3,"Good idea, poorly implemented.","Prometheus is the reason I gave up watching movies.Short and sweet - the visuals are fantastic, the story line seems original, the editing is ridiculous bad, and the acting is better suited for a B movie. If there is nothing better on TV or you are a movie honk, this may be a good rental at the going rate; otherwise, wait for RedBox to run it for a buck to ease the disappointment."
4,Alien prequel stands on its own,"In Prometheus, director Ridley Scott revisits his first major triumph. In 1979, Alien almost set a new standard for gothic sci-fi melodrama. With the sequel already done, Scott came up with the idea of a prequel. The premise is that the long-dead non-human pilot seen early in Alien is a member of a race that shared a much earlier connection to humanity. Both the script and the direction meticulously tie the two films together, re-creating the starkness and desolation of the distant planet. There are also quite a few references to the plot of Alien, notably the strong female lead. But surprisingly, Prometheus actually stands better on its own. At times mysterious, a bit incoherent in places but often visually impressive, Prometheus works best as an independent drama. The conclusion is suitably ambiguous, leaving open the possibility of yet another film in the series."
1,Promethesus,"The movie was poorly done, and the plot was dismal.It is typical of a British movie.Would you like to buy it back...still unopened?"
5,Prometheus Kickass,"Loved it. Wish part 2 would come soon! This movie was so awesome, would have bought it, but I would only have watched it the once."
5,Great Movie,"I really like the story of Prometheus and the quality of the acting. I really like it because they use new and basically unknown talent, I get so tired of the same actors over and over again that I found this movie really refreshing. I can't wait for Prometheus 2."
4,Loved it.,"For a prequal to Alien, I'll will be very upset if they don't complete and do a part 2 and 3 of this movie. It was awesome."
4,For the Alien franchise fans out there,This movie fills in alot of the blanks with the entire Alien story. Very good and enjoyable. Finally understand a little better what was going on. Although it does raise more questions than it answered. Good nonetheless.
4,At least it looks good.,"I've heard nothing but horrible things when other people give their thoughts on Prometheus. I'm easily entertained and try to notice the positive things about a film, however, and I think it's a great summer sci-fi flick. The best sci-fi film in the past few years..."
5,Special Effects Masterpiece!,I enjoyed the movie! All I cansay is that it was great ! I hope there will be a sequel!
2,"Dear Prometheus,","Don't invoke ""Lawrence of Arabia."" You don't profit by the comparison, and it reminds us we could be watching a much better film.Also, a Christian anthropologist, a robot, and a big albino do not weighty philosophical speculation make. 'Knowing our Creator' is just a veneer of blather on the carcass of a none too scary monster movie.""2001"" is an intelligent sci-fi film; sadly, Ridley Scott is no Stanley Kubrick.In fact, if you see Ridley, tell him it feels like a long time since The Duellists (****).Reproachfully,A Paying Customer and Aliens Fan"
2,Fractal Stupidity,"""Prometheus"" is one of a new wave of pseudo-SF films that achieve what I call 'fractal stupidity.' It's actually impossible to list all the logic flaws, because between any two given flaws, it is always possible to find a third. Just as a Mandelbrot curve is convoluted in an infinite way, the film is illogical in an infinitely fine-grained way.In other words, no matter how thin you slice it, it's still baloney."
1,Stunning 3D for a 1D story,"3D! As Dave craddled the earth in his right hand during one of most awing inspiring scenes in recent date for a movie, Ridley Scott crushed the life out of this movie in his left hand with a misguided effort trying to tie two movies together that didn't need to be. This movie truly needed to be a stand alone story. Had it been it wouldnt have been crushed under the weight of expectation.This was worse than Alien Resurrection due solely to the pedigree that presented this newest work. While the movie looks astonishing it managed to offer no coherent storyline and lacked any true character. The actors were stellar, they we all very convincing in their roles. That said this film is an utter disaster in directing, writing and editing. However I am still going to buy it just for the 3D."
2,What in the World?,"Can somebody please tell me just what in the World this crap was about? Way too complicatedfor its own good. Utterly devoid of any of the suspense of the original Alien. As far as I cansee NO questions were answered about who the ""Engineers"" were. Why they created US. Why they thendecided to destroy us. Why that Engineer at the beginning was committing suicide? What the hellthat squid-like thing was supposed to be inside Noomi? Why David put that Alien substance into thescientists drink? A confusing and highly disappointing mess in my opinion. Thank God I didnt seethis at the cinema. Boy I would have been pissed."
2,Disappointing,"I expected much more when I saw this in IMAX 3D. The plot was disjointed and was hard to follow. From the opening to the end, the story felt like someone was just trying to make a movie but forgot the purpose. Some scenes were ""entertaining"", but I was not expecting to be so let down in the end. Some good cast members, but this movie has only one point, which is to separate you from your money and you get very little for it. Don't waste your money, I am sure it will show up on HBO or Showtime quickly."
2,I had to research the web to understand what happened...,I was disappointed at what a terrible job the film did at unfolding a story. I had so many questions about what was going on there was no satisfaction in watching the movie. I had to go to the internet for answers or what could be answers as it appears many people felt left in the dark. The characters' behavior was so off the wall it was not believable. Prometheus had potential for greatness but missed the mark by a couple of light-years.
2,Trite attempt at a prequel.,"Have you ever seen anyone look at a cobra and think, I'm just gonna cuddle with it? Have you ever seen a deep sea diver decide, I'm going to take off the suit that ensures my head isn't crushed like an egg by the intense water pressure at the ocean floor?Though quite pretty at times, this movie was riddles with terrible writing and poor decisions. You know when someone in a horror movie says, ""let's split up"" that someone is going to die. This sort of writing is generally unacceptable, unless you're watching something like Scream 18 or Bride of Chucky. Those are movies where that level of lazy writing can be accepted under the fun of camp and too much blood. Some like it, some don't.This movie makes all those decisions without any of the camp. It might be better termed, ""What happens when we let children who have been dropped on their head go into space.""I don't just want my money back. I want Riddley Scott to hand it to me himself with an apology for what he has done."
2,"my review,may not be yours","Not real good, just a video should just be on free TV over the air. not very creative not very suspensefulIt"
2,Disappointing and subpar,"The only thing i enjoyed about the movie was the set production and special effects, visually it was appealing. Considering Mr Scott's rep, this was well beneath his previous work. The story is weak, the characters are unrealisticly idiotic, and the choice to make this a prequel was absurd since its ability for special effects was far superior to the other movies and so therefore makes the technology in the others appear primitive. Recommend waiting for free streaming on Netflix if your morbid curiosity cannot be quelled."
2,"Dumb and gory, not worth my time.","My title says it all...don't bother. The story is lame, and some of the scenes are so graphic you have to turn away. UGH!"
1,"Save yourself 2 hours and see something, anything else",I had high hopes but this movie was just cheese. If you can overlook the hard to swallow plot and illogical actions of the crew it felt like a bad bad remix of the alien movies.
1,Boring,"The whole concept that humans were ""created"" by an alien race and scientists go in search of them is just ridiculous. We saw stuff like this in ""Chariots of the Gods"" 40 years ago. Why add this plot line to the ""Alien"" story? ""Alien"" was simple, direct, and to the point...humans are the creatures that put a sense of morality in everything they do. As horrific as the Alien monster was, it was simply trying to survive and it just so happens it needed human hosts to gestate its young in. The simplicity of nature's savagery (and we have examples of such parasitism on earth) made ALIEN, together with stellar performances and effects, the great sci-fi-horror-drama it was. PROMETHEUS developed a convoluted, full of plot holes, preachy back story to the saga that just sucked the life out of the storyline....and shameful repetition of some of the events from ALIEN along the way to try and up the horror ante. Epic failure."
2,A product placement movie,"Visually, very nice to look at. Depth of plot was pretty shallow, and I think it stems from rushing to get the movie out. Alot of Sci-fi is about product placement these days, ie, models, statuettes, memorabilia. And as I was watching the movie I got that impression that that was one of the motives for getting this out. But what really drove me crazy about this movie, was the incessant background music. A droning muzak that droned on and on during scenes where the acting and dialogue would have sufficed. If you watch ALIEN, and then this movie, you see and hear the diffence. Amazes me that both movies came from the same director."
4,Really good Scifi... Okay Alien Prequel,I really enjoyed this movie as a stand alone Scifi thriller. Good plot and good pacing. But I don't necessarily see it as a good prequel to alien. There was too much that could have been done better as a nod to that particular franchise. Hopefully the next one will tie in better.
4,Cool movie.,"The second time I watched it, I caught a few more things that made me realize it was a better prequel than I had originally thought. Somehow the first time I missed the 'biological weapon' aspect of the plot. Really enjoyed all the characters and obviously the special effects. Very good movie."
3,Can watch for VE,The movie was good with visual effects but had a poor story..The edited portion should not have been edited
4,PinPoint,"This movie was what I expected and more similarities to the ""Alien"" movie are obvious but make the movie that much more enjoyable."
3,Not Impressed,"This film had a lot going for it. It has great special effects, an interesting story, and some ok actors. For some reason, it didn't impress me. The story is about a mission to a distant solar system. The mission is to make contact with the alien race that supposedly genetically engineered humanity. When the space ship gets there, they discover that the planet was being used to produce living WMDs. The purpose of these weapons was to destroy the Earth. We never learn why this was being researched, or when it was going to happen. We do find out that the experiment went terribly wrong. The destructive organisms get loose and kill almost the entire crew of the research ship.This film seemed kind of out there. It reminded me a little of the Event Horizon movie. I loved Event Horizon, but this isn't even close to that good. It was a good idea, with flawed execution. I don't recommend it."
4,Prometheus on Amazon Instant Video,"Reviews seem really mixed on this one but both my husband and I really liked it. Just enough of everything I like in a movie, story line, action, a lot of good special effects. Noomi Rapace was excellent in this movie and Michael Fassbender was a real 'creep'."
