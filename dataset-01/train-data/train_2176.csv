4,great!,"This exhaustt kit was very easy to install, took me about 1 hour. the results were good. You get a nice sound when at idle not too loud but not too quiet. I could tell a difference in power but i do also have a air intake kit so that helps."
1,Not very manly & poor quality.,"I bought this exhaust to make my rumble bee ""rumble"". Wrong exhaust for that. Also the pipe going into the exhaust from the tail pipe was bent wrong and had to be welded because the brackets wouldn't clamp properly. Not a good exhaust for beefing up your Ram. I don't recommend it at all."
1,Horrible...,"Other words that come to mind are ""generic"" and ""forgettable"". If one were to equate a ""5"" rating to Led Zep IV then this would be the perfect album to equate a ""1"" rating to. The only listenable song is the cover of Shapes Of Things other than that this band seems like a heavy rock boy band fabricated by record executives. At times I was laughing when listening to this. You want to hear some serious heavy rawk? check out Halfway To Gone, Solace, and Artimus Pyledriver. They crush these wannabes. Flame On Suckas..."
4,"Good, solid, Kentucky Fried Rock","When ""Lonely Train"" hit the rock airwaves in 2006, it didn't change the world, but it was a bit of fresh air for a rock scene that was becoming increasingly stale. This is not to say that Black Stone Cherry is by any means original - the band proudly wears its influences on its sleeves (think a blend of Shinedown, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Soundgarden), but the band is more authentic than most. Lyrically, such as ""Rain Wizard"" and ""Backwoods Gold"" incorporate local Kentucky lore well, and John Fred Young's drumming is very strong. Most of the tracks on the first half of the album have excellent riffs - after ""Hell or High Water"", the tracks start to trail off somewhat. Still, this is Black Stone Cherry's best album, and doesn't stray too far into ""ballad land"" like future releases would, and is one of the better rock albums of the past few years."
5,Black Stone Cherry,"This is one of the few albums I wish I could give more than 5 stars to! It is excellent. The sound is raw and the riffs grab you, give you a good shaking and don't let go, and nor would you want them to! Each song is powerful and is perfect summer rock. They remind me of AC/DC, Led Zep and even Audioslave in places. I bought this on the back of an Amazon recommendation, and the reviews written here, and have to say I add my whole hearted endorsement. Go buy this album, you will not be disappointed. A top band and I can't wait for more.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Black Stone Cherry,Black Stone Cherry's CD is the best album that I have ever bought! Every single song on the CD is awesome! I love it! I clicked on five stars but for some reason it is showing 2...THIS CD IS a 5 all the way!!!
4,Simply the best hard rock album in years...no doubts!,"Nice blend of hard rock, southern influenced metal. Great stuff. A nice change from the usual thrash, rap influenced new metal garbage thats been released over the past 10 years. These guys are definitely a throwback. Very good musicians. The band is tight. If I could boldly make a comparison I'd say Zakk's Pride & Glory band (ealry nineties).My only question...when's the next release! Then we can tell if these guys are for real or not."
5,BUY THIS ALBUM OR DIE!!!,"Best band I heard in 18 years...It's a kick right up the Rock n Roll a**...And boy, can that guy sing or what..."
4,Simply kicks a__,"I don't usually buy music by new groups as I am tryin to catch up on all the old album music I have. I decided to try this one for some reason, and it was well worth it, I have a hard time takin it out of the player. Best new music I've heard by a new group in a very long time. I read the liner notes and can tell they are also a good group of young guys, givin thanks to God and their families, that says a lot right there. Anyway if U are readin this don't hesitate to buy this CD."
5,The Real Deal.....,"No gimmicks, no ""pretty faces"", no big budget marketing...just 100 % high energy, high octane old fashioned Rock N Roll !Jump in your car and crank it up....you are going to enjoy the ride :-)BUY, BUY, BUY"
3,I'M PART OF THE PROBLEM,"Mike Klein (David Duchovny) has written a sit-com based on his own life. He claims to have artistic integrity and doesn't want to be ""part of the problem"" with the substandard shows on TV. Once it looks like his show is going to be picked up, the network wants to make changes to his story. Mike is torn between his artistic integrity and his real life pregnant wife. Sigourney Weaver gives us another good performance as an alpha female and Ioan Gruffudd does a pretty good British guy in spite of a lackluster script.The pilot they are attempting to get picked up is pretty bad. It is not funny yet people laugh at it as if it was. The film dwells on a scene until ad nauseum. There are scenes that look like they might explode and go somewhere, by then die as if they never happened. Perhaps that was the intent, but it wasn't entertaining. 2 1/2 stars. Mildly amusing.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
4,The TV Set,"The TV SetI really enjoyed this movie, it's something a little different.All the actor's Duchovny, Weaver, Griffiths et al are all on top form.The actor's commentary is very funny and interesting.I would recommend this DVD."
2,A Film where the actors themseves probably had some real-life feeling connected to this film,"""The TV Set"" is a film that im sure alot of young (and old) writers can relate to. David Duchovny himself has probably had some real-life feelings connected to this film, due to the two hit shows he stars in, ""The X-Files"" and ""Californication"".""The TV Set"" is about writer Mike Klein (Duchovny). He has writen a pilot for TV. When Mike presents his idea to TV executives, they love his work, BUT, they want him to make changes here and there (which he is ok with), but when they ask him to change the ending of it, thats were he has the problem.""The TV Set"" has a great plot, and acting by David Duchovny and Sigourney Weaver.The reason I give it two stars, is it gets boring at times. Its like the producers had this great idea for a film, but it was not done the best way."
3,The TV Set,"This movie is watchable only because of David Duchovny. The plot is satirical but I found it more sad than funny. The acting was good, especially the young man who was the ""star"" of the projected TV sitcom. Sigourney Weaver is always excellent no matter what kind of part she plays. The actress who played David Duchovny's character's wife was especially physically unattractive. But, of course, I think the only women who match him in looks are Tea Leoni and Gillian Anderson."
5,"Excellent, life-changing book","Excellent book, and an important eye-opener for anyone! I cannot begin to say how much this book has helped change all of us in our church fellowship. We now require this book as a part of our church membership!"
3,Drive the Devil Out,Satans's offense is his most deceptive snare to set you out of God's will. You can be delivered from Satan.
1,Heavy on experience; light on rightly dividing God's word,"After reading the entire book I feel qualified to make the following review. Scripture makes a clear distinction between how to handle unbelievers/pagans that sin against us(Matt 5:39-42), and how to handle fellow believers that sin against us(Matt 18:15-17; 1 Cor. 5:9-11). John lumps everyone into one pot and draws the unbiblical conclusion that we should always turn the other cheek. He also seems confused about the repentance/forgivness relationship. He makes the assertion that forgiveness can come without repentance. The biblical model, and God's own requirement for forgiveness is a repentant heart(Luke 17:3-4; 13:3-5). True biblical forgiveness doesn't come without repentance. Save your money, but if you still want to read it that badly go check it out of the library."
4,A Must read for anyone whose ever been hurt or offended,"John Bevere's books are some of the most challenging and lifechanging books I have read. I consider his books The Devil's Door, The Bait of Satan and The fear of the Lord a must read for all believers.The Bait of Satan deals with the issues of offense and forgiveness. Christ taught us to pray ""Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us."" But do we do this? Do we forgive those who hurt us? John Bevere explores both the importance of doing this, and teaches how to deal past hurts and anger so that we can actually love as Christ loved us. An excellent and challenging book. If you read it with and open mind and a willing heart, God will use it to change your life; opening up new levels of healing and closeness to him."
4,A Must Read,"I read ""The Bait of Satan"" yesterday. I'm reading it a 2nd time today. Yesterday, I thought of those who have offended me; today with marker in hand, I'm thinking of those I've offended. This book delineates one of the most important principles of Christianity, forgiveness. The enemy knows this and uses offenses to move us away from the Will of God. This is a thoughtful, thought-provoking book. The world puts a high premium on vengeance and getting even, but we are commanded to forgive as we were forgiven. The gift of forgiveness keeps on giving to both the donor and the recipient. We are taught that forgiveness is a MUST in the Christian walk. I believe this book is a must in your library."
5,Definite Must Read,"John Bevere's book ""The Bait Of satan"" is phenomenal to say the least! He covers all the angles of forgiveness, unforgiveness, grudges and offesnses, and backs everything up with good solid scripture. I dealt with holding grudges and unforgiveness for many years, and after reading this book, the Lord set me free! Believe me, if you have issues with being offended, and not being able to let go, you have GOT to read this book. It will change your life!"
3,Bait of Satan,"First... in reading his first page... my response: YOU ARE GREEDY.Did you not know this is too a bait of satan?Anyway, the bottom line is something I already knew... save yourself the trouble... use the God given gift of Discernment the Good Lord gave to you to use in the first place.the whole book surrounds OFFENSE.Hey people, if you aren't offended in this day and age there is something wrong with you. It is how you respond to those offenses that matters.and if you think you want to teach a class on the subject... go to the Bible; not to this book. He tells you not to COPY it in any formation at all... even if you want to discuss it! Well Mr. Bevere, how do think a class is suppose to discuss something without viewing it? Oh, that's right... plug in... each person has to PURCHASE the B""OOK. Marketed Christianity for certain. Just read the New Testament... and it will teach you something about OFFENSES."
3,"OK, but read along with your Bible","I think many of his points could have been made without taking scriptures out of context. Also, there are many people that have a very difficult time changing churches or questioning wrong behavior in leadership. I only gave this 3 stars because he gives a lot of emphasis to forgiveness. Read all the reviews before mine, they are very good. (except the strange satanic one????)"
4,Book purchase,This product was purchased through Amazon. It came on time and was in great condition. I would buy from this seller again
1,"Similar car, same manufacturer","I don't have this exact car, but had a terrible experience with another RC car from the same company so wanted to share.My son got this as a gift for Christmas and within 24 hours of playing with the car, the transmission was stripped and the car would barely move. I have sent emails to the manufacturer many weeks ago and it took them over a week to respond. After several exchanges, they said they could not refund my money. They also said that since they were in Germany, they could not send a new car but they would send a new transmission that I could change myself. This was 6 weeks ago and still nothing. Very shady. Avoid at all costs. Overall a very disappointing experience. I would avoid this car and manufacturer."
3,nice but not what i wanted,"the cross i recieved wasn't quite the same as the one in the picture. in the photo on the page the cross looked more square, when i recieved it was more rounded on the sides. the bail is also larger than it looks the picture. the actual cross measures 37mm (just shy of 1 1/2 inches) and the bail is 15mm (just shy of 3/4 inch)."
3,Under-Appreciated U.S. Power Metal,"Great vocals, catchy as hell riffs, all wrapped into a fun, yet epic feel. Power Metal fans should own each and every Onward record, starting with this one. The best part of this album too, is the lack of gloss that European bands seem to fall into. This isn't fluffy, flowery metal, this is true, speed metal based U.S. power metal. Must have for traditionalists!"
2,Boring beyond my wildest expectations.,"I am going to have to side with the other reviewer who rated this album 2 stars. Although it shows a spark of talent here and there, the music written here would have been much better received in the 80's. And the vocals...well, how can I put this delicately. Mediocre and that's being to kind.As a vocalist of this genre myself, the lead vocals heard on this album lack emotion and range. Lead vocalists that inspire me these days and the guitar tones that have a new fresh sound come from true power metal virtuosos like Russell Allen/Michael Romeo(Symphony X), Fabio Lione/Luca Turilli(Rhapsody), Timo Kotipelto/Timo Tolkki(Stratovarius) & Khan/Thomas Youngblood(Kamelot)."
2,Beautiful cards,I am not a believer in the Tarot. I bought this set because the artwork was beautiful. One of the cards was missing so I sent the set back. Return/refund was timely.
3,Better over time,This wasn't quite as helpful as I'd hoped but it might prove more useful over time. It is fairly easy to read and the cards are extremely well illustrated.
2,Not quite,The book is fine but I did not receive any cards...I have been waiting to see if they showed up separately.
1,Instant Tarot Card and Book Set,"I received the book in the allowed time, but the ad stated ""book AND card set"". There were no cards included. I emailed the seller and received no response. I will not buy from this seller again."
3,"Nice looking cards, book is lacking","I like the cards, they are smaller and borderless versions of the Enchanted tarot, and though they are a little too busy for real interpretation, they are still very nice. The book however leaves a bit wanting, it is not as useful as it first appears to be. It gives meanings for each position of a card in the Celtic Cross layout, but basically each different position is the same sentence and meaning but just worded in the past, present, future tense. It also does not explain why the cards mean what they do, so you would have to rely on mesmerization instead of intuition. (as mentioned earlier, the cards are small and busy so it is hard to get a good intuitve feeling for them)."
3,"Cheaply made, but a good deal","This product arrived on time and in good condition. It features a wide variety of traditional folk songs, as well as songs written by Woody Guthrie and Seeger himself. At 3 discs it's a great deal, but the packaging is cheaply made and the 3 CDs have to be forced in and out of their flimsy display box. As soon as I found this out I just threw the box away and kept the 3 CDs in their separate plastic cases. Also, the papers in the front of the plastic cases are loose and keep sliding around and getting jammed up in the cases every time I open or close them. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product and would recommended it to any fan of American Folk/Roots music."
5,A revelation of Russian use of the HAARP capabilities.,Tells how Russia was ahead of the USA in perfecting our HAARP technology. Has pictures of the weapons and protective devices created from the low frequency technology of Tesla.
2,Disappointing,"MacUsers you have all this information built in. If you have Dreamweaver MX go to the HELP>Welcome to open the Welcome panel and from there you will be accessing the OSX help for Dreamweaver MX. Same content, it's all there.This title is almost as disappointing as the VQS for Golive (5 or 6). It's nothing more than a showing of how to press buttons in the UI.Don't get this book unless you need a really quick reference book. This is not a quick learn book. Many times while reading and working in this book you will find your self in a place only to be given direction to get online and check the books website. Excuse me? Why did I by this book for, to get online or to have the information right here.Yeh, thanks."
2,Not Enough Depth,"This book is basic. If you are new to Dreamweaver and want an entry-level book to get your feet wet with, this will do it. However, if you need more than that, you're going to have to buy additional material. This falls short."
2,I don't know about this book...,"Just reading the description makes me wary. Chicory is a diuretic which it fine if you have a problem with edema but it could possibly cause dehydration if taken too often and not drinking enough water is a major cause of high cholesterol. Guacamole is made with avocadoes, Avocadoes contain high amounts of saturated fat, although it is vegetable based. I don't think it matters. Flaxseeds are waxy based seed. What do you think wax would do to you blood or even your digestive tract? What is actually in the seed itself is beneficial but extracting it would be costly and therefore unaffordable for most people."
3,Pictures without in depth insights,I am disappointed with this book because it is solely a collection of great pictures of thirty or so Tibetan Lamas taken in a photographers' studio. I would have loved a paragraph from each man's lips. They are all men--another drawback. This book could have been wonderful if it had more depth. As it is this book misses expectations.
2,Confusing with the citations,"The concept the writer tried to develop is unique and pertinent to growing Christians. However, I found the vocabulary, citations, and the lack of flow in the topic to be exhausting to follow."
4,Easy Reading,"The format of this book can best describe as ""ask a question and give an answer"". Every topics start off with a question, follow by a small piece of code, and then an explaination of what each line of code does. This direct approach makes the book quicker to read, and in some way, it kind of goes without saying, ""cut the chase and get to the point!"".The contents touch base with many juicy topics. It has a brief introduction to the Standard Libraries such as String and Vector, enough to tease you in getting a full book on STD LIB (I did). It also does a decent job in covering inheritance and virtual class inheritance. Type casting and namespace usage is also covered. Polymorphism is covered but kind of weak."
1,MLK I have a dream,"If you thought you could hear ML King's I Have a Dream speech, you are sadly mistaken. There are just a few sentences."
4,Excellent speech.,"I'm living in germany.This is a speech which is surely one of the best ever spoken.It is a combination of excellent speech and a lesson of history.Something you should have in your collection.The quality of the DVD and material is not the most important thing. A text of the speech is not included for interested non US buyers, but you can get it in the internet.Regards,Lutz H."
3,Black History Month Video,Used during Black History Month for a unit on Speaking and Listening Skills. Can go directly to the speech with out extras or lengthen if need for lesson plan.
2,Martin Luther King Jr. - I Have a Dream,The movie was made cheap. The recordings are fuzzy. You can't really see a clear picture. The entire movie is pictures of the parades. I would not recommend this dvd.
3,Get arrested Tommorow in Zucatti Park...be a good NY person,unions ..unemployed homeless.. prostitutes.. drug dealers...orthodox jews catholics and born again.. senior citizens Gays lesbians Transgenders Military guys .. off duty cops ..off duty firemenGET ARRESTED TOMMOROW
4,i to have a dream,They say we wouldn't we shouldn't and we couldn't make it.They say that we are the odds of the crowd.We to have dreams.Dreams of seeing the sky.We to have dreams so don't come with whys.We are to motivated to start dividacation between this nation.We ALL are created equal just like the God created us.We have to much knowledge to come apart.
3,It's Alright,"There are a lot of good songs on here, with some are mix edited into another version. On the other hand, if you're a DJ or looking into something different sampling & beats, this is it for you."
1,THIS CD SUCKS,"This CD had a bad bad DJ... i bought this CD and retured it tha samn day! Dats how bad i thought it was, take my advise.. DONT BUY THIS CD!!"
2,Not orignal music,Does not sound right. Music in the background is not right. I hate when you take a nice song and try to make club music out of it. This rouins the real sound.
1,don't bother,"iI was hoping for some serious help but this book is pretty much an overview of conditions, with no help at all. I didn't check reviews before I ordered."
5,Throw out the trash,This is a good book showing how important it is to work with your body in all the elimination processes in stead of waiting or restricting.
4,A Russian Review!!!,"At the heart of the 'cellist's repertoire one can find the two concertos of Shostakovich. The concertos are completely contrasting examples of his compositions but they are without a doubt Russian. Natalia Gutman is the perfect person for the job of interpreting these works having studied with the dedecatee, Mstislav Rostropovich. Her voice is brimming over with confidence and holds your attantion throughout these live performances."
5,Excellent performances,"This disc incarnates three outstanding performances with Natalia Gutman on cello. The performed works and performers are the following:Shostakovich: Cello Concerto No. 1, op. 107. Kyrill Kondrashin, USSR Radio and TV Symphony Orchestra.Shostakovich: Cello Concerto No. 2, op. 126. Dmitri Kitayenko, Moscow State Philharmony.Schnittke: Dialogue for Violoncello and Seven Instruments. Yuri Nikolaevsky, Gnessin Chamber Orchestra.The main attractions are the two Shostakovich concertos with the two distinguished Russian conductors, Kondrashin and Kitayenko. Gutman is an excellent cellist, and these recordings must be counted among the very best. The recorded sound is satisfactory, even if not in demonstration class. Recommended without reservation."
4,Helpfull,Have been taking this for a while but always forget the 2nd dose so cant say it works great but has been helpfull
3,I dont see any changes so far,Lets see what happens till 3 months. It takes time for anything to happen so i will try it for some more time
2,Too many pills to take in one day,I love the price but could not swallow 3 pills twice a day along with all the other herbal supplements I take.
2,Capsules have a bad taste,The capsules are hard to swallow and leave a bad taste in my mouth after taking them. Would not recommend.
1,Not good,Took a pill at night and in the morning felt dizzy. Thought I was having a stroke or something. I stopped taking it and felt fine. I immediately through the pills away.
5,Didn't take it yet...,"I was receiving some newsletters about the benefit of taking this product, so I just ordered it... Looking forward to post an update."
5,nasal allergy,I recommend this along with the Marshmallow root as a tool to fight nasal allergy. I had NO LUCK at all with RX meds & a combination of these two: 1 cap ea of Marshmallow & l cap of Astragalus morning & night have helped condsiderably with my nasal allergy.
5,Boost immune system,This product has strengthened my immune system. I have not been sick since taking this product. This product is a must have...
5,Good Price,I use Astragalus for my healthy Boxer as an immune booster. I used it for years for my Boxer who had cancer. This is a good price.
3,ITS OKAY,"CANNOT TELL MUCH. I FEEL GOOD BUT I HAVE THE SNIFFLES, I TOUGHT THAT THIS PRODUCT WOULD BUILD UP MY IMMUNE SYSTEM OVER TIME TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.ED"
4,Feel Good,"I haven't been sick so far and don't know if it has anything to do with taking Astragalus, I'm on my 3rd bottle, I'll keep taking it and see if I make it through the remainder of the winter."
3,I don't know,I thought I could feel something at first when taking this but then nothing. I think I'm going to try these again and see what happens.
5,Perfect Practice!,"I am looking forward to 20 years time when I can have a baby and this is cool for practicing. Mummy doll is Midge but I call her Barbie! It comes with alot of accessories for the baby, not just furniture. The baby goes in the bouncer, or Barbie can cradle her/him. This is good practice but the pieces are VERY small and could get lost or be swallowed. But Barbie is a responsible mother and won't let her baby be lost or swallowed so the baby is nice and chubby. There is a cot with pink canopy for when baby gets tired and when baby gets hungry there is a bottle and some nappies and everything you need... including a purple rattle! Bye!"
3,"Very cute, but arm broke","My daughters are a little young for this toy and aren't that into it yet. It is very cute, with lots of sweet, tiny, realistic pieces, and I can see it having lots of play value and somewhat educational. However, they made it so the arms are jointed in order that she can hold the baby. Well, my daughter threw the doll on the floor at the doctor's office and the bottom half of the arm fell right off. Even if it hadn't broken, you have to place the arms just right or they look totally strange. This is the least favorite barbie my girls own. If it weren't for the arms, this would be a great toy. Oh, and the back of the dresser is open, so you can't really store the small pieces in it. Not sure why they didn't just close it up to make storage easier."
3,Bring back Happy Family,"This is not a Midge!Midge has freckles,and she doesn't wear a outfit like that!The Happy Family dolls came with better accessies than this!Mattel stopped making Happy Family dolls and now all they have is this doll.I want Happy Family back!"
4,Why,"Okay, what is mattel doing? They had a whole midge, happy family theme going, including grandparents, and it was great.They introduced the new neighbor, with no name and a baby.Now I went into toy'r us the other day, and I saw what looked like the happy family townhouse, but this one had the new neighbor, a husband, baby and little girl about kelly's age (all had no names.)What on earth are they doing? They should continue the Happy Family theme."
2,Not the best durable toy,My five year old daughter received this as a gift after her little sister was born. I thought what a great idea to give to a new big sister till right after taking all the pieces out of the box my daughter went to move the arm and the bottom part came off. She never even got to play with it before it broke. I don't recommend this as a toy to be played with. Maybe a nice gift to be left in the box but how fun is that to a child.
1,Are you serious?,"I love the sentiment behind this sticker, but perhaps a few extra minutes for proofreading to make sure ""loser"" was spelled right would have been beneficial."
4,27 Dresses DVD,I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for a 32 year old who saw the movie and enjoyed it enough that they want to have their own DVD of the movie. I also saw the movie and thought it was a very enjoyable romantic comedy.
4,Better than I hoped for!,"Even though it arrived in a pink case that was badly cracked, I didn't mind as I just transfered the cover into another case. I decided to watch the movie during the day while I was ironing. Certain parts at the end made me a little teary, and think of my sister. I recommended it to 2 20-year old twins trying to grow up and relate to each other as individuals - they LOVED it to. They sat together shoulder to shoulder watching, laughing and even crying a bit. Good fun, I think a guy could watch it and be entertained also by some of the scenes that are so funny."
2,"Expected a lot more...very, very juvenile","Oh my, I don't know what happened here but it seems that Katherine Heigl lost her acting ability in this movie...I kept wondering how this could be the same actress that's on television every Thursday night. All of the acting in this movie was overdone. I was surprised at just how bad it all was....story, acting, directing. It was so predictable and the characters were so elementary. The saving grace and the only reason this got 2 stars from me (and the reason I continued to watch even after I realized how bad it was) was James Marsden. His acting was good and the guy is beyond gorgeous. I think he puts Pitt and Clooney to shame. I'm surprised we haven't seen him as a leading man in more movies. I'm not sure that being able to look at this exceedingly handsome man for over an hour is enough to recommend the movie to anyone though. Very disappointing."
3,Contrived but entertaining,An absurd story that speaks the truth about the disproportionate value we place on weddings while neglecting the things that really matter in a relationship. Definitely a girls night out choice.
2,wasnt happy,"I tried to watch it more then once it was not well done. I was really upset. I watched because Katherine Heigl is a good actress. The movie had no point. She was in love with the guy that Katherine Heigls sister ""fall in love with"". She lied about everything. So obviously the wound up not together. Katherine Heigl was cute and bubbly like usual but overal the movie was not good."
1,B***h cannot act,When the female lead is as annoying and is such a bad actress as this woman then you know your movie has big problems. Save your money and time and stay away from this movie.
2,27 Sexual Encounters but no pizzaz.,"A woman chronicles her sexual encounters with twenty-seven different partners. She wrestles with her past promiscuity as she tries to lure an unsuspecting gentlemen into marriage. I was expecting something more like the Emmanuel series or Life on Top but this is very very tame in comparison. Beware, no nudity!"
3,Always a bridesmaid... retold... again,"Bottom line is that this is nothing but another feel-good Cinderella movie. It's predictable. It's got stereotypical characters and overused plot points. It's nothing new and exciting. But it's not the worst example of the genre, either. I actually liked the main character - she, at least, wasn't completely mopey and unhappy. She had a good outlook and attitude towards her bridesmaid-ness. The main guys were appropriately eye-candy-ish. The best friend was (of course) spunky and sweet. So, yeah, it was the same as dozens of very similar movies. And if that's what floats your boat, this is a perfect movie to add to your collection.If you're looking for anything ground-breaking and amazing, this is not it. If you're looking for an 'awwww, how sweet' romance, this will fit the bill. Not highly recommended, but I wouldn't stop a friend from buying it by performing a flying tackle in the middle of the store, either."
5,Cute movie,"In this movie 27 Dresses Katherine Heigi plays a woman name Jane. Ever since she was eight years old Jane has loved being part of weddings. She has been a bridesmaid 27 times. At one of the weddings Jane meets a newspaper writer named Kevin Doyle (James Marsden). At first Jane does not like Kevin. When her sister, Tess (Malin Ackerman) comes to to visit her. Tess meets Jane's boss, George (Edward Burns). Tess and George fall in love. George ask Tess to marry him. Jane is not happy about the upcoming wedding because Jane loves George. Jane and Kevin get to spend some time to get to know each other better. Watch the movie to see what happens to these characters. I hope people this enjoy this movie."
3,I'll Just Get Straight to the Point Here,"Yet another romantic comedy with a cutesy premise. We all know what this movie is about. You either want to see it or you don't. I could say how the humor was insightful, and the characters had depth, but would you believe me?3 stars = The ball is in your court"
4,27 Dresses,Can't get enough of Katherine Heigl. Izzie please come back to GA. I miis you and George. Just not the same.
3,Great Shower Gift!,"I purchased this DVD along with three others as a shower gift for a friend/co-worker. It is a cute movie, pretty funy, has a little language and inuendo in it, but nothing too horrible.I think there are plenty of movies out there that are much, much better of course - but I purchased this in the spirit it was meant - fluffy, funny, easy to watch, and good for a group."
2,I cannot understand these positive reviews!,"This movie was terrible. I did not buy that there was chemistry between the main characters and I thought that Heigls acting was sub-par at best. Usually with these types of movies you at least find some sort of connection with the characters. This story seemed like a poor attempt to imitate Runaway bride. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is for the supporting roles. The supporting actors performed well. I laughed at a couple of lines that Judy Greer had, she did great. Overall I found the movie to be predictable (like I have seen this before). It offered no new ideas and the characters, especially Heigl, were stiff. My wife who loves these types of movies was not impressed with this movie either! Especially after watching P.S. I Love you which rocketed up her list of favorite movies."
1,No Sparkle,"27 Dresses was a horrible movie. The romance was cold, and the comedy was lacking. Katherine Heigl was cute and is probably a wonderful actress, however, there wasn't any chemistry between her and her leading man James Marsden. Romantic comedies need strong romantic ties. Romantic enough to make the watcher feel that sigh of yearning for the same kind of relationship. Not once was there a kiss that would make a viewer shudder or dream of having a similar one. Katherine's biggest epiphany was to throw out all her dresses. This was a formula movie. It was very predictable and boring. The best shots were of the ugly dresses that the heroine wore to all the many weddings she had attended. Throw this movie in the can and burn it at the next Hollywood set fire!"
4,G8 ESCAPE,It was a very cute and very romantic movie. I am a big Katherine H. fan! Love her from Grey's Anatomy and I think she will be at great as Katherine Hepburn if she keeps up the way she has been doing.
4,27 Dresses DVD,"This movie has humor, drama, and romance - with actors who excellently fulfill their roles. highly recommended."
3,Easy Viewing,"27 Dresses is a light predictable comedy. A very good teen movie or a nice movie to view with ""the girls"" on a Saturday evening."
3,Cute,"This is a cute flik. As long as you're looking for entertainment and not something deeper, I'd recommend it. A couple of hours of light entertainment."
5,Great movie,"I loved this movie. I think James Marsden is the best leading man I have seen in a long long time. Katherine Heigl is a better looking, better acting Ashley Judd. I really thought everything in this movie worked. The only thing that could have improved it is more screen time for Judy Greer. She is a total riot."
2,pretty blah,"My title pretty much explains it. Katherine Heigl is pretty forgetable in this movie as she just seems so ordinary and boring. There's no Oomph in this movie, it's just blah."
2,"More like A ""Lifetime For Women"" Movie, Blah!","This movie certainly isn't worth buying. I wouldn't have been happy paying for it in the theater either. Luckily, I watched a friends copy.What a bust!!! This movie is a weak story, with everything predictable. I was very disappointed. Save your money."
1,Disappointing--glad I didn't buy it,"Very briefly, this movie is rated PG-13. I am a mom of teens who would have been very uncomfortable viewing it with my own or any 13-year-old. I watched it with a 15-year-old and wondered if we are so numb or desensitized that we assume every teen over 13 years wants to see and hear about sex with strangers and getting drunk.As another reviewer said, this is a chick flick, yet quite a put down for women who aren't or don't want to be married. Maybe this just hit me the wrong way--I did not know any of the actors either so I had nothing to compare their acting ability to."
1,HORRIBLE CHICK FLICK... DONT BUY IT,"This is awful. If you read the reviews by every reputable film critic who panned it, they are right. It rehashes and spews movie vomit leftovers from My Best Friend's Wedding and other countless wedding maid of honor finally gets the guy movies. It's a chopped/screwed (bootleg music lovers understand the lingo) mess of a movie that I wasted money on. Rent it from NETFLIX or buy it when its in the $5 movie bin at Walmart or just don't watch it."
5,27 Dresses,"This is one of the better romantic comedy's! My husband even enjoyed it. So grab the popcorn, a few girl friends, or husband and watch this delightful film."
2,I wanted to love this movie,"I just got around to watching this movie on DVD. I'm a fan of romantic comedies and an even bigger fan of James Marsden. Katherine Heigl was very good but I just didn't connect with her character. I just found it odd that everyone was supposed to know that Jane was in love with her boss but her own sister DIDN'T KNOW??? I didn't like Jane's best friend either. The way Jane almost killed them in the car accident didn't seem to forsee a romantic hook-up. The only saving grace of the bar scene was having Marsden sing a few bars. Marsden has a great voice and I loved him in Hairspray. Overall, a so-so movie at best. The performances save this from being a total bomb."
4,cute movie,"Overall, this is a fun lighthearted movie that moves at a brisk pace. I recommend seeing it, it's a chick flick but it's funny enough that guys will be able to watch it too.*spoilers ahead*This is a cute movie. Katherine Heigl plays her beautiful a and neurotic self (why do they always make her neurotic?) in a typical rom-com that revolves around a woman's competing desires for two different guys. One of those two guys is a bit darker, the other a bit nicer, in this story the main character goes for the nicer guy."
3,27 Dresses,"Jane is idealistic, romantic and completely selfless--a perennial bridesmaid whose own happy ending is nowhere in sight. But when younger sister Tess captures the heart of Jane's boss--with whom she is secretly in love--Jane begins to reexamine her ""always-a-bridesmaid..."" lifestyle. This movie is pleasant by the likeability of its star, Katherine Heigl, and her chemistry with the affable James Marsden."
4,LOVING MOVIE,Some of these reviewers really need to just get over themselves. This is a feel good love story. Good acting. Good music. and 27 great dresses.
3,28 days and 27 dresses?,"We have wedding crashers and star crossed lovers, and all sortsof chicks flicks in between. These movies are actually good for men who have no idea how women's minds work. I liked this movie, but yesterday I saw one that was half way between this and an actual action movie,so I have to rate it lower, but I think women will really like this movie.It is just a little too gooey for me.The girl gets her man in the end."
2,waiting and waiting,"I ordered this film over a month ago with hopes of giving it as a Christmas present. I received every other item I ordered from Amazon, even things ordered as recently as two weeks ago, but still no movie. I don't know if it is laziness or stupidity but it is annoying as hell when it takes this long to receive an item."
2,not very good,"I had really high hopes for this movie when it came out especially since it had Katherine Hiegl in it because I love her in Grey's Anatomy. It ""looked"" good but I was wrong. I was really bored for most of the movie and it's just as predictable as other chick-flicks. I love romantic comedys but this is just crap. See Bridget Jones Diary or When Harry Met Sally instead if you haven't seen it(love those movies).I didn't see any chemistry between Kate and James either. Katherine played the role fine but I just don't find her funny. Sure she was in Knocked Up which was hilarious but not on her part. I think drama's are her best bet, that is where she really shines!"
2,Not what I expected...,"This movie was just okay... If you're looking for a cute light hearted entertaining movie then you may be dissapointed by this movie. The female characters in the movie were portrayed as being uptight, sarcastic, and harsh."
2,Poor imitation of a romantic comedy,"The people who wrote, directed and produced this movie would do well to take a crash course in Cukor, Capra, Hawks etc. Lazy, unimaginative writing and directing yield a script full of cliches and characters whose motivations abruptly shift directions with no justification whatsoever. Not at all believable."
4,"Very sweet and, dare I say it, ""cute"".","I knew the ending right from the start (who wouldn't figure that out?), but I had to watch it. James Marsden was in it, hello! That's the first reason, but also because I'm a sappy romantic who loves chick flicks!I didn't like Katherine Heigl that much before she started doing movies, but she is growing on me with each new film. Her character in this is very admirable for doing all she does for friends and not saying ""no"" to people. She's a hero at times, really. And when the hero gets trampled, of course you want to see her lifted up and given the respect and happy ending with the perfect wedding she deserves. Oh, and I loved her adorable apartment!Good, good!"
2,hold off on buying,"I rented this movie rather than purchase it after reading the reviews. I'm glad I didn't buy it. The movie was okay, but I was overall disappointed. I thought the Tess person, the sister, was really a poor actress; simply put, trying to copy Carmeron Diaz's acting style. I lacked pizazz and was just an okay movie. Won't be buying this one."
2,Looked Better online,Up close I thought this appears very cheap. It looked nicer online. I guess you get what you pay for!
5,BRACELET,"I am greatly satisfied with this bracelet. It is very beautiful, easy to put on and arrived very quickly. I may be ordering more in the future."
4,Wonderful!,"I got this as a present for my friends 18th birthday and she loved it! The bracelet fit her well and it is very pretty, I am planning on getting the Aunt version and graduation version for others because it's fabulous. Also, I ordered from MyJewelThief, the estimated delivery was the 6th through the 9th and it got here the 3rd. I give this a 4 stars, however, because there was a noticeable defect on one of the silver beads and the last ""r"" is ""Forever"" wasn't black; I would have returned it if given the time."
4,Great for the price!,"I am having a baby shower and wanted to get something special for my 3 hostesses. I found these braclets and thought they would be perfect! I just got them in the mail today so the shipping was average time for standard shipping. They are very cute but feel a little cheap, I was expecting the clasp and dangling heart to be a little heavier but what can you expect for $13.00... overall I am happy with them all, I like how they come in a little decorative box with the card inside. I would recommend as a small gift."
1,Not the original Citadel...,"THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL CITADEL - I should know, my parents are the ORIGINAL band named Citadel - and Musea should know better, they also know this very well from the early 90's...anyways, the Original CITADEL started in 1979 and is still going strong today - despite the many unimaginative bands who try to steal their name...my parents albums are on sale here at AmazonCitadel of Cynosure & Other Talesand at CDBaby, as well as on their official websites...too bad infringers put so much time and energy into their products but don't even check to see if someone else owns the name they choose to use..."
2,for scholars only,"written way above the laymens level(this layman, anyway).found it hard to follow and confusing.does not address 'the big question' of divine inspiration of scripture to my satisfaction."
5,It Didn't Fall Out of the Sky,"Jaroslav Pelikan's ""Whose Bible Is It?"" has helped me appreciate more fully the complex process that led to the Bible we have today. In 250 pages Pelikan sketches the most important stages in the history of the Bible for both Jews and Christians. It covers not only with the original writing of the texts, but also the issue of the canon (both Christian and Jewish), the Septuagint, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and modern critical methods.I have now read two of Pelikan's books (the other is ""Mary Through the Centuries"") and I am impressed with his readable style. They are both accessible to the lay reader. ""Whose Bible Is It?"" works well as both a historical survey and a teaser creating within the reader a desire to know more."
2,Disappointing,"It begins well, with the promise of moving through time in an analysis of how the various peoples of the Book reshaped the book (and their thinking). But it majorly peters out, and I think it reflects a basically lazy attitude on the part of the author. While there is a nod and a wink toward Rashi and Maimonides and a little later Gershon Scholem, Jewish attitudes and thinking are frozen around the second century. No attempt is made to sort out the various Hasidic and other Jewish approaches to the original texts as they occurred over time, or to explore how Talmudic scholarship grew and changed in The Pale. Quakers and millenarians are absent from the Reformation, as are Unitarians later. The book has no index, and the argument, after the first couple of chapters is relatively difficult to follow.It's a great subject, but awaits a better treatment."
2,Disappointing,"Mr. Pelikan is a renowned expert on this subject. He is erudite and his words are chosen with an eye towards accuracy that is rarely seen today. Maybe that's my dilemma with this work. Mr. Pelikan's gentle style lacks a firmness and directness that I typically appreciate. He writes so subtlety that I find it difficult to explain what this book was about and what its implications are except on the most general of terms. Several times in the course of reading this book, I had to re-read a passage multiple times to grasp what his point was. It can be argued that I may be obtuse or lack knowledge in this subject. And while that may be true, I was looking for something more from the author and he didn't deliver the goods. I wanted to hear from Mr. Pelikan the ""So What?"" or his take on the significance of something I invested my time into."
3,Mad!,"1st off I love Mystic force..but what I dont like is how they skiped so many good episodes!I got this dvd with vol#3 as well and was shocked at how crappy there treating the dvd relase of this great show.2nd off the dvd menu is the same one they used the past 2 times..with the same music and everything...the same layout....and its just getting old.I could live with that but when I played the episodes I was madder than any bad guy on this show! They skiped the episode where madison gets turned to stone,and the 2-parter ""Stanger within"" where Vieda becomes a vampire!(WHY!?) And vol#3's order makes no sence at all..Daggeron just pops out of nowhere on the Bonus episode... and I'm sure there is more skiped episodes I just cant think of them at the moment.I hope the next volume has the episodes that they skiped.(Maybe they want vol.4 to be about the Blue and Pink rangers and make a vol. just for them.) Thats fine with me, But I would have like to seen all the episodes in order."
3,"the Megazord: earned, lost, and regained","this DVD is a whirlind of action, lessons, and new ranger weapons. In the first episode Rock solid Nick is responsible for Madison's turning to stone. However their making up unlocks the brand new titan Megazord! In Whispering Voices Koragg summons Red Ranger for a showdown on the beach. however the battle leads to Koragg's capture of the Megazord's combining power! And in Legendary Catastros Nick is trapped in a dark dimension with Koragg's Zord-like horse. However Nick ends up combining with him to become the Centaurus Pheonix Megazord only to lose him and regain the Titan Megazord combining power. I recommend this DVD to anyone starting power rangers fan"
3,just a question real quick.....,Don't know how many stars to give this. i just have a question for someone who owns this. How many episodes are on this dvd?
5,"IF BAD SOUND WERE FATAL, AUDIO WOULD BE THE LEADING","THE BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT. I'M NOT IN THE AUDIO INDUSTRY BUT I FOUND THE BOOK A ""FUN"" READ. YOU CAN FEEL HOW MUCH THE DAVISES LOVE PEOPLE, THEIR WORK TEACHING AUDIO SEMINARS, TRAVEL IN RV'S FOR OVER 20 YEARS WITH TWO DOGS AND TWO CATS, AND RURAL COUNTRY LIVING WHEN THEY WEREN'T TRAVELING. I AM PROOF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AUDIO TO ENJOY THE BOOK."
1,Avoid at ALL COSTS!,"This album was just so god-awful that I felt I needed to warn you... if you don't believe me, listen to the clip of ""Rhinoceros"" below. the only reason this got one star is because that was the lowest I could possibly give."
1,Insult to Billy Corgan,As a pumpkin fan i was offended to no end. This was just horrible...just horrible. They slaughtered the vocals. Only good thing about it was when it ended. just Why???
1,Truly an Insult to The Smashing Pumpkins.,"I don't know if Billy Corgan, D'arcy, James, or Jimmy actually liked this album, but they shouldn't of. This album is horrible and an insult to the true talent behind the original songs. I think this should never have been considered as an album. Don't get me wrong...The only true problem with the cd is that it was, well....a gothic industrial tribute. If you want something to listen to then listen to the originals. This album should never be inserted into a cd tray anywhere. Stay away from this. I'm sorry Billy Corgan's lyrics went to waste on such horrible sounds."
2,Slaughtered what vocals?!?,"I totally disagree with the other critics of this CD, though I do not own it nor do I care to, being not a huge fan of the late band, Smashing Pumpkins. I really disagree with the 'slaughteredvocals' statement. What vocals?!? Billy Corgan can't, never couldand never will, sing. The best part about the Smashing Pumpkins' music was the music, and lyrics. The vocals totally stank--Billysounded like a puppy being tortured half the time. I am very muchinto Gothic/Industrial as opposed to Grunge/Alternative, but likeI said, I'd never buy this CD. I just listened to a friend's--andI prefer German underground sounds anyhow."
3,A good album.,".....Anyways, this should be treated as a remix album with a different vocalist. As this does NOT sound like the pumpkins.If you like industrial or goth, you should pick this up. As it is pretty neat to see how the Pumpkins could have been. One of the neatest examples of this is '1979' by Pig."
3,"Not that bad, only bad if you dont like change!","this is not all that bad, i mean they do their own take on this songs. it wouldnt be that fun if it sounded exactly like the originals. when the pumpkins cover a song they change it around too cause they know the standard version will be dull."
2,"Huge fan of The Smashing Pumpkins,but not of this CD.","My very first impression of this disc was that it was awful.I don't know anything about Gothic music,so I figured I would stay with a band's music I already know.Rhinoceros,God and Bullet with Butterfly Wings aren't that great.In fact I would say they're quite bad,but The End Is The Beginning Is The End,Ava Adore and others are good.The reason I didn't like some of the songs is because they sound really spacey and over done.Plus Some of the vocals sound like a cross between Billy Idol and Elvis with a demonic flair.Some of this was almost too funny to listen to.But if you're a huge Pumpkins fan and must have everything even remotely related to them buy it,if not I suggest you don't bother."
1,Gothic-Industrial Disgrace,No band deserves this. Especially not the late and great Smashing Pumpkins. May God have mercy on these artists.
3,"Could've been better, could've been worse","I like both the Pumpkins and industrial music. And I think the Pumpkins music could translate well into gothic industrial music, as the Pumpkins were already clearly influenced by that style on some level. That's one of the things that separated them from the other music in the mid-90s. The problem here is that most of the bands chosen to do the covers weren't very good...The best ones were The End Is The Beginning is The End, Cherub Rock and Frail and Bedazzled, with an honorable mention to a noble attempt at Disarm."
2,Eh...,This is not for everyone. I personally don't mind goth or industrial music so some of the tracks were interesting and I liked them. Others are terrible and should never have even been attempted. I could go either way on this album. (The cover of Rhinoceros should NEVER have been done. It's too beautiful a song to butcher like that.)
5,YES!,"THIS CD INCLUDES 3 TRACKS: ORIGINAL, DJ SHOG REMIX, & THE HIVER AND HAMMER REMIXVERY NICE IF YOU LIKE EURO TRANCE/DANCE"
3,It's hell what can I say!,"I read this in High School and spent a considerable amount of time to understand a few crude jests and know that hell was full of local italian politicians, grafters, and betrayers of public trusts of one sort of another. Once you some understanding it's a moral tale and expression of frustration at untrustworthy people. I was happy to learn it but it was a lot of footnotes to know to whom the author was referring. Was it most noteworthy because he could express such an opinion at that time?My humanities teacher in school was quite patient with us and me in particular due to my outspokenness to jest when an idea made no sense to me.Give hell a try."
5,Dante's inferno,"Dante's Inferno is the best book ever written. Dante's trip through hell was extremely exciting. I read it a month ago, and it is still fresh in my mind. If you are squeamish this book is not for you. There is a lot of torture in hell and the author describes it in great detail. If you read this book you will love it. This book is exciting and will keep you up late into the night, and if you read it, it will be your favorite book too!"
5,SCHOOL,REQUIRED READING FOR HIGH SCHOOL. MY DAUGHTER SAID SHE LOVED THE BOOK AND WAS GLAD THAT SHE READ IT. I'D RECOMMEND IT.
3,Required Read,Had to order this for my daughter to use in school. Good story just hard to read. But she would also like to read the rest of the series.
2,Kindle Edition: Disgusted By The Typos,"I was so excited to add this wonderful classic to my Kindle Library. However, after getting only to the third canto, I have come across, and highlighted 12 typos! At first I thought I could just ignore them, but it has gotten so bad that I can't even finish reading this. I am so disappointed! This is not the only Signet Classic with typos I have gotten either. A few weeks ago I purchased the Kindle version of Les Miserables also by Penguin Publishing. Riddled with typos. It sickens me that these companies pump out this crap and sell it to loyal customers. It is obvious that there has been absolutely zero effort in proof reading these wonderful classics."
1,Completely ruined by typos and NO editing,"I love The Divine Comedy, and Ciardi's translation is a thing of beauty. That said, the Kindle edtion is almost impossible to read. There are at least three typos on every page, and sometimes a lot more that that. It is blatantly obvious that absolutely no editing was done on this edition at all. Do not spend $5.99 for this edition. I seriously recommend that you buy a print copy of The Divine Comedy if you would really like to read it. Whoever was responsible for this Kindle abomination will surely find his or her place in one of the nine circles of hell."
5,Two thumbs up,"""The Inferno"" as translated by John Ciardi was wonderful for a first time reader of the work. The introduction did a good job of setting up the background information of Dante's life, which played a big role in his writing of ""The Inferno."" The summaries before each canto also did an excellent job of preparing the reader for what each canto was about. What I especially liked were the notes at the end of each canto which were very helpful in clarifying some confusing terms or other historical references Dante made. ""The Inferno"" is already so well written, the notes by Ciardi just allow the reader to have a more informed reading of the book, which leads to a much fuller experience overall."
1,"Great book, terrible edition!","Although this is the first printing by Signet Classic, June 2001, it is a terrible photo-typeset. It has all the appearance of a photocopy of a photocopy of a mimeograph.The font is ugly, old, hard on the eyes, and was probably an original in 1954 when it was first published. Has any publisher bothered to re-typeset Ciardi's translation in the last 50 years?Why, oh why, did I pay [the price] for the 3 volumes when it is such a horrible edition? Is John Ciardi's translation still copyrighted, or has it fallen into the public domain?Save your money and find a new, fresh, typeset edition! Ciardi's translation is printed by a half-dozen publishers. Good luck."
5,Great Poetry,Dante has become one of my favorite poets. He's up there with Homer and that's kind of funny since in Limbo he is excepted in the circle of some of the greatest poets which included Homer.This is a nice translation and the commentary is excellent. John points out certain things in the verses which you would have to have some familiarity or go and look up elsewhere to understand its significance to the poem.In this volume Dante speaks about the nature of sin (the specific punishments helps to amplify it meaning). It also shows how the straight path (to God) is not an easy one to simply step back onto if you happen to slip because these sins (shown in hell) will be a stumbling block and hold you back (represented by the 3 creatures he meets before he has to take the hard journey through hell).There are some memorable moments in the bowels of hell which I will not forget and Virgil (reason) is a great guide.
3,the intellct of John Ciardi has been smeared,"I had to stop reading this to write this quick review. The translation itself is truly remarkable. John Ciardi is a brilliant mind. However, whoever transferred the actual book to the kindle format did a painfully poor job. Horrific. The commas are periods and mispelled words have become mundane. I am not happy that I paid 5 dollars for this."
4,very good,"I read this when I was 14 and it may seem strange, but I liked it very much. Of course it wasn't (in my opinion) 5 stars, I'd give it a worthy 4 1/2 (if I could). The book was very different from anything I've ever read (not surprising with what schools have to offer), I take it into my own hands to read what I find interesting, and I'm glad I read it. If your looking for anything out of your usual norm, you should give this book a try. *** John Ciardi's translation was excellent ***"
3,"Translation fantastic, Kindle edition is not fantastic","I was disappointed to find so many typos in this Kindle edition. It appears that they've just scanned the printed book and then taken a single pass of OCR and called it a day. There are dozens of typos. For example, what is meant to read ""fire!"" is rendered as ""firel"". Sure, you can figure out what the word is supposed to be but it takes you out of the moment of reading poetry. I wish the publisher would release an updated version of this ebook that removed these errors."
1,Unconscionable Errors in Kindle Edition,"Let there be no doubt that Dante's Inferno is a true classic. Let there also be no doubt that the Kindle edition offered here is simply atrocious! Dozens upon dozens of typographical errors and malapropisms mar a literary work of art. Absolutely no effort, whatsoever, could have been made by the publisher to proofread this document before submitting it for purchase. I would strongly recommend that Amazon take this e-book off its website. Allowing publishers to sell books that are well below sub-par in quality is, frankly, inexcusable."
2,Kindle edition = typos,"Reading kindle version on kindle fire:As the cantos progress so do the typos. Throughout the 8th circle I've been referencing the paper back edition for corrections.One Example:Opening of Canto 25:""When he had finished, the thief--to his disgracerai-sed his hands with both fists . . .""There seems to be about one or two of these per canto.Please fix!"
3,Nice translation for newbies but not the best,"Prepare for Dan Brown's Inferno, read the real thing first.I know, opinions on translations are completely subjective. Having said that, I enjoyed Ciardi's version but always returned to Mark Musa's. Ciardi's forced rhymes left me feeling that the context and clarity of the story suffered. His notes aren't bad, but once you've read this translation take a look at Musa or Hollander (their notes are far superior also).Warning: make sure you get the right translation, Amazon occasionally will mix these up in the description and reviews.Afterlife - An Introduction to Dante's Inferno[...]"
3,best book,the inferno is one of the best books i have ever read. if you like edgar allen poe you'll love dante's brilliant masterpiece the inferno. his trip through hell is wounderfully written and gives detailed information on what he thinks hell is like. if you have a queezy stomache don't read it. many punishments are disguesting.
3,The Inferno,"This translation is great, if you're not a purist. I think it reads better in English when the lines aren't forced into rhyming. The prefaces and the notes at the end of each section really helped me keep up with the story.I have to wonder, though, why Dante wrote this. Did people in his time really believe that he'd gone to Hell? If they thought it was just a work of fiction, then what's the purpose of the story? The punishments are strange and somewhat disgusting. There's a lot of symbolism and poetic justice in there, but it's distasteful all the same. Is this the best God could do?The center of Hell is something of a disappointment, too. Brutus, Cassius, and Judas -- these are the worst sinners in all of history up to that point? Seriously.Overall, this book gets three stars. If you're going to read The Inferno, Ciardi will get you through it. Unfortunately, even the best translation can't make up for a story about a woman putting Dante through Hell."
3,Dante provides a vivid description of hell.,"An ancient masterpiece, yet the divisions of hell are repetitive and reading this classic as a high school student was slightly boring."
5,A Classic that needs Modernization,"No doubt one of the best works of literature known to us. Although influenced by the events of his day, Dante would have made a great writer and thinker in our time. My dream is to write a follow-up to Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" using events since the time of Dante, and presenting more subjective views of religion and the afterlife. I plan to start this project in the near future and who knows how long before it's completion........could be years. I think this would be a novel idea and I have yet to see any other such modern day works."
1,tHE iNFERXON,"The book was in rather bad shape. With all the the writings, etc,.it made it hard to read. Would not order from this site again."
2,Everyone is going to hell.,"Still complicated with translation. Challenging to read, I could not have read this book if I did not have to do it for homework. I felt really grim reading it. Basically everyone can go to hell in this book."
3,"Pretty good, but editing and printing not great.","In general, the translations in this little dictionary and phrasebook are correct. Unfortunately, however, there are several errors in editing. For example, on page 80 we read ""Consumption of alcohol in public places is permitted in Sweden."" Presumably this was supposed to say that it is NOT permitted in Sweden. In addition, the type doesn't always show the accent marks over the letters. For example, in the glossary on page 106, we find ""svara"" defined as meaning ""to curse, to swear."" In fact, however, ""svara"" (without two dots over the first a) means ""to answer,"" and ""svära"" (with two dots over the first a) means ""to curse, to swear."" This is a significant difference! This failure to print the accent marks correctly is evident on many pages of the book (and it appears to be a printing error, not an error by the authors)."
2,Disappointed with Hippocrene,"First of all, I didn't buy this version of Hippocrene's Swedish-English dictionary, but the larger one, so I have never actually seen this book. But I was shocked to find out (once I began studying Swedish more intensively) that my version of Hippocrene does NOT tell you whether the nouns are ""ett"" or ""en"" words! My God, how could these boneheads have decided to create a dictionary about the Swedish language without this essential information? It makes the book nearly useless, and I have had to start over and buy a new one. I don't have any recco's for a dictionary yet, but I am going to try Prisma. Try to get a dictionary that tells you whether nouns are common or neuter gender, and also how the nouns look in the definite and indefinite plural. The latter is the hardest part of Swedish to learn, in my opinion."
5,Shift Improver Works Great!,"The electronic shift improver worked great on my 94' chevy k1500. The tranny has 170,000 miles on it but shifted like new. The shifts are sluggish though especially with the 35"" tires I have on it. The electronic shift improver installed very easily. All I had to do was cut and splice two wires from the plug-in attaching to my computer box. It works instantly putting more pressure in your transmission lines. I normally run stage one and the shifts are wonderful. Stage 2 feels like a performance offroad shift kit... almost too much banging into gear sometimes! Overall great product and cheap without having to remove transmission pan."
5,B&M Shiftplus for awesome,I bought this for my 1997 Chevy Silverado 2wd 5.7L/350 ext. cab. It only took me about 10 minutes to put in. The only hard part was finding where I wanted to mount the switch. I keep the switch on position 2 and I love the way the transmission feels now. It is for sure worth the money. You will not be dissapointed.
4,Soul Survivor (4.5 stars),Lacy Foxx is a sexy independent sistah struggling in the relationship department. After breaking off an engagement to Sebastian Lacy falls head over heels for Wynn Trust. But is Lacy more to blame for her failed relationship with Sebastian (or Se-bastard as she calls him) than she initially realized?But that realization that she was also to blame comes a little too late and leaves Lacy torn between her past with Sebastian or a future with Wynn. Author Michelle Buckley delivers an excellent novel showing that in order to maintain a healthy relationship with anyone you must first work on your soul.
4,Good book for first novel,I thought this book was pretty good to be the first novel by Michelle Buckley. I think that she will be around for quite sometime and we will see her writing grow stronger. I look forward to the next read.I thought Lacy was a very strong character that eventually did what was best for herself in the end. She decided to stick to her moral beliefs and not give into Winston. He seemed to only be able to love her in his own way and not the way that she needed him to and also as honestly has he should have.
4,Bulletproof Soul,"The book was very fast pace, entertaining, and covers issues in life we all at some point dealt with. The loss of love ones, love and trust, infidelity and betrayal, family and friendships. Lacy represent the strength and the weakness that would bring out the best in us.The story is about Lacy, a reporter who agreed to do an interview with Winston, the director of a youth center who's sexy, wealthy and have it going on with secrets that will rock Lacy trust. Lacy finds herself mixed in some baby mama drama, drive- by shooting, conflict with her job, and playing match maker with her grandmother.Lacy Foxx, eventually finds the ultimate happiness in herself by wearing her bulletproof soul."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought from the title of the book, and from the reviews it would be exciting. I found the book hard to stick with, and the storylines were not completed."
4,"Great texture, great flavor, highly addictive","I'm giving these a slightly less than perfect rating simply because they aren't as good as the original Shrimp Flavored Chips (without Wasabi). The wasabi is kinda weak - I was hoping for something that would take my breath away like real wasabi - but the flavor is there - just not as much kick as I was hoping for. I think if they made the commitment to stronger wasabi, it would have been a 5-star product. Nevertheless, they are really good."
3,how about an update?,"Like a recently reviewed Kirk-Othmer text that was from 1995, this reference book could do with an updated edition. Indeed as I write this, perhaps that is in the works. The current volumes were published in 1989 and were an excellent synopsis of the uses of lasers in this field.But there has been much progress with lasers in the interim. The book touches briefly on the femtosecond pulsed lasers. Actually, these were then using pulses on the order of 100 fm, and it was all still very experimental. Now, in the last 16 years, the usage of pulsing in the sub-100 fm range is far more common for studying fast reactions, amongst other applications. Though to what extent these lasers are used in polymer work, I do not know. But a newer edition might disperse this uncertainty."
3,Don't be an idiot,"Okay, if you already have Cry for the Desert, Beyond a Dream or A Heart that Knows You, I would say to just buy the title track, save yourself a couple bucks.If you don't already have those songs, but plan on buying those albums just buy the title track, if you have Greatest Hits Time & Again, you don't need to buy this album. It has that song already.So in essence, check your CD's before making this purchase."
5,"Hardpounding, fastpaced, destruction!!",Incredible! It's about time someone took dm back to what it should be. All hail The Forsaken! This CD KILLS!!
4,great cd,I look every were for this cd and i finally found it. If you like fast death metal with good lyrics get this.
3,The original 'Gone in 60 seconds',I purchased this as a gift for my husband who kept seeing the new one on tv but never the old one.He enjoyed watching it again and said that the old cars were the best part.
4,How one makes an action movie,"I have the 25th ann. edition and I don't mind it with the remastered soundtrack. I wish the DVD producers would've had the original version on the b-side though.Ok, the acting and plot may have some issues, but it's still far better than anything Hollywierd has put out in the past decade. Don't watch this movie to study it for English or Art class - it's a pure 'late night drive-in' style movie.My favorite aspect of the 1974 ""GONE IN 60 SECONDS"" is no faked stunts. The car crashes are real, the fire is real, the action is real. This sums up to a lot of kinetic energy a computer can't reproduce. The latest movies look like a video game or cartoon. People got hurt making this movie which shows heart. If I were to make a movie I'd make one like HB Haliki did.The worst part of the movie is when a Plymouth Barracudda gets crushed by a garbage truck.Watch it at face value - for the classic '70's aura."
1,i don't have the product!,"I don't have the product, please i need to know the tracking number. thanks!XX XX XX XX XX XX"
3,Eh.,"Not a great film. Not a prompt to make the toilet your friend either. If you need intellectual stimulation of some sort, you'll hate it. But if you like cars, it's not bad to have in the background while you work from home in your pajamas."
1,borring,I had seen the new Gone in 60 Seconds and wanted to see the old one. After seeing it I was greatly disappointed. The plot was boring and especially the 40 minute car case. The guy just drives arround wrecking cars and you wonder when its going to end. But this is my opinion and you might like it I don't know so rent it and watch for yourself before you buy it.
2,Skip it!,"A stinker--lousy--terrible, unless you get your thrills stealing cars or imagining yourself stealing cars. Zero credibility anyway."
4,Ain't like the old one but still good!,"I've been a big fan of this movie since it came out. In High School we thought it was ""the"" greatest car chase flick. Again, like the rest of you, I got older and started remembering things that I didn't want to forget and being able now to buy almost whatever I want, Amazon has brought a bunch of great memories to my house that I can share with my son. (He thinks I'm the bomb) This version is the same one you are expecting and I'm happy with it. The soundtrack has changed a little and the movie seems to be just a bit off. I can't figure it out. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie and can't wait to show my brother(s) when they get in town. It just seems ""different"". Oh course, Billy and the Cadillac are in this...""Catch you later Billy!"""
2,Gone in 60 seconds - original,"The acting was not the best, but the car chase more then made up for it."
5,Best car chase ever,A grindhouse classic with updated sound and clarified picture. Substantially superior to the Nicholas Cage remake.
3,WAY to long car chase,"the content of the movie such as the plot of stealing the cars, and they tricks they used to steal the cars is great.... the movie was really good, the only problem that i see with it is that the car chase was very very long, alot longer than it should have been. I mean yeah i know the car chase is a major part of the movie, but it could have been done in half the time and still have been as effective... i actually fell asleep half way through it... it was just way to long for me... i do reccomend this movie as a good watch- but if you dont have alot of time to sit through and extremely long car chase, then you shouldnt watch it... I have also seen the dvd version.... and the dvd has some pretty cool extras on it... if you like the vhs you should check out the dvd...."
3,the original GONE IN 60 Seconds,"ok, I bought it for my boyfriend coz he has a 2007 Black Mustang GT and all he ever talked about was the 1974 version of GONE IN 60 SECONDS! So, I got and the movie was ok, but the out takes and extra footage on the movie was even better! He was thrilled to have everything on the DVD and has watched it countless times! For him, it was a great investment! For me, its a great babysitter to keep him out from under my feet! :-)"
5,The Original,"It was a few years after watching the remake of Gone in 60 Seconds before I learned that it was even a remake at all. Watching the original was pretty cool because they had similar scenes. What was even better though was the chase scene with Eleanor, a Mustang Mach I, and it lasted waaaay longer than the one with Nic Cage. If you love cars, then you have to have this movie"
1,"the movie is great, but the dvd STINKS","This is one of the all-time greatest car movies every made. the chase scenes are spectacular. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the plot plausible and intriguing.HOWEVER, the dvd RUINED this movie. Although the bonus features are great, they cheaped out and didn't include the original score. Instead of the funky 70s music that totally fit the mood (stuff) that I could have whipped up on my home pc in about 10 minutes.The missing songs and score totally ruined this otherwise terrific movie. You also get to see Halicki's widow insert herself all throughout the special features to the point of nausea. She even credits her own PARENTS with the making of the dvd! WTF???"
4,what happened to the music,"The music score was my only disapointment, I was really looking forward to hearing some of those corney old 70's songs. I hated the elivator type background music, that replaced those old songs and background sounds. The picture quality has been greatly improved. the film just doesn't have the feal of the original. But it is still good, I am just hard to please."
5,Still The King of car chase movies,"Still the king of car chase movies. See Eleanor fly through the streets of Long Beach,Carson, and Wilmington."
4,Gone in Sixty Seconds (original),I thought that this movie was really good. The forty minute car chase in it was really funny.
2,A total letdown.,"After all the hype I heard about the original Gone in 60 Seconds and it's car chases, I just decided to buy it. Needless to say I was disappointed. The film is very poorly made. No plot, bad acting, and poor directing. The first half of the film moves along at a snails pace and finally when the car chase begins, the chase itself is actully dull. I would only recommend for die hard car chase fans."
3,I actually liked this film despite Cage being in it.,"The cars are as exotic as Angelina Jolie. Not a bad flick (for a remake anyway). The action combined with humor is quite entertaining. It's too bad that they had to cast Mr. No-acting skills himself as the lead. I find it hard to beleive this guy won an oscar. I wonder how much his original name (COPPOLA) had anything to do with it?Despite all of this, this isn't a bad film. Nice casting too, except the obvious leading role mistake."
1,Gone in 60 seconds (1974 version),"After reading all the hype I went and bought this title and honestly, I hope I can sell it to some other chump. The other low rated reviews pretty much reflect my feelings about the movie. To sum it up boring, watching a bunch of average 70's junk cars run into each other, I don't get it? The Elanor chase scene should have been 10 minutes not 40. No other cars worth looking at get any screen time besides the Mustang. The Cannonball run movies were better than this and the newer movies like the remake of Gone in 60 and The Fast and the Furious while exaggerated are way more entertaining. Maybe it's nostalgia for other reviewers but PLEASE take my advice and RENT THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!"
1,Decided never to watch it ever again in under 0.60 second's,"This movie is terrible. It reminded me of the bad acting you see in a porno movie, I kept expecting the twangy music to start playing and people to start striiping off and getting it on! Thats how great there acting is!I suppose if your a car lover, which im not, then this movie would be of intrest, but to me, it was a porno movie without any nudity! It was shockingly bad acting! The remake might have had better actors and a plot, but even that one didnt intrest me.If your into cars and like to see them on screen going fast? then youll probably love the movie, if your like me and thats not your fancey, then youll agree with this."
2,What a Mustang!,"Big series of unreal crashes, a Mustang that withstands anything, and a lousy theme."
1,Gone in 60 Seconds,Unfortunately I have not seen the movie. I ordered the wrong version. I wanted the one with Nicolas Cage.
4,One of a kind!,"I have loved this moving since it first came out in the theater. There is a similar one he did, called ""The Junkman"" which is also great, featuring rare '70's CHP Camaros (the real ones!) Can't find ""Deadline Auto Theft"" anywhrere!!"
5,Best most accurate car chase ever filmed,This movie is the defines what a car chase should be. It has the most realistic car chase and longest car chase ever filmed.
5,Best Car Chase Movie ever Made,I watched this movie 52 times 21 times with in the first Year it was out. And never got tired of it my wife raise so much cain about she called it an addiction. Now I wait til she leaves. I have wore out my Tape and need a new one I sure hope Amazon.com can come up with one I'm Ready to buy.
3,The chase scene if over 30 minutes long,The best part of this movie by far is the chase scene. It must be the longest ever made.
3,Legend has it...,"...that this movie's 40-minute car-chase finale, which wrecks something like 96 cars, was conceived, choreographed, and filmed before anyone thought of a plot for the rest of the movie. Whether or not this is true, the point should be obvious--the car chase outweighed any other reason to see the movie. That said, the car chase was one of the best ever captured on film. As other reviewers wrote here, a must for fans of old cars."
4,"Great movie, terrible music","I love this movie but this version include a music in the chase. The best version is the original version because the music is over the engine sounds and crashes. One advice, if you have a ""home theather"" just play with the ""speakers options"" or ""unplugged"" the speakers of the music and you could listen and enjoy the original sound version."
3,Hold on until the end,"This movie is definitely dated and has none of the glamour or detail of the more recent remake staring Nicholas Cage. This movie does not focus as much on each of the cars that are stolen and you will see a warehouse full of cars and wonder how most of them got there.However, as a period piece it is not only watchable, but the chase scene at the end of the movie, which is allegedly 40 minutes long, is in itself well worth hanging on for. While it makes the chase scene in Bullit seem like a big budget undertaking, the gritty realism and 40 minute thrill ride define the movie."
4,THE BEST OF THE KINGSMEN,"THE KINGSMEN WERE NOT ONLY A HITWITH THEIR SMASH SINGLE-'LOUIELOUIE,' BUT CAN PERFORM OTHERARTIST'S SONGS EQUALLY WELL.THIS CD RANKS AMONGEST MY FAVORITEROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. A DEFINITETOE TAPPER."
1,sucked,THIS IS A P.O.S. i should've put my money into an iPOD..at least they're more dependable. the USB cord didn't work with the music player and the manual was the worst thing ever!!!it didn't help me at all with what i was trying to do. DONT BUY THIS MUSIC PLAYER!! if u see this warning in time dont buy it. buying an iPOD in person is better than goin thru this B.S. to contact seller. if it is too late..good luck
2,"Bland, but one or two decent tracks","I found this CD in a used bin and bought it just for fun and because the name was catchy. It is pretty clear that the artist is not a professional musician, nor are the lyrics memorable. Her voice is best on the softer tracks, namely This Morning and Third Day, but she comes off as forced and untrained in most of the others. She is a bit overpowered by her studio musicians' accompanyment. She seems to be aiming for every genere in hopes that a producer, be it rock, country, or pop, will like what they hear. This is not a great album as the other posts here would suggest, but a ok effort by someone who seems to have recorded one and only one album. I give it two stars for two decent songs."
1,Imation Lock software just ruins it.,"Aside from it being larger than I had anticipated, the actual USB drive is not attached to the keychain or the unit. So the small USB drive inside this contraption is susceptible to falling out.However, what prompted me to write this review is the horrible proprietary software on the USB drive itself (Imation Lock) that creates a public and private portion of the drive. One you can password protect, and the other you don't. I didn't need this or want it. I was hoping to use True Crypt. But to remove Imation Lock proved almost impossible. The Imation website and the user manual for Imation Lock are completely and totally unhelpful. This will be the last time I purchase a product from their company."
3,"It works, but it ain't quick.","Convenient size, nice little rubber case. Reads are nice and quick but writes were fairly slow. That said, it worked fine for carrying files around and for running PortableApps stuff."
5,"Protected, and massive storage","I owned the 1GB version of this for a long time and purchased the 4GB version for my partner. He, like I, has been thrilled with the Caribeener clip as we both keep it on our key rings at all times now. So there's never a time when we are without the ability to store files.I keep my passwords on mine, so no matter where I am, I have access to them. (It is encrypted.) But something like PortableApps will make this even more useful.No downsides that I've found."
5,HeY There !!!,HI. i am the bratz #1 fan.i have every bratz doll that anyone could want.i am a spoiled bratz that loves the bratzdolls.my bratz really love me and i love my bratz
5,WOW WoW WOW!,"THIS IS THE MOST AUSOMEIST TOY ON THE EARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You should DEFINETLY get this for you or your child/sibling. I am lost of words, it is so cool! YOU NEED THIS! I NEED THIS.KRISTEN"
4,Great for Barbies too!,"I found this at a thrift store for $1.90. It has the bar, one floatie, the stage and the pool itself. No accessories came with it, but we are loving it! The pool doesn't stink or anything, but looks as though it has had water in it (which is what we got it for). My little 4 year old girl can put at least three Barbies in it (as we don't have any Bratz). Very sturdy, big and wonderful. The basics is what we got and what is great about this pool! Even if you bought new and lost accessories, it is awesome and I would have spent $25 easily for this.Great pool for any doll!"
4,Great history lesson,"Stagg was one of the great innovators of the game who rarely gets his due that is shares with ND Rockne, Yost of MI and Zuppke of Illinois. He was as clever off the field as on the field. He invented recruiting, and questionable tactics employed by athletic departments. The University took a principles stand against sacrificing their academic integrity in order to be competitive."
1,Doesn't work,"Worthless pump. Does hard to start, hard to keep going, at the price I expected much more than something I could have made myself."
4,"Short, but cool.","This was a very fun VHS to watch. The action only last one hour, but it is fun to reflect back during that time at some fun fun wrestling. The matches on this video are nothing to go crazy for, but the characters in the WWF at the time are awesome! Definately worth the dollar!"
2,poor design,"Shaver works fine, but does not hold charge well at all. Pop-up trimmer does not lock in place and constantly folds back up while trimming sideburns, etc. This is extremely annoying and could have easily been designed better."
3,Book Title,"First off I am disappointed with Amazon for allowing this book to be available to the public. I didnt realize a diary written between 1955 and 1960 was 100 years ago... I guess my parents arent really in their 50s if they were born in that time frame. Why does the book covers (front and back) both say 50th anniversary, but the title on Amazon's describtion says 100th? A buy wanted the book but when I told her about the miss-print she no longed wanted the book.... THANKS!"
5,Personal,"I read Carolina. This is a book about her real life, touching because personal, much more real than writers that only do demagogy, like Machado de Assis and Jorge Amado."
2,"Ultimately, a dull and monotonous story.....","told with anger to be sure, but there is curiously little insight into the dynamics of Brazilian life. Vivid atmosphere and hopelessness are captured on every page, but the account proves that social history must always remain on the outskirts of historical study. The book is a quick read, but remarkably uneventful."
4,Must read!,"Beautifully written. There is limited editing so you can get the the honest feel that Carolina Maria de Jesus intended. You envision her days from start to end, going through those rough days with her. An honest glimpse in to the slums of Brazil that are often times hidden."
2,Never delivered,"I am a big fan of Curve magazine, and I am trying to still be one. However, I subscribed to the magazine months ago. Yet I have yet to receive anything. I've been e-mailing with people at the magazine for an extended period of time, being told I would get my first magazine soon, and after a while I asked for my money back. Now I keep being told I will have my return in the mail soon. Several e-mails have said this now. 5 months of this now.It's most likely nothing against the magazine, which is why I'm giving it two stars. It's the subscribers that are having an issue.I'd say spend a little more money and buy it each time it comes out at Border's."
1,Curve Deaf Lesbians,Are there any stories about Deaf/Hard of Hearing Lesbians? Please give me sample. Thanks.
4,Curve review,"I'm a recent subsciber, but I think that Curve is a must need for every lesbian. I'm a teen whos just now comeing out, so this magizine has helped me view the lesbian world and feel comfortable with my self. It helped show me the culture behind being a lesbian rather then a bunch of wild lesbain sex which is often the way socitey portrays lesbains. It is definatly a must have."
3,"Way TOO MUCH ""L Word""","Yes, like every other dyke in America I watch The L Word. But too much of the content of the magazine is about the show and it's actors: straight and lesbian. Give us a break, there are too many smart,strong,talented lesbians that would be of interest to focus on one TV series."
3,Lacking women of color......,"Overall Curve is a great magazine and i've been reading it for 5 years now. Only problem I have with it is, it does not really represent the african american lesbian, if it did, I would then, subscribe to it."
2,Poor salesmanship,Ordered the magazine on June 19th and it's going on 10 weeks with no word about getting the first issue! Lack of courtesy on the merchant for not keeping me updated about the product. wish I could say more about the product itself.-Ingrid
5,Best fruit cake ever,"Over the years, I've tried several fruit cake brands in several price ranges and Claxton is by far the best quality cake I've tried. I also felt the price was more than fair."
4,Truth Like Fire,"I have read many books by authors discussing the truth of our direct experience of reality. Who are we? What exactly is going on here in this life? This collection of essays by Todd Vickers, as unpollished and at times awkwardly written as it is, was a breeze of fresh air to me. Amongst all the sanitized written accounts of ""self-realized"" beings, here is a book that feels like a personal embrace: full of honesty, insight, affection, and a touch of bad breath and body odor. Reading this book, as well as ""The Paradox of Self Realization"", taught me something new about living in honesty, and I experienced powerful pointers to deepest being."
5,I can't get enough of this stuff.,"It smells so good and feels so good on my body. I bought it in Canada and couldn't find it in the little town where I lived, so on my next trip to Canada I loaded up on it."
4,Liked it about,"Great color, size, love Kermit and perfect for the whole family. Can be done quickly and great for learning about puzzles. Good for children and adult of all ages"
2,Not built well,THe product is inferior to the other Remington shavers that I have used. The specific flaw is with the head assembly which is not dirable and broke right away. The good news is that Remington stands behind their product if you call them directly.
3,Great quality--but runs way too big!!,"As above--I wish I could wear these,but they run too wide in both sizes I could wear!!---They are extremely well built,and if your foot is wide--you would probably love them!!"
5,"Beggin' yer pardon, m'Lord, but....","....when did Brian Townsend change his name to Michael Jackson? Is it possible that ""magellan359"" got a wee bit off course from one wee dram too many? Other than that, it's an ok review except for the fact that it's more about him than about the book, not what one would expect from one of Amazon's ""top"" reviewers. Oh, well..."
2,Won't last long!,I purchased this product based on the good reviews on Amazon's site. I installed the cartridge on the same day as I received it. The prints are fine for about 15 pages then the ink appears smearing and feathering. It lasts for another 10 pages then completely out of ink! The cost of printing 25 pages of document for seven dollars and some is way too expensive.
1,Not DOA but....,worked fine when originally installed but dead 2 weeks later. the last recycled cartridge I had worked great for quite some time but I couldnt remember where I bought it. This one is probably not out of ink but clogged after sitting idle for 2 weeks. tried cleaning via print properties but still not printing anything legible.
3,Ink,"We received the product very quickly which was excellent. At first we had difficulty getting it to print however after taking the cartridge in and out a few times we were able to print. However, we have found that sometimes when it prints some of the sentences do not come out clearly and we have to take the cartridge out and shake it. Usually after that it seems to print clearly. The ink comes out very dark which is good but for some reason it does not print every word clearly unless you shake it."
1,Did not work,"This ""compatable"" product did not work, I ordered brand name product to replace this and my printer now works fine."
3,It works.,I did not get as many pages as I expected but for the money it was a good deal. I will buy again!
2,"Low price, but ...","This is a follow up review to my October, 2011 purchase of three cartridges. One arrived leaking and it was promptly replaced. I have just finished using up the last one. All three exhibited an annoying problem. They do not remain ""ready to print"" while in the printer. The page would be missing the first few lines, then start to get ink, and finally have full coverage for the bottom portion of the page. I learned that I'd have to remove the cartridge and swipe the printing surface with paper or similar until I got a full blob of ink and reinstall it then hit ""print"" to get ink to flow. I can't tell you how many ruined pages I have had. I usually have a gap of time between print jobs. I'd have to ""prime"" the cartridge each time. This is not worth it to me. I'm going back to the name brand cartridge."
2,Don't waste your money on this junk,"Well, to start with, it's a good thing that these cartridges come in a sealed package as one of the four was leaking when it arrived. The one that I installed worked for a couple of days before it started to clog up. Using the printer's nozzle clean function would not fix the problem. Neither does soaking the heads. Save your money and buy the Lexmark cartridges and just keep refilling them until they die."
1,You get what you pay for,"The first cartridge I recd. arrived broken w ink leaking inside the packaging. It was inadequet for the item shipped. The item was replaced by the vendor w/o any problems and arrived intact. (same packaging,lucky). Initially, the cartridge worked well. But when not used for a time (3-4 days) the print quality deteriorated dramatically. My office is cold (65 F) so I warmed up the cartridge thinking it would improve the print quality. It did. However, over time (2 wks.) this ""fix"" didn't work anymore. I suspect the cartridge would work well in a warm office where the printer was used daily.OBTW, the ""print head clean"" function does not work with the cartridge. In fact, executing it, locks up the computer and requires task mgr. to restore control.I guess I'll be looking for another vendor. Any recommendations?"
4,Great Concert,If you missed out on the femme fatale tour ? Everything is there on this dvd execpt the 2 songs.He about to lose me and burning out but can't complain I still enjoyed it.minus 1 star for that and having ninki manaj ruined till the world ends in closing for the concert.But the bonus remix cd is cool. Get that edition while you can.
5,Exceeds Any and All Expectations,"I received my copy in the mail today via the UPS postal service. I had already had the privilege of viewing the show on EPIX the night of the premiere and I was blown away. People can say what they will about Britney Spears, what they claim she is and what she isn't, but there is no doubt the woman is the poster girl for pop music, a transcending phenomenon for all generations. To keep it short and simple, I will say that the Femme Fatale Tour DVD is nothing short of spectacular. You don't have to be a fan per say, but if you are someone looking for an amazing display of talent and pop music perfection, this DVD is for you! You will NOT be disappointed!"
2,Britney watch a little bit of Gaga!,"I have seen at the same time both Lady Gaga's Monster Ball and this Femme Fatale. Britney's performance and intensity looks so poor when compared with Lady Gaga. She should play live, and not use recorded voice. When she dances it feels like a robot she should put more emotion. All in all, the songs are good, but I can't find the spirit of this show."
3,horrible recap of an amazing show,"I want to start by saying that I saw this show live in NJ and it was AMAZING. I am a huge Britney fan but I was nervous about the show because I didn't want to think that I had spent that much money to hear the woman lip sync. I was SO pleasantly surprised that for over 60% of the concert you could hear her way louder than the backtrack. Unfortunatly, people at EPIX apparently wanted to add fuel to the criticisms about her not singing live by releasing a DVD that was COMPLETELY dubbed over by the Femme Fatale CD vocals. So disappointing. If you want to see what the Femme Fatale Tour was really like, GO TO YOUTUBE! This DVD blows."
4,Great concert but it sounds like it is dubbed,"Just like everyone else said, the concert is great and Britney looks awesome but she sounds like she was dubbed. You can't hear her voice as you would expect to hear her in a live concert. But overall, it is a great concert. I just wish her voice sounded live."
3,If it was her first concert it would've been good,"Sadly instead of growing as an artist at least concert wise this went backwards. She isn't a train wreck but is nowhere near the performer/dancer she once was. I think she can be, but she has to find herself again too many ppl are controlling her. She looked uncomfortable performing some of the moves in ""if u seek amy."" Even the costumes felt a little cheesy; it's sad idk who's running the show but it's not going to last... Circus would've been a better DVD to put out.Britney seriously needs to take a year to think about what she wants out of life and to get her crap together. Whether it's being with her family or being worthy of being a top entertainer she can do it she just needs to find a direction and get some standards. She owes it to herself and I'd hate to say it but she's going to lose fans if she doesn't raise the bar a little higher. I'll continue to be a fan, but it's sad to watch wasted potential."
1,Not Worth Renting,"What a train wreck. I don't understand the myriad of good reviews! BS obviously screwed herself up so much she has to fill the stage with talented dancers, flashing lights and ridiculous props to distract you from the lip-synching and stiff dancing.While I understand she's older and cannot move the way she used to, she dances worse than Madonna, but Madonna is effing 50-something! So I don't buy the age excuse. I'm thinking she's on medication for Bipolar Disorder making her movements stiff and uncoordinated looking. Could I do what she does? Nope, but damn sure, if I was getting paid untold amounts of money, I'd be like Madonna rocking it like nobody's business.I felt bad for fans that paid outrageous ticket prices. Maybe now is the time for BS to try acting. Thank Goddess this was on Netflix and I didn't buy it."
1,Hand-Dancing and Mumbling lyrics,"Throughout the show Britney keeps doing the hand-dance if you know what I mean, the choreography is the same with everysong (the X-cross hand, the butterfly-ear hand, the inviting hand, etc.) I can barely hear what she is singing, all I can hear is the beat and the bass. So basically, every song performance is same same and it makes me fall asleep. She is gorgeous and fit and I have so much respect for her but this is too painful to watch. And did I even mention some of the remixes are terrible.I think Britney should have another choreographer and another Record Title, I mean whoever recorded and designed and released this DVD is so bad, the cover itself looks cheap and seems like they must have rushed to release it."
3,Depends -- What are YOU looking for in a tour DVD?,"Q: What happens when you put a pre-recorded .MP3 over the sound of someone who is dancing minimally enough to allow real singing?A: You make someone who is not doing HEAVY dancing, look like they're lip-syncing, and it's just kind of weird-looking.THE AUDIENCE and LIVE VOCALS are part of the ""concert experience"" for me -- and both AUDIENCE and LIVE VOCALS were present at this show in Canada, but in post-production, the full unedited CD track was edited in over almost all of it.All this DVD did was make me kinda ticked off I didn't buy a ticket to the real show...I get why it was done; the audience IS loud, they ARE pushing a new album. Still can't watch again, even though the performances were really good.If you just want to see what Britney looks like now & what her new songs sound like & the themes chosen for the production. This will be great for you!"
1,She's not Britney that we know anymore,"I'm so disappointed. I'm a fan of her since Baby one more time. In this DVD u can easily see she can't move anymore. We all know that she can't sing live but now she can't even dance too. So, what else she can do? The true Britney is gone since before Gimme more but this is worse. I'm buying this for my collection but i finally know that is just a trash."
5,This show is perfect!,"Sorry for my bad english, I'm from Germany and review this DVD because I was at the concert in Cologne, on October 18th.It was the first concert in my life - and I will never forget it. Some songs are sung live. The other songs had a great show with good movements and fireworks effects.My favorit song was definitely ""I Wanna Go"", because it has been through the whole crowd.Every time again! Love it!"
5,PERFECTNEY!!!!,"This show was amazing and of course Britney was phenomenal!!! I am so happy this is out on DVD!!! Wish I would have known it was on Amazon, could have gotten free OVERNIGHT shipping vs. getting it directly from Britney.com!!! Either way I am getting my copy so BOOYA!!!!"
3,Poor video quality,"The video quality is like seeing a dvd instead a blu-ray, I expected much more.I think that Britney do the best she can at the moment, i've seen her live and it was almost lipsync ......this bluray sounds entire lipsynced."
1,rubbish,"It was absolutely draining to watch from the beginning to end. My roomate is an extreme fanboy who made me watch this online with him.. utter mess.. the visuals where uninspiring, the voice/audio (or lack of) is all messed up.. its an utter mess.. stay away. the only people who will find this even ably tolerable are only the dellusional fanboys who worship this girl simply because of their nostalgic likings to her. stay away.. ahhh!"
1,Its Britney bitch,"It's sad to know that persons like this who doesn't have a voice at all and can't move obtain such honored award like Michael Jackson VMA...She's absolutely useless...How she dare to treat her fans like that - with no voice, no moves and no attitude?!Such a shame!"
1,terrible. Fake and lip-synced,"I honestly don't know how this artist is still around. She lip-syncs the whole thing and if it isn't what you hear on the CD, then it was pre-recorded.I wonder what she really sounds like live. Probably why she can't cause her voice is terrible.A complete waste of your money. Unless you want to watch an artist pretend to sing while dancing half-assed. Absolutely no talent. It should be 0 stars."
1,NO Thanx!,"Alot Of editing went into this Show to make her look Interesting. Originally Broadcast on EPIX CH, Now released on Dvd, It has the excitement of a High School Talent Show. She was once a good dancer but Now she always seems lost on stage with NO stage presence. Whatever Medication she's on... She needs to quit. Furthermore The Entire concert is Lip Synched. Why waste money when you can just listen to the record???Not worth the money. Unless you're still in High School"
5,It's Britney Bitch!!!,"Great concert, sadly she changes a lot of performances in the SouthAmerican Tour, she's a queen and her music awesome!!!"
2,Gawd She's Terrible,"She's better saved for produced videos with a lot of CG and professional dancers intercut.Live, she barely moves, lip syncs (of course) and needs help even stepping down from a 2 step staircase!She'd occasionally wave her arms and make some attempts at a dance move here or there, but there were no moments where you thought she was accomplishing more than any teenage girl dancing in her bedroom mirror."
2,"Should Be Called ""The Tragedy Tour""","I used to love Britney and her performances but COME ON, this tour and DVD are blatant ""grab-the-money-and-go"" clunkers. She barely seems interested at all and seems to hand-dance in slow motion. She used to be a powerhouse performer (even if she never actually sang) but gone are the wicked-hot dance moves and unshakable confidence. She barely moves her lower body and is in pretty bad shape. The entire production looks cheap, from the costumes to her jacked-up hair extensions. Sad to see a former superstar just going through the motions (barely) so she can make some more money. I'm pretty much a former Britney fan at this point."
2,This is the best Britney can do?,"I bought this for a BIG Britney Fan who attended this concert recently. Her problem wasn't so much with the dvd but with Britney's performance. She remarked that Britney seemed to be walking through the show and how little Britney put into the performance when compared to her back-up dancers. If you put out a concert dvd, you want to make sure that it's the artist's best performance. Unfortunately, this isin't it."
2,They covered her live vocals...why??,"I'm one of the rare people that is giving this a low score not because of bitter dislike for Britney, because I'm quite the opposite and have every disc and have seen many of her shows. This rating is specifically for the production value of the DVD/Blu-Ray release of the Femme Fatale concert. If you saw this concert in person, then you'd know that she actually sang a hefty portion of the show live, which is what fans have been asking for (especially after she lip synced the entire Circus concert). However, on this DVD/Blu-Ray, when she does sing live, you can only faintly hear the actual vocals underneath pre-recorded tracks that were NOT heard at the actual concert (even the YouTube clips will prove this). Why the producers of the disc would choose to cover her live vocals and continue to feed the ""Britney lip syncs because she can't sing"" myth is beyond me."
3,Coming from a true Britney fan...,"I saw the show back on June 28 in Portland, and I LOVED IT. However, this DVD is Britney's worst. Her dancers upstage her, and that's not right. I don't like the job Epix has done with the audio, visual, and whatnot. Britney Spears is BRITNEY SPEARS. Come on? You would expect more out of her... I bought this because I am a true fan and love all her work. You decide to buy it or not. A plus is the menu. It's basic, but it's nice. It plays the instumental to her hit I Wanna Go and shows small video clips throughout the show. I don't think you would be wrong to buy this but understand you get what you pay for and Epix sucks.Dear Britney, next time you film one of your shows DO NOT let them dub your live vocals and stick to the pros [Shotime, HBO, and others. NEVER EPIX.]"
2,Extremely disappointing,"I tried to give this DVD a chance. I really did. But it's just BAD. Poor lip-syncing, weak dancing (compared to what Spears demonstrated in the early years of her career), and a general lack of personality plague what should have been an amazing concert. The problem is not with the concert - the production is fantastic and the sets look really cool. The problem is Britney. It doesn't seem like her heart is in this. I expected a lot more from a Britney Spears concert DVD and I'm very disappointed that her record label would put something this mediocre out on the market."
1,lip sync all the time,i love britney spears. but i think she should sing live. it is embarrassing to see an artist lip sync all the time over her concert.
3,Why rip us off,I only give it 3 stars why did they cut off songs like Burning Up and He About To Lose Me I hate when they do this to concerts. not good at all
2,Terrible Video Quality,The Video Quality is very pixelated and blurry. I checked my internet connection and it is working fine. I tried watching another video and it looks fine. I have no idea what is going on but this sucks.
5,the best bluray disc I ever bought!,"If you love Britney as much as I do, get this bluray!!! you won't regret it. she's back better than ever!! it's worth every pennie I spent! fast shipping and great packaging."
4,A Cute Toy,"My 6 year old daughter got this for Christmas this year and really likes it. She's really not into Barbie's at all so she doesn't play with the doll much, but she loves the x ray machine and the little cards that you put in it. It's a fun toy that doesn't have a lot of tiny pieces to get lost. The xray cards store nicely in the back of the xray machine. The only problem we're having with the toy is that the shoes don't stay on Barbie's feel very well. They seem a little loose and my daughter gets frustrated with that."
4,Ranger down,"Hi,I really like the power rangers and all the shows I just wish that they would have all the power rangers shows on dvd not just bites like they do with each new season.From mighty morphin to now power rangers mystic force I do hope they will do them soon I still will watch the shows and record them too.candy"
3,Good reference even though not up to date,"I recently borrowed this book from the library. It is stock full of information, vitamins, minerals, herbs, symptoms, a little of everything. I especially liked the full explaination of vitamins and their attributes. The only thing bad about this book is that it isn't up to date with all the new herbs out on the market or new diseases and afflictions."
2,A little Dated,The book was very soiled and looked nasty. The content was dated. Not really worth the time and trouble and cost.
4,Audio-,This language learning tool is accompanied by an Audio tape that make is more convient and easy to follow. This addition is for the student whose really interested in learning English. I strongly recommend it!
2,Bad Girls A Dated B Flick,"On my quest to see everything famed B movie actress Brinke Stevens has been in, I bought a copy of Bad Girls From Mars.Bad Girls stars Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls' Edy Williams and Jay Richardson from multiple other Brinke Stevens films.Starting off on the set of a movie (a campy b movie about beautiful female aliens trying to take over the earth) it looks good. The first scene seems so funny that I thought I was in for a treat. Unfortunately that was it as the director of the movie shouts out 'CUT' and the movie stars revolving around the cast and crew that are making this film.The movie turns into a serial killer movie about the lead actresses. All of them seem to be getting murdered. Enter in Edy Williams as the new actress.Some mild who dunnit, lots of Edy Williams disrobing and that's about it for this movie."
3,A spoof of the genre,"The movie title is the title of the grade Z Sci-fi-sex comedy that a zany film production company is making. It is sort of campy, but has lots of snappy sight and dialog gags inserted by a smart script writer. The plot is rather thin--a Freddy-type menace is stalking and killing members of the film crew--wearing an Army surplus cold weather mask, yet. The VHS version is certainly worth the...cost, and because it spoofs many other films (you have to be listening and watching closely to catch the subtle references and gags), it holds your attention in a campy way. There is the requisite T&A, tho I was a bit put off by the pumped up female lead. The movie is tongue in cheek, and a lot of the gags could have been done better, but is good enough for yucks and laughs when watching it with company with nothing better to do."
2,Can you say fast-forward?,"A failed spoof on Sci-Fi genre luckily, this is a movie about how to make movies. It is designed to teach you how to keep your actresses from losing their heads, or from losing any other appendages.The movie's main thrust seems to be concentrated on upper torso frontal extensions (several pair). While observing this movie, I learned about the fast forward button. And suggest you do the same."
3,"Borrow, don't buy","This is one of those books that is neat to look at, but just not worth adding to your library. If you've exhausted the Monster Manual and desperately need new creatures to fight, then you might want to look at this. It does contain a relatively good range of creatures, in terms of difficulty and interesting aspects, including even more dragons (can't ever have too many of those, can we?). It's also well illustrated, as is the norm for such things. However, this book just isn't worth paying for. It isn't even hardcover, but it costs as much as the Monster Manual, which also has about 5 times the monsters. So, if you think you'll need it, borrow it from someone else or find it at a bookstore and library. Look up what you want, jot down a few stats, and you're all set. Just don't pay for it."
1,Good book but the price kills it's value.,This really is a good book. Lots of new monsters to add flavour to a campaign. Anything that adds to the campaign is a good thing. But for this product the cost is very high. Roleplaying books have always been expenisve. But this one pushes it too far. I walked away from D&D over 10 years ago. The only thing that has got me excited again was when I picked up the players guide and saw the content and price. I bought it and the DM's guide and I am certainly going to buy more. I am VERY excited about the new look and the new direction the game is taking.But this one book leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. If you don't have it buy the Monster manual instead.
4,PRETTY GOOD,this book covers mnay cool monsters that can be used in any campain. Its monsters are also very creative. But the price if a little to much. It is overall worth it.
2,not worth it if you have the Monsters Manual,"and if you don't then still get MM... this book has good monsters and nice art works, but its not that essential, the price is even more than the MM, and its merely 100 pages and a paperback! the monsters here are kinda rare and strange, so if you are a DM, just use the MM monsters cuz its more known and is adaptable to the Forgotten Realms setting...even if its cheap, I would give it 2.5 - 3 stars... better get Magic of Faerun or Lords of Darkness instead!"
2,Not enough to warrant the cost,"Anyone who is anyone enjoys the mystique and familiarity of the Forgotten Realms. So when any material labeled as such comes out of course we are all drawn into learning more about this fascinating realm. Well do not be spell bound by this product. Yes it does add more monsters for your gaming pleasure, but not enough real monsters to be worth it. Many of the latest products presented recently by Wizards of the Coast are solid, that is why I was very dissapointed by this one. This book was truly written for nothing more than to suck more cash from the gamer. Really should have a hardback to make it more worthwhile."
3,Interesting,WOTC's new Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faerun is a mix of the old and the new. Classic realms monters are represented in a fresh new form as well as some new never before seen entries. Each monster has a entry for a standard campagin as well as for the Forgotten Realms. The little bit of history gives the book flavor. But there seems to be some listings missing. Why is there a entry for a dwarf but not an elf? And where is the Dracolich? It can be difficult at times to find information on a monster because of the mulitpage listings. But all in all it can breath fresh air into a stale game. Now only if the Forgotten Realms Campaign Sourcebook itself was out. Then we could enjoy this product to its fullest.
4,Monster Mania,"An excellent book with a nice mix of monsters... ranging from creatures that were forgotten in the 3e Monster Manual, and adding a few more surprises.Want to fight a new dragon? Fang? Song? Shadow?Great templates also. And check out the monster that takes the round to coup-de-grace someone in combat to eat their heart. Now THERE'S a monster for you."
4,Changes,"Like everything in 3rd edition, be ready for big time changes. One of my biggest surprises was what they did to dragons of all types. Basically the dragon's magical powers are now much more limited than they had been in 2nd edition, including getting rid of their polymorph abilities; and their spell-casting abilities have been restricted...Basically the moral of the story is if you're going to play 3rd edition, be sure you fully check over the new descriptions of the monsters. They may have totally different powers, or they may be more or less powerful. Something you thought was foolproof against certain monsters now may do nothing."
3,Same old stuff in the 3ed way...,"An expansion on the Monster Manual (MM), the Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faerun (MC) delivers on some unique and some old monsters that spice up your game.From Shadow Dragons to outsiders (alternate-planar beings) that are semi-elemental, the MC is a good way to add monsters that will spice up any game. Each of them is done in the same format as in the MM and allows for a DM's own formatting. The book also discusses some of the aspects of the different regional characteristics of some of the alternate races, such as dwarves.Some of the nice additions are Shadow Dragons, Genasi, Tieflings, Good Lichs, more Were forms, and more types of Beholder.If you are looking for the best books for 3ed., get them in this order: Monster Manual, Creature Collection (from Sword & Sorcery, which is compatible with 3ed. D&D), and then this book."
3,I hope Greenwood wasn't paid by the monster...,"Let me begin by saying that I have never been a fan of the D&D 'canned' worlds... especially the I-wish-they-would-be Forgotten Realms.The monsters on the other hand have always been intriguing and have added much flavor to my campaign.This version of the latest set of Faerun monsters is no exception. The beasts of Malar, Neothilid (from the marvelous Mind Flayers book), Elemental and Non-human Plane-touched and a variety of Liches all happily add to my excitement.There are a great many opportunities for the DM to go wild with this book and if they are running an FR campaign I am sure this will be essential to game play... the book is gorgeous to look at and will compliment any gaming table.Unfortunately the supplement is NOT (like so many of the new products from WOTC) priced to sell. The requested price is ludicrous in light of the size of the document offered..."
3,"An essential for Realms fans, but others may wish to pass...","I recommend this as 4 stars to Realms users, but only 2 stars to anyone else. The critters are important for all Realms DMs to have access to. Vicious arch enemy races abound in this book. A few good ones could be ported out of the Realms to other worlds, but several of these beasties are pretty silly. You may feel you did not quite get the value you were looking for... Especially when you realize how much you just paid for a SOFT COVER reference book!!! And one with a shortage of monsters to boot... many less than the Monster Manual, but at a higher price. Happy hunting!"
3,Still Clumsy,"I like the 3rd Edition System, and The Realms are my fav. setting.I don't like the format of the new Monster Manuals, The dispersed entry locations on pages are clusmy to find like the hard bound. I like to flip and find by heading (geuss I'm old school).I do like some of the new monsters (Well new to me... Like the Drow demon cross thing...)"
3,How many monsters for this price??,"I can't really say for sure, but this book seems to be woefully overpriced for the stuff they ""present.""Other than standard FR fare (Gensai and such), and some new Dragons, the rest seems to be a mix of ""Cool"" to ""What the heck were they thinking?""Seems only the ""Kitties"" (Spectral Panther, Wemic, and Quaggoth) are worth to add, but the rest (Firenewt?? WTF??) are bland or don't add really nothing new to the field.A suplliment that is best left on the store shelf...but, that's my opinion, I could be wrong..."
1,Useless for me - Not compatable with our camera,"This product should be called ""Canon"" Double Layer discs. The fine print finally tells you that, but I didn't see it until I received the product. It should be one of the first things in the description and should be visable on the packaging. Be careful!"
4,Not Only Barbecue,"This is a welcome addition to a promising series, although it is slightly misleading, due probably to the nature of the series. It is only about half to two-thirds about barbecue, although within that are some really terrific and far-ranging essays. The balance is about other Southern foodways, including boiled peanuts (as a previous reviewer noted)and boudin, although any book on any subject is enhanced by Calvin Trillin's contribution. He HAS written on barbecue (indeed, his piece on Arthur Bryant's is a landmark), but the Cornbread Nation does not promise to be inclusive. It sho' nuff makes one hungry though!"
2,Lack of information,No to many examples using DHTML. Need to cover in more details the full features of the Server Objects that ASP offer. The CD with code examples is pretty empty.
3,"Very inconclusive, assumes too much access to web server","The authors assumed that all web designers have access to the web server machine, which in fact is usually not the case. I myself being the senior web designer at a fairly large company, do not have the access privileges to write to files outside the HTTP directory or CGI-BIN. The root of the web server is forbbiden to everyone except the System Administrators. Any request to change system files or upload data sources can take days to implement or even weeks. I also have my personal web site hosted by a seperate internet host provider. Which I have no access to load any of the DLL files from the book to test or use. I do have an ASP directory but almost all of the examples in the book call functions or objects from their DLL's. Therefore, I can only assume these functions work as stated in the book. I did find the general information useful as to how ASP page are implemented and the robust features ASP offers to developers."
2,"Publishers, read this","This book handles databases worse than any book I have ever read. It's examples are shoddy at best, and it's reliance on it's own .dll's which aren't where it says it will be annoy the hell out of the reader. The book is written at approximately the two year old reading level, so if you want to have your intelligence insulted, this is the book for you. In fairness I have yet to see a book better than this on ASP (a truly sad prospect indeed)."
2,Product not the same as pictured,Just as other reviewer stated the product shipped is not the same as pictured. The design is significantly simpler and cheaper than pictured. The picture also makes it look like it has a gloss or lacquer finish. The product shipped seams comparable with table top ones that are about 2/3 the price as of Oct 2012.
2,Product not the same as pictured,"The product I received is not the same as the one pictured. It is a much cheaper design, and does not look as nice."
4,Works Great,"I looked all over the Internet trying to find the right kind of wall mount for my Japanese swords that I picked up while on active duty. I purchased this one because it seemed like the perfect fit. I was surprised that it looks like a standard table stand with two small hooks on the back. I guess I could have just bought a table stand and put the hooks on myself, but in any case, it works perfectly."
4,ray stevens album,great album however the song all my trials has parts missing in the song.i have the album and a guitar solo and verse are missing.still a great album.
5,Turn Your Radio On-Misty-Ray Stevens,"I had this product before in Album format...I loved it so much, I wanted it on CD...Thank goodness for reprints to CD! Thank you!"
1,Rip Off,I ordered this item because I was lead to think it was a new album. Whatit is are songs from old albums and only about 5 of them. The entire CDwas about 10 minutes. I returned it because I thought it was not worthit and ended up paying shipping and handling both ways. My refund endedup being about one dollar. What a disappointment and loss of money.
4,Duplicate single in Digit-PAC Form,"This is Enya Amaratine Single With the same 3 tracks, 1) Amaratine, 2)The Comb of the Wind, and The Spaghetti Western. The only difference is that it is in digit-PAC form as oppose to a slim case, that most of her singles come in. As for the condition of the single it self,it is as stated. Hope this helps others to avoid duplicates in the libraries."
1,This book is a complete sham!,"To begin with, this guy uses a notorious article from ""The Onion"" as a source of information! ""The Onion"" is a satiricle site and their articles are satires. In other words -- COMPLETELY FALSE!Steven Dollins misquotes the books, Ms. Rowling and even twists facts about what characters say and do in the Potter series in order to *prove* Satanic agendas.If you want to know more about Harry Potter, READ THE BOOKS. These books are not spell books and do not contain any more magic than your typical Disney cartoon. They are great stories about a child coming of age and learning that good will always defeat evil and that loyalty and friendship go hand-in-hand.The book in question here, Mr. Dollins ignorant opus on the occultic messages of Harry Potter, is full of half-truths and outright lies and is not worth the paper on which it is printed. I really wish that I hadn't spent one penny on this garbage."
1,HA HA HA HA.,"I guess we should not be allowed to read or watch Lord Of The Rings of Star Wars, next. Sheesh.Well I'm a Christian, and I read this book and it was STUPID!!!!! This book is basically the same as the video, ""Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged"".The catch: Stephin Dollins goes ""HARRY POTTER! AND WITCHCRAFT! PURE WORK OF SATAN! AHHH! BURN!!!!!!"" and keeps on misquoting the books and movies, and Rowling her self. He often keeps misprononouncing names such as ""Rufius Haggard"", ""Voldemore"", and Diagnon Alley"" when it's really ""Rubius Hagrid"", ""Voldemort"", and ""Diagon Alley"" and he also spouts misinformation about Rowling like saying she's a satanist and other misinformation.Whoop-Tee-Do, Then! If you're gonna read more about HP, read the books and watch the movies. That's the only place you'll find ifo about him and his friends."
3,very good,"this person came right out of a satan worship who of all should know the sneaky ways of satan..and to those fellow christians who dont believe, do you know how man get into witchcraft after reading and reading harry potter? would you say oh whoooopy dee do about withcraft also?"
1,The Worst Kind of Propaganda,"This is a disgusting little book deceptively offering a seemingly simple and upbeat story. However, this book communicates an extreme hostility to intellectual thought, and it panders to people who seek simplistic and adolescent answers to complex human problems."
3,What a blast from the past.,"I was the bass player for SOG (pronounced Sawg), track #7. We had the pleasure of opening for Mortification in Tucson, AZ and Steve Rowe gave us the opportunity to submit our demo. He is still running strong in the Lord, and more so than ever after nearly dying, and then being miraculously restored to health by God. God bless you Mr. Rowe. My favorite tracks are the ones by Erase and Crimson Thorn."
5,I GOT THIS FOR ONE OF MY BUDDIES,I GOT THIS CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.THEN LOST IT SO I HAD TO GET A COPY OF IT FOR ME AND ONE OF THE GUYS THAT WAS ONE IT IN A BAND NAMED SOD.IT'S A GOOD COMPILATION OF CHRISTIAN METAL BANDS FROM 1997
1,Didn't work,I plugged it in and it didn't work. It may have been a defect from who I purchased it from. Maybe in the future ill purchase from someone more reliable.
1,Horrible HORRIBLE BUZZING NOISE,"Even with my Phantom powered audio interface the buzzing from the pickup was noticeable. It's not worth the money~!! Don't buy it, because it's cheaper, but purchase something that doesn't have many issues, even if it costs more, because in the end you'll end up spending less. I mean you get what you paid for, but this is ridiculous. The MSRP is around 100 bucks these P.O.S. I will purchase higher grade than this one and see if it makes less buzzing noise."
4,Informative,"I liked this book for the vast information presented within. Walvoord gives thorough Biblical Passages of prophecy regarding the future of the Nations, of Israel and Christ's Church. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Escatology as well as Biblical Theology in general."
1,this book is medical ageism/exterminate the weak,"Callahan's arguments for healthcare rationing based on age are neither valid, nor logical. More importantly they are not consistent with the United States Federal Civil Rights laws that are enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), nor are they moral in the international community by review of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html"
3,Dependable but mediocre,Arrived missing the piece that pierces the water jugs cap. It has been dependable (six months so far) but the hot water is closer to warm water and the cold water is just cool.
5,Perfect,"Perfect size for the counter top. Keeps 5 gallons of water available for use at a time. Hot side makes water VERY hot, so use caution, but this unit works great and Primo is a great company - I use Primo water with the cooler."
2,Didn't last long enough,I bought this water cooler for work. It only lasted about 8 months before the cooling feature stopped working. Then it was only room temperature water.
3,"OK, if you're not in a hurry","Pro: Hot water is very hot.Cons: Very slow flow from both hot and cold sides. Cold side cooler circuit runs constantly, but ""cold"" water is room temperature."
5,Praise and search,Ilove this video. The music is so beautiful it puts you in A beautiful state of mind. I have 2 videos and looking for more. THANK YOU ANDRE RIEU. from Florida
5,Absolutely wonderful! Classical music is revived!,"This video is just absolutely wonderful! With humor and playfulness, Andre Rieu brings classical music back to life. If all orchestras were like this, there would be a huge increase in listeners of classical music."
4,high marks,"Scott Turow gave this book high marks in his review (called it a 'gripping legal thriller') - so I took a chance. I wasn't disappointed. Engaging story, unexpected plot twists, good courtroom scenes kept me guessing (not an easy task ... I read plenty of these). I'd highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a relatively quick, very absorbing read."
3,Could have been better.,"Mostly surface stuff. I mean if you are into the blues you know blacks had it hard right? Duh. Mostly about Chess Record. Marshall Chess is a really nice guy and undoubtedly a positive force for the blues guys but I would have rather seen more about the artists and less about the business. Chuck D is a good guy too, and thoughtful but too much the in the center with Chess.I'm particularly interested in the aesthetic of the artists which didn't get much time. Of course blues/rock is party music, but among them, particularly Howlin' Wolf was extremely thoughtful and intelligent. I would have liked to see more about the nuts and bolts of how and why he and others made music. Not the chord changes but the strange stuff.Part of the appeal of this video is seeing former Miles Davis guitar Pete Cosey play. I would have liked to see much more of just him. He's an underrated monster of guitar, and the brief shots of him playing are awesome and tantalizing."
5,GUM compact soft toothbrush,"I was given this toothbrush by a dental hygenist student at my university and loved it! Like most women, I have a smaller mouth and it's a wonderful toothbrush that reaches all of my teeth without ""ramming"" into my gums and roof. I couldn't find it in any store so I bought 4 here to last a while!"
4,Great Tunes - NASTY Copy Protection!,"I love the CD, great music... better than the Otherness.BUT, the CD has some very nasty, intrusive copy protection that causes 2 of 3 players I own not to play the disc correctly - The ""Copy Control"" website warns some car CD players may have trouble playing the disc, in my case it's the only player that will play the disc correctly. Also, if you attempt to listen on your PC the disc requires you to update your operating system! I couldn't get the disc out of my computer fast enough... No Way some company is updating my system files to play a CD.I believe Sony had some issues with similar copy protection technology and ended up pulling the discs."
1,a really bad trip...,"Whatever they're calling themselves these days, Future Sound of London, a.k.a. Amorphous Androgynous, continue their regrettable and mind-boggling descent into laughable neo-psychedelia. Their previous misadventures into this territory, The Isness and The Otherness (get it?), at least benefited from Max Richter's luxurious production, but Alice In Ultraland expands upon the worst elements of those albums -- jangling guitars, noisy sound effects, awful vocals -- to create a really bad trip. I don't know what FSOL is smoking, but I sure hope they stop soon..."
4,a good history,"I just finished reading this book. Overall, I recommend it, although I think the author makes a much better historian than philosopher. Fortunately, he spends most of the book being a historian. The book covers the beginnings of a Devil concept in Zoroastrianism up to modern beliefs about the Devil. Naturally, there are surveys of Milton, Dante, and Faustian motifs. The author admits that his book is Christian-centric, which I can accept for the historical parts of the book. But I think he took a wrong turn in the last few, more philosophical, chapters where he dismisses modern materialism and skepticism of the existence of Satan."

5,Greatest TV show in the History of Television,"Of all the great shows on TV, this in my opinion was the best that ever aired. When are season 2 and 3 coming on DVD"
3,Looking back...,"I watched Picket Fences while I was still a teenager. There may not have been much on at the time but I'd remembered really enjoying it. As a young adolescent I probably enjoyed some of the contraversial topics covered in the series...Now, in 2007, the series really does seem outdated. I've cringed a number of times during the first few episodes (still not watched the whole DVD set since its arrived) as it can be so corny and lame. Even Ally McBeal didn't make me cringe in the same way (same director, yet a few years on).It's still quite watchable and possibly a decent 40 minutes (per episode) when there isn't much else on. Those of you who have watched (or are watching) more intelligent programmes at the moment may have to be warned about some of the corny and tacky scenes and plots in this series."
5,Best Entertainment that stimulates thoughts,"Picket Fences has always been my favorite. You see all sides of life through this TV series. You laugh, cry, and seem to grow wiser as each episode play out. The court debates are always stimulating your thoughts. The family value and the real world challenges are what I agree with the most. The Brocks are the perfectly non-perfect family that is artistically bond together by love, respect, and acceptance."
3,picket fences for a younger generatrion,"i remember recording repeat episodes in the mid 90s on my VCR because i was in school and it was the only time i had any kind of access to the show. it was an excellent show you could watch with out senseless sex and violence, it had intriging characters and moral and integrity!!! Why sren't so many of the good shows not yet on DVD yrt? Where'[s boston public? Chicago hope? third watch?"
4,Feb. 13th 2007,"I'm not writing a review, just a post because apparently Amazon hasn't updated their information. It is being released on DVD, Feb. 13th, 2007! So, sit tight, it will be here soon enough!"
2,Hope your remote is working,"I used to watch picket fences when it aired back in the day, and I couldn't wait till they released it on DVD...well they did..so I rushed online and purchase it..I still find the show quite funny..the only problem that I have with the DVD is the fact that it doesn't give you the option to hit play all...I understand when they first started putting shows out on dvd you had to hit play episodes for every episode you wanted to see..but come on now things have changed and I have dozen of DVDs that have the play all feature..so if u like holding your remote control while watching tv..this dvd is for you...I wished I didn't buy it because of it..makes me wish VHS was still in style"
1,cut or uncut? can anyone give a good review?,"Ok, until this day I still don't have a good review of Picket Fences DVD. For that reason I haven't pre-ordered the item yet.I hope somebody can confirm that all the episodes are uncut. I have read some stupid reviews about Zelda Rubestein and other actors being dubbed in the DVD release because of royalty rights.Can anyone help?tHANKS"
5,Picket Fences - a must see!!!,"This is an all around GREAT sequence, one I am hoping to see the second and all seasons. It covers all areas, sometimes funny,sometimes very serious, but always of a subject matter that we all face in our day to day existance. The husband is the town sheriff, the wife is the town doctor. Their kids are what we would all like our own kids to be like."
5,Great series,"I loved Picket Fences and it was great to get it available on DVD. The only problem you find when collecting a series such as this is that they release a Season and then you have to wait ages before the next. You have exceptional performaces and wonderful characters played by Fyush Finkel, Ray Walston and Don Cheadle. A must have."
3,"Good book for youngsters written in a good, straightforward language","This book is good, very good. I like his approach. He didn't teach my much new though. Nothing you can't find in 3 or 4 other books. So it IS really good value as it is all condensed in the one book. I like this guy, he's good."
1,Not worth the read,"I found this book to be too oversimplistic. It's written very poorly(even containing the odd completely unnecessary curse word!), and does not really stand to benefit the reader in any aspect. Any topics that are raised are simply discussed, and to gain any benefit whatsoever, you would have to refer to further material on the matter. On that basis, reaing this book does nothing but annnoy those who are looking for a good insight into managing your finances, on the grounds of it being severely 'unprofitable' as an educational asset, and a very poor return on time invested reading the book.Ultimately, as the other reviewers have expressed, it would be a much greater use of your time to look elsewhere for a better book on managing your finances, and based on the quality of this books content, that shouldn't be too hard."
2,Vida Exposed?,"More like In Ya Face records exposed. This ""film"" is as much about them as it is about Vida Guerra. You can find better crap on the Internet for free on Guerra rather than spending any money on this. It isn't worth it."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"Yes,the cover is okay but the inserts (planner, appointment list, address book) are too small if you want to write anything legible on it. I bought it cheap, but really not worth the $4.99 I paid for it."
1,How Lazy Can you BE?,"You can read Slaughterhouse Five in a few hours. Nobody needs the Cliffs Notes to this book. Everyone knows Cliffs notes are not used for notes, so all you lazy students, just read the actual book. It's worth your time. Cliffs Notes don't deserve any stars, and in this case, don't waste your money. The book is incredibly simple, and short. Don't make it meaningless!"
3,Confused!,"Don't know if it's just me, but I couldn't work this book out at all. Sure, I understood it but I couldn't really see what it was getting at. I understand this book is considered a literary classic in the USA so maybe it's because I'm a dumb English guy but, whilst I enjoyed it to a point, I couldn't really relate to it at all.So, three stars because I'm sure some of you will like it but it wasn't my cup of tea."
1,Buyer Beware,"If you are a new applicant in the federal job system, this book contains some useful, basic information.If you are a current federal employee, don't waste your money. The text is a warm, fuzzy hand-holding session with no useful information. You already know everything in this book, if not more...."
4,Author Is A Pro!,"This book provides excellent information on applying for a federal job and how to fill out the all important and sometimes make or break KSAs. If I had read this book earlier, I most certainly would have been selected for an interview instead of those that really didn't deserve to be promoted. I recommend buying a used book over a new one to save on costs."
2,Okay resource...,"...but hardly worth the money. The information contained in this book can be found in a multitude of other sources that are free. For example, try usajobs.opm.gov (even websites not solely devoted to federal jobs such as monster.com will do). However, to be fair, the information is accurate and well organized. I guess if you prefer a portable reference as opposed to internet research, this might work for you."
4,works great,Works great. Only con is trying to find an open station in an area with lots of stations.
2,Not so brilliant,"Let aside the fact that a casette plug beats it anyday audio wise, the device accepts too much interference. Aside from that, the + - buttons on the device do halt and wouldn't work perfectly.The device may be good in comparison with another transmitter, but being a casette user to link my iPod to the car, this is was a bad choice I've made!"
3,"Good idea, but...","I really liked the RDS function, but the actual FM transmitter part was one of the worst I've dealt with. Outside the city it was barely OK, but once I started getting close to downtown areas, it just didn't work at all. I went back to my Monster FM transmitter, which doesn't have the RDS, but works well even in the heart of downtown."
4,Good bang for your buck,"I received this transmitter as a Christmas gift. Initially, I found it frustrating to use as I would pick up interference from cell phones and cb radios, causing my music to cut out. After talking to friends who have other transmitters, apparently this is a common problem. The key is finding the right unused station in your area. I have figured it out and now I am very happy with the transmitter. Would recommend for others."
2,Will not fit all outlets,This unit will not fit all lighter sockets. I've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife's Saab 9-3. The 33185 version does fit.
5,Works out of the box,"I tried the Kensington and it worked right out of the box! There was very minimal static. For an FM transmitter, the really strength is proven only when it can capture another active channel (called the Capture Effect with some background noise due to the other transmission) and this transmitter did that without any problems! Transmission frequency is very stable as well. You can hear the audio clip at certain high pitches... but this again is very typical of any modulation-demodulation scheme. I did not expect CD quality (it can never be cos this is analog!) but the audio qualiy is great"
5,Excellent Product,this is an excellent product. I have RDS on my radio and just love the fact that I can now see the songs playing on my iPod through the display on my radio. I've purchased 4 of these because the tip comes loose if you're not careful. I did get a replacement within 14 days of notifying the manufacture.
1,Randy McEoin,Sadly I've discovered great inconsistencies with Bluetooth headsets. This LG HBM-300 failed to function properly with either of my two LG VX8300 phones. With either phone it had a horrible echo for the person calling me.I found it quite shocking that this LG headset would not work flawlessly with a relatively new LG phone. I even went to the trouble of bringing one of my phones into Verizon to update to the latest V03 software. That didn't help. It still echoed.Searching Google has yielded an assortment of headset echo problems with various headsets and phones. Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a sure fire headset to phone matching methodology.
3,Noisy,"Initially, the headset was great in terms of pairing and aesthetics. It was fairly easy to pair with my phone, and fit very comnfortably in my ear. I was able to wear the headset without any discomfort for hours.The one gripe that I have for this headset is the occasional ""background noise"". Numerous times I would have telephone calls with an annoying echo, or a hissing static noise. It probably occured around 40% of my phone calls, but the other 60% had great quality. I dont know if it was the phone I pairing it with, or the headset itself."
4,Works just fine,"I purchased this on december 2007, and now we'll get in to 2010, and it's been great about this blue tooth, I was just surprised about the price now, I bought it when it was $ 30.38 ( including shipping fee ), so I guess I was lucky."
2,S L O W!!!!,Will this device hold data? Yes. Is it small? Yes. Is it slower than floppy disks? YES. This is the slowest thumb drive I have ever used. 15 minutes to copy 100mb of files. It's not worth the hassle being so slow. I suggest you search elsewhere.
2,"small, cheap, slow","This is a very compact USB flash drive, with good capacity, and it is cheap. The plastic cap provides good protection. The main drawback is that this is a really really slow drive. It takes over an hour to copy 500MB onto it (from a hard drive, under Win XP). I can recommend this drive only for rarely-accessed archives, or if your time has no value."
4,Love it,"I need to back up all my class lectures, including illustrations, and this 4GB Firefly is just what I needed. It is a little slow, but that does not worry me too much. Its design is such that the small unit is separable from the cover, and so it plugs securely into my labtop USB without having a key ring dangling from it.Lexar are a very reliable company, and I also have two of their 1GB mass storage devices. Very satisfied with them as well."
5,Haunting and intense,"I tell you, this album is MADE for driving alone at night on the highway. Some music feeds the soul, but this music also feeds the imagination. It can take you into that higher plane of awareness and sensitivity to your surroundings. This cd has been instrumental (excuse the pun) in helping me understand that the creation of beautiful instrumental music isn't dead, it's just snuck into the film and TV industries to keep itself safe from the onslaught of pop."
1,"Score, NOT Soundtrack","As I was watching this film, I thought ""Wow, this will have a great soundtrack"" so naturally I bought this, but none of the music, except for the last track which plays during the credits, is on this album. There may be a soundtrack released at a later date; that's what marketing tends to do. I'd wait for that and/or just buy the single good track from this album (#24) from iTunes or the like."
2,"Catatonic dissonance, Arabic style","I am not sure where the guy above got his sense of rhythm and flow, because this album is anything like what he describes. In my opinion most of the music here is quite unsophisticated. Some of the vocals are decent but layered on top of unimaginative, repetitive, stiff loops; no sense of flow and harmony. He is right though when he points out this is not danceable music, it's not danceable nor enjoyable!To be fair, disc number one has some exceptions to the amateurish, non- depurated, crank-it-as-soon-as-possible, mass made cacophony of disk two. From barely passable to annoying as hell, mostly closer to the latter. Tons of better stuff out there to choose from if you are into mature, sensual, tasty world electronica."
5,short and sweet,"short and sweet. A must read if you are a runner, or looking into getting in ultra's. You will pick stuff up from this book; specifically the last pages. I have heard Dean speak in person on several occasions, he does not release a lot of detailed info for runners/ultra runners; but provides inspirational stories. Dean is genuinely a really nice guy!! The book will motivate you. I said I would keep this short and sweet; buy and read!"
2,Ego Maniac,"Having been a runner for over 20 years and just completed my first marathon, I was excited to read this book. The number of low ratings from other runners, however, scared me so I checked the book out of the library instead of buying it. This turned out to be a wise decision. The book reads easily and I finished it in one day. Mr. Karnazes is clearly a superior athlete whose performance is proof enough. The book is essentially the story of several of his runs. The chapter on his first Western States race was engaging. The problem, not minor, is the author's fascination with himself. Most runners are amongst the most humble people that I know. Egomaniacal is the word that comes to mind when reading this book. The one star ratings are all correct!"
3,Ultramarathon Man,"A fast, fun, and inspirational read. The guy is a machine....in 5th gear 24/7....his endurance, drive and heady accomplishments are mind-blowing. Oh, and he's extremely fortunate to have such a supportive wife and family."
5,Unbelievable Read,Probably the best book I've ever read. It's amazing how Dean was capable to turning things around in his life and able to achieve a level of self-fulfillment through his running. Very inspirational.
2,Not so great,"I'm a runner and was looking forward to reading this book as I am quite impressed by those who are willing to run the ultras. Sadly I found this book quite repititive and dull. Basically it is the same story told in diffrent race settings over and over again. He enters a race, goes through an inordinate amount of pain that no other person can stand and finishes it the majority of the time. I do admire him and the other athletes who compete in the events but just felt that this book was quite cliche. Also I found it interesting that Dean says he likes how underground the sport is, but have seen him on late night tv, magaines cover etc and he made sure to include the picture of him from the Sports illustrated sexiest man issue."
3,Review of Ultramarathon Man,It was just a summAry of a few of Deans runs. I did learn a few things though. would recommend.
5,Great and exciting read!,"A lot of people don't like Dean and the way he does what he does. I simply say, don't knock a guy for promoting himself and really well at that! I enjoyed his book and his story, even found it inspirational. It's a quick read and I even read it to my wife on a long drive last summer and we both had a blast doing it!"
5,One of my Favorites,"I love this book. It was well written and really spoke to me. I really had a hard time putting it down, but when I did all I wanted to do was go for a run. Very few people have the talent and time to come close to these accomplishments, but Dean didn't start at the top. I enjoyed hearing about how he got into running and just kept going! I would recommend this book to runners and non-runners alike."
3,Interesting and inspiring,"First off, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this book. It's GREAT read and one that will keep you interested throughout. However, it does get a bit redundant. He runs a marathon in the desert. He runs a marathon at the North Pole. He runs another marathon. Then another. Then another. Which to me got boring. It is very inspiring, though. No chance I believe his account of how he took a 7 hour run in his dress shoes one night on a whim, or whatever his tale was. Nonsense. I wasn't there, but I'm pretty sure he wrote that for shock value. But what do I know?If you're a runner or an exercise enthusiast, definitely pick this up."
1,terrible,I appreciate Dean Karnazes as a gifted athlete but I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I think Dean ought to stick to running.
1,If you want inspiration...,"I really wanted to like this book, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't. It is just filled with so much self-indulgence that it literally makes your head spin. Rather than cover off many of the points that have already been made, I'll make several other recommendatins:1) Running with the Buffaloes: true account of the 1998 Colorodo Varsity cross country team. Lots of drama, humility and implied training advice2) Once a Runner: Fictional cult classic.3) The Greatest: Autobiography of one of the world's truly fittest men, Haile Gebresellasie. Undefeated over 10,000m for 8 years.I've read each of these books and everytime, I was dying to get out for a run."
2,Filled with hyperbole and bravado,"I had to get the book, since there aren't many books on ultra running. You'd think that somewhere in his book he'd mention the names of some of the greatest ultra runners of all time, such as Ann Trason or Yiannis Kouros. There's not even a hint that there have been others quietly doing what he does and even more. If he had, I would have liked him a little better and would have been more likely to put up with his hyperbole and bravado.As others have noted, I lost most of my respect for DK when he started trashing the Boston Marathon when comparing it to the Western States 100. After that, I found it difficult to get past his exaggerations without wondering how much truth there was behind his words."
3,"oh dean, you're so crazy!","that's what he wants you to say, anyway, i'm sure. but gimme a break! i'm 1/2way done w/this book and couldn't wait any longer to write this review. another reviewer mentioned ""self-promotion"" and ""false humility."" yeah, ya think? well put. good grief! this excerpt almost had me gagging: ""...my body reached a level of fitness that defied all sensible limitations."" seriously? well, at least you're modest, dean! yes, the stories of his adventures and races (and the book overall) were very interesting, and his level of fitness, etc. are amazing and inspiring, but the self promotion is really hard to swallow. if you can get past that part, go for it."
4,Insane,"Dean Karnazes is one sick puppy. I'm a marathon runner, so when I heard about the guy who ran 300 miles straight (over 11 full marathons) I had to read his book. By the time he wrote the book the longest continuous run he had done was ""only"" 199 miles. It's amazing the boundaries this guy has surpased. The first time he ran it, it took him 46 hours and he ate 28,000 Calories! The book is a very fast read. It'll take less time to read than to run the Western States 100. As you may guess, part of the book is a little repetative. After all, he's just running, but the book is inspirational. Reading the book makes me want to start on my goal of completing an ironman. Even if you're not an endurance athlete, you'll still be amazed at tenacity of Karnazes."
2,Ultra Ego Man,"By any definition, Dean Karnazes has incredible endurance, but no less impressive are his mammoth ego and complete lack of humility.I found the book interesting to a point. I also found it tiresome, reductive, sexist and borderline offensive and I ended up feeling sorry for his children and wife, barely mentioned in the book except in the most unidimensional terms and reduced to spending every vacation schlepped around in a motor home to watch daddy run.A passage, presented with great intended humor, relating to his sending a tampon to a friend as a gesture of the man's weakness left my jaw on the floor with disgust and shock. I also found it ironic that he mentioned so little related to the birth of his children, an endurance event that most women would gladly trade for an overnight run.Since ultra endurance athletics is becoming so much more mainstream, I'm certain that many more interesting and well written stories will soon emerge. I look forward to that."
1,ultraboring man,"run with your heart, push your self, run 100 miles eating a huge pizza and cheese cake on the run etc etc.... he might be a natural running talent but the author has not much to say, ultra thin, ultra boring, ultra about nothing bookish money trap!! try scott jurek or macca"
2,Big disappointment,"I was expecting some useful and inspiring information here like I found in other books such as Eat and Run or Born to Run. However, I've just found a series of achievements poorly described and not very interesting to me. At some point it looks like a boring (and quite gocentric and colorist) adventure book."
2,not as good as I hoped,"This book includes a bit of biographical background plus descriptions of several races that the author has run. While the idea of running 100 miles is astonishing, the simple truth is the the motivation is hard to pin down but the method is simple (Nike co-opted this in their advertising, but it rings true for the author: just do it). I had hoped for much more, and the author floats ideas such as this: running long distances in the middle of the night makes him closer to his family. Uh, huh? I don't think so. Wait for the paperback or get it at the library; not worth twenty bucks."
5,Great book,I would put it into the runner must read list. Great book - especially when you listen to the audio version of it on your long runs.
3,"so, so","Interesting world that I had no idea existed, but written by a guy with a pretty big ego. Some good anecdotes, some bravado, overall entertaining read."
4,"Easy to read, very good book","I would like a little more information in some special details, for example in diet, workouts, etc..... id. est. some tips for me to improve my running.Any way it is very good book."
4,Inspiring and Entertaining,"Dean Karnazes makes running long distances seem like the most important physical test that you can endure and you feel like you're missing out as he leads you through the outlandish race conditions and events. Can you imagine running a double marathon up a hill battling dehydration and hypothermia? What makes it an excellent story is that he believes in what he does so deeply that he's inspirational.I hate running. I'd rather bike or swim or sit on the couch watching someone else run. As I was reading this book on a cross country flight, I couldn't don the shorts and run around the block a few times which is all I could think of doing. But it's also entertaining. Can you imagine being the pizza delivery guy meeting him on a dark corner at 2am?It's a short book and it's not one that you'll want to put down so depending on your reading speed it might not be bad to start before it gets too late at night."
2,"Coulda been better, coulda been worse","If you like reading about extreme sports, there is probably enough here to hold your attention for a while. But if you like a good read, then I wouldn't expect that much. There's a fine line between a good author who could say something fascinating about a petrified turd and an average author who could make a great story fall a bit flat. Unfortunately, we're dealing here more with the latter than the former, which is kind of a shame, since Karnazes' story, if put in the hands of a better author, could have made for a great read. But what can you do? I found myself skimming a lot, moving past the repetition and filler (and periodic bouts of boasting), hoping to reach the end soon and get on to something else. I definitely respect what Karnazes has done athletically. No doubt there, and I am not trying to take anything away from him. Impressive guy. I'm just not sure that this book translates his experience all that well."
1,Self Centered,The book is nothing more than Dean telling us what an incredible athletic Dean is. Dean pretty much pats himself on the back the whole boring book.
4,Inspirational and a little puzzling,What inspired me about Dean Karanzes was his sense of determination. Why on Earth would anyone run 226.2 miles? Read this book and somehow you can start to make sense of it. If you're looking to get off the couch as a first time athlete or just need a little reassurance that your desire to always physically push yourself to your limit is not yours alone I'd suggest this book. It's as puzzling as it is captivating.
3,An Entertaining and Motivational Read,"This is a quick, entertaining read about Dean Karnazes and how his running life progressed from childhood to the present. Karnazes provides the reader with snap-shots of what it's like to be on long runs and in ultramarathon races that push the body to the edge. There could have been a lot more detail of Karnazes routines and training, but this information must have been omitted to keep the book amusing to a broader audience that wouldn't necessarily want to know about the real grind. Overall this is a light, inspirational and motivational read."
3,"Good quality, not practical","I purchased a cherry wood vanity. The product arrived in great quality, however I do not use it frequently and am not happy with it. The vanity mirrors are tiny! You have to be less tan 5'0"" tall to be able to see yourself in the mirror, even if you are sitting on the stool. This is mainly due to the mirrors being very narrow. I wish the seller made larger side mirrors for the vanity, as the product is expensive. I would not purchase the product again, if I could go back in time! Please beware."
1,Wrong item!,"I don't know what the hell is wrong with this company. Apparently other people have been having the same problem with receiving a product that comes in a ""Megaware"" box with the wrong item. This particular listing didn't get any negative feedback so I thought it might be okay. The vanity in this box is darker and the seat cushion is completely different than pictured (in addition to being absolutely hideous). I'm in the process of returning it as write this. Really, incredibly annoying."
3,its alright,"being a die-hard Priest fan,I`ve got all their cd`s,including tributes.When I bought this one,I figured""ok,Lets see what this one sounds like"".I found I was fast-forwarding alot of the songs.Why? The sound is to techno-and like they were in a garage playin for the first time.If your into Priest,like me,I wouldnt buy this one."
4,Huh,"I purchased this with the Yoshi counterpart. Now one would have thought that this would be great gifts for 2 little kids as they could build a course and race them. Unfortunately, they both operate at the exact same frequency and one remote will take over both cars. Thus far, I have found no way to change the frequency. If you are looking to buy just one, it is pretty cool and more durable than you might think. I was crashing it all over this morning chasing my nephew with the vehicle and it was none the worse for wear."
4,radio controlled donkey kong kart,"My grandson loved it, I gave it to him as a present and he just spends hours playing and racing it."
3,funtional but narrow,"Item works fine however they're only 2/3 as wide as the hardwood bows I used previously, so I had to get different sockets. Would've been nice if the description included the width. Also, the bow was not shipped with rubber end covers mentioned in the description."
4,One toke over the line!,This is something that should go without saying but anyone who is a fan of the film should have this soundtrack.It features lines from the film and all the classic tunes that were in the film except for one or two but it does not hurt the overall value here.If you are a fan and dont already have this then get this now!If you have never seen the film then this is a good introduction.This is also good for people just looking to dig some classic tunes from the 60's and 70's.Just one toke man!One toke over the line!
4,Good... but missing the key! Can you help me find it?,"Ok I'm not really 13, I just couldn't figure out how to use the original review form... too complex. This CD was great, it was everything I was hoping to find in a great mix for any mood. But the only thing was, I was looking for this album so I could find that song that plays in the opening credits, the trippy version of ""my favorite things"" sung in harmonies by several girls. Perhaps I am thinking of the wrong film completely but I was sure it was used in the opening of this one. I was disapointed that this album didn't include that song, so if anybody knows what the title of the song or who wrote it or even if I am on the right track, (...) Even still, this was a great album to listen to, you should go out an buy it!"
4,It's insane.,"This soundtrack is near perfect for two things: a road trip, a drug trip, or both. Of course the movie pretty much spelled that out for us. This is an eclectic mix, and a good one at that. It includes classic rock like ""One Toke Over The Line"", ""Get Together"", and ""Mama Told Me (not to come)"". Also a few oldies like ""She's A Lady"", ""Tammy"", and ""Magic Moments"". Plus excellent songs from ""Jefferson Airplane"" and ""Buffalo Springfield"" (Neil Young). All that music, and inserts from the film make this a must have. I wanna get a big old convertible just to play this album in."
3,Underrated,"Why do the band generally consider this to be a bad album? While it contains a couple of weak tracks (November (better heard though worse-titled as Mighty Girl on the Peel Sessions CD), Seven Days Awake) and the ghastly Like INOBE GOD, which sounds like bad Caribbean karaoke of something funereal, the other four are quite ace blends of mostly funk, groove and psychedelia, with good things from the whole band. The two tracks written by Rosko Gee (Pauper's Daughter & I - which recalls Sunshine Day and Night from Saw Delight, especially in Karoli's fluid off-kilter guitar licks - and the catchy and rather lovely Give Me No ""Roses"") are probably the strongest songs and his vocals are a pleasant surprise. Pity the remaster is poor."
1,Arrrrggggh...,"Exit Holger Czukay, and drag Rosko Gee to the fore, and what do you get? Well, in this case, you get an unfocussed dog of a record that only has personnel to link it to the Can releases that go before. If I could give this zero stars, I would. This is the absolute nadir of a creative slide that began around the time of ""Landed"", with the band's adoption of multi-track methods of production, and sees Can tossing out well-held ideas like their creative improvisatory process to work on actual set 'songs' by Rosko Gee in places, and at other points working out in directionless, meandering jams. It bears noting that this, of all of Can's official releases, is the sole one not reissued on their Spoon label."
1,avoid,"I disagree with others here; Serpentine is aptly titled with Karoli's classic sinuous lines, and terrific funky bass from Gee. The whole thing is mellow like nothing since Future Days. WARNING: This CD edition is mastered off an LP played on a poor quality turntable. Crackles are clearly audible, there is little dynamic range, and very poor definition. Therefore: music 4 stars; release NO stars. Avoid. Come on Can, put it out on Spoon"
2,Skip this one,"The recordings Can made following the departure of founding member Holger Czukay (such as this one) were consistently weak and uninteresting compared to the phenomenal output the group made in the 1960's and '70's. The albums _Ege Bamyasi_, _Tago Mago_ and _Monster Movie_ are strong and inspired and won't disappoint. _Out of Reach_ will."
4,"Actually, Not Bad","The band themselves want to forget about this one. They chose not to reissue it on their Spoon label, and create discographies that leave it out. They cannibalized and idea or two onto their next album and pronounced this junk.But it's not so bad. Side 1 is good stuff. It's strong group improvisation with impressive themes and impressive playing, bracketing a vocal song which burbles along in impressive form.Side 2 falters though - the last 3 tracks are abysmal, and definitely a low point for the band. Too bad they don't want to salvage the first 3 or 4 though."
1,Where is the weave,"this floss is a bunch of individual fibers, I hate it. I wanted a woven floss not this junk. It catches on my fillings etc. and bunches and tears. Itdoesn't make sense to have to floss the floss out."
2,Product didn't match the picture,The product I received did not match the product pictured when I made the purchase. I will not be purchasing anything else from this seller.
2,Serious flaw: slippery,"This floss, once slightly wet, is impossible to hold onto, because it gets very slippery. This makes the flossing really challenging. Sure it is thick as others mentioned. But do keep this serious drawback in mind. Personally, I would recommend other brands because of this flaw."
4,The best is hard to find,"This floss is the best you can buy, hands down. Unfortunately, it is also nearly impossible to find it on store shelves. The best description I have read has been ""other floss just cuts the film on your teeth"", exactly! This stuff actually removes all that gunk. I waited too long to order this and I'm having to use crappy thin waxed floss, and hating every minute of it. You have to re-floss the same teeth 2, or 3 times in order to get the same level of thorough clean this stuff can do on a once over. My only gripe is how expensive it is. At this price, I'm convinced it's made from the hair of orphaned children, or possibly the mane of a unicorn. I suppose you get what you pay for though."
4,Dental Floss,I am extremely happy with this product. I have used it for years and have a hard time finding it in the stores. My experience has always been a pleasant one with Amazon.
2,Spain Land of Contrasts,"This video reminds me of something from 1960-70. The narrator's voice is not the least bit appealing. The comments are extremetly dated, ""this is a real kodak moment."" The video is of some value as it circumnavigates the entire country. Other than that aspect you would be better off purchasing another video. I was very disappointed with this purchase. I would highly recommend Cities of Light."
2,Some good and some bad,"This is was originally a bootleg from concert recordings in 1968 just before Uncle Meat was released. Parts of this CD have been released on other bootlegs. It is about 65 minutes long and the sound quality is OK. It is a bootleg, not professional sounding, but in some ways is better than many live albums released today, like those by Dave Matthews.This CD consists mostly of the same musical piece (I forget the name...maybe it is Uncle Meat)played at 3 different concerts in 3 different ways. The pieces range from 14 to 17 minutes long.The worst part of this CD is the horrible 6 minutes of Wild Man Fisher screaming his head off. It is just painful to get through. This is probablby a 3 to 4 star CD but I knock it down because of this Wild Man Fisher crap."
4,Not bad for just wanting one song....,"I bought this album about a year ago, cause we wanted the song ""Ice Ice Baby"" for a school talent show(This was the only album that had it...we couldn't even find the original Vanilla Ice CD!) But I like almost all of the rest of the songs on it...they remind me of my youth. You really have to have grown up in the 80s(or early 90s) to enjoy it."
5,Laissez-faire,"This album contains the most inventive and refreshingly interpretive rendition of Master of Puppets I've ever heard.You've heard every one else on the planet, now here some new views. And if Dee Dee's Jump in the Fire isn't the punkest, then Shotgun Remedy's For Whom the Bell Tolls takes the cake."
1,What is This??,"this cd is pretty bad, I mean I like punk and metal, but crossing punk rhythm with metal lyrics it's.. well I laughed pretty hard listening to it. Because it's a completely different attitude punk and metal-- it's a weird mix."
1,Horrendous,"That rendition of Jump in the Fire is terrible. I'm offended. Don't buy this, its a crime."
5,Awesome Magnetic Tool Holder,"I bought a magnetic tool holder to hold my jewelry tools. They were all in a basket, which was disasterous for my fingers when I reached in! I really like the units. I use the large and medium one for my tools because I have a lot.I really don't have any complaints. They work well. I guess if you had to pick SOMETHING out, they could be offered in a more girly color. :o)Overall, great product!"
2,Sorry I bought them,"After purchasing five 24"" Neiko brand magnet strips I purchased this set. Mistake!The magnets are weak by comparison and oriented in such a manner as open end & combination wrenches stick to each other. This does not happen when the magnets are oriented differently. It appears that Neiko has adopted this design...or purchases them from a different supplier.The product which I bought is now offered as Master Magnetics Magnetic Tool Bar - 24in.Wide Model# 07261.This product's magnets go the full 24"" and have excellent grip strength."
3,Not Miller's Best,"While I have liked some of Sue Miller's books (""The Good Mother"" and ""Inventing the Abbotts""), this one was very unsatisfying to me (as was ""While I Was Gone""). I never felt that I knew the characters and because of this, could not understand their motivation. It was as though I was viewing them through a cloudy lens...the characterizatons just never were clear.I tried to feel sympathy or even empathy for Lottie and Cameron, but could never muster any. They just never really engaged me as a reader.Also, parts of their history and background seemed to be missing, as if lost in all of the changes of time that Miller used.I will try ""Family Pictures"" next.....hope I can get more involved."
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read,"This book was so tedious and boring that I found it difficult to believe it was by the same author of ""While I Was Gone."" I didn't care about any of the characters; all were shallow and one-dimensional. None of them behaved like real people. And nothing happened! I didn't understand why Lottie felt disassociated from her husband, and I didn't understand Elizabeth at all. She was shrill and silly. I understand what the author was trying to say--I think--but it just didn't work. Too dense and wordy--which is fine when an author has something to say--but not when an author writes just for the sake of seeing her own words."
2,a long book that seems to get longer as you read it,"The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all. The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest. There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness."
4,one of her best,this is my 4th sue miller book and it is my favorite. the main character is a flawed and complicated woman struggling to be in a committed relationship despite her fiercely independant nature. the story runs backwards in time which is really well done. it is an interesting look into people's inner worlds and how they define love.
1,I'm afraid I forced myself to finish this book!,"I had a really hard time with this book and I listened to the audio cassettes. It was a very long story about one incident, the wreck, that was drawn out way too long. This is my first taste of Sue Miller and I'm afraid my last. If you are bored and like to read about insignificant things such as how a person likes their tea or coffee, then this is the book for you."
2,Not her best effort,"Basically 339 pages that say nothing of value. A story about ""LOVE"" which Lottie is to write but can't and in the end doesn't. Though love isn't just a feeling--one has to work at it--is stated in the book, it is not backed up by the details touched on by the many characters in the story.This one was tough to struggle through in order to finish reading."
1,This was the only book I brought on vacation and I was miserable,I really wanted to like this book but simply could not! Forced myself because this was all I had with me over a weeks vacation but was a horrible read. I could not get interested in this book at all. The only time the book was at all engaging to me was during a conversation (at the end!) between Lottie and Cam. SKIP THIS and read her other books.
1,Don't waste your time,"""For Love"" started out good, but went downhill fast. The plot went nowhere. The only action in the story is in the first few pages. I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste any money on it."
5,Wonderfully written,"Sue Miller manages to write very insightful novels. They are very informative about life. Compassion, angst and love, I love them all."
4,I always enjoy Sue Miller's books.,"I enjoyed this book,but then again I always enjoy Sue Miller's novels.She has this way of making me feel close to her main characters. So anyway Sue,Is Lottie Ok? Has she found contentment in life? Please write me at Babz@aol.com. I am about to read ""The Distinguished Guest""--I heard it was really great! I'll let you know. Barb"
5,Absorbing and beautifully done,"I don't know how she does it: Melissa McConnell weaves together elements of the spy thriller, political melodrama, chick lit and literary fiction, and, somehow, makes it all work. ""Evidence of Love,"" despite the sappy title, is a genuine page-turner with interludes of expertly done memoir and description. As someone who hates ""The West Wing"" and considers most political fiction deadly, I found McConnell's description of the White House and its intrigue fascinating and accessible. The ending falls a bit flat, especially after the writer has shown evidence of talent far beyond the typical thriller, but the book still holds up as a well-written, suspenseful and insightful read. I hope it finds some readers who can think outside the genre."
5,Loved this book,This book is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a very long time. Melissa McConnell tells this haunting story with perfect attention to detail...I was unable to put it down. I am now a devoted fan of Melissa McConnell and anxiously await her next book.
4,"at first,, an off-putting title........but--","as other reviewers in this space have noted, this book is much more than it's title, and yes, it was riveting, for me. i thoroughly enjoyed the main characters, the intrigue, and the surprise element, did truly surprise me!"
5,The indie music lovers band. You have not head it all until you have heard this album,"This is Mr. Bungle meets John Zorn with a dash of the 90's San Diego music style in it. This album is definitely have your cake and eat it too. There is at least one song on this album you will like a lot then the next time you will love another. This album is the all time ""it grew on me"" album. I picked up this CD without knowing anything about these guys. I found it in the local section of my record store. Then found out this was one of the San Diego All Star Bands. Rust fans hate this band (Tim is the bass player for both) and Creedle fans hate Rust. Drive Like Jehu Fans love Creedle and so on...........You will never hear another band just like these guys. I don't think anyone actually has it in them. Thanks guys for blessing the world with your audio divinity! Pablo Verde"
3,Huckleberry Pie.,"Was kind of disappointed. I bought this product a year or so ago and it was awesome. This time I bought it for my father, who has cancer, and it was sickly sweet. Almost to sweet to eat."
5,children creating wonderful art out of adversity,This is an amazingly original book in a storybook format and incorporates actual artwork done by children being treated at the MD Anderson Hospital. Their artwork is not only delightful but inspiring for all people not only those in a lifethreatening battle to return to wellness.
4,great dvd,This is a really good instructional dvd for beginners to professionals. Todd was very simple in explaining his techniques. A must have for everyone.
1,Horriable Book,"This is the greatest school ever, how anyone can hate it escapes me. We are god-like in our intellect and engineering prowess. I have 303 reasons why this book needs to be banned in the usa."
1,Bunch of bitter people...,Title says it all. Quit your bitchin! Nobody is making you stay. Transfer of if you can't handle it.
5,Good old mind-bending fun,"Nicely built, good fun. I think it should come with a book :) - glad to find one to give my kids."
5,Great mind game,"These are a classic and these are great in quality! We still haven't figured out how to get them back ""pretty"" yet, but they are fun. Winning Moves is a great company and shipping was superb. I would recommend them to anyone."
1,5 Stars for the real one - zero for this piece of crap,"I bought one in Walmart,out of the box it fell apart in all its pieces after 3(!) turns. All blocks are hollow and the middle pieces break off.I want my old one from the eighties back!!! - that was at least twice as heavy and I used it for years without any problems.Shame on this cheap spin-off."
1,THIS CUBE IS PURE TRASH,"CAN'T BELEAVE AFTER 25 FIVE YEARS THIS COMPANY MADE THIS PEACE OF TRASH AND STILL SELL IT,, I STARTED TURNING IT AND I DID PROBABLY WARM IT UP TOO MUCH AND THEN THE STICKERS BEGAN TO COME OFF, I GOT ONE IN BETWEEN OF MY FINGERS, WHAT A PITY,, THIS IS JUST FUNNY,,, IF U ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS THING, YOU BETER LOOK FOR THE ONE THAT HAS SOLID PLASTIC INSTEAD OF THESE STICKERS,, DISAPPONINTED... THANKS"
1,Rubik's Cube - manufactured by Winning Moves,"What a super-cheap rip-off of the original Rubik's Cube that was introduced to us in the mid-'70's. Seems like every doctor's office, break room, friend's basement, etc. had one of these cubes to kill time with. Main reason that I, personally didn't like this modern version was that after the first day or two, the colored stickers start to peel off. The Rubik's Cube HAD it's day. In this high-tech age, I cannot see many kids having any interest in this item. They might actually have to 'use' their brain. PLEASE don't bring back the Pet Rock. Avoid!"
5,Great Puzzle !!,"Above average quality, stickers may come off as you use, mine is still intact. Found tutorial videos on youtube which made me buy this."
3,It's okay,"I bought the Rubik's cube for my plane ride to London and found it an incredible challenge. However I have a few things I disliked about it. Firstly, I dropped it and a few cubes smashed off. Secondly, on trying someone elses cube I found that mine was very rustly and didn't seemes like a well oiled toy. Overall it's okay but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,super durable,"This 3x3 is extremely durable, but one thing I noticed is that it's stickers began to peel after a good month and was slowing my solving. Its worth the low price."
3,Not the best,"My friend recently got me into Rubik's cubes and has several himself. I figured the actual Rubik's brand would be the best, so I went ahead and got this one. However, it is quite a bit tighter than my friends cubes, and since it doesn't have adjustable tension there's really no way to fix that. Consequently these cubes are very prone to locking up and it's nearly impossible to complete the cube with any semblance of speed. For just simple solving this cube works fine, but if you're looking for something to do some speed solving I would recommend finding some more advanced models."
2,Rubik's cube is just so so.,"Sold by: SCS Collectibles, Inc, not the same package it pictured. It is a simple cheap plastic package.First touch, it is difficult to make a turn. really disappointed.After a oil, it can be played, but it can't be a speed cube."
4,Good Cube,"I have always wanted to learn how to complete a Rubik's cube and decided to get this cube to start with. I did not know there were other options at the time that may be better as you get faster at completing but either way it doesn't really matter.This cube is great. It is not a speed cube, so it is not designed to move seemliness and fast as a DIY cube or a specially made cube. That being said it does have the benefit of being durable and standard. It is a great learning cube but if you want something faster for speed cubing DO NOT get this one even the website tells you not to get it if you are trying for speed. They have other options which are great as well.One downside to almost all cubes though is that the stickers always seem to curl up after awhile. They have a few, however, that have fixed plastic insets."
1,Poorly made,"Gave this to my 14-YrOld son who has already mastered other Rubik's puzzles. This one was a disaster right out of the box. Super stiff and won't come apart so he can lubricate it the way he does with his others. Terribly made. It could be fun and educational, but not when it won't work!"
3,Eh,"Does not come in the packaging shown above, but it might not be the same as other customers. Pretty cool for a little gift."
2,"Really slow cube, wasted my money on this.",this cube is really slow and is bad for speedcubers. i recommend buying the rubiks cube from Hasbro. the cube is fun but really slow and i cant solve it fast.
5,What's not to like?,"The Rubik's Cube is one of the most popular all around hobbies that most kids use. I bought one last year, but i took it apart and it broke (100% my fault), so I thought I'd get another one, since I had so much fun with my last one. I am 13 years old and I used to play video games but now I can't and I don't have cable television, so this is the next best entertainment form I can have. If you are looking for a fun, cheap, and durable (unless you take it apart and break it =]) toy, this is the one to get!"
3,Cube Review,"Nice seeing the 25th anniversary cube, but the price was a bit high. Works fine, when I work at it, but again, knock off cubes work the same and are only one dollar.Thanks for the speedy service"
2,Has terrible durability,I recently picked up one of these from a puzzle shop in the local mall. It was quite fun but the durability and quality is very questionable. It didn't slide wonderfully when brand new and now it jams even when you line it up really well. Since this only has under 3 hours of play I would not consider that acceptable. I hope they improve build quality for their future products.
1,Piece Of #@~,"This product its a big piece of SHIT, without the Box, without the base, pure shit.... @#?)&%$ YOU, Don't Buy this Crap, you are gonna lose your money"
3,Not so smooth,"I thought as an original Rubik's cube it would be very smooth and easy to turn. But it seems like a cheap rubik's, just with a better quality of the materials. I have lubricated it and now it is Ok, not so fast, but is OK."
5,The best cube of them all,"This is definitely the most fun of all the rubik's cube. I own a 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, and I always enjoy solving this one. They're great fun trying to speed solve, yet they still prove a challenge in all the different varieties of ways to be mixed up. You can pick it up and be done with in within minutes and still be entertained. Once you get to the higher up cubes, it takes a bit more time, but they're fun as well. There's just nothing like the original 3x3."
3,Color stickers should be replaced.,"While moving parts quality is acceptable, a thin film for color stickers and color shades are just horrible. I purchased another cube for a dollar in local ""99 cents"" store, which has polished, solid plastic color stickers with ridged edges (as it used to be). However, this cure had awful moving parts. So I peeled off plastic stickers form it and ""crazy glued"" them over ""Wining Move"" cube. Now it almost feels like the one I used to have some quarter century ago."
4,Many hours of fun or frustration,You gotta love the rubics cube. It is just an all time favorite and classic toy. I remember playing with this toy 30 years ago. Once i removed the stickers to complete the puzzle. Of course this ruins the toy for future attempts at the puzzle. Then later i learned how to take it apart and reassemble the puzzle so it was solved.Now as an adult i just sit up for hours ever so close to solving it without the former mentioned tactics.The cube comes with instructions for solving. i just don't get them though.Still you gotta love the rubics cube
4,Back to the Future...,"The cube remind me of myself twenty years ago!Got couple of cheapo cubes ($1, $2 versions) and the original is still the best!The only reason why I did not give it a higher star is the Cube Professor is a WAY better challenge. I only play the 3x3x3 when my daughter requests it."
1,"Recived broken, added pictures to the gallery.","When I received this package, the plastic covering was smushed severely and the Rubik's cube was half falling out. The stand for it, was snapped in half. I have included pictures in the gallery. (as long as Rubix doesn't delete them) For 10$, I did not expect this product to be fantastic, but I did expect it to come in one piece. To pay 5$ for shipping it back is not worth it. Thanks Rubix, for a piece of crap. -_-"
2,Not recommended.....,"This cube has bad stickers and sometimes pop. It locks A LOT and corner cutting is bad.. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO CAN SOLVE RUBIK'S CUBE UNDER 40 SEC. I like my dayan zhanchi better. If you're new to rubki's cube, then you might want to get thiss."
4,winning moves 3x3x3,"If you plan on speed cubing, you must modify and lube the cube. I was able to pop the pieces to spray the internals with silicone. The cube has a very sturdy feel compared to my Da Yan, which traditional cubers will probably like. The stickers are starting to wear in the corners. This might not be an issue if you arent planning on speedsolving. With a traditional ""Rubik's"" cube, you will not be breaking any records, but it is a great puzzle to learn the algorithms and have as a display piece."
4,Quite fun,"Great buy. Got the item exactly as adverstised. Not sure what the other postings are talking about in regards to the stickers coming off. All jokes aside, perhaps this item is not meant for people with sweaty palms."
2,"comes completed, sooo, no real reason to buy this","should not be shipped completed, not much motivation to use this now. ill just tell people i did it all myself"
5,Still one of the best,"I've never actually owned a cube myself until just recently and can't believe how much I toy with this thing. This little algorithmic device is a frustrating bundle of challenging fun. If you like mind puzzles and games, the rubiks cube is definately one of the best."
5,My kids love it.,"My 15 year old enjoys a challenge. He figured it out over a weekend then worked on decreasing his time and enjoys amazing his friends. It didn't cost very much and he enjoys it a lot.My 7 and 5 year old like to do whatever big brother does, so they are learning to solve one side for now."
1,Wow....,"Lube this cube. If you don't want to, then go elsewhere and get a better cube. The lube is required for this cube to turn even remotely half decent. The stickers peel off way to easily, you can't losen the tension on the cube. Unless you feel like wasting 11 bucks, don't buy it."
2,just OK,"If you want a fast speedcube, you don't want this.After buying this cube, I tried to dismantle this thing, but it took me forever. There is pretty much nothing I can do about it until I got a silicone oil. It became better after lubrication. But still, it's only good for educational purpose or for a kid, maybe. If you want a speedcube, find something else."
5,Retro toy,"If you want a good old fashioned rubiks cube, this is perfect. It works well, is durable and the price is right. My 4 year old wanted it because he saw one at his older cousin's. I first overpaid for one at a retail store, not realizing it didn't turn like the traditional rubiks cube. It was electronic and made a bunch of noises. I can't figure out how to use it, let alone a child. I then found this on Amazon and it was just what I needed. My child doesn't yet understand the concept of it, but he has fun with it and hasn't harmed it in any way."
3,Dirk,"Eventhough this toy has been around for a long time - you would think they would have perfected it. Instead, it appears they have cheapened it. Labels were pealing off when we opened the box. Poor quality."
5,Its a Rubik's Cube,"Exactly as pictured, the stand is nice and proudly displays how smart I am by having a solved cube. After getting it finished though I have not touched it. #Lazy"
2,I am just disappointed,"I bougth this toy for my kids as their first Rubik's cube. It worked fine for a few weeks but then the color stickers started to come out, until it was just unpleasant to play with the cube. I am just disappointed of the low quality of this cube."
3,rubik's cube,The stickers come off after playing with it all day of figuring it out. it is good for what it does.
2,What ever happened to 'MADE IN THE USA',"Okay, the concept of this game cube is great, and believe me: you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle.Now on to the reality...I first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out. Upon its first release, the stickers stayed on, the plastic squares didn't break off, and it just seemed like a higher quality piece. I beleive the plastic might have been heavier.But now, twenty years later, the stickers peal off, the squares pop out. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!If this was made in the USA it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas, however ...it wouldn't be junk.You get what you pay for.Stephen John BecciaAuthor of The Treelanders"
1,Poor quality,"The Rubik's brand cube is probably one of the lowest quality cubes you can buy. The plastic is notoriously ""crumbly"" and the stickers will peel off. I owned one of these for several years, however one of the center pieces snapped off. Other cubes have removable centers held on by screws, making them easy to adjust or replace. This cube has the centers held in by irremovable pegs, making it impossible to repair.I also have a 5x5 rubik's brand cube, and after a short while of using it one of the corners snapped. From my experience with Rubik's brand cubes, it seems the plastic used is not the best type for this toy."
2,"Good for a whim, but not for speedsolving","The Rubiks brand of puzzle cubes is arguably the worst brand for solving the cube quickly, or speedcubing. If you're looking to get into speedcubing, I suggest getting a different brand than this. It doesn't turn corners well, and its sluggish to move (even after lubricating it).However, this cube is very sturdy and difficult to break. Great to buy on a whim for some cheap fun."
3,Disappointing substitute from the Original,"Out of the box, the cube is stiff, cannot be really speeded very well, and I assume it's going to go downhill from here. Doesn't have the feel, crispness, and mechanical snap of the original by Ideal. Why is it so difficult to duplicate the original? Well for us addicts what are we going to do?"
1,"bought two, both crappy","I'm just a beginner, and even I can feel how stiff and narrow this thing is when you try to rotate a face. I could be doing it wrong, but the cube gets all crooked when I spin a face quickly. You have to align the cube just right to get this darn thing to turn, otherwise, it'll get stuck in position. Even forcing it will make the cube feel like the corner piece will break off. I tried using spray, but it did not make a difference. Works sort of okay for beginners like me, but totally not recommended for speed cubers."
2,the stickers suck,"I love the rubik but the stickers they have suck. it's not the old school stickers, this rubik is made up of 3 layers. a white base layer, then the color layer (which seems like it's painted on) and then a thin clear sticker. after a week of use, the thin clear sticker starting peeling and after that the color layer just rubs off. I hope they redesign how they put the colors on this b/c it' worthless if you can't tell what color the sides are."
1,Junk,"Just like every Rubik's cube I've ever had, this one is a piece of junk. The folks at Rubik's have always made a substandard product. I had one of the knock-off brand cubes as a kid and it seemed to be much sturdier. Common problems with Rubiks' products...1) stickers fall off, and 2) the whole thing becomes loose and sub-cubes start to fall off the main cube. It's junk."
3,"Very Stiff, Unless You Get Lucky.",The Rubik's brand rubiks cube is almost always very stiff and not fun to play with unless you get lucky and get a loose one.
5,acceptable,"This cube is fine, though you should lube it with silicon to make it go faster (many people don't realize that cubes that are stiff are actually good quality-for all cubes, you're suppose to turn it for around a week and then lube it. As for complaints about stickers, the turners probably did it themselves with their fingernails.)it's addicting, and i do it a lot, with avg times of ranging from 23-29 seconds (though World avg record is around 11 secs...still practicing..)"
5,Great Rubik's Cube...,"The 3x3 Rubik's Cube is great, and is a lot of fun once you know how to solve it. My cube broke once, but only because one of my friends threw it up 200ft in the air three times until it broke. But I could fix it with superglue, it is very easy to fix. The original stickers peel off very easily after a couple weeks. Now, I have customized stickers, and the cube looks better than before. I am buying a 4x4 Rubik's Revenge, and I want to see if that cube is as good as this one."
4,great rubick's cube,"Rubick cube is great, it's solidly built, the pieces turn well, and it comes with a stand. The packaging is nicely put together so this could be easily gifted as is.i would have preferred if the .com name was not printed on the rubick's cube (makes it look weird to me)Another downer is the stickers used are already showing slight scuff marks and i have only played with this for ~3 days. it is also a fingerprint magnet which gives it a greasy feel after a while. not sure if this is a universal problem or not.but still a great rubick's cube, would recommend buying"
5,OUTSTANDING!!! :D,GREAT GIFT FOR ME!!! Specially since I know how to solve it. Seeing the minds of the uninitiated is always awsome :D
1,not the show that was advertized,"way too many shoutouts, way to little bikinis, seems bogus, needs a trailer to show what the content really is."
1,Check first,I just want to say...Check the review history of the other reviewers of the SKINOUT videos. It speaks volumes.
4,Classic Deadbolt,Classic Deadbolt sound and delivery.What can I say... you either love or hate Deadbolt and I love them.
5,Creeping Death,"I have been a fan of these guys for a few years...this album is by far the best! Imagine taking a road trip to Hell, riding in a long black '65 Oldsmobile 98. Greasey and hypnotic...Voodoobilly Man. Deranged from the trip....Insecto. On and on...this is the blueprint for pulp lifestyle and gritty humor."
5,It is THE Sound for the new millineum,"I am not a fan of alternative music, but this album knocked me out! I was hooked on this band when I heard their music on the advertisement for the X Games a year or so ago. Their sound is easy to listen to, and the lyrics are hilarious! A great band that has a lot of following across the country that I'd like to see a lot more of!"
2,Not quality I hoped for,This stick was a great price for my 13 daughter. She plays modified at her middle school. She isn't super strong but the stick cracked within days of purchase. Don't recommend this stick.
2,Poor quality,These bagpipes are made using an inferior wood in Pakistan. The bores are poorly machined. The chanter is very flat. You'll be lucky if you can get a sound out of the chanter reed because it's so hard to blow (even for me as an experienced piper). They are very difficult to bring into tune. The only thing that makes this particular set two stars is the synthetic bag actually seals OK. Best to save your money and purchase a good instrument from a reputable maker.
1,Junk!!,"I agree with the reviews above, these bagpipes are pure junk! Please dont do like I did and buy this crap! They sound flat and just plain awful...like a gaggle of brain damaged honking geese!!If you are serious about learning then you are going to have to start with a practice chanter first which will cost about $90-$120. A decent full set of pipes are going to start about $800 or more. What ever you do DONT buy this cheap junk, you will be sorry. I know I was!"
2,Sweet Dreams Movie,"I purchased this movie for my kid sisters and I was extremely disappointed in it. The characters in the movie weren't like the characters in the shorter videos like ""Strawberry Shortcake In Ice Cream Island or Cooking up Fun."" The appearance of the characters were more digital and phony. They appeared to have a latex type of face and body. They also didn't sound the same as they do in the other videos.As far as the story it wasn't bad. The sleep bug was sooooo cute. You got to see the sandman and how he makes dreams. I think if they left the characters they same as they were in the other videos I would've enjoyed it more and so would've my sisters."
1,Very Disappointing - They've Modernized The Fun Out Of It,"This didn't go over well with the wee ones in my home at all. The older Strawberry Shortcake stories had an innocent charm that was completely lacking here. The whole thing seemed crass and the story didn't have enough ideas to sustain it through feature length. When the kids walk away before the show's over, it's a bad sign."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE DIC TV SHOW,"MY DAUGHTER LOVES STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, SHE WATCHES ALL THE EPISODES FROM BEGINNING TO THE END, BUT THE MOVIE LOOKS DIFFERENT AND SHE LOOSES INTEREST...SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THE TV EPISODES..."
2,Disappointed.,"I am disappointed with this Strawberry Shortcake movie. I like the traditional animation used in the other Strawberry Shortcake DVDs much better than the computer animation (""CGI"") used in ""the Sweet Dreams Movie"". There are some good songs, and my daughter requests this movie, however, it's too long and the story doesn't keep her attention for the entire movie."
3,nice bag,"good seller, easy smooth transaction. nice bag but i noticed that the metal rings around the fabric/handles started to tear a bit the very first time i used the bag... and i didn't have the bag overstuffed by any means. it's not a huge deal to me because it really isn't that noticeable, but it remains to be seen how well the bag will continue to hold up. bottom line, a nice casual bag for the price."
5,Perfect Cruise Bag,"I am getting ready for a cruise and needed a cute bag I could take off the ship with me that could hold my towel, wristlet, water or anything else. This bag is perfect it fits all the stuff I would need and even has room left so If I buy something on sure I can put it in this bag instead of carrying a bunch of bags! I will be using this as a beach bag after cruise. I am very happy with my purchase!"
5,Great bag for price.,I would have paid more for this bag. It's very nice and seems to be good quality. Large enough for everything you need for the beach. Very happy with this purchase.
4,good size.,"This bag is a really good size for carrying to class. I also really like the color that it is. It looks simple and clean. The only thing that I don't really care for about it is taht the pockets on the sides are not only too small to put a cell phone and water bottle in, you cant really put much else in them either."
5,Another great product from Amazon,This tote bag is great! I received it so quickly I was amazed.It is just the right size for my needs. It's sturdy but lightweight. I always carry a my cell phone with me and usually a water bottle as well. There is a place for each of these items. It doesn't get better than that!I particularly like the zipper closure because I've had problems with other purses and totes that didn't completely close. Now I don't have to worry about anything falling out.Click here to order yours: [...]
3,"Nice tote, bottle holder too small","Its a nice tote bag, but the bottle holder is too small. I cannot fit my nalgene bottle (a small one) into it, too small. A small plastic water bottle would fit, but I am trying to be environmentally conscious. Needs an inside pocket too. Very roomy. Too big for a tote/pocketbook organizer also."
5,Not What I Expected...,"When I saw the first advertisement for this new children's book, I will admit that I cringed. Not being a huge Michael Bolton music fan, my initial impression was to assume that someone had given this man some crazy idea for a new market and he had jumped right in with limited knowledge or talent. I was incredibly mistaken and apologize forthrightly to him for such an ill assumption!!! I read the book at a book store one day this week and was very, very impressed! Working as a Children's Librarian, I have the opportunity to see a great deal of children's literature and I loved what I saw in this book. A charming story. Chivalry. Morality. Social responsibility to one's place of origin and background. Love and respect for people and situations. Romance intertwined. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! A book worth reading -- for all ages!"
5,The Secret of the Lost Kingdom,There is nothing wrong with this book that should keep you from reading it. It has very detailed illustrations that look real. It also has a good story. It also teaches that tour guides don't always tell you everything. It tells the story of a prince who doesn't belive that rich people should be able to take poor people's land just to make themselves richer. It is a great book as long as you don't hate stories that take place in Midievil times.
5,One of the best books ever written for childeren,"I really love Michael as a singer. I'm a fan of him since I started feeling sense of music. But I wasn't aware of his writing skills indeed. He has proved his writing skills after giving a great gift of the Secret of Lost Kingdom. The book is not infact just for childern there is something for every age, the morality, honor, truth and love. The heart touching and well illustrated story is really worth to be explored."
5,amazing Brahms recordings,"These performances are really succesful. Glenn Gould is feel very good the atmosphere of Brahms' music. Still, Glenn Gould is a Canadian pianist as you know, so he has a character of a North World man. And Brahms already is a typic a noble man came from North Europe. So, their character is nearly same and Gould is bringing vert good the Brahms' somewhere heavy, cld and stormy but somewhere lyric and warm passages. Especially in Intermezzos. Gould's another Brahms recording, Piano Quintet with Montreal String Quartet, is very good, also. And the both recordings are highly recommended."
1,What a sore DISAPPOINTMENT -- not sure what other reviewers heard!,"Wow...this 'interpretation' of Brahms was not a revelation or insightful, nor was it good. It was a travesty to Brahms and other performers that do it justice. I read the GLOWING reviews before buying it...and truly expected that STUDYING his insights into the Intermezzi would offer me new light on how to play it...on how to leave my audiences 'touched' by its nuances. Boy was I surprised when, piece after piece, I was appalled at its delivery...revolted by them. This was so bad that, trying to describe it is like reliving the trauma. I just can't -- it isn't worth very much more in typed letters.The only 'light' associated with the album was the package insert which had a colorful dialogue of Glen with Glen. This CD will end where others of its kind does: donated to Good Will."
3,Alot of work,"This book is great. It has some excellent points and research on the effectiveness and importance of sign language for babies; however, it does not tell you how much work and frustration go into the process. We tried for months with the basic signs(which were obviously more fun for us to learn than the baby), but it never quite caught on. I know it was more our fault than the author's but a little more education into the program/teaching itself instead of the signs would have been helpful."
3,"Come On, Guys, Lower Your Price","I started in on this with Kayla at 8 months. She looked at me like I was nuts for about 6 weeks. And like most kids, she signed for more, food and milk at about 6 wks. after I first introduced signs to her. I really liked the pull-out chart, but the video left me pretty cold. Boring. The book is alright, but for the price, it should be tabbed with the most common signs you use, for quick reference. I, like a lot of other reviewers, agree it is overpriced. I would expect to pay [$] for a product like this. It is a shame to be taken advantage of, especially being a new parent and having lots of extras to purchase upon starting your family. Overall, this is a good product, but a lower price would have me giving this 4 stars instead of 3."
1,"Love to Sign, but price tag not worth the material","While signing with your baby is an excellent tool and I highly recommend it and agree with all the principals introduced in this kit, the price tag is high for what you get. I found the ""directions"" overly simplistic and borderline insulting.I highly recommend all parents sign with their baby, but I feel you can get just as much from checking out an ASL book from the library... Be patient, be consistent, introduce three at first and then add when your child is ready for more. Start with the signs that make the most sense like ""more"" ""milk"" and ""eat.""The stand up ""cheat sheet"" is very nice. I think it would be easy to make your own from a good ASL book.If you need to be convinced that signing is worth your time, then maybe this kit is for you. But for those of us who are already sold on the idea, you may do better continuing on your own."
3,Video is VHS- wish it was DVD,"I haven't started using this yet as I just received it but please be aware that the video is VHS not DVD based. Not a big problem but I know many people don't have VHS players anymore. We had to re-connect and configure the entertainment system, 2 hours spent on something I really didn't have time for. Amazon lists this a a video, not VHS. There is a DVD version, I just didn't realize it at the time. DUHHHHHH!"
4,Great Book,This book is a great reference when learning to communicate with your baby. I like how there is an index so you can go right to a word you want to teach him without trying to search for it.
5,Great for bi lingual families!,"I am bilingual (Romanian, English), but my husband only speaks English, so I speak both with our daughter. As bilingual parents know, when they learn two languages at once, kids start talking as late as 3 1/2! This can make for a lot of frustration and temper tantrums when the child cannot make themselves understood. Our daughter is not speaking at 2 1/2 years. We used this system to communicate with her, cutting out some of her frustrations (and cutting out a lot of tantrums). She can make herself understood to us and she doesn't freak out becasue she is frustrated. We started when she was 9 months old, but it can be used at any age. We liked this method because it uses real American Sign Language (ASL) signs."
5,Excellent video! Exactly what I needed to get started.,"This video is perfect. I have purchased other videos and sign language books to teach my hard-of-hearing 1-year old son to communicate and this video is exactly what I was looking for. I'm starting from scratch and needed a simple video that taught the basic vocabulary (milk, eat, more, plus lots more). I wanted a video that taught several signs, not just a few. This shows parents teaching their infants in everyday situations and the infants responding. And at the end of the video it taught you several signs for about 50 common words and reviewed them A to Z. After only watching the video once, I picked up about 10 signs. And my 3-year old daughter who watched the video w/ me, was doing the signs as she watched! This is perfect not only for parents of hard-of-hearing children, but also for anyone who wants to teach their baby to communicate with sign early on."
3,Sign with your Baby,The book is informative and can be read in less than an hour. The handy chart is great. The problem is the video that comes with the kit is a VCR. The format needs to be changed to DVD. We don't even own a VCR any more!
5,An incredible learning tool,"I have used this system with both my daughters and have had incredible results both times. I think the pack is well explained, well presented and I found it very easy to use. I took things slowly as is suggested in the pack and within no time was having 'conversations' with my baby. The price does initially seem expensive but if I'd have known what this programme would've given us beforehand, I would have paid 10 times as much! Baby signing does take time and patience, but it also gives you great one to one time with your child and builds their self esteem tremendously. I hope more people try this product."
5,Love it!,"I just received the kit and I love it! I could hardly wait for my daughter (10 months) to get up from her nap and get started teaching her. This is a great resource for me, but I also got 4 books for my daughter to help reinforce the signs. Baby Signs for Mealtimes and My First Baby Signs by Linda Acredolo are the two that I prefer, but Baby's First Signs and More Baby's First Signs by Kim Votry are a nice addition as well. I truly recommend the Kit for parents who are want to communicate with their children. I just wish I had started teaching my daughter sooner (preferably around 6 months)."
5,Beyond Limits was Beyond Excellent,"Not only did this film open my eyes and provide deep insights about living with Cerebral Palsy that I never would have been exposed to under any other circumstances, but it also contained absolutely stellar visual footage that gave me a visceral feeling about what it would be like to climb mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest free-standing mountain in the world.An excellent documentary by all accounts, and one I truly enjoyed watching."
5,Great purse,My daughter love Audrey and I knew she would love this purse so that is why I bought it for her.
5,The succinct review,"To put it simply, beautiful photographs capturing the essence of NYC Art Deco, complemented by descriptions and vivid image-provoking quotes. A must-buy for any fan. The day I received it I read every word and even took notes for my upcoming NYC trip... Take note of the smaller, approx. 6x6 in. size of this book, it is not the typical coffee-table book size. My only complaint would be that it is not larger. Highly recommended and a great bargain."
4,Good Purchase,"Great Size, good quality. Does discolor a little, but quickly cleans up. Recommend this pot for one of your basics."
5,Excellent pot,Great pot by Cuisinart. convenient size. could not beat the price.well worth the money. good quality. will last a long time.
4,Nice pot,I would give this pot 5 stars but it is a little on the thin side. Other than that it is a good pot
3,Cheap Lightweight Stainless,I like and use this pan a lot even though it's a cheap and thinner pot. It works great for boiling potatoes and pasta. The only drawback is the little black spots as previous reviewers have mentioned. Think I will just stick to a competitor's tri ply stainless steel next time.
5,Beautiful and functional addition,"I used this pot for several days in a row after it arrived because I loved it so much. It's a lovely shape and is well-made. It was perfect for soup, stew, and rice. It's big enough for several servings of whatever you make. A wonderful addition!"
2,Pitted after first use,"Not Happy after making a pot of chicken soup the bottom of the pot became pitted,,,hope to follow up with Cuinart with a email to them..will keep you informed as to their action ."
5,Love This All Purpose Pan!,Where has this pan been all my life? Easy to clean (dishwasher safe also) ..heats up quickly and evenly..lid is just the right weight and is glass so you can watch what you are cooking...Great size for just about anything. I have made everything from a potfull of jambalya to corn on the cob and this pan has made me look like I know what I am doing.Perfect gift at a great price. Buy this as a nice treat for yourself...you won't be disappointed.
3,"shape good, spots bad","If you're worried about the unusual shape being a problem, forget about it. Any concern I had about the non-vertical sides making this pot tippy proved unfounded. it's as good at boiling pasta as it is simmering soup. I have, however, noticed small spots forming on the bottom (inside) of the pot. These could not be removed with barkeeper's friend. They're very small and I'm not too worried about it. But I know other reviewers have noted it and returned the item."
2,Not the same quality,"I gave someone the 14-piece Cuisinart cooking set for Christmas, then ordered these two pieces to expand the set. These pots/pans are thin and light...nowhere near the quality of the 14-piece set I purchased at Sam's Club. Very disappointed. And...they shipped across country by US Postal Service. Delivery took forever."
1,Rust spots like last reviewer,"I used this pot to make popcorn and rust spots appeared all over the bottom of the pot during the very first use, just like the last reviewer. It appears to be a very nice pot but the supposedly stainless steel certainly isn't!"
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I got this mainly to make popcorn and cook large quantities of herbs or soup. The shape is actually wonderful and I appreciate the glass lid. However, the entire pot is quite thin and it does have spots inside which are worrisome. I do like the design and if you use pots for popping corn, you might appreciate the narrow bottom and ample room for expansion offered by the sides, but it is not a quality product and the spots could actually be hazardous."
2,Quality control issues?,"I purchased this identical 5-1/2-quart Cuisinart stainless steel pot from a retail store. I filled it up with water, added salt, and turned the heat to medium high. Before the water boiled (this is the first time I used it after pre-washing), my wife and I noticed dark black spotting forming a branching crystalline pattern on the interior of the pan in the water. Small black spots also appeared randomly along the bottom. These stains could not be removed completely by washing -- we're pretty certain this is a defective pot, and will be returning the item.Made in China, like most/all of the Cuisinart Chef's Classic line nowadays."
2,Black spots after 1st use and loose lid-2nd one much better,"I just got this today, washed it and used to to boil some potatoes. Everything was great until I drained the potatoes. I noticed that the potatoes were full of black spots which weren't there when I put them in the pan. Next I saw that the inside bottom of the pan was full of black spots too.Something else that was bad was the lid. The description says ""tight fitting lid"" but it was not tight fitting at all. I'm going to try to exchange mine for a new one and see how that goes. Will up date this after I get the second one.**UPDATE**Amazon sent me a new pot and I used it A LOT for Thanksgiving cooking and had no black spots with the new pot. What I really love about this pot is that nothing has stuck so far and it washes up nicely. I still think the lid could be a tighter fit though.FYI- I was asked if I salted the water with the 1st pot and I did but I did the same thing with the 2nd one too."
2,Substandard to all of the other cuisinart products I own,"Not what I hoped. Thin, takes forever to bring water to a boil, glass lid fits loosely and rattles dangerously. Brown spots appear on bottom after first use. Disappointed."
5,Great mid sized pot.,"Great mid sized pot. Lighter in weight for us older folks, cleans easily, and cooks well. We like it and use it regularly."
1,Don't waste your time,"I used the pot for the first time tonight. After boiling a pot of water, the pan showed four pitted spots and several spots that looked like rust. I am returning it tomorrow."
4,Cuisinart All Purpose Pot,"It is definitely a multi-purpose pot as I use this pot for everything. From blanching to stir frying, to grilling. Easy to clean and my pot still looks brand new although I've had it for many months! I only gave it 4 stars because of the non vented cover. I find that cooking liquids creates a mess around the cook top."
3,strange pot,"I wanted a 5-6qt stainless steel pot with glass lid. This seemed to be perfect. Unfortunately, it's use is limited since you can only use low and slow heat. I think the capacity is too large for the small base. Be careful.....very to easy to burn food on the bottom. It's a great steamer with a separate insert."
2,"Poor quality,not thick and pot discolered after first use","This pot looks pretty but, that is it. First time I used it to make soup, pot from the inside-bottom became discolored (brown-bluish metallic color). I thought it was going to be a good pot since it is a Cuisinart. The pot is not thick from the bottom."
2,Doesn't work on induction burner,"Another reviewer said that this pot wouldn't work on an induction stove, but I couldn't imagine why it wouldn't so I decided to try it. Sadly, they were right; it won't work on my induction burner. It is a nice pot, although it is more lightweight than I expected. I am going to give it to my mother since she has an electric stove."
2,Stuck sticks,"Stuff sticks when cooking, it might be that it is a thinner metal. My Calphalon doesn't stick and I think if you're trying to stay away from cook wear with non stick cooking, go with a heavier metal. This pot is still good for making soup, but I wouldn't try to brown meat to make a stew or a pot of beans."
2,not so good as I expected,"After my first use, there were some spots which can't be clearned(Just like former users said). I hate these black spots and I can't return it...."
1,exploding glass cover - DO NOT BUY,"I was a loyal fan of Cuisinart brand until today. The glass cover exploded while my wife was boiling water to prepare pasta for my kids.1000s of sharp glass pieces all over the kitchen and she got a cut in one of her finger. I am just thankful it didn't hit her other parts of her face and body.DO NOT BUY.I am angry enough to make me run to Cuisinart HQ and scream at them until I am blue.I'll never ever again buy glass covered pan/pots/whatever....and I am blacklisting Cuisinart forever and ever and I will tell my family, relatives, friends, neighbor, or anyone else who will listen....Yes, I am very upset. Important thing is that you know that glass cover EXPLODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,handles get too hot beware,these handles get way to hot when cooking we have similar pot that does not conduct heat please reconsider when you order
4,Great value,"The Cuisinart 5 1/2 qt chef's pot is surprisingly lightweight, so I worried about its performance. But it survived a bolognese sauce simmered on the stovetop for 4 hours and produced a beautiful sauce, no burning or sticking. My husband used it to make stove-top popcorn and the oil left stains in the pot I was afraid would be permanent, but turns out he was just too lazy to scrub. The stains scrubbed right out with a blue Scotch-Brite scrub sponge (the one safe for nonstick cookware) with not too much effort. My only complaint is the lid is too loose. We air-pop popcorn right into the pot, pour on melted butter & salt, put on the lid, then shake the pot to mix it all up. The lid rattles around when you're shaking (even though you're using your thumbs to hold it in place), and I'm afraid one day I'll lose my grip and the pot, lid, and popcorn will all go flying. But for twenty dollars, it's still a great value."
4,Excellent multi pot!,"I really like how the pot looks in my kitchen. It looks like an expensive piece of cookware. It's fun to use because of it's depth, width, and overall shape. I like how the handles don't heat up. The lid's weight is perfect. It does burn a little if not careful, but that could happen in just about any stainless steel pot. I actually just bought a whole bunch of the chef's classic cookware to replace my $600 nonstick set which is still in new condition but I'm just afraid of the long term affects of non stick cooking. Here's to healthier cooking!"
1,Used when I got it,"I received a large order on one day and my friend helped me put things away so I did not see this pot up close until I pulled it out today to use it for the first time. The inside shows marks from stirring with a whisk or spoon, and there are 2 small pitted areas. It had been packaged as though new. Wouldn't you know, the return window expired Nov. 5, so I am out of luck."
1,Poor Quality and definitely not a 5 * product as the other reviews,I bought this product and wanted to rate it because this is DEFINITELY NOT a 5 * rated product as the other reviewers have given. I own a Chef's Classic Stainless 14-Piece set and the quality of this set is worse that the 14-Piece set. The attached aluminum plate in the bottom for even heating is thinner. The overall product is made of thinner stainless steel. I'm giving a 1 * to bring the overall rating down however it can be a 2* product.
5,Love it!,Just looking at the picture the pot seems to be frosted but it is shiny as the video shows. I love it! Not too big and not too small. Perfect!!
1,Does NOT work with induction stoves,"I buy stainless steel cookware use on my induction stove. This pot does NOT work on my induction stove, now I have to use it on my gas stove."
4,Exactly What I Needed,"I bought three Cuisinart pans at the same time. I decided on this one instead of a Dutch oven and am so glad I did. I can cook almost anything in this pot. The size is generous. I love the slope of the side walls -- makes it really easy to work with whatever is in the pot. It moves easily from the stovetop to the oven, which was a priority for me. All handles and lids are oven-compatible. It isn't quite as heavy as I would have hoped, thus the four stars instead of five. But, it cleans easily, cooks evenly and is a perfect all-around pot."
3,good and bad,"cooks very nicely and also very fast. thats the good.very thin pot, especially at the rim, mine actually cracked in the dishwasher. can still be used but it was only 2 weeks old. thats the bad."
3,Studs are Better,These are a little larger than I expected and they don't come with rubber backs. The STL logo on the pair I received isn't as white as the picture shows. I also ordered the studs and they are a better size and are whiter. I would suggest getting the studs if you are trying to decide between the two. The studs match the necklace well.
2,Buyer beware,"These are nice looking earrings, but the package says that they contain a chemical that is known to be cancerous in California. As a result, the package says that they are not for kids aged 12 and under. It would have been nice to know that before I bought them for my nine-year old daughter,"
1,stay away from this one,"TERRIBLE AUDIO QUALITY AND JUST A COUPLE OF INTERESTING TUNES THAT REAL HARD CORE FANS WOULD APRECIATE AND LISTEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME . THESE ARE TAPES RECOVERED FROM THE TRASH CAN. GET THE OFFICIAL ALBUMS INSTEAD, THIS IS CRAP."
4,Kindle Edition,"Got this book - Batter Up Wombat - for my 8 year old granddaughter on her Kindle. She was assigned to read it for school, but the library was all out of copies. She had called me crying on the phone, all I did was open up my browser, click it through my Amazon account, and send it to her Kindle. Within seconds I told her to dry her tears, go get her Kindle, and she was all set to go! She was so happy that she could do her homework and finish it the same night. WE LOVE OUR KINDLEs! My 3 eldest grands have them and share books all the time."
2,No Big Deal,"For God's sake, it's just a water sprayer, fairly high price for what you can get for 50% less if you shop. Not any different than a million other ones on the market. It seems to be made well, but again, this is NOT rocket science, folks."
5,"After owning for a year, this cd is still great!","I've owned this cd for over a year now and have to say that I still listen to it quite a bit. This cd just has a way of putting you in a good mood. The first three songs set a calm and wintry mood and the romantic 'fall into you' brightens things up and leads nicely into 'deeper love,' 'backbone,' and then 'hold you close' (my personal favorite of the cd.On long road trips, it never fails. I put this cd in and am overcome with a great feeling of peace. Rarely does a cd contain songs that, in the aggregate, play so perfectly off each other and create a real sense of enjoyment that transcends the music itself. And if there is any lingering doubt as to what my opinion is, I highly recommend this cd."
3,It's a'ight...,"I think of what made me buy this CD. I was in Border's one afternoon, heard a track (turned out it was ""5"") and had to know who it was. The beginning lags a bit. ""Fall Into You"" gets you warmed up and the goodness ends at track 6. I don't know what Andy Caldwell calls himself doing with ""Lectropic""...a bit too trippy, and eclectic to get into. Fuhgeddabout tracks 8-11. Don't pick up again 'til the end..."
2,Zone 5 only,"Sad to say but nearly all the plants recommended in this book are for zone 5. If you're not in zone 5, you can't use it.The pictures of plants are all pencil drawings. Useful if you want to identify something you can get close to but not helpful for seeing how the plant will look in your garden.Other wise it is a nice book."
5,"Beautiful, deep yet accessible intro to Jewish womanhood","Although this book is structured as a line-by-line analysis of the famous proverb ""Eyshes Chayil,"" (in English, ""Woman of Valor""), it actually is a fountain of practical advice on how to build your character into that of the Biblical feminine ideal. For example, Rebbetzin Heller takes the statement ""She seeks wool and flax..."" and makes of it that we must use just the right quantities of strength and kindness in raising our children, and pay attention to which is called for at any given moment. You could say men are from Mars and women are from Venus, but if you want to become a refined, dignified Venutian with a shining soul, this book is an important and beautiful guide."
4,Simple and Straightforward,"I don't know how the military does it, but somehow they are able to train people quickly and effectively whereas academia gives long-winded answers that get most students lost in derivations.Buy this book if you, like me, want to understand simple machines (levers to engines). It's straight to the point, the way I like it."
4,A book you may already have paid for,"In a sense, you probably already paid for this book. Since it was produced in 1964 by the U.S. Government, it was paid for with tax money and it generally cannot be copyrighted. (""Ever since 1895, statutory provisions have prohibited the assertion of copyright in any publication of the U.S. Government. The provisions have been only slightly modified since their enactment."")There is a free pdf version of this book online. You can search for the book by name, or go to this link (spelled out since the 'Zon does not permit certain links - and probably for good reason): bee eye tea dot el why forward-slash lowercase-ess uppercase-dee uppercase-A the-numeral-one lowercase-double-u uppercase zee.However you get a copy of the book, it is worth having."
4,How basic machines work,"Old but good. Explains things well and although the illustrations are a bit dated (so are Da Vinci's!), it is a very good and interesting book."
4,nice book,"This book is very clear, has a lot of drawings and a lot of interesting military nautical references such as cannon locks, bullets, etc. Nice book indeed."
4,Bought as a gift,This was purchased for a first year Engineering Student. A quick look through the book seems to be well written.
3,Decent,"Being a brand new GM, and a pretty new gamer (been doing it for less than a year), I felt it beneficial to get a screen for my first campaign.This is a decent screen, has lots of charts that we prefer not to memorize (cover and concealment, in particular), and is lacking others (starship combat especially). Pretty much all this has already been mentioned in other reviews.The reason it only gets three stars from me is that I am using the Expanded and Revised Rule Book, so some of the charts are outdated. Fortunately, after a few minutes of pencil marking the screen, I had it fully updated, so it wasn't a big deal. But, be aware before you buy it. If you have the Revised Core Rulebook, be sure to crosscheck before you just accept the screen. Of course, as a GM it's up to you if you prefer the Revised rules..."
5,Winning With People is a winning success formula,"Entrepreneur Ross Perot is credited with saying, ""Business is not just doing deals...it's a web of human relationships,"" and best selling author John C. Maxwell would agree. In his book Winning With People Maxwell states that relationships are the foundation of achievement and the core of a fulfilling life. Ironically, many of us wind up taking these important aspects of our lives for granted, which can be crippling since fostering healthy relationships is a critical skill that benefits every part of life - our people skills ultimately shape our success. Soundview recommends this book because Maxwell explains how anyone can improve their relational skills and interpersonal abilities. The author lists 25 ""People Principles"" that show how relationships can be created and strengthened to help us succeed in the things that matter most. The bottom line - Winning With People is a winning formula for success."
5,GREAT resource,"Winning With People is a wealth of excellent people skill principles, great for learning and for review. Many of the principles have names or titles that act as a ""hook"": an aid in remembering them.Though I don't recognize Wayne Shepherd from any particular program, he does sound like a familiar voice, and has done radio for 30-some years. The reading on this audio book is done well and enjoyable to listen to. I didn't have an expectation of hearing the author's voice, so this did not turn me off in the least.I very much enjoyed what I learned through this audio book. I found it challenging and inspiring me toward growth in this important area of relating to people. As the author states in the book: the entire world, with one exception, is made up entirely of ""others"".This review is of the abridged audio book."
3,Made me seek improvement,"This book made me seek improvement in my awareness of others. The book is not Maxwell's best, however, and often seems ""fluffy."""
2,NOT read by the author - disappointing - uninspired reading,"I am a huge fan of John Maxwell and love to listen to tapes of his books read by him. This one is NOT read by the author - it is disappointing - it is an OK but uninspired reading. When you hear that ""I"" did this or ""I"" heard that and you know that it is not John's voice then it is just not the same. The principles in the book are great and worth the read but John needs to continue doing the reading for the audios."
4,Good quality product,I've used several car adapters over the years and have found this one to be above average in durability. I would recommend this product to others.
4,Very useful for an embedded software engineer,"Whether you have to make minor adjustment to existing code - or design one starting with a blank screen - this books covers in succinct way all tasks any embedded software engineer is likely to come across.However, the author of the book tends to cut-and-paste too much of prduct specification by chip vendors."
5,A Matter of Klingons!,"Cultural education and social exploration aside, this episode rocks! It is fun to see Klingons from an outsider's perspective, true, but it's fun to see Klingons period. ""A Matter of Honor"" showcases Commander Riker and it is Riker at his very best. The only comparable Riker episodes (in quality) might be ""The Pegasus"" and ""Second Chances"". As Riker attempts to fit in with a Klingon crew as their first officer, he first must gain the crew's respect. This is no easy task for a ""weakling human"" but Riker succeeds is showing the Klingons that he is no weakling and will not be bullied. Riker learns a lot about this pround species and, in the end, the Klingons learn a bit about humans, too. The result is that both Riker and this crew of Klingon ruffians grow and mature. And when Riker returns to the Enterprise, there is a sense of understanding and camraderie between him and the Enterprise's resident Klingon, Lt. Worf.Great episode, maybe the best of season two."
3,a jumble of great and not-so-great vampire stories,"As with most short story collections 'Vampires: The Greatest Stories"" delivers an uneven assortment of stories. I personally found the stories which gave mini-lectures on conventional vampire lore to be rather dull. But there are a few fascinating stories with extra 'bite':- 'The Cookie Lady' (Philip K. Dick)- 'The Vampire of MallWorld' (S.P. Somtow)- 'Child of an Ancient City' (Tad Williams)- 'Beyond Any Measure' (Karl Edward Wagner)Of the above I found the futuristic, satiric story by Somtow to be especially creative.Bottom line: several duds interspersed with a few literary jewels. One balance it's worth picking up at a secondhand bookstore."
5,Compulsary reading material,"I read the Mame books when I was 12, after my first attempt my mother took them away, said I was too young, after a while she gave in and promised I could read them during the school vacation. Since then I've reread them every couple of years and every time it feels like a vacation. Back then in the late sixties I had the same list of difficult words as young Patrick, looked them up in the dictionary and learned a lot !!! Auntie Mame was and is a fascinating rolemodel, a deliciously open-minded free spirit and there absolutely should be more people like her in this world."
4,A Wild Ride,"Patrick Dennis had a knack for hilarity. His language was simple and purely jovial. Each chapter was a short story relating Auntie Mame's uncultivated adventure. Auntie Mame was a character that possessed great aptitude of playing totally different parts. She could be sophisticated or downright rude, mawkish or absolutely stern, malicious or wholesomely demure, depending on the situation at hand. The book doesn't need to be read from start to finish. One could pick a chapter to enjoy and would certainly get the gist of Auntie Mame's eccentricity. To read the entire volume is to take pleasure in Patrick Dennis' buoyant creativity. It is fast and entertaining."
2,Did I read the same book??,"After reading the above reviews, I wonder if I read the same book as the others. I will agree that the story was, at times, slightly funny. Other than that, I do not feel this book has stood the test of time well. Many of the social references are of course outdated, but the underlying attitudes towards class and gender are much easier to pick up on. The writing and storytelling was nothing spectacular, and the way the main character speaks of and acts towards women is appalling. Auntie Mame, if written differently, could have come across as an intelligent and warm hearted soul. Instead she is portrayed as a flighty rich woman looking for pet projects. I think this book has seen it's day in the sun, and I recommend leaving it on the shelf."
5,wonderful,Loved it! Had read it years ago and revisited the book. The word classic makes sense for describing this book.
5,great source,"advertised as used, but only had name in front cover, otherwise in excellent condition. arrived quickly."
5,Comprehensive and consciece,"I recently purchased this book to get up to speed on .NET technologies, as i'm now engaged in some new development at work that requires some Web Services and ASP.NET applications. As a long time VB programmer, i was looking for material on VB's new object-oriented language features, plus how .NET fit into the existing COM+ component model. I found all kinds of useful stuff regarding that, plus great and numerous code samples on the most important parts of the .NET Framework.All in all, well worth the buy."
3,Good but unfocused and not much depth,"This is a good introductory book to .NET, but to reiterate what has been stated in a previous review, the material is neither focused nor organized. The book lists the basics of ASP.NET and VB.NET but does not go into depth into either. Also, the material could have been organized more efficiently -- chapter 2 is over 200 pages long.The book will give you an overall understanding of the .NET platform and will help systems analysts describe the pros and cons of the technology to upper management but will not help you if you are actually writing code and solving problems."
2,"Poorly written, ""jumpy"" explanations","The author's writing style is not only extremely poor, but confusing as he uses terminologies that a LOT of beginners may not be familiar with. You'll find yourself going over to webopedia.com for explanations for a lot of his terms which he simply mentions or just glosses over.I was forced to by this text for a college course and have found much better beginning asp.net and vb.net texts since buying it."
3,General,"Over all this book is covering a lot of topics and should be good for beginner. Too much explanation of the code and stuff that's obvious for intermediate / senior levels. I did encounter couple problems. COM+ part does not go into details. The sample that I made (downloaded) for this chapter did not work. It might be the operation system problem, but I did not find any references in the book that you can't do this if you are running on WIN2000. Also, web services did not work with my components, again, no references in the book what do you do if web service looks inaccessible."
2,Not for begginers to Microsoft programming,"I am an experienced HTML, PHP and Javascript developper.I recenctly decided I would like to pick up VB.net for web development and maybe pass 70-305. I just finished VB.net Step-by-Step and was pretty happy.I bought this book based on the reviews and I have to say I am frustrated and disappointed.First off, most of the book is spent making console applications, not web applications.Second, there are no clear tutorials or labs that allow you to practice or apply what you have learned. Lots of code snippets and incomplete programs that aren't terribly clear. Lots of theory, not much applicationFinally, the author assumes knowledge that hasn't been demonstrated in the book to date when giving examples or using terminology. For someone who is unfamiliar with the MS programming world, it can very confusing.All in all I'm not impressed."
1,I hated this book.,"I could not stand to read this book. Either the chapter was too basic or it was irrelevant to me. The author gives a lot of code samples without showing the output. I skimmed over most of the book without reading much of it at all. There was only 1 chapter in the entire book that was good, and that was the chapter on ado.net. I am getting rid of this book as soon as possible. If you have ever worked with VB before, save your money and buy something else."
5,I was inspired to return to my art,"I purchased this video and was so inspired by the charming older lady with such zest for life that I immediately ordered 5 for friends. It's that kind of video! The woman is very interesting, her art is amazing, she plays drums, she dances this strange kind of Japanese dance and draws and paints about it. My gosh, and what's more, she lives in Taos, New Mexico....I could see and 'feel' that incredible light in many scenes. My artist-self awakened with new energy and confidence. I am inspired to be true to making art, no matter what! Thanks Butterfly Woman!"
2,Not all it is cracked up to be,Uses lots of ink. Still can't get envelopes to feed properly. Should have gotten another Canon.
1,Don't Buy This Printer,"When my R800 works it's awesome, but that's rarely the case. Wether it's having to change the ink cartridges every other day or the paper jamming or just not loading for 90% of the print jobs. Very frustrating printer to own."
1,buy a house instead,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I HATE this printer. Which is unfortunate, because it prints beautiful photos... once in a while. If you don't mind replacing three cartridges every time you want to print two photos, then you might not mind this printer as much as I do. At nearly $20 a cartridge, I've had enough..."
1,Over a Month Later and Still Can't Print CDs,"I haven't been able to get the Print CD capability to work on my printer yet, which is the entire reason I bought it in the first place. I've been talking to Epson technical support, but they can't seem to figure it out. I'm waiting for another CD tray to arrive to see if that's the problem, but it's been over a week now. Meanwhile, my project is on hold because I can't print the CDs."
1,Epson Stylus Photo R800 Inkjet Printer,"Broke down out of warranty, cost another $105 to find out that it could not be fixed. Junked it."
1,The most expensive printer you will ever own.,"Most manufacturers sell you a printer cheap and then they gig you on the ink cartridges. Epson charges you a lot for a printer that only does a fair job of printing photos then they raise the ink gigging to a high art form. It not only goes through ink like water goes over Niagara but heaven forbid the heads need cleaning or the jets get clogged. They will tell you to run the head cleaning routine at least three times, which uses up a ton of your expensive ink. Then if that doesn't work they tell you to put in new cartridges and do it three more times. Only then, after you have gone through enough ink to buy a new printer, do they tell you to get it serviced.Do yourself a huge favor and buy a different printer. We have a HP PhotoSmart 2710 that does a much better job printing photos, does a good job scanning photos, is wireless, reasonable with ink and does a whole lot more besides."
4,I'm in love!,I have owned many printers...but I have to say I love this printer the best so far. It's so versatile. The prints on Epson photo glossy paper look like they just came from the lab. I'm still amazed after two weeks.Prints on coated inkjet CDs are a bit under saturated. Also if you want the best quality and water proof photos you have to use Epson paper.This is a wonderful printer for photo enthusiasts and the geek who wants the novelty of printing on CDs. However if you do not intend to print on a regular basis do not buy this printer. The pigmented ink will clog the head with infrequent use.I would give it five stars if it were a bit faster. I still love it though.
1,Not what it seems,"I was using an Epson 890 for a couple of years and began to run into paper handling problems. Believing I had worn it out I was attracted to the R800 as a quality replacement.How very frustrating to find that, after a few months of use, this expensive inkjet can only print on glossy photo paper and basic 80/100gsm matt stock. It will not handle matt art papers of any substantial thickness, will not feed matt greetings cards and is a huge disappointment. Epson Support are very unhelpful, just saying you must use Epson papers which leaves you with very limited possibilties.I bought this printer because it has the potential to produce sunlight resistant prints from original art works but its paper handing problems negate this possibilty. It also guzzles hard to find and very expensive inks at an alarming rate.At this price and after all these years of development I expect perfection from Epson but I find my $60 Canon is a dream to use compared with the R800"
1,Heads never stay clear,"The printer worked well for about a year. Great pictures. Then the heads started clogging. It would take a few cycles of head cleaning that seemed to use up half a cartridge worth of ink (on all 7 of the cartridges). So it got to a point where printing 3 or 4 copies between each set of clianing cycles for a few times might give you a one good quality print out of 10 tries. The only problem is it took you a couple of hours and at least $50 of ink and paper. We now just use it to print black and white docs. It does a great job at this because we print enough to keep the black heads clear. I have read a few reviews on Epson high-end printers where they say they are really reliable, but they also use them daily. If we had put a full 8X10 color photo through this printer every day, maybe it would have ended up being OK.Another minor point: Epson has not got around to making available a 64-bit driver that can use the firewire port."
2,Brace yourself for ink cartridge shock...,"Supplies for the R800 are pricey. $15-$18 for OEM cartridges, and they don't last very long. There are 8, and you'll need 2 or 3 sets of replacements handy to continue working. Most retailers to not carry these specialized cartridges, and you'll be stuck buying 3rd party, or direct from Epson."
2,Too many operational issues,"This printer prints an excellent print, but there are just too many frustrating issues inherent in it's operation; I have never had so many ""Media Loaded Incorrectly"" warnings come up to stop my printing. Loading paper in this machine is not rocket science, yet it seems that this printer has trouble with this function. The ink warning lights go on after a few prints, despite the fact that there is plenty of ink in the cartridges. Epson software leaves much to be desired.Nice results, but at a high price in user frustration."
2,I'm so disappointed,"I replaced my old EPSON Stylus 600 with the R800 because I thought it was of greater quality. Actually, the results are terrible: prints are too dark and the colour changes. I've tried everything to make prints that look just as the photos on my screen, but nothing works. I've downloaded new drives, I've cancelled ""color management"", I've used ""ColorSync""... My old printer still prints better."
1,Very Dark Prints,"Bought this printer hoping it would give clear wonderful pictures. WRONG! What a dissappointment! The pictures come out dark! Had to get Adobe 7.0 to print pictures, still dark, went on Epson web site and downloaded the improved program because of dark pictures, Still DARK. I have to lighten all my pictures by 45% just to get a decent picture. NEVER AGAIN! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRINTER!"
1,Where did the COLOR ink go?? EPSON IS GARBAGE,"I am not sure if this is the correct model, but I have an Epson and I am very frustrated with it. It would not print a text document because the color was gone. So I went and bought 3 new color cartridges. The I made my printer settings to print in black and white only. Three months later my color ink has magically disapeared. So instead f buying more useless color ink I never use, I will buy a new printer. I will definatley NEVER buy or recomend an Epson."
2,Tempermental. Good standard glossies but not spectacular. Other problems as well.,"I bought this printer for commercial purposes and now it sits unused. The printer does not print heavyweight stock (notecard) or multiples well. Inks are too expensive to make a commerical project pay. If you want to buy substitute inks that are cheaper than Epson's stay away from all but especially those from X-print and the online dealer Clickinks. No support from them at all and the cartridges print fewer pages than Epson's.Epson has since come out with the R1800, but the experience with this one has put me on hold for further Epson printers. Buy a cable (USB) when you buy this printer if you do, because a cable doesn't come with it."
1,The Ferrari of Printers,"One star for the Ferrari of Printers? Yep, it's capable of amazing print quality as long as you use Epson's most expensive paper and ink, you have infinite patience, and you are intimately familiar with the difference between ICC, ICM, sRGB versus ARGB, and of course the various Gamma options you must select for each print. Being a Ferrari, I just printed some pictures for my Mom and I had to reload the (expensive) Epson paper no less than 13 times to get the one print I needed. For me, it's much less of trial to upload pictures to an online service for great quality pictures, than it is to buy ink at $130 a pop and spend an afternoon screaming at my printer, which by the way thinks that human flesh is actually orange tinted. Before you buy this printer, you should really try an online print service-or even a custom lab. I did get a great quality print on the fourteenth try, thanks mostly to Qimage."
5,food for thought,"As a photographer and printer from the old school, I know that you can't open a box, plug in the contents and expect instant gratification (this is for the critics of the R800). Maybe I'm speaking out of turn since I haven't purchased a unit as of yet.However, I have used Epson printers in the past. And like the old days of film and filters the first thing you did before printing was to make yourself a SHIRLEY. What's a Shirley? A starting point for true color (look it up). There's a variance in all the eliments - paper, ink, exposure, etc. The quality of the print is in the hands of the beholder, and the variance in their vision."
5,Best desktop sized photo printer,"This is a serious, professional quality photo printer in 8.5x11 size - sized for a home desktop. That's something nobody else makes, and since the R800 went out of production nothing in this category is available anymore. This printer uses 8 pigment (not dye - pigment is better) inks with 200 year estimated life and the ""gloss optimizer"" for best quality glossy printing. These technologies are now reserved for the large, expensive 13x19 and larger printers.It blows away the current 8.5x11 photo printers (the Photosmarts, Artisans, Styluses, etc.)."
5,Outstanding with instant gratification!,"I quickly rationalized this purchase when I grew disappointed with my local lab processing. I had asked that they not modify my digital photos and yet they continue to make their own corrections. If you own a digital SLR and a good image editing program you can pump out some outstanding prints that rival your local lab. Epson has announced a newer version of this printer that will allow for even larger prints than 8X10, if it performs as well as the R800, count me in!"
2,"Great at first, but...","I have had this printer for a couple of years. For a while it produced nice prints, although it did have some trouble feeding paper. However the print heads are now clogged and won't print properly even after loading brand new ink cartridges and running multiple cleaning cycles. All printouts have streaks and gaps and I have to print three or four pages just to get one good copy. And get this - every time you run a cleaning cycle on this printer it uses up about 10% of the ink in EVERY cartridge. It costs about $100 to replace all the cartridges, so every time you do a cleaning cycle it costs you $10! Maybe you will have better luck than I did, but I do not recommend this printer."
3,One significant disappointing feature,"Half the reason I bought this printer was to print out my music CD projects. BUT, you cannot (as far as I can tell) use other labeling programs besides the supplied Epson one. OK, not that big a deal EXCEPT the Epson program will not import the song titles from a CD Text encoded disc (or from the internet via the CCDB). So am I supposed to actually TYPE all these song titles into the CD? Come on, Epson, get with the program.I've only had the printer one day, so am still evaluating. It does appear to make very good prints on Epson Premium Glossy paper. The print quality on the TDK CDRs I bought is a washed out look. I'm trying to find out how to get more color there (Epson does say they don't pump as much ink onto the CDRs as the printer would onto regular paper due to absorption problems I assume).Just my initial cut/thoughts on this printer."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in my new Epson R800. My Epson Color Stylus 900 printed better pictures. This model leaves a film over the pictures even when using the photo glossy paper. The pictures have a dull appearance to them rather than a nice glossy crisp print. Also, it eats ink like candy and each cartridge, (there are 8 of them) costs around $14 - $15 apiece depending on where you purchase them. I wish I had my Stylus 900 back however, it served me well for 7 years. Dixie"
1,No more Epson,1. after only three weeks print pause the print-head was blocked2. Its only wasting the time to clean a printing-head3. Its expensive and worst Service I ever saw4. After all nervous breakdown I learn something: NO MORE EPSON!!!
2,Hammer time for this printer,"This printer produces very good prints, when it actually works. I've gotten far too many ""media not loaded correctly"" messages. The amount of wasted time this machine has cost me is beyond the purchase price by now. Epson's support is non-existent or just on a long vacation. Awful. Stay away."
4,Best printer I've had yet,"After my Epson 960 went south on me after less than one year, I called Epson and they talked me into an exchange for this printer (for an additional $150 which I thought was a good bargain) This printer is outstanding. Although the best prints come from Epson papers, I've found equally good prints from Staples brand glossy papers and much less expensive. My two complaints are mediocre quality of prints on printable CDs and the cost of inks. I tried using generic inks on my Epson 960 and I think that's what damaged the printer so now I am sticking to only Epson inks. I've subsequently found out that, that's how Epson makes their money....not by the cost of printers but by the cost of their inks. I have already purchased enough ink for the R800 to buy 3 printers. Such a ripoff!"
2,Pretty pictures for a pretty penny!,"Great output that will output you to the poor house. Use it only for high quality photo output that you must have right now! But don't throw away your old b&w laser printer. With the high cost and short life of these Epson ink cartridges, you don't want to use this device as a utility printer for simple b&w output. And having more cartridges DOESN'T make it less expensive. But it is a good machine for high-cost high-quality output."
5,Very pleased,"I am very pleased with my Epson R800. This is my second Epson and I am retiring my HP photo printer for this one. I have had it for about 3 weeks and it is wonderful. Prints are gorgeous, very fast with printing documents and extremely quiet. My only problem is I cannot get it to properly print envelopes (#10). Could someone who owns this printer be of assistance? Other than that, it is a great printer."
5,Wow...,"This song is definitely the best since a long time. I'm sure that even if it cost ten times the price, people would still get it... Great job, R Kelly and Celine Dion..."
3,i'm an angel,"They use this word in a way that i like very much. The song is so sensitive,you know sometimes you don't like an artist but after you listenend one of is song and you keep thinking about this artist because of the song,that what's happend to me.I love this song ,i feel tought by it and i think very much (Celine,Rkelly) to singing it."
1,celine living out her jungle fever fantasies,I hate this song come on celine let it out we know you like black men hahahaha kelly'sd just the freak you secretly desire.
2,Reverberating repetitions,It's hard to see this stoned early electronica as much more than an intriguing opening act for someone like Kraftwerk; even with its textural zest there is just too much droning negative space to keep the few lengthy tracks sounding more than exercises in sequencing.
5,One of the best,This is one of the best albums by Neuronium. My favorite is Digital Dream. Is this available anywhere?
2,Disappointed and in pain!,"I wouldn't recommend purchasing this shaver... I bought it because I have very coarse hair and shaving just leads to itching and ingrowns. I was hoping this product would at least allow me to clean up a bit. But it's very noisy, makes your hand numb with the vibrations, doesn't trim very well, and if you're not careful with the angle at which you're holding it, it will nip your skin- NOT FUN! I'm terrified to try using this thing again."
2,Reconsidered after second chance,"Ok, I would change this to a four star review if I could. I used this item again the other day after noticing it in my bathroom drawer. It worked well and was easy to use. Please Amazon, let me change the number of stars!!"
1,Not good for bikini,This actually made me bleed. It is not a good item to use on your bikini area. Waste of $$$
2,I love his bach,"I highly recommend Goulds Bach. I have everything but the inventions and concerts and they are fantastic. He adds drama to Bach. But whan it comes to Beethoven, this composer is already extremely dramatic. Gould is not adding drama as he does with Bach but he is substituting his own drama for Ludwig's. I prefer Lud's."
2,Not so much to write home about,"I found this book to be very sparse in terms of information, and it looked more like a teen magazine without the catchy, interesting content."
5,Bring It Back,"Outcasts was an interesting show that was getting better and better as the season progressed. With so much unimaginative and mediocre programming on TV it's hard to believe a show like this was cancelled so prematurely. I'd love to see it brought back or re-imagined somehow. The premise is too good to waste, and what's not to like about a post-apocalyptic sci-fi show?"
3,"Well, its ok so far","Have only seen the first episode so far. Seems ok. Basically, Earth is in the dumpster, and a struggling colony is trying to make a go of it. I was a little worried it was going to be like Moonbase 3 - one of the absolute worst British Sci-Fi shows I ever saw. Basically, labor unions complaining in space -uhg. Much better than that - at least there is some action. Sorry to hear it only lasts 8 shows."
5,What an eye-opening account of Navy Aviation,"I just HAD to read this book after seeing all of the reviews: how could they be so disparate? Evidently, the same community which basically forced the author out of the Navy has attempted yet another campaign to discredit her. I highly recommend this book to anyone thinking about joining the naval aviation community, and particularly to anyone thinking about marrying a pilot. It's obvious that the Navy STILL hasn't learned anything from Tailhook. The heinous stories that the author describes are on-going even now in port calls around the world. This book should be an eye-opener to Washington. The Navy lost an intelligent and motivated patriot when it let Missy go. Read about it for yourself."
5,Thank you for telling it like it is.,Thank you Missy for telling the world your story. As a women aviator in the Air Force I feel like you took the words right out of my mouth. Wow! All women interested in military aviation need to read your book to better prepare them for what they are up against. I only hope it doesn't discourage future women from trying to obtain their goals. Go Hokies!
5,Boys won't share their toys with girls,"I read with amazement on how the Navy treated one of their best and brightest. Missy Cummings is a true-American and her book made me proud as an American that people like this still exist.I can only pity both the men and women who tried in vain, to smear this great patriot.This is an awe inspiring story - a must read.Missy, You go girl!"
1,One sided,"Seldom have I ever read a book that is so one-sided. ""All their fault"" mentality. I was looking forward to this book, but its a dissapointment. Its a non mea culpa. Its sad to see a person who can't come to grips with their failure. We read daily in the news how women are serving successfully in the US Air Force and US Navy. Many have served in combat. Including Miss Cummings contemporaries. Don't get me wrong, the book reads well, but its more like fiction than fact.As a woman in corporate America, I have faced virulent sexism. But when I see women succeed where other's fail, its hard to chaulk it up simply to sexism.This book was a dissapointment because it was so lopsided."
1,A Terrible Pilot that won't take accountability,"The real truth to Missy Cummings is she was a terrible pilot that couldn't hack the program. She was dangerous and was rightfully washed out. Now here is the interesting part...when most people get washed out they go away. Not Missy, she goes to her senators and congressmen and accuse sexual harassment. She gets reinstated due to her senators and washes out again due to her utter incompetence. Her response??? This time she goes out and writes a book on how everyone was unfair to just her. Interesting that there are plenty of other females that made it through just fine and are very good pilots. It must be the conspiracy of the Navy that wanted poor Missy out. Don't waste your time with this book, it's full of nothing but lies."
1,If only it were true...,"Wow- how to start this...I don't want everyone to stop reading as soon as I point out that I am a woman in a traditionally male-dominated field myself, and know what it can be like. However, this is a case of a woman being as qualified, or, as is frequently the case, more qualified. Missy Cummings was a danger to herself and others. The strings pilled to keep her flying as some sort of proof that women can do it are astonishing and disgusting. There are women pilots out there who don't have to be babysat to keep them form flying into the ground. Missy just isn't one of them."
1,Waaaaa,"Don't waste your money on this book. The title of this book should be ""Waaa"" or ""It's not my fault"". I knew this particular female in the Navy personally. I know quite a large number of people who feel the same way about this person.Don't get me wrong....I encourage the recruiting of female aviators in the Navy. I know a few that have performed well and are shown due respect from their male peer group. This particular female is not one of them. She cannot accept failure or admit fault to any degree to the point where she probably needs to seek medical help or therapy."
1,Watered Down,"I agree with other users about the integrity of this product: it's not 100% Kerastase. I am a long-time user of Kerastase products in the Oleo Curl line, and have been using the Oleo Fusion conditioner for years. After purchasing this product from this seller, I believe that it is a very watered down version of Oleo Fusion. It's not nearly the same potency as I have received from salons or have purchased abroad. It's as though the company purchased this product in bulk then watered down each container in order to get a better profit. Be advised that the price is indeed too good to be true."
3,Crap,"If you'd like to have the closest to possible authentic Kerastase product, I would suggest that you get it directly from the salon. I even noticed that the quality of the product purchased from the salon seemed even better than if you bought it from the website.......strange. Anyways, its a good product IF you get the right thing. I'm really sorry for you guys who got jipped*"
4,Beginner's guide,"As a beginner to shisha and sadi thread embroidery, I found this book very useful. The explaination for each of these meduims was very useful as was the guide for embroidering with the shisha and sewing with the sadi thread which also included the tools necessary to use for both. The techniques shown for each are very good as are the projects provided for both. I would recommend this book to any one not familiar with the use of these two wonderful embellishments to the world of sewing."
4,"nice case, fails to be perfect.","I bought this case for the 6131 phone, having been using it already, it seems to be real leather and it's nice to know the phone is protected, nevertheless, it seems that this was not meant for nokia 6131 phones, the package says that the case will stretch, well, no matter how much I tried, the top part leaves a tiny portion of the screen out, also, the camera will be blocked by the case with phone open. It was a tight fit but I finally managed to do it.I'm giving it 4 stars because it does what it says, protect the phone and look fine, almost luxury...and because of nokia's hard to find overpriced original accesories."
5,Highly recommended,"Surviving Modern Medicine was given to me when it was first published in 1998. I read the first chapters; since I did not have a particular medical problem, I did not feel the need to finish the book.Time passed and someone very dear to me raised a question concerning what to do in the case of serious illness of a loved one. I immediately referred to Surviving Modern Medicine and was able to share some of the ideas discussed by Clarke and Evans. In the end I bought the book for my friend.This book is a resource for us baby boomers who, believing ourselves to be immortal, will delay facing the issues of age and death. Clarke and Evans address these important subjects with candor and compassion. I recommend this book to anyone who is beyond the great divide - over 50."
1,Don't Believe The Hype,"This is by far the worst cell phone that I've ever owned. I had a Qualcomm 1920 in the late 90's that's battery lasted longer than this one. You can't navigate hotmail, or link it up to Outlook on it.You would think such an advanced phone would have no problems sending picture mail; guess again. There are Vegas odds on whether or not they will send. Just recently, my phone decided to lose my yahoo account, and forget how to log on to the internet. And when I try to send picture messages now; I get an 'Unable To Connect' message. I can't wait to get a new phone so I can smash this one to pieces.It makes me miss my Razr"
3,Great Phone - Windows Mobile Is Kind Of Crummy,"The phone is gorgeous, and the buttons are easy to type on. The only downside of this device is the Windows software. It sort of reminds me of Windows 1998 - limited error messages and a very buggy version of Internet Explorer."
1,Don't buy,"Just got it asked for a unlocked phone. It as AT&T on it. Did what it said charge up the batter, put in my sim card and it asked for a unlocked code number. For what i asked for it to be unlocked? has this happen to anyone besides me?"
4,"Great Phone, Great Service","After an initial set back of having the wrong phone delivered... The device works great, and the Customer Service was excellent, they immediately sorted everything out..."
3,Excellent and terrible!,"In some ways, it's a great phone - the screen is BEAUTIFUL and the storage of films and audio are great. But those are extras - in what you basically need, it often is terrible.To search a name, I push the CONTACTS button. If I want ""TODD"" I used to hit ""T"" and my old phones would all jump to the T section. On this phone, it jumps to the first name with a T anywhere in it! Like sTeve or lesTer! Argh.When I get a call from a new number, I push SAVE and store a name next to it. When you go look in your contacts, the name is often NOT there. It may appear in the contacts 3 or 4 minutes later (huh?!?) or not at all. Psycho!There are various ways to configure the front homescreen, but you OUGHT to be able to put what you want on there - this is software, dumb software - and there should be more control."
1,Horrible phone: freezes up all the time,"This is just a horrible phone; it freezes up all the time, whether you are entering someone's number or you are checking email. Even a reset doesn't work -- I have to pull the battery out to reset. I can't change the options of one of the email accounts I created and can't delete it. There are so many other such gotchas -- I will never buy a Windows Mobile phone again and highly recommend against a Blackjack."
1,NOT Unlocked its Locked,"I haven't used the phone but was about to buy it,but for some reason I checked the sellers who are selling it used for $99 and I realized on their description they state that the phone is Not unlocked, although the title is for an (Unlocked phone) so I thought you may want to be careful, again if the prices is too good to be true then its not true:) of course the sellers morals are questionable in my opinion so I decided not to buy it."
2,KEYBOARD is too small,It's virtually impossible to key in telephone numbers correctly. The numbers are spread arbitrarily around the keyboard.
4,Good phone,"I had a RAZR before this, so its a huge improvement. The screen is very vibrant and I love having a full keyboard. I read the online manual from samsung and very quickly learned how to use most of the phone features.Pros- Excellent screen.very fast internet in 3G areasfull keyboard for quick textingeasy navigationconsbattery life with regular batterysometimes freezes upcant make the phone ring and vibrate (bad for noisy places)annoying confirmation screen after sending text messagesannoying at&t; startup (flying whooshing fiery balls, very loud)"
5,Love it!,"I have had the BlackJack for over 1 month now. I love it. I think that it's a great smartphone. Yes, it does lack some battery power but they give you a second battery for that. I don't find it to much of a pain to swap out the batter in the afternoon. I think I would suggest getting some kind of screen protectors to put over the screen to prevent scratching."
3,okkk,"the phone came on time, shipping was quick, but the seller had told me the product was brand new, when in fact it definitely was used for a short while, also i do believe the phone had gotten wet also before being sold, i dont think i will be buying anymore electronics online, you cant trust that they'll be in the best shape when you get them"
3,Good phone with low battery life,"I've had this for a few months now and must say that overall, this is a good phone. It was easy to configure gmail and google maps. I'm surprised, however, that hotmail and messenger are not included in the software. I believe you might need to buy extra software if you want to use that (or maybe get the new version with the new version of windows mobile). Below are some comments on this phone:PROS: sharp screen, good voice quality, qwety keyboard, 3G, able to sync with outlook server.CONS: battery life (needs to be charged EVERY day), quality of pictures is not that great (although I rarely use the camera), no standard plug for headphones, you need to reboot every so often because weird things will happen (Windows problems, bluetooth will stop working, the time will get messed up, it will just hang)."
1,Disappointing SmartPhone,"I had to return my BlackJack to AT&T warranty center three times! It froze a lot even though I frequently stopped programs using the task manager. I also reset it several times, but it never stopped freezing. The volume is too low, and I missed calls. Even at the highest volume setting, it's difficult to hear. The phone also becomes very hot when you are holding the handset to your ear. It's best to use the bluetooth device. I was very disappointed with the phone. At&T replaced my phone with a Blackberry Pearl."
3,"Warning - Blackjack does not run Java Apps (like Google Maps, Google Mail) properly","I have a Blackjack, and would echo the comments of the other reviewers that it is in most respects an excellent phone - although having coming from the Treo / Palm world, the Windows Mobile UI seems hard to use and confusing.I just want to make clear, however, that this phone doesn't run Java based Google mobile apps like Gmail or Google Local well, and constantly asks for permission to connect. If you care about running Java apps like this which require a data connection, then until Cingular fixes this problem, this phone is not for you."
2,"Blackjack- looks cool, but doesn't compare","I convinced my husband who is a blackberry owner that I wanted the cooler phone and it was worth $200. The size (thinness) is great- fits into my backpocket or side pocket without anyone knowing.The issues with the phone have been it's very difficult to get it set up the right way and the battery does not hold very long. Sure you get a new battery, but when you are on a conference call or on your way somewhere in the car, it's not that easy to change. I have been charging with the ligher charger in the car and switching battery 1/2 day through. I use it a lot for email- but truly only make 3-5 calls a day on it. The email sucks up the energy everytime it syncs.Keyboard is tight, but not an issue for me. Cool features- camera, etc. If you use them it's worth it- if not- get a blackberry."
4,Does any body know if I cancel the PDA service,"Does anybody know if I cancel the PDA service (but keep the voice service) after a few months, will there be any penalties? I am interested in trying the PDA service but not sure if I will want to keep it."
4,Love it,"The Blackjack is very cute and slim. I'm a girl so i like those features. I love that it comes with an extra battery. But because that extra battery is larger it also has an extra cover which makes the phone a bit bigger from the back. It's not compatible with macs which totally sucks. I really really love it cuz i can get my e-mail in there and i never had that before so i'm in awe! It has all these cool features but i honestly dont use them. For example:it has like videos that you can watch thru the internet, also internet music and some other things that i honestly don't use but it's still very cute!overall i recomend this to GIRLS!!!!! Just cuz it's slim and it's fun to text on. & I know that ppl love to text. so go on ahead and buy it."
2,Not sure what to think of this movie.,"This movie really grated on me while i was watching it. I tried to feel so much compassion for Rockets but the movie made me feel none. I love Steve Buscemi and Wilem Dafoe and even there love for this man couldn't get me to care. I enjoyed this movie but overall i think the message they were trying to get across never showed up to me. The whole movie i would be thinking why are these people friends with him. As much of a wonderful man i am sure Rockets was this movie does not show it and at the end it leaves you with a overall ""what the hell?!?!?!?!?!"" kind of feeling. So i honestly would and have told people to see this movie but i always warn them that they will probably hate it and me for telling them to watch it."
1,Plain bad writing makes this romance novel a real dud,"I was so looking forward to enjoying my time on maternity leave with a good sexy romance novel...and this book just could not deliver on any level. In fact, I am tempted to quit reading reviews in order to determine which books to buy since the reviews were quite fine for this novel...and I am not sure how these reviewers could possibly be talking about the same book that I tried to read. The sexy scenes were so poorly written and constructed that they could not thrill a love-starved teenager let alone a more mature audience. Two thumbs down for this one and I will not be attempting her other novels either."
2,Not what I expected,"Like a previous reviewer I was very disappointed in this book.Maybe if I have never read other books of this genre I wouldhave found it stimulating. But, as a reader of romance novelsfor many years there was nothing new here."
3,Good for the price,"No question that Opteka 500 mm gave the better image for the price. For young birdwatchers (without rich parents) it is a tool to have. It also allow good shots with poor light conditions. But if you are trying to buy this product from Europe, you better look for a very good friend in USA, otherwise you can't use your one as shipping address."
3,didn't fit my d3100,bought it to take nature pictures and animal pictures. got it and was excited to try it. when i put it on my D3100 the camera said no lens was connected to camera. checked other boxes and found one filter cracked. was returned and refund was promptly taken care of
1,Do not purchase OPTEKA products,"I have purchased a 500mm- 1000mm opteka lens for $95 and failed to read reviews before purchase. Do not purchase Opteka equipment. You will be very dissapointed after arrival of parcel to find that you could have waited a few more paychecks to save the money for REAL LENS. I am very serious. If I had just been patient and waited another week, I could have had a 35mm Panasonic. Now I am stuck with the seller of Opteka Lenses not responding to my request for return and have been forced to file a claim with amazon. DO NOT PURCHASE OPTEKA EQUIPMENT!!! WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT PAYCHECK AND BUY A REAL LENS!!!!!!!!!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Lens works about like you would expect. In no way does it come close to a Nikon lens with VR. That being said, I can't wait to shoot at the coast of Monterey using a tripod. The pics clean up nicely with Picasa (free download)...using the ""I feel lucky"" edit option for batch photos. For the cost, it's a good toy."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This lens is a great buy if you want to go on the cheap. But, in general, I'd say save the money for a decent lens for your camera. I have the Nikon D40x, and I wish I'd waited to buy a real Nikon lens with autofocus and Vibration Reduction.For the Opteka 500mm you need a lot of light (a lot of light). You also need a stable platform (tri- or monopod) and patience. It takes time and energy to make this lens work right and produce clear images. If you're a weekend birder who wants to get closer, hold out for a better lens or be prepared to get a lot of blurry images for every decent one."
1,First Hubble Mirror,"The lens is like the very first Hubble photos out of focus. I had to shoot every thing with manual settings on A Nikon D40X (all exposures were trial and error). As with the first mirror for the Hubble Telescope - I think that the mirror is a fraction off, making it out of focus no matter how accurate your camera is. I have taken far superior photos with a fixed lens Digital Zoom Camera. I've been in photography for over thirty years and can truthfully say this is the worst lens ever purchased."
2,500mm f/8 Not for beninners,"I use my D40 mostly for school pictures football, band, etc. It did not fit my needs. Night games I can not use it. Trying to follow the action I could not use it. There were no instructions on what settings to use it on had to play with it for about 3 days. However it is a fine lens for still life. I am not a pro just a regular guy who wants some close up of his kids at events. Guess I will have to try a 2x converter. I am not advanced enough for this yet."
1,You get what you pay for,"I thought this looked like a great deal. 500mm lens for under a $100. All the reviews I read were favorable. So now I realize that those reviewers either work for Opteka, the seller, or are on serious drugs! This lens **SUCKS**! I can't begin to say all the things wrong with it. The attachment ring does not always stay on, it does not work that well with the D70, you must have a ton of light (I know it is f8, but acts like it is f22 instead), does not do color well, and all around SUCKS. Did I mention that this lens SUCKS?!! I would return it, but they charge a 15% restocking fee plus shipping fee, so I would be lucky to get half my money back. Lesson learned: always try out a lens before you buy it. And make sure it does not SUCK! Avoid this lens like the plague and stick to Nikon or Sigma."
2,You get what you pay for,"Of course I didn't expect the same kind of performance as a $$$$ Nikkor lens would give me. So I wasn't disappointed.But I had hoped for better results -- I put it on a tripod to avoid vibration focusssed as exactly as possible onto a high-contrast banner at a race track. But still I never could a sharp edge from that banner.Using the same setup & procedure with a different lens, sharpness jumped a lot. Price of that lens also jumped a lot.I cannot recommend it on D80 and lower as this is a non-CPU lens and metering will not work so it is 100% manual and try & error. The D200 can meter in ""M"" mode."
5,Amazing Lens!,"For about $100, this is an amazing lens! It is probably not for everybody, because it takes a little figuring out to make it work, but for the money it is a great buy. The aperture is fixed so the camera has to be set to ""Manual"" mode to operate. The only adjustment left for controlling exposure is the shutter speed. At 1/2000th on a sunny day, camera shake is not really a problem. I have been able to take acceptable shots without a tripod in bright sunlight. Fun lens!"
3,A bad idea for an update,"I had the fifth edition and thought it would be nice to be up-to-date for my next holiday with this 7th edition. That proved to be a mistake.LP has added a lot of countries (the Baltics, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Moscow and Petersburg) without adding pages. As a consequence the information about the other countries has been reduced. For example Albania went from 40 to 25 pages.So if you don't have the guide I can still recommend it because I generally like LP. But if you have an older edition you should think twice about upgrading."
2,Amon Duul - 'Airs On A Shoestring:The Best Of Amon Duul' (Thunderbolt),"I sure wish that so many compilation CD releases would stop putting 'The Best Of...' in their title to simply boost CD sales.This is in NO WAY WHATSOEVER a best of compilation.Should be titled 'Odds&Ends Of Amon Duul'.Only two AD/AD II actual members appear on this effort as it is,bassist Dave Anderson and guitarist John Weinzerel.Only two tracks here that I sort of liked were ""Hymm For The Hardcore"" and the thirteen-minute somewhat humorous ""Olaf,Where's My $20,000?"".Most certainly not a krautrock classic,by any means.For die hards and collectors only."
1,"Olaf, give me back my $12.99","The only real link this album has to the original Amon Duul or Amon Duul II is John Weinzerel and Dave Anderson (who left after the second album to join Hawkwind for a very brief period). This material was actually recorded in the early eighties after the proper Amon Duul II disbanded (this line up is actually popularly known as Amon Duul UK). All of the material this incarnation of Amon Duul released quite awful. Possibly the worst song on the compilation would have to be ""Marcus Leid,"" in which a female vocalist (who sounds as if she is twelve) sings miserable lyrics about being ""Joan of Arc"" while the band plods on much like a tortoise munching a quaalude while encountering the gravitaional pull of Jupiter. I would not recommend this even to my worst enemies since I don't think I hate anyone quite that much (and people who do usually are in prison)."
1,Danze Tub Spout Diverter,"This product would have been a perfect match for the other peices had it not been designed differently than the past parts of 10 or more years ago. They used a new connection that fits a 1/2 inch copper pipe. Great, but most connections over 15 years ago used a threaded galvanized pipe so the part was esentially worthless."
5,Excellent Creme,"I live in the hot tropics of South Florida, and this moisterizing creme is excellent. All other products indicate that you need to avoid sun exposure because of the Alpha Hydroxy. You can use as much or as little as needed and not have to be concerned with burning. (very hard for me to avoid direct sunlight)."
3,good moisturizer product..,"This is a very good moisturizing cream. But, it is very stiff and hard to spread. I think it would be better warmed up a little (easier to spread). But, once its on, it is a very good moisturizer."
2,"giant, bulky, clumsy, cheap, though sewn fine","It's just crappy. if you want something far thicker than what serves any purpose, largely because of a thick crappy plastic reverse side that doubles if not triples its thickness, buy this. otherwise, don't cast such an economic vote: fender makes excellent products, but this isn't made in the USA (it's made in China) and it's pretty on its front side and so thick on its back that you may as well forget it. DiMarzio's clipon straps are flexible and not rigid, whereas this is entirely the opposite, sadly."
2,Retro Toothpick Dispenser,"The dispenser would not dispense toothpicks gracefully. You had to shake or tilt it. As two others reviews stated. It may have been the ""weight"" or ""knob"". I am returning it and might try ordering a new one since there are more good than bad reviews."
2,BROKEN UPON ARRIVAL,THERE IS A WEIGHT ON THIS PRODUCT THAT SERVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING SLOT POINTED UP WHICH SEATS THE TOOTHPICK AND HAS IT READY TO DISPENSE ONCE YOU ROTATE THE KNOB. ...WELL THE WEIGHT WAS BROKEN!!
1,Customers service is terrible!!,"Was sent a defective item. Customer service at Organize-It was very difficult to work with. The dispenser itself, when not defective is great. Get this toothpick dispenser through a different seller!!!!"
2,No decal-not as described,Beware if you are ordering this for the decal because there is no decal. I am waiting for the seller to ship me one and we'll see......
2,no decal on the front as pictured,If i wanted a plain toothpick dispenser I could have ordered one cheaper somewhere else. The reason for purchasing this one was for the decal.
5,When God Looked the Other Way - A great work,"This is a wonderfully written book. Told from the eyes of a child, it creates images that burst into the readers mind. This is a story of great depth. A look at war away from the battle scenes. A book that is not easy to put down."
1,UFO's do not exist! This video shouldn't either.,"Clearly, the producer did a lot of homework on this. However, the presentation is amateurish, at best. The video is almost entirely composed of scans of old photos and old documents, with a voice-over by the producer. The voice-over is filled with mispronounciations (IE: ""idears"" instead of ideas). No new information is included in the video. The video is about 120 minutes long, not the 250 listed on the package. The product description is misleading. Poorly done and not worth spending time or money on, UNLESS you need a nap."
4,Ufos over the White House?,UFOs buzzing around the White House will always get my attention. This dvd is for the open minded people out there who want to know more about the history of ufos in the modern U.S. That would be me and probably you if you are reading this.
3,Don't Let The Title Fool You - They Do Exist!,"Naturally, the title of this film was meant to show how the government wants us to believe that UFOs and aliens from other planets don't exist. They cover up anything and everything that could provide the public with absolute proof of existence of extraterrestrials. What I like about this DVD is the fact that the producer has included a lot of information from decades past and more recent. This way the viewer can get a good look at the years and years of government cover-ups. Sure, I've seen and heard a lot of this stuff before, but I still find it completely fascinating. The film maker is very passionate and knowledgeable about this topic."

5,A wonderful guide to looking great,"I used to think I had a pretty good idea of what looked good on me, but I read SAM SABOURA's book, and now I'm making sure my clothes fit me in the right way so they flatter me the most. And I'm being smarter about the pieces I buy for myself, so I'm spending less money and already feeling better about my shape. This is an excellent guide for ANY woman who wants to look their best with the time and money they already have. This is for the masses, not the models. I loved it."
5,Style Secrets -- So True!,"What a great, fun, and informative book! More than just answering my questions, this book reached in and answered questions I had no idea to ask. Lots of timeless secrets that will stick around no matter how fashions change. And I love the lively writing style -- it felt like Sam was talking to me!"
5,Fantastic!!!,"Loved this book. I'm ridiculously inspired and (much to the joy of my family and friends) can finally retire my comfy pants! Sam Saboura helps us REAL gals celebrate our curves and have fun with fashion again! Tons of tips, great illustrations and a great read all around. No doubt about it, that was money well spent."
5,Absolutely loved it,"I love the style books and even though I feel I'm pretty good at this, I learned a lot in this book and I love his tone. He makes women feel they ARE okay, whatever their body type is."
5,Lots of great tips,I like this book it has alot of great information in it and he has a very friendly style of writing. it was very encouraging.
1,Not good for a beginner,"I was looking for a basic book. You are this body shape and this is what you should wear. There were two pages of general info on each body shape, then the rest of the book was general advice. I was very disappointed."
2,Not very helpful,I was expecting way more info from this book based on Sam's makeovers for one of the morning shows. Disappointing!
3,Only the title is Hawaiian,"The Gaither's always put on a fine show, but this is just one more show from anytown. The only thing Hawaiian is the mention of the word ""Maui"". ""Mary, did you know?"" is on this program, but it's an overdone version (sappy). I guess you had to be there."
4,"Hawkwind - 'Space Ritual,Volume 2' (Thunderbolt)","One of the worthwhile titles from the UK label Thunderbolt that I was speaking of in my review of the band's 'Early Daze' disc.'Space Ritual,Volume 2' is MORE OR LESS another version of the original 2-CD 'Space Ritual'.Don't get me wrong,THIS disc is a great find.It appears to be re-edited from the first version.I took out a calculater and figured out that with the tracks you get here ""Space"",""Orgone Accumulator"",""Time We Left This World Today"" and the seven others,the listener gets a total of nine(9) minutes of music HERE that simply isn't on the first 'Space Ritual'.Still,at times I MAY prefer the 2-CD release even though I will eventually have to get off my ass to put on disc two.What a lazy world we live in,no?"
3,"Essential, but there are better versions available","Space Ritual Sundown, V.2Space Ritual Sundown, V.2 VinylThis is an essential album for Hawk fans, however the more recent masterings are much better than the '96 and '85 versions. See the above links.Warning: There is a supposed 2-Disc set that is for sale2 disc 2008 version. There are several versions of that one floating around, so just avoid any cd release in 2008 by ""Abstract Sounds"", ""Demi Monde"", or ""Plastic Head Records"". The second disc has nothing to do with The Space Ritual, and is an audience member recording (i.e. really really poor sound quality) of a so-so gig. A more complete version of that gig can be found:Text of FestivalorText of Festivalif you really want to hear it. Also the mastering on disc 1, which is The Space Ritual material is absolutely abysmal on that 2 disc set: total loudness war victim, so avoid it."
3,What's happening???,"I loved this show from day one but I just received season 3 in the mail and I'm a little disappointed.I'm only on the third disc but I'm not liking Jeffrey Coho. He doesn't add anything to the show.Why do they continue to bring old characters back? After their 15 minutes, we shouldn't see them again.Why is the gay person always the crazy, annoying killer? It was Lincoln this season and the little guy that killed his mother and the neighbor in season 1. There's only been three seasons, why is Mr Kelley already repeating the story lines?And my biggest gripe!! Why haven't I heard ""Denny Crane"" yet???Please please please, don't tell me this show is already going down hill!!"
3,less enjoyable than 1 & 2,"This season is enjoyable, however not nearly as good as season 1 & 2. I am not sure if I will buy season 4 yet because it will probably keep going downhill."
4,Still Great but needs some tweaks,"This is a great show. However, the need to give Denny Crane a better role. This character's sexual and homophobic stance is very weird and unbecoming. Just as we love to see a once great athlete rise to the occasion, Denny Crane should rise to the occasion more often.Alan and Shirley are fantastic characters but we need to see more long term development. Often times, it feels like they are trying to develop the extra characters vs. developing the main characters."
5,Denny Crain - Need I say mor?,"The adventures of Denny Crain and Alan Shore, along with a changing support cast including James Spader, Candice Bergan, Rene Auberjenois, Mark Valley, and Julie Bowen make for interesting viewing while employing the David E. Kelly skewering of modern life."
5,Will Miss Boston Legal on TV,Boston Legal is one of the most outstanding TV series ever. You can watch these episodes over and over and catch something different each time. Very well written entertainment.
3,The first two seasons are better ....,"I rated this a three relative to the other two seasons, otherwise it would be a four. Boston Legal is like most television shows, they start the series out funny or entertaining then quickly degenerate into political nonsense. Think Law and Order, except the producers are on a much faster timetable to drive the show from entertainment to political commentary. Series three is the last of this series that has any entertainment value, and even that is stretching it if you were accustomed to the liveliness of season one and two. It might be better for your memories of Boston Legal to skip watching this ...."
3,Some more classic Boston Legal,"To the best of my knowledge Boston Legal hasn't been shown on terrestrial tv in the UK yet. I was introduced to series 1 by my brother in law who sent me the box set. Since then my wife and I have been hooked. Series 3 plotlines have definitely become wierder and less believable, at least to me, although we frequently hear of strange lawsuits taking place in the States, so perhaps I need to suspend my disbelief. It has the feel of St Elswhere and LA Law which headed down the same track. I'll probably buy season 4 when it becomes available as I still want more. I doubt I'll import it as the Royal Mail slapped on an 8 ($16)handling charge just for collecting the 4 ($8) tax!"
3,Is this Legal?,"Oh so beloved show! Not as entertaining as season 2 and not as smart as season 1, but defintley worth the money.Denny Crane!!!! ( is there any need to say more? !)"
1,Brainwash BS,Could have been acceptable w/o the Liberal Agenda Hype.Give me a break. Give everybody a break!I will not watch any more of this trash.
3,I am a student at university in turkey,I am a student at university in turkey. I am studying an engineering. Iam 20 years old.
2,not usb ports,".I received my package on time. Shipping was fine. My only comment would be that the seller did not specify what the ports were so I assumed USB..... but no it was the older round port things, so if you are still planning to buy this and you got a laptop please get one of these thingsUSB to PS/2 Adapter"
3,"Good show,Bad sound","A good performance by Hawkwind....but, the sound quality is garbage.This is less than bootleg quality.Wish I knew this before purchasing the disc."
5,Still the best out there......,"I had to buy new tins of shoe polish this week to get my shoes up and running for the Autumn/Winter months. This polish is still the best out there and does a great job on my leather shoes...I polished my shoes last night and had someone actually tell me today that my shoes looked brand new even though they are two years old.I don't ever want to live without this polish !! It lasts forever, it does a fabulous job and you can't beat the price...I'm glad I stocked up, it sure won't go to waste !!!"
1,Don't Buy Kiwi Products,"I have reason to believe Kiwi Shoe Polish ruined my shoes. I noticed that after polishing a new pair of shoes that there were dark streaks on my shoes. Since the shoes were new and had never been worn I suspected there was something wrong with the polish. I took a paper towel and ran it around the top of the polish. To my surprise, in addition to the color of the polish the paper towel turned cherry red in spots. Since the polish was brown there was no reason for there to be any hint of red in the polish. I'm convinced that the red substance in the polish is what ruined my shoes. I'll never touch another Kiwi product again and I'd suggest that you shop for another brand of polish from a company that actually cares about quality control."
5,"Ars Nova ""Sunshine & Shadows"" reissue still fresh and most welcome!","Great to have this little gem available on CD! ""Sunshine & Shadows"" is one of the most unique sounding late 60's efforts put to wax. An early example of ""Jazz-Rock"" fusion of sorts, this release boasts the talents of Wyatt Day who sings and writes pretty satisfying lyrics, Sam Brown, who provides lead guitar, Jimmy Owens, who plays some very tasty trumpet, and Warren Bernhardt, who adds a nice keyboard timbre. All in all this album has a great deal of variety ranging from ""Old-Timey"" sounding tunes like ""Rubbish"" to delicate statements like ""She Promises Everything"" to powerful rock items like the title track and ""Please Don't Go Now."" Do yourself a favor and pick this recording up, put it in an auto cd player - turn up the volume and cruise down the highway! The alternative is to invite friends over for a get-together and turn them on to this neglected fusion masterpiece! A must have!"
2,mediocre 2nd lp,"This second album from 1969 is inferior to the debut of the year before. Only Jon Pierson and Wyatt Day were still around from the first album. While there is a variety of styles explored on the album, from jazz to folk rock, ballads to pop, the songs aren't as consistently intriguing. It isn't an awful album, the title track is pretty good for instance. However, like the first it was commercially unsuccessful, and it's easy to see why as this is a bland release for the most part."
5,Very readable and excellent,"Peter has written several books. Because of the broad and profound scope of his agenda it is difficult to communicate it in writing. Thanks to the editing of his wife, this is the first readable book that covers his excellent material. Start here - do not get any of his other books first.He covers basic principles such as relaxation, centering, and rooting that are necessary for any martial art or complex physical/relational activity. His emphasis on mental/awareness training is an important contribution to the field."
5,EXCELLENT HIDDEN GEM,this is one of those hidden gems among the music industry. gave it a try and very impressed with the this artist.
1,dissatisfied,never recieved item seller said it was listed wrong but could sell me same item at a higher priceCAN NOT RECCOMEND THIS SELLER
1,Another voice in the chorus of BOOs,"I felt I needed to contribute this review to drive the average rating further down. No offense to the person who gave this two stars, but this disc doesn't deserve ONE. The info on its dubious origins was new to me but not surprising. This one has almost an identical song list to one I have on vinyl but didn't see listed here (might've missed it among the other 121 entries), called ""Live 70-74."" That one is not the greatest recording either, but it's an audiophile's dream compared to this terrible offering. It would be worth it to get a copy of the hilarious ""In The Egg,"" but find it on another release and don't bother with this one. In addition to the overall poor quality, the recording levels are almost nonexistent. Unless you crank it up to maximum volume you won't even believe there is ANY sound on this disc at all."
2,Bring me the Head of the Guy That Released This Turkey,"It's pretty hard to believe that this is an Official record company release - perhaps Hawkwind's first for a Live show - but apparently it is. Only notable for spoken intro to ""Urban Guerilla""."
1,Not worthy of one star,"All else aside, I've heard better sound quality from tape recorders placed under a chair than you can find on this one.To bad it is a waste of some decent cover art and a name for an album."
4,dave mason definitive collection,"This is a good but not great collection. Dave's music and voice have gotten better and stronger over the years and he is in his prime form now. The quality of these recordings is very good. Dave can sing most of his early songs much better now, with a stronger and clearer voice. A good collection to start with for those who are just discovering Dave Mason."
5,a harmony of mixture,"Although nothing compares to Mike Barnet live, this cd gets close. It is a perfect blend of heartwrenching tunes (Art of Drowing and Bottle Rocket), political angst (Soldier's Hymn), pure comedy (Ode to Saint Peter, I Love You and Dope Song), upbeat groove (In my Time of Dying and Beautiful Woman), soulful melodies (Side Walk Ghost) and a little bit of love (Everyman). Mike has a way of writing what touches the soul. His story telling in unmatched, tied together with his dynamic voice and innovative style of music. This cd will have you singing along at the top of your lungs in no time. It is highly recommended. (I have already bought 5 copies for myself and my friends)"
1,Urgh!,"This thing barely picks up the pills on your clothes and to top it off when it did pick one up...it tore a hole in my sweater!! Urgh! Buy a different brand, this one sucks."
3,FUZZ AWAY,"I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS SAME ITEM I ORDERED, ANOTHER TYPE WAS SENT TO ME.THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS O.K. BUT PREFERRED TO HAVE GOT THE ONE I ORDERED."
1,worse product EVER,"this thing is lame...it does not work at all. it does not pick up any lint, pills, etc. do not waste your time and money."
1,Bad Review Book!,"I just bought this book to review the math section, as its my weak spot on the SATs. The book is good in terms of giving you lots of practice problems, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to teach me the math! It is a good companion for a textbook, or something of the sort, but it will not be sufficient to be used solely as a math review book.I bought the book expecting to be taught math. Its explanations are very brief and convoluting, and overall, its a poorly written and designed book. Skip over it, and look elsewhere."
5,High School Teachers A Must,"For those of you just starting out teaching the new math for your SAT Prep class, this book is great. It is outlined in accordance with the college boards Standards for Student Success. A must buy for your shelf, or as a class set."
5,"So good, even a goldfish can improve their SAT score!","I took several practice tests, and was doing pretty poorly -- about 430, which is pretty good for a fish, but pretty pathetic overall.I went through this book, carefully did all the excercizes and learned all the test-taking techniques, and my score shot up to 520! Still not great, but better than most of the Liberal Arts majors at the state college.I owe it all to Kaplan!"
3,More Like Wild Huckleberry Jelly,"According to my mom, for whom it was bought as a gift, she and her boyfriend couldn't detect any actual berries in this pie filling, though the taste was fine. They DID like the huckleberry candies, though."
3,Disappointing DVD,"I agree with ""guitarguy"" about the poor production of the DVD. Archival footage from ""Beat Club"" at Radio Bremen was officially released for other bands (Yes, Deep Purple, ...) and the quality is great for these other releases. But here, for the Soft Machine footage, it seems that Cuneiform used wrong tools to convert the original PAL format onto NTSC: the resulting video is choppy and to me it's the result of a very very poor PAL to NTSC conversion process. Why they failed for such a basic video work, is a mystery. Even with basic tools on PC, I can perform better conversions. To me they should re-issue it either in its original PAL format, or to use professional tools and technicians for the video conversion."
3,"Good, but not my favorite","While I love this band, I have to say this is my least favorite CD of theirs. Instead of the sort of macabre humor displayed in their other albums, they go a little too far and it becomes more an album about going about and killing. I love it when they are funny about it, but if it is just a song about stabbing someone with a shank, no thanks.That being said the last track is in fact up to their usual standards, being ""Dad, why did my friends explode."" Very funny dark humor."
5,Cosmos,"It is an extraordinary way to learn about the Cosmos, our world and human kind.Highly recommendable for everyone with a little curiosity."
4,Cosmos Video Collection,Videos are in very good condition. This was a great deal; very nice product at a LOW price!
3,not as good as the original,"Disappointed that Hubble shots and such replaced some of the original artistic special effects. Also, why so many disks?"
1,"Great show, lousy production quality on DVD remake","I have loved this show since it was first aired and have waited patiently for its eventual release on DVD (or VHS for that matter). Although I haven't seen the show in fifteen years or more, it was still as great as I remembered as I viewed the DVD version. The problem is the master tapes they must have used are a little worn out, with the DVD looking in places like an overplayed VHS tape. Chapter 7 would not play at all! Buyer beware."
4,Inaccurate Japanese Subtitles(episode 1 only),"I understand COSMOS is the fine documentary series ever.DVD Box Set claims ""Fully international Edition"".But in episode 1, Japanese subtitles are not correct.Order of Japanese subtitles in episode 1 seems to confuse inmatching dialogues.Corrections are needed."
3,What happened to the musical background?,"I won't try to review these programs. Everyone knows this is one of the best series ever. But I do believe they have changed the musical background. One of the main reasons I purchased this set was for the beautiful music, along with the great images and information. However, it seems that the people who made the music change have proven they have truly reached the level of ""Peter's Principal"" and we are stuck with music that is much less desirable. Carl's original score really set off this program. Shame on the people who made that change. Shame! Shame! Shame!"
1,Cosmos- A dud,"If you're looking for actual live footage of space and galaxie shots you won't find it here. This box set appears to have been produced in the late 70's possibly early 80's, and gives fair documentry but is very poor in visual stimulation.I give this selection a one star for poor visual but fair documentation Is it worth what's priced you may ask ? In my opinion, no! not even half."
5,Just a nostalgic look back,"Remember when this show first appeared, had read the books by Mr. Sagan and loved them. When I read them I thought that they sould have made a tv show about them and my wish has been fulfilled. Granted, most of the science has gone way past that available in that day. I don't care. Must just look at Carl Sagan as maybe not the greatest scientist ever, but an innovator of putting science in a way that it is actually interesting. When that show came out I watched it every time it came on. Got it for posterity."
5,Best TV series yet about the universe?,"Many TV shows and series have been created about the cosmos since ""Cosmos"" first aired--many excellent--but I rather believe that ""Cosmos"" remains the best for people with little to no understanding of cosmology. Carl Sagan was so passionate about his life's work that his words were infectious, and still are for first time viewers. You needn't have a phD to understand the concepts he attempts to impart to viewers of ""Cosmos,"" and I believe that most people find it both informative and entertaining."
5,"Carl Sagan, still the best","I highly recommend both the DVD set and the book. In this country, we need a resurgence in interest and passion for science. The material in this rich presentation is still relevant, particularly with the updates. If I had had access to a program like this as a child, I'm sure that I would have become a scientist. Sagan's sense of wonder and awe at the beauty and infinite mystery of the universe is totally infectious."
5,"As good as ever, even better!","This is a ""must buy"" for science and philosophy enthusiasts. The added ""10 years after"" commentary by Carl is an interesting and thoughtful inclusion. The amazing thing about this is that it is still very current with regard to scientific view of the universe with very little exception. It was a real shame to lose Carl at a relative young age, he was a major contributor to main-stream thought and view on the way things are and why."
5,Cosmos,"Cosmos: Carl Sagan (7 DVD Set)This is a beautiful DVD set. It is informative and educational for all ages. While time has shown that his predictions were accurate; he still added updates at the end of some of the episodes. I recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about science, astrology or the environment."
5,Extraordinary,"This is the most beloved set of DVDs I own. Dr. Sagan is exquisite in his detail and description of the universe. His explanations are powerful and gripping, yet easy to understand. We watch each episode over and over again. They are that good."
5,Indispensable,"Cosmos is the best popular science documentary/series I have ever watched. Carl Sagan has an unmatched ability to describe the beauty of the universe and of science in general. Cosmos is relevant and interesting despite being 27 years old. The image quality of this documentary is not great, since old cinematic technology was used; even so, it is still great to watch."
5,A son's gift,This item was a Christmas gift for my son who said he had wanted this for a very long time. I am sure he is enjoying every minute of it.
5,5 out of 5 is still not enough,"This is the most amazing DVD set ever. Buy a set for yourself and everyone you know. If everyone saw this, the world would be much better off. Not just from the skeptic's standpoint, but also the scientist's. Utterly prophetic regarding climate change. And this was in the late 70's and early 80's. If you go to church, buy this DVD, stay home on Sundays, and watch it with the entire family."
4,Looked bit old but quality was good,"I am more a man with content over quality in this case... Made available by Amazon, looked bit old but quality was good. This is rare collection, enjoyed by all 3 genres at home..."
5,Very enlightening,"Watching this series was the most memorable and best thing I ever did while in public school, and I didn't do it until my senior year. It's nearly 30 years old now, but is more relevant now than it was back then, and that fact is with me every day. Carl Sagan was a great man, and I hope he has found peace somewhere out there."
5,Really motivating to go for science,"I saw this series on TV some 20 years ago and it motivated me to go for science. It is understandable for everyone, but it is not going for over simplicity and it is always quite accurate. Even now after over 20 years the core of it remains valid. It is very motivating and it covers many important facts of the history of science on earth. If you are interested in science, mathematics, physics, astronomy etc this is a must buy."
2,Lost its poof,"I am so disappointed with this chair...for the first few days it was awesome and then it just lost its poof altogether and it's totally limp, I tried to find somewhere I could ask the manufacturer or seller why this happened and what we could do...but i found nothing. I'm glad it happened before we bought a second one, which we almost did, but I still wish i could find a solution to this...it wasn't cheap!"
5,Super practical,"I love this book. I didn't realize how much until I found myself checking it out and renewing it endless times at the library. It's too bad it's out of print. This book gives you everything you need to get started right away. You really don't need any other book to get control of your finances. After spending a little bit of time logging my expenses (the forms are included), I was able to get a clear picture of what I was spending and making. I needed only the forms included in the book, a copier and a few other simple materials (listed in the book) to get my self in shape. It helped me get rid of that sinking feeling I would get when thinking about money."
4,Still the best,"I've lived in France and studied college level French classes.My take on these tapes...Yes, these lessons do not have a pronunciation guide. This is an important drawback and is the reason I only give it 4 stars. And true, the book does not have an index. So what...this is minor drawback.If you believe that the only way to speak a foreign language *fluently* is by speaking it, these tapes are an absolute must.The rote drills are sometimes tiresome, but they work. I learned to speak French in France because I repeated the same sentences over and over. Rote is boring, but is still the best way.Don't be fooled, there is no easy, painless way to learn a foreign language. It takes hard work and effort."
5,Way more hygienic than dry paper.,"After using these flushable wipes for a few months, I realize that the custom of using dry paper is pretty disgusting! These leave me feeling considerably cleaner.I've heard many complaints that these can easily clog sewage systems (and I'm certain these are not safe with septic systems), but I flush only 1 or 2 wipes at a time and have not had any problems."
4,good but expensive,You can totally order these through other stores for way cheaper even with s&h. Way over priced here. Compare prices before you buy. Shop smart!!
2,ok but....,"they are too small!!!! And they do not dispense one at a time, you can grab for one and end up with a handful it take TWO hands to use these not convient if your changing a baby. They are hypo allerginc and easy on the skin though."
3,DOES Contain Alcohol,"Under the Product Information tab is says that this product is ""Alcohol Free"" ... but Witch Hazel lists alcohol as its first ingredient.If you need alcohol free read everything carefully."
5,Works!,"These are very big rectangles (approximately four-inches by seven-inches), so I tear them in half to make them more square-like; that helps save on waste. The box is sturdy plastic. The wipes are moist, and they smell good. I have never had a problem with them flushing. I am on sewer not septic, so I can not testify to that."
2,Heavily perfumed; Rougher than other brands,"I bought these because of the positive reviews and the fact that these wipes contain witch hazel, which is a healing agent. I won't be buying these again, however, because they reek of perfume. I don't know that the smell lingers on me, but it's certainly noticeable in the bathroom and in the trash.Smell aside, I also find this brand to be rougher than others (like Kandoo). The Wet Ones remind me of moistened dryer sheets."
2,"On the whole, a little rough.","Probably not bad if you're a once-a-day patron.Any kind of extensive clean up and you're in for a rough ride.Can still clog a toilet with these (even with courtesy flushes). They seem to be a little too thick for ""flushable.""Will search for better wipes to get behind."
3,"Nice wipe, BUT....","As most reviewers have stated, these are great wipes, BUT the big problem is the packaging, the container is not one that provides a ""pop-up"" easy to grab wipe, these wipes are wet and as such tend to stick together, so you have to dig them out of the container, with sometimes four or five stuck together, and good luck getting these out if you do not have fingernails. This company makes several types of Wet Wipes that all come in a pop-up container, why not these????? I'm going back to Wally-World's baby wipes."
3,"Okay sound, but no match for samsung uproar phone","I bought this to replace my Samsung Uproar phone when I dropped Sprint PCS. I was initially disappionted because the uproar is so good in comparison, but I've quickly gotten over that. I like it and would buy it again. Here are some things to keep in mind.Pros:Decent sound qualityuses removable memory so you can put in a bigger cardeasy file transfer[inexpensive]P>Cons:No equalizer controlsUses bulky parallel port memory card readerUses Multimedia memory cards (they're still a little pricy compared to smart memory or CF cards)uses non-standard earphones (can't use your walkman phones)memory card can slip out of place and stop playingeasy to accidentally disconnect the player from the phone when moving around."
4,Guidebook,"The only reason I don't love it is because it was a used product with slight wear, it came early through the mail,and was just what I expected."
2,Rushed and boring :(,The whole book is okay but it seems rushed and not personally talking to you like some other guides and has no story explanations or add-ons anywhere. Giving spoilers is a bad but helpful thing and helps you learn what your character's personalities are like. Not even any character bios or explaning what the H**l force points are or what the heck is the point of the game. In this case the game is great and gives you a post-modern wild west feel...
2,Sloppy,"Typos, poor explanations, no details. It helps, and you'll need it for this game - but it seems very rushed."
3,mediocre,"if you really love heavy vegetable then i guess you might like this collection of unreleased tracks, b sides, acoustic versions of classic HV songs, etc.there are a few good songs (st livingston is one of the catchiest HV songs ive heard) but overall Mondo Aqua Kitty pales in comparison to their studio albums"
3,Beneath the fan-intensive scraps remains interesting ideas,"The fractured, largely acoustic, pop zaniness was an obvious benchmark for songwriter Rob Crow's assured evolution with the band Pinback. With his earlier outfit, Crow could cultivate his fun, though smart brand of rhythmically relentless ditties. Mondo Aqua Kitty will not shine compared to more focused studio material, but for a collection of b-sides, alternative takes and what-not, the album presents a compelling exploration into the composers determined approach of attacking traditional form. Unfortunately, the 20+ tracks tend to meld into a sound too fast, quirky, and underdeveloped to prove enveloping, but the minority of varied material does sometimes pull out impressively written, fully developed songs. Best left for fans, but interesting enough to appeal just enough to the warped folkie in us all."
3,Good as an overview,"This book touches on a lot of different TV soap operas, without going in-depth on many of them. It's a compilation of miscellanous facts and figures. It's more for the hard-core soaps fan who watches several shows and can appreciate a variety of information."
2,Beautiful but uncomfortable,Set of 2 Modern Contemporary Tan Microfiber Parson Dining ChairsBoth chairs have a bump that you can feel with your back.
4,ONE OF THE BEST GOSPEL CHOIRS OUT THERE!,"Go ahead Lamar Campbell and Spirit Of Praise! I enjoy this album more, each time I listen to it. Hopefully, you'll get the exposure you deserve for this CD. Wake-up Christians! There's more to gospel music than Kirk Franklin and Fred Hammond! Don't let your local stations box you in to just a few artists, when so many others are so deserving of notice. This CD is worthy of your support."
2,not your uncles chucks,nike bought converse. they raised the price and lowered the quality. ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened. these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast. they are no longer a long lasting shoe. but they still look cool.
5,converse are great,"these shoes are some of the best shoes that i have ever had. At first i thought that they would not last long if i played sports or ran around in them long,but now that it has been a couple of months and they still are intact, after at least45 P.E.s.these are also some of the most comfortible shoes that i have ever had.at first they are not very comfortible to run around in or exerice in, but after a while they break in,and they are as good,if not better, than those $80 nikes."
5,cool shoes,"If you want people to like you for what you wear and not who you are, buy these shoes. People will think you're cool when you're not. Worked for me."
4,Hardness of the World/The Concept - Slave,"This is truly one of the funkiest cd's that Slave has ever released!I can hardly wait for ""Snapshot""...."
5,The eye of the beholder.,"This book will be different things to different people.I can't speak to the accuracy of the text as one critic has but I will say that I learned a few interesting things.As a hobbiest illustrator and amature artist, I do appreciate the excellent work of the young trout enthusiast and author. I would not consider the comments of our friend the ""scientific illustrator"" who claims, ""On my first attempts at color, i could easily do that kind of work."" Well said. I eagerly await your comments on Picasso's ""bicycle parts"".This book is not a masterpiece but a work of art. I don't believe it to profess to be the definitive word on trout, yet it offers some interesting tidbits.Most of all this book resides in the place that borders two wonderful worlds; that of trout and that of art. For those who are intrigued by either world, this book will make a very welcomed addition to your library. For those of us captivated by both worlds, this book is an absolute must."
3,Trout: An Illustrated History....Torn Jacket,"I received Trout: An Illustrated History from Amazon 12/07, I have never had any bad experiences with Amazon ever...But this is the holiday's and this book Trout: An Illustrated History was a gift for my husband, I received it with a ""ripped up"" Jacket!!! not expected from Amazon.com so I'm disappointed. Quality control!!! what happened Amazon?The book itself is very beautiful written with exceptional water color art, and we have another book from same author and I highly recommend it, if you have a trout lover in the family this book will surely please them."
2,It's art but is it good?,"Being a scientific illustrator of fish, I dare say a few words about this book. These fish are pleasant to look at but the art work is no masterpiece. On my first attempts at color, i could easily do that kind of work."
3,Good for travelling but not good for every day translation.,"This book is good if you're looking for a travel translator but not good if you're looking for an every day dictionary/translator.I bought it to help with everyday conversation tips and only found it useful for mealtime conversation- otherwise, it's not great. But, it would be the perfect translator for a trip to Turkey as a tourist. Great little phrases, great descriptions and very clearly laid out."
2,Poorly written study guide,"I found this book to be a poorly written study guide. The format used and the order that information is presented in is confusing and awkward. I am an MCSE, MCP+I, and a CNA. I have used Sybex and Exam Cram books for all other tests and plan to use them for this one as well."
1,"Seller ""just forgot"" to ship product. She doesn't do this for a living.","I never got the product. I emailed the seller two times with no response whatsoever. Finally, on the third time I got a response a week later stating that she doesn't make a living selling books, rather she is a student who just sells her used books. She was sorry, she just forgot to ship the book."
2,Those Who Can Teach REVIEW,The product came super fast but did have some damages-over all it was great THANKS!
5,Excellent for personal and financial literacy,"This product is of interest to me because I teach personal finance and investment classes to mostly young Generation Y African Americans, but also Boomers. I also have presented workshops/seminars on personal finance to faith groups and others. This video has something for most audiences interested in this topic and shows what is being done to address personal financial literacy in one community by a passionate faith/church leader. I find it is very helpful in reinforcing discussions around debt, college and career planning, and the current financial recession's impact on African American families."
2,Almighty Debt a Black American Experience,"The delivery of my dvd was on time, however I was disappointed in the content. It was different from the tv version. This was not the full version I saw on TV. They left out many segments of the documentary that I thought were quite relevant. I missed the indept discussion with the Pastor on tithing and his church's finance. Also it did not show the town hall meeting with Bishop Jakes and Reverend Deforest Soaries. I would like to know if there is a second part or missing DVD because this was clearly not the full version."
1,Really?!?,"I for one am sick to death of this racial crap. EVERYBODY is having a hard time right now regardless of color, and to single out a color is idiotic.For all of us out here who are middle class, and perhaps a bit lower who have purchased a home, and then lost their jobs, color has little relevance. I WISH that I could blame everything that was bad in my life as being a direct result of my skin color. It would be much easier if I could blame others for the crappy stuff that I have to deal with financially instead of my personal spending choices. No, this book is a sham, and the authors should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Waltz with Bashir,This film (Waltz With Bashir)transcends the war film genre and although animated has greater impact and sense of reality then live action films like Saving Private Ryan.Anyone watching Waltz with Bashir will be haunted by the film just as film maker was by the massacre.Now I would love to see a big budget film of Sabra/Shatilla from a Palestinian viewpoint but till then this film is the definitive film about Sabra/Shatilla and is a must see.
5,A must see for those interested in Middle Eastern or International Studies,"I applaud the director of this film and cannot put into words the emotions felt from watching this candid documentary. I recommend this for all interested in Middle Eastern studies or International Relations! Seriously, I wish more people would see this film so that people would know the true horror of war and how we must do everything that we can to stop it from happening."
5,Engaging from start to finish,"This movie may be too serious for the mass audience, but I found it utterly riveting for the story, told from the point of view of a man trying to remember where he was in the 1982 war in Lebanon. I've never seen animation that has so blown me away with its poetic beauty (phrase sounds hackneyed, but I mean it) and the accompanying soundtrack is rip-roaring good. I didn't like the events that happened in this movie -- after all, it's about one man's experience of a war, revealed bit by bit as he visits and talks with others who may be able to help him reassemble the story piece by piece -- but the telling was lyrical and compelling.This is the sort of movie that's probably best seen in a big-screen cinema house, but probably won't last that long or go outside of the arthouse circuit. Failing that, watch it on the biggest screen you can find."
2,disappointing,I was so looking forward to watching the movie but I could not. It was supposed to be subtitled but it WAS NOT!!!!! Disappointing!!!
2,Waltz with Bashir?,I was disappointed by this film. I had hoped for more insight regarding the Israel-Lebanon War. I thought this merely an exercise in soul cleansing. Not that that is bad. I just don't see how this film could be so highly rated. I guess the PC factor played into since it was sort of anti-Israeli. I learned nothing that was already common knowledge.
1,"Vile, Terrorist Propaganda","I gave it a one because -9 was not an option.If you want Vile, Terrorist Propaganda you're in luck.If you like truth, avoid at all costs, you will have wasted your money and placed a coating of mud on your mind.In the ""special features"" the director of this mess states it's slow because the budget was low. The movie portrays the Israeli Forces as bloodthirsty confused dope-smoking cowards, and the terrorists as the brave poor victims and victorious underdogs."
4,Nice addition,Could be a slightly better fit.What I did was take the tape off that was supplied and added a skinner tape so the billet could fit into the slot better.I also took my time in forming the billet (bending) to meet the fenders curve.That seemed to help.
4,good practices on the DAT,I read this book and I really liked it. The author did a good job with lots of sample questions and techniques. I recommend this book along with the topscore pro DAT on the computer.
5,"Hip Hop @ it's Best, God",This book is one of the best things that happened to me. This sh*t is tight as all hell. It made me start thinking of things like chess and philosophy and relating them to everyday life. Cop this book EARLY!
4,do you like the wu,"if you like the wu this is for you. if you like hiphop its a good read. so many little fill ins for missing wu knowledge. the best bits will depend on where you come at hiphop from, as an mc i liked the annotated lyrics section. it is fairly comprehensive overview of the wu and well worth the price. buy it or stay a sucker mc forever."
4,Wu-tang Manual - Essentials,Deadly manual of Wu-tang Clan !Contains explanations over members and codes.Very usefull to get the true meanings of lyrics.U Must have it!
5,Must Have,"The Wu are probably the greatest hip hop group ever. The RZA is an absolutely genius. The best thing about this manual is that it finally proves to naysayers the depth and achievements of Wu-Tang as innovators and true street poets, who broke down so many barriers in hip hop and music generally. Alot of the Wu philosophy is revealed and RZA's descriptions are connoted with autobiographical and historical references that are really interesting, to any true Wu fan. I still listen to Wu avidly and people laugh at me because everyone else was through with them in high-school. But just get the latest MASTA KILLAH joint - the Wu are still amazing."
5,Not for newcomers,"The Wu-Tang Clan has been of the primary influences in my life, starting my interest in Hip-Hop music and culture as a youth through adulthood. This book is amazing; however, a novice listener of the Wu will not truly understand this book. A bandwagon listener of the Wu will not truly understand this book. This book is for the true heads, the people that have been intrigued with the sound, slang, style and charisma of the Wu-Tang ever since they first dropped on the music scene. If you're one of these fans, buy this book; you won't be dissapointed. For all you corny,wannabe, Johnny-come-latelys that claim to be a Wu fan and only own The W and Iron Flag, do us all a favor and don't buy this book; it will be a piece of genius that will go to waste collecting dust.Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game!"
5,The RZA makes another classic!,"This book is great for all Wu fans! Rza gives an in-depth look into the history of the Wu Tang Clan, its members, its songs and even the philosophies of the clan. This is a must read for anyone interested in the true innovators of the hip-hop game. From being the first rap group to have a clothing line, to the first rappers with a video game - the WU really taught all other rap labels how to stunt and laid a blueprint down for being successful in areas other than just rapping. Get this book to gain insight on the most prolific rap super group ever!"
2,Descent of Family Guy,"This is basically half of a TV season for a full season price. And it isn't funny. Maybe the number of episodes is a good thing, less time wasted with this junk. Watch seasons 1-3 for quality TV."
2,Royally Rogered,"Family Guy is a great show.TOO BAD THERE ISN'T VERY MUCH OF IT HERE!Of the 3 disks, only 2 have episodes. The 3rd contains ""extras"" of dubious worth, including what is basically an ad for Family Guy toys.DAMN YOU, & SUCH! When World Domination is mine, you shall rue this shabby treatment!"
3,WHERE IS THE REST????,"I am an ardent, hard core Family Guy fan, but where is the rest of the season?? When is it coming out at least? We definitley got screwed here, but I don't think its the creators fault-I think Fox is the culprit. All I want is the rest of the season!"
2,Speak with your money,"i LOVE Family Guy, it really is a laugh out loud comedy. My only problem with them is this, 1/2 a season per DVD set? Sure, other shows release singles like that, but not for +30$. Until they stop trying to screw us with half a product, i'll have to halt my purchases of these sets... afterall, still have P2P."
1,13 Episodes for HOW much???,I WILL not buy any more Family Guy merchandise until these seasons start getting released as FULL seasons. This is crap that we are being treated this way. $40 retail cost for 13 22 minute episodes? My boycott begins...Chad Koenig
3,"Fun, but Cant Live Up to its Past","This is a fun DVD and a can not miss for any fan of Family Guy. Unfortunately, the problems with Family Guy become more frequent in this season and the show loses some quality. It is thoroughly enjoyable and great to bring out at parties, but it pales in comparison to the first three box sets.If you are new to Family Guy, start with Seasons 1, 2, and 3."
1,Viewers' Revenge,"i agree with the other reviews written by loyal fans who don't appreciate this extortionate practice of piecemeal DVD season releases: this half-season nonsense has got to end.luckily, viewers now have another option: DVR/tivo, then burn those episodes to DVD. i did this, but was going to buy the official set for the better quality, as well as the extras, etc. but i can't think of a good reason to spend $50+ (discounted) on season 5 parts 1&2."
1,"Quality There and Important Yes, But Qantity is a part of the overall Product","I hope FOX learns a lesson here and sales drop, this is the only show where you see them spliting seasons to make an extra $...i own all the others, but i dont know, i dont like being gouged.......The show was Hilarity again, not to deny that but The Quality and Quantity of the Package is a part of rating the product. HMMMM is that the Simpsons Season 10 over there with 23 episodes for the same price?????"
3,This series is running out of steam,"I love this show! Especially the early seasons and the ""Stewie Griffen: The Untold Story"" movie. After it returned from being cancelled, however, it gradually got less and less funny. This season still made me laugh quite a bit but none of the episodes kept me laughing long enough to make my face hurt, which to me is what a really great comedy should do. Everything considered, if you are a fan of this series as I am, you will want to own this half season DVD for your collection, but if you don't already own the other seasons I would recommend getting the ""Family Guy Freakin' Party Pack"" which includes the complete series, the movie, a bonus disc with special features and a crapload of cool family guy stuff(playing cards, etc.)"
1,"wrong item, over and over","The item is advertised as a box set, but is actually a clamshell case with three discs stuffed inside of it. The box set exists, as the photos attest, but Amazon doesn't carry it and instead stocks the clamshell versio."
3,Disappointed,"I brought the Family Guy, Vol. 5 (Season 5 Part 1) by Seth MacFarlane for my son for Christmas. He loves the Family Guy. The only problem I had with purchasing this DVD is that I thought I was buying a new one. When I got it and looked at it there was no wrapping on it. I could of paid $5 more for a new one. The C.D. is in good condition and my son is happy, but next time I will really pay attention to what I am paying for."
5,You MUST get this!,"I can't believe I spent the better part of my life not knowing about the Griffin family. I have every season, and never tire of laughing my .... let's just say I get really tickled.If you don't have this, you MUST get it. Now. Right now."
4,STOP complaining!,"I wish people would just enjoy the show for what it is instead of bashing it on here. If (in my opinion) you want to comment on it say something positive not negative. THere's enough negative crap in the world as it is. Sure every show and movie out there has flaws. Nobody is perfect. You know there is a button on your t.v. remote that says on/off you know. Stewie is my fave character! I got the family guy bendable set and a Stewie plush animated doll. HILARIOUS!!! SOmeone always comments on it when new people come over. You know they should make a movie: ""Chucky vs. Stewie""! That would've been better I believe than the ""Seed of CHucky"". THink about it, there both bout the same size and both have overalls. Hmmmm. What you all think? Just a idea. I got a few Chucky dolls from 12"" to 30"" too. That Stewie Halloween costume is cool too!"
1,Family Guy Blows.........,"Family Guy sucks. Not funny now, never been funny. If you buy this crap you are wasting your money. Spend your money on a real animated comdey series like The Simpsons or South Park, even Futurama!! Anything but Family Guy."
3,Why only so few episodes?,"I have been waiting for this DVD to come out since the day after Volume four was released, to be honest :-)Therefore, I was all the more disappointed to find out that there were only going to be less than 15 episodes on a set that fans have anticipated for almost a year!I haven't seen all the the individual episodes yet (although the ones I did see were hilarious, as usual) and couldn't wait to finally watch them and now they do this half-season nonsense.This is a huge and expensive blow for us fans, consdidering that volume one still had a whole 28 episodes on it and cost just about the same.Dare I say I will be purchasing Season 10 of ""The Simpsons"" instead?"
3,Weakness,It's funny that a great show like Robot Chicken gives you 200 minutes of funny for just 20.00 dollars. Something does not add up with this family guy.... just like the last couple of volumes out there. Don't get me wrong though I will spend the money for it.
1,dont buy: waste of money,do buy this because this volume is 146 minutes and cost 25.99 and volume 1 is 624 minutes and cost only 34.99so they are trying to rip you off and don't let them get your money if you really want to buy it buy the party edition thing because you get volumes 1-5 and Stewie griffins untold story and ping pong stuff and poker stuff
2,Worth watching as packaged?,"I hate to admit it, but the humor of Family Guy is starting to wear a little thin and *GASP* become predictable. That said, this set contains some great episodes. I would buy it were it not for the greedy way Fox is manipulating the public--oh, buy half a season! Both half-seasons add up to more $$ than a full season would. This stinks!"
3,Price should be lowered,"I love family guy, but this set was terrible. Out of 3 DVD's only 2 had episodes. The third disc only contains ""special features,"" which is a joke. I seriously believe I got ripped off! This set should be sold at a lower price since it only contained 13 episodes."
3,Stewey is the Bomb,a volume that makes fun of the typical family. very adult humor and very distastfully funny.
1,Where's the funny?,"This will be the last Family Guy DVD I will ever buy. I will most likely be selling this one off to a used DVD store to be honest.It's a full price half season. You only get two DVDs with episodes, and one garbage DVD with ""extras"" that aren't worth a crap.My main question would be this: Where is the funny?Seriously, who the hell is this funny to other than the writers? I laughed exactly 6 times for the entire DVD set. It was AWFUL. This is supposed to be a comedy cartoon right?The first DVD set of Family Guy was pretty descent, it had more story and more intelligent gags. Now it's just random crap.South Park had it right with Cartoon Wars. Family Guy is crap."
1,Rip Off,"I don't know why Fox started splitting up the family guy seasons. There is obviously no reason to do this other than to get more money from the consumers. THe American Dad DVD series (fromt he creators of family guy) started doing that with there first DVD set. However, they corrected that problem in the second DVD set and gave us the remainder of the first season with the second. Anyway, Family Guy is great, but don't get roped in to buying these DVDs. I will not buy this one unless Fox repackages this one, or corrects its mistake with the next release."
1,I am disappointed,"As a consumer, I would like to think I was getting the ""Whole Series"" as they aired. I was most disappointed when I got this. Whoever is responsible for not including the rest of the series, please, do it."
4,Better than the last season,"After the stale, song-laden season 4, this set practically comes off fresh. Gone are (most of) the full-song productions and back are strong ideas and better managed segues. Oh, and offensive like its fans like."
5,Hillarious Volume,"Really great Volume !!! I loved every series of Family Guy and i certainly adored this Volume, a real must see for anyone who loves watching Family Guy."
2,Milk my money!,Love family guy but I'm sick of them milking our money from us! True fans will buy volume after volume. It's like they are worried that their cash cow will run out of talent.. so milk the fans now! Gr!
1,Bummer...Just Rent it....,"You'd be better off renting this set. Disk 3 is only bonus features, no episodes at all. I'd say if you can get it between 15-20 dollars then your ok. Retail price too high for crappy product."
3,Great and FUNNY ...But ..,"This collection is so funny but not many episodes , cheaper in price I thought more episodes would be on these DVDs ."
3,"It's still Family Guy, but still....","I have to agree with alot of the people reviewing this package. I mean Family Guy is Family Guy and the show is fantastic. (hence the 3 stars) But splitting up a season into two sepreate volumes, I mean its one of the most viewed shows on network television surley you don't need the money! I mean I don't think anyone will watch the special features! The show is pretty much all you need! I can already draw Peter Griffen too thank you very much. Just leaving the season finale out of this volume and have me and all the other fans wait for a 6th volume is just cruel. I can bet that the Star Wars spoof season premiere will be sold as a sinlge dvd and named volume 7."
2,Half-Season at Full-Season Price,"Don't get me wrong, the 5th season of Family Guy is excellent. But the way Fox markets the Family Guy box sets stinks. Instead of waiting to release an entire season in one box set, they put the first half-season into a box set that costs as much as a full-season.To combat this lunacy, I will no longer buy Family Guy box sets but will rent them from Blockbuster."
1,Will not be buying,"I will wait for these to be played on other channels in a year or two. Most DVD sets are a rip-off anyways unless you get them on some serious sale.I don't really know how much Seth MacFarlane has to do with the upcoming DVD-volume distribution, but I would bet my money that it has more to do with FOX try to make more money than anything else. I mean, who wants to watch TV anyways? Commercials ruin television!!!!Also, Family is getting a little predictable with their catch-phrase joke set-up line ""remember that time....(flashback)"" or ""that was almost as bad as the time...(flashback)""Whatever..I hope they keep making more episodes of course, but Volume 5 looks like a ridiculous money-making scheme..After all, these companies aren't in business to make us laugh, THEY ARE IN BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY!!!!"
4,FAMILY GUY RULES!!!,"Everyone who is saying this dvd is not worth it, but i disagree. You are getting new material never released on t.v. in every episode. Plus, you get to see the show uncensored. Paying about thirty dollars for the treat of watchng these shows isn't bad at all i think."
5,Great and as described,Shipping was fast and the dvds and case were just as described. Have not watched them yet but the dvds are scratch free. They are a gift for my husband for christmas and I know he will love them and I can get him to quit hogging up my DVR with family guy re-runs.
2,what happened????,"I love family guy, but i think that i have to agree with almost everyone elses review. Why did Fox split the season up again. I was soo disapointed when i got this season and saw that there was only two dvds, oh and an extra special dvd. What the hell is that????? I don't want some special dvd, I want my full three to four full length dvds. I do feel like i got ripped off!!!!! And what in two or three months they will release another dvd to finish the season??? Lame, lame, lame!!!!!"
2,"very funny, but over priced","I really enjoyed the episodes from this season, but I am annoyed that they are charging the standard volume price for fewer episodes. I hope the price is eventually reduced because I won't buy this on principle and I would like to keep a complete collection of all the Family Guy volumes."
5,Two Thumbs WAY Up!!!!,First of all I love the Family Guy. So buying the 5th season was a must for me. I love popping in a dvd when ever I've had a bad day. Its sure to put a smile on my face.
4,"Family Guy, Volume 5",It was very good. I think that the overall shipping took a little longer than I expected but it came ok.
1,Will not be buying this volume!,I love Family Guy. I own every season on DVD. But I will not be buying this volume.It was understandable that they split Season 4 into two separate volumes--it made the season numbers and the volume numbers identical.But splitting Season 5 into two separate volumes and charging more for one volume than a previous entire season costs is just greedy.You will not be getting any more money from me!
5,quit your b1thcin,"who cares if its split up into 2 sets? if youre a real fan, youll still buy it. get them the mney so they can keep the show going."
2,Family Guy jumped the shark long ago.,"This series should not have been brought back to TV, The network guys were right and all the fanatics wee wrong. It's so stale and cliche. Each episode on this is a rehash of everything they've done before."
1,FULL price for HALF a season,Buying half a season for what you would pay for a full season of any other show just encourages the jackasses who put this together to do it again. Wait until the price drops then buy.
1,I've gotta echo the negative sentiments here,"I think the show is still quite funny, and almost all of the episodes in this set are worth having, but come on. Thirteen episodes for $40? That's absurd. Especially for a show that owes its resurrection to supporting fans and DVD sales. This is a spit in the face. They should be selling 4 discs for the price of two, not the other way around. They should be making Dane Cook look like Kurt Cobain as far as fan appreciation goes. They shouldn't be selling a three-disc set (that should, by all rights be a two-disc set, as the third is entirely special features that would've fit onto the other two quite easily, thus saving the packaging fees) for an outrageous sum. This is another egregious misstep after the ""movie"" debacle, in which they strung three episodes together, tossed a few curse words in, and marketed it as an uncensored, saturnalian romp. It's ridiculous and unfair."
3,Hilarious but only 13 episodes? No way man!,"Family Guy Vol. 5 is as hilarious as ever but what's certainly not funny is the price. For a retail price of $39.99 you get just 13 22-minute episodes making it a not-so-good deal. Sure quality is more than quantity, but quantity still counts. Regardless this volume contains some very funny episodes but you may want to the consider the overpricing before you buy it."
1,Your Welcome!!!,"I was a huge fan of Family Guy and I was until recently. I have my reasons, but here we go:Since Family Guy came back, the jokes have been horrible. The episode where Peter's dad dies is just awful. That was fine, I can deal with some subpar episodes, but how much is this DVD for that amount of episodes?Eric Cartman was right. Family Guy must be stopped. Wait...Lets just place the blame on Fox. They cancelled 3 great shows in their prime...Arrested Development, Futurama, and Family Guy. Plus they charge up these DVDs...Fox is just a horribly run network."
4,THIEVES AT FOX!!!!,"The reason for the full price for half a season is simple. When Fox realized they made a mistake when they cancelled it, they basically begged the creator to come back. The show was already picked up by Cartoon Network, so McFarlane raked Fox over the coals to get as much money as possible. And I don't blame him a bit. In an effort to recoup some of their losses, Fox decided to split the seasons to double their profits. Why do you think the first 3 seasons were NOT broken up? Because the show was not picked up by anyone yet. Typical Hollywood theivery, plain and simple."
1,Lame.,"I have purchased the previous family guy DVDs. I have noticed they are cutting the quantity of episodes in half per DVD set. Therefore I am getting only half the product I expect and paid for.I will not be purchasing this volume for this reason and will rely on my sources to obtain the product...""legally"" :)"
2,"Great show, Bad price!!","I only give 2 stars to Family Guy, not because of the show but because of the price. I don't understand why these companies are splitting up the series the way they are. It's not right. I would gladly pay a little more for the whole season of Family Guy. It's become a money thing with some of these companies. They really need to start paying attention to the consumer because they are going to lose big if they keep cutting these shows in half. Just read some of the reviews. It's not the show that people are unhappy with, it's the fact that they are being split up & the cost of half of a season that's the problem. Other than that I really enjoy Family Guy, It's a funny show."
4,"Great content, but I still feel gipped","I've been a long time fan of Family Guy. This has resulted in me purchasing every season on DVD since their respective releases. I saw volume 5 for under $30 and thought I was getting a bargain. Unfortunately its only the first 13 episodes of the season. I purchased it under the impression that I was getting an entire season, but they neglected to include the last 5 episodes for reasons unknown. I won't rate it a one like others for something like that as the content itself is still great. I do feel like I was robbed though. Purchase it if you're looking to complete your set."
5,Wet Ones-Order Rather Than Do Without,"We have been faithful to the use of Wet Ones Flushables Personal Cleansing Wipes for at least sixteen(16) years, as no similar products even compare. Based on their moistness, fragrance, user-friendly containers, my husband, a double amputee(right arm and right leg), from the Viet Nam War depends on them as part of his personal hygiene. When we moved from FL to MD three(3) years ago, we found Wet Ones Flushables very difficult to find. Now that source has dissipated; we decided to purchase on-line at Amazon.com. Please keep marketing them."
2,boo,for the price there are better wipes in the store. these smell nice but are overly wet and small in size.
4,Not for the faint of heart,"I agree with the 5 star reviews that this is the best weight loss book now on the market. My reservation is that this is therapy. You must be prepared to be completely honest with yourself, to journal about your feelings, and your relationship to food, and how and why you got in the fix you're in. The book opened a real can of worms for me, and did so for my sister, and neither of us was prepared to go so deeply into the issues. I guess that's why previous diets have failed us! If one is truly ready to do the work, this book is the only tool you will ever need. The approach is encouraging and gentle, but the emotional baggage that comes up can be difficult. I think this book would be most safely used in a support group."
2,Blah!,"I didn't like it...it didn't have enough writing space. I also didn't like any of the different types of journals, they seemed to be all over the map!"
5,Perfect Christmas present for Nana,Came in time for Christmas and my grandma loved it! It fits great on her stove. Makes a good cup of English Breakfast.
4,Gave as a Gift,"My daughter asked for a ""good tea pot"" for Christmas. After much searching, and realizing that ""tea kettles"" can be a dissertation project, I finally settled on this one. My daughter is pleased and says that it is ""just the right size"" for a couple and does everything it says it can do."
3,"Fine, but needs babying","When did teakettles become such delicate creatures? The instructions on this item recommend that you heat it on a ""medium low"" flame, and that's what you have to do in order to avoid scorch marks on its sides. The top is a bit of struggle to remove, and the handle's placement makes it a challenge to fill with water. Be sure to exert strong pressure to close that top, as well, or it will pop off as you pour the boiling water, giving you a nasty steam burn. In short, this kettle has more quirks than I'd like for 35 bucks."
4,best stove top tea kettle,"I read a lot of reviews and went to stores to look at the construction of the available tea kettles, and I have found this one to be an excellent choice. it is well made, the interior is also enamel-lined, and it has a secure top and heats water quickly. It is easy to keep clean, and the action to open and close the spout is sturdy, it does not feel like it is going to fall apart. Oh yes, it does whistle! very loud if ignored so no chance of forgetting it on the stove! I think the quality is what stands out the most for me."
2,"as dylan said himself, it's not great","It's bluesy and funky here, rocks there, now again is sweet. But it's nothing great. I listened once and probably won't again."
3,Weak Link In The Trilogy,"I waited like a kid at Christmas for this disc to be released. I was so convinced by the hype and the fact that Mr. Dylan had a few years to put into this that it would be the crowning achievement of his return to roots/americana music. Man, am I disappointed. The music is well played and well recorded but never comes off as anything other than tepid. Worst of all the great poet fails to rise to the level of the musicianship. This must be the least lyrically interesting album of his career. That being said, it's nice to have new Dylan. But in all honesty there's no revelation to be found. I'm already waiting to see what comes next."
1,...theft ?,Why is Dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ?Shame on you Bob.
1,So many people hate this album. That must mean something.,"This is boring music and the lyrics are 80 percent filler. In fact, I hate this CD. It's pathetic. The songs are too long. They're boring. Take a look around at how many people despise this album. The rest are just idol worshippers trying desparately to find something to like about it. Bob could have released any rubbish and you idol worshippers would give it five stars."
3,disappointed in Dylan,"I actually enjoyed the music, hearing some old classics done in the Dylan style along with the new tunes...but my complaint is when I read the liner notes and saw that Dylan took credit for writting all the songs! Please, tell me he is not that hard up for money that he does not want to give the true composers their royalties...granted they are no longer among us, but their families are! J.A. Lane [Jimmy Rogers]& McKinley Morganfield [Muddy Waters] must be ""Rollin' & Tumblin'"" in their graves...or maybe saying ""That's All Right"" Bob, ""Someday Baby"" we'll meet again..."
3,Not the Old Dylan,"I bought this from reading some of the reviews thinking I was getting some good ol' Bob Dylan music. Not so. My husband and I have been big Dylan fans since the 60's. The songs are just little diddies with no edge to them. The only one that we liked was ""When the Deal Comes Down"""
5,His Best Yet,"I have been a Bob Dylan fan since the 60's. Hard as it is to imagine, this is trhe best of him that I have ever heard. I can't stop playing it."
5,You will laugh and cry,"This is Dylan in top form. Brilliant lyrics. You will laugh out loud at some songs, and cry at others."
5,Simply Beautiful,Here comes along another wonderful album which was well worth the wait and sure to please any Dylan fan. He has certainly found his mojo these last ten years.The highlight of the set is a truly beautuful track- Workinman Blues #2. which will make you melt with a fine vocal performance and a great lyric. This is album that will go over well in concert. No reservations with this album at all!The DVD could have be packed a bit more footage - a tad short for the extra amount.
2,Feel Guilty For Not Liking It...,"I keep listening to this CD hoping to start liking it. I readily admit that I am in the minority, but I don't get this album. To my ear, it sounds like one long, monotonous song from start to finish. When I am playing it in my office, and people walk in and hear it playing, they usually ask ""What the heck are you listening to? It stinks."" It sounds a little like Bob is about to keel over and die. As a fan of his from the 60s, I feel stupid for saying this, but maybe it is time to retire. I'll keep listening and keep trying to like it..."
3,Disappointed,"Upgraded from 1 star. The comments below were my first impression. The album actually grew on me.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Just heard about this album from a lady who loved it- she said, ""He even sings."" The sticker on the wrapper said Rolling Stone called it a ""Master Work."" Very exciting. Not.I'm Dylan's biggest fan, and this sucks. I never thought I would write something negative about a man whose songs and singing I've defended my entire adult life. Not folk, not rock, not blues, but LOUNGE MUSIC (of all things). Drums and Cymbals. Words that go no where. The kind of beat you want to turn the bass down on. It's what you hear through the wall from an annoying neighbor. Find a pillow and bury your head under it.How could Rolling Stone mis-lead us so? Useless.Bob, play us a tune on the old guitar, with finger picking and hammer-on's. Where's your harmonica? And, what about being an American in Modern Times? Is God on our side?"
1,"One star because it IS Dylan, afterall","This was a complete and utter disapointment. Almost as bad as his self-serving autobiography--poor, poor Bob. Unless he can come up with something different, he needs to just fade into the past when all of his best work was made. This album sounds like retreads of some of his less inspiring cuts with little, if anything to say."
1,bonus DVD is a DUD,"I grew up listening to Bob Dylan, and was really looking foward to hishis new DVD, Modern Times, and was really disgusted when i tried the bonusDVD in two dvd players i have,and lent it to a friend to try,and neitherone of us could get it to play.I should have returned it,but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play,as stated,i was just disgusted.I desided not to order any more music DVDs from Amazon.I must say that themusic on the first DVD was great,starting with Thunder On The Mountain,itwas good to listen to some new Dylan."
1,Horrible album - am I insane?,"After reading glowing 5 star reviews calling this a masterpiece, I got this album and listened. I am an old Dylan fan from way back and old and middle Dylan is one of the things that makes me truly happy and I know every song, every line, every story, every story behind the story, so on to Modern Times. After several listens, I couldn't stand it. The lyrics meant nothing and were so trite that they were Kevin Federlineish. The music sounded so cold and emotionless, like a band I'd never listen to again. And all the songs sounded dead, like garbage maybe from Nick Lachey or someone like that. But Dylan? He should send me a refund, and also pay me for pain and suffering. I suffered listening to this. I'm also wondering if I'm insane, since everyone else praises this album so highly. Or maybe these are just the masses who keep the Olive Garden in business, thinking they serve real Italian food, and who voted for Clinton, thinking he was someone to respect."
3,Good for a frog,"3 starts for: well written songs and music, good musicians but this guy has a voice like a frog. He can't sing, why not hire a surrogate singer that can actually sing? Maybe in the 60's and 70's he could pull it off, but Dylan definatly can't sing worth a damn anymore! The vocals are painful to listen to!"
2,Things Ain't Going Well,"After 4 spins, I've decided that this is not my favorite of Dylan's work. The only track with which I somewhat connect is the final track ""Ain't Talkin'"" where the somber mood seems portend a revelation, ""They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me mother; In the human heart an evil spirt does* dwell, I'm trying to love my neighbor & do good to others, but oh mother, things ain't going well."" The rest of the songs have almost no melodies with arrangements that blend from one into another. This week, Bob's son Jakob's ""On Up the Mountain"" is #1 in my personal top ten. Seeing Things is a far superior set to ""Modern Times,"" if it's fair to compare. At this point, Dylan can of course do whatever he wants and it will be published; but this is his weakest set in quite awhile. Because it is Bob Dylan, it will have an honored place on my shelf, which I will faithfully dust from time to time. Taxi!*according to my ear"
5,Every Song a Winner,"Absolutely love this album. Was never a real big Dylan fan but this album has changed my view. Love every song on it. He has stayed true to his current generation and didn't fall prey to what sells to ""teenie boppers."" I look forward to see what he will do next."
5,Great Album,Dylan just keeps getting better. This album easily ranks as one of his best. There are so many good songs on the cd that it doesn't matter which one you play. Why this album was not up for album of the year at the Grammy's is beyond me. Justin Timberlake's album was better than this?...c'mon.
4,Modern Times,"Modern Times by Dylan's latest release is a very good record. Modern Times became Dylans first #1 in the U.S. since his 1976 release ""Desire"". There are many fine tracks on this record, i.e., Spirit on the Water, Someday Baby to mention a few. The book-let is very thin and contains no lyrics. The photograph on the cover looks like a shoddy work with photoshop but apparently Bob liked it. His lyrics are filled with religious allusions and I most say that I liked them alot. 4 well deserved stars!"
5,Modern Times,"This is fabulous! Every single song is brilliant - this has to be the best thing Bob has recorded since ""Blonde on Blonde"". I saw his concert in Sydney without having heard ""Modern Times"". Now I wish I was back there with the knowledge of these newer songs. I listened to the preview songs on Amazon and just had to get the CD immediately - which is pretty much how Amazon dispatches their CDs - even to Australia. Forget the ""4-6 weeks"" - I always get deliveries within 10 days, and usually cheaper than if I had time to trawl the shops here. I love the way you can listen, then buy, online. It's another life since I had to wait for the latest vinyl album to arrive from overseas! Thanks, younger generation! hehehe"
2,Bob was the poet of his time....,"Which has obviously passed. I can't imagine he needs the money so why is he recording this stuff? What this CD doesn't need is another review-159! But here's mine anyway-first off-I have never been a Dylan fan (his voice grated on me) and in my youth only bought and liked Blood on the Tracks. My husband, on the other hand is a fan, and he thinks this album sucks. Well-it is nothing special for a formerly brilliant poet (and is basically reeking with co-dependent lyrics-the world doesn't need more of those-Country provides enough)although I agree with the other folks that think his voice has improved with age. I gave it 2 stars because it isn't a bad listening album, it is just a bad Dylan album. And I was hoping I could convert."
3,i wanted to like it,"but, well, it's somewhat boring. seems dylan is stuck in a kind of americana realm and... it's not exactly bad but, like love and theft, all you get are nice good old time tunes. a looong way from it's alright ma or subterranean homesick blues. if dylan was dylan right now, he would address the political situation of the usa in at least 1 song. instead, we get ragtime romantic stuff that sounds like the soundtrack of a retro movie. the cowboy hat and all... the comfort of an artist who seems isolated.(i'm a big dylan fan...)"
2,just ok,"this album has some decent instrumentation&Dylan has a lyrical moment or two,but on a whole this album is missing that one or two tracks where you want to hear it again&again. i got to hear this album recently&was thinking maybe this might be at least pretty good,but it didn't hit the mark. good to hear him still doing his thing though."
1,Out of any new ideas..,"Time Out of Mind and Love an Theft were excellent, this CD just sounded like he took all the bad outtakes from those sessions and put them on a single disk. The only ""ok"" song is Workingman's Blues #2."
1,Well documented copycat crud,"I know Dylan used to steal melodies way back in his early career, but I can't believe he has gone back to that practice. I won't go into the details, as a search on any internet search engine will give you the track by track details. But the fact is, most of this album is made up of songs that were - at least in part - taken from other artists and not credited to them. I don't give a darn if the songs entered the public domain, he should not have lied and said ""all songs written by Bob Dylan"" because they aren't"
3,The Bottom Line,"This just isn't nearly as good as Time Out Of Mind. These songs don't carry that much melody, and there's no cool production effects by Daniel Lanois, since he's MIA. Just Dylan going through the same old motions, much as he did during the 1980s. This is not a 1-2-3 punch (following Time Out Of Mind, and ""Love And Theft,"" which was released on 9/11), it's just Dylan filling out his contract obligations. FIVE years we've been waiting for this? I expected much better. Also, his voice sounds particularly raspy here. I thought this album was kind of boring, since there is not one standout song here. Better luck next time, Bob."
2,"eh, so so","Sounds just like the last record if you ask me. Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with. God bless him."
4,New Music,"Anybody who knows anything about Dylan knows that it's foolish to campare ""Freewheelin'"" with ""Blood on the Tracks"". Might as well ask which is better, Shakespear or Michaelangelo? Apples and oranges. I started with ""Slow Train"" and kept buying Dylan, lookin' for that same sound. I discovered the artist.This is a good album. It's good Dylan. Buy it.Much has been made of the infleunces that run through the music. Listen to it first. It is a thing by itself. Then read the volumes of reviews on the net. That's good for a laugh!"
5,A Different Kind of Dylan,"This was the first Dylan I bought/listened to since his music of the 60's. His sound is completely different but I like it just as much. His voice is real scratchy and raw. But lets face it....Dylan was never know as a great singer. I love this CD. It is so different from not just his music but others as well. Plus every song is long. Thunder on the Mountain is a foot-stomping song. I could see it being used for line dancing - not that I would know since I have never done that or seen it. Each song is a story. he Levee's Gonna Break, Spirit on the Water, Rollin and Tumblin are all great. Every song is great. This CD reminds me of a group who is still hungry trying to make it big and does a knockout performance. Dylan is like a Van Gogh of music. He may not have the best voice play the best instrument but what he puts on a recording strings a chord with the listener. It is how he ""sees"" the music that makes him great."
4,The Bob Dylan of today!,"I'm no Dylan expert, but this album is just extraordinary. It's the first of his I've gotten since Oh Mercy and might be my favorite of his EVER. The quality of songs is very high, and the whole album is very consistent. I've played it countless times and it just doesn't get old. Highlights are the opener, the closer, and everything inbetween. Seriously. I've seen him live twice in the past 4-5 years and it's been...alright. He's hard to understand live, and both shows I saw tended to drag a bit. Not here. Crisp, clear and very enjoyable. Decades in the ""biz"" and still on top. What would we do without him, Springsteen and Neil Young? Step it up youngsters."
2,The times they are a-changin',"I wonder where is all the philosophy encripted in the song which title I've used to present this critic. He, Dylan, is on the old road and doesn't move an inch and doesn't help in the new one.OK, OK, I like these songs, a wonderful backing group and a horrible voice which never sounded good but never sounded more bad than now. Years before at least he could keep on key, but now...He's a myth, that's all. He should sing only for his devotees."
1,What a mistake!,"No voice at all. No real sense of timing. Some old man groaning on in some horrific gravelly voice, and this is supposed to be the blues. Worse than the Christmas album...same sort of thing, which is to be expected I suppose, but blues instead of Christmas music. I wish radio stations would quit playing this garbage. FWIW some of the songs are pretty good, and if someone with some ability had performed them, I might like them, but Dylan is awful."
2,Silly Love Songs,"When one of the most gifted writers alive simplifies his life into a series of unending lost love songs, while all around fires burn in the streets of the world, it isn't that the songs are good or not, it's that they take up the space that other, unwritten songs should fill.Robert Zimmerman became Bob Dylan because he showed us a world few others could. Now, Bob Dylan, stands aside and flips through the channels.Reruns."
3,I Haven't Heard It,"I think this album might be okay, because it features the famous Bob Dylan. But I haven't heard it, so I'm not sure. It might not be so good. Hope this review helps."
1,JUST DIE ALREADY!!!,"Bob Dylan is one of the worst artists of all time. His voice sounds like an old man's, his lyrics make about as much sense as a meth trip, and he cannot shred or do guitar solos. And where is he on MTV? This guy really needs to kick the bucket.Oh, and I hear that he's making a new album. Great. Kurt Cobain died early yet this man is still ticking. Forget his new album, get the upcoming Limp Bizkit album instead. It's going to kick major azz."
1,This is bad.,"This is the worst music that I have heard in a long time. It's time for Dylan to retire. Dylan, along with Sonny Bono could never sing. The only reason Dylan got a recording contract back in the 60's was that there was a hippie movement that accepted just about anything with the thinking that anything goes. Although he had a few good ones back then that he managed to make sound good, the truth is he couldn't sing back then and he certainly can't now. He couldn't hit a high note or a low note because he just never had the lung capacity to carry a tune. With this album, his voice is so weak, he is just kind of talking to music. Ah, the times they are a changing."
3,Something of a disappointment,"I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed with ""Modern Times"". The lyrics aren't as personal and emotional as ""Time Out of Mind"" nor as imaginative as ""Love & Theft"". This album suffers from being good, but almost never great... from consisting of utterly solid performances that somehow never rise above a sort of tepid level of passion or feeling. All that being said, it is always nice to have some new Dylan and ""Ain't Talkin'"", ""Working Man's Blues"" and ""Nettie Moore"" are great. Bob's singing is more sensitive than I've almost ever heard it and the mood is more optimistic, which is interesting. It isn't a masterpiece, despite what so many reviewers are saying, it just isn't. But it is good enough and as the third album in the so called ""trilogy"" it forms with it's predecssors, it certainly is true that Bob Dylan has experienced a true creative resurrgence after his lull in the late eighties and early nineties."
5,What A Great Album!,"This is one of my favourite Bob Dylan Albums. I have enjoyed this album over and over. The first two songs are obvious crackers, especially Thunder on The Mountain, but When the Deal Goes Down and Workingman's Blues #2 I really like as well. The real slow burner for me is Nettie Moore. That is a great song! Of the so called recent ""Trilogy"", I think I prefer Modern Times the best. Really, to be honest, I've always enjoyed any of Bob Dylan's records. The Christian albums are some of my favourites and very under-rated in my opinion. He was right back on track with most people with ""Infidels"". I started with ""Blood on The Tracks"" (lucky me!) and I think I've got my fair share of good times from Bob's efforts over the years."
5,The best album of 2006,"John from Cleveland has placed the best review I have seen on this site, so I will just add my own opinion. This is without a doubt the best cd of 2006, and will stand the test of time.I find myself listening to it at least once a month. Considering that I own at least 1,000 cds, that is saying something. My favorite track is ""Nettie Moore"" but I consider the whole album brilliant. It is some of the finest roots music I have heard in a long time."
4,Dylan Endures,"This album shows that creativity and taking risk remains strong with Dylan as displayed in the wide spectrum of music he gives us.... hillbilly rock, country, folk, etc. Thunder on the Mountain is literally a great ""driving"" song..... crank'er up!"
5,Modern Times by Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan and those memories. A good CD for the older generation and the ones who can appreciate good music.
4,Another Winner For The Master,"The man who took music in groundbreaking directions several times chalks up another great album with ""Modern Times."" While his voice has not aged well and has gotten very gravelly, he still delivers his own material better than anyone and his song writing talents are as strong as ever. He mixes various musical styles from Chuck Berry to Howlin' Wolf to wistful waltz time. This is definite Grammy material and a few notches above his previous release ""Love And Theft."""
5,I agree...,"I laugh, I cry, I listen in awe. People who criticize, I'm curious what their 5 star might be...probably some ""5 star"" album they've written that hasn't found a second ear. Keep it up BD."
5,Wonderful,"What can I say, its a wonderful album. I've listened to it over and over. He just seems to get better as the years go by.sue"
4,Cowboy Band,"""I'm in a cowboy band,"" goes one of the lyrics on this most interesting of albums. This is a cowboy band album, a la Bob Wills, albeit fused with Dylan's quirky lyricism. It's a mix of boogie/shuffle/railroad blues with some drum-brushed, waltzy lilts that cry out for a megaphone and ukelele. It's a little early to tell if there are any masterpieces on it; certainly nothing approaching ""Things Have Changed"" or ""Love Sick"" from the recent past. There are some missed opportunities for signature guitar solos, though the early 60's guitar punctuation is enjoyable and refreshing. The opening track, ""Thunder on the Mountain"" is probably the best rocker, and ""Nettie Moore"" the most soulful. I'd like to be drunk in some roadhouse, punching these tunes up on the jukebox."
3,"Product was so,so",The orange scent was not as strong as I expected it to be. This is the first product of its type that I have ordered. Not sure if I would order again.
1,Not going to waste my time on this review,"I needed quite a few locks for my luggages to Europe, and I tested these locks before putting them on however I didn't have time to go buy any other ones. I ordered two sets (orders) and out of EIGHT of them only one lock was not able to open with a paper clip, knife, or another key. Though I still used them, I also tied them down with a zip tie through the holes of the luggage zippers and lock.I threw them away once I got to Europe."
2,Not Very Secure,"I recently travelled out of the country and wanted to leave my suitcases locked in my hotel rooms with valuables. I guess they serve as a visual deterrent only, but for real security they are worthless. I locked the one of the keys in the suitcase at one point and easily popped it open with the back of a spoon. For real security I will look elsewhere next time."
5,Great under pressure,"Bought these for a 2/2010 trip to Mazatlan, Mexico. They worked great. On the return at the Mazatlan airport you are required to open ALL bags, even bags to be checked in. Some had trouble opening combanation locks as some felt pressured by airport security to open their locks. Others had several keys for different locks. I just needed my one key to unlock the 3 locks I was using. No pressure! Had no problems with any of the locks but only needed to use 3. Best deal for the price."
2,Not so easy,"Took the locks to Asia where they are required. Bought them because they are ""TSA approved."" The key is very hard to get into the lock but if you try long enough and with more than one key you can get it open."
5,They're locks. For luggage. They work.,"You get four locks and four keys. They're pretty standard. I used them on a checked backpack for a recent international trip. Nobody in airport checking or security had an issue with the locks, so they passed that test. The locks were a tad bit smaller than I thought they'd be, but that's not really a problem. They seem pretty sturdy and are cheap, so I think they're quite good enough for your luggage-locking needs."
3,Broke/Jammed On First Trip,"I purchased this set of four for a vacation this summer and one of the locks got jammed and I had to have the hotel cut it off. The bag had a ""TSA inspected"" sticker on it so it is possible that they jammed/broke it, but considering these locks are supposed to be TSA-Approved I would not have expected them to be so sensitive to the TSA use."
2,Lasted only a few days,Was happy to find a 4 pack that was reasonable but unfortunately one stopped working instantly and the other 3 only made it through the trip there. The entire top popped off one but was still usable. You had to be careful opening it as it would shoot across the room. For the money- they are good for a short trip but ours was a month long and they were useless by the end of the trip and left at our destination.
2,REALLY?,"Ordered the 4 lock set, locked our bags and upon arrival unlocked them.. Went to lock one of the locks and it will not lock other 3 just fine. First time used. Not happy with Amazon's replacement policy!"
2,poorly designed,when opening the package i discovered that one of the keys was already bent and two of the locks are so rigid that i needed to get pliers to turn the key in the lock
3,Two good out of four,"Right off the bat, two of the four locks did not fully lock... No, they did not pop open, but the bolt that is supposed to engage the cut on the hasp did not do this, evident by a popping sound when pulled on and a lot of movement of the hasp when ""locked"". In this situation, you are totally relying only on one part of the system, and this compromises there already low level of strength. I will say Master Lock was very good about very quickly replacing the defective locks, and even offered to pay for the return shipping. I guess if you get four good ones, then for the price and expected level of protection they can provide, they will do the job."
1,Waste of Money,"TSA locks are a waste of money. I had one, and it lasted one trip. TSA took the lock off, but didn't put it it back on. So, locked bag to security, and bag with no lock after coming out of baggage claim. Why bother? If you really need a lock, lock your bag before the airport and after it comes out of baggage claim. You can use a better, more secure lock then."
1,Why bother?,"So what if a lock is TSA approved? On a recent trip, I was informed that the locks on my checked bags would have to be left unlocked. When I picked up my luggage at my destination, some of the locks were missing and the remaining locks weren't locked. What a waste...save your money!"
5,Best tiny locks ever,"With hundreds of applications and ""pervertable"" options, these are a must for any ""adult toybox"".Strong, sturdy, and reliable, these will come in handy for many different ""scenes""."
4,Great for the price,"So far I am happy with the lock, I used for several international flight and it is working fine yet"
3,A visual deterrent only,"All small locks are usually flimsy, so knowing this in advance these locks are really just something to keep your luggage safe and closed for the few hours that it's out of your possession. I wouldn't trust my valuables with these, but they offer the ""visual deterrent"" that should keep most thieves away, or at least have them looking for easier bags. Locks keep the honest people out ..You get 4 locks and 4 keys (all interchangeable) with this set. Keyed alike kits are extremely nice. Since you don't need to carry all of the keys, you can leave a few of the keys behind, split them between fellow travelers, or send one ahead through the mail so that it's waiting just in case you lose yours during travel. Unfortunately, one of my locks arrived damaged. The key is hard to insert, gets stuck once in, and as you are inserting the key the lock will simply pop open. Masterlock has a lifetime warranty, if you can find it on their website."
1,Don't buy unless only expecting 2-3 of the locks/keys to work!!!,"After opening and trying them out, there was 1 key that didn't work with any of the locks, and 1 lock that wouldn't open with ANY of the keys. Then, when I was still trying them out, one of the locks that had opened originally - wouldn't shut and re-lock. You'd press it down and instead of clicking and holding shut, it just pops open again. Really regret this purchase."
3,Very good,"I like placing several locks on my luggage to prevent thievery. They work very good. The sad thing is that the people who are now stealing from you luggage is most likely the TSA agents. By using several locks and locking the interior partitions in opposite locations inside the luggage, it makes it more difficult for the thief to rifle through you luggage to find something of value."
3,Lower-End Locks,I have only used these locks once and thus far they've done the job however I do agree that they feel very cheap and flimsy. I expected them to be heavier like the other TSA lock I've purchased in the past but these are significantly of a lower quality. Buy at your own risk!
5,TSA approved,"Recently received my locks and had the chance to use them. I was asked by TSA agent if I had locks on my luggage? My reply was ""yes,approved by TSA""Agent replied ""great we can handle that if needed "". Upon arriving at my destination hotel,I unlocked/opened my luggage. Inside one was a tag from TSA saying my bag was opened and inspected. Lock was replaced on luggage. I really felt secure that I was able to lock my checked luggage and would have no issues/problems with TSA if needed to be opened. Wish I knew sooner that these locks were available from Master Lock. Great product and looks good."
5,TSA APPROVED BAGGAGE LOCK,"I got the master lock keyed alike 4 pack and was very satisfied because I was able to check my baggage without any hassle or delay. When I arrived at my destination I found that they were still secure, while some other passengers who did not use TSA approved locks were cut to be inspected."
2,2 out of the 4 locks are garbage,"I wanted TSA approved, durable locks for my luggage, so I chose the brand that I trust, Master Lock. These locks are extremely flimsy and are a shade better than those cheap little luggage locks that come with cheap luggage. This set comes with 4 master locks with 4 keys. 2 of the 4 locks work ok. The locking mechanism has a very rough action and sometimes when the key is inserted it doesn't turn. I even tried to lubricate the locks with lubricant that is made for locks but it didn't help as much as I thought it would. One of the locks broke immediately out of the box and doesn't lock anymore. A second lock seized on the first key turn.. Glad I tried these out before I put them on my luggage. These locks should not be carrying the Master Lock name as they are pretty cheap and flimsy.. I'm sure there are better locks out there for the same price or less."
1,"Flimsy, Cheap","I just got these, and broke through one without much tugging. The only positive i can think of is with overseas trips if you have a broken lock on your luggage, then you are sure its been tampered with. Most airlines wont honor a claim if you have already left the airport. Maybe having a broken lock on your luggage would be the easiest way to know you need to worry.I would not depend on these locks to secure ANYTHING!"
2,Dimensionally challenged,"IMHO, the listing is not clear enough about how small these locks really are. Anyone with a screwdriver, a pair of pliers and average hand/arm strength can pop these open in seconds. If the listing had been clearer about their diminutive size I would never have bought them - as it was I never even opened the pack, just returned them for a refund. If you need a tiny lock for something not valuable, this is the product for you."
2,for show only,"Serves the purpose of a TSA lock, but not much more. Can be easy open by any determined would be thief"
3,"They're ok, but very small shackle","These locks are ok, but the shackle is so small that I found they didn't work well for most of my luggage. This may have been my fault for not researching them enough, but buyers should check of this lock vs size of their luggage before buying.I ended up buying the Master Lock 4688D and was much happier with that product."
3,"Budget Lock set, crude, rough, works.","Pros: 4 Locks, 4 matching keys, convenient, price.Cons: The lock bar barely engages the body, I feel like a really strong twist might pop the lock open.The keys bind really bad, but that might just be a break-in issue. Most of the time the presence of a lock is all the security you need. Having 4 small locks that share a key is really cool. I hope that over time the lock/keys will break-in and be easier to use. Maybe some oil or light grease will help.-mike."
4,Fit the need.,"This lock fit the need. Nothing fancy, but it is strudy. It kept my suitcase closed. I liked that the key was made so that it fit on my key ring so that I was less likely to loose it."
5,master locks,these were great locks still have a few of them around for baggage but mostly for private matters we used these while in storage. good price for the 4 of them and good quality.
1,Don't Bother,I wanted to secure items and not fumble for 4 different keys. I may or may not have ever used them on a commercial plane. I was swayed by the brand Master Lock....must have been a Master reject. The shank was so thin I could bend it with my hands and it was so limited in range that aside from minor applications they are useless to me! The photos make them look bigger and more imposing than they are in person. I should have known for the price but......
3,These locks are ok....,"First off, the locks are tiny. The only thing they could possibly be used for are suitcase locks. The base is somewhat substantial but the shackle is the thickness of a pencil lead.Soon as they were delivered I tried all 4 keys in all 4 locks and only 2 keys worked in all 4. For my purposes that's fine but all 4 keys should work as advertised.Basically these should be ok as a visual deterrent for thieves but do not use for any serious valuables."
1,Poor Quality and 2 keys did not work,Poor quality - Two of the key would not work and the locks were of very poor quality. I discarded all four locks in the trash. I have bought many Master brand locks over the years and have always trusted this brand so I was very surprised at the poor quality of these. My confidence in this brand is definitely lost.
4,Great set of lock for the price.,4 locks for a little over 2 bucks a piece seemed like a great deal to me. The locks held for my trip to Las Vegas and couldn't tell if TSA opened and searched my bags or not but my locks weren't cut so I guess that's a good thing? I like the fact that the same there are 4 keys and the locks are keyed alike so I basically have 3 spare keys.
1,WORST PURCHASE EVER,"3 of the locks work. 1 of the locks, I finally got 1 of the keys in it(3 of the keys wouldn't work on it). After it was unlocked, I couldn't get it to re-lock...when I finally did, none of the keys worked on it for me. My husband got it to work by forcing it really hard into the lock pushing it on the kitchen counter. Not that stickers matter all that much, but they have come off all 4 locks so they are pretty ugly now too. Never used them either...straight from the package like this. Would have given it 0 stars, but that is no option. Save your money and get a different lock!"
2,Not sturdy,"Received 4 locks. One was broken upon receipt. Used 3 on a case for travel. One broke off, one bent, and one was ok."
3,The price justified,All keys did not fit into all the locks. I was surprised at the mediocre quality from Master Lock brand.
2,"Damn ordinary item, rusted and now working","3 out of 4 locks does not work, Locks are jammed and key does not go in! Don't know if the locks are actually TSA approved or they just put it like that! I donated all of them to hotel housekeeping guys! :("
2,Qualidade inferior,"Por conta das indicaes, comprei dois kits desse cadeado.No voo de retorno para o Brasil, a TSA costuma sempre romper os cadeados, achei que com uma série assim, eu no teria mais esse problema. Só que os problemas foram outros: um dos kits veio com uma das chaves quebradas; um dos cadeados veio com problema e no fechava.Os problemas no acabaram por aí, qdo cheguei ao Brasil, pela fragilidade dos cadeados, dois deles no aguentaram o processo de ""checagem"" da TSA, e apareceram completamente retorcidos.Em suma, no vale a pena!"
1,Very Poor quality,"The keys do not work with all locks as indicated. Sub-standard quality, the lock did not last a single trip and opened and fell off when rubbed against a few bags at the airport."
2,Not very Secure,"Three of the locks seem to work ok. One of the locks could be pulled open with little force and was useless. Probably ok for transport via airlines, not not a real security deterant."
3,Key stuck into lock,"When I received these locks, I did not expect them to be as heavy and as small as they actually were. And when I put them on locks on my suitcase, when I tried to open one of them with the keys provided, the key got stuck into the lock. As for the others, they worked as they were expected too. I traveled to Europe and never ran into a problem with security."
5,Good Lock,One key will open all the 4 locks. This was convenient for me since I had 4 baggage and I had to carry 1 key only.
5,The Unit,"The Unit is one our favorite series that we have ever watched. We had never heard of it until someone told us that if we loved the series 24 we'd enjoy the Unit too. We enjoyed watching Dennis Haysbert who played President Palmer in 24 because he is such a dynamic actor. He is one of the main characters of the Unit as Jonas who leads one of the covert groups. If you are looking for a series that will keep your attention, then the Unit is for you."
4,Hooked!,"I watched ""The Unit"" during its first season and liked it. The, due to various things going on, never got to watch it again. Recently, my wife bought me the 3rd Season DVDs, so I had to go buy the 2nd Season to know what was going on.I am truly hooked and hope more episodes/seasons come out soon. While those in the military will pick out a lot of glaring faults with the series, it still gets the ideas and points of military life across. But at the end of the day, I watch it for entertainment, and am always satisfied."
4,I'm Hooked,"I came across The Unit by accident and have been hooked ever since. The concept is great and makes you want to just get up and enlist.My only drawback is that the DVDs only play well on my PC. On my DVD player, the third and fourth episodes on all the disks don't play."
2,Not at all like season 1,"Season one was a good addition to our DVD-collection. Season two was a waste of money! If they can't come up with something better than this, they should cancel the whole series NOW."
1,Does not live up to First season at ALL,"Plot holes you can drive a truck through, they try to get too political with this season, you hardly get the same sense of danger, or secrecy as in the first. The wife angle is still annoying and I'm not sure why Mamet wrote a lot of the episodes they way he did. I would not recommend it."
2,Started with a Bang. Ended with a flop,"Undoubtedly season two picked up on the high note season one left off on. The home front portions that most complain about actually add dimension to the show. Without the home life portions the show would be boring, nothing but one battle to the next.My complaints are with how unrealistic the end got. I don't know if anyone has read Eric Haney's book ""Inside Delta Force"" but he tried to, at the end of this season, force feed people his crazy theory that the CIA and the particular organization portrayed in this series have some kind of miniature war going on. The fact is that the end of this season was a force feeding of human waste."
3,"Eh, kind of disappointed","I thought the first season was very good. However, Season Two seems to have been afflicted with a bit of political correctness, which has no place in a drama centered around America's most elite warriors. Hollywood liberals just don't seem to have any comprehension of reality or the measures that need to be taken to ensure our freedoms.A few episodes were outright unwatchable. I must make it known that I'm a veteran and tend to pick apart shows like this. But sheesh, enlisted people are NEVER addressed as ""Sir"", unless you're in boot camp. That's one of the most basic tenets of military courtesy. Enlisted people work for a living. :)"
3,Some Political Correctness Sneaks Into Season Two,"I would give season one FIVE STARS. This season saw some political correctness sneak into the show. There's plenty of that on every other tv show, The Unit used to be a safe haven from that.The best episode of the series so far, was the very first episode of season one.Still, there are some great episodes in season two."
4,Very good,I have always been a special ops fan due tot he fact I am in the military. I really liked season two
5,Awesome show,The first season was really good. But the second season is even better. The Unit is an awesome look at a different group of military group. Worth watching.
3,Incomplete Book?,"I was extremely disapointed in this book. It has NO buisness with the title it was given. There is an inconsistancy in the way he tells you to polarise the generator/ regulator on the ""A"" circuit from one page to the next and he tells you how to update and wire from a generator to an alternator, but he leaves out where to connect the last (white) wire. Should have been corrected before print."
1,Wired for Success: Auto Electrical Made Easy,"Having made the mistake of purchasing this...this...book, I strongly urge no one else do the same. It contains nothing that can be of use and Randy makes it a point to refer one to the ""instructions"" and ""diagrams"" that accompany various wiring products. Luckly I paid little for this waste of a good tree. Therefore I will use it along with kindling to start fires in my fireplace as I curse Randy this winter. I actually rate this book a zero - NO Stars!! Not even fit for the bird's cage!!!"
5,overlooked but now becoming classic,"If you are a fan of this type of music, then departures and landfalls is basicly the bible for anyone who loves midwestern emo. recorded all live and basicly perfect in every way. and hey! its cheap on cd. soon to be a collectable for sure. the lp sells for about 40 to 60 dollars these days at least. by far their best effort (i also own all their 7 inches and splits). Departures is the one to get, and their split with christie front drive.Also check out cross my heart, the same type of stuff to make your heart bleed all over the place."
4,Good book for beginning teachers or tech newbies,"This slim book contained little that I, as an experienced computer user and long-time teacher of science using computers in the classroom, found new or original. However, it does present what I consider to be a very solid, basic list of ideas for using the computer gathering dust in the corner of your room. Included in this book are such suggestions as using the computer for demonstrations, projecting the screen for large - scale instruction, and of course using the computer for grading and classroom management. References and limited instructions would be useful to a beginner as well. A good book for the new teacher or the old teacher who has avoided technology. For us experienced folks, beg or borrow a copy, then skim over it, for there's not much here that an old hand hasn't tried. Maybe your library or department chair should invest in a copy..."
1,nice hat but stinky,"The hat is fine, but when I received it it reeked of cigarette smoke which means it was a used product (not what I thought I was buying) or the person who packed it was a heavy smoker. Either way it was not wearable until it had been hung outside for over 24 hours. I like the hat but was disappointed with the condition of it when it was received because I usually am very happy with my Amazon orders."
5,A Great Non-Fiction Book for Young Readers and Pre-Readers,"This book is a very interesting short explanation of the processes involved in making blue jeans. It uses simple words, but is not a dumbed-down narrative. It's great for that budding process engineer in your household - the one whose favorite question isn't ""Why?"", but ""How?""The book is illustrated with a variety of stock photographs, many with children as the focal point. This helps grab and maintain youngsters' interest.Since blue jeans are a common item in most kids' lives, this overview of where they come from can serve as a springboard for many interesting discussions of where other everyday things come from.The book does contain some unfamiliar words, but at about one sentence per page, the book will not frustrate newer readers - probably 2nd grade level or advanced 1st grade level. It's also a great book for reading to younger kids.Highly recommended."
3,Break Out Your Lighters,"My instant hatred of The Datsuns debut made me sit up and take notice. This Australian quartet all with the surname of ""Datsun"" play goofy straight on rock and roll with no pretense or, it seemed, talent. Surely, these riff-heavy tunes with titles like ""Lady"" and ""MF from Hell"" were pulling my leg. Until the three chord vamp of ""Harmonic Generator"" reminded me of the beloved New York Dolls, and soon enough these ten songs kicked in like cocaine. They'll remind you of AC/DC, Kiss, MC5, Foghat(!), Alice Cooper, so many glorious crunchy 70's rock and rollers you'll be tempted to perm your hair, break out your lighter, and scream ""Hello, Cleveland""!"
5,Most Awesome,"I was a 10 years old in 68, so what I heard was top 40.....by the time I was a bit older to hear Humble Pie, all I knew was '30 Days in the Hole' and 'I Don't Need No Doctor'.......Then of course Peter Frampton 'Live' in 75-76....so hey man, this has the music that I grew up with and I loved, but somehow I went right through it. Hell, I didn't know that Peter Frampton was a major player, until I downloaded the album and listened. I kept saying I know that guy. I know that there is plenty of other tunes out there by 'Humble Pie' and I'll get there, but this is really the Definitive Collection.......I love it and the sound quality is damn awesome too............."
1,'remastering' doesn't sound any better...,"This cd claims to be 'remastered'. You would think that means it would sound better than previous releases. But it does not.. not at all. I bought this one, assuming it would have a better sound than the 1999 'Best Of' cd I already had. In fact, it sounds exactly the same. Don't bother buying if you have any old cd's of Humble Pie."
5,awsome,I am so glad to have this! it came to me in perfect condition! love that song 30 days in the hole!! I've heard all sorts of versions of that song and they do it the best awsome! I tell you awsome!
3,Not what I expected,"I've read a lot of books about paramedics and doctors and I think there are much better books out there. While the author talked about some of the lessons that he learned, he never went into any detail about any of the calls he went on. It was more like he was giving a list of what calls he had. So if you're looking for more interesting information about what paramedics actually do, this is not the book for you."
4,Good book. To the point,"I thought Bingham did a decent job on this book. I can't find anything else by him so it must be his freshman effort. Hopefully there is more to come. I like the way he sees other people and the faults within himself. We are not supermen/women in EMS and very few actually see it that way. This book was short, but I think I got the message of what he was trying to say. Probably could use a little more ""picture painting"" but it was not a bad effort at all. And inexpensive. Want to read the next edition....if there is one."
5,Cool glimpse into the life of a paramedic,"Loved this! The stories are nicely written..just the right amount of detail ...nice amount of sarcasm lol and plenty of honesty . The author shares personal grief..struggles, hardships, personal happiness..and everything in between... thus making this read all the better! Good job Bingham =)"
5,Great Read,Great book - very entertaining; not as good as the book First Blood but better than the movie First Blood.
4,the most relaxing way to end the day,Few pieces of music put you into such a state of relaxation after a hectic day. Sit back and just listen to thier awesome voices meld into one. Truly beautiful music.
3,Sounds Good but all in all it lacks points of interest,"This CD is pretty good, I don't understand a single word of the language it is being sung in and I still like the sound of it quite a bit. But it just starts to wear on me after awhile there's nothing all that stirring or powerful at any point in it. The Voices of Light album that was done for the Passion of Joan of Arc video seems to have a lot more power and emotion in it. Still I have to admire any group that can awaken such a renewed look at such old music and can truly make people realize how good this music was. The album definitely is excellent at times it just seems to get old quickly."
1,"ALL LOOKS AND NO TALENT, PONCE CANT CARRY A TUNE.","Carlos Ponce was brought into latin music for one reason, and one reason only...his looks. He was a popular soap star in his home country, than Emilio Estefan (Glorias Husband) molded him into the next Ricky Martin wannabe. Ponce has no drive, no passion, or voice. Just listen to ""Rezo"" it is just a latin dance mess with very poor vocals. An obvious look that packaging comes before talent. If you want Latin music than try Ricky Martins ""Vuelve"" or his latest ""Ricky Martin"", otherwise trash this one....a definite miss."
4,Great Combo of Dance and Romance,"While on vacation in Puerto Rico, I discovered this phenomenal singer, Carlos Ponce. His face was in every record store and on television. Despite the fact that he's an incredibly handsome guy, he's not just a pretty face. I listened to his CD in the store and bought it immediately. The combination of upbeat dance tunes mixed in with romantic ballads really makes it a great album to launch a career with. I especially loved the Rezo dance remix. I hit the repeat button on the CD player in my car, open the sunroof, and boogie all the way to wherever I'm driving. I can't wait for his next release--and I hope there's one coming soon."
5,Works perfectly,I purchased this monitor for a video survailance project. It worked perfectly right out of the box with no adjustment!
3,Room for Improvement,This is a great effort but perhaps a little more editing could have helped the endeavor
4,Pieces of dinosaur,"Most of the models in this book are modular: This means that you make the head and body sections separately and then glue them together. There is also some cutting involved, but only in one or two of the designs.The benefit of modular origami, is that it is possible to get more detail into the models and these dinosaurs really do look great once they are finished. They are quite easy to adapt, so you can put them in different poses.Another good thing about this book, is the scale chart at the back. This tells you, in centimetres, which size squares to use if you want to produce dinosaurs that are to scale with one another. So your Veloceraptor won't tower over your T-Rex."
5,Great Value,"The book I purchased. The Lighthouse Girls-Lizabeth's Story is in great shape and I thought the price was very reasonable. I will continue to check Amazon for books in the future. By the way, this series is very good, not only for teens, but adults too!"
5,holy smokes,"As a long-time JW fan, this is an amazing collection of oldies. I am sure that this is another one of his many packages chock full of the huge backlog of songs from his 'pre-success' days but my God what a good selection.The whole album burns from start to finish, couldn't recommend it more."
2,Be warned..,"This is another Fleetwood Mac live set where the sound is really bad. I'd only get this if you, like me, need to get everything Peter Green recorded. Some nice playing, but it's hard for me to appreciate it, since the recording quality is so distracting. Get the Boston or Shrine sets first! Personally, I thnk the Shrine CD is Green at his absolute best with some super confident playing and singing."
2,"Nice price, but Hermit crabs won't eat it.","I bought this product based on others' success reviews. The first night I tried to give my hermit crabs these, they wouldn't eat it. I tried again later and they haven't touched it. In my opinion if you have finicky hermit crabs like mine,I would not suggest purchasing this product. I guess I will stick to 100% cranberries bought at Walmart and some food that the local pet store gave me to try."
4,"TAKE A TRIP, AND NEVER EVEN LEAVE THE FARM","NINETEEN TRACKS, SEVENTYTHREE MINUTES & TWENTYFIVE SECONDS OF COSMIC PLEASURE. MR. PAYNE INVITES YOU ON A PERSONAL JOURNEY, AND BARES HIS HEART & SOUL THROUGH HIS WORDS AND MUSIC.PUT ON THE CD, STRAP ON A SET OF HEADPHONES...TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS, BURN YOUR FAVORITE INCENSE...SIT BACK, RELAX, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LET JOHN TAKE YOU TO PLACES YOU HAVE PROBABLY NEVER BEEN TO BEFORE.PAYNE""S WARM AND SOOTHING VOICE GENTLY GUIDES YOU ALONG THE MANY PATHS OF ""FLYING THROUGH THE SOUL"", TAKING YOU WILLINGLY ALONG WITH HIM DOWN THE ROADS OF HIS LIFE. IT IS A TRIP YOU WILL NOT SOON FORGET, AND ONE YOU WILL WANT TO EXPERIENCE,AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN. THIS CD JUST COULD BE WHAT YOU HAVE LONG SEARCHED FOR, BUT BEEN UNABLE TO FIND...UNTIL NOW."
5,Norteno 100%!,"Este CD se puede decir que es Norteno 100% porque Paco introduce cada cancion con el acordeon. Bravo a todos los muchachos de este grupo. Y a ti Paco, que bonita voz. Los quiere una fan del merititito Chihuahua, Chihuahua, MX."
4,4 stars,"It was too long and did not seem to be very resistant, but it looks very nice. Just 4 stars."
1,False advertisement.,"Ordered and received product in a timely manner. That's where the good parts end. Opened the packaging to discover PC133 sticks re-labeled as PC100. Normally, getting the better product is a good thing, but outright lying doesn't fare well with me. Upon attempting to return them, I was notified of their return policy which states that not only will I be paying for shipping (expected), but will also be subject to a **30 percent** restock and ""handling"" fee. Why should I be penalized for the action of others? After all is said and done, the entire process wouldn't be worth it. Never again. Avoiding this company in all future orders."
5,Great memory upgrade for an old B&W G3 Mac,I had only 512 MB (4 x 128 MB SDRAMs) and when 1 memory slot died the remaining 384 MB RAM could barely accomplish what the B&WG3 could do. Installing 2 x PC-100 256MB (512 MB) and retaining 1 x 128 MB (640 MB total) made this Mac speedier in day to day tasks.
3,"OK, but needs to be proofread","There are so many typos and incorrect references in this book that it needs a good proofreading. The basic information and presentation were good; however, for beginners the incomplete references and/or the inconsistencies make it difficult for a reader new to ColdFusion to grasp the concepts. I had some of my ""Introduction to ColdFusion"" class members scan the book and they suggested that it not be used until the errors were corrected.With that said, I found the format and sequence of information well done. A person familiar with programming that wants an introduction to Coldfusion would find what they want here. Clean it up and I would give this book a higher rating."
5,Bob the builder,Bob the Builder what more can I say. My grandson loves Bob and plays with all the time. Good buy!
1,You don't get what you see!,The shipping took the maximum amount of shipping time available and I did not recieve what the picture showed. It shows 4 boxed sets and I got 3 with some loose dvds. My box sets were also bent and the disks were loose inside the cases. The packaging was very poor.
1,More Mass Market Trash....,"The theme song was lousy written and performed. The animation looked bad, and the plot, well it did not have one. Nuff said."
2,thundercats review,"I ordered the complete seasons of the Thundercats in 2010 as a personal Christmas gift. I had two dvds so far out of the set that will not work in any of my dvd players and blu-ray player. I have a Xbox, tv-dvd combo, and a blu-ray player. I have watched Season 1 and Season 2. There may be more defective dvds within Seasons 3 and 4."
1,A real letdown to the series,"Wow - I have loved this series but this book stunk. I really had to force myself to read through it. What a letdown to a really great series. Absolutely NOTHING moved forward in this story. No movement in Flinx's mental powers, no movement in his relationship with Clarity (in fact she wasnt even in the book), no movement towards finding or using the weapon platform. You can skip this book and MISS NOTHING in this series. What a piece of CR*P."
1,"Wow, major letdown","I absolutely love Alan Dean Fosters work and I have followed the Flink/Pip story line with delight. Which makes this weak, thin story even more of a let down than if I had picked it up as a unknown author. I expected the usual ""on the edge of your seat"" writing and emotional angst that I enjoyed in the other stories and this one was nothing but one big ramble about balloon creatures and long names. The characters were thin and one dimensional, I learned more than I ever needed or wanted to know about AAnn mating strategies. The only reason this rates a space on my bookshelf is that I hate to be one book short of a complete collection of Mr. Fosters work. You can safely skip this book and not miss a thing."
2,A real let down,"As soon as I saw a new Pip & Flinx book, I immediately rushed to buy it, to find out what would happen to Clarity, what Flinx would do about the pending disaster from afar, and to see what sort of general mayhem Flinx could get into. Sadly, only the last of my three desires was met. As one reviewer pointed out, this book did absolutely nothing with regard to the first two items in my quest. As a sci-fi novel, it was entertaining with its unusual Jast life forms and an interesting Aann character, but clearly I don't think this was up to Foster's normally high quality work. It seems as though he had writer's block with regard to dealing with the BIG issues in Flinx's world, so he simply threw something together so he could issue a Pip & Flinx novel."
3,leaves you wanting a LOT more,"This book seems to be a chapter rather than a book. I grew up with Pip and Flinx. Maybe I just expect a better, deeper book. However, this is just not some Star Wars scholck, this is a Pip and Flinx book. I expect better and deeper ! I still look forward to the next ""chapter"" of which there is a preview in the book. Hopefully ""Running from the Diety"" will be much deeper and better."
1,stinker...,"I have loved this series. started reading the first books maybe 20 years ago... however, this sequel flat out stunk. for those of u who actually read a book before writing the review (as opposed to those folks who think paraphrasing the book cover jacket hype constitutes a review ) pay heed to this rating..."
5,Great Value,My 3 year old loves the Thomas shows and this is such a great value getting a wooden train that would normally sell for $13 and up along with the DVD. The DVD has some really cute episodes on it too!
4,A must for little Thomas fans...,"...but starting to conform a little too much to modern ""sensibilities"" for this grown up. The older, closer-to-the-original-story episodes are more fun, silly and nonsensical. By comparison, the engines' distinctive personalities are noticeably watered-down from the early episodes, and there is a lot less technical detail. We still love it, though. Beats the pants off Barney any day."
3,Stone Cold,"This book is aboute a young boy who is homeless in London. He got homeless because he didn`t want to live in the same house as hes mother`s boyfriend. He didn`t want to stay in Bradford were he lived so he moved to London. When he came to London he didn'know how he would survive, because he didn`get a job. After some days he met a homeless man, Ginger. Ginger and he became friends, and Ginger taught hem how to get some money. So what he did every day was to beg for money and at night to sleep on a doorway. After a wile ginger disapered, Then he found another friend Gail.I don't think that the book was so god because they used many difficults word that i didn`understand."
3,Good !,I am a Swedish English teacher and I think this book is good to read with younger high school students who are learning English as a second language. The students can easily relate to the issue of homelessness and the novel is also a great tool for introducing point-of-view to students who have never come across this technique before.
4,"""Stone Cold"" review by Vera Konieczny","In his novel ""Stone Cold"" Robert Swindells give the readers an exect idea of the problems and feelings of homless people. Their life is discribed in many details. It's about a yxoung boy, called Link who makes himself homeless because of his cruel stepfather. In London he comes together with a cruel, crazy man who wants to clean the streets by killing the homeless. The young readers can identify with Link and feel sorry for him in his hopeless situation. Only the ending of the book isn't very nice because its hard to believe. It makes you think about homelessness."
3,Stone Cold Review,"In my opinion every English teacher should add this book to the literature list, because it discusses themes such as prejudices towards homeless people. I think that we could show our pupils how to react upon homeless people, meaning that our first impression is not always the correct one. Therefore, I think that Stone Cold could be of great value in the English classroom. Furthermore, the novel has been written in clear and understandable language making sure that the readers will not find great difficulties in understanding what the book is about. Also the fact that the books shows you two different perspectives makes it even more fun and interesting to read."
3,YAL review Stone Cold,"For young adults this is avery exciting and realistic book to read, for me it was a bit too short. I did like the fact the book shows the points of view of two different characters which is also reflected in the writing style and layout. For EFL teachersvI would recommend using this book in the young adult class."
2,a new genre!,"this is quite a good read, although i disliked the genre.i read a lot of books, but i have never come across a book like this. it seems that a school assignment can bring you to a new type of book. i think that the two person narration is confusing! i had no idea what the two people were going on about!but in the end, it was worthwhile- it is an interesting read even though i couldnt read it all in one sitting- it was too boring!"
3,"""Stone Cold"" book review","The Novel ""Stone Cold"" by Robert Swiondells shows you a realistic example of live in the street. It tells you the story of Link, a youth, who is living on the street and also the strory of Shelter a soldier out of job, killing homeless kids, with the mission to clean up the streets of London. Robert Swindells makes you see the downward spiral you get when you live on street. The whole book is very interesting and thrilling. Only the end is too abrupd and short."
4,A fascinating read!,"I really enjoyed this book. Once you start, you can't put it down. It's a fast moving book and you get into it very much so! Another excellent book by Robert Swindells is 'Brother in the Land' also 'Daz 4 Zoe' which is a modern Romeo & Juliet story. 'Brother in the land' is about a nuclear war. All his books are fast moving and you never get bored. They are fascinating! Stone Cold gives you brilliant knowledge of how it is like for people living on the streets. I am 14 and we read these three books in our English class. I recommend anyone above 12 to read them. Stone Cold has made me realise how important EVERYONE on this planet is. I always drop some change in the homeless people's hands now."
4,"""I think the ending needed more concentration"".",Stone Cold was a brilliant book which I would recommend to anyone though I think the ending could do with a bit more concentration.
2,Stone Cold,"Stone Cold is a book about a boy living on the streets called Link and an ex - army guy called shelter is looking out for any homeless person and kills them. When Links only friend, Ginger, goes missing link is frightened that he msy be taken away too.This book is an ok book but in some places it can b really borin!!!!!"
3,"""Stone Cold""","The novel ""Stone Cold"" written by Robert Swindells in the year 1993 deals with the topic of homeless people.The first protagonist called ""Link"", he is 17-years old after he have left his home he discided to live on the streets in London.This book show the live outside on the streets and the relationships to other homeless people.This story is sectional in two parts, the second protagonist is called ""Shelter"" he is a ""killing machine"".In the book he is killing all these homeless young people.I find it easy to imagine all the parts in the story, but the language is difficult.To read the book alone it`s boring, in the class with other people it is interesting, this is my opinion."
3,good but expected,had to read the paper edditition in school for a state exam in third year . our class read it in second year. so i got the book on the kindle this march(third year) to refreah my memory.it was good but expected about link. gaul charachater was inportant but stuipid
2,Will absolutely cause anxiety to any adoptive parent.,"Caution:This Book should not be read by anyone either considering adoption or anyone who has recently completed an adoption! While the story is intriguing and at times gripping, it involves an international baby selling organization that commits the most heinous of all crimes in order to ""match"" very high paying prospective adoptive couples with their ""perfect"" baby. As the story unfolds, the reader is sickened and horrified by the callousness of this highly successful ""adoption agency"" juxtaposed with the vivid descriptions of depraved conditions forced upon orphaned babies in Russia.Overall, ""White Male Infant"" is a good mystery story which does alert readers to the very real and desperate plight of waiting babies and children all over the world. However, it also enacts every parents' (both adoptive and biological) worst nightmare and will absolutely cause anxiety to any adoptive parent. Read it with caution!"
2,Mystery,"The blurb was more interesting than the book itself was. An American couple adopt a Russian child, only he may not be Russian-born after all. So boring that I can't remember the end (though I skim-read about the last 150 pages). Couldn't grab my attention. (C)"
3,Parent's Nightmare,"Barbara D'Amato taps into every adoptive parent's nightmare with WHITE MALE INFANTE.There is big money in the adoption business for the perfect child that fits the specifications of the prospective parents.Dr. Dooley McSweeny and his wife love their green eyed, red-headed son from Russia, but when Dr. McSweeny discovers his child did not come from Russia there is only one other conclusion, he was stolen.Running parallel to Dr. McSweeny's search for the truth is an FBI agent and a journalist who have other agendas. Will the McSweeny have to return their child if the real parents are discovered?International intrigue, a strained marriage, and their very lives may rest on his discovering the truth.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
2,"Great Premise, Downhill From There....","I thought the premise of this book was terrific. What adoptive parent was doesn't worry and wonder about their child's background? But the book went downhill after a great start.Several other reviewers have mentioned the ""cartoonish"" characters and I have to agree.Too much of a downer for me, after a great beginning."
5,"The final great FNM album, this is hugely underrated","The main criticisms of this album are only valid if you're only interested in the 'classic' FNM releases featuring the great Jim Martin and prominent keyboards. There ARE keyboards all over the album, unlike some would have you believe...they're just not mixed to the foreground as in other FNM releases. It's a matter of personal choice and open-mindedness as to whether or not you'll enjoy it in comparison. Trey Spruance came up with fantastic guitar parts that are HUGE yet musical and complex, easily as good as (the excellent) Jim Martin's best work. And Mike Patton's vocals are astounding, and clear in the mix, unlike on other FNM releases where he's heavily processed or dripping in reverb (not that there's anything wrong with that!). And the SONGS are great! there's only ONE track i don't like, as opposed to when i listen to 'Album of the Year' which has just a few great songs..."
4,This album gets better with time,When this was first released 5 years ago I was one of the naysayers who thought this to be there worst work.I recently decided to give this a listen again and I must say this is clearly there most underated album.When I first listened to the gentle art of making enemies an Star A.d I hated them but as the years have gone on I genuinely enjoy them.This album makes me wish for a simpler time called the mid 90s
3,"Not even close to Angel Dust, Real Thing or AOTY","THe album is strange - some tracks (Evidence, Gentle Art, Digging the Grave, title track) are brilliant, while the rest is trash. Looks like on this album the band lost the sense of harmony they had on their far better albums (see above)- wild drums and tortured singing are not a good equivalent (if at all) to the magic of their other works. After Angel Dust (my favorite FNM cd) this poor concoction was a disappointing failure."
4,Had about 4 cool songs,"I liked some of songs on this album. I was bummed in '95 when it came out after Angel Dust, because it doesn't even compare. I only hope & pray they regroup with Martin and create an ""Angel Dust II.""Just A Man & Take This Bottle made my hair curl... I hated how Patton got his fingers into so much of the songs, alot of them are lame and pretentious, like he just wants to show off his voice instead of really channeling his vocal abilities into a really good song like he did on all of them on Angel Dust. I really don't know why his fans worship this guy's spit.Every song on Angel Dust is awesome. Maybe 4 songs are halfway decent on this album like Ricochet, Evidence, King For A Day & Ugly In The Morning. Get anything from Angel Dust and before if you want to hear their best stuff."
4,Still Faith,"Faith No More cut their hair shorted and they music style was changed. If it was metal before, now it is rock. This album starts with great song ""Get Out"" and ""Ricochet"" which are both great power rock tracks. ""The Gentle Art..."", ""Digging the Grave"", ""Ugly in the Morning"", ""Cuckoo for Caca"", ""What a Day"" show that Faith No More can rock quite rudely. The classic ballads ""Evidence"", ""King for a Day"", and ""Just a Man"" make this a great album. Some songs like ""Star A.D."" and quite boring ballad ""Caralho Voador"", and ""Take This Bottle"" make this album less good...but this is still great.Stars: Digging the Grave, The Gentle Art of Making Enemies, Just a Man"
5,Schizo and Diverse - Another FNM Classic,"King for a Day is their most diverse and my favorite FNM album. Mike Patton is in top form with his wackyness and his vocal range. They venture from death metal, jazz, swing, latin, country, R&B, grunge, funk, basically just about any genre you can think of. Maybe this album is not quite as consistent as Angel Dust, but it is even more diverse, more wacky, and make more radical departures. The best cut here and perhaps their best song ever Evidence combines Smooth jazz, R&B, and funk. Evidence is simply one of the best songs I have ever heard. I absolutely love the death metal screaming. I can always get a good laugh every time, even if I am down. King for a Day is simply too creative for its own good. If you want creative and adventurous music you don't need to look any further. King for a Day is pure bliss!"
3,"Messy, but good","Not their strongest work, it's kind of all over the place, but there's some really good stuff in here, if you weed through the slop. One good thing about this record is that, more than any other, it captures the feel of the FNM live show. It's noisey, messy, and fun. The best moments on this album come when they seem to settle down and not try to cram too much into things, like openner ""Get Out"" and the almost ""too good for this album"" '70s style funk-ballad ""Evidence."" Another great one is ""King For a Day,"" which goes from mellow, acoustic sing-along to loud, schrapnel & screaming noisiness, back to an eerie, overlong outro with Patton whispering his death speech. On another good note, this one was the first record with the ""new"" Faith No More, after getting rid of guitarist Jim Martin, and all things considered, this album really wouldn't have worked with Martin's style."
4,One of the greatest albums of the 90's...PERIOD!!,"You know when you listen to an album and you are completely blown away? You try to find one flawed song but you can't? Well, this is one of those albums. It was very under-rated and so was this band. They are still one of my favorite bands, and i still listen to this album all the time."
