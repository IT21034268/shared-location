2,Barely worth the effort of reading it,"I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were completely unbelievable. The heroine, Cathy, is working herself to death to support her mother and help her twin siblings through medical school, but she doesn't have so much as a phone conversation with them. She also seemed incredibly naive in some ways, I kept on thinking, ""Hasn't this woman ever watched Oprah?"" Perhaps this can be explained by the fact that it's a rewrite of a novel originally published some years ago.The hero, believes all women are like his ex-wife, only out for his money. He didn't have any other influences, a mother? a teacher? anyone?It seemed like it had the potential to be a much better book than it was."
2,Disappointed,"Back of the book makes the novel sound better than it is. I recommend ""Where the Heart Is"" instead of this over-dramatized book."
3,I was a little disappointed in the book,"I read the reviews and thought that it sounded like a good book but when I read it, it just wasn't as good as her other books. It's an okay book but I wouldn't recommend to anyone expecting a 5 star story!"
3,An okay book but not up to Ms. Lowell's usual standards,I read the reviews and decided to take a chance and read this book because I am a big fan of Elizabeth Lowell. I have to admit I was a little disappointed because it did not seem up to the author's usual standards. The characters lacked depth and the plot was not very interesting.
3,Dull love story with heartwrenching ending,"Cat Cochran is a hard working photographer. She has to be in order to support her mother and siblings. She has no time for herself oftens neglects her health. Whilst photographing the ocean, Cat meets the handsome and debonair Travis Danvers. Little does she know that Travis or rather his famous sailing boat is her next photgraphic assignment. They spend a great few days together but Travis wants her to drop everything so that she can go sailing off into the sunset with him. Being the sensible girl that she is, Cat cannot drop her work for him.Basically, the story is about Cat and Travis falling in love and trying to learn to trust each other. Both have been badly let down in previous relationships and both are distrustful of the opposite sex. Other than that not much happens. Which is why I found the story rather dull. Altough there is a heartwrenching twist towards the end of the book which saves the book from being a complete flop.Lea Ling Tsang"
2,A reader and a fan,"This is the old trashy Elizabeth Lowell -- over 20 years old. I have read all her books and she keeps getting better. This is pocket romantic trash. What little that passes for plot is based on misunderstanding, miscommunication, characters who immediately in the absence of facts (or in the face of facts to the contrary) assume the worst possible motives, based on some past traumatic romantic experience. For the rest of the book they stubbornly hang on to their wrongheaded beliefs to their misery and to the boredom and annoyance of the reader. 10% plot; 90% filler made of long descriptions of sexual feelings and acts, the obligatory coursing through veins and splaying of hands, coupled with lots of angry and stupid comments, all leading up to the inevitable reconciliation. Please authors and PUBLISHERS, stop dredging up old inferior stuff and recyling it to disappointed fans"
4,Good choice for grieving friend,The basket was a good choice and much appreciated by my friend and her family. The only complaint was that it took longer than expected to arrive.
1,"awful, a disgrace","Having read ""As it Began,"" the definitive history of the Awesome group Queen, this movie was scarce of facts and some facts were incorrect. And the main narrator sounded like he didn't even know what he was talking about it!!! Please do not watch this movie if you have any interest inQueen! I am so upset I have it and will be throwing it in the garbage. There is so much better Queen to watch, watch Wembley, On Fire, and especially disc 2 of the Tribute to Freddie concert. The new dvd of the Queen interviews was also great (got it on Amazon.)Thank You, If I could give it less than zero stars I would.From a dedicated Queen Fan."
4,Great Learning too!,"If you want to learn more in depth about music, while keeping it real practical by applying it to songs and current material."
2,Buy only if you don't mind being preached to,"The DVD itself is OK, covering the basic 5 positions of the pentatonic scale. It is really geared more toward beginners than intermediate or advanced guitarists due to the slow pace of over half the video. The sections on practicing, technique & application were good, but short. I would've like to have seen these sections expanded a bit.My problem is with the instructor, who forwarded me an email entitled ""Was Christmas once a pagan holiday?"" and then proceeded to preach about Christianity. When I complained, I was quoted some Bible verses and basically told ""If you don't like it, too bad"". No thanks. This same information can be found elsewhere without the religious proselytizing of the instructor."
4,Pentatonic Scale,The video does a good job of explaining the pentatonic scale in differentpositions and different keys. I was looking for a video with more ideas on soloing.
4,Deftly merges theory with application,"I have a shelf full of instruction books and instructional DVDs. Of those I am finding Desi Serna's Getting Started with Pentatonic Scales DVD invaluable for two simple reasons - the concepts behind pentatonic scales and how to learn/practice them are clearly articulated and - most importantly - it demonstrates in a compelling way how one can use this knowledge. Mr Serna provides this through extensive reference lists of popular songs using pentatonic scales and with instructional video showing how to get started determining a song's key and whether it is in major or minor. In addition the purchase also includes follow on material - mp3 clips, tab and video - provided by email.Before starting to work with Getting Started with Pentatonic Scales I was an ok guitarist who knew a few songs. This DVD is proving invaluable to me next step which is to solo and to start making my own music."
4,All You Need To Get Started,This is a really good video for starting and intermediate guitarists. Fairly detailed and straight forward description on the Pentatonic as well as lots of fun new ideas on improvisation.Good buy.
2,Not very good,I love bratz but this game was not very fun I played it once then sold it at a garage sale for [$]. Its not worth your money.
2,Dissapointing!,"I bought this game. I started Playing with it then after a few days, some of the pieces got lost. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for something else. This toy is JUNK. DON NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
2,Not Worth Your Money!,I bought this for my 10 year old daughter. When she played with it with her friends. Some pieces got lost. My daughter was so dissapointed. I was dissapionted because I wastd my money on this junk.NOTE: DO NOT WASTE YOUR VERY HARD EARNED MONEY OVER THIS PRICED ITEM!
3,A Bratz Adventure,"This game is actually pretty fun, and i'm 12! It's about the girls getting ready to go out. It's almost like memory, only better. I recomend thus game for kids 6-12."
3,"Fun, but don't lose any parts","My daughter received this game recently on her 9th birthday and really enjoyed playing it with her friends. I even played a few times and found it entertaining. The only thing is if you lose any of the stars with the body parts and clothes, the game is ruined."
1,Don't buy it,"Lousy game play, cheap product and very superficial values are communicated through the game."
3,"Some good tracks, some unintentional filler?","While I'm sure the artists here were happy to record a tribute to Yaz, I'm not sure the producers were exacting enough. There are great rendentions of Yaz songs by Ganymede, Empire State Human, Electrosquad, and others, but the multiple versions of ""Winter Kills"" are sad, sad affairs. Where is the beauty and drama of the original? (Okay, the original was a just a little over the top but not by much). The fresh-sounding versions of ""Bad Connection"" (Empire State Human), ""Nobody's Diary"" (Cosmicity), and ""Only You"" (Electrosquad) almost make it worth the price. But as much as I like Yaz, do we REALLY need a cover of ""I Before E Except After C""? If you don't own ""Upstairs at Eric's"", then go out and buy it before you plunk down money for this CD."
3,"Not bad, not great.","Few tribute albums live up to the origional artist's songs they do cover versions of... this album is no exception. None of the artists can match Alison Moyets deep and soulful voice. On the other hand the covers of ""Situation"" and ""Don't Go"" are very good. Over all this album is hit or miss."
4,A much appreciated gift,"I sent this to a sick friend and she really appreciated it(not that she would've told me if she hated it). It's thoughtful, as any gift basket is, but also cute, and perfect for the get-well scenario. Hey, if you're going to be sick, you might as well get presents, right?"
1,I wouldn't send this to someone who is sick,"the image of this gift is cutesy with the cardboard box that looks like a medical bag, however the reality of the majority of the contents should not be sent to anyone who is sick, after surgery or for get well. Forget sweets, salts and misc cutesy packaging that will just be thrown away. Send some nice organic bamboo socks, beverage container so they can stay hydrated, an organic lip balm or lotion for dry lips and skin. You can get all the items before mentioned at the same cost or less including delivered at CareGifting."
5,Perfect gift,What a perfect gift! I ordered this for my roommate who was very ill while I was away and she loved it! So much better then flowers! I would definitely order this again.
1,Did not live up to the hype,I was very disapointed in this book. I got more out of the Primavera SureTrak 3.0 book that came with the software than I did from this book. Not worth the money.
1,"Not a long-term solution, should be better for the price","I've owned three of these timers, each installed in different locations and environments, none of them ""harsh."" All three of these timers has died the same way within 12 months of install: the internal power supply fails, leaving the timer to run on the single AA backup battery only, which quickly drains. The result is a useless timer, unless you like installing a new battery and completely reprogramming the timer every 3-5 days. I thought this timer would solve the problem of having to reset a mechanical timer after every power failure, but the cure is worse than the disease, and I'm going back to mechanical. This item doesn't last and is costly to replace."
1,Old Earth Creationism,"Classic old Earth Creationism argument. Good discussion of the age of universe. However, the logic breaks down once Gange goes outside his area of expertise; the ecology of earth and how it has changed over time. He offers a simplistic variation on complexity and design in that Earth's ecosystems are too complex to have arisen by random processes. No mention of changes that have occurred over billion of years and variations in environments and climate. No mention of climatic changes, plate tectonics, or extinctions. Good example of a well educated individual attempting to go beyond their level of expertise."
3,Not the best toy out there,"I'm a big fan of the Ocean Wonders line of baby products, but these stacking pails aren't a huge hit in my house. I bought them at the consignment store and am glad I didn't pay full price for them. My daughter did, briefly, enjoy loading other toys into the largest of the three buckets...but she quickly realized that her empty margarine containers could hold more toys.This is a toy she abandoned pretty quickly. It is cute to look at, but not a toy I would register for and not a toy I will buy as a gift for anyone."
1,Boring!!!!,"We have the crib aquarium toy and my 9 mos old loves it. So I thought he would love this one too. Well, he has never played with it and it doesn't do much. The bucket is heavy and it doesn't make any sounds. It doesn't keep my baby's interest."
2,TOO HEAVY,"This toy is really heavy for a little person to carry around. Yhea..it is pretty with all the colors, but there are so many other great toys to pick from that are also pretty to look at."
2,Heavy Bore,"My son doesn't like to play with this toy much. It's very heavy and it doesn't seem to interest him. While the fishbowl is still heavy, it's a much more fun toy for him. If you had to choose one, skip the pails and go for the fishbowl."
4,"Cute, but wish it had more...","I received this toy as a shower gift. My daughter enjoyed the ball and stacking the buckets, but she kept fiddling with the little attachments on the bucket, thinking something would happen. This toy would've gotten a higher rating from me if it had.All in all a cute toy. The larger bucket is heavy, but that wouldn't discourage me from buying it."
2,I agree...this is a heavy toy!,"Our daughter didn't enjoy this toy quite as much as we had hoped. She mostly played with the ball, and whenever she would carry the large HEAVY bucket, I would stress that she'd drop it on her foot (due to this, it's probably better to play with this toy in the tub only)."
2,Boring Toy,My 8 month old is bored by this toy. The cups are very small and the ball rests on top. No ideal for an infant.
3,"Cute, But Too Heavy!","I loved the look of this toy when I first saw it. When I gave it to my 9-month-old baby, however, he didn't do much with it. He kept trying to grab the fish out of the bottom of the bucket, which was frustrating. Also the larget bucket is just too heavy. The water and glitter are a nice touch, but make the product too difficult to lift for a small child without assistance."
2,Lots better choices out there to learn about stacking,"I have these as well as some cheap plastic stacking cups and my 1 year old has never used these much. The cheap multi-colored cups that come 6-10 per set for about $2-$3 are much lighter, teach the stacking skills and take up way less space. I'd say my daughter uses those about 30-45 minuts a day and NEVER uses this toy. Buy the cheap cups instead. This toy is soooo heavy I don't understand why it is suitable for little kids. I am very disappointed overall with this toy."
2,Not a bath toy!,"While this is a fun toy for little ones, I wouldn't use it in the bath. There is a screw on the bottom of the largest pail that rusted the first time we used it, which doesn't make it suitable for water in my opinion!It is also VERY heavy, my daughter has never had trouble with the weight but it's far too fun for them to throw at innocent bystanders like the kitty, daddy giving them a bath, or your glass door. This toy could do some serious damage."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my twin girls when they were about 9 mo. old. They were not very intreasted in it at the time so I figured that if I put it up and brought it out periodically they would like it one day. They never did, they are now 16 mo. old and still don't play with it. They do like the ball, but that is about it. I am very dissapointed in this toy for a few reasons:1.)it is very heavy for nesting pails (they have dropped it on their feet many times).2.)it is not a bath toy as it came up under for the search3.)my girls still do not have the strength to turn the crab inside one of the pails.Overall, it is a pretty boring toy. Luckily it wasn't too expensive. (I got them the fish bowl from FP at 3 mo. old that matched the set thinking that they would like this as much. Boy was I wrong). The cheap Sassy cups are a much better choice!"
3,Ok-but there are better options out there,"I got this toy for my son when he was 8 months old. I thought the bucket was really heavy for a little one to pick up. Also he became really frustrated because he couldn't pick up the little animals screwed into the bottom of the pails. It is fun for the stacking purposes, but I would choose a set of nesting cups or blocks which have the same educational value at a better price and also have more items to stack."
3,only two of the buckets holds any interest,"the one with the starfish and the one with the hermit crab are the only ones that my baby enjoys playing with. the others are either boring or too heavy. the ball also does not fit very well in the top bucket, so it got lost very quickly"
5,Great Toy,"My husband had bought this toy for our son. What a great choice.My son just loves it. This toy keeps him busy for at least 30 minutes. The stacking of the little buckets is great, the movement of the stars are wonderful with the movement of the water. The colors are so vibrant and it keeps my son very amused. Once, again a great toy."
3,listed incorrectly,"I guess I wasn't paying attention. This was listed as a bath toy, and while I guess it can go in the water it is NOT a bath toy which is what I was looking for. My little boy pays very little attention to it. Wish I'd read the description better."
2,Pointless Toy,"I purchased this toy for my 7 month old and discovered after openning the package that although the toy is colorful- there is no purpose or learning activity associated with it. It Doesn't make noise, doesn't light up and it's not much fun to play with. Spend your money on someting else!"
2,"Cute, but not fun","I bought this for my son because he loved his little aquarium that was in his crib. However, he liked this toy for all of 5 minutes. After his first time playing with it, he never showed interest again. The pail was very heavy. The only thing he liked was the little ball HOWEVER he liked to throw it (bad news, since the ball was made out of hard, heavy plastic).I thought it was really cute which is why I bought it but in the long run it was a waste of money."
5,One of my sons favorite toys....,"I got this & the ocean wonders fishbowl for my son & he plays with them the longest out of any of his other toys. He loves to hear the buckets clank around when he fits them inside one another, and there is one with beads that he likes to shake and hear rattle. The flutter ball it comes with is cute, and if you buy the fishbowl too they go together nicely. They are both relatively inexpensive, and are both good at teaching eye hand coordination, particularly the pails. A great buy!!! I just wish that they weren't as heavy as they are so I could take them with us on outings."
2,No Fun,My daughter loved the fishbowl but was not interested in this toy at all. She got it as a gift and never really played with it. I think it is a little boring and there are other great stacking toys out there.
1,what baby can lift this?,"I love the fisherprice fish bowl. I thought this would be as enjoyable. The buckets looks pretty, but are very heavy. A child could hurt themselves if they were to have it drop on their foot. I would not purchase this."
2,I have a black eye because ot this toy!,"We bought it for our son when he was 8 months old. We were going to buy the fisherprice fish bowl, but I saw it in a store and thought it was way too heavy for a baby. Well, this one is too heavy too! The pails are beautiful and catch my son's attention for a while, but when he started to stand up and cruise, he would fall often (as any baby does) and more than twice he fell and hit his head on the bigger bucket, getting hurt (he was in his playpen). Now he's 1 year old and he likes to throw things at us. Yesterday he threw the smallest bucket at my face and it hit so hard that now I have a black eye! Imagine what could have happened if my son was playing with another baby and threw it at him/her? This toy should be recalled, it's way too hard and too heavy for a kid this age and only causes bruises."
5,Great Compilation,This is a great compilation for those getting started with Belly Dance. I also like that the packaging is made of recyclable card and that a portion of the proceeds go to Oxfam who works towards ending poverty around the world....
1,Looking for something different,"I was cautiously hopeful for more originality in this release, and disappointed to find very little. I listened to this once and haven't seen the disc since. I appreciated the attempt at writing more songs that involve everyone, not just me and my experience. But beyond that, the CD left me wanting something fresh musically and lyrically, some different integrated musical styles and in general, a sense of diversity."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to buy it when it first came out. I really like experimental heartfelt worship, but everything felt so bland and barely seeming inspired. DCB seemed to be a slight exception. Again, normally I really like this stuff. Instead, try the new Hillsong United CD..."
5,Una pequeña joya,"He encontrado el libro muy útil , entretenido , y facil de leer.Muy recomendable para iniciarse en el cálculo mental."
1,Too many words make for a tedious read.,"When seperated from all the chaff, Emerick's ideas are intriguing. The problem with this book is the chaff. On his way to (eventually) conveying his message, Emerick manages to bore and irritate the reader with page after page of empty and useless elaboration of a point that he has already made. I found myself saying ""enough already!"" as I skimmed in search of the next bit of substance. Ironic for a book about communication, eh?"
1,Promises and padding. Not much delivered.,"The book promises practical steps in NLP to improve aspects of ones life. These are not forthcoming. There is a lot of padding and redundancy which becomes tedious after the first chapter. I started making notes. Then I got to scoring out passages. Then pages. In the end I was so annoyed I tore out irrelevant pages in chunks. Out of the first 150 pages, there was only about a page and a half I thought worth keeping. Simple ideas are cloaked in obscure terminology which reminds me of those boring management seminars in hot rooms where everybody falls asleep in the afternoon. Which is a shame because I am sure NLP has something to offer.This is not a 'how to' manual although it claims to be."
3,Reading Level,"This isn't a review as such, but just a correction of the reading level information. This book (and all the Biggles books) are clearly not even remotely ""baby/preschool"". It's obviously intended for children, but most plausibly 7 - 12 year olds."
4,Biggles Defies The Swastika: My Review,"A Biggles in World War 2 story, which is, in my opinion the best part of the series. Of those books, this is probably one of the best. I don't think it's THE best, but it is still pretty good. It is fast-moving and action-packed. There are only 2 real downfalls. One, the lack of actual dogfights, with most of the action being on the ground (I think there is only one dogfight and it isn't that big). As Biggles is a pilot, you'd think there'd be more, he could just as easily have been soldier or sailor here. But it doesn't matter that much, the ground action is still brilliant, and I suppose it's a change. The other problem is that there are too many characters, especially German ones (I think there are about half a dozen people called Von_______), and it's hard to remember when they reappear 6 chapters later.All up, though, it is still a good book, especially for Biggles fans like me."
1,Nothing but breeder crap!,"Well I thought this book would tell me about the history and facts about rabbit breeds of the world like the characteristics, behavior and possible health risks a breed could have, also weather it's gentle, large or prone to problems (like for example a well writtien cat or dog breed book would tell). But all this book here talks about it mainly the breeders who developed the breeds, messed with the breeds, mutated the breeds and then at the certain point perfected and brought up a breed. VERY disappointing!!! The history fact includes also some rabbit recipes...and I dont want to say more about that subject but in my opinion this book is nothing for real rabbit lovers who own a pet rabbit as dear companion since the book is mainly for people interested in treating and breeding those beautiful and lovable pets and nothing but disposable STOCK!"
5,Contemporary Gospel at Its Best!,"This CD is a wonderful blessing to those who listen. It's so good I am actually speechless. Frank Morrison-Henderson has been blessed with a great gift to sing, compassion for people and an amazing song-writing ability. This man's voice is so incredible you would have to be Satan not to be moved by both him and the music.This is one of the few CDs where you sit there and listen to every single track and be blessed by every word. I have listened to this CD over and over and I can't get enough of it. Listening to this CD has encouraged my soul and spirit.I highly recommend it to everyone who LOVES contemporary gospel."
5,Great Game!!,"I've actually been playing this game for many years. It's far superior to WoW. I will warn you if you are young or have attention defecit disorder...you will not like this game. This game does require some attention, so many younger folks who try it quit. It also means that most who play are a mature lot."
2,"Beautiful, but not impressive in performance","Recently, I bought B&O; computer speaker, and realized need to buy a subwoofer. I wanted to buy not too big and not too expensive, but beatiful. Tivoli subwoofer seemed to satisfy all my options. However, in performance, little disappointed. The woofer makes some tearing sound if you listen music louder (not crazy louder - just plentful to your room).Also, it automatically shut down, when the signal is missing, which means most of classic music is not supported (only pop music, but tearing sound).If you want to buy this only for the design, just go for it.Unless, buy different one."
3,a readable account of a great topic without a big take-away,"Willman's writing is generally good, but can be a bit over the top. There are some great stories here (particularly about Steve Earle and Toby Keith), but I'm still not sure what the big take-away is."
2,Superficial,"Maybe I expected too much. When I first saw the title I jumped to conclusion that the book would be about the ""politics"" of the country music business, how deals really get made, etc. However, focus on the main title and think red states and blue states. It could still have been an interesting book, taking an in depth look at the relationship between the country music business and the political business. Rather, for the most part author Chris Willman, who writes for an entertainment magazine, treats us to his encyclopedic knowledge of song lyrics which directly or indirectly reflect political themes. For the country music enthusiast alone, the fan magazine flavor might have a lot of appeal. But if you've also got a serious interest in politics, forget it."
4,Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music,A well documented book.Your content is very interesting with abundant explanations about the relationship between politics and the stars of country music.Regards
3,May be helpful if you direct weddings for your church,"I purchased this book because we were conducting the wedding ceremony ourselves, without the help of a consultant or wedding director. Although this little book does offer brief advice on many aspects of planning a wedding, it focuses mostly on the arrangements of bridal party and the formal church wedding ceremony. Any bride who has purchased a wedding planning book will have all this information, and in more detail. In the Author's Note's, she describes one purpose of the book as ""[to] give a wedding committee member a method on how to direct"". That might be the most useful purpose for this book."
2,Helpful if you've never directed a wedding,"This book is geared more for the director of traditional Christian church weddings. If you are church wedding director and unfamiliar with directing a wedding, then this is a great book for you. However, if you are a bride who wants to a unique, personalized, non-cookie cutter wedding, then pass this one by. We live in the 21st century, and these days there are so many options to planning a beautiful wedding. The author holds fast to several outdated traditions and uses too many ""shoulds"". Also, what about the groom? It's HIS wedding, not the mother of the bride's. There are several wedding planning books available that will help you in planning a lovely, elegant ceremony."
3,Common sensical book,This is a very small book that has a few useful tid bits but there are many other more useful resources out there. Mostly it includes information on the different formations you can choose for the ceremony (who can stand where or with whom). I suggest just buying a large planner and it will include the information included in this book.
2,muddled and meandering,"After the joyful exuberance of His Majesty's Dragon, this sequel was disappointingly full of preachy political arguments that quickly turned into an interminable bore. In addition, it was sad to watch Laurence and Temeraire's relationship sour. Lastly, don't think the final book in the trilogy will tie everything up or resolve anything -- it's just a series of depressing and weary battles that go on and on and on. If the first book hadn't left me so invested in what happens to Temeraire, I would have give both this second book as well as the third one a single star."
1,Not up to par,"I loved the first novel in the series, ""His Majesty's Dragon"". I highly recommend that first book!However, you may as well stop there. The first book is satisfying and complete on its own, WITHOUT the rest of the series.I personally found this sequel to be boring and meandering.That said, I do think fans of historical Chinese travelogue fiction would actually truly enjoy this particular installment."
5,Just lovely,"This book really makes you wanna have a dragon for a best friend!the adventures only get better, again I recommend you get all the books at once you will like them all"
2,huh?,"I have several things to say about this book, which I did enjoy reading, with some caveats:First, and most of all, where is the plot? You won't find much 'rising and falling' action here, although there are a couple of rapidfire [excuse the pun] intense moments.Second, how am I supposed to know what a ""pry bar"" is and whether it's being used to save Laurence or to murder him?And finally, the ending, which was more of a two-page cop out than really addressing the major issues at stake, with the preceding 200 pages seemingly swaying the reader toward the opposite conclusion. I'm so unconvinced."
3,Not as good as the first.,"I am through two books of the series and I am conflicted. I mentioned after His Majesty's Dragon that I love Naomi Novik's dragons. While that still holds true, I now wonder how much, if at all, I truly love the rest of the story.Throne of Jade is over 400 pages long and I felt like very little happened for the first (roughly) 300 pages. Once it was time for the few important events to take place, they happened so abruptly I wondered if they were as important to the story as they seemed that they should be.Ms. Novik brought dragons into our world in the first book and here she broadened our horizons with a look at dragons from the far ends of the Earth. I will continue to read the series, at least for now. But I am beginning to wonder if it is the idea that I love and not its execution. It may become difficult to get through what is now already a five-book series if I cannot get excited about what happens on dragonless pages."
2,A very disappointing sequel to an excellent first book,"I truly enjoyed ""His Majesty's Dragon"", the first book of the series. I eagery started the second book, and ended up forcing myself to have to finish the book. I will agree with most observations that the development of Tereraire is very good in this book. Unfortunately, it seems that the author forgot about the main human character in the book, Laurence. The problem is, is that Laurence started out as a Captain of a Royal Navy Ship, and served for more than three years, yet for all of that, his character appeared to be as green as a raw recruit in everything in this book except the single fight scene. I felt that he was immature and had almost no common sense in this book, which is completely at odds with his character in the first book. True, this is more of a diplomatic area than wartime, and I could forgive a little uncertainty on his part, yet it just seemed like less thought was put into his character development than in Temeraire's."
2,A steep decline ...,"I really enjoyed the first book in this series, but feel like this second book goes far, far astray. The first book sets up a wonderful world in which dragons fight in the air during the naval battles of the Napolionic (sp?) war. This book throws it all away to get onto a literal slow boat to China. I bought the third book at the same time, I hope the series picks back up."
3,More relationship development please!,"The first book was interesting because I loved the development of the dragon/rider relationship. The second book took the relationship for granted, and we see more of Teremaire's personality coming out. I missed the interpersonal relationships though, and the supporting characters needed more development. Still entertaining and I am looking forward to the 3rd book in the series."
3,As exciting as a LONG sea voyage,"I agree with other reviewers who have commented that this was a disappointment after the first book. I felt like I was on a long sea voyage with nothing to read but Robert Jordan. When the characters finally reached the orient, the plot was obtuse and unsatisfying. I continue to like the characters, but I would like to see the setting return to the hook that made the first book in the series appealing - a book about dragons in the Napoleonic Wars, set in Europe (i.e., ""Hornblower with dragons""). If ""Throne of Jade"" had been the first in the series, I doubt many would have read the second. It was however, just good enough to convince me to move on to the (already published) third in the series, with the hope that it is more than a long journey overland to the middle east with detailed description of dragon cuisine."
3,"Throne of Jade - not as good as #1, but still fun","Throne of Jade continues the story of Captain Will Laurence, the navy captain who becomes an aviator in the English dragon corps and forges a lifelong bond with the dragon Temeraire. In the second installment, the Chinese demand the return of their stolen dragon, and Will and Temeraire set off on a voyage to the Far East, facing storms, French attacks, and constant attempts by the Chinese to drive them apart. The second book is considerably less fast paced than the first one, but still entertaining and intriguing - especially when they reach China and discover a dragon culture distinctly different from what they've come to know in the West."
4,On a Slow Boat to China,"I love this series, these dragons, Cap'n. Laurence, and add all that to the Orient, and I'm headed for bliss... except, I hardly got there. I realize, middle book and all, but this pacing was too slow. And too bad for the readers, since once the whole entourage does arrive in China, it's all as fascinating as we'd hoped! The Chinese dragon characters were wonderful, and all I wanted was more! Of course, it really doesn't matter, I'm totally hooked on this series now, and expect that Black Powder War will pick the pace back up. As I write this, I realize I feel rather guilty for chiding Novik for the slack -- really it just amounts to what a high standard she has set for herself from the first book! Bottom line from me, read them all, highly recommended!"
3,Is Ok,"Book is ok but author follows the same pattern where she sticks on one part of the story, drawing it out and then at the end rushes through it"
3,keesp the story going.,this second installment isnt going to knock your socks off but it gives a little backstory for fans of the series.
5,Great Product,This product was everything it stated and worked great. Shipped right away. I would purchase it again and recommend it to others.
3,it is Ok,"it is ok ,i eat a teaspoon before i go out for running , and i think there is some difference after i use it ,but not as much as i thought."
2,Leaking package,"Disappointing leaking package , almost 15% of it is gone , i read the similar leakage story from another person.Consider it before shopping"
3,l-carnitine,I am unsure how well it is working. It was recommended by my doctor and follow-up testing and evaluation have not been completed.
4,Great for Celiac,This product keeps our daughter from having any adverse side effects from eating certain foods that would normally cause her severe abdominal pain. It has been a life saver. The only issues we have ever had are with leaking bottles when the shipment arrives. Different bottling may be in order.
2,Super Sweet!!!!,OMG! This is sooooo sweet! I would find it easier to swallow a spoon of sugar. I have a sweet tooth and still I cannot drink this. I tried mixing the tablespoon in a 16oz. bottle of water and it's still sweet. I am going to have to go back to the capsules.
1,Leaking bottle.,"The bottle was I received was leaking (only less than 2/3 full by the time it arrived) probably due to improper sealing or packaging. Honestly, I want to order another bottle but I'm afraid I might get another one that's improperly sealed."
3,Love the product. Not happy with how it arrived.,"I read the reviews and was familiar with the product as I had used the 1000 mg before, which was bought at a store, so I was prepared for some leakage but was hoping for the best. This product just needs to be shipped better to avoid leakage. It was minor but because of that I will probably not purchase again."
2,doesn't seem to work,i used liquid carnitine in Germany every time i wanted to lose some weight. worked perfectly. this product doesn't do the trick. i usually get catastrophic diarrhoea when i swig too liberately on l-carnitine. not so with this. not at all actually. my stool was hard as a rock this morning...
4,L-Carnitine,I felt like I had more energy and this product was a very good price. It did however have some sort of leaking when I received the package.
4,don't over dose,"I use post workout to help fat loss. Increased dosages cause diarrhea. I usually see some weakness when taken preworkout , so I avoid around workout times. Supposedly there is a recovery enhancement when taken post workout, so I take then"
3,All but the top surface,Dogs seem to love this bed and often play head games over its use. The only complaint is that the soft material on top is starting to get very thin with use. Hopefully I can just replace this w/out having to purchase the rest.
2,No photos,"This cookbook is one of those books that whatever you have left over in the fridge, you can dump it into a casserole. I'm not impressed!"
4,Great cookbook,This cookbook is a must if you like casseroles. Great homestyle recipes-- no matter what you are craving you will find it here. There are so many delicious choices it's often hard to decide.
2,"Ok, I guess","Book is ok, but I prefer more in depth accounts of the lives & experiences of those published in it."
3,Nice lock,"It works ok...could be thicker material. LUFKIN - MADE IN CHINA. Other than that, its a fine tape. Will search for made in the USA."
1,PART NUMBER IS WRONG,The online chart that tells you if this fits your car is quite wrong..it took a good 40 days to arrive and the belt was way too small . I even double checked after it finally arrived and the part number is wrong and the online chart is wrong.
2,no thanks,would only suggest it if you are actually going to israel and need to know how to get to around
3,Decent blade at a low price,"The S&W; Extreme Ops blades are relatively low grade but as a 3rd or 4th back up option they are more than adequate. The blade is 440C which is a low/midgrade blade steel. The handle is aluminum with a black matte paint job. Overall it's a pretty heavy knife, not ideal for a EDC. It does have a post structure to prevent it from collecting gunk and making cleaning easy.A kit can be bought for this knife to make it an assisted open. Read your state laws for applicable restrictions."
3,good lightweight stroller,"i agree with the others that there is a lot of room for improvement. i purchased this stroller for my toddler that is two years old because i wanted a light weight stroller to use when i have to run quick errands and for my husband to use when he is with my son, he doesn't have a lot of room in his trunk so this is perfect for him. it pushes very smoothly and works well in sand at the beach. the only problem i have with this is that it is very lightweight that if you put even the slightest weight it will fall backwards, maybe if the wheels were a little bit bigger like the vigour it wouldn't fall backwards. the small basket underneath is good enough to hold a few diapers and wipes and snacks, maybe a change of clothes for the few hours that you are gone."
1,poor quality,"This particular album is one of my favorites by New Birth. However, the quality and sound of this cd is very poor."
3,No Birth here!,"This version sucks! The sound quality sounds like it's been recorded from the original wax, not the master tapes. Sequence is out of order and the origianl name of the album is called ""Love Potion"" and the cover art has all of the members nude on the orignal album cover. However, one of the New Birth's best recordings!"
3,Healthy Heart Handbook,"This book provided a general background about the heart, cholesterol and high blood pressure. I found the book did not provide me with any information that is already available for free from the Americn Heart Association. Several heart-wise recipes were included. The most helpful thing I noted was to eat an apple a day...."
1,Lots of errors,"There are a lot of errors in this dictionary. Many of them are taken from the older missionary dictionaries. And the spelling is hard to read. If you are serious about learning Lakota, the only truly reliable dictionary is theNew Lakota Dictionary."
3,"good, but...","This is a good book, but I find it to be at odds with many other sources of Lakota linguistics. Many traditional terms and spellings are simply missing, and I think that my ancestors would not be generally impressed. I received it as a gift, and appreciate the work that went into it, but their are other more comprehensive choices."
1,Bad purchase from AMAZON,"The bottle was only half full.Furthermore, the bottle seemed to have been used before.I should be compensated for the purchase of this product.I hope AMAZON will take notice and act on it."
5,I had had it and this book fixed it!,"I had finally reached the end of my rope. Everything in my life seemed difficult, my relationships, my career. I kept wishing that something would just come easy.David's book helped me realize that the spiritual foundation that I had formed during my upbringing did not provide the support that I required to get through tough times. I continued to look externally for strength and direction when all the time I had the power within myself.Since reading this book I have started taking charge of my life and everything seems new, exciting and possible. I can't recommend this book enough. It speaks to everyone! Read it! Share it! Live it!"
5,Wonderful. A great read. Loved it!,"I really enjoyed this book. It's deep, funny, and thought provoking all at the same time. I also think it offers hope and healing -- helping people find their own inner peace. It's wonderfully refreshing and reassuring to read a new voice out there who isn't just saying the same old things. My folks saw it on my coffee table one night, so they borrowed it. They ended up getting their own copy because they said its message ""rang true"" in their hearts. Now my dad can't stop reading his favorite parts over and over, and he's a young-at-heart 70-year old man. If you have the chance, it is definitely worth the experience to ""be"" with this special book. You'll want to share its wisdom of the ages. Renew, recharge, and rejuvenate yourself with this treat for the spirit written by an old soul who happens to appear young."
2,A World Tour of Wisdom:,"found me at the right time. What David says just makes sense. We do have to ""get over ourselves"" in order to grow. This book is more than a collection of quotes and clever insights. For me, it was a wake-up call, a reminder that I was just going through the motions. I keep this book close by and refer back to it simply by randomly opening it and reading what is on the page. What I find is always appropriate. I have shared this book with friends and we all agree with David that ""although the paths are many, the truth is one"". Knowing that we are all connected by this simple wisdom has definitely made a difference even in the smallest of challenges I face each day."
3,Some major gaps...,"It's great to see a concise survey of 20th century Catholic theology such as this come out - but my complaint is not that it isn't written well, but that it focuses so heavily on Vatican II and the Nouvelle Theologie movement (admittedly a dominant movement) and focuses very little on anything else.My question is - why does Fr. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange not even warrant a section of his own? Many consider him the greatest Thomist since St. Thomas Aquinas himself, and he doesn't even get his own section? And yet a liberal hack theologian like Hans Kung does? This is inexplicable. Sure, Kung's horrifically poor theology warrants a section, but at the expense of others like Garrigou=Lagrange, it makes no sense...Also, where is Jacques Maritain???"
4,Not an introductory text,"I would recommend this after a lower-level introductory text. Also, the reader should be familiar with Hilbert spaces before reading. Perhaps too much mathematical detail for the practitioner."
3,"There is theory, but not enough methods. Book for academics.","I am a graduate student at Columbia. Richard Davis was my time series professor.This book is really rigorous and well organised. Theory is present, but we cannot see enough methods and applications. Yet the title suggest that there are some methods. It is a useful book for academics, but if you want to go in the financial industry (quant, strategist or trading) do not buy this book because not much of the content is applicable.The software ISTM 2000 is really impressive: powerful and quick. I recommend this software and think it could be used on trading floors, or in a hedge fund, for speculative purposes, or arbitrage."
1,2001 NCAA lacrosse championship,"For one thing the disc's were scratched so bad I could not watch it and had to return it, second, the sleeve did not match the disc. It was advertised as the 2001 game but the disc's were the 2002 championship. I was totally disappointed and will not order any more DVDs from Amazon."
2,I don't get it,I liked reading it but didn't get the ending. Where's the ending? What happened? It was most confusing and am wondering if I now have to read his next book to understand what happened which seems weird.
3,Disappointment,"I too agree with the one star reviewers. I found the story entertaining, hence the 3 rating. I have read all of Swain's books and found them entertaining and even educational. I was so disappointed to arrive at the end of the Deadman's Poker and not have the story end. It's a pity that Swain and his publishers succumbed to tricking the public, without even a notice in the book that this was ""Part 1"" . I have the privilege in living in the part of Florida in which Swain lives and have enjoyed the locale presentation- he was even at a local bookstore signing books.Too bad he did not give consideration to his readers. I will probably buy the ""ending book"" of Deadman's Bluff just to get closure but will not continue to purchase his books. Too bad- he did have a talent."
3,Half a book,The writing is great and the build up to the end is great but there is no payoff. We have to buy the next book to figure out what is going to happen (I think). Frustrating and disappointing.
5,Herbal exctement,"I purchased the book ""JUDE'S HERBAL HOME REMEDES"" about a month ago and have used it everyday. This book is so informative and fun you just can't put it down. Full of information for everything from shampoo to animal ailment remedies. My money was well spent when I bought this book.Thank you Jude for sharing your knowledge with the rest of the world.Evelyn BarkerBoise, Idaho"
2,"A good starter, not for in-depth study","While many of ideas are practical for the ""mountain-living"" type, I doubt an apartment dweller would find much use in the recipe for lye soap. An attempt is made to keep to the tame remedies (lemon & honey, etc.), but many are ineffective and some are still plain dangerous (like taking potentially lethal megadoses of vitamins as cures). The herbal glossary is useful, as well as the scientific listing of names in the back, but I would recommend few of the recipes between."
5,"Jude's Herbal Home Remedies: Natural Health, Beauty & Home-Care Secrets","This is a wonderful book. It tells how to make salves, tinctures, ointments, liniment, syrups, and more for a wide variety of things like: herbal baths, colds, skin care, nerves, headaches, insect bites, insect repellents. It also tell what to use the recipe for."
5,a beautiful story...,A great gift for a new grandma!I have to keep reordering this book because I keep giving mine away - and I want one to share with my own grandchild!
2,"Fun game, with little annoying quirks","NBA Courtside is not as good as other hoop games. While it can be fun, it doesn't bring anything to the table that other NBA games offer (and others offer better).There are some annoying flaws to the game: no custom teams, no real defense (like many basketball vids), sometimes in the simulation game, blocked dunks are called goal-tends, the computer runs (or get pushed) out-of-bounds sometimes, or gets backcourt violations (bad AI?). Your custom players are just called by their number (e.g. ""Eight shoots a nice one!"") instead of #8 or the name written in. And, the roster is not really up-to-date. Even if you update your roster and save it, for some reason the NBA Season/Play-off mode uses a different roster set. And the commentating gets a little repetitive and annoying.Bottomline: The game has not been up-to-par with NBA Live and the NBA 2K series."
2,too old to be fun,like I said too old to be fun if your going to buy a basketball game always buy the most recent
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,"this game looked fun like many games, but when i bought it at costco and played it... only thing good that i can say about it is the graphics, but graphics don't make the game any greater. the only buttons that you really push are A,B,R,C and the joystick. try another game trust me."
3,"Slick, but not NBA 2k2","ayayay! My fellow reviewers can't seem to spell worth ****. Oh, you want to know about the game you say? Sure, it is good, and Kobe Bryant (not Coby) is on the cover, but that doesn't make up for in the least the gameplay problems and sub par graphics. My advice: save your money up and buy a playstation2 and NBA 2k2. It absolutley blows Courtside out of the water."
5,One of the best basketball games EVER!! Probably the best for the 'Cube,"I must say, after 10 years that this game STILL holds up well, especially for the GameCube. When it originally came out, I played a demo of it at Target and was amazed at the gameplay, wonderful animations and graphics of this game. This great game has awesome gameplay in simulation and arcade mode, which the latter stands out in the game, where you can choose a team and three superstars in an outdoor beach court. This game is the best in the Courtside series and would highly recommend this game for GameCube owners who are basketball fans. Also, I would recommend to those who are reminiscent of the rosters of this game - Shaq and Kobe on the Lakers, AI on the Sixers, Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce on the Celtics, J. Kidd and Kenyon Martin on NJ, Baron Davis on the Charlotte Hornets, etc."
3,My son's assessment...,"Considering it's the game from 2002, it's not TOO bad...wouldn't pay $40 for it, but my mom got it for $5 and it was well worth it..."
1,Horrible,"This is by far the worst game for GameCube that I have played. The graphics are good, but the Nintendo must have set out to make a game that by no means reflects real NBA action at all. The worst part about it the AI. There is none. The computer controlled players understand neither offense or defense. I just played a game where the Indiana Pacers missed three shots all game (43 for 45!) These kinds of statistics are impossible in a real basketball simulation. Nintendo did a great job rendering the faces of the players, but that is where the positive comments for this game will stop. Yet another atempt that falls miserably short because the designers focused too hard on graphics and not nearly hard enough on gameplay. If NBA2K2 or NBA Live are even close to being this bad, I am selling my system to buy one that can faithfully recreate sports- especially basketball."
2,TOO HARD!,"I was in the store and I was looking at the games and there was NBA Courtside 2002. My Mom was with me and she was going to get it for me because it was on sale. But I told her I would want to rent it first. I AM SO GLAD I DID! the menu is hard to under stand! the D is harder then geting a computer with nothing to read or tell you hoe to put it togethere! And the dunks look so odd. There taking steps before they get to the hoop and there not moving! NBA*Street is yhe only other NBA game I'd played for GameCube and I have.If you like fast running, high jumping, crazy dribbaling game NBA*Street is the way to go.DON""T BUY NBA COURTSIDE 2002!YOU WILL HATE IT!"
2,Gamecube Gives a bad impression,"When I purchased this game I thought it would end up being one of the best basketball sims I've ever played. Instead, it turned out being one of the most unrealistic games with fair gameplay and outrageous stats. The average player, whether it is Austin Croshere or Shaq averages around sixty points a game and twenty rebounds and fifteen assists. The league leaders average over ninety ppg. The transactions are so unrealistic and you could trade every single player on the Clippers for every single player on the Lakers, or you could create a tean of franchise players. The average score in a game is 200-190. You can steal and block balls as easy as you can say 1-2-3. Forget about this one and do yourself a favor."
1,This game is bad.,"This game has no plot or anything. It is nothing like basketball an very boring. The game is a discrace to nintendo. The graphics are not fully taken advantge with on the gamecube. My nintendo 64 could do these graphics. Another sport game on gamecube however, brings out the full potencial of the graphic processer on GCN. Don't buy this. It's the same as th one for nintendo, just a small step above. To wrap it up, this game is really bad. Don't wast your hard earned cash on this crud."
2,Basic Basketball title,"While this game may be pretty fun, other companys offer so much more and for so much less. This is the prime reason this game was overlooked. If you're looking to buy this, then go buy NBA 2k3 instead. It's waaaay better."
4,fun on a bun,"This game rules!!!you can create up to 40 players without usingextra memory!!you can make them really tall and really short.and you can make their ears,nose etc.many different sizes.it has good controls, and season mode is fun!and most of allyou can trade players from other teams and make your own dream team!!!!"
5,Best basketball game out for any system!,I love this game! This is some of the best face mapping I have ever seen in my life. It looks like you are watching a real basketball game. The gameplay is a blast with an option of 5 on 5 on a real court or 3 on 3 on a street court. This is a must buy!...
2,Ho Hum!,"I'd heard so much about this book and had read another Calvin Trillin book some years ago, so I got this one at the library hoping for a fun read. I was disappointed. This would have been an O.K. short story, but a short novel.......no! Much too repetitive; I mean how many times do we want to hear about the specific details of these New York streets? The people that come out to Tepper's car to speak with him are not believable at all. It was silly in places , but not fun.............."
1,good idea,I feel that CALVIN TRILLIN had an inspired idea for this book.One that any modern day new yorker could relate too:-the absurdity of trying to deal day to day with owning a car in the city and having any semblence of a normal life with the laws involved in parking it ---believe it or not its a true story!---But this book is hardly readable.He starts with this interesting premise---gives it dashes of humor---and then goes absolutely nowhere with it. Since i couldnt finish half way thru from utter boredom i give him 1 star for a good idea but he loses the other four for not being able to pull a good idea off.
4,A great summer-or winter- read,I found Tepper to be a very likeable character. The story was not flat but rather entertaining. Calvn Trillin has created a book that is easily a one day read. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a light but intellectual read. Great by the pool or on your lunch break!
3,A MODERN JAMES JOYCE ULYSSES FOR BLASE NEW YORKERS,"the ever deadpan Trillin does a great if incomplete job of bringing LEopold Bloom from the Liffey to the East River. Leopold Bloom is enormously generous and concerned for others. Greater love has no man than this, to lay down his wife for his friend, let own his newspaper, etc. But Tepper won't even give another driver his rare parking space. Despite the rationalization that his random grunts administer divine wisdom for hurt souls, Tepper is really just another selfish and self-centered New YOrk slob who'd rather give you the finger than the time of day.Still a funny if deceivingly simple story of the Gogol type."
2,Somewhat entertaining,"It's an OK read, not a waste of time, but nothing special. Not laugh-out-loud funny by any means, but a bit amusing at times. Pretty unrealistic story, and a few of the characters (notably the mayor) are overdone charicatures."
4,Join Tepper in the front seat,"Tepper is an ordinary, middle aged New York resident who likes nothing more than to source out a good parking spot (always legal and always paid up in full), and quietly sit and read his paper. This quirky but harmless behavior strikes a chord with his fellow New Yorkers who come to see Tepper as a heroic ""everyman"", a guy who just wants to sit in peace and do his thing. Tepper becomes somewhat of a minor celebrity, in the process raising the ire of the ultra uptight Mayor Ducavelli. Join Tepper for his unlikely adventure in New York, you'll be smiling all the way through."
2,Just OK,"I would have rated this novel much higher if Trillin were able to write dialogue between his characters more successfully. The interior voice of Tepper is actually quite good--funny, well-written--and I think New Yorkers will love some of his observations about their town. However, when the characters start speaking to each other the language gets very stilted and I have the feeling of being in a play--specifically a really bad Arthur Miller play. Especially the words coming out of Linda's mouth--awful! Who talks like that? As the novel gets going there is more and more dialogue. If the story sounds interesting to you please pick this book up from your local library and read just the first chapter (before he starts talking to anyone)."
4,A Book About Nothing,"This is a book about nothing in the same respect as ""Seinfeld"" was a show about nothing. I found nothing particularly moving about the main character Murray Tepper and his quirks. However, the story is an entertaining jab at the government and spoils system like the one that has become evident in Washington.Tepper isn't going out. If he is going to have to pay for parking, he should get his money's worth. This simple philosophy of life attracts complete strangers to him. While drawing the support of the populous for his stance, he ruffles the feathers of the mayor. This mayor will soon me seeking reelection but feels threatened by the lawlessness that Tepper represents. Unfortuantely for the mayor, Tepper has broken no law.At a certain point in the book, I could not sympathize with the main character. If you can't find parking, move out of the city. I know that's why I live outside the city. Still, the book has entertainment value."
2,I laughed alot,A great satire on life in a big US city. Trillin captures the frustration associated with battling life's daily problems; and the obvious incapacity of the politicians who try to make it all work. The parking thing is a clever metaphor.I moved out long ago. A few days visit to such a place is more than enough. Give me small town America every time.
3,Parking Woes in the Big Apple,"Murray Tapper, a delightful low-key gentleman, has taken up reading his paper in his Chevy Malibu at various metered parking spots. He is impervious to drivers who want him to move on. Murray doesn't move until the meter runs out. (Murray is a very law abiding man.)""Tapper"" is what we used to call in English Lit. class, a ""slight"" novel. It takes a small subject and studies all of its ramifications. It is a credit to Mr. Trillin's deft touch that we willingly follow Murray's trials and triumphs at the meter. Mr. Trillin is fearless in that only a sub-section of New Yorkers (not just ""New Yorkers,"" but New Yorkers who own cars) can really appreciate the ironies of Murray's story.An enjoyable read, but one that is better suited to a short story in ""The New Yorker."""
5,Hillarious,I read this book in one sitting and really enjoyed it. I have been enjoying articles by CT for some time and this book confirms my view that Calvin Trillin is one of the finest humorists in the U.S.
4,Entertaining novel.,I purchased this book as part of my summer work reading program - very entertaining and has some great ideas and humor to apply to the office.
3,Not Trillin's finest hour,"I wanted to love this book. In a sense, it has everything I live about Calvin Trillin's writings: his low-key approach, turns of phrase, characters slowly going about their business in a Zen-like calm. But it never really seemed to catch fire. I now know that Trillin wrote this after the death of his wife/muse Alice, so it was probably more a of a project to get him through that terrible time, rather than a novel he put his all into.It's amusing but not his best work."
4,Tepper is Laugh-Out-Loud Funny,"Trillin at his finest. Tepper Isn't Going Out is one of the few books that can make me laugh out loud hysterically. Believe it or not, this entire novel focuses on Tepper's quest to find the perfect parking spot in parking challenged New York City. Trillin has somewhat of an obsession with parking and even started a magazine about parking in New York. His obsession translates into hilarity."
5,great sound,great sound in small size with a rational price. I have it in my ktichen but thinking in have antoher one for my bedroom
4,Does what you'd expect,"I bought an Uncle Mike's Sidekick vertical holster for a large-frame revolver. When I got it, I noticed it has a large plastic piece on the opposite side of the holster, which is generically referenced in the instructions as being ""for holster accessories"".I ordered this cartridge holder on the chance it would work, and it fits this bit of the holster perfectly. .44 shells fit this holder snugly, and feel very secure. It's not made in the USA anymore though, which is unfortunate. But other than that, it works and fits just fine."
3,good,good item as usual...i purchase these things all the time...it fits my ammo perfectly...i'll buy more when the time comes...
5,A JEWEL IN ITALIAN BAROQUE,"If you want to hear magnificient expressed early music from the craddle just buy this one. It's a must in every collector search related with Early and baroque music. Beatifully directed and arranged, like Eeverything Gabriel Garrido did."
5,Grand!!! What a great way to celebrate Queen,This sheet music is a wonderful way to be inspired by Queen and the arrangements that made them who they were. They are timeless
1,Not as advertised,"This is advertised as being written for vocals, guitar, and piano. Well, that's partly true. The only way I can figure it out is that the notes are given for whatever is playing the melody. So if the vocals are the melody, those are the notes you are seeing, but if the piano is playing the melody, it will switch to that without telling you that there's a change in instruments, therefore you're not getting the full arrangement for each instrument, only what is in the melody. It will give you the full arrangement for the vocals, but I'm guessing most people are buying this for the guitar/piano. If I'm wrong about my assumption above, then this book is just WAY off and doesn't deserve to be in publication. I'm not an amateur, I've been playing for 9 years and this thing is the biggest clusterf*ck I've ever seen."
5,"Great selection. I wish they released an ""Anthology II"".","Very accurate and easy to understand. In order to make it perfect I'd include tabs for the guitar section, but it's no big deal. The selection is great. Perhaps it's about time to release another book??? There's so many songs I can hardly think a single book Anthology would do."
3,For Beginners and Queen Fans,"This book is overall a good choice. It has almost all of Queen's best hits. A great book for beginners. However, more advanced players might find it too simple and dissappointing because none of the songs are note for note the piano part as heard on tracks, most of them are not even that close. You often end up playing the melody with some chords here and there."
2,Don't bother.,"I bought this book hoping for some good tabs to a few classic Queen songs. What I got was nothing better than a lead sheet. The tabs are fundamental chord changes with no tabbing of fills or solos. Why would anyone buy this? If you can already play the songs, you don't need it. If you know everything but the solos, you won't get anything you don't already know.The only person this book will benefit is the person who doesn't know what chords are present in these songs and only wants to learn the fundamental rhythm of each track. Overall, not very useful, and a real slap in the face to guitar players like me who truly appreciate Brian May's work and would like to learn some of his signature licks. Overall, very disappointing."
3,holding up well over time,"These earrings were even prettier 'in person' than in the photo. When I first bought them, I had serious concerns. The hinges seemed to have too much 'play' in them. I also had to bend the prong down gently to get it to slip into the hole. I worried about the earrings falling off, or the hinges falling apart. I've had them for quite a while now, and they have held up just fine. They haven't come open unexpectedly, and they still look beautiful. I'd upgrade the star rating if Amazon would let me!"
3,Where's the REVERB???,"The (2nd to last) previous poster has it right on! I was disappointed that this cd was ""remastered."" I used to listen to my album years ago and the drum intro of Dallas 1pm sounded fantastic - just the right amount of reverb. Now, it sounds as if someone merely transferred the dry master tracks without ANY effects! Yes, the songs are still great, butthe production took a HUGE step backwards - a pity. And the track re-ordering is another snafu.... Dallas 1pm at the end??? WHY???"
2,Disappointing Remaster,"I have to agree with the reviewer from Grenada. This is a disappointing CD. My biggest gripe is the song order. Luckily my US release cassette still plays! And for the sound quality...Dallas 1PM sounds like it was recorded in a small sterile studio. The original version sounded like it was recorded in a big dirty warehouse with a big fat sound. Especially on the drum intro. All of the reverb is gone. I only gave it 2 stars because if you HAVE to have it on CD, then you have to have it."
5,"Wicked, awesome, totally amazing CD....","Enough said! If you only buy one CD this year, this should be it...if you buy two CDs this year, get two copies. Well, maybe that's overdoing it, but hey, you might wear the other one out from playing the totally infectious tracks over and over again. Consider yourself warned: Your friends may become addicted to ""All You People""...."
3,maybe I was using it wrong...,"All the other reviewers think this was the best thing, so maybe I was just using it wrong or something. I had a lot of trouble with it scraping the sticky off my mat. The spatula would get gummed up fairly quickly. Maybe it was an issue with my mat. Anyway, I don't use it anymore, I just use a fingernail to get under the edge and pull up carefully. But for the price, I'm still not sorry I bought it."
1,why do you need it?,"I just bought my Cricut and I do not have this tool and see no need for it. I have fingernails! And if it gets as gooey as people say then it is scraping the stickiness off the mats, which is one of the major complaints about mats: they lose their stickiness way too soon. I will not be buying this."
1,"very flimsy, not worth any amt of money....","This is such a cheap thing, I feel like I wasted my money. I could have gotten something much better quality in the kitchen section or something. The metal flexes it is so flimsy. NOT recommended!"
5,Cricut Spatula Tool,"Great tool! It is slim enough to ""wedge"" underneath the paper you are removing. Not limited to just the Brand Name it promotes, but can use it in other brands."
4,Must have,"I got this as a gift with my new Cricut, someone told my husband it was a must have and I agree. It makes removing my creations much easier. Maybe a kitchen tool could be used but this is worth it."
4,Necessary tool,"My GF purchased an original ""OG"" Cricut off Craigslist and it did not have any of the accessories so we picked this up off amazing using our prime account. The spatula arrived a day later and works perfectly with the Cricut mat and cutting system. According to her this thing is awesome and really helps get the cut pieces off the mat easily. It was also cheaper on Amazon than at the local craft store."
2,better than nothing,"This is needed when the paper is too thin to just lift off, as I can with cardstock. However, it is so thick that it still isn't ideal. I use my paint pallete knife, it works even better."
3,worn,No real biggy it's a needed tool when using my cricut. I wore the other one out so I needed another one.
4,Good but sticky,"I like the spatula for picking up intricate patterns. But the sticky stuff on the feeder board builds up on the back of the spatula, requiring frequent cleanings."
4,A real help.,"Having bought new mats for the cricut, the spatula is a real help for getting cut items off without damaging them."
5,Works Great!,Works Great. Gets gummed up but the end is always smooth and ready to peel the paper off without tearing it.
2,don't buy from here!,"i ordered this item on december 7, with plenty of time to have it by Christmas. (the write up says it ships in 5 - 7 days). well, the week before Christmas i get an email saying this item will now not arrive until the middle of january!!! i really needed this for Christmas day, so i ended up going to hobby lobby and purchasing it there on sale... cheaper than $5.99!well, today is december 24. guess what showed up in the mail today?? yep... the cricut spatula! now i have to return one of them. i would love to return the amazon spatula. however, at this point i think it may almost be easier to return the hobby lobby one.the product is nice, but i had a frustrating experience! if you order this online, don't expect to have it in a timely manner!"
5,Perfect for Projects,This is a great gadget for all the Cricut projects I do. The handle seems the perfect length for ease of use. The tip makes lifting projects easy and is wide enough to lift even the most intircate patterns without damaging them.
4,A Must Have,"this is a Must have tool when you are working with thin papers or papers that have lots of cuts on them. I have never had a paper rip when using this tool, if I'm careful while using it. It does pick up some of the sticky off of the mat and that is not a great thing. I don't always use this tool if I'm cutting thicker papers so that cuts down on this tool mucking up my mat. I think the real thing it does is make you more aware of what you are doing, it makes you slow down and think about how you are taking the paper off of the mat. I think it's a must have but I rated this four stars because it may not be what you want/need and because it does sometimes pick up the stickyness off of the mat.Enjoy."
2,to quirky and not enough of that something special!,"Did not like it maybe there was a bit to much dry humor that is for a different type of audience.Beautiful women, nicely shot but horrible one liner jokes ???nough said"
1,Worst attempt period,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever taken time out to watch, period! Never again will I watch another of his attempts at movie making, period!"
1,Awful,Like the title says this movie is downright terrible. Don't waste your money. I can't think of one thing about this that is any good.. well except some hot girls.
1,It wishes it was.,"You can't use intentional lack of quality as an excuse to waste my time, Bill. Fun bad movies are fun by accident because of the filmmakers' incompetence. Faking it is, well, fake. And piling unfunny humor on top of that doesn't help. A movie can't be the worst horror movie ever made unless it is a horror movie. Very simple logic that seems to have escaped you."
5,DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE PLOT....,This movie lives up to its title.. The worst horror movie ever.... lol There's some good looking women that are topless and more. Some good simulated sex symbols.A few close ups of the goods... It was worth the money for the skin. Any movie by Bill Zebub is worth the money.
1,worst horror movie is right,"This movie starts out funny with hot chicks---then gets terrible. Almost nothing funny or hot after about 10 min and its def. not a horror Don't waste your time, Im sorry I did."
1,Movie is misnamed,"This is by the moviemakers' accounts a remake of a movie that was worse. If that is to be believed, the original was for sure the worst movie ever made of any genre. This movie is so awful with disjointed scenes, incomprhensible plot and pretty much the worst acting imaginable, there is no excuse for watching it to the end.The movie appears to be made by adults but has the earmarks of juvenile minds that never got past potty jokes and sexual curiosity. The movie is gross, stupid, occasionally boring and probably drug-induced. Those are its best features. Oh yeah, the credits both opening and closing are creditable. It's just everything between the credits is so bloody useless that whatever it cost me was a rip-off. And it wasn't cheap. For whatever reasons, it's an expensive movie as cheap trash goes. I suppose it's because most people who had it probably threw it away and those who think they want it are forced to pay for its scarcity. Enough said."
1,What a complete waste of time!,"Don't make the same mistake I made... this movie was unbearable. Ugly, ugly super ugly old girls. What a turn off. Why Amazon would even let something like this on thier website is simply amazing to me. Anyone could have made a better video. There is nothing here that could possibly appeal to anyone. Don't rent and don't buy!"
4,The title of this film is truth in advertising,"This movie is absolutely perfect for movie nights featuring 'truly bad cinema' type themes. The special effect are strictly no budget, and the acting abysmal. That said, it reminds me of early student super 8 films by people like Peter Jackson (Dead Alive comes to mind) If you like to collect 'C' films, its worth having as a groaner."
3,lol,"I watched this film with one of my friends,in the end he told me please delete my mobile number from your cell phone !"
4,Some king of Wonderful,This was a very nice story and an easy read. Not so many characters so that you could keep them straight.
3,It's okay,"It had all the usual elements of a Barbara Freethy tale, but I just didn't like the romance, mystery and magic as much in this novel. Perhaps because in this case the reader knows what is happening throughout the story and you have to wait while the characters themselves figure it out? No suspense, but a nice enough read if you're looking for a brainless romance."
5,SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL,WOW! This definitely a must read! It really puts a perspective on life...and what is important. This is the second book I've read of Barbara Freethy and it looks like I'll be reading all her books! I really enjoy the way she writes and keeps you interested to where you don't want to put the book down. I hope you take the opportunity to read at least one of her books to decide for yourself. Happy reading!
3,Sweet.,"Damning by faint praise, perhaps, a sweet story, but not one I'll ever feel the need to re-read. Bland romance."
4,Good read,Great story. Good store line. This is The first time of have read anything by Freethy. She reminds me of Kristin Hannah.
4,Great Book,I really enjoyed reading this book and liked the main characters. It was well written and was a fast read.
3,Easy read,"You want to vege for a few minutes than read this romance novel. Matt, Caitlyn, and a baby name Sarah. Caitlyn can't have children but we don't know this until the middle of the book. She attaches herself to Matt's niece. Matt's trying to find Sarah's mother. It's a book about the harm parents unwittingly do to their children and the children trying to find wholeness."
5,"Really is ""Some kind of wonderful""",This book is so touching. Two love stories in one as two siblings search for one another and redemption only to find all they needed thanks to one beautiful baby. Absolutely love!
4,First time reader,this is the first time that I have read anything from Barbara Freethy...I enjoyed this book and will read more of her things in the future.
4,Not done reading it just yet,I always like a good quick read this was one that held my interest. I am sure i will read more by this author.
5,oh my god WOW,what an absolute stunning read from start to finish i couldnt put it down and i honestly didnt until i read every last word i loved every minute of it and i know others will too cos its just ... WOW loved it
5,Great romance!,"I really enjoyed this romance and Im glad I found a new author that I enjoy reading. Of course just like all romance novels some parts will make you wince at the cheesiness. I liked how the hero and heroine didnt hate each other from the start and how they didnt jump in bed together until later on in the book. I could see why they loved each other. If you dont like babies in romance novels this book isnt for you. I will gladly pick up another one of Barbara Freethys books. Sometimes though I wish that romance novels werent so cliche. The heroine is always curvy in the right places with long hair and the male is always muscular, with a great butt, and why are there so many bad boy heroes in romances?"
4,Some kind of wonderful,Fun quick reading. Come on now. What the hell can one say about a fluffy little book like this? Got it?
3,Not Freethy's Best,"I enjoyed this book enough to finish reading it of course. And it was well written as all of Freethy's books are, but it wasn't my favorite of hers. I enjoyed the characters very much, but I got a little bored with the constant back and forth between the two main characters and felt like they were always having the same conversation."
3,It's ok,It's an okay story for me. I didnt get bored but not the type of book where I couldnt put it down. I will still buy Freethy books though.
5,A Great Novel To Read!,"When Matt's long-lost sister dumps her baby on the doorstep of his apartment, he panics and has no idea what to do with the baby, much less take care of it. He goes to his neighbor across the hall, Caitlyn, and asks her for advice. They start taking care of the baby together, visiting each other to see how the baby is doing, and over time, Caitlyn is awestruck by Matt's good looks, and Matt is dumbfounded by how pretty Caitlyn is, and you can just imagine what happens from there on! Read this amazing book to see what happens from there on!"
4,Good read for a snowy day,"I like the story ,nice story with a happy ending for interesting peaple,Some Kind of Wonderfull. is a good read"
4,Cute,"I have never read anything by Ms. Freethy, but I plan on reading more. It was just what I wanted to read and it filled the need. Can't wait to read others by her."
4,Loved it!,I loved the humor and tenderness between the characters! I am looking forward to reading more of Barbara Freethy's work!!
4,Likeable,"The story line held my attention throughout most of the book, however there were some filler portions, which I found unnecessary or a little too wordy, so I had to like; instead of love this read."
5,very good book,"I was surprised by how much I liked this book. I read it twice in two weeks. This was my first B. Freethy book, and will certainly not be my last. I am very curious about her other novels. The book is not too steamy by current standards, but thank heaven for that, because she actually crafts a very good story, and allows the reader to understand the characters. It is high on emotion, and I found myself falling in love with the hero and heroine. excellent book. very unlike other novels where a boatload of bedroom scenes surrounds a skeleton of a ""plot"" (ie. Shannon Mckenna)"
3,Beach or airplane reading,"Cute book, easy to read, don't have to think much. Sometimes it is nice to read something that is an easy little book."
2,Quality,"This is just it...Why spend time on a single, when you got more and better on their album ""Tyranny For You"".Is it worth the effort to stick in a single for 10 minutes of fun? Stick to the longplaying.""Tyranny for you"" is a great Allboom"
1,Not what I expected,"This product is mislabeled. It should have been labeled a multivitamin, as it includes only a small amount (7.5 mg) of CoQ10 per tablet, along with about 30 other ingredients. I chose instead a product that has only CoQ10 and has 100 mg per tablet."
4,twinlab maxlife CoQ10,Nice to have a multi-vitamin with CoQ10 for a change. My only gripe is that you have to take 2 caplets at a time; other multivitamins I've seen have only a 1 caplet dose.
2,Great music butchered by remixes.,"I bought this cd because Limi-t 21 is one of the best merengue bands from P.R. However,I asume someone at the record company decided to include only part of all the best known songs from their first albums in a ""mix"" and complete versions of ""filler"" songs."
4,You'll Grow To Appreciate It,"My appreciation for this book grew with time. At first you may not like it very much because it can be very rigorous at times. There are great topics in the text that you will not find in others. After using and understanding this book, your level of mathematical maturity should be raised."
1,very boring,Many definitions in the book are unclear. Proofs are unnecessary complicated while there is a simple straightforward proof. The problems really are too straight forward that I do not get practice at all. I would suggest to buy the other book to get a better basics in real analysis
5,Most Complete undergraduate text in Functional Analysis,A must buy for students who want to major in Math or pursue graduate study in Math. The book will prepare a student for higher courses in Functional & Real Analysis
4,"He and I have a different definition for ""practical"" but good anyway","While not way out there like some books on meditation, he still attempts to convince you that you should believe in an unexplainable spiritual world. I'm an engineer and I just don't buy this. However, the sell is not hard and the vast majority of the book is just guided meditation and mindfulness. It did help me to begin learning the techniques and I therefore recommend it."
5,Tells how Medicare should be restructured,"Proposed Medicare 'reforms' will hurt seniors and consumers alike: Medicare's Midlife Crisis tells how Medicare should be restructured to help reduce the impact of change on those who need it most. Medicare's growth, Blevins argues, has forced seniors into restrictive health choices and has raised issues of privacy. Issues of freedom of choice for seniors come into play as Blevins examples the problems of a single-payer government healthcare system."
1,Zero Hour...Zero Score,"What a dissapointment. I guess I picked this one up because of the Clancy name, but after Power Plays 6, ""Cutting Edge"" I guess I should have known better. I only read about 40 books a year, and I'm really sorry I wasted my time on this one. This is truly one of the worst books I have ever read. Imagine 4 pages dedicated to describing a man entering a building and walking to the elevator. Or how about 5 pages describing a mother walking to her car. If this appeals to you, then by all means, invest your time in this 330 page disgrace of a novel. Tom Clancy should be embarrassed to have his name associated with such poor writing and imagination."
1,Why did i want to read this book?,"This is my first Tom Clancy Novel I have ever read, and possibly the last one I will ever read. In my eyes as a reader, there was hardly and action in this novel or possibly non what so ever. I sometimes even wanted to stop reading at times because I became very bored with it even after reading three pages of this novel. There are even some times when a character is described but is totally irrelevant to the main story. This was a terrible waste of paper due to this and it was a total waste of my time. There are a lot more book that I would probably have more interest in a lot more books than reading this shallow novel . I don't think I've been so upset at a novel in my life before but like they say there's a first time for everything and this is definitely a first time for me. This was an utter disappointment I recommend this to...nobody, that's right nobody."
1,If 0 stars were an option that would be my vote,"This book is not worth reading. I made the mistake of not putting it down despite the horrible condescending tone of the author, waiting for the book to get better, hoping the rambling, unconnected attempts at a plot would congeal into something of substance. IT NEVER HAPPENED. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed and mad at myself for wasting my time on a novel before. Indeed, I have never been driven to write a review before but hope I can save someone the pain of reading this poorly written, uninspired pulp.How can Clancy let his name appear on the cover?I am also going for another first here. I'm going to tear the book apart and throw it in the trash. It needs to be recycled."
1,Tom Clancy it is not!,"This book purports to be a Tom Clancy - it is not! It has to be the worst book I have ever read. The plot is convoluted to the point of boredom. The 'English' is dreadful and the structure terrible - no 'chapter' is longer than a couple of pages. I don't know which book Mr Nostrum read but it sure as hell wasn't this one! I will not be buying any more Tom Clancy - lesson learned! It is a disgrace that second rate authors should masquerade as well known writers - a clever selling ploy - it fooled me - once. If you want a good nights sleep, buy this book!"
1,Don't bother buying this one from amazon the print is so small you need a microscope to read,The print only covers half of the page it was reproduced using the wrong font and nobody took the time to even look at it.
4,Good Continuing Series,"This book is the third in the series and keeps the same feel as the first books. Jonathon Barret travels to England to search for Nora, the woman who made him a vampire, and gets into trouble which has a surprising outcome. The book really is great, even though I don't do a very good job describing it."
4,The Ant Bully is a must read!,"I loved this book so much when my teacher read it, I had to buy my own copy. I'm a senior in college and I thought it was so cute. It also had a good moral...Be kind to everyone because you never know when you may need them on your side!"
3,This is a re-vamp of a book from 1960...,"(I wonder if the orig. author knows of this book/movie? Her name/title do not appear anywhere in the credits) Somewhere around 1966, my third-grade teacher read aloud to our class the story ""City Under the Back Steps"" by Evelyn Sibley Lampman in which 2 children get shrunk down to ant-size and go to live in the ant colony under their home's back porch, the predecessor to Ant Bully. (search in Amazon for this title and see the reviews) The story teaches thoughtfulness along with ""ant facts"". Unfortunately, this book is no longer in print but it is so close in story line to Ant Bully, that I'm sure many others will recognize it. If you can get your hands on a copy of City Under The Back Steps, buy it!"
2,"Great feel and flow, not enough ink...","These e-gel pens have the smoothest, easy flowing ink -- glides on with ease, looks great -- a pleasure to write with.But the pens themselves come with very little ink inside (not even a quarter full) so they only last a couple of weeks or so, if that. Not worth buying again unless they stop skimping on the ink."
5,My favorite pen,This is my favorite disposable pen. I've had my last two secretaries orders these specifically for me after our practice stopped purchasing them. The ink flow is smooth and consistent and doesn't require as much effort as other pens I've tried. This makes a difference when I'm filling up 10-30 pages with notes at a time in that my hand isn't as fatigued. I use the black mostly. The blue ink doesn't seem to flow quite as well but I don't use it that often. The pen lasts until the ink / gel interface reaches the point. I've not had any of the clips break off like on some cheaper pens. They are worth the extra cost.
4,A must read for the physical conditioning specialist,"This is a high level scientific book. Before reading it you should be familiar with knowledge of human anatomy and exercise physiology - undergraduate level.If you want to read about everything you need to know about physical conditioning in just one book this is what you were looking for.I've expected some more information on the athletic training subject, but you can not hope to find everything the exercise science has to offer in a 650 pages book. However the book respects its title ofering you ""the essentials"".I also admire the author's objectivity about some athletic nutritive supplements - it is telling you that you shouldn't waste your money on many of them.Because it is not written by a single author it makes you look back and forth and sometimes repeats some information.Overall is a complete and reliable resource of scientific knowledge. I go back to it anytime I think I need to remember something."
5,what a book!,"I needed this book for a class, but I'm so glad I've got it. I have purchased many books to help improve my knowledge in this area, but this is one of the best. Very easy to read; chapters are very digestible. The chapters continue to build on one another rather than taking one topic and then dropping it for the rest of the text."
4,Great Book,"If you are studing for the CSCS exam this is your book. And I should stress this is the ONLY review material that you need, the other ""review"" materials are a waste of time and money. This book does an excelent job preparing you for the test--read the chapters take the tests at the end of the chapters and you should pass with flying colors. As a side note, yes this book is rather dry, however there is NO other book that covers the entire relm of strength training as well as this book--yes, there are better speciality books than this one and yes there are books that are easier to understand--but as far as covering all the bases, this is the best I've found. It also has good color pictures--as opposed to Designing Resistance Training Programs."
4,It's Deepak,"Easy to comprehend philosophy. Practice daily, and you may be amazed at what you find. The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success go well with this one."
5,Quick Read,Great book to give to anyone for the Holidays who is in business or thinking of going into some new venture! good book and a quick read.
3,"Inspiring, but what do you do next?","I found the book to be inspiring, but at the end, I am left with the feeling of ""Great, but what do I do now to solve my financial problems and create greater wealth"". Still it is a good read, but I think that there are better books on the subject. Please see my other reviews."
2,I was expecting more from this cursory book,"This book is quite short and can be read in about an hour.Frankly, I was expecting more. It's really like a long brochure or outline rather than a book. While it did offer a few helpful points, it did not go enough in depth in expanding upon them. After reading this book, I felt like I had read an outline or a proposal to a book rather than an actual book. Thus, I regret my purchase of this book."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!,I can not even consider this a book. It is more of an article. And not a very inspired one. It doesn't get absolutely boring because is short. And overprized. Don't waste your money on this s...
2,Not a great book,"This book is simple and could be read in a very short amount of time... that is if you choose to finish it. I did not finish it. I just could not get into it. I loved The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams and would recommend it to everyone. This book just fell short in my eyes.Robbie Dawg Organic Dog Biscuits: Peanut Butter & CarrotOrganic Quilted Car Seat Cover: SilverTux Dog Treat Chew Toy: Aqua BlueHemp Eco Friendly Dog Bone Toy: Pink (Large)Hemp Eco Friendly Dog Bone Toy: Key Lime (Small)6"" Knitted Fabric Dog Toy with Squeaker: Percy (chicken)Zisc Flying Disc Dog Toy: Granny Smith"
2,Too wordy,"I love to hear Mr. Chopras talks, but his books, at least the ones I've tried to read, are not so interesting. He tends to go off on tangents and the result is confusion. He has a couple of novels out as well. Please, don't bother with these, especially if you're accustomed to great fiction. But I shouldn't talk, off on a tangent of my own. So back to this book. I didn't become affluent, did you?"
2,More Chinese Crap,"I was looking for a good solid heavy built scoop. The vendor did not provide any info on where the item was made. Hoping that it would be a well built scoop I opened the package only to find that it was poorly made light weight cast aluminum ""made in China"". I will keep the scoop to try but doubt that it will last through the summer feeding the show steers. I wouldn't buy this scoop unless you are only scooping flour or small grain. I gave it 2 stars only because the price was good. The product is simply light weight imported Chineses cast aluminum with poor workmanship and poor quality."
1,Not up to Crunch's usual standards,"I usually really like Crunch videos, but I can't recommend this one. I've been doing step aerobics for 8 or 9 years, but I found the moves in this video to be too complicated to be effective. You spend so much time concentrating on trying to follow them, you end up hardly breaking a sweat. Also, the production quality is not up to the usual Crunch standards, either. If you want a short, fun step workout, skip this one and get Reebok's Dance Step with Petra Kolber -- like this video, it has a quick pace and assumes you are an intermediate-or-better stepper, but it uses basic and moderately complicated moves instead of the unnecessarily complicated ones this video uses."
2,...,"... I'm not the most advanced stepper, but certainly an intermediate one. Not only is the routine complex - which would be okay in itself - but it goes against the way our bodies naturally move! So the whole time I felt like I was on the verge of tripping over my own feet! Understand, I gave this the good ol' college try - and stuck to it through the end on 3 occasions. But even after learning the moves, it still just felt wrong... I gave it two stars for the cute lady on the left which I think now stars in V.I.P."
3,Tricky stepping,"This tape was so annoying at first, thanks to the tricky footwork, but after 3 tries, I finally have the moves down and I'm enjoying it. The problem is that the moves are alot more complicated than they need to be for a good workout, and rather than build on the steps you've learned, the instructors removes steps as the routine advances. That made me want to take this one to the used CD/video store, but now I'm glad I didn't.The music really gets you going, and you feel like you're dancing rather than exercising much of the time. The best way to learn the moves quickly is to watch the instructor's legs carefully. It takes some concentration at first (more than one should have to suffer through in a step video), but after that hurdle is past, you'll find this to be quite a fun video."
2,"Try another one, this one is destined for the top shelf!","I consider myself an advanced stepper, and this tape was extremely hard to follow with overly complicated moves.Your money is better spent on Kathy Smith Fat Burning Breakthrough or Crunch - Fat Blaster the Next Step."
2,I agree...,"I have had my share of step choreography over the years. I have to agree that this tape was frustrating. I literally had to lower my step, rewind the tape and do part of the workout over again just so that I could feel like I had gotten decent exercise time in. A lot of the time, I was so busy trying to get the steps that I found myself not stepping on the step, and what good is that? I imagine with a few tries, I would be able to get it down. Mostly though, I think it is poor cueing from the instructor more than anything else. She switches feet without saying anything and changes the steps midway. You truly need a high tolerance for frustration to do this workout."
2,Stepping in Confusion,"I purchased the DVD with Crunch Fat Blaster and Step & Sweat. The Step and Sweat was the most confusing and unenjoyable workout. I am a step instructor and I found the work out very difficult to follow, the camera angles added to the confusion and the cues were terrible. I found myself either maintaining a basic step or just watching in order to get my bearings. I recommend the Fat Blaster - the work out is both challenging and fun."
3,Quality concern.,"The music, of course, is terrific; however, the quality of this CD does not appear to be first run. I was very disappointed as I had purchased this as a gift for my husband for father's day."
3,To Stay forever,"This is an ok read, I find it hard to like Damon Niarkos, because he seemed to hate Kendra Jephcott the moment he met her, I know he fell in love with her from jump, but he was so determined not to fall into the same type of money grabing female his friend Eugene Themelis had fallen in with. Kendera's cousin Faye was now pregnant, and she hated everyone, especially her husband Eugene.Damon painted Kendra with the same brush as Faye, and he wouldn't except anything else.Although he fought it with everything in him he couldn't fight the jealousy he felt each time he heard about Kendra and Costos, Eugene's grown up son, or Nigel a friend of Kendra that she was not really interested in romanticly."
3,dated but ok,"I guess some people really like this book. Like the other book, it has an attractive cover, but inside...lacks. The drawings are hard to understand, of not the best quality and would have expected more."
3,"Classic topic, dated presentation","Some of the designs in this book are projects that I definitely intend to build. However, using this book to produce the designs in it requires a good set of woodworking skills and ability to come up with the project based on a minimal presentation. The drawings are adequate, but the photos are very poor quality. Frankly I could produce a better quality presentation on an office copier. Very dated to the 70's and not a book to read just for enjoyment or to look at the pictures."
5,A wonderful book for anybody,"this is a wonderful picture book for anybody. ive given it to many of my adult friends as well as children. everyone of them has said it's been one of their favorits. hehe, also, the writer is my sister so I may be biased."
4,Under the carpet view,"Michael Peppiatt has resources for his book that defy belief. Francis Bacon was indeed an enigmatic person and artist and I suppose that the lurid details of his existence may shed some light on the paintings. But not, I think, to the degree that the author would have us believe. Some of the most glorious works of art have been created by personalities who border on beastial (Richard Wagner, Diego Rivera, Rodin et al) and so I suppose that knowing that Bacon was night gutter tramp may illuminate some of his portaits. The book does add to the literature on Bacon by introducing a number a fascinating photographs and for the reader who needs to know it all, well here is that cluttered closet."
4,A MUST-READ for any Expert Witness!!,"Authors Steven Babitsky and James Mangraviti have penned an eminently practical guidebook for the expert witness. Whether you are a ""newbie"" just starting out or a seasoned veteran of depositions, this book offers dozens of tips that will help you when you sit in the proverbial hot seat.A recurring theme is that there is no substitute for preparation. This time investment should be made easier by knowing that this will pay off during the deposition.The examples are top-heavy with medical/physician vignettes, but this is a minor quibble.The book has some handy Appendices, including a checklist for expert witnesses.I read this book as I prepped for a 30(b)6 deposition - clearly a slightly different context -- and much of the advice is sound here as well.Anyone who does expert witness work or considering doing so should have this book on their bookshelf!! A five-star book!"
5,Fist KIss--Spectacular,This is the most adorable framed print I've ever purchased. My friend who received this was absolutely delighted--her exhuberance was awe inspiring.I wish I could find more posters that complimented this picture.
3,Read more than once,Dr. Crosby is not easy to comprehend on the first read. There is a lot of value to what he says but it must be read slowly and reread for understanding unless you are already familiar with philosophy topics. This is not a book for the beginner.
1,Not usable,The earpieces just come off - won't stay attached. Not usable - a piece of junk. But too cheap to go to the trouble of returning for a refund. Buyer beware.This is the first time I've received a piece of junk like this from Amazon - unlike them to sell such worthless products.
1,Feel robbed,Other terrible reviews are right on the money. Eyebrows and mustaches fell off right out of the bag. Ear pieces unhinged and snapped off right when I straightened them out. I literally paid for garbage. However it's what I expected and I wanted glue the nose on a real pair of glasses. Even that is utterly hopeless as the nose deformed and just stinks of toxic fumes. Zero stars across the board if possible.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I bought several of these at the same time for a party. They are junk. Several of the eyebrows were glued on upside down, the glue was poor and the eyebrows and moustaches came off, and the hair comprising the eyebrows and moustaches shed like a dog or something and it had a tendency to make people wearing the masks choke or gag. These things are pieces of junk. They pretty much went straight to the trash can."
1,Get a better one! This one is a cheap broken piece of crap,"I ordered 2 of these for the kids, and both of them had the following problems:1. One had no mustache at all! Just sticky glue all over the nose where it used to be attached.2. On both of them, the eyebrows were falling off, not glued all the way across or well enough.3. Hair on them was falling off all over the place, what a mess!4. The rubber nose smelled SO bad the kids won't even play with them.5. The rubber nose is attached so poorly they will most likely fall off after 1-2 uses.These are overall just bad... typical of many things made in China these days.We will order other ones that cost a bit more maybe."
1,Garbage,"It isn't that they were falling apart in the bag, i could have lived with that. But it looks like someone shaved the hair off the eyebrows and mustache. I wanted these for one goofy photo. So I could have taped things together if they were just poorly made. But they look terrible. Seriously, like Groucho Marx is on chemo. The little hair on the eyebrows and mustache falls off when you touch it. It's like someone tried to make a bad product.I know it's silly to get bent out of shape about a cheap product, but this didn't used to happen on Amazon. Time to sell your Amazon stock."
1,Terrible!,"First, this ships from SINGAPORE, so it took forever to get here.Second, these look like they are supposed to fit a toddler kiddo. I ordered them for my 7 year old and I they're TINY!Third, they were in terrible shape when the arrived. Eyebrows were falling off and already off. The nose was broken off and they were in TERRIBLE shape.Conclusion, order them from somewhere else because this seller/product is a joke. I ended up just throwing these away, they will never make it to the Christmas stocking."
5,Fuzzy Nose Glasses,Had ordered 6 pair for Halloween. Was disappointed they came a week late. But pleased with the distributors response. The items are just what I had ordered. Will use them next year.
3,"Good glasses, side pieces a little short however.","No real complaints about the glasses other than the side pieces are a little short and don't reach my ears, so the glasses don't stay on well. I suppose they're designed for kids though, so that should have been expected."
1,Junk,Needed this for an educational show I present. Didn't work. Too small and uncomfortable. May be fun for one wearing by a kid - but I doubt it.
4,Toys for boys,"My adult son was looking for a pair of these. I think they are the best we have found so far (a different pair from a different company broke immediately)in terms of best look and fit. The front frame fits an adult face fine; however the side temple pieces are not long enough to fit comfortably and securely on an adult head. They just catch his ears, instead of going fully over them."
5,An excellent disguise,"Ah finally a decent disguise at a decent price point. I am quite impressed at the engineering that went into these glasses. Not only do you get eyeglasses, but there is also a nose attached!! And only to further the craftsmanship, there is a mustache ATTACHED to the nose!! This singular device has allowed me to finally ditch the WIT SEC detail and.... wait, who's that in the shadows?!??! THEY HAVE A GUN!!!! WHY AM I STILL TYPING????? *blam* Crud. Guess my disguise wasn't all i had cracked it up to be. *bleeds out*"
4,"beautiful earrings, loose clasp, $99","I bought these earrings for about $99.00 - I don't know why they cost so much more now. They are truly lovely, but the clasp on one of the earrings is very loose. One of the earrings fell out of my ear and I thought it was lost forever. Fortunately, it turned up MONTHS later."
4,Good resource,This is a very basic overview of how to start an ESL ministry. It is good for what I wanted it for but someone needing a lot of technical information on ESL learning would need more. The book provides an extensive bibliography and resource list. I've used the resource list more than anything. Good basic info.
3,Does the job.,"These work great for growing corals. Unlike t5 or LEDs though you cannot control if it's actinic only, or 10k only. This isn't a huge deal, but buyers may wish to know this. These are a far cheaper route than buying a t5ho system. I used 2 of these bulbs over my 10 gallon tank for ~6 months. After 3 months both bulbs began to fade and had to be replaced. They are cheap enough however where that wasn't a huge deal, but I have since upgraded to an LED lighting system."
3,"Showed up shattered, no packaging material at all","This shipped to me rattling around in a big empty box and it was shattered into a million pieces. Called the company to complain and they shipped me a new, better packaged bulb, but I had to wait an extra week to get it. The second bulb worked great, no complaints."
5,great shampoo basin,My daughter who has Cerebral Palsy recently under went surgery.I could not put her in the shower.This shower basin was a god send although I do have to put a protective pad under her to keep from getting the bed wet...her neck is a little short for it
4,Music that makes you write and think,"This wonderful insrumental CD was highly rated by my students. As a writing teacher, I often play music as a motivator/stimulant in the classroom. Cullen Offer was an all time favorite. Not only did this CD calm behavior, inspire writing; students could readily identify instruments; and genre. Wonderful selection of songs and rhythm. Great for the classroom and relaxing at home. I hate to even admit it was stolen from my classroom!"
1,"Bent neck, Really? Not returnable, really? I was jipped!","I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift. When he got it, we had a friend come over to tune it, but was not able to tune it. We took it to a guitar store and they said the neck was bent and it was worthless. We contacted the seller, but since 30 days had gone by since I first bought it until we found out, he would not return it. So, we are stuck with a worthless bass guitar and I'm out the money. Very sad and disappointed."
1,Not a Good Album,"I'm a Damien Jurado fan, but this is not a strong album at all; the cover art and title are the only appealing aspects. You would be much better off ordering one of his other albums, like Rehearsals for Departure or Water Ave S. A few of the songs on Gathered in Song sound like early recordings for songs on RFD, and they sound much better on RFD. He's a great artist; this just isn't a good album."
2,Rather rediculous plot twists,"If you're looking for a ""thriller"" with little substance that won't tax your brain too extensively, go ahead and give this book a look (I suggest checking it out from your library, so as to avoid buyer's remorse).Meltzer began with a decent premise for this story, but there were so many inane comments made by the characters, so much ""facial communication"" between the Hardy Boys, so much cliche bad-guy stuff going on that his promising story became a nearly 500-page head-shaker. I can't remember the number of times I read a paragraph and said to myself, ""what a convenient plot twist - yeah, that might happen!""For those readers who think Meltzer is one of the great novelists of the day, I suggest you pick up one of Tom Wolfe's novels. Wolfe will show you what results when an author focuses on substance rather than volume, on painstaking research rather than simply putting every neat idea he's come across onto the page."
1,Audio Version,The audio for this book is absolutely horrible. The reader is the worse I have ever heard.
3,"Fast read, Grisham type of book","This book was a fast read and entertaining. It had the same formula as most of John Grisham's books. It's the type of book that Hollywood usually puts on film, so I wouldn't be surprised if I see it at the theaters soon."
2,Ridiculous fantasy,"As suggested on the back cover I thought I would find a financial thriller with all the gizmos and covert procedures to steal big money off the legal bank system and with very well outlined characters. But what I indeed found is a poor story written with a lot of sense of humor, but failing to transmit any credibility about the subject matter, and that keeps the ball rolling with a confusing plot and many senseless plodding turns that stretches for more than 500 pages draining the attentive energy of the reader. In addition, I do not like plots that do not exhibit any background research like this one. After this read I expect not to try Meltzer for a long time"
1,"So ridiculous that it should be titled ""THE ZILLIONAIRES""","Give me a break with this outrageous novel. The characters are so unbearable that you want to punch someone or rip the book to pieces with your teeth. Oliver and Charlie (the main characters) act more like lovers than brothers. They touch each other tenderly, can read each other's thoughts and communicate just by looking at one another. Obviously Meltzer never had any real-life brothers. And the plot? Anyone who ever worked at an investment bank would realize that this ""scam"" is akin to saying you're going to dress up like the Pope, sneak into the Vatican and steal all the gold bullion they have locked in the Papal safe (Don't steal that idea Brad). Save yourself, I wasted ten bucks, don't you. Re-read Nelson Demille's 'The Gold Coast' or how bout 'Bonfire of the Vanities' or buy 'The Corrections'."
4,Much better ending,"I was nervous reading this book, because while I love and get totally enthralled with Meltzer's books, I tend to be disappointed with his endings. This one, however, did not disappoint.But, more so than loving the story, I really loved the characters. If you have a sibling, which I do, this story will make you smile - simply because of the very realistic portrayal of a sibling relationship!These brothers are great - their dialog is great - and, more to the point, their talking without dialog is great! It's worth the read...both for the story, and for the relationship between these two, very different brothers!Great job Meltzer - you are getting better and better!"
1,"Interesting premise, poor writing","Meltzer's premise of bank account theft by way of a clever computer software virus is compelling, but his storytelling is tedious, amateurish, jumpy and confusing. There are really about twenty important pages in the book, and the rest can be skimmed as quickly as your eyes can travel over the silly dialogue of these mostly undeveloped characters. Having seen Meltzer on TV talk shows, I expected more, and was sadly disappointed."
3,Good...predictable ending...but good,"This book has very good potential in being a great book. It has characters with strengths as well as weaknesses, who feel relatively real. You empathize with them as well as want to smack them every time they do something moronic. This book is well-written and well-paced, but I had figured out who was behind it really, really early in the book and just waited until my prediction was true. Note to reader, go with your instincts and it's pretty easy. But even though I figured it out, Meltzer does keep you intrigued on what will happen next (although his chase scenes go on forever). I would recommend this book to a friend but I think that Meltzer could have done something more with it. Something less predictable and more of a surprise whodunnit(there are a few surprises that are good). To the person who said he is better than Grisham...not even close."
3,Not Bad,"I ordered this book dispite all of the bad reviews written on this site, however, I did keep them in mind before reading the book, preparing myself for the worst. That being said, while The Millionaires may not be a great book it was not a bad book either. The Millionaires is the type of book that you read knowing that it is not exactally going to be War & Peace but you take it for what it is, a light beach read and just enjoy the story, which is exactally what I did and in the end I can honestly say that I did enjoy it."
4,Blues Brothers and a huge bank,"Buy this book before they start making the movie! Oliver Caruso, an employee for the VIP-only Greene and Greene Bank, works for the scumbag and crook Henry Lapidus. Charlie-- Oliver's wayward brother-- somehow persuades do-gooder Oliver to pilfer $3 mil from the bank account of a deceased techno wizard. Unfortunately, others in the bank had planned to the same-- and the $3 mil inadvertntly morphs into $300 mil! So bank thugs, the Secret Service, and an assortment of other characters wind up on the Carusos' tail, in a Blues Brothers redux with twice the humor and suspense.A wonderful follow-up to The First Counsel. Cardboard characters but the moral dilemma is interesting-- two Robin Hoods, and you can't help but root for them. Following the Caruso's misadventures is a fun way to spend the weekend."
3,Not Bad,"I ordered this book dispite all of the bad reviews written on this site, however, I did keep them in mind before reading the book, preparing myself for the worst. That being said, while The Millionaires may not be a great book it was not a bad book either. The Millionaires is the type of read that you enter into knowin that its not going to be great but you take it for what it is and just enjoy the story which is exactally what I did and in the end I can honestly say that I did enjoy it."
4,Good stuff,"By and large, this is a good book.The writing itself isn't actually the stuff great literature is made of, but it's fun and entertaining to read.The narrative point of view switches off from 1st person to 3rd every few chapters. It can be kind of confusing at first, but you get used to it eventually.The storyline and events seemed a bit ""unreal"" in some bits, almost like something out of a cartoon. But that doesn't really matter. Like I said, it's just plain fun."
2,Same,"The dialogue and the plot is not much different from ""The Tenth Justice"", so if you like that it is fine. Otherwise I found it to be without much new thinking and creativity.If you have the choice, read something else."
2,The Millionaires was not up to par,"I have read Meltzer's The First Counsel and found it a fast paced enjoyable read. The Millionaires, while an easy read, just did not grab me. I found the interplay between the brothers Oliver and Charlie, somewhat sophmoric. While I don't recall getting their ages, this read more like a Hardy Boys novel than a taut thriller. Many of the sub plots defied credibility. How these two 'boys' go up against two secret service men just doesn't cut it - neither is close to a Jason Bourne type.Just did not seem near the level of Greg Iles, or even Stehpen Coonts (whose books I was reading concurrently).I may try another Meltzer novel just to see if this was an anomaly or more typical of his fare."
5,Entertaining book!,I read this quite a while ago but it was super good and I enjoyed it. It moved fast and kept me interested all the time.
2,Brad Meltzer's The millonaires,"I have spent 6 days trying to finish this book, this is not brad meltzer best work.I have been a fan and i'll probale tryhis next book."
3,Scrambled Book,"The problem with this book is that the author doesn't know whether to be funny or serious. It's written with a slapstick tone and you think you're gonna be laughing throughout. But then real blood begins to flow. So, hey, maybe it's a serious book. But the plot, which is promising at first, soon becomes ridiculous -- comically so. The two Caruso brothers spend the book running away from two Secret Service heavies while other characters come and go. In the end, the book's denouement takes place in the tunnels below Disney World. Which is appropriate because, not only is this book a fantasy, it's downright goofy. This is my first Meltzer book and I will have to seriously think whether or not I want to read another."
3,Flawed,"It was difficult for me to stay interested in this book because the characters had no appeal. Liking the main characters is an essential part of a books likability. I just didn't like the main characters at all. It is hard for me to root for someone who is immoral, yet supposedly good."
3,Good enough,"I downloaded the unabridged version of this from I-Tunes, so I gave it a listen. Nothing compares to Meltzer's first book, the Tenth Justice, but this was an interesting enough story. Fine plot twists and OK characters made my long commute a bit more enjoyable."
5,Fast Paced,This was my first encounter with Brad Meltzer and I am anxious to listen to more of his books. The reader's voice on the CD was extremely expressive and could not have been better.
4,What Would You do if You Thought You Wouldn't Get Caught?,"I enjoyed this fast-paced tale by Brad Melzer. Brothers Oliver and Charlie are regular guys in dead end jobs with a stack of life-sucking medical bills to pay and an overworked mother they both adore. They discover the opportunity to commit what they think is the perfect crime; they'll steal three million dollars from a dead man's abandoned account. It's the classic criminal seduction -- no one is going to get hurt, no one is going to get caught, and everyone is going to end up on easy street with all thier problems solved.Predictably, as soon as the deed is done, circumstances spin out of control and the brothers are reminded in one painful way after another that all actions have consequences.A fun and quick read, good for a long rainy day or a boring airplane ride. The writing is tight, the action is non-stop, the characters compelling and the plot interesting."
1,"First step to becoming a millionaire, skips this one","Improbable, implausible are a few words that come to mind. I listened to the tapes (it did pass the time in the car, but if I had had another tape with me, I would have popped this one out) -- the reader/narrator is terrible. His attempt to make the book more suspenseful than it isn't (that's correct -- isn't) was annoying."
2,THE MILLIONAIRES----A TARGET FOR SPAMGUARD,"i BOUGHT THE ""SIZZLE""... GREAT TOPIC IN THESE TIMES.REGRETTABALY, A POTENTIALLY INTRIGUING STORY IS DELIEVERED IN PAGE AFTER PAGE OF SIMPLISITIC DIALOGUE. THE BOOK FAILS TO REVEAL TO THE READER THE REAL INSIDE STORY ON MONEY LAUNDRERING.CHARACTERS ARE SIMPLISITIC ""BUILT""TOO LITTLE STORY BUILDUP AND BACKGROUND.A 40 PAGE SIMPLE STORY ENLARGED ONTO 600+ ( LARGE PRINT) PAGESA REAL LET DOWNA REAL OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY SPAMGUARD TO THE AUTHOR'S WRITING."
4,Good Read!,"Couldn't put it down. Well written and easy to read. Excellent plot line, kept me guessing. I recommend this book and Auther to anyone."
4,Easy reading,The plot was a little silly but kept my attention. Meltzer's writing keeps one in suspense until the end. Look forward in reading more of his work.
2,I expected more,"I am usually a fan of Meltzer's work but it seems I am not a fan of his early stuff. This book was boring. I had a hard time paying attention to it and I kept looking to see how much more I had.The idea seems thrilling. Two brothers decided to move some money from a dead account to their own instead of turning it over to the state. As easy as it sounds to them they end up funneling money out of the account and beat a group of thieves to it. They then become chased by their company, the secret service, and the thieves. This being said I was excited to read this because it did sound like it would be a non stop suspense ride. It was not. I have read it and now I can move on."
3,The Millionaires,"This book is O.K. Not one of his best books, but an interesting read that I finished. Too long for what it accomplished"
2,The Millionaires,"The vendor was ninja fast in shipping the abridged version of The Millionaires, which I greatly appreciated ... it's an intriguing story, however, I would NOT recommend the ABRIDGED audio book. I have listed to both and the UNABRIDGED version is vastly better. The short version cuts out about half of the book. Go for the long version - you won't be disappointed."
3,MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING,"When you read a Brad Meltzer novel, you pretty much know what to expect: some young professional gets caught up in some nefarious scheme and has to rely on either friend or family to get him through, and in this case, suffer the consequences.Brothers Oliver and Charlie Caruso are two banking employees who stumble upon the perfect crime: three million dollars that a dead man has left in the bank, and with no relatives to claim it, the boys decide that since it will go to the government, why don't they just steal it? A moral issue, but justified by the fact that no one gets hurt AND it will help out their debt-ridden mother.Meltzer concocts one implausible scene after another, and yet he's a good enough writer, to hold your interest and make you feel like you haven't been cheated.This one's a little more predictable than most of his previous efforts, and the two brothers aren't all that likeable.Not a bad read, but not Brad's best."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Meltzer makes a creative problem, then unravels it into a very good climax and ending.As far as I can remember, he brings in some funny lines and slapstick comedy, but otherwise, most of the book is actiona nd adventure, pure and simple.As you no doubt have read from other reviews, two brothers work at a ""private"" (""You don't choose them. They choose you."") back, Greene & Greene. The two brothers are total opposites. One is creative and an excellent artist, the other is an executive wanna-be, basically.Meltzer brings in new characters, new plot twists, et cetera. Quite easily, the most enjoyable character is Joey, the female P.I. hired by the bank's insurance company to recover the dough.I would definetely suggest that you read this book, and at $..., it's a steal."
4,3 1/2 stars rounded up to 4,"This was a decent book, but everything seemed a little too neat. A little too Hollywood.The story started off great and had me engaged from the beginning. Too bad things didn't go quite so well from there.It was a bit hard suspending belief at the typical cliches in the book. Moreover, drawing from my own personal experience, I can say without a doubt that one of the plot points in the book was ridiculous. I don't care to really elaborate on that, but just trust me. ;)From a positive viewpoint, though, the book was a fast read and I was anxious to get to the end. Unfortunately, it was a good story that probably would have been better with a little more research and a little less Hollywood. Still, if you're looking for a fun read--which, admittedly, it was--this is a decent book."
4,Computer Worm Creates False Dollars In Upscale Private Bank,Two Brothers working in upscale private bank take a chance on claiming more than $3 million from account of deceased inventor with no heirs. But thru a computer worm buried in the the banks system the $3 million has grown to more than $300 million. Some corrupt Secret Service Agents attempt to get the money for themselves. Kind of a quick though unrealistic but nevertheless fun read.
2,Maybe I'll try Meltzer one more time,"I love reading. Since I've burned through all my favorite authors, I thought I'd try Meltzer, based on some reviews at Amazon. Sorry Brad, you're no Lee Child. Or Joe Connelly. Or..., well, you get the picture.The plot was interesting, and some of the characters, too. The biggest problem with the book was the writing getting in the way of the story. It was distracting, and ""too much of a good thing"" with the brother stuff and goofy dialog between them.Whadda ya think, gang. Should I try another Meltzer?"
3,Just OK,Read this book for the story for there is little else here. I have never read Meltzer but was disappointed. In this volume 2 brothers hatch a plot to get the big bucks. They scheme there way to 313 million dollars but get caught in the act. The book is the story of the brothers being hunted by their competitors.No realism here and not much for the imagination. But the plot moves along and the dialog and flow are not too bad. This book is just short of being real good. Perhaps Meltzer does not have a good grasp on the banking industry. Much of the financial plotting is poorly conceived and not well described.A good summer time beach book but no Grisham.
4,unbelievably good,Overall this book amounted to a good read. I was totally hooked from page one to the last page. I believe Meltzer to be the next John Grishom and hoping his novels don't start becoming watered down and humdrum and tepid like Grishom's novels have become
3,Interesting-but not the greatest,"A fairly good story with lots of techno/banking and info on financial trials and tribulations. The actual theme seemed to be a chase that lasted forever. The twists and turns added some spark but it never glowed as I like a story to do. The family feeling between the two brothers was shown strongly and well, but communications between them by sight was a little hard to grasp. All in all it was a fairly good but not a outstanding read."
3,Extremely Average,"The Millionaires is by no stretch of the imagination a bad book, but that's not to say it's a great book either. How anyone, critic or casual reader, can compare Brad Meltzer to John Grisham is beyond my comprehension. Meltzer's writing style seems very juvenile in comparison with Grisham's. With The Millionaires, Meltzer takes a very simple premise and drags it out to the point that you no longer care about the characters by the end of the book. Weighing in at 479 pages, it is very drawn out, and characters seem to be in the same conversations and situations several times. About 100 pages of the book could have been hacked by the editor. For his next novel, Meltzer needs to take a bit more time to produce quality, not quantity. The Millionaires is definitely worth checking out at your local library, but don't waste the money to buy it in hardcover. This is a paperback purchase at best!"
3,Not as good as his previous work,"Brad Meltzer has become one of my favorite authors. He previous books have been FANTASTIC and have been worth 5 stars. Although I found this book enjoyable to read, it was in no way up to the same high standard of his previous work. It is still worth a read, but if you have read his previous books you will find this one sub-par."
4,Good But Not Written As Well As His Others,The Millionaires starts slow with two brothers who have a crazy idea on how to steal money from the exclusive bank where they work. The story picks up once their on the run. I don't believe this book is as good as the previous book by Brad. I thoroughly enjoyed The Tenth Justice and The First Counsel.
2,"Too many perspectives, too far-fetched","The story was told from 3 separate perspectives, making it very choppy and interrupted. The writing was at a very basic level.Also, the book had chapters about 3 pages long - 89 chapters in this puppy! Why? So the author could add in a ton of unnecessary, silly ""Goosebumps-ish"" (R.L. Stine) chapter endings... ""He saw the gun lift up towards his brother Charlie. ""No!"" Oliver shouted just as he heard the gun go off.""Cut.Next chapter.Puh lease. Of COURSE Charlie wasn't shot, this book has a happily ever after storybook ending. The story-line was also a bit unbelievable. As for the secret ""invention,"" finding it on the disney web site in the manner they did, and the entire Secret Service involvement were all factors too extraordinary and improbable to be believed.Unfortunately, this is the first book I've read by Meltzer, and I won't pick up another of his without a glowing recommendation from a reader whose tastes I share."
1,"Whatever you do, don't get the audio version.","I made the mistake of getting the unabridged version of this book on tape. Spare yourself the misery.Because the plot is too thin to sustain the book's length, you listen to hours of filler, most of which consists of bickering between the main characters, two clueless, boring brothers.To make matters worse, the guy reading the audio version insists on affecting a faux Jewish accent that, again and again, jars you out of the story and rivets your attention on his ineptitude as a reader."
2,Unbelievable tale,"I really enjoyed Mr Meltzer's first book, which was Dead Even. I was very disappointed in this one though. I thought it to be poorly written and very unbelievable. I never could identify with the main characters and so really didn't care what happened to them. I kept reading it hoping it would get better, but it never did. The bad guys were really bad and the good guys were just bad. The only character I liked was Joey and there was not enough of her in the book. From the jacket I was expecting a book like A Simple Plan, which by the way is a real page turner. I am hoping his next book is back up to the standards of Dead Even and the 10th Justice."
2,Good Start... but the Tension Goes With Goofy,"From the beginning, this is an interesting book. The premise is plausible and the execution is pretty good. However it finally becomes that beast we know as a ""Shaggy-Dog story"". That means, a big build up for a low payoff. I must say, when he switched to the Disney World section, I got the feeling he was trying to justify a family vacation to Disney World on his taxes by using it in his book. Bad bad decision, though. The tension immediately was lost when he entered Disney. Also, his Insurance Investigator character was way underused for her build up.Finally, as a person with deep knowledge of computers and web apps, I must say I was embarrassed at his lack of understanding of how computer stuff works."
2,Read His First Two.,"Meltzer's First Counsel and Tenth Justice were excellent reads. The same cannot be said for The Millionaires. While it does have its strengths, Meltzer's latest effort doesn't measure up. The characters are interesting, and his descriptions of both private banking and behind the scenes at Disneyworld are first rate, but even so, Millionaire's plotting doesn't match his first two works. Sadly, credibility is strained nearly to the point that I did indeed stop turning the pages. Too many twists and turns, too many unpredictable identities to be fair to the reader. It isn't a bad novel, but neither is it a great one."
2,How did it get published?,"Have you ever read a really bad book and wonder how it ever got published? The Millionaires is just such a book. This is the first book I've read by this author and unless someone can convince me that this book was the exception rather than the rule, it will be the last. The worst part about the book is the dialogue between the brothers. It had me rolling my eyes often. They even managed to communicate telepathically, which nearly made me laugh out loud. However, instead of giving it only one star, I gave it two because I actually managed to finish it, shaking my head along the way. I didn't care for any of the characters and the brothers were childish at best. Don't waste your time. Avoid it."
4,SAT words in a flash book,This format is very convenient. The book has all of the same words listed in both the official SAT material and the Barron's SAT 2400. Great for on the road studying and has room for you to put a picture or another sentence on the pages.
4,nice looking ring,"the ring is gorgeous but a little bigger than what I thought but still lovely, the red sparkles nicely and looks elegant so I'm glad I bought it and I'm looking forward to buying another one from PalmBeach Jewelry"
5,Life in the Damn Tropics David Unger,"Life in the Damn Tropics portrays the complexity of life for a Jewish family in Guatemala in the 80's. Marcos, the 53 year old protagonist and narrator, is simultaneously struggling to avoid sabotaging a soul saving relationship with Esperanza, a woman with a past, and striving to move forward in his professional life. Not too easy in a tumultous period in Guatemala.Vividly described tension at a early scene in the countryside quickly escalates as the author moves on to provide a white knuckle portrayal of the political violence in Guatemala.The turmoil in the narrator's life and mind ultimately collides with family conflicts, and the corruption and political strife that is occurring in war torn Central America. A great, roller coaster of a read."
4,Compared to the book,I read the book and the book is not only better but the movie changes much of the point of the book. The movie she is treated badly in Japan when the book she was treated for the most part very well during the war in japan. The movie shows her mostly augueing about their defrent belifes where the book they only argued in thier early yrs. I would love to see the movie redone and the script by a woman cause thisman who wrote this script did a bad job in my opion. it is still a good movie to see but I highly recamend the book more.
5,tremendo disco,al escuchar esta segunda produccion de leo vanelly pude darme cuenta del gran crecimiento que ha obtenido el artista a travez de lo anos.estoy seguro que en su natal panama todos se sienten orgullosos de el por poner bien en alto el talento panameño.suige adelante leo que la clase artistica te apoya
2,"They work, but they also NEED some work.","These devices, while well priced and made of good material, need some modification and don't work right out of the box.The shoelaces seem to work well enough for keeping the spikes on your feet, but I've found that the biggest problem is that while climbing the spikes would roll underneath my feet and I'd slip.I had to make some pretty heavy modifications to these things to make them work for me. One being a superior set of nylon straps to replace the shoelaces. And the second being welding a piece of metal to the part of the spikes that touches the bottom of the foot.I say two stars because they worked, but only with heavy modification. If for some reason I needed to buy a second pair, I would buy a pair like these. But be warned that you need to do a little work before these things can actually be useful."
4,Take a breather...,"Taking a long-needed breather from the mud of music digitally transmitted these days, The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex addresses the need for musicians to flex their muscles, stretch and allow their influences to flow. Jimmy Chamberlin and Billy Mohler deliver the truly unique without alienating the fan tied to the rock-song formula.Effectively, this is a jazz album that bridges to alt-rock and somehow keeps it all together. Kudos to Chamberlin for recruiting some varied talent that really works. Rob Dickinson, IMO the most underated songwriter/vocalist/guitarist of the most underated Brit import, Catherine Wheel, is once again, inspiring. The addition of Bill Medley gives Tom Waits a run for his money. For drummers, think Simon Phillips meets-Max Roach-meets Jimmy Chamberlin.This one is staying the cd-player for the near future."
3,Nice,"If you have been trying to convince any dis-believers that Jimmy Chamberlin is an amazing drummer, you now how have concrete proof. From beginning to end his skill dominates Life Begins Again.Unfortunately, this alone does not always carry the songs through. Each is a nice fusion of jazz and rock, but it takes rare talent to create full instrumentals. Jimmy is almost there. That being said, the title track with the mind numbing Rob Dickinson, and Loki-cat with Billy Corgan are some of the best songs I have heard in a years. I recommend Jimmy use his connections to write songs for his friends and colleagues to guest on. Too bad we had to wait so long for this."
2,There are Better Books on the Subject,"I've lived in Mexico for over 30 years and think this guide leaves a lot to be desired. I wonder if the author has ever lived in Mexico for any length of time. John Howell's ""Choose Mexico' is a time-proven classic."
2,Let's get the facts straight,Some information incorrect and not to be found where book directs. Not enough in-depth - very basic.
4,cute costume; quick shipping,Very cute costume. The size medium just barely fit my large pug ( 22 pounds ) but it worked great.
2,Not Aboslute Oil!,"Warning! This is not absolute oil. Ordered two bottles and the label (contrary to the image shown) said ""Jasmine *scented* oil"" and describes the product as mixed with a synthetic jasmine scent."
3,A dazzling aray of music,What a great CD! I listen to it over and over again. It's a CD you just can't get tired of.
3,Read It; Maybe You'll Like It,"Let me preface my review by stating that I'm not done reading this book. I guess that's a bad sign. I do plan to finish it, though.I'll give it to Ms. Danquah - Shaking the Tree is a ecletic collection of women's prose and memoir, but the book is slow. There are selections about racism, politics and sexuality. Yet they don't personally move or stir me. I just can't put my finger on it. I first bought Shaking for its intriguing subject matter, however once I got into it, nothing clicked for me. I give it 3 stars for its efforts.But read it for yourself. It's worth giving a try. Maybe it'll move you."
5,Excellant service and book,This is the best devotional book I have ever read!! The seller was very fast and the book is in the exact condition promised! It's great!!
5,STILL ANNOINTED,"OUR CHURCH'S PRAISE TEAM WENT ON A TRIP TO ILLINOIS. I TOOK THIS BOOK TO THE CORN FIELDS AND SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO READ. I FELT A STRONG TANGIBLE PRESENCE OF GOD!I READ, I WEPT, I READ, I WEPT, FOR HOURS.MR. WIGGLESWORTH'S ANNOINTING IS STILL STRONG UPON HIS WORK. WHAT A BLESSING IT WAS TO BE ABLE TO PARTAKE OF, EVEN AFTER HIS DEATH, MR. WIGGLESWORTH'S ANNOINTING, TEACHINGS,ZEAL, AND MOST IMPORTANT HIS DEEP LOVE FOR GOD. THIS BOOK IS TRULY A TREASURE!"
2,Not your typical Parker album.,"This album seems to loose focus rather quickly. The songs sound a lot alike and the overall theme doesn't really change. Normally, William Parker puts out some high quality things (especially w/ Hamid Drake) so I was surprised to be disappointed with the compositions (if you could call them that). This is one of those CD's that's fun to listen to once and then ends up collecting dust on the shelf for the rest of your life. I haven't parted with mine but I sure wouldn't recommend it over other William Parker recordings. Try ""Painters Spring"" - that's a fabulous trio recording w/ Drake and Daniel Carter that's not to be missed!"
4,ESCAPE REALITY,"MEDULLA NOCTE have found a formula that works; even if they are still quite young. They have rythmes that are powerful, heavy and sometimes even hardcore. They have opened for groups such as EXTREME NOISE TERROR, STRAPPING YOUNG LAD, MISERY LOVES CO., ENTOMBED, SKINLAB and SOULFLY. To be able to do all that, they need to have a very wide potential and an extreme supply of energy. This album makes you forget all your problems. Pure, violent and rythmed, crank it up and don't think about anything else.Don't forget to check out their upcoming album entitled DYING FROM THE INSIDE coming out in october 2000."
5,Geox shoes,My two year old loves his new shoes. They are great looking shoes and this are the only pair of shoes that my son does not take off within 3 minutes. This is why I rate this shoes with 5 Stars....
2,Meh!,"Works only if you are far away and need to zoom alot. If you are too close, the barrel of the lens is visible in the frame and you have a black circular border effect in your pics. Good for high light and distant shots only. Great for baseball and fottball sideling shots but only when the play is 25-30 feet from the lens."
3,Rashi's Daughters: Female Perspective,"Arthur L. FinkleRashi's Daughters is an important work for many reasons. Rashi, himself, was a philological genius about which the novel relates his sacrifice and the family's sacrifice for his training/teaching. The novel puts a face of this medieval scholar. It also relates the hard times, the many deaths at childbirth, the superstitions and Jewish practices during the European 11th century in Jewish life.The book gives us either gratuitous initial sexual intercourse among the very observant Jews or the genuine article. It all depends on your perspective. It seemd very unusual to be exposed to a sexual aspect of this intellectual family.This writer was looking for the men these daughters married whose children became the Tosafot (Great commentators on Rashi, himeself). It would have been a great incite into the inter-workings of this hard-working family which produced so many scholars, both male and female."

3,not a good chew,"Like other xylitol gum I've tried the flavor was good but the gum was hard and within minutes it was grainy and unpleasant to chew, unlike Trident gum, which is sweetened, at least partly, with xylitol, is good chewing gum and that's the whole point!"
3,There is better gum,I did not care for this gum at all. There is much better gum available. It lost the flavor in just a few minutes.
2,"Not terrible, but not good","This gum is nice and cheap, but it's not really that great. Overall even though it's cheap it's not worth it in my opinion. The flavor is alright but is gone in less than a minute and the gum becomes hard and difficult to chew almost immediately. I also bought the 600ct fruit flavor of this same brand and that was better, the flavor lasted longer and the gum stayed soft for a reasonable length of time."
4,Xylitol Gum Yum,"Enjoyed the cinnamon flavor without all the bad calories. The flavor doesn't last terribly long, but how many gums do? A good value for the price. Will buy again."
2,Pretty awful.,Tiny little pieces of gum that loose their flavor within a couple of minutes. Not a very good cinnamon flavor either.
3,Spry finish,"I love cinnamon gum. It is like dessert to me. I was excited to try some gum made with real cinnamon oil. My other ""go to"" brand has every type of ""tol""(manitol, sorbitol etc.) sweetener made and that scares me just a little. This has a nice peppery, cinnamon flavor to start but only lasts a few minutes. Maybe this is the true cost of a natural flavoring? My ""go to"" brand lasts and lasts but is probably killing me on the inside. The quest for a true cinnamon gum continues."
4,No more upset tummy!,Love the cinnamon flavor of this gum and it actually lasts longer than most gums. I LOVE the fact that it doesn't upset my stomach and make me bloated like regular sugarless gums. I am just reordering my 2nd tub.
3,"Good flavor, but short-lived","I am trying to avoid aspartame in my diet, but most sugar-free gum contains it. This gum uses only Xylitol as the sweetener. It is very strong at first (I purchased cinnamon flavor), but the flavor subsides quickly. If you keep it in your mouth though, you begin to taste it again. Maybe the initial strength deadens the taste buds temporarily. One upside is that it isn't nearly as sticky or soft as other gums, so it doesn't make a mess trying to throw it away. Make sure you keep it away from pets, because Xylitol is toxic for dogs."
2,Am I doing this wrong?,I'm no gum chewing expert but I can't seem to get the flavor to last for more than a few seconds.
1,No flavor,"I was so disappointed with the flavor (or lack thereof) that I threw out the remaining pieces. I only tried a few but I just couldn't love it. The cinnamon flavor wasn't strong at all and after a few minutes I felt like I was just chewing rubber. I like gum to give me a 'fresher' feel and this didn't help at all. I will never order again, no matter the price. My order was a complete waste of money."
2,Made in China,"The gum is OK but I found out that it is made with ingredients from China. No thank you. China has virtually zero health controls over consumable goods. You can get USA made Xylitol gum that uses USA Xylitol called ""Xyla"" from their web site. Just Google them."
2,30 second gum,"It was okay for about 30 seconds then most of the flavor had gone and the gum was hard to chew. It also started to get an off taste. I was hoping it was going to be good, I have tried the mints and there pretty good, different but good. I would agree with another reviewer that it's like chewing on a piece of rubber."
2,"Tastes good, for 10 seconds","I decided to give Spry Cinnamon a chance, reading mostly positives reviews about it. When I first popped a piece in, it tasted great! However, and I am not exaggerating, the flavor was gone in 10 seconds . . . I have never had a gum that the flavor went out so fast in. And like others have said, the gum does turn a little hard and nasty within a minute. I like the idea of it being all natural and helping your teeth, but it's not worth it to me."
2,Titanium Dioxide,"Spry uses Titanium Dioxide to color their gum white, very disappointing. A lot of gum uses this possible carcinogen still I purchased this gum for it's natural properties. I also bought Glee gum which does not have titanium dioxide."
1,"Don't bother, Flavor is gone in 30 seconds...","Intense flavor to begin with, but the flavor disappears within 30 seconds... Don't waste your money. I would have expected this gum to last at least 5 minutes or longer.. but as little time as it did. There is no value in this item."
2,loses flavor very fast,I was disappointed with this product. The flavor is not strong and the gum loses flavor very fast. I will go back to the Epic brand.
2,Not great,"While the flavour of this gum is nice, I agree with other reviewers who say the flavour doesn't last very long. Not only that, but the pieces are quite small, so you have to chew 2 or 3 of them to really get any flavour. Disappointing."
3,Great but...,This gum has a great taste to me and it does freshen your breath but.... the flavor isn't strong and it does not last as long as I would like for the extra cost.
2,bad gum,"Let me just say that I normally don't review things that I buy from amazon, but I felt that it had to be known that this gum is less than spectacular. I chew about a 12-14 count pack of gum a day, but the flavor runs out on this in a mere minutes. I find myself eating 20-40 pieces. If you want xylitol gum, I think you should look for other brands, namely Trident."
1,"hard, flavor losing cubes....","if you like to chew on gum that goes flat within minutes and transforms into a hard flavorless lump, then this gum is for you. It deserves no stars yet this wasn't an option."
1,This is not safe for dogs,"This product is great for people with the caveat you must not let your dogs have even the smallest amount. It can kill them rapidly. It is listed as toxic to dogs and ferrets by the FDA and the ASPCA. Dogs love this for its sweet taste, and will steal it. Keep your pets safe and keep this product out of reach."
3,Fine for a Xyiltol Gum,Fine for a Xyitol gum. Flavor doesn't last very long which seems to be common to the Xyitol Sweetened gums.
5,Gum,I love this gum. Very tasty and no gluten or nasty sugar alcohols. I had to really search for it but it was worth it. I will definitely buy this again.
4,chewing gum,i was pleasantly surprised that one piece was enough for me and the cinnamon taste wasn't real strong. it is also great that this gum doesn't contain aspartame so i am able once again to enjoy chewing gum. the taste seemed to last longer than normal gum.
5,Our favorite gum!,"We do not use artificial sweeteners, and this is the only gum that we chew! It's great for your teeth. The cinnamon is our favorite flavor. The flavor lasts a long time and freshens your breath. It is not exactly like regular gum and will not last as long when compared to the artificial sweeteners in other gums. But there is really no comparison since we don't use these types of gum. My whole family loves it, from my husband and I to our 6 year old and teenager. Our second flavor is peppermint."
1,Great taste.... for about 5 seconds,"I had to post a review of this because the Spry gum is so ridiculous. I thought I was getting a great deal, but I suppose you get what you pay for. I eat two of these every time and the flavor is gone literally within about one minute (that is probably even a bit generous). I would not recommend this gum to anyone. The cinnamon flavor is amazing initially, but, as I said, the flavor lasts so briefly it is not worth it at all. If you are just getting this because you want to chew on something, go ahead and buy this, but don't expect flavor."
3,Chew it for health only.,"Xylitol is supposedly good for your teeth, and that's why I bought this product. Is it actually good for the teeth? I don't know, but it's nice to know I'm actively trying to improve my health.The flavor of this gum is quite good, sweet and cinnamony with a little kick, but it lasts for all of 3 minutes. I don't even know why it says chew for at least 5 minutes on the jar if the flavor lasts for less than that."
5,Perfect fit and connection hold.,Needed to extend my typing area.This product helped greatly.I may one day upgrade to Blue Tooth technology.But this is just enough to stretch my keyboard work space to the coach. I have an extension for my mouse too.
5,I got my desk back!,"Cable (and the companion mouse cable) allows you to convert your ""desktop"" computer to a ""desk side"" computer.You will be amazed (like I was) to discover how big your desk really is!"
4,"Westport, CT in the 70s","Great movie, shows life of a commercial artist in the recession of the early 70s. Scenes of Lepridon Building were actually the World Trade Center under construction. Infamous closing scenes show Brooks Wilson (George Segal), the main character, at the mansion party of an older ad exec, with Wilson's wife (Eva Marie Saint) and mistress at the same party. When the slutty wife of another exec (played by David Doyle) comes on to him, the action goes to a playhouse in the back yard, with disastrous results. Well acted by all."
5,fashionable tie,"Nice paisley tie--looks great with striped shirts. The silk is not of the best quality, but it was inexpensive and on par with other silk ties in this price range. I bought it for my husband for more casual occasions and think it looks pretty sharp."
5,The subtitle is: Photos from the...era,"Ok, the photos are not from New York or L.A.,but the photos strongly evoke another time and how incredibly different newspapers are today. Would any contemporary paper show pictures of suicides or actual crime scenes before the blood had a chance to dry? The book isn't all dark, scenes from everyday life like padgents and contests are shown as well. I give this five stars because I felt i was transported to another time and had a great sense of how people lived, laughed, cried and in many different ways-died."
2,"Good information, but difficult to read","This author has a good following among professional systems engineers. However, this book is torture to read. Mr. Grady's writing is at times convoluted and he uses too many words to make his points. The book layout is circa 1960 style. Long monotonous paragraphs with little to no whitespace furthers the torture of reading. The diagrams are complicated, with no color, and not explained well (and most don't stand on their own).If you can make it through this book, no doubt you will learn something. But why does it have to be such a difficult journey?"
2,Old fashioned book,"This is a really old fashioned book. Seems as not so relevant anymore. It is not an easy-to-read book as it text-burdened, too much theoretical, no enough real life examples and no enough illustrations. In addition, this book is bad edited - too much text, very long sentences, paragraphs and chapters. Most explanations are not clear."
2,Wordy and Impractical,"Thorough: Yes for classical methods, No for modern methodsPractical: NoFirst, my background: I have done requirements analysis before for several projects, but I had never taken a formal course. I took a course to fill in holes and answer questions I had. This book is the required text.Now my review: This book is wordy, theoretical, and goes too much into practices that have in large part been supplanted by modern object-oriented methods. Though there is a small subsection on OO methods, it the majority of the book discusses functional analysis and decomposition. What's worse is that there is little attempt to bridge the two methods together. In my experience, a hybrid method is often preferable than strictly one or the other.Two books I would recommend are Software Requirements by Wiegers and Systems Engineering with SysML/UML by Weilkiens. Applying UML and Patterns by Larman is also an excellent introductory text."
1,this author needs a lesson in concision,"this author obviously doesn't convey a whole lot of confidence in what he has to say because he goes off on wild tangents before he finally gets to the point. Reminds me of a co-worker, she had to explain every single detail out there! Please, I don't want to read his life story, all I care is System Requirements. In addition, his sentences intentionally drag on with lots of passive voice, never knew passive voice could be so annoying! The info is good though, but this book needs a serious fat trimming..."
1,What's with the price?,I'm not sure what the story is with this price--it's about double what a lot of other places are selling these for.
2,Don't buy it,"The image resolution is awful. Since the second day that I got it there is a black shadow on the left side of the image. In addition, the customer service is HORRIBLE, I called them because I was thinking about returning it and they never answered my phone calls.DON'T BUY IT, you will waste your money"
4,Good value,"This is the first webcam I've owned, I use it with the latest Skype which supports video and it works well, though the image is a little jerky. In the ""test"" view the image is perfect, so I think it's something to do with the connection speed/skype settings. I love the ""pipe cleaner"" self supporting connection wire which means no stand or clip are required, keeping the whole thing very travel friendly. For me it was definetly a great value, and of course delivered promptly by Amazon. I would recommend it."
3,Great for Laptop use.,"Saves space in your laptop bag. Image is ok in well lit rooms, but lags slightly in darker settings. I have tested this product with Skype and MSN. Both work equally well."
2,So-So product,"I can't say that I own very many of these things, this was in fact my first venture into USB webcams. I was a bit disappointed in the software that came with it and as many have pointed out, image is decent in well lit areas but not at all acceptable in darker settings. USB is the only cost effective way to go for chat cams were quality isn't critical."
1,A complete waste of my time.,"I purchased this book from Walmart, and needless to say this will be the last book I ever buy online from them ever again. It was extremely boring, and uninformative."
2,Funny guy but racist rants too much,"As a young white male, I'll be the first person to laugh at racial jokes towards white people by black comedians and I've seen and loved most; Murphy, Pryor, Rock, Chappelle, Lawrence etc., Not sensitive to that sort of thing at all, but this was just flat out racist. Griffin is a funny guy, and I find him funny in movies (Deuce Bigalow), but after watching for a while it became obvious he was downright resentful against white people and it showed in his material. Constant unnecessary jabs left and right and it was too over the top. I was too annoyed to finish watching.I'd go with Kevin Hart: Laugh at my Pain. My current favorite standup comedian."
4,"Undercover Brother, Eddie Griffin","Referring to Al Sharpton, Eddie makes it clear from the start, he will continue using the ""N"" and ""B"" word in his repertoire! Because after all ""I'm an artist"". ""Besides"" he says ""they didn't tell Van Gogh not to cut his ear off!"" This is a very funny man, & he is among the majority of comedians who tell jokes about race, politics and sex! He is among the funniest. Besides, these are 3 topics that are prominent in American Society."
4,Gift for Hubby,"I've been trying to collect all stand up dvds of all of my husband's favorite comedians. He loves this one in particular. Although I am not a big Eddie Griffin fan, I did find this one to be funny. Eddie is direct and blunt...lots of profanity so if you're not a fan of that then this is definitely not for you. Eddie fans, you will love this!"
2,Get what you pay for,"Good for practicing on soft targets. I am an accomplished bo shuriken thrower and these actually bent in 2"" cardboard. Fine for practice though."
3,great for recreational enjoyment,"These are a lot of fun to throw at a cardboard box, but start from close in cause every miss is a bent and useless dart. Some claim a bent dart is easy to fix because you bed it back into place, but bend it back to TRUE?!? I don't think so, every time you throw a dart that is slightly bent, what ever you are doing, it isn't improving your skill. These should not be used for self defense under any circumstances. There are throwing spikes perfect for self defense, but you ain't getting em cheaper then 20 bucks a piece. But these look cool and they are a fun and inexpensive way to pass the time-hence the title 8)"
3,GREAT BUT.....,"Great dart points but I would recommend a few things prior to one using these. Those are:1) Wrap and/or glue a Bright Tassel with say a feather on the end of each dart or2) Paint each dart with florescent and/or phosphorescent paintPrior to use, if you are going to use them out doors. These are VERY EASILY LOST outdoors without any high light added."
3,Good Thoughts but too scattered,"The author has a lot of good things to say. That's a positive and negative. He is certainly a wide reader and he includes in his discussion issues of biology, chemistry, cultural analysis, sociology, neuro-science etc. However, it strikes this reader as just skimming across the top of these issues and not going deeper. I had a hard time seeing how the rabbit trail conversations significantly related to the issue at hand ie idolatry.On a positive note: There are group discussion questions and the book is interesting enough to be readable. This could be a good supplement to a Bible Study on the 10 commands."
3,Microwave Mind Control DOES exist,"Although I am a tad sceptical of anyone with alleged CIA connections writing a book and claiming the truth...not because of conspiracy theories, more like because insiders on this stuff split the truth so much I often wonder if they remember what the truth really is.If you don't believe in Microwaves being used for Mind Control I would advise you to check this out, a letter drom the DOD to one Sharon Shea: http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/dod-ltr.htmor you can try this:http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/frey.htmEnjoy"
1,Only Two Reasonable Options,"I own this book because I am a lifelong student, not of UFO's, but of people who believe in UFO's. Whereas many books on this topic represent genuine attempts by serious people to come to grips with a phenomenon they do not understand; this ""book"" is comprised either of the ravings of a lunatic, or, a sad attempt to profit from both the gullability of the foolish and the fears of the delusional. There can be only these two options. In either case, if you are seriously considering buying it, I beg you to save your money."
1,Hmmm.,Commander X is like so right dude. One time after taking bong hits my dog told me to look out of the window and sure enough Brown people were floating outside in the air. The next morning I felt pretty groggy and later found out that our septic tank had exploded. Weird.
5,Direct replacment,I managed to misplace the switch key when I moved one of my shops a few months ago. This is a direct replacment that fit perfectly in a 1301 Ryobi.
4,"A good, in-depth look in to the creation of Beauty and the Beast.","Beauty and the Beast is my absolute favorite traditionally animated film by Disney. This book to me was very good at going in deep in to the creation of Beauty and the Beast, using the factors used in making an animated film; from the script, to the voice actors, to the design of the characters and the backgrounds, and the animators. The book also has a decent amount of concept art, model sheets, photos of the staff and voice actors, as well as production shots. There are a few downsides though; the book is a little too short for me (88 pages), and compared to other Disney ""Art Of"" books, I wish there was a bit more concept art over production stills. But overall, if you are a fan of Classic Disney or art/making of books, this book is definitely worth checking out for yourself."
2,Incompentent and indifferent tech support is indefensible.,"It is one thing to have various problems with a computer, but another to have incompetent and indifferent tech support.I had my 1200 Compaq for 3months. First I had problems with the sound drivers, then I had problems with windows ME program and finally with the hard drive.When the hard drive totally crashed (only 3 months old) I spent almost two hours trying to get help from technical support. 4 individuals (one brain dead, one total indifferent, one telling my that my year warranty did not include the hard drive and one that disconnected me,) the last tech told me to send it back and it would be two weeks before I would get the machine back. Two weeks for a person that works on the road is untenable."
5,amazing results from simple instructions!,"Too bad I had to find this author after his demise. Mr. Hewitt has simple yet profound suggestions to engage our higher consciousness. I am revealing miracles in my lifeto my amazement! Too often we blame others or situations that have happened to us for our own feelings of not achieving all that we think we should in our lives. With these written words we have no excuses to get on track to be the best we can be for ourselves. I are blessed to have found these books written by Mr. Hewitt, read all of his books is my suggestion!"
2,"Annoy friends and family,discipline unruly children","Dealing with uninvited guests?Trying to drive out annoying relatives?Need help disciplining children?Do you wear a purity ring&want; to keep from getting ""in the mood"" with your honey? Then this Rough Guide is PERFECT for you,serving these many purposes!It opens with a ""Yodeling Lesson"" that will quiet any child--with boredom.""Yodeling Addiction"" is a perfect reason for checking into rehab (with other celebrities).There's yodeling with a European club beat in ""Jaga Ode"",and the experimental yodels of ""Haiku Lingo"" and ""Yodeling Robot"" (about a robot enamored of Dolly Parton).You wouldn't want to be invited to an ""Inuit Wedding"",but you can understand how yodeling leads to a ""Pygmy Divorce.""This album is also a virtual ""Small World"" with yodels from Mexico,the Alps,India--and even country western Hawaiian yodeling-and all are annoying.I'm surprised this album hasn't made it onto Jim Nader's ""Annoying Music Show."" It would be vindication if it did."
2,Title misleading,"Nice small book , easy to read. But not much in there in regard to actual rituals. Lots of the usual info on the Loa's that is in almost any books on the subject. A brief tid bits on doing the usual spells; love, revenge, job... Invocations and much of the herb info is not in english. Some of the Herb items are not to be found in many city areasw. Most folks doing any magical workings will prefer to use their everyday language.There are better books out there. Keep looking."
3,Well written and researched with a plausible plotline...,"I have to admit Franklet's handling of techno-babble is very good, but I got tired of reading a mini-biography about every character he introduced. Why does every new author think that we need tons of biographical facts for every character? Show, don't tell. Also, I think there was too much technical info, and even though it was well done, not every reader cares how a network works. The book was a bit long, but I had a hard time putting it down. This book is much better than 'Ulterior Motives' which some reviewers had recommended and I thought stunk. A very good first effort, and I look forward to more."
4,Not bad for an airplane ride,"Lots of familiar characterization of people & places and situations. Although it's not literature, it was a fun, lightweight diversion for a long airplane ride."
1,Too long. Too much detail. No suspense. ZZZZ,"Bad Memory is about Simtec (like Dell); big co. selling network cards and PCs, etc, and a hacker, hektor (spelled w a K, yeah cheesy I know) comes in and goes throug their inventory database and mixes up the orders.So a client gets the wrong PCs delivered from Simtec and shoots himself. It's stretching credibility a bit. i mean 'excuse me but we're talking wrongly delivered PCs here ok. So the guy's a little loony we're told but still... And this comes in the first 10 pages and supposed to set the pace for the rest of the book.I flipped through looking for good bits, but there little suspense or tension to recommend this.No doubt the guy's really into the technical stuff but still prety amateurish to computer literate readers; I mean using Netwrok batch commands to mess up Simtec's system? :-)No didnt buy the book. Got it from the library."
1,Makes one wish their memory was bad,Bad Memory was a bad book. I regret that I wasted hours of my life trying to read this tripe.
1,"""Does not in general affect the water's pH""","Or, ""In rare cases, this product may negatively impact your water's pH""This product will remove ammonia quite effectively. And screw your pH if you're one of the lucky few like me. Every time I've ever used this product, it has caused my tank pH to plummet well below 6.0. I've lost 1 fish to this product. Never. Again. My water chemistry is completely incompatible with Kordon Amquel Plus.If you've never used this product before, I highly recommend that you do frequent pH tests after administering it to your aquarium & have a back-up plan (another tank, water conditioned by other means, pH buffers, etc) in case things go horribly, horribly wrong."
1,Sometimes kills my fish,"While I've used this successfully for quite a while, under some conditions it kills my fish. Suspected it once when all my shrimp died shortly after using it. Stopped using it after that, but unfortunately didn't throw it out. Yesterday changed the water in two pleco tanks and didn't have my usual Novaqua, so I used the Amquel Plus. Big mistake, all the plecos in one tank died within hours, and half of those in the other tank are dead too. So the only common item in the three deaths is using the Amquel. Don't know if it went bad or something, it really stank and the tank water still stinks. So I just don't trust it any more."
1,Amquel Plus,"It was probably my fault, but I killed all my fish with this stuff. Apparently I put too much in. The big labels say 'safe for fish' but the details due warn not to over use. Proceed carefully."
4,"Amazing functions, really easy to operate","I used this camera for family photos and obtained really good results, the camera combined with the software provided produced good quality photos, excellent on-screen presentation and great prints."
3,Its ok,The camera is ok but the problem is it is not effective in night. One bad feature of this camera is that if it is switched off the last settings are not saved. The default settings are restored and this becomes very irritating at times as one has to keep doing this exercise again and again. My camera lens has anyway spoiled as a small dark spot is seen in the middle of each photo.Well I would not recommend HP cameras to anyone. In my opinion Sony Cybershot is authentic. Nothing can beat Cybershot!
3,Not enough Dat Phan on the DVD,"Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Dat Phan. I was super excited when I noticed that he had a DVD coming out. About time right??? Now I also noticed that they stuck a 30 minute Chris Clobber video into this DVD. And yes I was aware of Chris Clobber's presence when I bought this dvd. So it's not really 85 minutes of Dat Phan but only 55 minutes. I gave Chris Clobber a try and I played through all 30 minutes of it but he was just not funny at all. Chris and Dat are two totally different comedians and Chris really didn't make me laugh at all. This is supposed to be a DAT PHAN dvd, not Chris Clobber. If they wanted to jam more content into this dvd, they really should have replaced Chris Clobber with Dat Phan's Comedy Central Performance. I think that would make more sense, so that's why I gave this three stars instead of a full five."
2,Not all that funny,"Dat Phan told a lot of the same jokes in this DVD as he did on Comedy Central presents stand up. So, it was kind of like watching that over again with some new jokes thrown in. Kind of upset that I bought the DVD."
1,shoddy science part 2,"Like his book DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME, Sheldrake fails to completely exclude variables that may contaminate his results. Were he a psychologist and not a biologist, he might have a better understanding of the many psychological factors that could affect his research. Why he chose this aspect of parapsychology as a subject of study I can't imagine, because as proof it is much less convincing than anything done by Rhine and other researchers. Until someone can identify the area of the brain which deals with psychic powers and the medium through which it travels, parapsychology will always remain the unwanted stepchild of science."
1,A more useful endeavor?,Wouldn't it be more useful for Sheldrake to figure out why having a seven-year-old stare at you quietly while you sleep is likely to wake you up within one minute?
2,"Muddy, sparse content, more questions than answers","The topic, the title, and the packaging of the book is intriguing. The author does a fair job of getting the reader more interested in the subject - he cites many studies, immediately offers critiques, and suggests further experiments and areas of inquiry. However, I thought the book was quite sparse in any concrete answers (yes, I realize there aren't many), and where interesting findings were cited, they were often hidden under pages and pages of quite obvious undocumented observations. Throughout the book, the author refers to future chapters that will answer one question or the other, but no actual answers or rigorously presented findings ever appear. The book was a bit of a disapointment for me, but it did get me more interested in the subject. I'm looking forward to finding a better presented treatment of the subject."
3,Too bad,"This book came out an ornithologists trip throughly largely unexplored NW brazil in the 1940's. The purpose of the mission was to establish an air base and ""modernize"" the interior of Brazil. Luckily for us Helmut sick went along for the trek.Unfortunately, it's too bad someone so skilled in ornithology isn't a little more skilled with people. While his exuberance concerning birds shows plainly, he has apparently never been schooled in anthropology. He only vaguely seems aware of the damage he's doing to the natives way of life by trading tools with them and giving them more modern implements. I understand the events in this book occurred in the 1940's but still.Great work on birds. Bad work on people."
4,Improves your focus,"This product gives me the boost you need to get through those busy days of working non-stop on brain tasking issues, math, science, SW engineering. You just feel better when the day is done by not being so drained and being able to focus for hours on end."
3,Hard Day Ahead? Take This,"This works just as it says, as a supplement. Work out, eat right, get 6 hours of sleep a night, don't let stress eat at you, you don't curse out the lady who cut you off, and basically you'll be okay. This supplements those days where you need that extra edge. That's it.Read the amount of vitamins you'll be ingesting and the % of daily calue is absurd if you take 4 tablespoons of this stuff. Unless you workout several hours a day, a professional bike courier, or pole dance for a living there's no way you'll work through this many vitamins: you'll simply piss it away or the vitamins will harm you."
4,Go Team,"Perfect for the season we had. It was much larger than I expected, but my kids were excited when they opened it. It looks good on the tree."
3,Specific Unit for a Specific Use,"Given the particular enclosure needs of some computer cases, this power supply was designed to meet that specific need, and nothing more. Average power output and conditioning is provided. This model was obviously designed to fit a particular desktop case design, if you note the tapered opening by the exhaust fan.There are other power supplies very close to this ""narrow ATX"" specification, but this one is the only one that has the extra-narrow rear to fit some cases. I made the mistake of buying one of those other power supplies, only to find it was 1/8"" wider at the rear end, making it impossible to fit it into the case enclosure.Please make sure you carefully examine the rear portion of your enclosure and the rear part of your ""old"" power supply to make sure you are looking at a ""standard box"" shape or a ""narrower exhaust"" design before ordering."
5,Wonderful post-partum relief from tearing,I used this during my recovery from the birth of my son. This was provided to me in the hospital to provide topical relief for my tearing/stiches. This ointment really did provide much need pain relief.
2,Not the best choice,This product eventually relieved the pain but it is not as fast acting or as effective as Nupercainal. And it doesn't do anything to reduce swelling.
1,Not the originals,"European mix? That right there should be the tip-off (if you didn't happen to see the advanced-age picture of the guys on the cd cover) that someone fiddled with these. In fact, none of the songs appears to be an original recording. These are remakes, and if you have fallen in love with the originals (Lion Sleeps Tonight and Portrait Of My Love were their big ones), these pale in comparison."
5,pleased,A much better price than what I can purchase at the Health Food store . I like the savings .
4,Works!! takes time....,"I bought Biosil in Jan and didn't take it religiously until beginning of Feb. The cricket-y feeling in my knee (years of track) has all but disappeared. In addition, my nails are stronger now, even though the older portion of my nail is still breaking, the nail bed is clear and strong. My hair is also improving as well. My hair doesn't particularly grow faster, but it does grow thicker. I will definitely make sure I use it twice a day instead of once a day. Worth every penny!"
5,Amazing Eyelashes!!!,"Have used BioSil for about a month now. Followed other recommendations and have doubled the dose. I also am taking a Biotin supplement. I have noticed fewer hairs lost in the shower and in my brush, but the real difference is in my eyelashes. They are AMAZING!!! I have ordered two more bottles of the BioSil liquid."
3,Biosil,"Used this for 3 months and seemed to be working, but then I was not using it for about 3 weeks and the effect stopped. May work better for others."
4,nails improved,"I received Biosil promptly and in good order. Within a few weeks of using this, I noticed that my nails were definitely stronger. My nails had been chipping very easily. That is no longer the case, and they are also less ridgy. I have used it for several months now, and will most certainly stick with Biosil. My hair also has improved, but because that is less noticeable, I gave the product four stars rather than five."
5,helpful,"I use this daily, adding it to water or juice. It helps my nails, skin and joints. So easy to use!"
5,Just wow~!,"I purchased Biosil Liquid Silicon and started taking it about 3 1/2 weeks ago. I bought it to improve my hair and haven't seen a significant change .. as yet but what I have noticed is a huge change in my nails! I had a lot of Beau's lines on my nails especially my thumbnails (indicative of a vitamin deficiency) and I just noticed the Beau's lines are GONE! I would've thought they would've disappeared with new growth but not the case. I am amazed really, something totally unexpected and needless to say I'm quite happy! Hopefully I'll see similar results with my hair! I definitely will be reordering! :)"
1,NOT LIQUID NOT 30 ML,"The description says it is Natrol Brand 30 ML LIQUID Biosil. What you get is Natural Products 30 CAPSULES of Biosil GRANULES. If I had wanted capsules I would have ordered capsules as there are many capsules out there. I specifically chose this because 30ML LIQUID is more than 1 oz LIQUID which is what the other (and true Natrol brand) offered for a slightly higher price). Well now I know why. I certainly didn't get the product I ordered and it's certainly NOT LIQUID. Nothing Liquid about it. Doesn't weigh 30 ML either. Will never buy from this seller again, even though they are fulfilled by Amazon and I will go to their store and review them poorly too. I hate false advertising."
5,Definitely a keeper,I love this product. My nails are harder and since they're not breaking off they've grown to longer lengths. My hair is growing in really this and my doctor says he's seen definite improvement with my bone's density since my car accident. I'm re-buying once this is empty.
4,It smells like fish,"I can't comment on its effectiveness, but if you're deciding on this or the gel caps, know that his smells like fish. But when I mix it with vegetable juice, I don't taste or smell it at all. I would buy this again because I take a lot of supplements and don't want to consume so many gel caps and fillers. By the way, I tried putting a little on my skin and it was real uncomfortable, kind of sticky and greasy. And smelled like fish. Not yummy fish, either. Icky fish."
4,A veteran BioSil taker,"I've been taking BioSil in pill form for years now. I thought I'd try the liquid form to see the difference. Unfortunately, the taste is too horrible to bear, so it's hard to give a fair review. It smells like rotten fish and tastes like a pound of salt was placed on your tongue. Yuck! However, I'm sure it works if I was man enough to take it more consistently."
5,Love this item,"This is a terrific product! Since I started using it my hair is healthier and thicker and my nails no longer chip, split and break. This is a great product at a very good price!"
1,Pay and receive nothing!,Thought I was buying something to help grow more hair but instead I lost hair when I found I paid for something and did not get it. Wrote and said it did not arrive and got no return answer.
2,Nasty Taste,"I used to buy the liquid Biosil, but couldn't handle the taste @ all, even with orange juice..and was wondering what it was doing to my teeth? Anyway, I opted to try out the pill version. I am kind of unsure of how and if this stuff works or not. It states on the bottle it's manufactured in Belgium?!?! I wonder if it's legit stuff or not."
5,Pleasant Surprise,"This book was recommended by a friend who knew that I had a history of lucid dreaming; otherwise, I never would have read a book with such a title. If you have ever been fortunate/unfortunate enough to share in the experience of lucid dreams, then you owe it to yourself to read this book. Although I am not a believer in Sorcery, nor a fan of Castaneda, I found this book to be very insightful, and actually helpful in many ways. The author clearly is a gifted communicator. Anyone who overcomes great adversity in life, and makes the effort (and takes the risk) to share this experience for the benefit of others, receives my full support and my appreciation."
4,Competent but not Enlightened,"Little more needs to be said than has been said by the many other reviewers. I came to the CD enthralled with Yundi Li through his recordings of Chopin and Liszt. I was especially eager to hear what he would do with Schumann's Carnaval.I was a bit disappointed. I believe there is more to this music than Yundi Li mines. His Scarlatti and Mozart are also well played but not memorable. There is much more that could have been communicated with the Mozart that Yundi Li did not find.The title ""Vienna Recital"" led me to believe that this was a live recording of a recital given in Vienna, but there is no applause and no indication of this being a live performance. I was a little surprised by that.Taken together, I was pleased to see that Yundi Li is branching out beyond his limited repertoire of Chopin and Liszt, but he has yet to bring to his new repertoire what he has so admirably accomplished with his earlier choices."
1,stone broke in mail,the stone broke in shipping and we got the board wet and it warped terribly. It might have been fine otherwise.
5,Truly soothing,"It's so great that I stocked up on it. I love it and use it when I shower at bed time, it puts me right to sleep. What a great scent. It's almost unbelievable!!!"
1,Another Faulty Listing,"This item is either the ""Live 1990"" compact disc, or the DVD of the same show (Bedrock on BBC4, recorded at Nottingham 30 March 1990) which was FINALLY released in 2001.This is lovely stuff, but not separate from the above listings."
1,Enamel chips,"This pot came out of the box with large pieces of the enamel chipping off, both inside and outside the pot. No longer safe for cooking and I haven't used it yet."
4,"Thin and tinny, but holds a lot of wort","I got this for brewing full 5 gallon batches of beer. It works well for that, being about the biggest post I could reliably fit on my stove. Being a bit wide rather than super tall, it's a little easier to work under the stove hood for stirring, etc. But if you fill this thing up, prepare for a hernia if you try to move it around. You're talking about 50 pounds or more, here."
1,Damaged,ordered original came -damaged-porcelin chipped=returned second one inside large chip-went to Macys and found perfect products-must be damaged in handling-pass on this item
2,Not made in USA as had been advertised!,"Very disappointed! Unfortunately, this pot was manufactured in Mexico, not in the USA as had been shown online when I ordered it, so I retured it. I ended up buying a Nordic Ware 20 Qt stock pot instead. Nordic Ware ARE still made in USA - in Minnesota I think. Keep America working and get American's that are out of work back to work!"
5,Very Good..,I have found this to be an excellent product and does what is advertised. I'm very pleased with this purchase and have bought it again and will continue to use it.
4,A must have,"For any new chaos mage, this book is a must have, and is a pre-requisit to the even better Liber Kaos. Carrol staes his case simply and effectivly however the book is also contradictory in places... although thinking about it isnt that the nature of Choas? Read and be enlightend but remember to keep your own opinion about you though, you'll find that isnt to easy."
3,Mainly for IOT students,"This is a double feature of two books that are an introduction to chaos magic. The author deals here with various magical techniques and magical philosophy. Unfortunately I had the impression that the book is a printed version of two scripts that were written mainly for students of the IOT (Illuminates of Thanateros). Most of the theoretical statements are only relevant against this background. During big parts the book is too superficial to be a real help for magical studies, and for general newcomers the informations are too specific. So I definitely would recommend this book for students of the IOT, but for people who are interested generally in magic or in another magical tradition it is possibly not satisfying."
5,My favorite book,"Ok, really, this book is a complete must-have. I have owned it for almost a year, and still refer to it on a near-daily basis and can always manage to learn something from it, even though I've read it several times through! Carroll does slip up in a few spaces, ie: his description of sigils is less than par, and I probably wouldn't have understood it at all were it not for my very thorough, previous understanding of sigils, and his description of the Mass of Chaos took me a few read-throughs to understand, but overall this book is near perfect. There are so many lines from the Liber NOX chapter that I absoloutly loved it's not even funny. I'd buy Liber NOX alone for that price!!"
5,Cuts to the meat of magick,"Clear, methodical and believable. It stays on tangent, rips alot of truth out of the murk of superstition and places it on the table before you. The perfect book for someone trying to comprehend themselves. A book for those who have had a glimpse of what's really going on... A beautiful mix, after years of research the first book that I can suggest without reservation... Also very complimetary to discordian outlooks."
5,"Exceptional, Logical, Forbidden","Whenever I decide to open a dark portal to the acausal nether space where magic happens, I refer to this book.It is an Opus of how to explore magic and the psychie without limitation. Of course, it's not for everyone. It's just for those who are independent, brave and curious. It's for people who don't want to be limited by only one tiny belief system so it will frighten most people away.Nonetheless, I love it.Dantalion JonesAuthor of Lots of Books On Mind Control"
3,"try elsewhere, first","Peter Carroll has some interesting ideas, but they are mostly poorly-written regurgitations of what Crowley and A.O. Spare already said before he came to the table. I would recommend starting with source material if you want an understanding of those two. Israel Regardie and Lon Milo DuQuette both write some more accessible interpretations of Crowley if you don't want to wade through lengthy pontifications.If you want a good introduction to Chaos Magick and to see some unique ideas, I highly recommend getting Phil Hine's ""Condensed Chaos"" (also available here on Amazon). His writing is excellent, and he does a much better job of clearly presenting the basics of Chaos Magick with a pragmatic attitude.Carroll is interesting from a historical perspective since he was one of the early Chaos Magicians, so this is probably worth having for the completist."
2,disturbing,"This cd is really short but it's still too long. Once it gets inside your head you will need extraordinary measures to remove it. I preferred the shock therapy though it left me with a metallic aftertaste. Just because it is a terrifically awful album, doesnt mean it doesnt have value. You will have hours of amusement terrorizing you neighbors and friends. ""LINUS bomp bomp bomp, LINUS... "" I think i will try a exorcism this time."
3,Anxious to try this out...colour a bit faded,I received the BabyBjorn Carrier in about three or so weeks. I was anxious to try it out but will have to wait a few more months to try when I am due. I liked the fact that there was a detailed booklet with the carrier.However I thought the colour could have been brighter as the material looked as though it was sitting in a warehouse for a little while. I would like to believe that this will have nothing to do with how the product works as the assembly points look quite sturdy and I did fit it together to see the ease with which the product would set up and come apart. It looks like it will give good support and my husband likes the fit as well.So all in all I am not disappointed.I just wish what you see online is exactly what you get...colour and all.
2,Not for big babies.,We bought one thinking it'd be great to have for our 9 week old baby. He's approximately 15lbs and we could barely squeeze him into the carrier. They may rate it up to 25lbs but there's no frickin' way that's happening in this life time. Buy it for less than 10lb kiddos and you might be OK.
4,"My baby's favorite, but didn't last until 22 pounds","My baby loved this the most out of all the 7 baby carriers I bought, but she outgrew it before she hit 22 pounds, like it said it went to. She started to get very squished in there before we hit that mark. She always wanted to be facing outward, and the Baby Bjorn is the only carrier that does that. It feels very secure, and the padding makes me feel that my baby is comfortable. It does start to hurt your back and shoulders because there isn't any support, but seeing as it doesn't carry a baby very heavy, it is OK for shorter trips. My baby fell asleep very easily in this carrier- every time I put her in it. It's extremely easy to buckle and unbuckle- I LOVE that feature. I just wish they made it for bigger babies!"
2,least favorite carrier....,I was given a babybjorn with my first child and out the 4 other carries I have this is by far my least favorite. The material is rough and it does not evenly distribute the babies weight. Get an ergo or moby if you plan on wearing your baby a lot.
5,Love it!!,"Ive had my baby bjorn for about 9 months and i love it! Its easily adjustable and does not take forever to do so. Its a little hard to figure out when you first start using it, but you will catch on quick. This helps so much, it allows me to carry baby and hold on to my toddler. :)"
5,Really great!,"It is extremely comfortable and feels very safe. Our baby loved it from the beginning, first towards the inside (he would sleep no problem) and then towards the outside (he loved to be able to see everything). We used until he was 10 months (~8.5 Kg). We love it so much that now it's one of our favorite babyshower gifts for our friends."
3,"Great for newborn, not so great for heavy baby",During the first 3 months my husband and I loved our Bjorn. It was so easy to put on and our newborn was very comfy in it. When she got to be about 12 lbs though it started to kill my back (though my husband still liked it). When she reached 15 lbs I ditched the Bjorn and went for the Ergo because I needed the hip support. Bottom line: this is a good carrier but don't expect it to be the only one you'll ever need!
3,Nice but have pressure points,"I have enjoyed this baby carrier. It's simple, comfy, warm, and safe. The only problem is that it has a major pressure point on one of the shoulders after about 5 or 10 minutes of wearing. I have adjusted and readjusted several times, but it's really difficult to get even. I have a headache after about 30 minutes. I know that many don't have this problem, but getting the pressure even is sooo difficult for me. The heavier my baby gets the more difficult it is to get right. I would recommend looking at the Moby Wrap. Both of my sisters use one and they LOVE IT! I have enjoyed this carrier, but I definitely get frustrated with adjusting the straps. Good luck on your hunt for the perfect carrier!"
2,Not for XL parent,"I am 5""9 (182 cm) and 220 lbs (100 kg) and this carrier is way to small for me, it fits my petite wife very well but with my build junior has it's face wright in my face ;)"
3,Wish it was more comfortable,"We bought the baby bjorn in hopes that it would be simpler/faster to use than our ""ultimate baby wrap"". Positives are that it is easy to put on/put baby into (especially with a second set of hands), can be worn OVER a thick winter coat (difficult with a wrap-style carrier), and seems quite well-made and secure and comfy for the baby. Also looks more masculine for dad to wear than a wrap/sling. Negatives are that it is offers very little support for the wearer and is MUCH more uncomfortable than our baby wrap. Our daughter is only 11 lbs. I can't imagine the back pain I'll have when she is bigger! We have since gone back to using our baby wrap- which just takes a bit more practice to get the hang of. Not sure why these things are SO popular..."
2,Not necessary,"This is one of those items I thought was a must have when having our first child. We hardly use it. Yes, we do find it nice to have at times, but for the price and amount of use we've gotten out of it borrow one if you can or find something less expensive to use. This is a difficult item to review or buy because you really can't know what your needs will be until you have your first child. All of the positive reviews are nice, but you may not be as avid a user as they all are."
2,There are better carriers out there!!!,"In the Baby Bjorn carrier your baby hangs by his/her crotch; this cannot be good for the childs spine! It is also uncomfortable for the parent as the child's weight is not well distributed and tugs down on the shoulders. We much prefer the ergo baby carrier; its lightweight and the child sits rather than hangs in the carrier. It can also be worn on the hip and the back, can be used until the child is 40 lbs, and comes in a wide variety of colors and styles. With my baby in this carrier her weight is distributed across my hips rather than from my shoulders and I can wear her for longer periods of time because we are both more comfortable. I wouldn't recommend the baby bjorn, the only thing it was good for was helping me get an initial feel for how much I would like to wear our baby."
2,Not for tall parents....,"Everyone I know raved about this product, told me I had to have it and would love it. Every time I used the BabyBjorn my baby cried and she doesn't cry about much. Added to that my husband who is 6'8 cannot wear it--the straps are too short. We ended up using a sling. If your husband is tall--try it on in a store before you buy."
4,Highly Recommended to me,"I haven't actually used the Baby Bjorn carrier but it has been highly recommended to me. I was going to buy a cheaper baby carrier, but after reading other reviews on the internet and talking to people who have this carrier, I decided to pay the little extra to get a good quality product. I found that Amazon was the cheapest place to purchase this carrier ($60)."
2,Nice carrier,"The baby bjorn is a nice carrier. I received one for my baby shower. However, I hardly used it. I thought I would use it a lot but I found I hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much. Before that, the many straps made me afraid I was going to drop the baby. But probably the same problem for other carriers. I was really surprised by how little I used it, since I really wanted to carry my baby"
5,love it ...must buy,this is a must buy for al the mommies ..yes it is expensive but it beats all the comparison ...its way more comfortable and sturdy than any of its competitors ... i loved it...
2,Bad for your back but....,My son is 4 month old and weighs 20 lbs. This carrier is not meant for us as he is too heavy and my shoulders suffer from carrying him...i recommend however the BABYBJÖRN Organic Comfort Carrier with the waist support for bigger kids!
5,Every parent should have one!!,I absolutely love my Bjorn!! It's especially nice when I have to do things around the house and my baby wants to be close to me.
2,Inconvenient to use,"I guess I can understand why some people like this carrier. Once you have the baby in it, it is comfortable to wear. However, if you are taking the baby out and putting him back in repeatedly (say, for example, while running errands) for short periods of time, you will get sick of it quickly. It is not easy to balance a baby, especially a larger baby, while attaching the sliders and buttons. I also got uncomfortably hot wearing this carrier, which is padded and almost feels insulated, holding the baby's body heat against me. Furthermore, my baby was unhappy in it, but that is primarily because he never liked being confined in any way.To sum up:This is a good carrier to wear with a small baby, for extended periods of wear, in cool weather.This is not a good carrier to wear running errands or for short periods of time, for a larger baby, or in warm climates.If your baby hates confinement like my son did, you probably won't find any baby carrier satisfactory."
1,Terrible on my Back!,"I tried using this carrier with my 3 month old neice. It was fairly easy to get her in and out of, and she seemed to enjoy it, BUT after only wearing it for only 15 minutes it was absolutely killing my back and shoulders! I am a small person, 5 ft tall, 130lbs, and have never had back problems before. I had heard from other people that the Bjorn carrier is the ""best"", so I was very dissapointed that it was so uncomfortable for me. I am now pregnant, and decided NOT to purchase a Bjorn to use for my baby. In searching for a better carrier, I discovered a hand made carrier called the Mei Tai which is supposed to be much more comfotable, and much less expensive! If you are looking into the Bjorn, please look do a bit of research b/c there are Many other carriers out there.~Kim"
2,very disappointed!,I was so excited to get this carrier but when it arrived and I tried it on and put my baby in it she hated it! It didn't seem to fit her little legs right..they were spread out and she seemed so uncomfy....she freaked out every time I put her in it...also I think this is made to fit a smaller person...I'm a curvy woman and it was so unconfy in my chest.
5,Awsome,"5 stars becasue i felt it was worth the price And it was ""moldable"" to how i wanted to hide the straps or fit it to me ..or whatever u know ?i can do more with it then what they show on line. and it costed mroe aT TARGET! but i was mad when i saw ROSS had a cute carrier as well for way way less...."
1,Waste of Money - get the ErgoBaby!,"This is the 3rd type of carrier that I've bought - I was really happy with it until my daughter got to be over 10 lbs. She's 6 months old, 13 lbs. (which is really small for her age) and it gave me severe back pain to carry her less than 1 mile. The ErgoBaby is designed to spread the weight evenly and I'm now going to spend another fortune for the Ergo. Advice to all expecting parents: DO NOT get the Bjorn. Get a Moby or other wrap for the newborn and then get the Ergo."
1,There are better options than the bjorn,"I used the bjorn A LOT before I knew there were better options. The bjorn is only comfortable for carrying babies under about 15lbs for short periods of time. I didn't feel like my baby was secure in this carrier. The bjorn is not comfortable or safe for babies as it puts the baby in an unnatural position by placing all of their weight on their spine. There are better options available (wraps, ring slings, becos, ergos, etc.) that are more comfortable and safe for baby."
1,The Back Breaker,"My baby loves it, but my back does not. It puts all of the baby's weight on a muscle between my shoulder blades (no matter how many different ways I adjust the straps)...it feels nothing like being pregnant because my back did not bother me at all then, even though I gained 40 lbs. If I wear my baby in the Bjorn for even an hour during the day, my back will throb when I lay down at night and I will have to sit and lie down for the next several days to recover. I am petite and had a 9 lb. baby, so I thought I just needed to get my muscles used to her weight, but my husband is very strong and muscular and the Bjorn does the exact same thing to his back. People rave about this carrier and it is the most stylish carrier on the market, but I don't recommend this item at all and will never put it on again."
2,Hurts my back and shoulders,"I bought this carrier before I knew about all the other carriers available. I found it to be quite easy to use however, the weight of the baby is being distributed in such a way that within 20 minutes of wearing it my back and shoulders hurt terribly.I was then educated about the many other choices of baby carriers. The one that worked best for me was the Ergo. Not only does it distribute the weight of the baby in such a way that I don't even notice that I am carrying 17 pounds of baby on my chest, but the weight and height maximums are far greater than the Bjorn, therefore making the life of the product far longer. And, the Ergo has a handy pocket that has enough room to store several diapers, cream, wipes, etc. so the need of a diaper bag is obsolete. I LOVE my Ergo."
2,Definitely Not Ergonomic,"We got the organic version of this. Thought it was a great price and heard a lot about the B Bjorns. However, it's not comfortable. The Active version might be; it seems to have more back support, but the original is not. The material is nice, but the design just isn't good for long stints (only good for about half an hour). I also don't advise it for newborns - the baby just kind of hangs there. Something that would support your baby more would be better, like the Ergo or theBoba."
3,So far so good,Me and my wife have a 3 month old that has to be held. We have enjoyed having this product and put it to good use. So far we haven't had any problems with the design but like I said our child is only 3 months and doesn't weigh much. It will be interesting to see if it will still be as useful in the months to come. So far we are satisfied with the product and plan on continuing to use it.
5,My baby LOVES his carrier!,My baby loves to be all snuggled up close and nap in his carrier while I get house chores done with my free hands! Its excellent! I thought about buying this for about 2 weeks before I actually bought it& I wish I had hit the 'checkout' button earlier!
5,Wonderful!,"Comfortable, convenient, easy to use. This is the only way I can grocery shop as my daughter loves it! It was the best present to myself."
3,okay,cant really review this item was given as a gift. didn't hear any complaints. don't know if incentives were given for this item
4,Great carrier!,I would definitely recommend this carrier. It's easy to use & comfortable for babies. My daughter loves it! Makes things easier to get things done around the house & it's nice to get out without having to bring around a bulky stroller.
5,Keeps my child content,"We used this carrier during a cross-country flight with one layover and it worked wonders. Much easier than using and checking a stroller. Our 18-pound 6 month old was very content to be carried by my husband- no fussing, whining or kicking. Carrying him for extended periods of time made our backs sore but I imagine that would happen with any type of weight strapped to the front of you like that. Getting our son in and out of the carrier wasn't that hard either. He is much more content to be carried in his baby Bjorn than to be in our arms."
2,needs a waist strap,"I bought this item for my 11 week old who weighs 12 lb since it has gotten such great reviews and I was looking for a forward facing carrier. I must say that I am a bit disappointed with it. First it sits too high on the chest making it easy for his head to hit my chin when facing outward. Also this is a carrier that one cannot nurse with, unfortunately, when facing inward. But most irksome is the stress that it places upon my back. I am a fit, active woman of average height who has never had an issue with my back- not even during pregnancy but this carrier makes my mid to upper back tired and strained. I also have an Ergo carrier which is very comfortable but is only an inward facing carrier. The Ergo has a hefty waist strap that bears all the weight leaving the shoulders free of strain. The Bjorn carrier is probably great for the first 2 months but I can't imagine carrying a 15 or 20 lb infant in it."
3,"Good for newborns, but....","I loved my bjorn when my baby was a newborn, but after she got a little bigger I felt like all of the weight was on my shoulders! (and yes, I even went to a baby wearing expert to adjust it- it did not help) And I read that the ""crotch"" hold of the bjorn can compress a baby's growing spine. I switched to the Ergo Carrier at about 4 months and could not have been happier with the Ergo- all the weight is on my hips, and although she faces inward in the front carry position, she can switch to side or back carrier to see more. (and it is great when she falls asleep!)"
3,Baby sweats in this carrier,"This is a secure carrier, but my baby gets overheated in it even in the wintertime. The padding on the front of the carrier is so thick that it does not breathe. The BabyBjorn isn't machine washable, so just hope that your little one doesn't spit up on it or have an accident in it. I ended up selling this carrier and buying the New Native Baby carrier. It is breathable, machine washable, and has many different positions you can carry your baby in."
2,There are much better options out there,"While this product is likely the best known of the infant carriers, it is definitely not the best choice. While the carrier is useful for a very small baby, it cannot be used when your child gets a bit bigger. Additionally, this type of carrier where the legs dangle outwards puts a lot of pressure on the pelvis and spine of developing babies. There is a risk that it can cause damage to the lower spine.If you are looking for a baby carrier that can be used for a longer period, and that is more ergonomically sound for you and your baby, check out options like the Ergo, the Cuddly Wrap, the Baby Hawk Mei Tei, and the Beco. These are more versatile and more afforable options out there."
5,AN ATTACHMENT PARENTING MUST-HAVE!!!,"If there is one thing that I could say was a great investment, the Baby Bjorn is it! This thing is amazing. It is expensive, but completely worth it when you consider its versatility as well as its comfort factor. I have not had any back pain whatsoever (the trick is to wear baby up high) and I use it all the time. It's so great that I even use it to work out at the gym. It keeps baby close and comfortable, which is what she wants. My daughter falls asleep almost every time I put her in it. She loves it, and so do I!"
2,Awful on back and shoulders...,"My baby is 8 weeks old and weighs 12 lbs. I've been wearing him in the bjorn around the house and my shoulders and back are strained and sore. The Moby was not working, so I switched to this in hopes that it would be better. He sleeps well while next to me and in the carrier, but I'm so uncomfortable. Disappointed we spent the money."
4,Babybjorn baby carrier,It's very comfortable and easy to use. we liked it so much and made traveling with the baby a much easier and enjoyable thing to do. thanks BabyBjorn for your well designed and high quality product.
5,Great way to carry your baby!,This carrier is the best thing we bought for our baby. It keeps her close and feeling safe and you can move around and get things done with your arms free. It is easy to use and seems very well made. Love it!
5,Best Baby Carrier out there!,Just purchased this baby carrier for my newborn. I have been shopping for a baby carrier that would be comfortable for baby and would not put so much pressure on my back.This carrier was the best out of the ones I looked at. I can not wait to use this on grocery trips and walks with my baby! I would recommend this to all my friends and family! I love my baby bjorn!
5,LIFE SAVER!,"So glad I made the purchase to get this Bjorn carrier. I needed something I could use for my 3 week old that never wanted me to put her down. This was super easy to use and I liked that I didn't need an insert for it since she was so small which most carriers need. She instantly falls asleep in it which is an added bonus as well. I've actually found it pretty comfortable, but then again she's 6 weeks now and only about 10lbs. Not sure how it will feel once she's bigger, but I would definitely recommend this for newborns."
3,Baby Bjorn (mama here),I love the baby bjorn idea but being 5'3'' 110 lbs it has been very hard and impossible for me to use it. It hurts my back very badly. I can usually not handle carrying my baby girl for more than 5 min at a time! She was about 3 months when I first used it and was about 11 lbs and even that was uncomfortable. She is now 5 months and weighs about 15 lbs and I def can't handle it!So mama's I would say you have to be pretty strong to use this product or maybe let the papa's so the baby bjornin'.
4,Great for Mom... Not so great for Dad...,"I bought this carrier after reading many reviews and trying them out at the store... My mistake was going by myself. Being 5'7"", the carrier works great for me. But for my husband who is 6'4"" (athletic build) the carrier does not work. However, I do not think that there is a front carrier that would work for his size. We decided that this wasn't a big concern since I will be the one using the carrier. I have used it on many outings and it is great. My eight-week old daughter is very content in it. It is very easy to get the baby in and out without assistance. It works great for trips when I have both of my girls by myself (i.e. the grocery store - I have the baby in the carrier and my older daughter (age 4) in the cart seat.) I strongly recommend this carrier, as long as you understand that it has limitations when it comes to the size of the person using it -- if you don't, then you will probably be disappointed."
4,most secure carrier out there,"I've been using this carrier since my son was about 2 months, and I still use it all the time now that he is almost one year. It is absolutely the most secure carrier there is, I've tried sling carriers and they always feel unsafe. My only suggestion is to spend the extra money and get the active one. I didn't because it seemed too expensive but it's worth it if you plan on carrying around a heavier baby. Even if you're not using it on hikes you will appreciate the relief it gives your back."
5,Must have !!,I had always looked at people using those and thought it's a nice product.Now I say it's a must have. it's comfortable and stands to the quality it mentions in the specifications.and in time delivery ( that too with amazon free shipping ) made it a pleasant experience.
4,Good for short periods of time.,"This is a good product as most Bjorns are. The baby is easy to slide in and out of the carrier. My only complaint is that my lower back begins to hurt after I've had her in it for awhile. (She is 14 lbs) I wish I had bought the active one with the lumbar support. So it's good for short amounts of time, but I'd suggest the active one if you plan on using it a lot like me."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have used three infant carriers and the Bjorn just does not compare to the other carriers that are available. I tried it out with my daughter (she was 5 months old at the time) in the backyard and my shoulders were so sore after just 15 minutes that I came in and decided to return it. The straps pull at your neck and shoulders, rubbing in between the shoulder blades. And this was with a small, young baby! Spend just a little extra for the Ergo, a carrier that I am still using comfortably with my 14 month, 24 pound daughter."
2,hurts neck and back after 5 minutes,"Now that my baby (age 2 months) is 12 lbs, I can't stand to wear this carrier for more than 5 minutes. After 5 minutes it kills my back and my neck. Right now my neck and back are so sore because I wore it for 15 minutes today. It just puts too much strain on the shoulders, neck and back, and now I'm paying the price. I'm never using this thing again. Baby loves it and is fine as long as I keep moving when wearing it, but I'm looking for another carrier now. It's not like I'm a weakling either - I'm in good shape and work out with weights regularly."
5,worth the money,I have used this carrier with both of my children. They love it. i just throw it in the washer to clean it and it still looks the same 4 years later. This was the best gift i received!
3,Not good for backpain people,"Simple. If you have a backpain problem, this product is no good, I used on my 2 month daughter and my back pain came back. Other than that it seems pretty good, for just newborn babies, in my opinion"
5,Love It!,"I have been wanting to purchase the baby bjorn,and finally ,we did!! It is very comfortable to wear and our baby loves it. He pretty much sleeps in it when we take our older child for a walk. I recommend anyone looking for a infant carrier to purchase this one.I had a evenflo brand for my older child when he was small,and hated it. Not comfortable,it had no support like this one does."
1,Ouch my back and shoulders,"We recieved the baby Bjorn as a gift and were excited to try it out. It wasn't so horrible when my son was first born, but as he gained weight both my partner and I found that the bjorn caused excruciating back pain really quickly. We both attribute this to the fact that it has NO lumbar support. I looked online and found out that Bjorn has recently made a carrier WITH a lumbar support. If you are going to buy a Bjorn I would highly recommend spending the extra money.My other concern with the Bjorn is that my son seemed to be to big for it by the time he reached 16 pounds. Just too tall.The thing I like about the Bjorn is that baby can face in or face out. This is great for when they are able to hold up their own head.As for me, I found that something like the moby wrap, which is a long piece of fabric you wrap around yourself, gave me great lumbar support for a fraction of the price of a bjorn. The downside, my partner won't wear it because it is too girlie."
3,Good at first but not for long,When our baby was first born we thought the BB was great. But after about 10 weeks it went in the cupboard and never came out. $70 for 10 weeks....not really worth it if you ask me.I am perfectly capable of backpacking for a whole week with a 40lb pack but at 10 weeks old carrying our completely average baby in this for more than 10 mins or so really hurt my back.We searched around and eventually bought an Ergo Baby Carrier ([...]) and have never looked back. The Ergo is the best thing since sliced bread! It allows you to have the baby/child on your front or back and can work for newborns (with a support pillow) all the way up to 60lbs. Our 10month old loves it and it is comfortable to carry her in it for hours on end.
1,Awful and bad for your baby,"This carrier dangles your baby from his/her crotch. Get an ergonomic carrier, like a Beco or Ergo where the baby actually sits. Don't let your baby dangle in a way you would never want to. If you don't believe me, sit on the arm of your couch on your crotch. That is what baby feels. We hated it. Also, kills the back. No support whatsoever and baby will outgrow it super fast. Also, facing out is wrong. Baby has nowhere to hide his face from the world or seek comfort from mom or dad. And they inevitably fall asleep with the head dangling. I don't know who designed this or why it is so popular but don't let the price and all the celebrities draw you to it. It really is an awful carrier once you've tried what a real baby carrier should be."
5,Perfect for our new baby!,My husband and I are very pleased with our BABYBJORN. This product is easy to use and it is gender neutral so either him or I can use it.
4,my angel's first carrier,"It is my 4-month-old baby's first carrier. At the beginning, I wonder if she would like the carrier because I used to carry her in my arms. When I slide her into the carrier, she looks comfortable and enjoys staying in it. I am so happy, and my hands are free now,haha."
2,Great for About One Month,"We tried to use these with our twins when they were between 6 & 10 pounds. That was a non-starter. They were just too little to handle the positioning. Now they're about 15 pounds each. We got one decent day at the zoo, but even at just 15 pounds my chiropractor will be getting some business. These just aren't worth it. I recommend baby Moby when they're really little. Then move on to a baby ergo around 15 to 18 lbs."
4,Super helpful,"I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. I bought this so that I could finally have some hands free while baby and I are together. It was perfect for traveling. We used it to fly. There are no metal parts so I could walk right through the metal detector with baby sound asleep in the carrier. He can't sit on his own yet, and his car seat was taking up a ton of room in grocery carts, so using the baby bjorn to go grocery shopping has been a life saver. It does cause some back strain after a while, but for an hour or two it is ideal!"
5,Very comfortable to wear.,"I really like this carrier. I think it's comfortable for me to wear, and my baby (5 weeks old) fell asleep immediately the first time I put her in it. I think it's really comfortable for her too. The baby feels very secure, I know she won't fall out or twist her neck."
3,Works well -- kid can get hot,"If you're unsure if this is something you will want to use, then buying the original BabyBjorn from Amazon is your best bet -- you'll get a very functional product at a great price compared to Babies R Us or Buy Buy Baby.We use this product sparingly, but it is very handy in that it allows you to get your hands back and get some work done around that house while keeping your child safe and secure to you.Our child enjoys being in the harness. However, he will get hot if we are outside in the summer. If this is something you are going to use frequently, I would advise purchasing one of the higher-end, breathable models."
3,hurts my back,"We bought a Baby Bjorn and a Moby Wrap. I ended up not using the Bjorn because it hurt my back and shoulders a great deal. My husband wore it a few times, but we both found it difficult to get the baby in and out of."
3,"It's a good carrier, but it kills my back!","I used this carrier daily after my son was born but when he hit about 6 months, it got too hard to wear! I'm a babywearer and I love wearing him, but it really really started hurting as he gained weight. I like it because you can wear them forward when they're young/newborn and as they get older and more aware you can wear them facing outwards which is nice! But I ended up buying myself an ergo and really prefer it over the bjorn. My son is 16 months old now and I wear the ergo daily still, it's nice and really doesn't hurt my back as much as the bjorn did."
4,Great but to a certain weight,"We have used our Baby Bjorn almost every day since our baby was born. There have been many times when it's the only way we can get her to fall asleep. She loves it, particularly the forward facing view, which we've been using since she's been about 3 months. She just loves having a view of everything and kicks in happiness when she's in it. It's so easy to put on and super easy to put the baby in. It's easily adjustable (when my husband or I trade off). It's sturdy and easily washable without any fading or damaging of the material when washed. My only complaint is that my baby is no 7 months, about 19 pounds and about 27 inches and the top shoulder snaps are almost not closing any more when she has on a thick sweater. In addition, my back and shoulders hurt now after carrying her for a little while because the original had no waist/hip support strap. But, I still love it. We'll just have to get a different carrier now that's she's too large for it."
4,So easy to use!!!!,"I purchased this item after trying a cheaper model without success. As soon as I tried it on I noticed the difference. It is worth the extra money with out a doubt. This thing is sturdy (the straps are nice and wide) and easy to handle by yourself. My cheaper model required another persons help in order to put it on, the straps were thin and dug into my shoulder blades. With this carrier, once the baby is strapped in, he/she isn't going anywhere!! It is solid, you won't be afraid that your baby will tip or fall over."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to use the bjorn but found the design to be flawed.1. The baby seems to be hanging in the seat. This does not seem to be a proper design for the baby's comfort.2. The neck piece got infants has plastic on either side do babies face is digging into plastic when they sleep3. TERRIBLY uncomfortable for mom (5'4"") small frame. I hated it. Would suffer after an hour or less of use.One pro is the forward facing option for older babies but I couldn't stand having my 10lb baby in it.I wouldn't recommend :("
4,Convenient,This carrier is a must have!! I love its style and it is comfortable for me! My son does not complain! Worth the buy!
2,Lags behind innovation,They may have been at the forefront years ago but Babybjorn lags behind the more ergonomically advanced carriers. I am 6' and 200 lbs and this thing just kills my back because it puts all the weight at my shoulders. On top of this it is not the easiest thing to get the baby out!I will not mention other products in this review but their is a newer ergonomic design that distributes the weight to my hips and supports the baby in a position better for her spine. It is two to three times as much but it is five to ten times better so I still view it as a bargain.
4,Couldn't live without it!,"This carrier is a lifesaver - my baby won't sit in a stroller if awake, but loves the carrier. I use it daily - it's the only way I can get anything done, and is so much more convenient than a stroller at the store. We use it for hiking, and it fits well for my husband (who is 6'4"") and myself (5'4""), The only drawback is that I find it uncomfortable on my back after a while - I wish I had bought the sport version with the extra back support, I think it would have been worth the money now that I know how much I use it."
1,Horrible crippling pain.,"It was terrible on my back. I am a nanny and I would come home and be laying on the floor almost crippled from the pain any day that I used this product.There are other solutions that were so much better.Check the baby wearer website for better options.If you buy this one, you are just paying for the name."
2,Ouch!!,"I first used this product when my daughter was 3months old. I think she weighed around 10 pounds. She did not mind being in the Bjorn. However, when she got bigger and weighed heavier (about 17 lbs.) She did not like being in the bjorn at all. She cried and cried. I took her out and I noticed the hard plastic clip that clips the strap together was not padded. Ouch!! I was carrying her in the bjorn for 30 minutes. I noticed the clip left a dent mark on her diaper, groin area. I'm surprised the bjorn have such high ratings.Cons: Not good for warm climate, hard plastic clip at groin area( ouch!!), back pain lasted 2days.Pros: looks nice"
2,Much better alternatives out there for baby carriers,"Baby Bjorn was the pioneer for baby carriers 10 years ago but since then there has been an explosion in the market - slings, front carriers, pouches, etc. The BEST, in my honest opinion, is the Ergo. The baby sits with correct posture (The Bjorn is not so great for the baby's spine) and the parent is not in pain! I can walk for hours with my 20 lb baby in the Ergo -- not so in the Bjorn."
3,See if you really need it,"The product is good and does the job it promises in terms of features. Baby likes the body warmth and sleeps well in it.The thing we are asking ourself's after we bought it was, how much do we need it. We dont walk around too much outside the house and have used it twice in the last 4 weeks for less than 2 hours.We bough it because we wanted to use it in a flight trip abroad, but one of the major things that i missed analyzing was if it could be worn both in sitting and standing position for continuous use. The answer is no, you cant sit down with the baby in it, it is meant for a standing position. I dont see my baby in it for too long if i have to stand all the time and not take short sitting breaks without causing him discomfort or pain?"
2,Just buy an Ergo,"This carrier was fine when My son was tiny. It wasn't perfect but it worked. It doesn't distribute weight very well and was hell on my back. Recently I had to use a Bjorn again. We went to a museum and I forgot my Ergo (GASP!). Strollers were not allowed in the main building. The museum was gracious enough to allow me to use their Bjron for free. After that I will never forget my Ergo again! Carrying my 25lb 1 year old around in that thing was worthless. My back was killing me after about 10mins. No matter how I adjusted the thing it just wansn't working. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Ergo. If you can get your hands on a consignment/used one, AWESOME! If not, its totally worth every penny!!"
4,"Great carrier, but hard on the back","I like the BabyBjorn carrier and so does my baby. The only problem I have is that it hurts my back after not too much time wearing it. I find the Ergo much more comfy for myself, but the BabyBjorn doesn't get as hot on hot days, which is nice. It also allows for my baby to face forward and look around, which is not an option in the Ergo."
3,Too tight,"The item is great however, its for babies 18pds and under. BabyBjorn has a 25 pds cut off, that is a stretch."
3,Hard to get in and out of,"This product works well once the baby is in it, but it's very hard to get your child inside and out and frequently requires two people. My baby got upset and started screaming each time while being put in the carrier, but was content and fell asleep once in it. I liked that you could use it with infants."
3,Wish it came smaller,The carrier is perfect for an 8 lb baby or larger but my little guy is only 6.5 lbs. I'd love to be able to carry him around and still have my hands free but he is just too small for the carrier. Wish they made them for smaller babies. The actual construction is very good; sturdy material. Can't wait to be able to use it.
3,Not good for babies over 15 lbs and/or 26 inches,"We were only to use it when our son is 5 weeks old till he was 3 months old (16 lbs), it's good for newborn who's able to support his own head and he felt alseep in it while where him. Once the baby is over 15lbs, you'll feel most of the weights are on your back and shoulder. Like child birth isn't enough of a strain on mom's back already, this is NOT designed for wearing a long period of time (15 mins and longer). We just purchased the Cybex 2.GO baby carrier from a local store to replace Bjorn original. We were able to try on the Cybex at the store, weights are much well distributed on your hips and shoulder. If you plan on wearing your baby for more than 3 months, I wouldn't recommend Baby Bjorn Original. Try Ergo, Beco or Cybex instead."
4,Good Quality,"I don't know if all the baby carriers are like this one or not. I haven't tried any other products. The thing is, this carrier is only suitable up to a certain weight, a lot less than what it's supposed to carry. Our son who's around 14 pounds does no longer fit inside it and he has a relatively small body. Other than this, the carrier is of good quality and has proper arrangement not to put much pressure on the back."
3,Hurts my back big time and too expensive,"After a few days of using it, it hurts my back. I wasn't able to sleep for several nights.My son does like to be carried around in it and he sleeps in the carrier very well."
2,hurts my back and bad for baby,This item looked great and people seem to really like it but It was a huge waste for us. It hurt my back the baby hated it and a bunch of infant development specialist say that the crotch dangling position is bad for the baby's development. We are consigning ours. I use a moby wrap now.
2,ITS ALRIGHT,I THOUGHT MY BABY WOULD LIKE IT SHE HATES IT WE TRY TO HAVE HER STAY IN IT BUT CRYS AND THATS FUNNY CAUSE SHE IS A GOOD BABY
3,Doesnt feel sturdy!,"Product has not failed us yet, but it is hard to put rely on it. we alway keep a hand under our baby, thinking ""Just Incase"". for some reason we dont have a faith in it.Doesnt mean that product is bad, but could be more sturdy, a bit unconfortable for long use."
2,Not for a young one - she hated it until she was facing forward,"At one month baby really hated being in this carrier. Something about it was very uncomfortable, she preferred the sling carrier. Once she outgrew that and faced forward her attitude changed. Once she hit 20 or so lbs though, the weight was too much. I actually bruised my sternum carrying her, it was a painful 3 week recovery. We both liked the Kelty backpack better at that point and she still fits in it at 20 months."
2,Look at the back straps! BUY SYNERGY WITH BACK SUPPORT!,"Don't you think those back straps will pull your shoulders forward? YES they will. My back started to hurt after 5 minutes walking with my 9 lbs baby! I give not 1 but 2 stars because it is a good quality, strong, VERY easy to use baby carrier, BUT invest more money in it and buyBabyBjörn Baby Carrier Synergy - BlackIt has that magic back support! P.S> You have to adjust the straps as your baby grows then nothing will press against her diaper area or anywhere else."
5,BabyBjorn Baby Carrier Original - City Black,"Baby Bjorn is the one and only carrier - completely upgraded safety wise to current specs. Even better than the one I used 8 years ago for my last baby and that was fabulous... still as easy to use getting on and off, comfortable and stylish."
4,great product,"This is a great product I used it with both of my kids and have it stored for baby number three. It is really great for times when the baby is fussy and needs you but you need your hands. I also used it extensively in the first year for hiking and anywhere offroad that wouldn't accomodate a stroller. It is also great to use on flights when your baby is on your lap, your baby is secure and your hands are free if baby falls asleep. It is also great for airport security. My son is smaller and he used it until he was almost 2. My daughter however was quite big so she could only fit in there until up to 6 months. Once the baby is bigger though, this is not ideal because it will cause back pain after extended use."
2,There are more ergonomic carriers out there,"I cannot recommend this carrier. Unfortunately the baby's legs just dangle down when the baby sits in this carrier which is not good at all for the baby's hip joint - the legs have to be spread to a certain extent which they are not in this carrier (and quite a few other carriers as well). I therefore recommend a sling like the Ella Roo or the Ergo Baby Carrier or the Bondolino which support this position. This carrier may be comfortable for the parent, but the baby's health is also an important issue..."
5,Baby Bjorn,"We absolutely love the Bjorn - this is our favorite item. Daddy wears it too. Since our Baby has been 2 months old she loves to be in the Bjorn and face out. When we go shopping she would rather be in it then her infant seat. The biggest bonus is that she can fall alseep in it when she wants to. We even use it on those nights where she is fighting going to sleep, put her in it and start doing stuff around the house she is asleep in no time from the swaying movement. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY NEW PARENT"
4,pretty great product,"I have wanted the Baby Bjorn since we thought about having kids. It is a great product and easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that my baby is the recommended start weight and she seems to still be too small to use it at this point. She is over 8 lbs. and she is 21 inches, but her head seems to be really unstable. I have tightened the top straps and her head either falls to the side or smashes right into my chest, which makes me worry that she can't breathe. However, I think that once she gets a little bigger we will be using this constantly, as she seems really comfy in there."
5,Love my baby bjorn,"Want to get some house work done, but the baby wants you to be held? Slap this carrier on and you can do anything! When they're real little and have no neck control they have to face your chest. My baby screamed the entire time. I thought I had wasted my money on this thing. But at 2-3 months he was able to turn around and look at the world. And he has been cruising around with me ever since."
3,Didn't get to use it very long...,"I loved the style of the bjorn (not frumpy or fluffy) and it was must-have on my registry list. It was fun to carry my little guy around in, but after he hit 15 pounds (at 4 months) it hurt my back and neck to even wear him in it for 15 minutes. I ended up doing some research and switching to a Mei Tai (also called an Asian Baby carrier) which has been much easier on my back. My boy is now 14 months old and I am still using the Mei Tai..."
2,Kills your back if you're too tall,"This carrier puts all the baby's weight on your shoulders and upper back. I can stand it until the baby's about 10 pounds, but after that, it's just plain painful.The pain starts in my shoulders, where the straps start to dig in. Then it moves to my lower back, which is straining to stay straight with 10+ pounds of baby pulling my upper back forward. Then my stomach muscles start to ache too.The only time i ever use this carrier is at the grocery story, where the fact that it is pretty easy to get set up solo is a major benefit. For walks at home when i can take the time to get the it set up, or any time i can borrow another pair of hands, i use theERGOcarrier, which keeps the weight on my hips instead of contorting my spine."
2,Not as great as said by most,"Yeah i read the reviews on how great this album is. Dont get me wrong its unique but that doesnt mean im gonna feel it. Im sure some underground head is gonna read this and trip and write a review dissin me. So let me tell you there is just as much fake ass artists in the underground as mainstream. So dont discriminate mainstream and underground. Give mainstream a chance. You might like it. I dont even talk about whats what anymore. I like Outkast, The Game, and some G Unit that doesnt make me a ""a non true hip hop head"". Oh yeah back to the album. I really didnt like it cuz it was borin and left me thinking about other things. Im mad that i bought this cd. I will give him a 2 star for effort though. Heed my words majority kids!"
1,sorry,"i hate to sh*t on underground rap but funcrusher plus is the only good thing el ps ever done. his flow isnt catchy, i cant understand him, his beats are non melodic. someone will say im too dumb to appreciate him. whatever. there are plenty better mcs in the underground than this:mf doom, murs, c rayz walz, dilated, beatnuts, non phixion, necro and pretty much everyone makes better music than ginger boy. hes a geek with a ginger mustache and he sips ammonia"
1,Experimental? Please.,"At times there is a fine line between experimental Hip hop, and audio sewage. With Fantastic Damage, El-P blew through that threshold: This album is just plain terrible. I tried giving it the benefit of a doubt because of the C-Flow Funcrusher Plus album (I don't thing I need to contest the quality of that album). After the first four tracks of Fantastic Damage, I wanted to punch myself in the ass. How could I have been duped into buying such a waste? For the next 30 seconds, I found myself pressing the 'next track' button. By track 15, I was hitting it. I think I finally figured out why Company Flow broke up."
1,"dear el-p,","this album is total crap.if you want real experimental hip-hop check out the anticon crew. there is nothing ""new"" about any of this sludge...just listen to the samples to experience the pain this man has inflicted upon society. he should be caned...or flogged...or something that involves a sack of oranges."
5,keep on clicking!,"I use this to reliably count the number of birds and butterflies that fly by our observation platform. As a mechanical device this is one that never needs batteries, and always works well. With the sound of the click I know that the hawk or monarch has been counted without having to check visually."
5,I hunted for this everywhere,This was exactly what I needed and only this would do. Thanks it is perfect. My 80-yo father-in-law rides his bicycle around his assisted living facility. He kept losing count of how many times he went. We needed the mechanical easy thumb touch model not the digital items more readily available. He now uses it daily to go 35 labs (6 miles)
1,Piece of Shit,"Do not buy this from this seller. It is a piece of shit that does not even work. When I try to press the clicker, it barely turns to the next one... you sometime have to press more than once..."
5,tally counter,"Bought this for my wife. She uses it to keep track of the number of laps she walks over at the community walking track facility. She has commented a number of times how helpful this has been. She loves it, light weight, easy to use, user friendly."
4,Keep A Tally Of Almost Anything,Simple and easy to use. The unit has been dropped and gotten wet numerous times and still works fine. We use them on fishing trips to keep track of our catches. Only wish it would have been a bit smaller.
2,"He loves it! Well, he DID","My husband uses this every day at the YMCA to count his laps. He was more than pleased with it, for three months, then it quit working. It will be replaced with one from another seller."
5,Great for use as a row counter for knitting or crocheting!,"I purchased this item to use as a row counter for crocheting projects. It's very sturdy, and works really well to serve its purpose."
5,Got me through an adventure race!,"While other clickers/counters were breaking and failing, this one worked the entire time. Its a little awkward to hold sometimes, and I wish it came with a mount for hiking poles, but it did its job."
5,Well pleased,My Girlfriend was well pleased with this product as she uses it to excercise around a hockey rink in Brooklyn so needed to know just how many laps she had done
1,numbers get stuck together,every time I clicked it the numbers would get stuck together. It took too much effort to push the button.
3,Not for the 5-6 year old market,"This book has many jokes, but also has several pages of workbook exercises on humor. How to make up a joke, how to deliver a punch line, etc. . . It's not a passive reader, the child must interact with the book--and a pen. If you just want a book full of jokes, pick a different one. If you have an independent reader that wants to develop his or her joke telling skills as well as picking up a few new jokes, then this would be a good choice for you."
4,Worth buying,One of my kids has this book and loves it. I read it and couldn't help but laughing at some of the jokes. This would make the perfect gift for a child 6-12 years old.
3,These Jokes are way above my grandsons head!,This is a cute book but I need to do a better job of reviewing books before I buy them. It is hard for my grandson and some of his friends to get a laugh out of the jokes that are a little advanced for them. They are ages 7 through 8.
3,goofy jokes for young kids,"The Everything Kids' Joke Book: Side-Splitting, Rib-Tickling Fun (Everything Kids Series)I don't know what to say. These are really silly jokes. Some are over the head of my 4 year old. He had been trying to make up his own (not even funny) jokes and I thought this book would help. But he wasn't really ready for it. We'll keep it til he gets a bit older. They are silly and not funny to a grown up but for kids they are probably right on if you have the right age."
5,Deeply Soulful,"I just found this yesterday in a bin for a couple bucks; very very very pleased with this purchase; would've paid much more, and I don't even like the trombone actually, not enough punch. I had no high hopes, I just knew of the quality of some of Turre's past work for other musicians.But from the first notes I knew this would be a totally superior album: great players all pulling together. Just Love it.Turre is so good, his instrument sings, it's so soulful. I may have to re-evaluate my whole 'bone (head) attitude. Ellington's ""In A Sentimental Mood"" is a slow, moody, revelation.And I'm not too fond of vocals either, but cut 9, Rahsaan's ""Spirits Up Above"" was rousing; energy enhancing; I'm just very happy. Great work all around.Find this album; then you'll be happy."
5,Works Great,I used this waterproof pouch to carry two epi pen jr.'s for my son while we used the waterpark at Great Wolf Lodge. They fit great. The pouch was easy to open and close. No water got in.
3,Kwik Tek Dry Pak Cell Phone Case,If you want to buy this product. Firstly you have to think how many times you stay steamy places. Because in steamy places doesn't work correctly..
2,Good product but not for my phone,this mobile action cord was great no probs i just had to get the software of their site for my sony ericsson t226. but the features that it supported for my phone was minimal. i bought this product to hopefully make ringtones but it doesnt support midi ringtones it only splices mp3 files which all my media programs do that. this will backup your contacts on the pc and charge your phone and thats about it. consider saving you money if buying this for a t226. cheap phone = useless features
1,Timer not very reliable,We bought this for my turtle. The timer is very cheap. Please consider getting the digital timers. I spent $10 and got a single outlet one for the lights. The filter and heater are in a regular outlet as they never shut off.
1,Terrible,"It does not keep time or get stuck at the time it's supposed to turn on (or off). Don't waste your money, just buy two timers that actually work."
2,"Timer can be set to either Day or NIte, but a 3rd Off mode","I was hoping to save energy by using this timer, but not. I didn't want the nite lites on at all evening hours, only for an esthetics glow at night and then completely off until the morning rises again. This timer does not allow for all 3 modes, only day and night modes can be set. Best used for tidal modes application if you have salt, but I only have freshwater tropicals just now."
2,will probably break within a year,"i like the design and functionality of this timer. when it is working, it works well and does the simple job of switching power. however, something in my mechanical timer broke and stopped working after a few months, just outside of the seller's 60-day warranty. i will be contacting the vendor about getting a digital replacement, although i have read there are some bugs with that as well...overall i was disappointed by the overall lack of quality. is it that hard to make a decent timer that will run for more than a few months?"
2,Timer's seem cheaply constructed,This just seems to be mechanically cheap. The timers start to get off by 30-45 minutes every week.... not a huge deal but a pain to keep resetting.
3,First one down,"I just sent back my first unit and ordered a new one. The product was very user friendly. The issue was when the timer switched from night to day the unit would get stuck. Hopefully, the new unit will be free of this flaw and then 5 star. P.S. the first one I received had been previously opened which made me curious as to whether the issue was of prior knowledge to the seller."
4,Ok,Its OK IMO. It works well some tabs are very hard to adjust. Overall its ok. Took me a minute to figure the whole tab thing out.
1,P.O.S,"The timer never goes off on the time I set it, its always like half an hour later or so. Whats even far more annoying is the fact that as time goes by, the lights go on later and later and later until finally I have to re-do the settings. I have no idea what causes this but it is damn annoying. Another really annoying thing is how hard to it is to set the timer tabs. Some of them are so stiff that I had to use tools to push them up or down in fear of my nail breaking off. Dont waste ur time with this product. Biggest piece of junk timer there is on the market."
1,find something else to buy,"if you need this timer to keep time you better find another one to buy. Everyday I had to reset the time, it was off by hours not mintues."
1,"Good idea, poor quality","Great idea for controlling lights and simulating a normal light cycle. However, this product is poorly made. I called the manufacturer and told them that the timer was losing about an hour each 24-hour period. Each day I had to reset the timer to reflect the correct time. The manufacturer sent me a replacement item. After a couple of days, the replacement also lost an hour each day. Save your money. Go to a big box hardware store and buy a timer with multiple outlets. They are constructed better and cost less."
1,Timer stopped working,"Within 4 months of use, the timer has stopped working, making the bottom 4 plug points unusable. I use it for my reef tank with a covered refugium tank, so not sure if it had to do with salt particles somehow getting into the dial area."
2,Wish I had made a different choice,"I own two of these and within about a year of purchase they have both become unreliable. One loses so much time that I have to correct it every few days and the other doesn't reliably ""trip"" my lights. I noticed last night after the time that the lights should have been out, that they were still on. In checking, the timers and time were all correct, it just apparently hadn't triggered the lights to turn off. As someone who travels a lot and has a friend care for the tanks once a day, I need my timers to do their job, so I will have to be replacing them. If you are deciding on a purchase, keep looking!"
1,Paying something for nothing,"I ordered this product,for my son, for Christmas. It arrived quickly. I gave it to him early because he needed to use it. My son plugged the ""Power Center"" into the wall out let. Then, he already knows how to run the item, he clicked up the first ""tab"" to start programming the ""Day and Night"" features. The ""Dial"" in the center of the product blew sparks, burned my son's finger and blew the surge protecter on the device. I have had to PAY THE SHIPPING TO SEND THIS ITEM BACK. I WILL GET A REFUND,OF THE ORIGINAL PRICE THAT I PAID-AND THE SELLER HAS ALREADY RECEIVED HIS PAYMENT FROM ME, BUT I HAD TO PAY $11.19 to send it back. So I had to pay something for nothing!"
1,Just a power strip,"Do Not Buy This Product!!! The worst feeling in the world is to read bad reviews of certain products and not take heed to the warnings. Do Not Buy This Product!!! It sounds like a very cool and convenient product but Do Not Buy This Product!!! It does not work. This is nothing but a very expensive power strip. The timer does not work. Do not be like me and buy this product after reading so many bad reviews about it. The timer feature is the reason why I bought this item. The timer feature is the only feature that doesn't work. The set up is simple enough although the wording of the directions will have you thinking that you set it up wrong. I've tried every program, every mode,every outlet, everything. The lcd works, the outlets works, but not the timer. If the timer is important to you, Do Not Buy This Product!!!. I've waited 24hrs in each mode to no avail. Don't Do It!!!"
3,Old book,"I bought this because I remember how hilarious my mother and aunt thought it was. I did not think so, but the seller did ship it quickly and packaged it well. No complaints about them."
3,Great product,"I received this product in a timely manner..Everything was just fine, but I think that the item is over priced..I do, however, look for bargains..I would recommend this product.."
3,love cookies,Love cookies but $7.00 dollars plus shipping for 16 cookies is too much for me. If u love oreos you will love these cookies.
3,Pumpkin costume,"Just as cute as the photo. My son is 6 and it fit him pretty well. Bigger kids would probably have trouble fitting into the arm and leg holes which were pretty tight. Also the design didn't allow for good leg movement, so my son had a little trouble running from house to house as fast as he wanted - I suppose that made it easier for me to keep up :) I ended up pushing the bottom of the legs up to knee level - not worn as pants as shown in the photo. Still it was pretty restricting."
3,We bought this pumpkin costume to make violet beauregarde blow up. It did NOT work.,"While it blew up just fine by itself, the fan motor wasn't strong enough to blow it up under a light weight dress. Also, the on off switch is on the fan, facing the body, in the back, down by the hip. It would have been impossible to turn it on on stage. We ended up using an inflatable sumo costume."
2,Mostly instruction,"I was disappointed in this video, because I expected to learn more physical motions. The actions I learned from this video are extremely simple: that's good. The instructions are clear, very detailed, and slowly spoken. There are 35 minutes of introduction, comments by practitioners of qigong, general information, warm-up and instruction during wich I learned the motions for earth, metal, water, wood, fire. After the detailed instructions for each gesture, there's an opportunity to practice fluidly along with the demonstrator. This takes all of five minutes. Then there's a wind-down. Seniors might be interested to know that the class demonstrating the warm-up are all older adults. People who have difficulty understanding foreign accents might want to avoid this video."
1,qigong at its worst,"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST QIGONG INSTRUCTION I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE OTHER QIGONG DVDS, AND I HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH THEM FOR I CAN SEE THE BENEFITS ONE CAN DERIVE FROM THEM. THE MOVEMENTS IN THESE INSTRUCTIONAL DVDS RESULT IN AN UPLIFTING FEELING WHICH A GOOD EXERCISE WILL GENERATE. NOT SO WITH THIS ONE.I'M SURPRISED ABOUT THE POOR QUALITY OF THIS DVD, BECAUSE PAUL LAM'S FIVE FORM TAI CHI IS EXCELLENT. I DON'T SEE HOW HE WENT SO WRONG WITH THIS ONE.SO DON'T SAY I DIDN'T TELL YOU."
5,It's like nothing else out there,"The last review sounds like a bit of sour grapes. Every one of the players he listed were outliers that NO prognoticator would have predicted. However, Shandler's book is not just about projections. In fact, if you just use the projections, you are completely overlooking the power of the book. The Forecaster is about deconstructing player performance into its component parts and then finding the indicators that truly project the future. Is it correct 100% of the time? No, but who is? I've bought this book for the last nine years (5 championships and 2 more money finishes) and I would never go into my fantasy season without it."
4,This album stands on its own and is a treat,"Paul Weller fans know that his music changes from album to album, but the quality and his roots in R&B are ever present. This album is more of the same -- which means it stands on its own as an album worth adding to your collection. If you are looking for a Jam or Style-Council album, or a the 90s Paul Weller sound you should buy one of those albums. If you want to follow along with Weller on his musical journey you won't be disappointed."
5,It just gets better,"No one expects a musician to stay around this long,let alone get better with age! Paul Weller is one of a small group of artists who remains true to himself and the music. No ..., just pure passion. This album is terrific from start to finish. It is almost impossible to not have at least half the tunes happily stuck in your head. One listen and I was hooked! Enjoy!"
4,"Mellow, smooth, but hooks you in!","In terms of knowing what to expect of Mr. Weller's music, I'm rather hampered by having whipped through the music of various parts of his career with absolutely no regard for chronological order...having started listening to Style Council, going back to The Jam, then skipping ahead to this latest solo release. While the album as a whole was a bit more mellow and slow-paced than I expected, it is a superb and rare example of great melodic rock written by a smart, mature, socially conscious adult (who is pretty easy on the eyes as well!) Mellow in this case definitely does not equal boring, and if the sign of good pop music is that a song can stick in your head all day upon one listening and without making you want to remove it forcibly with a baseball bat, then the first 4 tracks here are definite gems."
3,"Great Songs, Great Bonus, Middling Production","Now that I've had this disc for a year and half. And I've let it settle in. It dawned on me that the material is superb. But the production ... especially overlayering of many multitracked parts instead of relying on more ""live"" performances ... is heavy-handed and kind of sucks the life out of the performances. I couldn't quite put my finger on it when I first bought this disc in London while visiting on business. I, too, was a Jam fan since finding a cut-out of ""This Is The Modern World"" in a small record shop during the summer of 1979 (oh yeah!). So ... Weller is a long, long standing favorite of mine. In the end, I enjoy spinning this disc now by enjoying the songs and Weller's song craft. These tunes hang with his best."
4,Illumination,"I didn't like this album as much as stanley road, but it's still f***ing amazing. Paul is quite simply one of the best songwriter's of our time. If not the best. The album has the distinctive rhythmic weller feel to it. Notable tracks are Standing out in the Universe, Call Me No.5, It's Written in the Stars and A Bullet for Everyone. Paul Weller creates a wonderful feeling and an album that will cover all your moods."
5,egg protein,One of the best high-protein egg products on the market. I have used it for several years with great results.Dr. J. D. Chandler
3,Now with eggshell!,"Or so it seems. Very difficult to choke down. I was shocked that they expect this to go down in a drink. Finally, I mixed it with oatmeal and it was more tolerable. On the plus side is that it appears to be low in sodium compared to others, so I recommend this product but you'll have to experiment to find a way to get it down."
1,I would NEVER order from this company again.,"The company took payment, and then nothing. Weeks pass, no product. Then trying to get them to send the product took more time, and still no product. Suddenly an e-mail that says ""Oh we're sorry we'll give you your money back."" I wasn't asking for the money back, I wanted the product, I specifically was e-mailing them asking for nothing but the product itself. I highly suggest choosing a vendor other than ""Health Genesis"" when purchasing products such as this online."
4,egg protein,It appears that the product is made of whole eggs but it actually made of egg whites only.
2,Addition of stevia has ruined this product!,"I have used this product for a couple of years and have loved it. I recently purchased a new container and made a smoothie for breakfast the other day. I immediately noticed that it is overwhelmingly sweet - something I never noticed before. I also noticed an aftertaste. I checked the ingredients and found the culprit - They are now adding stevia. Such a shame to ruin what was a perfect product. It didn't need the added sweetener, and now it is over the top on sweetness. I will not buy this product again."
3,not as good as it used to be !!!,"I have been a Vitol 100% Egg Protein user for almost 30 years and find myself very disappointed in the new and ""un""improved flavor. The old formula was much better for mixing with fruit smoothies, milk shake/frozen cappuccino type drinks and oatmeal without adding any unwanted flavor. Most mornings I would load up my ""VitaMix"" up with pineapple,bananas,frozen starwberries,plain yogurt and Vitol's 100% Protein without any added sweetners and enjoyed it,,,,now I find myself searching for something better.The new formula mixes rather easily with a hand mixer with milk or water, tastes ""ok"", but is too sweet for me and also leaves sort of a bitter aftertaste. I have also recently compared this to Rose Acre Farms ""Dried Egg Whites"" and Healthy 'N Fit ""100% Egg Protein. I have to say I prefer Vitol over the other two brands but wish they would go back to the original formula."
4,Wonderful Protein Powder; only 4 stars though for wasteful packaging,"I really like this powder; it's flavorful and extremely healthy. My only complaint is that the huge container comes only about 1/2 full! This is a massive waste of plastic, not to mention making the product more expensive to ship (more cardboard for a larger box, and so on) and this wasteful practice results in my giving the product only 4 stars instead of 5. Let's get on board to being more environmentally conscious about our products! Reduce the size of this container and consider an easier to recycle option that does not use plastic."
4,whey intolerent? try this!!,"This egg protein powder is pretty cool. A great alternative to whey protein & goat whey.This powder is best mixed with juice or the crystal light flavor of your choice. It is a little gritty, so if your diet allows fruit, it is nice mixed with a banana. Nice alternative to get away from the every day protein powder flavors."
5,"Great tasting, versatile protein supplement!","Vitol egg is great - it tastes much better than whey and has almost as high BV (biological value). You can add it to almost anything since it isn't sweetened, and you can use the sweetener of your choice. If you try it in your protein shakes, you'll never go back to whey."
2,A View on Natural Vanilla Flavor,"Vitol, 100% egg white protein powder - Ice Cream Vanilla flavor. I believe the popularity of this product is due to its sweetness and it's amazing vanilla flavor. Google Natural Vanilla Flavor and you come with many variations. The one I like the best is from EdenFoods.com. Natural Vanilla Flavor is an extract of many things using animal glycerin or propylene glycol (antifreeze) and an assortment of other synthetic or toxic chemicals. You may want to re-think your smoothie next time."
1,Heavily sweetened,"I was disappointed that a product advertised as free of sweeteners would contain such a large amount of Stevia. The vanilla flavor is overpowering, and the product is very sweet. This is unfortunate, as the product has a good texture, and I like the addition of bee pollen, but for consumers trying to avoid sweeteners, it's utterly useless."
5,This is one awesome book!,While I understood pointers I always felt a little uncomfortable with them - this book has made things crystal clear. It has helped me to understand pointer and memory management concepts and pitfalls and has made me a much better programmer. This is NOT the book for you if you are trying to learn C++ or are at a beginner level - this is for the intermediate to heavy C++ programmer who wants to improve his/her coding skills and depth of knowledge.
5,Like to master C or C++? You won't if you avoid this book,"I have read this book five times front to back and back to front, as a C\C++ Systems programmer this book proves invaluable in manipulating data more effiiciently than any other book on the subject. This book is well diagramed and supported with text dissections that explain why the code was coded the way it was, not leaving you directionless and frustrated. I suggest for the novice programmer to get this book, because it will give you a head start over the average beginner. I would couple this book with some real world working code, perhaps in C\C++ Journal and correlate the how syntactically and semanctically the pointers tie together. Figit with the code examples and be prepared to experiment, you will not regret it. Great reference for advanced professionals as well. Only inkling that is the ugly book cover and wish to have a smaller textbook, like Addison-Wesley's C++ Primer 2nd Edition by Stanley Lippman"
4,Good for everyday photo prints,"I have been using this paper for regular photo prints or picture cards. With a HP DeskJet, the prints on this paper are more refined, clearer, livelier than on the bright white Inkjet papers. For enlargements or exhibition or photo albums I would use a higher-grade photo paper of better quality."
3,Life after Dying,"Found book to be very comforting; especially for those who have lost loved ones (especially infants and children). If you are interested in knowing what happens when we die or what heaven is like, I recommend this book. This book was similar to ""Divine Revelation of Heaven"" but not as in depth."
5,Excellent book,Magnificient descriptions of some realities of Heaven. This revelation of Heaven given to the young Marietta also contains an impressing description of the work of Jesus on the cross and the spiritual realities involved. This reading is a real blessing and needs to be rediscovered.
4,Good Book,This is an interesting book but there is mostly accounts of the spirits of infants as they reach heavenly realms.
2,misleading title,"This is mostly a mediation on the life of Christ from standpoint of the angels, with some dreamlike experiences of what happens to babies in heaven."
1,"Many, many errors","There are literally dozens of errors in this dictionary. ""Banner year"" is translated literally as ""año insignia,"" which is nonsense in Spanish. ""Mover and shaker"" is also translated literally (""promotor e impulsor""). It's as though the author didn't understand English! Other absurdities are ""herein"" (aquí dentro--should be ""en el presente""), hereunder (más abajo--should be ""conforme al presente""), etc. Again, these are literal translations that do not fit in business or legal writing. ""Judicial notice"" which is actually ""reconocimiento de hechos notorios"" is translated as citación judicial--again, complete lack of understanding of the term. I'd stay away from this one like the plague."
4,Excellent read,"Tom Ward has given the Christian community a very strong view of the Bibles truths in his book,""Outposts of Hell or Portals to Heaven."" He tells of his firm beliefs and experiences where so called ""christian believer's"" have let the Word of God go slack in their teachings and reflections. How not being knowledgable to God's commands has brought about destruction to todays society. It is not a new thing which is happening in society, but something in which we, as devoted Christian's, should look at. We have let to many things go under the bridge of our religious faith and now is the time for the true Christian Believers to take a stand for what we believe. Tom Ward has done this! Straight to the point and full of Biblical truths, Tom's book will open your eyes to new understandings of how we can bring help to a lost world.Daryl Worcesterwww.publishedauthors.net/darylworcester"
5,A Must Read!!,"It is my opinion that Tom Ward's ""Outposts of Hell or Portals to Heaven"" should be something every Christian reads. This book gives insight into many things that we as Christians have overlooked or became used to in our spiritual walks. ""Outposts of Hell or Portals to Heaven"" is an eye opener and a true reality check. As I read each page, it made me realize things I myself had seen in the church and ignored or trusted to be true. We as Christians, need to wake up and take a look at who we are, and what God wants us to be. This book is a perfect tool for that spiritual walk, for it makes us more aware of things we tend to just believe because someone of the church told us. We must be the ones to research and understand what we are being taught. Outstanding book and a true must read!Candice M. Martin, author""Petals of Life: A Survivor's Writings"""
5,As Good As It Gets,"Though not written in Alexander Pushkin's native Russian, this edition of his immortal classic ""Eugene Onegin"" is as near to perfection as it could possibly be. This particular translation is eloquent and full of the lighthearted humor and poetry that I believe to be an integral part of Pushkin himself. Yet the novel in poetry is also able to evoke a melancholy sadness, and it leaves the reader with feelings that aren't easily shaken."
5,vol 4,I watched them when they came on disney.. and my neice like them too.. Going though the teen years is not easy for anyone but we get to see with 3 or 4 friends of Lizzie's as well as Lizzie teen years..
3,FAVORITE CELEB,I LIKE TV SHOWS OF HILARY DUFFSHE ALWAYS KEEPS ME HAPPYFRIENDS OF MINE ARE IN LOVEWITH HER
2,No Substitute for a Class,"The video is OK as a video. It does use older people to model the moves but there are two problems. First, you can see the instructor making corrections to hand positions and posture for the demonstrators. You, of course, can't get any of that. Also, some of the moves are complicated and difficult for older people to do on their own. My suggestion - spend the money toward a live course."
3,Tai Chi DVD,"I was impressed with the movements in this dvd but through the training portion of the dvd it is very, very, very slow. I understand that this is for older adults, but my elderly folks in the retirement community that I am employed, were bored to tears. We ended up using our old Tai Chi VHS tape that we had been using from another company. We have yet to go back to this dvd."
2,I am alone in not liking this book...,"Sorry but I just do not get this book. It was very difficult to keep reading this book. It just started slowly and meandered around and it never really connected all the dots. As the book itself says on page 294- ""what was the point"" - ""cut to the chase"" or ""make the pitch"" in talking about a scene on televsion. That was exactly how I felt about the book - what was the point? The book never really explains about Ronan, Phemie and Ashley the granddaughter. It never was tied up and explained in a nice package and even thought it was fantasy - it should have tied up all the lose ends. It never did and all the constant excerpts that talk about apples and celtic lore - incredibly tedious and did not add to the story at all. This author is really not something I will seek out in the future."
3,This is a movie just waiting to happen!,"In the hands of the right director, this book could become a lovely, magical romance along the lines of ""Practical Magic."" In book form, the myth of the Apple Island overshadows the cast of characters (the one shining exception to this is Kathleen, the librarian). And the ""encounter"" between Ashley and Ronan was awkward and puzzling, happening out of sync with the pace of the story. Not to mention unnecessary...the sexual tension the author built during the first part of the story intrigued me much more that any actual dalliance could have.The redeeming quality of the book, and the reason I gave it 3 stars, was the lovely way the author wove the legend and the present day together. Her descriptions of landscape and architecture were vivid and enchanting, a lovely picture painted with words. I would recommend it for light reading...and have my fingers crossed that some visionary Hollywood producer can see the cinematic potential here!"
2,Toys,this hefty tome covers the lower end of the market with nothing much for the serious collector of quality models.
5,Ecco is the best,Good price for these shoes on Amazon. These are worth every penny. The most comfortbale shoes I have ever had.
3,Misclassification,I was very impressed with this product until it was realized the size requested was not what was sent too me. When ordering it was noted EU44 (10 - 10.5 US) When received it was observed the shoe was too big. Looking up on-line what EU44 was it was discovered that EU44 is actually 12 - 13.5 US.
1,Horrible smelling...ruined my hair yet did not work!,"I bought the entire line of red enhancing John Freida products including shampoo, conditioner and glaze. After using these products for 2 weeks, my highlights still weren't evenly tinted plus my hair was probably in the worst condition it has ever been in! I switched back to Kerastase products and included Ted Gibson conditioner in captivating copper, which I use by adding a small amount to my Kerastase condtioner. Wow, no comparison! My hair is looking great again and the TG keeps the highlights beautifully tinted even though I only add it to my conditioner twice per week! I had initially skipped over the TG and went for the JF because of reviews and price but in the end I wasted my money on the JF products which are some of the worst I have ever used! The TG colored conditioner is by far less costly since it works so well and I use a very small amount only twice per week. The bottle will probably last me at least 6 months to a year."
3,Could be better,"Many people say this product can make your hair look greasy but you just need to wash it out really well....Im not sure how others finally got the greasy look to wash out because I certainly couldn't. While it sounds like a great product in theory, I wish the greasy aspect could be fixed."
2,Not what I expected,"I received this product and was excited to use it. Upon opening the box, I noticed that there was a very strong smell. When I took the bottle out of the box, I noticed some red on the bottle. It smelled and looked as if it might have been opened and used previously. About a 1/4 of the bottle was gone. I proceeded to use the product on my hair as directed. I left it on longer than the bottle said because I did read online reviews that said that it worked better if that was done. When I dried my hair, it was a little brighter, but only on the ends. It did absolutely NOTHING for the roots that were showing. I would not use this again. The bronze hair mascara I purchased for $3.00 did much more."
2,product has changed,I used to use the Radiant Red Luminous Color Glaze a couple times a week and loved the results. Then I couldn't find it in any stores in my area anymore. When I stumbled upon it at Amazon I purchased two bottles. Perhaps they have changed the formula. When I use it now it makes my hair look dirty/greasy. It is not at all the result I used to get with beautiful color and shiny hair. I can only use it on the weekend when I am not going to see anyone. I don't even want the other bottle but don't know what to do with it.
1,Doesn't Work.,"Dont waste your money on this product. Or anything from this seller. When I got my bottle it had been half USED! It said it was brand new and unopened. The product didnt work anyways. All I can say is it made my hair extremely dry and gave me split ends, and didnt do ANYTHING AT ALL to help my color."
4,Good enough for me to look for it online,"To my dismay, local drug stores recently stopped carrying my ""red hair goo."" I was delighted to find it online. I ordered 3, and even with shipping paid less than I used to in stores.The product itself takes a little practice. You really do have to follow the directions (shampoo and condition first); I do all that at the beginning of my shower, add the glaze on leg-shaving days so it's on there longer, and rinse at the end.You have to rinse a LOT to get it all out, or your hair looks greasy. On a busy day, this is easily remedied by working talcum powder into your hair. The next shampoo will take care of it.This glaze is non-damaging and gives my cool-toned medium brown hair just enough spice. I'm extremely frugal and never dreamed of paying more than [...] bucks for anything that goes on my hair, but I keep coming back for more!"
5,John Freida Hair Products,"This red color glaze is the best product I have found in years. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I can go 3 months between salon coloring with this product, colors the roots, keeps my hair the same color constantly. I love it......"
3,Hard to read because of outdated language and symbols,"Incomplete sentences, outdated language and symbols , make this book hard to read. I am going to plough through it. I have found new insights into the life of the Pilgrims from all the delays to set sail to faulty boats to unscrupulous Captains and boat owners. It causesme to wonder at the Pilgrim's zeal to actually carry this voyage through. I'm grateful they did and it does get easier as you get accustomed (somewhat) to the sentence structure. I'm wondering why this isn't a less expensive book. Guess I'm spoiled by all the wonderful free historic books I've downloaded."
1,Poor quality,This item arrived and the handle was all bent. I wanted it for father's day and now i don't have time to get a replacement. The quality is very poor for the price.
3,UNHAPPY,I opend the box to find that the cover had been damaged. I phoned UPS and reported the problem. They aked me what I paid and said they would send someone in 3-5 days to view the product. They stated they would reimburse me for the amount if they found it was damaged.No one ever came.I phoned UPS and was told that the check was being sent to the shipper and they would send me the check. I never thought I would be taken on an order placed through AMAZON.COM
1,Granite Steamer,The shipping box was not damaged when it arrived. When we opened the box and removed the product we found a large dent in the bottom corner.I have since returned the product.
1,Damaged,"When I received the package, the box was in fine condition. The pot itself however was dented and the paint was chipping off. Based on this and many other reviews read where people had the same experience, I returned the pot and did not ask for a replacement."
1,Burnt Washers,"Granite Ware 3-Piece 19-Quart Decorated Clam and Lobster Steamer with faucetI cooked once using this product, and was very happy with the results - until some small overheating caused the washers in the faucet to melt. It now sits unusable, until I can find replacement washers (they are ""specialty"" and not available at your friendly neighborhood hardware store)."
4,Lobster/Clam Steamer,"Works great, but as with all Enamel-on-steel cookware exercise caution as the enamel chips easily. I always keep a bottle of enamel chip touchup on hand (available at Home Depot & Lowe's) in case the pot gets dinged. Once you open the touchup it only stays usable for awhile so it will need to be replaced occasionally."
5,Extremely Inspiring,"Regardless you are a fan of UFO Robot Grendizer or not ,this audio CD is a perfect masterpiece with it's 13 Tracks .The sound is so clear .And it moves you with the symphonies variation whether it is calm or dramatic it always snatch you from your mood and let you dream a bit..... Get it as soon as you can..."
3,Wing over the Arctic,"This book is a great way to glimpse the nationalist view of Mother Russia of the 1930s and 1940s. You just have to can get past the ""my dear comrade"" perspective. Given that, it is a good choice for studying the history of aviation in the Russian Arctic."
5,An exceedingly readable history of Irish Americans and two powerful families,"Dr. Goodwin writes wonderfully about American politics, the Irish Catholic immigration and integration into the polical landscape of Boston, and two families, both with terrific strengths and well noted weaknesses. The writing on Rose Fitzgerald and Joe Kennedy, Sr are particularly good. One gets a visceral feel of destiny as the desire to succeed, almost at any cost, throughout her well researched and written work. Much has been written about ""plagarism"" or a lack of proper footnoting (corrected in the paperback edition). I would encourage all potential readers to not allow such an unfortunate circumstance in her many years of teaching and writing to get in the way of reading this important piece of U.S. history. This book is a well researched and incredibly well written and readable account of immigration, politics and the rise of 19th Century immigrant families to economic, social and political prominence."
3,The Kennedy's and the Fitzgeralds,"Ms. Goodwin is a tallented writer and historian, in that the book has well documented sources, and provides an interesting glymse into rise of this prominant family.However Ms. Goodwin sometimes gets a bit too mushy for my taste particulary in some of the chapters covering the Fitzgeralds. Secondly her unwaivering support for the Family(The Kennedy's primarily) Get in the way of objectivity particularily in reveiling the misdeeds of Josepth and Jack Kennedy.In general a great book which is throughly written and a must read for those wanting to known more about this significant family."
5,excellent,"Another book I bought for my wife's birthday from Amazon. My wife is an ardent reader and enjoys Doris Kearns Goodwin. My wife loves to read about all different types of people. In fact she is on the back porch now reading a book. This book was in excellent shape and the supplier shipped the book right away, and for a reasonable price.Thank You, William D. English"
2,to catch a thief,"I enjoyed this book, but also felt the author is a little to close to the subject, and has not much objectivity. Also, I think, being it's a book about the Fitzgeralds, she should have cribbed a few passages from The Great Gatsby. I would loved to have been reading about old Papa Kennedy conning Gloria Swanson, and discovered he had ""temporarily lost interest in the abortve sorrows and short winded elations of men."" If you're going to steal, Doris, might as well go the whole hog."
3,The Saga of an American family,"Doris Kearns Goodwin always pleases, but as I read this saga, I really wondered about the character of the characters."
1,Dont waste your money.,"I have bough over a dozen helmets from 6 or so manufactureres in the last 10 yrs. This is the WORST one. Graphic may look cool, but this thing is so cheaply made, NOT SNELL approved, I wont wear it because I am fearful of my safety in it. Nothing but a dust collector. I should have known by the price!"
2,Another gem from Prometheus books,"I had just made(barely) my high school tennis team and after swaggering down to the courts discovered a young women with a box of balls hitting serves. I asked if she would like to play a set, but she politely declined. Being a bit miffed I said something about taking it easy on her at which point she said ""ok"". Not only did I forget to win a game, but only scored two points in the set. The lady's name was Janet Hoppes and was at that time ranked 3rd in the world. It's for this reason I have some sympathy for the author. Though I only got as far as the first chapter, on William James, this is even more of a mismatch then my tennis experience. Even with the advantage that James can't reply, and that the author can pick his spots to quote out of context it's still painfull to read such illiterate blather. If you want a critique of James go to Santayana or Russell. I do applaud Prometheus Books for making a place for semi retarded authors in publishing."
2,Could've been much better...,"I like the premise of the book (dissecting the arguments of Christian apologists). But the bitterness and bile simply made this book unreadable for me. Hitchens was a writer who could forcefully argue atheism but did so with wry, witty ripostes - by contrast Joshi's attacks are ascerbic. I've read almost a score of books arguing for atheism and this is the first one I've been unable to finish."
5,A clear but brutal attack on God's defenders,I was looking for a writer that explained the atheist position clearly and logically. I especially enjoyed the Introduction and Conclusion as providing a concise description of the problems with religion. Yes he could have been more diplomatic but when you're telling people the emperor has no clothes you will offend people. And if you shout it out loud and point out they have been fooled you may really upset them.
3,External Drive Device,"This external hard drive power supply/interface works fairly well. Some people have complained about overheating with these type devices, a problem I have not noticed. However, my use is not intensive. I use this device as solely a backup drive so it is not accessed on a frequent basis. It comes ""on"" (spins) every time the computer is awakened, and then ""powers down"" (stops spinning the hard drive) to a ready mode in about a minute if not accessed. My only complaint was that I had to reposition (bend) some of the plug in connections on the internal PC board to make them accessible thru the case in order to make the device useable. Other than that it seems to work well for me."
1,There goes being hopeful,"First, the provided screw driver was the wrong size (too small) and stripped the screws just trying to open the case.Second, it just doesn't work. After installing the HDD (and trying multiple jumper settings) nothing happens when I power it on. The Power LED turns on, but the HDD never spins even once. I'll find a better quality product somewhere else."
2,clunky design,"This is not a very well designed unit. I guess you get what you pay for. It uses archaic power connectors with pins that can bend easily, and little bitty screws that are easy to loose. Granded, the thing did work, but the light was on the back so you couldn't tell if the unit was on or off. I'll look elsewhere for my next case."
4,Much better than I thought it would be.,"Most external hard drive enclosures don't hold a candle to this one. For being so cheap, the aluminum architecture is surprisingly well made and drives are easy to install. The only slight detraction is that the lights are on the same side as the ports, making it slightly more difficult to position on a table if you want to see them.. I am impressed enough, however, that I have another on the way."
3,"ok, for the price","The product works but has an annoying feature when you first turn it on: The OS (XP) goes into autoplay mode and tries to read the content of every drive in the enclosure (the drive in the enclosure is partitioned into 3 drives). I have tried to turn off autoplay for that drive but that did not help. This takes about 30 secs or more. I have a different enclosure which does not do the same. Other than that, the drive functions ok, though I have not put it through any rigorous tests."
4,it works,Product works fine. No drivers needed for Windows Vista. Make sure you use your own screwdriver instead of the little worthless thing they include. Plus you really have to bend the connection cable to get everything to fit together.
5,Works Well,"I have had no issues with my hard drive enclosure. The product has been turned on and off many times through out the day and shows no signs of failure. As another user mentioned, it would be nice if the LEDs were on the front instead of the back, but that doesn't affect the performance by any means. FYI-The power is supplied by an adapter and not by USB incase you missed that part. There is no software to install and it works flawlessly for Windows and automounted on most linux distros.Overall-I am very satisfied with this product."
3,Screws were way too tight,"Everything seemed fine, but they included the wrong size screwdriver, for one. Then when I used another one that actually fitted, half of the screws on the case were so tightly screwed in that I ended up stripping them irreparably.Everything else was fine, I hope that my problem was a exception, but still, disappointing."
5,"Easy to set up, works perfectly.","It took me 13 minutes from the time I took the product out of the box to installing my old hard drive in the enclosure and plugging it into my USB port. I was in a spot because my motherboard had died on my old pc, and my new pc didn't was incompatible with the old IDE hard drives (SATA only). With the CoolMax hard drive enclosure, I easily converted my internal IDE hard drive to a USB external hard drive. All of the data on my old hard drive is now available whenever I need it. I only plug in the Coolmax when I need to recover random bits of data I forgot to transfer from my old drive, and it's ready to go whenever I need it. A very effective, reasonably priced product that works!"
4,No problems here,Other reviews are mixed about this product. I had no trouble getting my old drive in this at all. It is possible to strip the screws if you are not careful. The provided screw driver is of course not intended to be top quality. But this works just fine for me. I have no complaints.
1,Tech Support: Use a Table Fan...,"I've gone through two in the past 4 months. The third is on its way and is heading straight to the garbage bin....Their tech support is hard to get to, I had to leave messages threatening to write to my state's attorney general to get them to respond. They finally inspected the 2nd dead one and said it was a heat issue. I have the units out in the open, and my Seagate unit does just fine. He suggested that I setup a table fan blowing over the hard drive. No Thanks, I'll stick to a trusted brand for something as important as my backup data."
2,Worked well... until it died,"I bought one of this model enclosures from a local company. The first one was damaged out of the box, so I took it back for an exchange. The second worked great for about six months until it died. I wouldn't recommend."
4,It works,"Very compact, just a bit tight on fit for the drive. A small cooling fan or small vents would be a good addition for someone who wants to work the drive hard."
1,Worked great... while it worked,"What can I say, this product was a piece of cake to set up. I installed the HDD, plugged in the power and USB cables, and the drive came up immediately for formatting. It worked flawlessly for 4 months. Then one day, it didn't. It powers up, the drive spins, but doesn't mount. I tried 2 different HDD that I know work (used in other external enclosures of a different brand), and they didn't mount either. So off with it to the electronics recycler, and off for me to buy a new enclosure, ...of a different brand. I give it 1 star for dying in only 4 months, but I could give it half a star more for being so easy to set up."
1,This External Enclosure did not last very long,I have bought many of these external enclosures for my old IDE drives. Many of them simply die like this one this. The external enclosure by I/O magic has been the longest lasting for me.
1,Simple solution to a chronic problem,"Picked this unit up at the recomendation of my computer repair guy.It allows me to quickly install any standard sized hard drive and use it like a giant thumb drive. Install of the HD ( salvaged from my last computer) was slick and took all of 2 min with 4 screws and 2 cable connections. It's great for routinely backing up old files ( just in case). It's also great for retieving files and programs from your old computer when it's time to upgrade. Just pull your old HD and install it in this device and see it all when you plug in the USB. What I like is that becasue it's only connected (via switched USB) when you want, it's easier to protect from a virus/ intruder. Great security and peace of mind for the $."
3,First One Stopped Working,The first enclosure stopped working after 6 months of use. Sent it back to CoolMax for replacement. Replacment has been fine for over a year now. The base for it sucks. Enclosure is flat on one side so no need to use the base anyway.
1,Good for about a year ...,"I bought this when I bought a new computer system so I could easily access the hard drive from the old computer. Once I figured out the correct jumper setting for the drive (set the drive for ""Cable Select""), it worked fine for about a year. Now, it powers up, the drive spins up, and the computer will recognize it as a USB device, but it can't access the drive at all. No data, no volume information, nothing. I installed the drive into a PC, and the drive works fine, so the problem is clearly this enclosure."
4,good quality enclosure,installation wasnt difficult i got up and running within 10minutes..it keeps the drive cool inside since it is aluminum so no problems so far with this
1,"Garbage, lasted 3 months","I bought this to replace an HD enclosure that failed for my mother-in-law. It lasted less than 3 months. Can't say I'm completely surprised, for $25 you get what you pay for.Spend $50 and get a better quality enclosure, Antec's are nice."
1,Power Supply Died,"This unit worked fine for about three weeks and then the brick power supply died. I see other reviews with the ""dieing"" issue.I am attempting to get it replaced now...Just an fyi....."
3,Good reference for different techniques,"Although was not exactly what I expected, it is a good reference for explaining different methods, good price and good addition for my library"
5,good,my son really likes this toy. i think it is good educationally because he learned about it in science. i started playing with itAMAZON
5,boot to the head,"Tank shows Hugo Duarte what a 'bully' he is in 60 seconds. That'll probably be the last time that someone whose biggest credential is 'beat Harold Howard' shoots his mouth off about Tank. Incredibly close middleweight tournament. Three out of four are some of the top fighters in the world; Dan Henderson, Allen Goes, and Carlos Newton. Newton is incredible to watch. He should have won the tournament, but Henderson deserved it for coming back out after his war with Goes. Story of the night though was Pete Williams versus Mark Coleman. Watch in slow motion after Coleman gets knocked out. Then watch it again. Enjoy!"
5,Into his soul,"Traks:1 Will You Be There (edit)2 Man In The Mirror3 Girlfriend4 Will You Be ThereA very very nice cd. Yes, it came out in the early Nineties and you can see the `old' conception. You just get tracks available elsewhere in the same version (where newer cd offer different versions of the same song, or remixes), but I like the ones in here. I think they go perfectly together. They are akin to each other.You get the radio edit of `Will You Be There', where the long intro has been edited (anyway, you get it in the last track). `Man In The Mirror' is one of my favourite MJ song, and I think it goes perfectly with `Will You Be There' even if it belongs to a different album and a different moment in MJ's creative life. The same feeling resonates in both of them, in a way. They seem to me some of the more introspective songs MJ ever sang.`Girlfiend' is not a favourite of mine, but it's definitely enjoyable. Young and light."
2,Yawnfest,"Though her grasp of nuance and language is considerable, the nature of her characters' internal dialogue is exhausting. I found her work to be bland and self-indulgent, infused with a sort of housewife's profundity. Plus, the image on the front cover did nothing to dissuade the notion that her narratives are the worst sort of ""poor me-esque"" weepy writing."
4,IF KOKO LIKES IT SO DO I,"Very interesting mixture of music. Koko has good taste ! Some of the music makes you want to dance and some just mellow out. It's perfect for us primates.................hairy and naked alike. KOKO - YOU KNOW YOUR MUSIC BUT ""Watch out for that Alligator ! "" Get this CD - you won't be disappointed. It's great for primary school - and would go great with a book or two on Koko."
3,Nothing special.,"Dolph Lundgren tackles the problem of land mines in this fairly amatuerish,predictable effort.Passenger 57 baddie Bruce Payne pops up as...er,the baddie."
1,You get what you pay for,The arm cups are flimsy and way to flexible. I can't even use one of them at all because I need the cup to hold it's form. Lesson Learned.
3,Good Voice-Nice Performances-Songs Weak Link,"She seems to have a fine voice and gives a fine vocal performance for every song. The production is good - not too cluttered or over-produced, letting her voice be front & center but the songs thenselves are non-descript with weak lyrics. The backing music is either weak crunk or generic dance pop drum beats.The best tracks are the few pop-dance tracks that veer into Michelle Branch territory where her vocals and emotions get to shine like SKIN DEEP or CHASING LOVE."
2,Gone already...,I got this for Christmas and it already fell off the cord and is GONE! It was VERY cute.
1,Boring movie that defends the idiots of the world,"The movie promised a balanced report on animal activists but did not do so. Instead, the movie shows all the different factions of animal activists, and allows them to share their propaganda and then sticks around for uninteresting anecdotes about dull people.The movie was poorly produced and full of redundancies. You know the ones that take 10 minutes to make a 2-minute point and then regurgitate that same point throughout the movie...Regardless of your views on the topic, you would be much better served watching a handful of YouTube videos and save your money."
2,So many typos are insult to this great play!,"I purchased this copy here, at Amazon for my Modern American Drama class. When I opened the book, I was like ""ok, looks good"", but when I started reading it, it was plagued with so much typos that it looks like a 13 year old could have typed this. I don't recommend buying this copy, buy it from another publisher or something. The play was good but the publisher did a horrible job with the typing. Be Warned!"
1,Poor printing of a great play - Beyond The Horizon,"The printing of the play must have been done by an elementary school shop class. There were: run-on sentances and paragraphs, mis-spells, no separation between 'character speak' and stage directions - to mention a few. A total waste to money."
1,Beyond Horizon,"The play was not written at all the way it was originally. There is no distinction between speakers and the dialogue is completely mixed and jumbled up so it is hard to follow the story. If you had mentioned in the product description that it was written this way, I would not have bought it. I wasn't satisfied with this product."
4,Glorious return of true Death 'n Roll,"The sound and feel is largely a continuation of Uprising and Inferno, and we couldn't ask for anything better. Some of the higher-grade riffage of old Entombed harkening back to Left Hand Path is even present, but augmented by the timeless lo-fi garage-y nature of Entombed's sound of late. Crank it up and enjoy the gritty, rumbling mess."
5,"It's Just A Sticker,Or Is It?","Motorhead, circa 1983,that glorious year when Fast Eddie was fulltime in his own group, and Lemmy was left with Philthy Phil. Robbo was ibcorporated into the fold at this point, Robbie Robertson guitarist from Thin Lizzy, etc....I have always thought this to be rthe definitive Motorhead album, and the cover's art work, some of the groups finest to date. Why not immortalize this classic metal release from 1983 on a sticker? Therefore, my purchase of this fine looking sticker. It looks nifty, and sticks well, ha!!"
4,Great book on the history of Key West . . .,". . . but it is not a quick read. If you are interested in something other than partying on Duval Street, then when you encounter snippets of the past (perhaps at a museum or Dry Tortugas), it will be for the second time."
2,history at its driest,"I bought this in preparation for my first trip to Key West based on the excellent reviews. Well, it did contain a lot of possible facts. I say ""possible"" because the author's citations were almost all secondary and tertiary sources. (real historians are cringing now) The prose are as dry and monotonous as desert sand. This reminds me more than anything of my middle school history textbooks. Try another source."
4,"Yep, MONO is making a comeback!!","If you miss the good old days here's one for you - the entire singles collection of Messrs Becker and Bates (brilliant band, by the way) mastered in glorious MONO! OK, except the very last track 'Catch Me'. But the remainder is enough nostalgia for anyone stuck in that memorable period. Well done, Cherry Red!!However, if you are into good old boring stereo, most of these tracks can be found on the individual cd album releases - Photographs as Memories (Avenue With Trees), Pale Hands I Loved So Well, Kodak Ghosts Run Amok... For a ""Best of"", you might want to check out 'Voice'.."
1,These don't stay put at all (choose stretchy covers instead),"As with most slipcovers, these do not stay tucked at all. They wrinkle like crazy and must be adjusted constantly in order to look decent. They were taking over my life, as I felt the need to re-tuck them in every time I got up off the couch. I have even tried building pvc frames to hold them in place like I had read to do somewhere. This was probably better than not having them, but not doing the job. We finally gave up on them and bought the stretchy kind, which are MUCH better. Not perfect, but much better at staying in place. I would recommend just getting stretchy covers in the first place."
5,Excellent Big Band Music,"I have this album on the 1968 RCA/Camden pressing. I can't vouch for the transfer to CD or the remastering but if you like Glenn Miller, this is a mandatory addition to your music collection. Great songs and great performances. Tex Beneke really shines here."
5,It works!,"I have 2. It keeps a set of balls I've been playing with surprisingly playable for a long time. They look bad, but they bounce almost like new.I took a 2 month break and the pressure was lost, so you probably need to re-pressurize every couple weeks."
4,good for beginners,"Works well but once you get good enough to bang the ball with heavy topspin, you pretty much will need to use new tennis balls every time you play. You should notice this when you start to see the fibers coming off the ball especially when you are serving. I play 2-3 sets 2-3 times a week and stopped using this after about 2 years. I am probably a 4.0-4.5 now, up from a 3.0 when I started.If you are not hitting the ball very hard this will save you a lot of money on tennis balls."
4,Great product,Keeps the tennis balls lively for quite a long time. The fuzz of the ball will wear out before the balls go dead.
4,Theory of product is sound. Time will reveal value and length of maintaining pressure,"Unable to provide a definitive rating, since I just received. Only drawback thus far is having to turn or screw on top. Perhaps difficult for those who have arthritic hands. Ultimately, the goal is to maintain extended ball pressure"
5,Great product,I have been using this same ball saver for years and it works great. It puts used tennis balls back into a vacuum for lively use again. I bought 6 new ball savers and gave them as gifts this past holiday season.
3,Yes and No,"This product is a little misleading. They should change the name to ""extending new tennis ball's life"". Once the ball lost interal pressure, you can't restore it like new to even close to it. This product does ""seem"" to help new tennis balls last longer after it's been open from a new can...provided that you place the new balls into this canister after each play."
1,DOES NOT DELIVER WHAT IS EXPECTED,"Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong. Maybe, I said maybe, it can hold the pressure of the balls for a little longer. But it won't revigorate dead balls. Disappointed."
1,Tennis Ball Destroyer,"This product does not work. I kept 3 tennis balls inside the ""Tennis Ball Saver"" for 4 weeks to see if the pressure would be maintained. After that, I got them out and started playing with them and all three balls went dead while warming up. Do not buy this product as it does not work as advertised."
4,Pretty Good,"It does what it says it does - it will keep balls pressurized and in better condition than would otherwise be possible.Just keep three of your balls in here, and they are sure to last longer. Good product"
4,Great Product!! Buy two.,"I already had one tennis ball saver, and I use it all the time. It does a great job keeping the balls from becoming flat. I usually use six balls when I play tennis though, so it's even better now that I have two tennis ball savers. I like that it's simple to use and lasts a long time! A+."
3,Probably works for the age group,"Girl gets wishes granted, but then regrets them and learns to appreciate her life. It's a pretty old story and has been reused in hundreds of teen girl movies. Still, 16 Wishes isn't a bad retake for the intended audience. It's a bit unrealistic and tough to suspend disbelief during some scenes (like when the girl suddenly becomes an adult). A bit more time with the script would have helped. The better moments are more of a take on Dickens' Christmas Tale. It's certainly not a classic in the genre but should entertain young girls for a while."
4,Good Movie,"I normally don't watch kids movies, but there was nothing on and so, I decided to give it a watch. I actually became a bit glued as the story really caught my attention. It's not a great film, but it's a feel good film. It definitely makes you appreciate what you have."
5,Super cute,This is one of my families favorite movies by Disney. It's funny but super cute all while teaching important life skills!
4,christmas gift,My grandaughter was delighted to get this tape she's just nine years old thanks so much for your speedy reply. D.W.
2,I won't buy this book,"Having read the other clear reviews on this book and also having browsed thru it myself, I can see that the author is probably attempting too much in trying to cover All warfare in the 18th century in this one book. He has made his task even more difficult by moving away from a Eurocentric view of global warfare. The problem of course is compounded by the fact that this would require a synopsis of warfare covering different geographical settings, different forces and logistics and different cultures. This is not achieved here.I note with interest that this series will in the future cover other non-European warfare and colonial warfare and would prefer to save my money for these more promising offerings."
3,"Good, but not great.","Good overall review of synth music artists and equipment; however, it pales greatly when compared against other books such as Julian Colbeck's ""Keyfax Omnibus Edition"" and Mark Vail's ""Vintage Synthesizers."""
2,"Basic, Commercial","I, for some reason related to my enthusiasm for the subject, was really excited to read this book. Unfortunately, it essentially reads like a compilation of promotional material about products and a number of artists. Nothing original here. If you're reading this, you obviously have an internet connection and access to much more information than is in this un-original text."
2,Outdated,The interviews in this book are several years old. If that isn't enough to turn you off the old technology will certainly do it for you. Remember the 1970's ARP and the 1980's Juno? How many readers are going to get excited about that old technology? Even the artists who were interviewed have moved on to using synths like the Nord Lead 3 and the Virus kb. Save your money and buy something else.
5,Fit Great,This alignment tool fit my 1996 K1500 5.0L. This did was it was supposed to do and came quick from Amazon.
5,Very sastisfied,I received my vaccuum cleaner very quickly and it was by far the least expensive I could find. I am very satisfied with my purchase on Amazon
1,The worse vacuum !!!,"I just want to say ""Please don't buy this vacuum"" Here is why:1. When I vacuum on hardwood floors, the dirt would shoot out from the back of the vacuum itself. Make my job twice as hard. It does not do that on carpet, though.2. It is heavy.3. The cable is short, and so I have to keep on moving it to different plug in the other room.4. It blows air everywhere and so when I tried to vacuum my golden retriever's hair I decided it's better to use a broom instead.5. It is not wide enough.You really get what you buy for a 'cheap' vacuum, don't expect much from it!!!"
4,Knickerbockers,"I remember this band from way back. ""Lies"" is one of my all time favorrite songs. The rest are good too."
3,"Good track, but not worth the price.","This was actually the very first release I heard from Current 93, along with a track they made on their collaberation with Michael Cashmore called ""The Cat is Dead"" and I was an instant fan. But I have a hard time recommending this CD because of the price you're going to pay is for only 1 song. For the music I gave it 4 stars but because of the price you have to pay for this rare import, it loses a point."
1,Inadequate Pressurization,The pressure in the can was only sufficient to expel about 1/3 of the contents. I would stick with the bottled products.
1,citri strip,i bought this item and and it did not work at all for me and smelled horrible i tried this on multiple items and it did not work i wouldn't recommend getting it if it cant stip paint form a simple metal bike frame or on wood stain no never again buying it
2,Disappointment,This camera is useless unless you are right in front of it and even then the picture is just mediocre. Definitely not usable for security purposes.
4,little camera,I like the little camera from Swann. It gives a nice video picture. I plan to use it with my Earth-Moon-Earth dish to communicate with other amateur radio opearators via signals off the moon. The camera will sit in the middle of the dish to help me point at the moon. I will also be using it to measure sun noise so have rigged up some welders glass infront of the camera to look at the sun.
2,Poor low light capture,"Overall picture is grainy so I Can't recommend this camera. Also, it performed very poorly in low light conditions for me. Had to return it."
4,'Haunted: Psychedelic Pstones 2' (Castle Music) Various Artists,"A total of 28 songs of some 'nice to have' late '60's British psych goodies. Few known bands here,like The Kinks,Status Quo and The Searchers. Along with some lesser known acts such as Marmalade,Tremeloes,Episode Six and Tuesday's Children. This is some of the best music you've NEVER heard from long bye-gone days. Fun to to listen on a rainy day."
2,Thoughts on A Calculated Magic,Sadly both A Modern Magician & it's sequel A Calculated Magic have not aged well. They both feel very 80's
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A fairly ordinary fantasy, but the fun part is the urban setting of Las Vegas, and the shenanigans that happen around there.You have Merlin, mobsters, demons, and a young mathematical typethat is needed to save everyone from very, very bad things. That, and ahardnosed woman to keep him in line, and to annoy him."
5,Gotta love this book!,"Robert Weinberg drags myths, legends, and grim fairy tales kickin' and screamin' into the present and makes his every man character find modern equivalents to old wive's tale solutions. The plot twists in ways you wouldn't anticipate and humor is spread liberally throughout. I especially liked Odin's crows plaguing the hero and his fiancee."
1,"Sick, not scary","The most frightening thing about this book is that it was written at all. I revel in all types of horror fiction, but this was one of the worst horror novels I've read. Aside from the weak structure and uninteresting characters, everything is taken to a really sick level -- not sick in a spine-tingling, fascinating way, but sick in a low-level, worst possible part of humanity way. The visual comparison would be watching someone throw up. It's just not compelling to those of us looking for multi-faceted characters and a really frightening story. There is MUCH better horror fiction out there. Don't waste your time."
2,Won't stop rusting!,"I bought this for bacon and eggs. The little egg holders tend to tip over, and the bacon press just will not stop rusting! I've owned cast iron for years, and this bacon press is the worst. I ended up having to seal it in a bag of oil for months, to fix it. I think it still adds a rust taste to the bacon.... not happy with it. Was shipped fast, but with this type of product, you don't know for months if rust is a problem. Only gave it 2 stars because it was shipped fast."
3,Ok TV,"Purchased this TV some time ago, was over priced from the get-go and purchased directly form Sony. Had issues with it from the start, would get green spots that flash which to find out are pixels that are going or gone out. Overall has a nice picture, currently used more than 4,000 hours and still going strong. A very durable TV and long lasting, making an amazing computer display when using the RGB hookup. Overall I would not recommend this model, however am satisfied with the age of of this HDTV."
4,Survival Guide,"This book is helpful in accompanying those who have found difficulties in grasping Accounting concepts/principles. The study guide is a plus, but the survival guide sites specific key notes in helping to problem-solve with greater ease. I highly recommend!!!"
4,Good and dated,"This is a very good book on wine making but it is not about current industrial wine making. If you want to know about bladder presses versus basket presses, and techniques of today, this is NOT your book. However, it does help you make good wine by hand."
1,Don't waste your $ !,Don't waste your money. This is a re-print of a book from the turn of the century. Although the principals are the same this book is way outdated.
3,Gorehouse? More Like Crap House,"With the amount of mediocre movies that exist out there in the ether, the Internet and in Public Domain, it is a wonder that Gorehouse came up with this dirty dozen. The old adage of you get what you paid for is quite true. The consumer learns from their mistakes and this purchase was one of my mistakes."
2,"..No Whiners, PA-LEEZE..!","...It's A Mill Creek Package..OVER 17 HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT..!..12 flicks at an average of 50 cents per.Collectors know what they are getting into..All you casual trash bin searchin'weekends at the box store lookin' for gold got bit..Buyer Beware..Ilike Mill Creek..sometimes they get it right, sometimes not..But always interesting..I got the complete 94 episode ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" set for $5..!.So Quit Whining..Man Up..!..Ya Git What Ya Pay For..Sometimes you hit a grand slam..!"
2,The torture is on the wrong side of the screen,"I suspect that if anyone watched all these ""cult horror classics"" one after the other, without respite, they would loose their power of speech and all their cognitive abilities. Now existing as essentially a warm blooded house plant, they would join the Pauly Shore fan club and collect Canadian pennies in an empty Flintstones vitamin bottle. Please, take steps to avoid this fate, and buy a Coen brothers movie instead."
1,Lame,"Predictably lame set of dated horror flicks that couldn't scare my grandma. For one low price. Satan's Slave was the only halfway decent picture in this DVD set. Don't waste your time watching these bad horror films. Gore Hound Greats? Where's the gore, buddy?"
3,"Low price, low quality, mild entertainment.","When you see the price, you know not to expect much. These films are squeezed onto the discs, meaning sound and video quality is poor. But, most of them are pretty old movies to begin with, so it kind of adds to the nostalgic factor. I had never heard of any of these movies and there is a reason. These are all B-movies with wooden acting and low grade production. But, they get really campy and fun in a ""cult-classic,"" ""So bad that it's good"" kind of way. With 12 movies at $3.99 (currently) you are bound to find at least a few that can hold your interest and be enjoyable. The discs are double sided and in little black sleeves, like most Mill Creek titles seem to be packaged. It's a low cost product, made cheaply and packaged cheaply. However, for four bucks, you don't have much to loose."
4,gorehouse greats collection,the movies were great to watch.it was a interestig collection of movies.the package arrived on time and excelent condition.i was looking one movie and got many
4,"Very interesting, doesn't completely follow along with book","It's been months since I've seen the program on PBS but I found this book to be very interesting and filled with detail. My complaint, minor, is that with the inevitable editing of material required by compressing three months of material into a small book or a few hours of video something is often lost. Some details in the program aren't even mentioned in the book and vice versa. I'm still waiting on my copy of the video, apparently it's on a long backorder, but I'd say get both because they make a fascinating combination."
4,Great Math Review,"I bought this book because of its ratings on Amazon, its a great catch up but its not what you need if you want to get a really high score on the ACT. I used this book primarily for its geometry review because it was the only part of the ACT I did not do really well in. The book help mego from a 20 Math Composite score to a 23, so it helped very much. I also used The Real ACT book and I found it to be much more helpful then this book. but if you need a good review from what you learned in high school this is the book for you but as far as getting higher than a 23 this is not the book for you."
4,A Good ACT Material,"This book was helpful to study with for my ACT. It gave basic, yet through tips on what the ACT covers, and it has some humor along the way. Also there are tests with answers and the reason that answer is right, which is very helpful. For the price, why not try it? My ACT actually improved 2 points.."
5,ACT 4 Dummies,"Did very well on ACT , thanks to the book.I know I wouldnt have gottten a 31 without it"
1,Hardly advanced,"I don't know what this book contains to warrant the label ""advanced"" in the title. Some of the examples are useless (i.e., a water cooler level monitor) and a lot of the diagrams are confusing. My biggest gripe is with how the code is presented: most of the time, entire pages of code are repeated just to show a few lines (sometimes only one!) that have been added since the previous listing. What a waste of paper. There are also some definitions which I felt were incorrect. For example, the author states that ""serialization allows you to store your objects as strings."" Excuse me? Did anybody do a technical review before publication? To be fair, I did find some useful info but only in chapters that didn't have any code. This book is an ""Introduction"" rather than ""Advanced"" network programming."
1,Another Bad Review,"I also bought this book for the RMI section. At first you just think the examples have mistakes, but there are so many that you get to the point that the book and authors lose ALL credibility. There are no corrections to it on the Prentice Hall site (3/29/98)."
2,"Add me to the ""disappointed"" list.","Note that the other reviewers who gave this book a favorible rating said things like ""a great intermediate introduction"", and ""excellent introduction"". Excuse me, but isn't the title of this book ""*Advanced* Java Networking""? It is so basic it really should be called ""Introductory""... I'd have no problem with it, then. Nor would I have wasted my time reading it. (Luckily, I got it from our technical library.)"
2,Dont do it. Do buy it,"This book was hard to review the only this good about it was the cover ! ! The format of the samples are bad, The samples are just bad. I did not like this book at all. Please save your money and dont buy it"
2,"good series, bad book","This series of books is usually quite high quality. However this one suffers from what appears to be a very rushed schedule. The RMI portion contains glaring errors; the example code doesn't compile. Also I am disturbed by the padding of this book by large repetitions of code with only minor changes. I understand that they are supposed to be instructive, but a lot of the time they simply seem to be there to make the book larger."
1,Do not waste your time if you're interested in RMI,"This book wastes a lot of words explaining RMI and how it works and proceeds to include examples that are incorrect and simply will not compile. The examples explained in the book do not match those distributed on the accompanying cd. I found the discussion on RMI callbacks confusing and could not implement using only this book. If you are experimenting with Corba using jdk1.3, this book offers no help and no examples to learn from."
1,Very poor book !,This is book is all but rich ! It does not delve into much details. E.g. JavaBeans is very badly explained ! The images and examples are very bad and poor. It seems like it was written in a hurry !
2,Dead end,"Where are the errata for this book? The published link...doesnot work. The Prentice Hall site is also unhelpful.This book claims to be ""Completely updated"", but do not take this to mean updated to Java2 v1.3"
1,Contents are dry and lack of accuracy,This book is not a advanced Java network book. It is lack of a lot technical details. Sample code of the book contains many mstakes. It is a book I do not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Not much content - - - printed on thick paper for size ? ? ?,"Annoyed in picking up this book and the author's Java Beans book to find large sections of text (10's of pages) copied and reformated from one book to the other. Original content is light for size and cost of book. Printed on thick paper, same code examples copied over and over with a few new lines of code displayed in bold in each subsequent copy, taking up a lot of the limited page 'real estate'. Coverage of topics seemed light. Not what I would expect in an ""Advanced"" book or a book carrying this price tag."
1,Definitely not worth the money,"The publishers should be ashamed of themselves for throwing together such a muddle and charging this much for it. In fairness to the author, Sridharan has a clear and lucid writing style, and does a good job of presenting an introductory survey of Java middleware, with occasional touches of humor. But there was obviously no technical review or proofreading - the book was apparently rushed to market with no quality control. Both the text and the code are riddled with typos, and the CORBA stuff here is really pseudocode-- there is no actual code you could use with a specific vendor's orb. If you need working code for JavaIDL or RMI to get started on your own real apps don't look for it here. For folks who really need accurate detailed information I'd recommend the OReilly books."
1,Don't buy it !,"I saw that this book's second edition was published in April/2000 but unfortunately the new author (Steflik, d) has just put his name on the book, 'cos as I could see in the chapter 6 the book hasn't been updated.The chapter 6 describes Java IDL as a simple IDL to Java mapping. But nowadays Java IDL is a full ORB/IIOP implementation. The examples were done using Sun's NEO and Imprise Visibroker ORBs. If the book had been updated it'd be natural to write the examples using the Java IDL CORBA implementation from JDK 1.3.Indeed, the author says :""The examples that follows was made using JDK 1.3, JDBC 2.0, and the Imprise Visibroker ORB.""I think that what the new author has done is just use the UNIX sed command like :$ sed ""s/JDK 1.1/JDK 1.3/g"" prashant'sbook.txtrodela@bigfoot.com"
3,Concrete example of missing/inaccurate content,"Chapter 5, Java RMI, Callbacks: callbacks are a tricky part of RMI usage. I was hoping that the book would be helpful...The callback example shown in the book is not on the CD. That may not be a bad thing as the code shown doesnt work. On page 148 the authors show a class that extends an interface - this is not legal java syntax. On page 149 they have class which extends the rmi.remote class. However, this is an interface and cannot be extended, only implemented.I havent ""drilled down"" to this level on the other topics, but this is a disappointment."
1,Worst,Don't buy this book. I found a lot of errors in this book. I have to make some adjustments to the examples in the book to get them compiled. I will look for other Java networking programming book.
1,SAMPLE CODE DOESN'T COMPILE!!!,"This book covers an interesting area of Java, but the author didn't bother to test ANY of his code before printing, so ""little"" things like not declaring variables before using them makes compiling the code time consumming and tedious. Not to mention I bought the book because I didn't know very much about networking, which makes correcting some of the algorithm errors very difficult. UNLESS you are bored and want to fix hours of bugs find another book."
3,Too much extranious material,"I am a java programmer interested in back end java applications, I found that the use of AWT was annoying, I don't know it, and don't want to know it. If you are familiar with java, or know awt this is a decent book, but unless you are into AWT be prepared to extract any useful information out of the examples."
1,Dont believe the hype,"This was my first C. Williamson novel after i had read a couple of good short storiesby him . Yet i gave up (for only the second time on a novel) at page 120. In summary , its all been done before and much better aswell. The writing is'nt as clever as it could be. I dont think the author was clear whether he wanted English or American characters in this. Lines swop from ""Gosh David how awful "" to ""see any action in 'Nam"". The storyline and events at time are perposterous and written out in a very 'cheap ' way. This is all a shame as i belive this man can do better. Readers of more cultured horror (King , Straub , Herbert) will find this all very low league stuff."
5,MGM'S DVD-R IS PERFECT,"If you read this, you're probably already taken by this weird gem so there's no use for more arguments about its unusual charms. You're considering buying the above DVD-R item issued by MGM? Well don't hesitate for a second. Image is clear (a revelation after the darkish VHS) and WIDESCREEN, formated for 16x9 TVs such as mine. DREAMCHILD looked just right on it. Hope it helps."
2,"Alas, unplayable","I was delighted to learn that ""Dreamchild"" was at last available on DVD. Unfortunately the product as shipped is a burn-on-demand DVD-R (I was aware of this when I placed my order) that has yet to play through on any of two DVD players (Sony, Toshiba), one Blu-ray (JVC) and two Macs (two drives apiece) without seizing up within the first twenty-five minutes. Other reviewers report satisfaction, so your own results may vary. My two-star review splits the difference between the four stars I would likely have given the viewable product, which I've not seen since shortly after its release in VHS format, and the disappointment engendered by the unplayable digital version. I might add that over the years I have viewed (for ""evaluation purposes"" only, natch) scores of home-copied titles on my set-top boxes and on my computers without incident. It was odd that an MGM-generated product couldn't meet the standard of these hand-rolled products."
3,An odd experience,"This is a very odd film about the relationship between Lewis Carroll and the child who inspired Alice. The movie moves back and forth between Alice's childhood and old age, as she remembers the past, but then it also moves into fantasies which feature the creations from Jim Henson. BTW, these are not cute little muppets. Some of the Henson creatures are characters from Alice in Wonderland, others are dark characters from Alice's fantasies. The problem is, the film sidesteps the questions about Dodgson's relationships with young girls and is mostly fiction. There is a passable subplot about a romance between Alice's assistant and a reporter.This is not a movie I will probably ever want to watch again, and I'm sorry that I bought it."
2,A disappointing melange.,"If you are expecting to see long sequences of Jim Hensons's adorable creatures, or are desirous of recapturing the innocence of youth go somewhere else. This is a very dark story of an aging and bewildered old woman sleep-walking through the fast paced world of early 20th century New York. Its only redeeming value lies in its 19th century flash-backs, which are poorly developed and integrated into the story, and a truly heart-warming ending."
2,hmmmm...,"This is a very frustrating film. You want to like it so much, and there IS much to like, but so many more things to get queasy about. Jim Henson's very disturbing creatures are a delight to watch, but very short-lived in the film. The story is an enduring one, but there are tragic flaws. This film seems to be subtly about the pediphile nature of Lewis Caroll, but it is too subtle to where it loses it's effectivness. The love story is contrived and pointless filler. however, there are enough interesting scenes to make it worth seeing, and it is not a complete failure."
2,Edited to please the masses:,"If you have done any research on Charles Dodgson and/or the history behind Alice in Wonderland, be prepared for a disappointment. This film takes liberties on the story behind Alice in Wonderland, and conveniently side-steps more information than it gives. Historical fiction pains me as I am sure many come away with the idea that they are now informed, when in reality they have only been shown an opinionated glimpse of the 'more interesting than this movie' history."
5,Dream Child: A Dream of a Movie,Dream Child is so much more than a filmed version of Alice in Wonderland. It is a moving testament as to how much Lewis Carroll loved Alice in the most platonic way. The Wonderland characters were vividly portrayed; I only wish that a complete version of Alice in Wonderland had been produced using these and other Wonderland characters. It would have been the greatest version yet.
4,Jim henson does alice in wonderland,"This film is one of my favorites of all time. An avid Lewis C./Alice in Wonderland fan, this film has all the elements of brilliance. The story is dark, Jim Henson does some of his best work ever, and the acting (especially by Ian Holm) is superb. It is an older film, and thus the special effects and such are not up to todays standards, but the story itself is timeless, and Henson and his workshop did a flawless job of bringing their characters to life. Highly recommended."
5,Courts tipping balance of power.,Highly recommended reading. With an open mind to examine evidence one can only conclude that the courts are destroying balance of powers that was built into our govenment by the founding fathers. The use of courts to change laws makes voting of less value because courts can override the voters decisions. Every man 1 vote is powerless if 9 judges can overide it.
3,Contains Some Needed History,"Pat Robertson can sometimes be a bit heavy handed when he's writing an opinion piece. I found this book to be one sided, of course, but I didn't disagree with the side he's on at all. The author gives plenty of evidence indicating the court has in the past and seems to be continuing to use nebulous grounds for many of their rulings. I encourage conservatives to read this book if for no other reason than to get a bit of history on many of the rulings that have gotten us to the point we are today."
3,"Informative, thought provoking","Though I certainly don't agree with everything Robertson says, this book has a lot of good points. Although I disagree with him about the Brown and Miranda decisions, the historical examples given leave no doubt that America was inteneded to be a Christian nation. One other possible flaw is that Robertson tends to repeat himself a lot in the book. This book is a wake-up call for people to get involved in thier government. If the people don't stand up for themselves, who will?"
1,Puh-lease,Pat Robertson is a nut job and anyone who doesn't realize that is either stupid or as nuts as he is.
1,Instructions: 1. open mouth. 2. insert foot.,"On Sunday morning, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson told TV viewers nation-wide that the threat posed by liberal judges is ""probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings."" When an incredulous George Stephanopoulos asked if Robertson really believed that these judges posed ""the most serious threat America has faced in nearly 400 years of history, more serious than al Qaeda, more serious than Nazi Germany and Japan, more serious than the Civil War?,"" he responded, ""George, I really believe that."""
1,Evil,"Do you know your ""Commandments"" sir? Thou shalt not kill? Apparently issuing a fatwa-decree calling for the assassination of a head of state stirs no conflict with this pitiful excuse for a ""human being"". It's people like this who would beat the drums for a new Holocaust - one for those who do not believe as he does. What makes him any different than the fanatics in Arab countries who chop peoples heads and hands off? Only the time it takes to get people used to idea in the U.S. Oh, and he wears a suit and tie."
5,INTERESTING READ,"many years ago the supreme court judges gave themselves power over congressional law, judges continue to tear america down with power that should belong to the PEOPLE OF THE USA.....PAT HAS A KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS OF THE ABUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT (AND OTHER FEDERAL JUDGES)..CONGRESS CAN PUT A STOP TO THIS............................"
1,Pat should stick to...,"running his slaves in the diamond mines. This so-called christian writes a book slamming ""activist"" judges on the Supreme Court, yet had no problem when they installed a conservative president into office.People need to wake up and realize that the judiciary system is basically the only thing keeping us from becoming a police state run by a tin-pot dictator."
3,Helpful but hard to understand.,"I find Marie Ryst's ""Handmade Books and Albums: An Indtroduction to Creative Bookbinding"", very creative and absolutely beautiful. But I believe the word ""Introduction"" in the title is somewhat misleading. I am a complete novice in this area, and was looking for a good beginners book, but the instructions in this one, were somewhat over my head. Maybe after working out of a clearer ""beginners"" book, Ms. Ryst's will be of more help. The photos are lovely and show great imagination, so I'm sure it will be a good springboard for creativity once I understand the verbage better."
4,Idiomatic and expressive Scriabin,"Mr. Ponti reached a high peak with these set of Scriabin Sonatas. It's very difficult to find out the set as a whole. In this sense we must recognize the huge effort for recording these works, are decissive if you want to know the intimate world of Alexander Scriabin a passionate and troubled musician.The wide frequency of emotions covered in these Sonatas are showed by Ponti, with flowness , deep honesty an conviction.Acquire this set if you really love Scriabin piano music."
3,Great build/finish quality but not solid support,"This monopod looks great, feels great, until you put a load of 6+ lb on it. It suppose to support 11 lb, but the head is made of plastic, and you don't have solid support at Pan position. Tilt position is not much better either. I am afraid it will break at anytime.Sending it back now."
2,Wrong item in correct box,"The item in the box had twist-legs, not snap legs. The box did not appear to be tampered with. Returned it without problem. Bought same item from another vendor, same issue. Manufacturer is shipping a different model in the box! So purchase this only if you are willing to have a monopod with twist legs to adjust the height, not snap legs."
2,don't go for looks and name.,"I was excited to order this item as its name and looks were impressive and price not cheap but not expensive either. Once I received it, it looked good, but did not feel good. The leg itself is Ok, but rest is light and soft plastic that cannot be trusted with my Nikon DX series camera that are heavy. It is not sturd and I feel sooner or later it will break. I feel bad to spend $50 for something that does not worth more than $20. And if it was priced according to what it is worth, I would have felt not as bad becuase I would not have baught it in the first place. I felt I got cheated. My only mistake was that I did not read these reviews before purchase. I decided to rate this product so others can know more about this product before buying, and I will read reviews before I buy my next item."
2,A Pamphlet,"This is not a book but a pamphlet for the Tibetan Medical Centre. It is about 30 pages long and contains photographs and descriptions of their work. It is about 5 1/2"" X 8 1/2"". I believe the cover is a photograph of a manuscript in a museum. There are other photogaphs of manuscripts but they are even smaller. It is not newly published but there is not a printing date that I can find. There is a solicitation for a donation, an order form for your horoscope and some other things you can order. With a little more thought I would have realized that it was not actually a book before I ordered it."
1,Review on Ancient Egypt,I don't think that this book contains the right amount of information on ancient Egypt. If I had the chance I would get my money back!!
3,Informative but dull,It is a good read for people with recent encountering with Egypt. But I was little appalled because information seemed dull. Book will give you facts and names but there isn't much more. Colorful images will attract your attention but I really believe those images have interesting legend and tales by their own.
5,One of the greatest books about the humble VW beetle,"This is one of those Rare books that will be enjoyed by Volkswagen enthusiasts and Photographers alike.Its a rare insight into the Volkswagenwerk Factory to see individual parts of a Volkswagen and the end result.In between the covers, there are the fabulous rare photographs of VW parts stacked on top of each other.I have a collection of books about the Volkswagen Beetle, but this book is not like any other Volkswagen book.I really do recommend this book , and if You are buying it for a Volkswagen beetle owner or VW enthusiast ,I'm sure they will be very pleased with this Gift.. maybe even ""over the moon""I bought My copy of this extraordinary Volkswagen: A week at the factory from amazon.comLee Noonan Australia"
4,A modern look at an ancient spectacle,"This book offers a refreshingly new slant on a subject that has been discussed at length by those who love and those who abhore the corrida de toros. At a time when animal rights enthusiasts would have us blush with shame over the systematic torture of an innocent animal, it takes courage and honest objectivity to bypass the emotional rhetoric in an effort to understand the history and the implications inherent in this unique dance of death. What can a contemporary Scottish woman in considerable physical and psychic pain tell us about this peculiarly Spanish drama? Surprisingly much. Kennedy covers a lot of ground very concisely and touches on artistic, moral, and philosophical implications that reverberate far beyond the immediate subject matter. Whether you have strong feelings for or against the ritual killing of bulls, you will find much that is thoughtprovoking in this cleardiscussion of the beauty and horror of bullfighting."
2,"No bad book, but Hemingway is much better.","On Bullfighting is'nt a bad book, but Hemingway is much, much better. Mrs. Kennedy is clearly no insider and seems to have her information out of books by Hemingway (she knows best the toreros of 1920 - 1930) and Lorca. After her information she has seen only very few real fights. This is not enough for a book."
2,Overwrought (but informative),"This book is written in language that some might mistake for fluid, inventive prose - but it's labored and overwrought. It doesn't help that the subject matter continually returns to the author's health and ill-spirit, or that every problem in her life can be conveniently and neatly tied to bullfighting. A typical passage will open with her problems, then segue with something like ""...but I won't think about my aching back, instead I'll distract myself with the story of xyz bullfighter who I just saw some film of..."" and will then return to her issues with life. The suicide thing is, frankly, a cliche. Ending with the positive - she does a good job of delineating the history and the terminology as it would naturally become accessible to the first-timer."
5,A word on brilliance,"To appreciate C. Ware's work is simple: his genius is hard to miss. From the palate he uses to construct seasons to the grotesques of characters reminiscent of certain 19th century tracts, the man is a master of his craft.Oddly enough I have found not one mention of the man's ability to panel well. The way he (literally) lays out his pictoral narrative is nothing short of amazing and nowhere is this seen more clearly than in Quimby Mouse. What essentially boil down to rotoscopic images more fit for a flip-book than a strip of celluloid transparencies, Ware's frames are set down in a fashion that is entertaining _to work through_. And rest assured, you will be working: often times a single page can and will take you a good 20 minutes to read thouroughly. This is material not for the casual reader of comics, but for the artisan or art critic who needs stimulation that runs beyond the visceral."
3,"Great protection, lousy usability","There's no doubt that the hard case will protect my Palm from damage. I just wish that they had made the hole in the bottom large enough so that the plugs for the power and sync cords actually fit with the case on! Unbelievably, this case is so poorly designed that you have to maneuver your PDA in and out of it every time you want to charge or sync it. It's not a difficult task but it is tedious. I have to wonder if they actually tested it with the cords that come from PalmOne with the PDA.This product does fine on the toughness scale, it just falls down on ease of use."
3,Good case,I disagree with some of the reviews I've read of this product. I've had no trouble connecting the Palm cables while the pda is in the case. Having the hinge on the right does take some getting use to if you've used another case but the product is advertised that way. I use mine for a Zire 72. It's good protection and the two slots in the inside of the case are great. I use mine for a memory card and a wi-fi card.
4,RhinoSkin palmOne Zire 72 Aluminum Hard Case,Perfect for handbag. Freedom from scratches and breakage.
1,Terrible product - do not buy!,"I gave a very positive review to this player last year. Unfortunately, there's a follow up on January 30th, 2008: I need to modify my original rating. The player suddenly stopped working last week - I last used it about a month back - now it appears to be dead. I've tried to charge it using the usb port on my computer : the player starts to charge, with the backlight alternately but irregularly coming on and off, and will start to boot, but then shuts down, starts to charge, with the backlight turning on and off, then starts to boot again but shuts down(before it gets past the Vibez screen) etc etc. Contacted customer support - they were of no use. I now possess a beautiful paperweight! Buy this player at your own risk."
5,Great Player,"Great player -- works beautifully. Drag and drop file management via Windows Explorer, Nautilus/Konqueror, or Finder. No need for extra software. The Vibez will automatically update the internal database, so searching and managing playlists on the fly works flawlessly.The best price out there for a 12GB flash player."
3,Secrets of Power Negotiating for Salespeople: Inside Secrets from a Master Negotiator,"I am enjoying this book. I have not yet completed reading the peice, but I do think that there are very many valuable messages. ON A SIDE NOTE. THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK ITSELF IS TERRIBLE. AS I ADVANCE THROUGH THE BOOK, PAGE BY PAGE, THE BOOK IS FALLILNG APART. WHOEVER BOUND THE BOOK NEEDS TO BE CONTACTED. ANY ADVICE, AS TO HOW TO HOLD THE BOOK TOGETHER WOULD BE APPRECIATED!!!!!!!!!"
4,A Huge Smash Collection!,"This film collection includes some of the best in the series, and one that is O.K., Several monsters appear including Mothra, Mechagodzilla, Titanosaurus, Godzilla Jr., King Ghidora, Rodan, and a few others including the man himself. An unbelievable collection for any die-hard fan!"
5,Penny Pinchers,"I love my slipcover. It is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's been over 2 years since I've had it and it's just like brand new. And it's easily washable, as long as you follow the care directions. It so worth the money I spent. My couch was kind of beat up...the bottom cushions had faded a bit, and there were a few spots that wouldn't come out on the arms, and when I put the slipcover on, it was like a brand new couch...and at a fraction of the cost of buying a new one. And this particular Microsuede material is very, very soft and comfortable. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this brand/material to anyone who wants to save the life of their couch a few more years or just if you want a different look/feel to your room."
5,"Welcome to Modern Hebrew, Level 2: Reading and Comprehension (Purchased on 05/03/2010)","The book I received was the teacher's addition, not the student addition as advertised on the Amazon website. Either the seller gave Amazon incorrect information or Amazon posted the book incorrectly. However, I kept the teaher's edition because it was such a great price.At some later date, I will still need to purchase the student addition"
3,car parts,"Compared to using a used one out of a salvage yard for $25 , this is not a bad unit for the price . It does work and it does cool like it is supposed to do , but when I finally got around installing it , the 2 lower mounting points were broken off. Instead of messing around with getting another one , I took the motor and fan blade off the new one and installed on the old housing of the old one. This is not the first time that I have had problems with Dorman products."
5,Fascinating Heartfelt True Story,True story of how a young Jewish boy succeeded in resisting the Nazis & then triumphed over his fate in life.
4,Great soap but...,This soap is great. I use it on my face and it helps to clear acne. But make sure you use a moisturizer - it's very drying!
3,Dudu-Osun Herbal Black soap,"It made my skin itch at first, but then it was okay on my skin. I might get more soon."
5,Love and Laughter in a box!,"This is a wonderful series! I had never seen any of these shows before purchasing them but because the reviews were so wonderful I thought I would give it a try. I discovered that this was a well written series that entertains for hours. I loved it so much that I thought my mother in law might enjoy it. I wasn't sure she would enjoy these because of the high brow humor. She loves them! It's been the first entertainment we both have been able to agree on. She watches them over and over and I think they might belong to her now. lol In short, if you are thinking of purchasing them do it. The boxed set provides many hours of enjoyable entertainment and the cost can't be beat. We love it and hope you will too. I love finding surprises like this..makes me feel like I have found a rare gem! : )"
5,Excellent,"A great British sitcom with wonderful characters. One of the main characters Jean, is played by Judi Dench. A celebrated and well known actress. All the characters are fun to watch though. The usual British wit and humor is so enjoyable in this series. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves ""Britcoms""!"
5,loads of laughs in each new DVD in set....,"This ""As Time Goes By"" DVD collection has been an extermely enjoyable experience for my husband and I. We have looked forward to each new DVD to see what transpires with Lionel and Jean. We will probably get the reunion DVDLoved the fun!"
5,Wonderful show,I recently found this show on the BBC channel and was so disappointed to find that I had missed the earlier years... now I can watch it over and over and savor its warmth and good humor whenever I please..... it's a gem!
5,"Good series, Good cast","BBC puts out some good sitcoms and this is one of the best. True to life, consistent characters. Excellent actors."
5,As time goes by.......,I love this series. The stories inside the stories are great. It is a much see TV series. I bought the entire series. Now I want the specials which are sold separtely.
4,A Touching Series,"A touching series; never in bad taste, often funny, and often true to life. Such fare is hard to find. The emotions evoked by the poignant theme song are played out by the two once young lovers, separated by mischance during the Korean War. They find each other again after a lifetime apart. The only problems with this fine series are the near ubiquity of gratuitous argument [which is less harrowing than that on FAWLTY TOWERS, but also less funny], and Jean's habit in the later episodes of pointless, compulsive lying. Excise these irritants [which probably represent lazy writers' padding] and we might have 5 stars."
3,Not the best,"Three of the discs (1st, 8th, 9th) have defects; they freeze up at one point. Also, the labels on the two disc-holding sleeves are wrong -- the first four seasons are in a sleeve labeled ""6 to 11"" (although there are only 9 seasons) and the last five are in a sleeve labeled ""1 to 5"". Season 9 is not formatted in the same way as the others; the screen image is ""squeezed"" vertically. Not fatal issues, but annoying."
5,Never too old for love!,"We have always enjoyed watching this show on PBS. Now we are so excited that we can watch it when we want. We do not usually enjoy any of the BBC productions, their wit is usually rather flat. ""As Time Goes By"" however is a very refreshing change and at times downright side splitting. I do not know how the younger folks would like this as we are older with grandchildren etc. But for us we thourghly enjoy each episode!"
5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!,I LOVE As Time Goes By! It's the best show ever- I must have seen every episode by now and they just get better and better. Everyone should have the series!!
3,Strangely Addicting,"I'm assuming most people purchasing these DVD's have already fallen in love with the series, but for those who haven't let me put in my two cents. I found this series on PBS late one night and absolutely HATED it. Then I watched the next night and hated it again. I kept doing the same thing again and again. Even though every time I think of this show the first word that pops into my head is ""boring"" I have to admit that somehow I have become addicted to it. The relationships between the characters are sweet and endearing. As a comedy, the funniest thing to me was the misperceptions the writers of this show have about Americans, (particularly Idaho). Anyway, I have a love-hate relationship with this show, but the love part usually seems to win out at the end of the day."
5,Great Series on BBC,"This show is very enjoyable to watch. Having lived in London, we can now recapture the atmosphere and gentile quality of the characters portrayed in this series. By buying the full set, we can now watch the show without time restraints. jk"
5,As Time Goes By,"I became interested in this series after watching it on Channel 13. It is funny without being vulgar, and you really come to love the characters. For a British situation comedy, it lasted for 9 seasons, which is very long by their standards. It stars Dame Judi Dench, the reigning Queen of English actresses."
3,A Throwback to a Gentler Age of Sitcom,"AS TIME GOES BY was one of the BBC's fondly remembered sitcoms of the 1990s - not so much because of the originality of the scripts (which were nonetheless well structured) but because of the acting. Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer as the lovers meeting once again after four decades were consistently entertaining; they formed a double-act who were at once worldly-wise yet optimistic, aware of the absurdities of the contemporary world yet ever-willing to embrace them. The supporting cast was equally good: Frank Middlemass and Joan Sims as Palmer's (screen) parents were consistently delightful, with their tendency to do outlandish things and make outlandish statements. These eleven discs contain every episode that was made: well worth the money."
1,Dissappointed,I received the product and it was a gift for my mom. Three of the tapes do not work on her dvd player however they work on mine. After investigating there are scratches on the three and they should have worked on her player. The seller did contact me and told me he would replace them but I later told him they did work on mine and thought my mom just did not insert them correctly.However they should not be scratched and I am told by the experts they should play on all machines. I will order used tapes again
1,Rather dull,"I had high hopes after watching ""monarch of the glen"" last winter. This, however, is just dull. The plot is unidimensional (will they get back together). The writing is a notch below mediocre with predictable sit-com ""jokes"". The laugh track is annoying . The acting is only OK. Don't know if I can bear to finish it."
5,As Time Goes By,I never tire of watching these wonderful series. As time goes by is a classic in my opinion.It shows everyday life in a realisitc way. People who love each other yet still drive eachother mad.Wonderful series.
4,Mom's going to love this gift!,"I and my two sibs are always trying to figure out a good group gift for Mom who is in her 80's. On a Saturday evening, if we call, she's always distracted and wants to know if we're watching 'As Time Goes By' (and we iften are). At that point, we usually give up and say we'll call in the morning. This makes a great gift at a great price!"
4,As time Goes By Series,Arrived on time. One disk was bad. I emailed the company and never heard from them.
3,Lousy Laugh Trak Ruins Series,"I don't know how anyone can enjoy the series with that awful laugh track over powering every verbal exchange.Could it be that we Americans are too stupid to know when to laugh? Not only that, but the laugh track peopleare too stupid to know when to modulated their snickers. So it's Rwa Haw Haw at every turn. So we wastedour money while buying the entire series.John W. Otis"
3,As Time Goes By -Complete Original Series,Complete Series 8 & 9 contained 2 series 8 dvd discs instead of 1 series 8 and 1 series 9 discs.(series 9 disc was missing)
2,Packaging is Poor,"The packaging is different than what is shown, the pieces are not attached and discs fall out. The company stood behind their product and refunded including shipping and a credit for my time."
5,One of the best comedy series anywhere.,I have been watching As Time Goes By for somethime now on PBS. I have to say that calling it a comedy is not totally correct. I would rather refer to it as a humerous look at real life. I cannot wait till I can afford the set. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes comedy and British humor. I also recommend it to anyone who is looking for good clean family viewing.
3,no closed captioning,i am partially deaf and i require closed captioning for any pogram i order. i requested this order be closed captioned. unforttunately the order arrived with NO closed captioning making the order almost useless. can this be corrected?
1,Closed Captions??,"I just purchased this set and really looked forward to viewing it, but I need the ""closed captions."" The box the set comes in says they are there, but I can't find them, either on my rather reliable Phillips player or on my computer DVD player. When the DVD is played, there is not ""Setup"" option.Can anybody else find them? Is it just me.Thanks for any help you can provide."
1,"Definetly NOT sage, but nice fabric","Bought and returned this as I was looking for a sage colored slipcover in suede. This is a very dark brownish-green. Not even close to my idea of sage. The 1 star rating is for color alone.But the fabric felt really nice, thick, very suede-like and soft.No idea how well it goes on, or how it will stand up as I did not even put it on my couch, just shipped it back."
5,Cool!,Stacey's parents are depending on her again! It's either she stays in Stoneybrook to take care of her mom with a desease or she will go to New York to celebrate his father's promotion job.
2,not worth the money,"This book was not what I had hoped it would be. It gave a run down of Italian style by region, but was not that helpful in incorporating it into the American wardrobe. In fact, it seemed as if Italian style was a bit boring."
5,Variety of Essays by Top Scientists--for the Layman!,"This book presents a great variety of short essays written by top scientists. Each essay is just a few pages long, and I was able to understand all but one very well. (I have no background in science.) I've already ordered several of them from my local library.And here's what I liked best: At the end of each essay is a short bio sketch of the scientist/author. Included in those bios are the titles of other books written by those authors...and most of them write science books for laymen."
5,What a hit!,"I ordered the original Mary Poppins books for my daughters' families so the grandchildren would have an idea of the story before they used the tickets (that we gave them for Christmas) to see the musical show at Proctor's Theater in Schnectady, NY. They loved the show and I appreciate being able to get them the books."
3,An OK Transcription.,"Given the fact that most computers come with ""spell check,"" I don't understand why there are spelling errors in these e-book transcriptions. However, the story, for all who are fans of Poppins, is just as good as it ever was."
2,Daily Deal Dud,"As a child I enjoyed the movie Mary Poppins. So when this book appeared as a Kindle Daily Deal, I was intrigued by the assertion that this contained material not in the film. I'm glad it was only $1.99. Frankly, this Mary is not very nice. She's brusque with the children, self-centered and vain."
3,Not what I expected,"I love this book and I am a little disappointed from the current issue. I have old issues that have much better illustrations. Over all though, a book is a book and the contents are a lot more important, so I'm happy with it."
3,Childrens Classic - NOT THE MOVIE,"don't lie to yourself like I did. ""Oh, I love that movie! The book must be delightful!"" While the book is nice, and a classic, beware that many classics show the era in which they were written. Many scenes from the movie were lifted from the book. But Travers' Poppins is very different from Disney's. I was quite surprised. I don't know that I'd recommend reading this for my children."
1,This book was horrible.,"I love to read, and have all my life. I don't know how I escaped reading ""Mary Poppins"" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book. I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it. I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it. You'd have to use a microscope to find it.Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting. I don't have a problem with that. My problem is Mary herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book. I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book. At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something. In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.Watch the movie. Forget the book."
2,Not a spoonful of sugar,"If you are expecting the Disney's Mary Poppins, you are best making another reading selection. Unfortunately, my expectations may have tainted my reading experience. The book is filled with fun imaginative adventures children would enjoy. However, Mary Poppins is stern and hard. Her tightly guarded compassionate side does pop up during different events, but overall she treats the Bank's children with a harsh and sometimes demeaning hand."
4,Mary Poppins -,"Wonderful Ms. Travers - These are books to read and enjoy, even if you have seen and love the movie. I read these books as a child, saw the movie as an adult - So the magic never left... Please encourage your children to read the books on which the Disney movies are based."
5,I WOULD RATE IT A KATRILLION STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mary Poppins is a classic book and yet is my favorite book in the whole entire world.My friend and I started a book club, and we chose to read Mary Poppins. Man was that a good choice! I am going to have my meeting in 4 days. Mary Poppins was an enjoyable book, read it my friend. ;)"
1,Appearances can be deceiving,"The product image implies you're buying an authentic linen cover containing the classic Mary Poppins illustration. No. You get a dust jacket with the image of a linen cover printed on it. The real hardcover is a plain red, no artwork. Inside, the paper feels like a cheap paperback.I bought this book for my daughter. I'm not counting on the poor quality to last to give to a grandchild. I'd be better served finding an old dusty copy from the 1960s from a quality printing."
3,Leave Mary Poppins alone!,"I was very disappointed with the revised version of the trip around the world. The original may be politically incorrect, but it made more sense and fit better with the time of the story!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Thankfully this book does not have a nanny that is anywhere near asannoying, or bursts into song in the same way as the painful movie.She behaves much more as you would expect, telling the kids off alot. She does include them in a bunch of strange happenings and outingsto many different locations."
2,"Spit-Spot, You're Fired, Mary Poppins","Mary Poppins, you may not be aware, is vain, snappy, haughty, and very little fun. I can not believe the Disney movie sprang from this book. There are some things the same: she came on the wind, she wore an apron, she gives them medicine, and she had an umbrella. There are numerous ""adventures,"" and some are very cute, but MP always manages to ruin the fun, snap at the four kids (2 twins, John and Barbara, join Michael and Jane), deny that they saw what they saw, and threaten them when they speak up, ask questions, or get impatient as she stands for ages in front of a shop window studying her fine relfection. Also, Bert has a very small role - one chapter or so. This is not the MP of the Disney interpretation. I would have kicked MP out before she had a chance to leave on the West Wind. Very disappointed. I thought this book was a classic for a good reason."
3,Imaginative!,"This book is well written and very exciting for the younger reader. It is a bit too far from reality and thus confusing. Too many stories within stories make it hard to remember the original story! Not quite sure what I was expecting, but this was a disappointment."
5,Good guy finishes last - but gets the girl,"The genius of the movie is the depiction of noble heroism of Naseeruddin Shah. Yes I call Shah's role heroic, because he has the bravery to marry a girl who has been duped by the smart alec Farroq Sheikh. Shah doesnt worry about what the ''society'' would say about him. In his quite way he acts very heroic and very noble. Contrast this with the loud, overacted, histrinoic bullcrap DDLJ"
3,Not for women with thighs,"Bought these shorts with fingers crossed after mixed reviews. I got a medium, (I'm a size avg size 6). the waist fit well, but the thigh stitching/elastic band was too tight. To remedy these shorts and not return them, I cut the bands on each leg (inner seam) to loosen the elasticity.Don't go with these, if you can afford to, I would recommend Sugoi Brand or other higher end shorts, especially if you have curvier/muscular thighs."
5,good quality,"I wore these to spin class and they were comfortable. The padding is thick and I didn't feel like I was wearing a diaper. After spin I jumped on the treadmill for a jog, didn't even notice I was wearing padded cycle shorts."
1,Not the best,"The shorts are not my favorite. They are very tight at the legs, the elastic really keeps the short in place... but a little TOO tight. I really dislike these shorts."
5,"A Wonderful, Amazing Book","How can you describe 246 pages of the most delightful writing in a paragraph? It is impossible. I can only say a few words that describe this wonderful book. It is an ongoing story, when you think all is good something happens. It is one of those books you soar through without noticing how much you have read. It is a happy and sad story, it is a calm and adventurous story, it has a very interesting plot, and I highly recommend it."
3,The translation in English is not my way!!!,"The translation in English is not my way!!! I like Omar Khayyam, but the translation from Perien to English is not nice enough!!"
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I've probably read almost every fishing book available, but Shaw Grigsby's book is the best. Not only does it teach you advanced fishing techniques, but it reminds you about what's really important in life. Reading this book made me a better fisherman and a better person. You should read this book, and then read it again."
5,Shaw's a straight shooter...,The title of my review is evident throughout this fine book. Anyone serious about bass fishing should read it. I've read my copy about 4 times already (since 1998 when I bought it) and it never seems old. This is a MUST have.
2,nice goal,"The book appears self-published, poorly executed, and outdated--although well-meaning. The monospaced text was irritating to read; the photo illustration were poorly reproduced. The cover was handsome, but the interior looked as though it were a photocopy of someone's senior thesis. The text was well-written, but the facts were outdated ten years later."
2,A tiresome experimental demo tape,"If you enjoy a collage of incongruent elements, you may enjoy this. I am a big fan of Tin Hat Trio, but this album reminded me of discordant elements one would find stuffed in a closet that hadn't been cleaned out for years. It comes across as a bunch of playful/frustrated jam sessions, with one or two decent tracks thrown in. I found it hard to tell with each track if my c.d. player was on random and choose to play another c.d. Spend your money wisely and spend it elsewhere."
3,animal or vegetable,"After hearing ""50 mile"" on the radio and the dj calling carla the female tom waitts, I had to buy the album. After listening to the entire album, I found that most of it sounds like the background music of a bad play. Most lyrics seem a little pushed and don't flow. I was a little disappointed, but only because 50 mile was sooooo good. I usually think musical monogamy is bad, but more reproducing of the sound/mood she got from 50 mile would have made for an excellent album in my opinion."
5,Bravo Ahmed Deedat!,"I love Ahmed Deedat's material and how he can stump even the most fundamental and learned Christians, Biblical scholars, evangelists, etc. Its a very short read but very imformative and detailed."
1,"Deluxe Service Cart With Locking Top, 4 Drawers and extra storage - Black",did not honor price I bought it for bad customer servicehad no idea pricing was wrong and now they will not honorBeware customer service no help
1,Substandard,"There are two performances that stand out in this set: The Op. 71 poems. The sound quality throughout is marginal (very thin old analog that makes Horowitz's muffled Third Sonata sound great), and one reviewer even said he/she thinks the piano was out of tune, which wouldn't surprise me.Ponti's Scriabin is sloppy and umusical in general. Only the Op. 71 poems make this set worth getting. Start with Robert Taub's sonatas, Horowitz Plays Scriabin (on RCA and Sony), and Glemser Vol. 1."
1,"Dead cheap ... but , unfortunately , a waste of money","Recorded in the mid '70s , this 'CD' has as much hiss as piano on it . What piano there is , is slightly distorted and far too bright .This is the complete catalogue , but , honestly , you'd be better off with midi files .I can't believe a record company actually released this **ap .Reminds me of those old 'classics' the tobacco companies used to sponsor in the seventies .Except , most of the collection sounds like it was recorded on an early Phillips cassette recorder .Cigarettes are better value than this product ."
1,pessimo CD,"RISCONTRO OGGETTIVO: il cd, nonostante ancora sigillato(quindi nuovo) presentava la custodia spaccata in più punti, probabilmente dovuto al fatto che il libretto interno era troppo grande forzando la custodia.La qualità di registrazione è veramente pessima, i livelli audio sono bassissimi e ciò è aggravato dal forte rumore di fondo che si sente. Inoltre i toni bassi sono appena percettibili. Sembra quasi una registrazione amatoriale. Infine mancano alcuni brani e ciò è specificato solo all'interno del libretto, nemmeno su internet.RISCONTRO PERSONALE: Non ho gradito affatto le interpretazioni dell'autore, che mi risultano incredibilmente ampollose, forzate, e prive di ogni cantabilità.CONCLUSIONE: L'unico riscontro positivo di questa raccolta è il prezzo molto contenuto."
3,"The playing is great, but..","After reading the other reviews here and subsequently purchasing this set, I feel that people should be warned about the audio character of the CD's. There's noise on the tracks - they were recorded in '74. And the piano has a dry ""bite"" that distracted me. I was hoping for a soft romantic sound. I couldn't fully appreciate the performances because of these issues. The price is nice; however, if you are just looking for Grade A recordings to fill the Scriabin gap in your collection, this set might not satisfy."
1,I'm going to save you the trouble,"The author writes an entire book about recipes which anybody could find in any cook book or online. The ONE and ONLY thing you want is on page 50. It's the reason why just popping a bud in your mouth will not get you high. It has to be cooked for the THC to be extracted and since THC is basically an oil, butter works best. I wasn't going to do this, but the author didn't even get that right. He tells us to combine the butter, ""leaf"" AND WATER in a ""stockpot"". Not true, what you want is a double-boiler to simmer the LEAF WITH BUTTER for 3 hours OVER THE WATER THAT SIMMERS UNDERNEATH AND NOT COMBINING THE THREE MATERIALS. When it's over, strain and press the buds to get all the juice. Refridgerate overnight and use the butter to make cookies or whatever (which fills in the rest of the book with standard recipes).The other snippet of info your probably looking for is whether Police dogs will know that they are pot-brownies, the answer is YES they will."
1,Arrived missing instructins and hardware,"Received in a timely matter just a few weeks ago, purchased the lumber to build today in time for Memorial Day picnic only to open box and find no hardware and no instructions (unless the picture on the box are supposed to suffice). If someone who has purchased this can tell me what kind (i.e. size, how many, etc.) hardware is required so that I salvage what I've got it would be much appreciated!!!Right now I feel forced to rate the item as 'i hate it' but hopefully can improve upon it if I hear back from the seller quickly (yes, I've already emailed and tried to call but they are closed)."
5,Good Brand,"Tactus Records is a good brand that released many Italy composers's articles. Inclues the famous ones, ex Monteverdi, Corelli, Vivaldi--and so on. There are still some are been ingorant, one is Colonna. He was the same age with Corelli, and compose many good Vocal and Intrumental music. I try this to find him colorful expression in his composition. I feel this one is worth buying in your store"
5,True Friends,"I loved this book, lots of friends information on teh first season. A great book for any FRIENDS fan."
3,Comments on Stack-On GC-900-5 Steel Cabinet,"Although the GC-900-5 is a simple steel cabinet, it can provide adequate safe storage of documents and jewlery. It is easily mounted on top of the Stack-On 5 ft cabinet, then bolted to wall studs. It is NOT a water proof nor fire proof cabinet, so other arrangements must be taken for those hazards. Use the cabinets for convenient temporary safe storage; remember thieves can and will tear away cabinets such as these with little care or thought."
5,Stack-on is good,"Excellent US made storage cabinet.It will keep kids and amatuer thieves away from your valuables.Bolts to the top of any Stack-on long gun cabinet.Plastic shelves are kinda hookey, but that keeps them from scratching your guns.Just do not overload them and you'll be fine.I am very pleased with the quality and the usefullness of this cabinet."
4,coupe,"The product arrived in a proper time span and in good condition. I was pleased with the purchase. Thanks,"
3,Still waiting,"We ordered the item on November 30, 2009 and are still waiting for it. Starting to get discouraged!"
4,Excellent case,"Slim and light. Fits the T3 tightly, with openings in the right places. There are three improvements I wish it had:1. The SD card holder slots inside are tight and deeper than a card. If you push too hard, you'll need tweezers to remove it. Because it's so tight, you don't need to insert all the way, so not a big deal.2. The belt clip, unlike my cell phone clips, doesn't ""lock"" in different positions. The wheel spins freely, thus it always hangs vertically. Wish I could spin it 90 degrees and have it lock there.3. My biggest complaint. The strap snaps on the back. It's a hassle to try to quickly snap it back again without looking at it. Velcro would have been SO much nicer, faster, and easier to use.Overall, however, I would recommend this case."
1,Very Disappointing CD,"The only reason I bought the CD was a single song I couldn't find anywhere else. The rest of the songs, other than Jefferson's, are absolutely horrendous."
1,Borrrring,"Don't waste your money on this! I paid $25 for this piece of crap!!! It's dull, slow and very very boring, not to mention hard to follow. The sound quality was horrible too. David Carradine was on one of the PBS channels and I taped part of his demonstrations, what little segment I taped was a 100% better then the entired Dr. Tam DVD. Don't buy it!"
4,A Good album...but wait for the Buddha rerelease,"This is the first CD issue of an album released by RCA's Camden subsidiary in 1970. It was an abbreviated version of a 1965 album called ""Country Favorites-Willie Nelson Style"" (due from BMG subsidiary Buddha in early 2000)But if you can't wait, here's some info: Willie is backed by Ernest Tubb's Texas Troubadors (uncredited on the album, for legal reasons). There are no Nelson originals here, however.When RCA edited this album for reissue in 1970, they dropped three songs from the 12-song album: ""My Window Faces The South"", ""Home In San Antone"", and ""Making Believe"".Still, if you can't wait for buddha's CD, you can't go wrong with this one."
2,"Pop Shelf, Not Top Shelf","D. J. Murphy's book of short stories, ""Sons Like Me"" failed to distinguish itself from the caliber of the writing of a couple of the (popular) contemporary African-American gay authors. If you are starved for books reflecting the lives of brothers ""in the life"" and want to support African-American gay authors so much so that you're willing to purchase ""pulp fiction"", then this book may be just your taste. As with works by other authors of this genre that I've read, the writing here is not ""characterized by skill, lucidity and polish"" (one of Webster's definitions of ""literate""). The plot lines and character development have some merit. I gave this book two stars (instead of one) only because I've seen worse. What do I know, though? Other books in this vein are pop sensations."
1,"Get the book, not the video","While the book by Stephen Mitchell is the best translation of the New Testament sayings of Jesus I've found, the video is a great disappointment. All the celebraties reading passages merely detracts from the overall message. The book I would rate a five, but save your money on the video."
5,ICE IS A NECESSITY,"Ice is a necessity for terrestrial life. Without it - all land formations would be submerged.Beyond this obvious fact - ""ICE"" takes us into the chemical and behavioral dimensions of ice and how it works influences our weather, ocean currents and temperature, and the our Earth's atmosphere.As a water researcher of many years - I liked learning about how the world's foremost ice research center is in New Hampshire; how ""sea smoke"" is created when water gives up heat to cold air; about ""splash ice"" and ""diamond dust""; how as ice forms it rejects many impurities - even air; about what role ice plays in the life of animals and other life forms; about cosmic ice, and many other cool things.Water Voices from Around The World"
2,Tedious...,"I'm a sucker for intensive studies of a single topic (e.g. ""Cod"", or ""Salt""), AND I love arctic exploration books, so I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, this author takes a fascinating subject and manages to wring all the life out of it by writing in a such a dull, plodding fashion. I tried skipping ahead, hoping it would get better, but after skimming several chapters, I finally gave up. I'm sure there's a great book to be written about ice, but this isn't it."
3,Warm treatment of ice,"Ignore the PW print review: This is a wonderful treasure chest of science, stories, lore and quotes about ice in all its many, many forms. Recommended for all lovers of popularized science--and of natural beauty."
3,"very good item, very bad packing","The product is a spare part for my slide and film scaner, the item is really good but for a small piece like this they put it in a box inside of anoter box...the big box was a 16 pounds (in volume)and I had to pay over $60.00 for the shiping from my P.O.box in Miami to Honduras where I'm living right now."
2,not very powerful,It did not seem to pump enough for for as many spray heads as it should have for the rated amount
4,Happy with it,"Took a bit longer than I wanted to receive it...but I'm happy with the product. I had such a hard time finding something non-babyish to match my bedroom colors. Wish it wasn't so expensive for something I'll only use a few months, but glad I could find it. I'm so tired of baby blue and trains and sports bedding for boys. I just had my 3rd boy and have refused to do all the cutesy stuff!"
3,"Good story, bad main character...","I have to say, I was a little wary of reading The Wife Trap after learning that it centered around the selfish Jeannette, who had abandoned her fiance in the previous novel. While I don't enjoy books with the perfect heroine, I also don't like reading stories with flaky main characters like Jeannette.The problem is that we are meant to believe that Jeannette, a woman given to throwing temper tantrums, is actually a quiet soul with a penchant for painting and long walks. Highly doubtful. Ms. Warren is a very good writer, and delivers a well-written and humorous novel. However, without a likable heroine, the story is not nearly as good as it could have been."
1,least favorite of the trilogy,The writing style is great but i just could not get over the heroine's spoiled brat attitude and she had no other redeeming qualities to recommend her. It's a wonder that the hero would even fall in love with someone so obnoxious. It was the heroine that made this story unpalatable.
1,IT SUCKED!,The heroine was an ass. Nothing at all to like about her. Why the hell would her happiness be a good thing? I just do not get what the author was thinking.
1,"Obnoxious is not even close,,,","The main character of this book is a whiny, infantile, ridiculous, spoiled brat. And, she never changes. There was nothing redeeming about this character and therefore nothing redeeming about this book. Save yourself the money and the time. I will boil it down for you, she is a miserable witch but since she is beautiful, the ""hero"" thinks she is worth pursuing. I guess he deserves her then. But, I sure didn't. This book was a total waste of money."
1,"could have been so much better,..","this album got great reviews all over the place, so flying blind and only hearing the 1st and 2nd track on another site I decided to buy this cd, I wish I hadnt, its unfortunate because she has an amazing voice, but all the songs are poorly constructed and in some her singing is down right ugly, she tries for notes that are out side her range and it just sounds terrible, I think plaid ( the producer ) has a lot to answer for becasue of this.The album kinda reminds me a little of k.d langs ""even cow girls"" soundtrack, but much worse........hopefully her next album she'll have some more honest people around her letting her know what sounds good and what sounds crap."
1,Yawn,"I was a fan of WASP back in the day, so when I happened across this CD (featuring Randy Piper, ex-WASP) I figured I check it out.The first song's pretty good, but man is it downhill from there. I have to admit I was pretty surprised at how weak the guitar solos are. I mean, this is Randy Piper's band. You'd think he'd put on some ripping guitars or something, but they're not on here.Some of the songs sound like 4-track demos. I know Animal isn't on a major label or anything, but nowadays you can do some pretty decent recording for minimal $$. These guys must've blown whatever money they did have on beer, because they didn't spend it in the studio. Nor did they spend it on the album cover. Who designed this thing??? I've seen better artwork from special ed kids.Weak. Just weak."
1,NEVER GOT IT. Lost in the mail.,Amazon issued a refund. Yippee. What I really wanted was the enclosure. Oh well.
3,good color,Ink is not instant dry but I have had no problems with it sticking . I usually give it a day to dry. Color is good & I have not seen the fading that I get on some other brands.
3,Native History,I received the book fast and in the condition stated. It is a thin book with a lot pictures and basic information concerning the Yurok tribe.
2,Humorous book.,"I love Darrell Huckaby's humorous columns, but I did not think this book was as good as his weekly writings."
5,Tapwave has folded up the Zodiac camp,"This is an AWESOME device but you need to be aware that Tapwave, she's dead. Buying this device is a huge risk as there is effectively no warranty, and you will be unable to download updates for it or purchase games that were made for it.(...)"
2,Zodiac2 is good BUT....,"The Zodiac2 is a good option for a palm/handheld. The fact of the matter is that many want the Zodiac2 simply for its capability to play games, or even backup games. Zodiac2 is great for this keeping in mind it will only be able to handle lower level systems eg. 16bit. If the buyer is truely interested in just the gaming aspect of this product, there are better choices out there such as the gp2x (google it). On the other hand, gp2x doesn't have websurfing capabilities which I believe the Zodiac2 does. Before purchasing this product, just keep in mind what you really want it for. Finally, the future of Tapwave is looking grim, so your warrenty and support might soon mean diddly."
5,A Reviewer's Look at the Zodiac 2,"As I said in my Zodiac 2 review at Tapland, the Zodiac reminds me of a luxurie SUV that, when you look under the hood, also contains a powerful motor. ""While being marketed as a hand-held game console that runs off of Palm OS 5.2, the Zodiac reminds me of the Dodge Durango - some people like it for its smooth ride and body design but the guys are focused on one thing: the HEMI power under the hood. That is what attracted me to the Zodiac. Not the enhanced graphics and game controls as much as the awesome PDA ""under the hood.""""All that being said, there is nothing like being able to whip out your PDA (I consider it a PDA more thatn a gaming console due to the way I use it) and play Doom II or race around the track in Stunt Car Extreme.I have had my Z2 for about 4 months now and still consider it to be the best PDA on the market, bar none."
4,sleek & sexy with lots of inputs,"With no trouble at all, this expansion dock was up and running. On my system, it currently maintains a network connection, parallel printer, usb camera doc & photo printer, external keyboard, mouse, and amplified speakers, to the docked laptop. A single usb 2.0 connects the dock to the laptop. The dock is height adjustable and cradles the laptop very comfortably. It looks great, functions great, and if it withstands the test of time I will give it a five out of five stars."
4,Very close to optimal,"Everything about this docking station works perfectly (I am running a Dell Latitude) except for the over promise on the document holder. While it is a great idea, there is no way an 11"" tall piece of paper will fit between the clip and the top of your keyboard. Decently attactive piece, as well."
1,Worthless as a docking solution,"As a laptop stand, it is fine. However, it won't run my speakers (get left channel only), or my USB keyboard. I ended up plugging all of my devices back into the laptop. I would look elsewhere if I were you."
3,"Great dock, may hurt eyes","Just got this for my new laptop at work. It works very well so far, but it comes in this crazy shiny silver finish which may make your eyes hurt if you have a light over your head. You can solve this in many ways, but the best would be if manufacturer would provide a different color."
3,An overall good game reviewd by an 8 year old,"My son thought this game had great characters and enjoyed bashing characters with chairs, bats, and other things. Robocat's special attack is that he can fly up and then shoot bombs down. It's cool says my son. ""That will be about it"", he says."
5,Macally Waist Band Carrying Case for iPod Grey,I give it five stars if it holds up for at least a year and nothing snaps loose or tears then It is worth a rating of 5. I would like to say how well built the case is. I see many of the people wearing the little mp3s hit them in the face or arms when they go into a fast run. I like having the music attached at the waist while exercising. The cord stays close to your torso and won't tangle in the equipment. This carrying case seems to be as well built as other similar cases that members have been using for years with their cd players. Neoprene material holds up quite well under regular use.
1,INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING,"I suffered through three-quarters of this book then took it back to the libary without bothering to finish it. i simply DID NOT CARE about the story or characters. I told myself if the author wrote, ""dear bookbuyer"" one more time within the book, I'd throw the book into a river (which I couldn't do since it wasn't my book, but would have loved to!) I was really surprised at how horrible this book was since i figured the author of Schindler's List (which I haven't yet read) would know how to write!"
1,Cannot believe it got any good reviews!!!!!!!!!!,I kept thinking it would make sense or get better or have some substance. It was remarkably bad! I threw it away after reading 200 pages or so and it only has 277. What a waste of time and money!!!!!!!...
4,Spoken Tamil,"This textbook is a good introduction to 'Spoken' Tamil. The emphasis is on the spoken aspect, and not the written aspect of Tamil. It does go over the Tamil alphabet, and teaches some minimal written Tamil. It can be a great start to learning Tamil, however another book would be better to learn the written form of the language after using this book."
5,Cellars actually scared me!,"I've read this book twice (with about 8 years between each reading), and it still scares me. John Shirley has a knack for taking something I do without thinking about it, such as closing my eyes, and makes me SCARED of doing it. In Cellars, he's got New York City subways, and sub-subways, and psychics, and street urchins, and horrible ""blessed"" people, and secret societies, and things coming up from drains, and each horrific event is more disturbing than the last--all the way to the last page. Shirley doesn't write many horror novels, but when he does... Well, you have to read one for yourself. The only other book that actually scared me--and I read a LOT of horror stories--was another John Shirley book, In Darkness Waiting."
3,cellars,"Creepy..not as good as the first half of Demons but better than most horror these days. Shirley believes its possible, thats what gives goosebumps..just like Lovecraft."
5,How can something so gruesome be so satisfying?,"I just started chapter five of ""Cellars"" earlier today. This is exactly what a creepy horror novel is supposed to be. Wonderful mise-en-scène: Critics often talk about how in a John Ford Western, the landscape itself is a character. What Ford did for the old West, John Shirley does for the New York City of the ""me first,"" Reagan revolution 1980s. While Ford's wilderness panoramas awed viewers with the power and beauty of nature, Shirley's smoldering New York is always just on the verge of doing something unspeakably nasty to his protagonists and to the reader's ability to sleep with the lights off."
5,"Excellent safe, shipping not so excellent","The feature we like most about this safe is it's weight to price ratio: for the money, you get a very heavy safe that would be extremely challenging for a thief to make off with. I'd expect to find the would-be burglar on the floor of my house doubled over with a well deserved hernia. Yeow! At 1.9 cubic feet, there is also plenty of room for most items we wish to store, though we will be purchasing a second shelf from brinks soon. The only problem we had concerned shipping, which was timely but like many other people ours had a decent sized dent on the back side. This has no effect on functionality, and since the back can't be seen, it was no big deal. Something to remember when you order yours."
4,Lesson: Be yourself!,"This has a charming story, and wonderful illustrations. Kids can learn about being themselves and being a good friend by Big Al's example. It has a heroic main character who saves the fish who had refused his friendship. What I think could have been done better/differently is to play up the ideas that no matter what you look like, you can be a good friend, and that it's important to be yourself. Clements ends the story a little too suddenly to explore that idea, in my opinion. It does, however, leave room for classroom or parental discussion once the story has been read. This is a sweet book, with a nice message, even if it's not terribly obvious."
5,Excellent,This book is a great book for young children to learn about discrimination. That you need to look into what someone is like instead of what they look like. The illustrations are very colorful so they catch a young persons eye. Every pre-schooler should own this book.
5,love this book.,"I bought this book for my prek 3 class on friends. what a great book. so cute, the pictures are great, funny. they are going to love this story. my daughter read it, she's in 5th grade, and was laughing throughout the story. I just love it."
1,out of tune,"Apparently the master tapes for this recording must have been damaged, or perhaps the machine used to transfer the tape to digital was not in good working order, as this recording has some serious pitch distortion."
5,My daughter wants a dragon!!,"My 4 year old daughter and I read this hardcover book at least 20 times in the last week and she has asked for a dragon. She was very upset when I told her we could not have one - where would we put it - we live in the city and not on a farm like the little girl does. She said - let's buy a farm. Simple logic. Obviously this is a hit in our house - right up there with ""Knuffle Bunny"" (which we can buy the doll). The illustrations are beautiful and really fantastic, the southern drawl you adopt while reading is fun. Raising Dragons is simply a great book about friendship and caring for others. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
4,Fair,"I bought this book for my four year old. It was okay. the imagery was a bit dark - she was a little frightened by it.The text size could have been larger for that age so that I could have started pointing out shorter words to her while I read to her. The text to background contrast also needed some work; it was a little difficult to read.The story line was interesting and after she got over her anxiety about what was happening in the story -because of the first impression caused by the use of color, she thought it was a good story."
3,coverage on Reed Solomon is not very good,"This book is marketed several places as a good cookbook for Reed Solomon coding and just plug in some subroutines and you have an encoder or decoder. It cover binary BCH codes pretty well, but when it gets to REEd-Solomon it glosses over it and gives one useless example. It would have only taken a few more pages to make this a whole lot more useful for me, I am some what new to coding, but not an idiot and had to read it several times to get the point on binary BCH code arithmetic, but as far as non-binary I am still looking. I haven't looked at the Viterbi algorithm or convolutional codes maybe I will report more later"
1,A book hard to cook,There are a lot of typing errors and crucial information missed in this book. And the C/C++ routines come with this book do not work properly.
5,One of the better,"It is not only a good introduction to OOP and Java (and there are a lot of those), it's also a good book on learning JBuilder 3 (and there are very few of those). I have been working with JBuilder 3 for several months now, and was frustrated by the lack of good books using this tool. I found this book and have been very happy with it. The writing is good. The example that he creates is simple, but functional, and I feel I've learned more about the Jbuilder IDE."
4,a keep-it-real author tells us HOW to pray,"""Prayer Secrets"" explains thatto be certain of answered prayer,believers must follow God's rules governing prayer.author: HAGIN, Kenneth E. (the father, not Kenneth Hagin)format: (thin) paperbackISBN: 0892760052"
5,Review of a review,"While I haven't had a chance yet to read ""An Omelette and a Glass of Wine"", the review from ""cookyoberg"" of Dickinson, Texas, made it very clear that this is a book I would enjoy reading. Being both familiar and fond of the works of MFK Fisher, hearing about Elizabeth David's collected essays has made me determined to add her works to my collection (ever-growing!) of cookbooks, books about cooking, and books about life through cooking. But then again, aren't all cookbooks about life? Many thanks to ""cookyoberg""!!"
2,Good Product not many activities,"I bought this product for my one year old daughter for christmas. She enjoys playing with the easel and putting the magnets on it, but that is about all it does. It only keeps her entertained for a few minutes at a time and then she is on to the next toy. It does help working with words of common things to be able to show her, but I thought this product would allow her to draw with the magnets and it does not. The children can not create any drawings magnetic or not all they do is place the magnets on the easel."
1,"""Musical"" easel does not play music.",The Magnetic Easel that I received did not play music; I returned the product and never received a refund for it.
1,No words can explain how bad this is,My wife and I just finished watching this... I feel bad even admitting we finished it. The dialogue is awful. The lead character just drives all around showing no emotion while huge chunks of ice fall all around him. And my favorite thing... they total 2 machines and an airplane and only get a small bump on the head (which magically moves around from scene to scene and then just disappears) and each time everyone is fine. I won't even waste any time talking about the horrible special effects. Not one redeeming quality.
1,Looked like it was made in a teen's basement.,"My family and I started watching 2012 Ice Age, and within 20 minutes into the movie, we had to turn it off and watch something on TV. It was that horrible. The acting was very bad, and the special effects were just unbelievably horrendous. It looked like they copied clips of video games and other movies, then pasted it into this movie! And when the family was in the car, you would look past the people and see white. They didn't even fill in parts of the scene. I'm pretty sure a 15 year old could do better than this if they were given the equipment. If you were planning on buying this movie, please don't. It will save you time and money. I got lucky because I rented this at Redbox, and it only cost $1, but you will be making a HUGE mistake if you spend more than a dollar on this. So please, do yourself a favor and buy a decent movie to watch."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad.",This movie is just painful to watch. I actually feel bad for the people who wasted their time and money making this film. It's slightly better than what you would expect from a group of high school druggies. What amazes me is that someone actually agreed to print and sell this. Maybe they will make back the $158.12 they put into the production of this film. Everything that makes a decent movie is absent from this film. If there were negative ratings I would give it a -2.
1,You will laugh...,"...but perhaps not for the reasons you expected. This flick - as all previous reviews have indicated - is the mother of all turkeys. A jewel-encrusted, fur-lined, ocean-going balls-up of a film that will have you convulsing in disbelief. 2012 Ice Age? More like 1992. With a plot that has more holes than a... (sorry, couldn't think of a suitable analogy. Let's just say it's more hole than plot) acting that makes your average porno actor look like an Academy Award contender and FX that are too low-tech for an episode of South Park, you will split your sides laughing at the monumental lameness of this film. The ""Plan 9 from outer space"" of the last decade - but without the camp cuteness. OMFG."
1,Makes other bad movies seem good,"I don't know what to say about 2012 Ice Age. The description on the back of the DVD made it sound like an intelligent movie, but that is so far from the truth. A more accurate description would be ""Ninety minutes of incoherent noise."" I'm glad I only paid $4.50 for the rental because I'm feeling ripped off right now.Everything about it is bad. Even the special effects look like they were done by elementary school kids."
1,BUDGET ACTORS,These actors are the worst ever. This movie proves anyone can be a actor. I can't believe they would waste a DVD to burn this garbage on.
1,Comedy,It is a comedy without meaning to be. The worst film and acting of all time. Do not waste your time.
1,Worst film of the year??,"Geez...one word that describe this movie: crap!! Geez..it's agony to sit through this film. All those 1-star reviews before me are absolutely accurate! This is really bad beyond description. It's pathetic! I don't even want to waste my time writing a long review, simply not worth it."
1,Great Movie...,"Great Movie....if you are eight years old. Even then expect to be appalled at the poor acting (no evidence of such), special effects (nothing was close to special), plot (it was plotless-ish) and believability (not at all credible). I watched the whole film and felt dirty... but I gave it an undeserved chance. It was awful from the very dreadful beginning to the very pathetic end."
1,RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was by far one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The only thing more asinine than this movie was me for paying money to see it and then sitting through the entire film. I can't decide which was worse, the storyline, the acting, or the cartoon-like special effects... Please don't watch this movie- RUN!!!"
1,CRAP,"Wow, what a load of crap. One of the worst movies Ive ever seen. The idea is great. The acting, script, and ""special effects"" leave a lot to be desired. What a waste of 4 bucks. Both WB and Amazon should be ashamed for offering this movie."
1,Horrible Acting,"I've never seen such bad acting, although I did enjoy some of the special effect, but altogether it's just not worth it."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen!,"The acting, the script, the cartoon like special effects....just bad. It was like it was written for a high school play or something. If you look for technical accuracy in a movie, this one will drive you crazy! This movie should have been billed as a comedy. Wait and see this free sometime if you must....."
1,"Bad, bad movie. Don't buy it.","The worst effects ever.The worst acting ever.The worst storyline ever.Take my advice, don't watch it."
1,"A MUST SEE,, because it's so BAD !!!!","I've seen bad films before and just switched off / walked out, but this one is so bad you have to carry on watching!!I have never done so many LOL's during a 'horror!' film ever.The people instantly freezing then turning blue was probably the funniest yet worst special effect i have ever seen!The quality of acting in this film sank to a new level, beneath the dredges of the thespian barrel.A kindergarten school must have been hired for writers, editors, producers, special effects and director.THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN"
1,PEOPLE! Look at the Studio--- ASYLUM means AVOID!,"Sorry Folks, but everytime I see a movie released by THE ASYLUM ENTERTAINMENT, I avoid it like the plague.All of their movies looks like they were made by the inmates of THE ASYLUMNext time look at the studio - if it says ""ASYLUM"" avoid like crazy and save your money"
5,2012 Ice Age,The Service was very prompt and the Movie was received in excellent working order and very quickly. Enjoyed the courteous service. Thanks
1,LOL,"One star would be generous. The extras probably received coupons for subway. This DVD also show bloopers on special features, lol the whole movie is a blooper."
1,Don't say I didn't warn you.,"Not a low budget film! This is more like a welfare budget film. Redbox should be sued for offering it. Don't try to sell this DVD.. Instead, get a clock motor mount it in the center of the disk, drill a small hole in the top and shazam makes a cool looking wall clock! P.S. Amazon, 1 star indicates that your a General in the Army, 1 star indicates that you have at least gotten one of your chores done, 1 star in the movie biz should indicate that there is at least 1 star in the film... Where's the rating button for I want my money back. Consider adding a -$ before your 1st star."
1,2012 Ice Age is the worst movie of all ages,"I can't believe this movie is so pathetic. This movie had really cheap special effects I can tell that they hardly used money like only 250,000 some good movies use up to at least 200 million dollars! Stupid. The movie poster is great that's how it gets people's attention. Even the helicopters look fake, from some video game, and it has a boring story line don't watch it."
1,This movie left me cold,"To say that this movie is bad would be an understatement. I kept watching just to see what was going to happen, but it was sheer torture. Horrible acting, terrible effects... I don't know if I have one positive thing to say about this movie. It was so bad that I want a refund!"
1,Needs more research,"The author has a good heart and expresses it well. There are several clues in the writing, however, that indicate he does not know all that he should about either his subject or the culture surrounding it.At one point he speaks of telephoning the tribe in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to ask about the Medicine Lodge. They deny any knowledge, and he assumes they have none.Wrong. And anyone who seriously practices Native American spirituality can tell at a glance why."
5,Dessert Plates,"I own a full set of Butterfly Meadow dishes, but wanted a plate that is smaller than the salad plate that comes with the set. The dessert plates are a beautiful contrast to the white floral dishes and match the rice cups that I often use for ice cream or other side dishes."
3,I wouldn't recommand,"These plates are still beautiful, although the patterns look quite simple and dull. And they don't seem so useful. First, they are too big. They are only 1 inch smaller than smaller plates in 18 peice dinner set. And number of plates in this set(4) doesn't match with the 18 piece dinner set which is made for 6. If you would like to have a 3 course dinner with 5 firends, you will have to buy one more set so that everyone can enjoy the dessert. It will be a waste of money. I would rather recommend you to buy 7 piece salad/pasta bowl set, and serve salad with the bowls and serve dessert with the smaller plates in the 18 piece dinner set."
5,Please read this book so the author will write more!,"This book took me totally by surprise. I finished reading it in a few hours, but it's been two weeks since I finished, and I'm still mulling things over in my mind. It doesn't explain slavery, not how it affected those who were slaves nor those who perpetuated it. But this wonderful writer wakes you up to the subtleties."
4,A Treasure Chest of Stories,"I found Li's memoir engrossing, informative, and quite frequently very moving. I disagree with the comment that Li seemed a dispassionate observer; on the contrary, Li's feelings and unique perspective permeate the piece as she tells her family's multi-generational history. This is one of the great charms of the book; Li gives us a treasure chest of stories as she speaks candidly about her family's struggles, sacrifices, and courage in the face of wartime danger and personal tragedy. Li's love and filial respect for her parents, her complex and passionate feelings toward an evolving China, and her commitment to public service spoke poignantly to this reader. As an added bonus, Li illustrates and explains certain aspects of Chinese culture, thus enabling this reader to learn more about China within the context of the histories Li relates."
4,It's Sarah!,"Although it's not hard to see why these were passed over in favor of the master takes which sound fresher and more inspired than these alternates, it's still great."
1,Not original,"Received item that was not in factory packaging.Was missing at leat 1/4 of content.Was informed by shipper that since perfume was nolonger being produce, that was the way they ship."
3,Not bad,"My daughter was using an old set of wood crutches for her broken leg, so there was no padding at all on the hand rests, and fairly hard (old) plastic padding on the underarm rests. These helped considerably, at first. But they did flatten out fairly quickly. I put some pieces of scrap fleece fabric underneath each crutch piece, and that added enough additional padding to get her through the rest of her ""sentence."""
2,Not that great,"Didn't really hold up like I expected. I would highly recommend get a better quality and pay the price. With this product, you really get what you paid for."
4,helps a lot!,"First, let me say that these are not the highest quality materials. At the same time, for the price sold I didn't really expect them to be. I'm on crutches for a few weeks, so they're working fine for me. The armpit pad is especially nice, as I was really having a lot of trouble with the rubber pad. The hand pad squished flat really fast, though - I'm waiting on some gel foam pads for the handle."
4,Hand grips were great,"Under arms pads were ok, Hand grips were the best. That was the most helpful. Hand grips are worth it."
2,real skaters stay away,"one of my friends convinced me to buy an ABEC-rated bearing, and boy was he wrong. The fact that these are ABEC 7s do not ensure speed or durability; nor does the Mike Vallely stuck on the packaging. These are low quality, clunky bearings. Do not waste your money on the name. Mike Vallely and ABEC do not ensure quality, nor are they worth the extra 5 dollars when you can get a pair of MUCH better (in my experience) bones Reds for 15 bucks. Or upgrade for another 10 bucks to Bones 6-balls. however, do not waste your money on these... bottom linethey are decent, but not worth it when 5 LESS dollars gets you some mad-fast Reds."
4,Good overview on German settlements in Russia,"This book gives a good history of the Germans who settled the Volga and Black Sea areas...why they came, where they settled, who they were, and their experiences from the 1700s through the early Communist regime, where the majority were then packed off to Siberia. It also details their emigration to the US, Canada, South America, and other areas. There arn't many books on this subject, at least not in English, but this one is a good overview of their history."
4,Obscure but enjoyable,"This early Rossini opera is so obscure that it doesn't even get a mention in ""Kobbe's Opera Book."" It's an opera seria in a similar style to Mozart's ""Idomeneo."" The lead role of the warrior Tancredi was originally a castrato part - here it's performed by a mezzo. Mario Bayo is the standout cast member as Tancredi's love interest. The plot is a typical tale of love vs. duty - it doesn't really matter when and where is it set. Lots of impressive coloratura singing. The production and sound quality are very good. Be sure to wait through the curtain calls, as there is an ""encore"" of the alternative ending Rossini wrote."
1,This is not Donald Fagen. This is Steely Dan crap !,"If you're seeking the Donald Fagen sound from his last three albums, this isn't it. Don't waste your $$$.It's more raw, not polished.I'm giving this CD away."
5,An Important Book,"Full of empathy, insight and a necessary dose of incredulousness, Grossman is one of the most important writers on this tragic subject. Death as a Way of Life is also particularly relevant for Americans who want to know what life under terror feels like."
2,Doesnt seem to fit properly,Maybe I overestimated my size and went to big with the belt. But it doesnt seem to fit properly and hits in weird places. Might be better if it fit better.
2,Not a good fit,"Product came as discribed, however the size indicated was not true to the size it should have been. A Lg/XL should have fit but was way too big on me. I tried on a Sm/Med in the store and it was way too small, and they did not have a larger size. Wish I would have waited to try it on in the store."
3,2nd time user,Product not as good as used to be. Had it 3yrs ago and it worked magic. Now the quality is not that good plus it rolls and doesn't quite stay in place
3,Adds Support,"This band definitely adds support and is great for days when you are up and walking a lot. The problem I had with it is the material would fold because it is thin. I thought it would be thicker to resist folding, but it isn't. It did add support for my walks, but I think if I wanted even more support I would look for a product that was sturdier."
2,Not the best,"The pros: doesn't show through clothes, velcro is strong and doesn't wear out in washer, machine washable, provides some minor lift for your bellyThe cons: Rolls up on the sides, creates ugly pressure marks on your sensitive belly skin, provides no back support, doesn't breathe and makes you sweat, wrinkles and stretches out to diminish support even furtherBottom line, I used this with my second pregnancy and it was the worst one I've had. I've tried others that were great, I don't know where Medela went wrong with this product. It worked better when my belly was less than 40 inches around (which is tiny), after that, it was useless."
2,Not great,"The only thing this belt has going for it is how easy it is to put on. It does NOT stay in place, the fabric rolls and scrunches. You have to constantly refit it for it to do any good. And this is while walking. I had to adjust it every ten minutes, at least. Not a good design."
3,back support,I have major back pain at night from carrying around a nine month pregnant belly! The support helped a little but also gave me heartburn and was uncomfortable. I was so excited to buy this and now rarely use it.
5,Great supper for twin belly,Love this belt for my growing twin belly. I am 21 weeks and hv plenty of room to grow into this belt. Fast shipping too!
2,It's not comfortable,I tired wearing it but it's very uncomfortable to stay long time( more than hour). After removing I feel much better.
5,Fantastic picture,"Excellent picture, excellent colors. There's just nothing bad to say about this TV. I wish that the rear inputs were a bit better positioned, but that's just a nitpick as they're easily accessible. The standup mount that it comes with is easily removed if you want to wall mount it, and it's quite sturdy.This TV is also compatible with Samsung's $600 powered wall mount, which is frankly incredible and well worth it. Normally a powered wall mount runs around $1500 or more and requires a separate remote. Samsung's powered wall mount costs less than half that, works with the TV remote, and has 3 preset positions to move the TV into. It will even go back to flush with the wall when you turn the set off and return to the same position it was in when you turn it back on."
2,Tearing Problem,"TV had a line across the bottom during playback of certain DVD's. From AVS forum research, others experienced this same ""tearing"" problem. Samsung offered to send a Firmware fix on a usb thumb drive for the tearing. There were also contrast issues related to latency or ""gray scale persistence"" when an bright image moved on a dark screen....so I decided to return the unit. I purchased directly from Amazon. Amazon was great in offering a full refund. I have other Samsung products and am generally pleased with Samsung. This product is an exception."
1,NOT compatible with the DCR-DVD7,"This product link needs to be corrected, as the battery contained in the kit is NOT the same battery which is used in the DCR-DVD7. Do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the DCR-DVD7 camera."
2,Dutch Oven,"That is apparently where they cooked this thing up. First of all, there is no ""jewel box"": it's all paper. That's not too big of a deal. Unless you happen to lop off a corner by cutting through the envelope with excitement when the disc arrives in the mail, like I did.But the REAL problem here is the sound of the CD. It's just awful. Especially near the end, where many of the songs become distorted. If you got the levels this bad on a tape you were making for a friend, you'd start over. These guys released it.If you care about experiencing this great album without abominable sound getting in the way, go find another edition."
3,I guess,"This product arrived well packed... it came cardboard backed, plastic/shrink wrapped and inside a box, so I recieved a large box and inside were many small boxes, and inside that was the shrink wrapped little bottles of wisk. The problem is that even with all that packaging these little bottles still leaked. Amazon had no problem sending the replacements, I just wish I fully read the email they sent, they told me not to send the wisk back oh well.The product is okay, a bit drippy and sticky, seems no matter how careful you try to be you still spill a bit, but, in the end it's just laundry soap. I'll finish up this stuff and go back to what I normally use."
4,rare celtic frost live concert footage,interesting ... good sound and picture quality. not excellent but that is because of the age of the concert. unfortunately recorded in the glam-rock period of celtic frost ... no make-up and no black dresses. as a die-hard fan of the old evil songs this video simply made me yawn very often.
4,I agree - Not perfect but very good,"This is a fun computer game. My 3 year old enjoys it, but finds it pretty easy. There are times in her week when such a game fits that bill. I will be buying more copies for gifts. The graphics are a little disappointing."
3,Needs proper OS,If you are putting on a Mac make sure you have Mac OS that runs in 'Classic Mode'. Most Intel Macs won't.
5,"LOVELY, LYRICAL CHRISTMAS RECITAL","Leave it up to wonderful mezzo Anne Sofie von Otter to offer a second enterprising Christmas CD that takes us away from typical carols and songs and present something really musical and interesting. This time it's on an intimate scale, a Christmas recital featuring some recognizable (Max Reger and Peter Cornelius) Christmas lieder, but mostly unfamiliar compositions in a bouquet of languages with the expert accompaniment of pianist Bengt Forsberg. Several times Ms. von Otter yields the soundstage to Mr. Forsberg who plays several piano solos, including his own arrangement of Bach's ""Jesus Joy of Man's Desiring"". This CD offers holiday-bombarded music listeners a quiet respite."
2,Not the Same Product,"Although I have used this product for years, this is the first time I have a problem . This product was packaged differently, although it stated 22%, but it was not. It does not work at all after several application. I am very disappointed with this vendor and this product."
1,Not worth the money.,"I bought this for my treo 700p thinking that it would be great. Far from it. I had it for only two days and sent it back. You can not talk to people using the hands free due to the fact that the other end can not hear you. The speaker was the only plus on the whole unit. You have to use two hands to pry the phone out of the cradle, and if you are not careful the cradle will come unatached from the suction mount. Also for some reason the charger system would not charge my phone properly. I don't believe this was a defective device more than I believe it is poorly made by it's manufactures. All in all I was very dissapointed. The only bonus was that the company I had to return it too was very good at being expediant and courtious. Just a bad product."
5,trimmed down version,"This CD contains 10 of the 12 tracks from Mancini's RCA Victor record ""Combo!"" released in 1960. It is excellent combo jazz a la Mancini -- elegant, deceptively simple, with outstanding players (e.g., Johnny Williams on keyboard)."
4,The only cough syrup that works!,"This stuff WORKS WONDERS! One dose brought immediate relief AND lasted as long as the directions said it would. That's a first for me, with any cough medicine. From now on, I'm sticking with Creomulsion. Despite the effectiveness, I had to give it four stars instead of five, because the taste is vile!"
5,This one works,"If you read the list of ingredients on the back of the box of *all* the cough syrups on display at your local pharmacy/grocery store you'll find that they all rely on the same ingredient for a cough depressant. The one used in Robotusin. For myself, this stuff has no effect what so ever. Even the extra heavy duty version, requiring a prescription from my doctor, didn't quell my discomfort for even a moment. Creomulsion works though. And it helps clear my lungs too. Just because its an old fashioned remedy doesn't mean its not any good."
4,ARTS & CRAFTS FURNITURE Classic to Contemporary,"A very comprehensive book covering both English and American furniture of the classical to recant,evan having some of the author's own furniture on the front cover.This is a book that has created very favourable comments from visitors to our house who have browsed through it during their stay."
3,Furniture evolution,"A visually brief, illustrated history of craftsman-like furniture. There is no concentration on specific manufacturers, but rather an overview of an evolving design ideology."
5,Multi-fun,Fun; educational; all ages! Probably one of the best things for grammom and grandchildren of all ages.
5,great family game,"I purchased this game several years ago when my children were younger, (now they are teenagers). We lost several pieces along the way and decided it was time to get a new set. This is a great family game, and not only does it teach decision making, but math as well. I'm making these claims because each player has to choose from their tiles to determine the best strategic move for himself, and to hinder opponents. At the end of each round each player has to calculate his or her score using addition and subtraction. As a mom, sharpening fundamental math skills through a game of strategy is a ""no brainer."" Just like dominoes, every time you play, Tri-ominoes is a different game with a different outcome. I purchased two games this time around, and gave one as a gift to some friends who enjoy a good game of dominoes when they are camping. The only drawback would be that it is a max of 4 players and there are six in my family."
5,Deluxe Tri-Ominos - a gift for my favorite son-in-law :),"Deluxe Tri-Ominos (In Triangular Tin)The game arrived on time and in perfect condition.I ordered this as a gift for my son-in-law. He tells everyone not to play games with my daughter because she always wins - so I thought I'd give him a chance with this one. LOLThey live in California so the game is on his nightstand in ""their"" room (at our home) waiting for Steve & Josie's next visit."
5,Great travelers map of Oxford UK.,"Has all the major tourists points, the colleges and the streets. Also shows the boat livery's for rentals for punting. The city of Oxford has maps supplied by Blackstone books, but on them is missing a ""You are here"" mark. Also they don't show the spots I wanted to see, but they do show a number of bookstores. So I was still glad to have my own map with me. The nice thing about these maps is their size. Folded, they are about the size of a postcard so are easily carried in a shirt pocket. It's a good deal and if you are visiting you'll be glad you have it."
5,These are great!,"I've purchased these a few times from Amazon and it is a shame that they currently do not have them any more. These are the best ""smores"" type candy I have ever eaten. The combination of flavors is unmatched."
2,Disappointed,Not at all like real s'mores. Chocolate flavor was bland and the overall texture was dry and stale. Tried cold and warmed.
5,Still haven't received it--ordered in Oct. '06!,How can I review this item when you REFUSE to ship it to me?
4,pleasantly surprised,"these are very nice speakers for ipod listening...they don't charge the ipod while connected, however. surprisingly large sound that can fill an apartment with pretty good quality. definately get more than your money's worth and great for trips."
4,"Good Sound, Great Price","Just got these, wish I had gotten them before when I was doing a lot of travelling. For taking with you for a hotel or just for plain travel, they are great. The sound is decent and they work with any iPod out there (I use them with my 2nd Gen iPod).I have used them for only a day, but if they break down like it happened to a previous poster, I'll come back and post. So far, I think they are great, can't beat the price :D"
5,"Durable, portable, amazing sound for size","In July 2006 I purchased these speakers for my first IPOD. Battery life is good. When traveling I hook up my IPOD so we can all hear podcasts, music, or audiobooks. I've used these speakers for sound in group settings (15 people) and after 2 1/2 years it works like new. I'm now on my fifth IPOD and still using the same speakers."
2,Cheap,"Although it was inexpensive, it really wasn't worth the money. It's cheap! I don't like the base, which is a piece of metal. It's not very steady and looks cheesy. Sound is not bad. I would buy this for a kid but would spend the extra money on a better one for an adult."
4,Works Great for Podcasts,"I mainly use these speakers at my desk at work to listen to podcasts (and occasionally music.) I am using a 4th gen iPod; I turn the volume up on the speakers, and the iPod volume is about 50%, it sounds fine.I have had these speakers for about 6 months and they are still terrific. They are portable, and the carrying case is a bonus. I love them!"
4,Perfect for my office,I needed good quality portable speakers for my desk at work and these are perfect. I was considering the MM50 but the truth of the matter is that I wouldn't get to use them to their full potential in a work environment. It is true that these don't get super loud but they have a nice quality sound regardless. I have the 60G iPod video and it fits just fine in the little craddle. The only drawback is that these speakers will not charge your iPod nor does it have a remote.I am very happy with these speakers overall. I love their portability as well.
4,iPod speakers,Item arrived quickly and in the condition promised; pretty good sound for such small speakers. I love the way they pack down - they're very easy to travel with.
5,"Wow, only $29.99?","I can't believe the quality for the price! (Hence, the title.) I just got these today as a Christmas present from my uncle, and they are terrific! The only thing is that he had to yell at the people from TigerDirect because they were listed as in-stock but they really weren't. Also, I like the multipule docks becase it can fit my cousin's iPod Nano, my BFF's Pocket Candy, and my iPod Mini.P.S. I am ten but I like real music like Green Day and despise soda-poppy junk like Hilary Duff!!!"
1,this thing sucks,"I just got this about 2 days ago and im going to return it. When I first tried it out it seemed OK but then the higher you turned up the volume the more distorted it got. When I tried to play metal you couldnt hear anything, it was so distorted.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
5,Great little speakers,"Obviously these are not going blow the roof off your house, but they are really pretty good speakers. Great for listening to music. I'd recommend them to anyone, actually, I have. My boss just ordered the same ones, and one of my co-workers already had them. These are especially good for the price. Again, do not expect a huge subwoofer, but these are good speakers."
3,Not a charger for iPod,"this item is nice, portable but does not recharge your iPod.not that bad after all."
2,Horrible,I bought this station at Walmart for $20.00 and I do not like the sound at all. It is really cheaply made and my the speakers that came with my computer sound better.On the plus side it is very cheap and if you don't care about the sound quality or charging your ipod battery; this could be for you. It isn't worth the retail of $60.00. I wouldn't buy it again.
5,love them,"thay are a great pair of speakers,i love them ,the sound is rich ,and they fill the room with sound,"
4,Good Deal.,Great system for the price. Only thing missing is power for the iPod. Don't forget to adjust the volume on your iPod.
2,Doesn't Fit,"The whole set up is nice, however I just bought my wife a Ipod 60G and it doesn't really fit into the clip. It's very snug and I'm waiting for it to crack and break. Already looking for other speaker systems. But no complaints with the speaker output."
1,Awful Date,"I wanted to use the speakers for a date but they kept blowing on me, so we could never get through a full song. You definitely get what you pay for here, cheapest speakers are worthless. Would never reccomend them."
