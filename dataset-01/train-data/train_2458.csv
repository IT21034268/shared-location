4,Story line & favorite songs,"This album has many really wonderful songs (and a few not so wonderful ones). It is a really passionate and inspiring story about a man with a cocaine problem grieving the death of his mother, broken hearted by his wife leaving him, and coping with the disappointments of his career. I am very glad I chose to purchase this album. It's a great addition to my vast music library of Broadway Show Tunes. Some of my favorite songs are: ""I hate the French"", ""Kindness"", & ""Heart & Soul""."
4,Great Rock Album,"I have only listened to this recording two times through, but I love it. The music and lyrics are so earnest [with the exception of Odeon, which I personally just don't like and garners this recording 4/5 stars] and the real star of this recording is Sherie Rene Scott, who is given beautiful music to showcase her phenomenal voice. Props to Gavin Creel and Christine Ebersole, as well. It's a great recording to have."
2,"Dream cast, nightmare show","All seems to be fair in love and rhymes in this show; some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard. The music? Okay, but can't make up for the soul-stricken lyrics. And what a waste of a great cast: Gavin Creel, Patrick Harris, Christine Ebersole. Why did they record this thing?!"
3,Quite different,"Different enough from the studio version to be worth buying, SOFAD-Live is very emotional and moody, often matching the quality or even outdoing the studio version. The first two tracks especially, are improvements."
4,Powerful Moments,"Admittedly, purchased this item by accident. I ordered it through BMG years ago. I meant to order the studio version. I made myself listen, though. For someone who had previously disdained live album deviations from the relative perfection of studio production, this album opened my eyes. The wash of crowd response, especially to ""Walking in My Shoes"" and ""I Feel You,"" gave me shivers. I learned for the first time to appreciate a live album because of this ""mistake."" The music does drag in places, but wherever the performance might lack, the production is still very well done. For these reasons, I give the overall album 4 stars."
2,Eh...,"I'd say Depeche Mode's SOFAD Live is pretty much on par with its studio counterpart (with some minute exceptions; some for the better, but more for the worse). If you are racking your brain trying to decide which to buy, I advise the studio version, but I should point out that ""I Feel You"" and ""Mercy in You"" are slightly better and work better with the somewhat rougher recordings. Everything else's a different matter, though. The dodgey sound quality of the backing music to ""In Your Room"" and ""Judas"" does zero for either song and sound very bad compared to the polished studio versions. If you're a crazy DM completist, buy SOFAD Live, but it's not worth it.2.5 stars"
2,"Not bad, but not really worth it...","While hearing live material is always cool, this CD has no use except to be a promo for anybody who has never been to a Depeche Mode concert (or anybody who hasn't heard 101). The SoFaD album live? While some of the live versions are cool to listen to, it's better to get the original album, and the singles. If they had to do a live album, they should have included more than just the songs from SoFaD. This should have been ""The Devotional Tour"". That would make it worth the money, otherwise it really has no purpose."
2,Not a Must-Have,"If there's any album in their entire catalog to be considered non-essential, this is a strong contender. It's not as though every track on the studio version of the album was a hit. Furthermore, die hard fans may be far more interested in some of the older material from previous tours. It can be argued that even though they were experimenting with a new sound, the public didn't care about it that much. If you make a list of what DM albums you want, place this at the bottom. It doesn't get any worse than this."
2,Where has the old Mode gone?,"Being a devout DM fan, I of course bought this album. My thinking was that 101 was outstanding, why shouldn't this be? I ordered it and waited for a long time. When it finally arrived at the door, I eagerly threw it into the stereo. I was greatly disappointed.So, lesson for all you other collectors out there: if you have to buy this, leave it until last. It sounds more like a warped recording than a great live concert."
2,Don't waste your time.,I am a big fan of Depeche Mode but this album is unnecassary. It's exactly the same album as the studio version of SOFAD but the songs on here don't sound as good as the studio versions. This is not really an essential even for die hard fans.
2,Distressed Mode,"Released within a year of the studio ""Songs Of Faith And Devotion,"" this live cash-in presents the songs of that album, in the studio album's running order, and nothing else. Bearing in mind that ""SoFaD"" was not exactly Depeche Mode's shining achievment, either in the songwriting or album performance department, you may find yourself asking, ""what's the point?"" You'd also be justified in asking said question, and the answer is, NONE.Given two stars becuase DM are a great live band, but ""DM101"" and ""Devotional"" will give you far more bang for your buck."
4,Terrific Album,"I haven't listened to this album since I got out of grad school ten years ago, but now that my iPod needs filling, I burned it onto my hard drive. Funny - the album art called up in Windoz Media player was wrong. Exploring the Web, I found out for the first time that DM released these songs twice, and I just happened to have bought the live version. Since I didn't know any better, I just enjoyed the music, which has the raw power of a live performance. I'd forgotten the sound, but I won't forget again. I sympathize with those who felt ripped off by the two releases, but if you didn't buy the first one, you should get the second one. And turn up the volume."
4,Solid Watch,"I have owned this watch for years. I did have an issue with the Chronograph when I first bought it, but Tissot repaired it for me free of charge. Over all I am very happy with this."
1,No Illustrations,This is a well written book....but there are no illustrations in the Kindle edition! I have just ordered the paperback because the points the author puts forth make sense with the art work. I suggest that Amazon remove this Kindle offering because all it ultimately does is disappoint. Buy the book....you will not be disappointed with that!
3,"Old book, but few are like it.","Professional writers (I am a lawyer.) need to learn logical structure when every word counts. This book helps. Do's and don'ts are blessedly rare. The book is textish, and I hope that someone will write on the logical structure of successive paragraphs, the paragraph itself, and finally the structure of the sentences."
2,"O.K., but a bit disappointing","The book gives a decent overview of the British Marines in the War for American Independence. But too many broad generalizations, no footnoting, and some facts are wrong (Marine Light Companies did go on Lexington/Concord March, Battle of Penobscot Bay had Marines, but main British units involved were the 72nd and 84th Foot). The book does have a pretty good bibliography. If interested in the role of the Marines in the American Revolution, The Lost War, a collection of letters from British Officers to the Earl of Something or other in England, gives a good account of the Marines in Boston and Halifax during the War."
4,""" 'Gubg Ho' "" for the Bullocks",This slim book told me more about the Royal Marines than years of reading about Hornblower or Jack Aubry and countless books about the Royal Navy. A Marine made more than a soldier because of fewer stoppages of pay was new for instance. Marine officers didn't buy their rank. All sorts of information that I never thought to wonder about. A good buy for the price.
3,It's better than nothing,"Despite what you may have read, this book doesn't cover any Jeeps that Patton may have ridden in. It covers civilian jeeps (CJ's) only. It's not very useful for restoration because it doesn't offer enough detail on what was stock. Like most Chilton's, it assumes that you know the basics. It also has the usual typos and index problems."
1,YOU ARE NOT SAVING ANYTHING- Lamp is under thirty bucks RETAIL,"NOT A $80.00 LAMP.!!! Beware, this lamp is from Linens and Things and has a preprinted tag on the box listing it as $29.99. This is not a bargain at all. I just rec'd the lamp. Thinking I was getting a super duper deal, it is a super duper dud. Cheap Lamp, Worth maybe $8-$11 dollars at most. Very surprised at Amazon for listing this incorrectly."
5,wow! a great table/lamp at a fantastic price!,"the quality of this item is great.. i the desk is made out of glass, very easy to assemble, overall all the product was exactly as stated!"
5,Worth every penny!!!,"I was a little hesitent about spending $40 on a case but after putting the eVo3 case on my Video Ipod I couldn't be happier. I just sold my Nano(which was all scratched up) and bought the Video. It went straight into the case and I can't see how it could possibly get scratched. The ipod is completely covered, the case is very tight, looks very clean. The hold button is covered but if you have a fingernail its not hard to switch it. The wheel is covered and I was worried it might not be as responsive but you can't even tell, it works perfect!!!!"
3,"This product would be better if the ""hold"" switch cover actually worked.",Please note the product is only under warranty for 3 months. That says something about how long the manufacturer expects it to last even though it has all kinds of claims of amazing durability.It does fit well and it does not scratch the ipod.
4,PRETTY GOOD!!!,"This is a very secure case nice grip,plastic platefor protection and this membrane over the click wheel!!!!It took 5 days to get here wich is reasonable....it looksslightly different then the picture ..... READ THE DIRECTIONSOR YOU COULD HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING THE PLATE IN LIKE I DID!!!Overall:Good!"
4,"Pretty Good, but attracts A LOT of lint","I'm rather impressed that this case protects every part on the ipod. The only exposed part is the headphone jack. It even has a removeable flap that covers the dock connecter when not in used. However, like most reviewers said, it attracts lint like crazy. When I 1st opened the product, I placed it on my bed, and when I picked it up again, it was covered with lint. I've actually considered using this to brush the lint off some of my slacks. Other than the lint problem, it is a very good skin. The hold button is harder to switch on/off with the case, but not impossible. I do have to dig my nail in order to switch it. Overall, I feel that my ipod is well protected with this skin."
2,Not at all satisfied,"I'm honestly puzzled that anyone could be happy with this case. First of all, it is very difficult to insert the iPod into the iSkin, and the iSkin does not fit tightly over the plastic insert. I cannot get it to stay wrapped around the iPod, the edges keep peeling back. Secondly, there is no hole in the iSkin to access the hold button, which I would assume many iPod owners make frequent use of. On the whole, this seems to me a poorly designed and overpriced product."
1,None of the attachments fit!,"Well, the pros - it looks cool, seems to protect well and the silicone cover for the click wheel actually works better when attached than without the cover.But the cons FAR outweigh the pros. Unless you plan on only using Ipod brand headphones, don't bother with this product. Anything larger - connection for the car, connection to watch videos on the tv, etc. - they don't fit in the small space to plug it in. You have to take the top of the cover off to plug anything in. Docking stations also do not fit, because the flap on the bottom of the cover is extremely hard to hold back while plugging it in. Once you take the skin off, it's not that easy to put it on again!I purchased this about 2 weeks ago, and I'm going today to buy a new cover. Absolutely not worth your money.I would have rated it 2 stars, but I thought 1 was neccessary to effect the overall score."
4,Works great,"I've had this product for about almost two years and its protected my ipod from many, many drops, and sand, dirt etc... Please note that it's not waterprrof so walk on the shore at your own risk. The turn wheel works perfectly though the skin. I've never had a problem with the sensitivities as other ipod cases do. The reason I've rated is 4 stars instead of 5 is that after two years of use the belt clip has broken free of the case so I need a new one."
4,"Great case, but has a few tears after one year","I've had an evo3 case for my 30GB iPod for a little over a year now, and despite my extremely gentle treatment of the iPod, the case has developed some tears. It has a hole in the thin silicone over the hold button, which tore the one and only time I used the hold switch. The flap for covering the plug at the bottom of the ipod has also begun tearing at both sides of its edges. Also, some dirt has managed to get in under the clickwheel and screen plastic, but it is minimal.I'll probably end up replacing the case with yet another evo3, however, since the case is fantastic otherwise. I even like the clip and use it regularly!"
5,Just what I wanted,"This case has everything you could want. It may not have the shock protection some cases do, but it's more than enough unless you plan to use your iPod as a baseball. It's a bit bulkier than I expected, but still fits in your pocket fine. I also recommend completely removing the belt clip. It's easier to put the case in your pocket where it's more secure. It also makes the iPod easier to handle on your desk, table, etc. The iPod ports are protected yet accessible.Excellent product."
5,EVO3 iSkin,"I was looking for a protective case for my sister's video Ipod, and after reading most of the reviews, I purchased the Evo3. It works as advertized. The one thing I would change is the access to the hold button. With the Eclipse iSkin, you can't tell if the hold is on or off. That being said, I would buy another if I get a video Ipod myself. It improves the look of the Ipod, (in my opinion) and the lint factor is not a problem."
5,Ubeatable iPod skin.,"Simply the best! Looks, protection, skin-tight fit - i've tried others on my 3G & 4G iPods but this skin simply beats the competition. I first choose a black one for my black iPod but it was predictably opaque and looked heavy - impossible to tell what color iPod was underneath. so I opted for a semi-transparent version.Just a minor gripe - too bad this splendid iSkin isn't also available in fully-transparent mode."
3,What click wheel protective membrane?,"It's a great case but mine did not come with a click wheel protective covering, so I'm giving it a 3."
1,unhappy,"the advertisment was misleading---the wallet was advertise as a ""Coach"" product when it is not a ""Coach"" product---you can not tell from the picture that it is not a ""Coach"" wallet"
4,An Underrated Gem,"An enjoyable album, with expert production by Rupert Hine. Some nice songs such as Break the Chain, World of Mirrors, The Low Hum of Machines, and the remarkable Love Changes This. Very life-affirming music, though I am not entirely sure that the band had all that much to say beyond relatively obvious observations. As I implied, it's not a very challenging album, though I suspect that that wasn't the point, and would probably distract. One By One By One (named from a lyric from Break the Chain) is a good listen, and that's what it's all about."
2,"Looks great, but broke in about a year","The handle looks great and has a nice feel to it, but it broke within about a year. The juncture where the lever connects to the rod is soft brass and it just split apart. Price is great at $18. Almost tempted to buy the exact same thing in hopes that it lasts longer, but cannot bring myself to do it since it broke so quickly."
1,blow out the candle,"I'm sorry to say that this is a sure-fire flop CD. And, listen, I was a fan, but I've got to give an honest review. This music is so sappy that it's embarrassing to listen to -- unless you're a 15yr old girl (and hey, maybe that's their market now). I couldn't even get through the entire CD twice! Where's the punch and anger that drove their 1st CD? I wasn't expecting grunge (we all know that that's dead), but these songs have absolutely zero edge. The writing is silly and rehashed, and is reminiscent of the late 80s post-glamrock ballad frenzy (ever heard of Tesla?). And they actually had the nerve to thank RUSH in the liner-notes -- are you guys kidding me?!"
5,Don't Call 'Em Chick Rock,"A more toned down version of their 1st album, filled with soaring Kevin Martin vocals and sinewy guitar-courtesy of Peter Klett, it should have been their second(instead of the ill-conceived Lucy). Producer Ron Nevison(of Bad Co. and Zeppelin fame) gives the band a sound very reminiscent of those classic rock giants, without sounding dated. No easy task. The ""never wanna slow down"" chorus of ""10,000 Horses was made for arenas. The Zeppelin-esue title track being no different. The afforementioned Bad Co. is evoked on Blinders(think ""Feel Like Makin' Love,"") and the top down acoustic rocker ""Breakaway."" In fact the only misstep here is the fact this album wasn't released at the beginning of the decade, instead of near the end of it."
5,Perfect as usual,"""predictable blues-rock passages"" - This was from the editorial review! The funny thing about it is that, that is what's so great about them. They shouldn't have tried to hit the looser grunge fad market of listeners who dont know or appreciate the blues and couldn't recognize the great talent candlebox has for a great bluesy back beat.They remind me of the Black Crowes, a great talent that was marketed wrong!"
4,This is a four star great album!,"Candlebox has a flattened name that intends to bring fire, this album does that but there are limitations to its greatness. If you like their first album, then this is essential. Lucy is weird, let me listen again tonight. But Stones Throw Away is Awesome! Also, 'Breakaway' is cool and 'Sometimes' is pop blues in a good way, but they are not perfect songs. But this album is better than the Stones with the Dust Brothers. Enjoy the blues within a contemporary meaning and none of the frantic realization of the first, except some of it...."
5,HAPPY PILLS - One of the few CLASSICS of 1998,"It took me awhile to purchase this album but when I did, WOW! What change. What growth. WHAT AN ALBUM!!! Candlebox surprises here for sure. Just when everybody thought they were going away, BAM! Happy Pills comes out and is truly a dynamic and amazing album. They cover all of their musical bases on this release. It's cool, you cannot only hear where they've been but you can also hear where they're going, musically that is. I highly recommend purchasing this Cd. Happy Pills will be a classic. The best yet by cbox!"
5,"If you are a fan of great music, you must have this CD!","If you love true rock music, you must hear this CD!! When I feel aggressive, I play Metallica and love it!! Happy Pills has the same effect when I want to relax. It is that great!! Pearl Jam is good--but Happy Pills are better!"
4,B15 Brooks Saddle,My first Brooks saddle. Always wondered what all the hoopla was about for this expensive saddle. Now I know. This is the most comfortable saddle I've ever ridden on. The extra expense and weight is well worth it. Great support for my middle aged sit bones. No more pain on century rides.
5,Worth the price,"I have around 10K on my brooks swift saddle with Ti rails. Unfortunately the adjustment pin in the front of the saddle snapped recently and I had to go back to a more conventional saddle I just had laying round. The brooks was double century comfortable for me, so good I honestly never thought much about it. My replacement seat Sucks to the point that I am blowing off rides. It is unfortunate that the tension bold broke, but hell after that many miles a $15 part does not seem that bad.If you spend time on your bike, this is a worthwhile investment.The brooks saddle is truly a 5 star item.Frank"
5,Wow,I ordered this for my retro-inspired BMX for a little of that hipster cred. Once I actually sat on it I was amazed at the comfort level. It's amazing compared to the miserable plastic pivotal seats I'm used to. It feels so good to my rearend that it should be wearing a condom.
2,Cover tedious to apply & requires constant readjustments,"Quality cover protects all elements of the Ipod G5 Video. My problems are 1) the rubber skin is difficult to pull on and 2) the plastic front difficult to fit correctly. 3) The cover for the hold button is not 'raisable' so the cover has to be pulled back to move the hold button into and out of position. 4) The cover is heavy and has to be removed to fit in the Bose dock and, finally, 5) there's no way to actually carry the Ipod with this cover. The belt clip is less than effcient for the heavier model. In sum the cover is tedious to use and requires constant adjustments."
3,nice,"seems to work well, decent price point, heavy duty and looks like good quality. micro setting is a bit hard to be sure that you have the proper setting - not too bad but not real clear"
4,"great movie, not so much for physical quality","I received the video with a proper box showing the cover art, unfortunately the physical quality of the product was not up to par since I was not able to view it at all. After contacting amazon and the seller, I was entirely reimbursed for the defective product and the matter was no problem at all. VHS is definitely out-of-date"
4,Dexter's First movie,"This movie was featured on Cartoon Network in the summer of 2000. In this movie, Dexter travels forward into time and unites with his futures selves to battle with the his arch rival, Mandark. Dexter finds a bleak world where Mandark has removed all the technology but his own."
2,Warning: you will lose certain channels if using coax,"this unit boasts of surge protected coax input and splitter, where you connect your cable (or sat cable) into the unit, then the signal is split in two, one output going to your TV or receiver, the purpose being protection against lightning strikes and surges that travel thru coax lines. BUT I've lost SEVERAL channels, mainly premium and HD, with that hookup. this has been mentioned in older forums. it does not seem , as of today, that APC has any solution. or explanation."
5,Provides clean power and clearer audio,"I purchased this power conditioner for my home theater, which consists of a Samsung LCD television, a top-of-the-line Onkyo Receiver, a PS3, an XBox, a Wii, and an Apple TV. I've been using the conditioner for about 9 months and have had no problems whatsoever with it. It does an excellent job keeping the power input at the proper level and also seems to result in a slightly clearer sound (most noticeable when listening to music) than I'd had with the standard Monster power strip I used previously. It's also fairly nice to look at. I have no complaints with it, but should note that it takes up a lot of space (it's about the size of an old 5-disc rotating CD-player) and is fairly heavy--quite a change for someone used to traditional power strips."
5,Really glad I ordered it,"We live out in the country and have long suspected that our electrical service might be the reason for some electronic failures in the house. So, before shelling out the bucks for our big screen, I wanted the peace of mind that it would be protected. Well, this unit does the job. It is trimming the line voltage more often than not. While I cannot compare this others I can say it is easy to use, looks good in the AV cabinet, and provides assurance that my home theater equipment is protected."
5,APC H15,"This is a very nice piece of equipment. Very simple, very well designed and exactly what I needed to protect my investmant. I was initially concerned that it would not have enough current handling capacity for my amps, receiver, plasma and other electronics, but has not even come close to the 15 amps that it is rated for, most of the time runs about 6 or 7 amps. Very pleased and would recommend to others looking for a great power conditioner/surge protector.Thanks."
3,Maybe # 3 is a charm,"Product was defective out of the box as led light on display was inoperative. Called and Schneider Electric (maker of APC) sent another. The new until appears to function normally, but LED display was damaged by what looked like someone failing to remove plastic over LCD in inside of faceplate making reading the display very difficult. Called Schneider again and 3rd unit is on its way. Pain in the rear but Schneider has been helpful in fixing the problem so far. They need to greatly tighten their quality control (even though each unit comes with a printout of test and ""passed"" certificate)."
5,Awesome,"I really like this unit. Looks great, fits in with the other black components. Really adds a lot of confidence that my high end stereo components and big screen are protected. The readout of current and other information is slick. I would definitely recommend this product. It is very well built and of high quality."
1,tripe and blather,"For you young hipsters out there keen to tune in to the happening scene, you need to ask yourself whether you want to be an idiot while doing it. If you do intend to reduce your thinking to what is obvious, boring, or plain moronic, THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU!!!On the other hand, if you want to understand how the world works, turn away from the colossally stupid whenever you can - and a good start is not buying this piece of crap album."
5,powerful musically and lyrically,"There are many reviews posted already that describe why this is such a great record...so I won't go into too much detail. Yes, the lyrics are a little heavy-handed, but the band manages to touch on a lot of weighty issues in a pretty small space. The music builds a sense of tension which, with the lyrical content, produces a feeling of barely controlled fury.The only warning I would have is that some might be turned off by the tone of the singers voice. I think it's perfect for the record however. He has a vocal delivery and tone that sounds both snotty and wise...and how often do you get to use those two words together to describe something?"
2,Not impressed,"I`ve read widely on the subject of coaching and was very disappointed by this effort by Skiffington and Zeus. Having enjoyed reading the likes of Tim Gallwey, Bruce Peltier, James Flaherty and others expressing their views on coaching; learning something new, making slight adjustments to my own approach, I had high hopes but The Complete Guide to Coaching at Work didn`t impress me at all.This is one of the those books that appears, at first glance to be a sustantial piece of work, yet by the time you get to the end you wonder if the authors know anything about their subject. I suspect they do, so must conclude they just wrote a poor book.Best to look elsewhere I guess."
5,Finally!,"I have red under eye circles. Very red. When my boyfriend first saw me without makeup, he thought I had allergies or something! I have tried to find a good concealing product for YEARS and have always had problems...not enough coverage, cakey, wears off too soon, I wrote off concealer...until I found this product and the folks at Sephora were nice enough to give me a sample.THIS PRODUCT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED UNDER MY EYES. The circles are GONE all day; I almost forget I have them! It is very thick, so you need a light tough to start.The color is very natural on my skin, which is something I have never been able to say about a concealing product before.I dont spend a lot of money on makeup, so I consider this little splurge totally worth it."
4,Pretty good,It's so hard to find a perfect concealer. This isn't perfect- it does get a little cakey if you don't apply it with a brush. I only use the yellower side of the concealer as it matches my skin better. That being said it is much better than most other concealers out there.
5,Effective coverage,Very pleased with the camouflage. It evens out my skin tone nicely. Could be used as a base foundation in a pinch.
3,Good news and bad news..,"Good is:- The radio signal between the two units is good. It works good enough in my house to go about 45' line of sight. 35' around walls.- The unit that repeats the signal at your remote device (i.e. DVR, DVD player, stereo receiver) works well. I use mine from 15' with no problem.Bad is:- The sensitivity of the IR receiver(the devise that you point your IR remote at) is narrow and low. So don't expect to stand more than 6 - 7' away from the very front of the IR reciever with your IR remote control and make it work. It won't. I've tried a couple of different remotes and have the exact same problem. So either get over it or don't bother to purchase it.The other bad news is that I've tried other wireless devises like this and they have similar problems. The best devise that I used was the NexGen. It worked well. However, it only works with most remotes that take AA or AAA batteries. One of mine doesn't and that is my problem."
2,Not adequate,Range from transmitter (IR receiver) to receiver (IR blaster) is ok.Range from IR remote (any of mine) to the transmitter (IR receiver) is two feet or less.Don't bother with this.Buy the Terk Leapfrog LFIRX.It looks better - and it actually works!Range of my remote to their receiver is very good - at least 15 feet.Range of their blaster from their receiver is good.Their plug in blaster is very powerful (so much so that I couldn't figure out which surface was the front!)/http://www.amazon.com/Terk-Leapfrog-Remote-Control-Extender/dp/B000069EV0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1277622850&sr;=8-2
1,do not waste your time and money.,"the frist one did not work well, and now the second pair does not work well. very cantankerious, very. works when it wants to."
1,DO NOT BUY,"this remote extenter works as well at doing what it stats as a waffle iron. seriously, if you want to test one out before you buy one, just go outside point your remote towards my house (west tn) press a button on your remote and see if it works. there you have it a live unbiased demo of the efecttivety of this thing."
1,Avoid this product from Amazon - 2 sets did not work,"I gave up after the second set proved to be dead on arrival. First one had a bad power supply. Not sure about second set transmitter appeared dead. Kudos to Amazon customer service return and refund no fuss, muss, or bother...the reason why I prefer to do business with Amazon."
3,Wireless Remote Extender,It didn't work as stated for my need. I have a large house and maybe to large for this application.
4,Buying it again,"Today I'm buying ImmunPlex again.So far, I've tried 3-4 different brands,because I'm still trying the different undenatured whey products.Most of the ones I've tried seem to do what they're supposed to, that is,provide the needed raw materials to help our bodies produce glutathione.The differences I'm seeing are price, taste, and mixability.The ImmunPlex is the easiest to mix, at least in water and ""Rice Dream"".I started doubling up on the dosage, and it seems to really be helping.I haven't used my nebulizer in nearly a week.[Watch; now I'll have an attack.]The price is lower than anything else I've tried,except the stuff I found at Kroger's, which does *not* taste very good.Since ImmunPlex mixes so well,I'm mixing it with other brands to improve their mixability.The 10% price reduction isn't much, but it helps with the shipping,and it makes ImmunPlex the least expensive of all the brands I've tried.I think its a good product, especially considering the price."
5,John Michael Montgomery's music is Inspiring!,John Michael Montgomery's music is inspiring. His music relates to things that I have been through. Through his words I see just where I have been and what I have done. His words go beyond that of just music.
2,"Check out song five from Queer as Folk, discard the rest",I like song number 5 on the CD but have to admit that stuff coming from the UK seems to be a bit better than this CD. I like the DJ when he performs at Traffic/Icon but was not overly impressed by this CD of only nine songs.

1,It was a waste of money!,It does not fit in hall glasses in special those that we use for riding a bike. It was a waste of money!
2,Bike Mirror,I find this third eye eyeglass hard to connect to glasses and hard to adjust when riding the bike and being able to see anything. I cannot recommend it.
3,double vision,"This particular third Eye Eyeglass Bicycle Mirror did not fully meet all of my expectations. I didn't notice how short it was from the add on line . Frankly, I didn't know that its length would be a problem until I tried it on . I bought the third eye eyeglass bicycle mirror for roller skating on city streets or the greenline (skating/biking strip) . But, I had to close one eye to focus in the mirror. And it became difficult changing focus from the third eye in the rear to two eyes in the front. If I closed one eye to see in the rear then I couldn't see up front and visa versa . Trying to look through the third eye ,with both eyes open ,seemed to create double vision before my eyes refocused. I think the arm of this product need to be 1 or 2 inches longer and the mirror need to be a little bigger with a square design."
2,nice but it doesn't last.,"After two months, one of the tabs broke off, no rough treatment, just normal use. Would not buy again, something made out of metal is likely to be much more durable."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Crappy design, flimsy and cheap. Does not give you full vision because the frame is in the way. Junk.Trash. Crap."
3,Works great until it breaks,"Had this mirror for a year until it broke last week. Worked great, light, easy to adjust and the view is very clear. The mount should be redesigned. I am debating now whether to get a second one or a Take A Look (at the time I tried both and liked the Third Eye more)."

4,Watch Your Back,"Easy to clip/attach onto most eye glass wear. Use it when traveling as well as bicycling. When traveling it aids as a ""watch your back"" for pick pocket scams. The only improvement would be if it were more of an oval design and about 1/4 inch longer on the mirror extension."
4,Third Eye Eyeglass,The mirror works well and can be adjusted easily. They do break over time but can be fixed by the compamy for a small fee.
4,"The mirror is great, just a tad bit small.","The product as a whole is much better than I had expected, especially from the price of it. The clips fit on much better than I had expected and will stay on in all practical circumstances. The range of its ability to swivel is much greater than I had anticipated, and it is articulating both in the jointed attachment of the arms to the clips and the jointed attachment of the mirror to the arm. The only thing it is lacking a bit of is the viewing area of itself, but only for larger areas, focusing on a road is no problem (being what they were designed for)."
1,No functional details,"Unfortunately this product does not come with any details on how to attach it to your sunglasses. I spent at least 1/2 hour looking at the picture on the package, then tried to attach it to the sunglasses according to the picture, but when I put the sunglasses on, it did not allow the proper adjustment so I could see traffic behind me while biking. In the end, I took it off so I wouldn't get in an accident trying to adjust my head to see traffic behind me. This was a waste of $$."
3,Could be more durable,I have owned 1/2 dozen of these over the years and they tend to last no more than a season. Plastic attachment tabls fatigue and break off. Works great when it works. I usually keep a spare since there is no warning when it breaks and I have come to depend on the mirror. Mirror is also a little heavy. My sunglassess ride crooked with the mirror attached. So I will try a different brand next time.
2,not durable enough,My first mirror lasted a month until the plastic broke with minimal manipulation. Found I really love having a mirror but will try a different brand looking for more durability.
3,Wanted to love it... but can't...,"As other's noted, these will SNAP if you have glasses with a thicker arm on them (as most ""aero"" cycling sunglasses like Rudy, Oakley, Native, Scott etc etc)... I went through 3 in 3 months... have now sucked it up and bought a competitor's product that has brass supporting an acrylic mirror...love it."
3,Good enough for ten bucks,"Once I figured out how to get it in position without having to strain my eyeballs to look all the way to the left (move the dang mirror further to the right, silly) I found it to be a good-enough rear view mirror, for the price. The way that it attaches to my sunglasses makes it attach sideways rather than upright like in the product picture, but I can still make it work. Someone should tell the product designer that sporty sunglasses don't usually have skinny little frames. There are little rubber pads on the two outer gripper-arms which slide off and fall in the grass never to be seen again, but they weren't doing much anyways. My prediction for the future of my cheap little rear view mirror involves duct tape.** Update after 1 Year **I left them on my glasses overnight and the forked attachment broke. Yes, duct tape or cable ties might make it work again but I think I'll treat myself to the ""Safe Zone Bicycle Helmet Mirror"" as a replacement, instead."
5,Excellent book,Book breaks down how to quelch a counterinsurgency. More people in the Pentagon and Washington need to read it.
5,Works great,"it works really good, and the driver adds easy to use links to the ""send to"" option when you right-click files in XP. It also adds a button to Internet Exploder."
3,Oops! No Vista x64 support...,"Don't buy this if you're planning on using it with Vista x64 (64-bit edition of Vista). There aren't any drivers. And Vista barely works with Bluetooth as it is. Heck, Vista barely works as it is.If I were running this on WindowsXP (which I have done), I would give it five stars. It does seem to work and Belkin's drivers are cruft-free with nice clean interfaces with nary a garish skin in sight! Bless them for not making crummy, cluttered interfaces.Vista x64 user? 0 stars.XP user? 5 stars!"
4,Great for the price,"I bought this in 2007, just after Windows Vista was out. Didn't work with it out of the box, but it did after I downloaded the drivers from the Belkin Support website. When I connected it on a PC running Windows 7, a few years later, I didn't have to do anything, Windows 7 installed the drivers automatically."
4,Little work,I have XP and Vista systems installation on the Vista System took a little extra work on getting it to work correctly on the system and my cell phone.

5,Colette's Prayer by Deva Gantt,"This was an amazing book, from the beginning to the end. The writers made the characters so real you felt you were right there with them. The story line was also great. I did not want to put the book down. The description was also so vivid. Looking forward to your next book.M Pizzonia. Vicki's Mom"
1,What dreck!,"These girls vanity printed a book that couldn't get printed on it's own. There's a reason, the books lacks anything called writing. It is a historical load of garbage that is surrounded by meiocre writing. Let's not even discuss the fact that rumor has it the book was originaly 900 pages but had to be cut down... yeah for the sake of it's readers. Save your money and buy a book that actually was worth the paper it was placed on. And consider when you are wondering if you should buy it or not, why did the author (one of them) have to review her own work? The sisters need to go back to the typewriter and destory it. Sorry, that's just the truth of the matter."
2,Background music for the jazz-challenged,"Picked this up in order to sample Sample, and found it to be pretty much easy-listening blended with a touch of funk. There's very little of interest here in terms of either style or chops. If you're into ""smooth"" jazz, you'll probably like it, but fans of the real thing are warned away. Pleasant, inoffensive background music."
2,Not for Southern Hemisphere Dwellers,"This book might be useful for northern hemisphere dwellers but not so much for southerners. The recipes are not metric and refer to ingredients that I have not heard of(single cream?). There are many songs but unless you can read music there is no way of knowing the tune. And of course the songs and poems all relate to seasons,animals and plants of the northern hemisphere. There are still useful bits of information for me but I have to pick and choose carefully. Some of the festivals refer more to the christian history rather than the celtic or pagan origins for example under the heading""Candlemas"" there is no mention that it is the Celtic festival of First Light instead it refers only to ""...the feast of the presentation of Christ in the Temple...""etc. As a non-christian this turns me off. Quite an old fashioned book as far as crafts and songs go but this seems to be in keeping with Waldorf Steiner philosphy. So if that's what you want enjoy!"
3,I liked the itdea but not this book.,"I found this book did not meet my expectations. I was delighted to find that the book All Year Round was just what I was expecting and enjoyed it much more. Great ideas, but a bit cluttered."
3,a dated book of little use here in the states.,"this book seems like a good idea, but most of the content is outdated and with european holidays and songs, it's of little use for us here in the states.there are a few good recipes but not enough to warrant the purchase of the book."

2,General Business Management Issues,Mostly tells about general business management rules or pratices. Many of them can be applied to any management position. Not specific to CIO concept.
1,CIO suicidal guide,"Some genreic guidelines about management, that can be applied to any mid level managerial position. And the rest is proposing to 'Align IT strategy with Business Strategy', without telling how to do it.The book also suggests to ask your CEO ""what do you expect from me as a CIO""!. It is like asking, say, your wife ""what do expect from me as a husband!"".Not one word about IT Governance, the best practices like ITIL, COBIT, CMMI or the certification processes like ISO, etc.It does have few interesting figures- all taken from other sources.Immagine a book called 'how to fly a plane' but only teaches you how to talk to passengers... This is how this book is related to CIO."
3,Screaming eagles,"This is a very entertaining book about the ""Bad Boy Squad"" of the 101st Airborne Division during the siege of Bastogne. A good read!"
4,"Arabian Legends, USA","As a reader from NZ, I found this book readable, informative and full of wonderful and interesting pictures. The ""human interest"" stories about breeders finding their ""hearts delight"" form part of the text - and as one scrolls through the book, the role of the owner in the fate and fame of each horse is revealed as the true catalyst in their journey to immortality. A very interesting book, but the quality of the binding is poor. GJMD NZ South Pacific"
5,opened my eyes,"My doctor recommended this book and others by Sherry Rogers. I have been in treatment for metal toxicity (i.v. chelation therapy) and it has entirely changed my health. I had become hyper sensitive to everything! I was even beginning to wonder if it was all in head (that's that a lot of doctors will tell you when they don't know), because day by day another set up symptoms would show up. Since I have lowered my toxin levels, even my seasonal allergies have cleared up! I suffered for many, many years. This book makes the issues clear and should help anyone suffering with health problems and who is looking for answers. Detox, detox, detox. It works!"
5,superior book,"I am a breast cancer survivor and find myself extremely sensitive to fragrances, laundry products, cleaning products, etc. I have ready many things trying to figure out WHY this happens to me, and what to do. This book explains both. This MD had it herself and treats it. In addition, it gets down to a cellular analysis on why it takes place and what you can do about it. Lots of references. Superior book...a MUST HAVE !"
2,Chemical Sensitivity,I have read several of Sherry Roger's books and find them all very informative. We need to take a look at why we are sick and the possible culprits. Alternative health care. This booklet was about the toxic things we live with everyday.
2,Review of Chemical Sensitivity,"I think the few pages that this pamphlet contain are grossly over priced. Tbe merchandise was delivered in a timely manner, but I was disappointed in regard to the merchandise."
2,This is the least useful of the Classic Beer Style series.,"It is difficult to read and make sense of the facts in this book. The history of the beer style is hard to follow. Information is presented in a scattered fashion, and ranges from extreme detail in some areas to glossing over other points."
1,five points,"I love the book. Howver, I ordered two copies. One came in excellent condition. the other book was advertised as having no dust cover and slight marks on the binding with no markings on the inside. In reality, the book has underlingings all through the entire book. Very disapointing for the price."
3,I wish the book was as interesting as its subtitle,"Gee, this sounds off like such a negative comment, but I wish the book lived up to the hectic, colorful, and unpredictable nature of its subject. I was hammered by useless stats that were out of touch with the immediate subject. AND YET, this book should be regarded as invaluable to any student of the area or of 19th century urban politics. Get passed the stats, and you got yourself and easy read."
4,"great as dvd, but where are the ""3"" video games?","This is the beginning of a great thing to have as a parent. My daughter loves the 10 episodes. However, she noticed that on the box cover, it states that there are 3 games in this dvd. I cannot find them and there is no website or phone number to ask the common "" how do I?"" questions. All in all, this is a great dvd if you enjoy sitting with your kids and watching tv together."
4,The Power Puff Girls: Birthday Bash DVD,"Birthday Bash was a good DVD.It contained 2 of my favourite episodes:'Down 'n' Dirty and 'Paste makes waste.'In'Down 'n' Dirty' Buttercup refuses to take a bath and once she got really dirty she made the town,her school and even her own house smell.Buttercup gets kicked out of town.After she flies away she fights with a monster she saw.After the fight the monster goes home and tells Buttercup that she stinks and makes her go home and have a bath so that she can fight monsters again.'Paste makes waste is about a boy at 'Pokey Oaks Kindergarten' called Elmer Sglue who eats glue.He is teased by Mitch,Buttercup and the twins Floyd & Lloyd.Them and the rest of the class(except Blossom and Bubbles)call him ""Paste eater"".Later on Elmer gets very angry and turns into a paste monster and he goes to destroy the town.The only way for Elmer to stop destroying the town is by Buttercup saying she's sorry.She finally says it and Elmer and Buttercup are now friends."
2,Not very good.,"WHY does Buttercup h8 baths?Maybe she is a STUPID GIRL!The others are better cuz they love baths.Me,too,I love baths.But I luv baths the most!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They make you clean,Plus a Shower does."
4,Finding the Magic,"The book is lighthearted. Easy to read. I think even a person who does not ride would enjoy the reading. Dan Sumerel has a knowledge of horses . He has a solution for problem horses. He writes in a manner that is easy to read. Dan writes with warmth , compassion and intelligence. I used to ride and work with horses. Dan stirred up the urges to ride and be a part of the horse world again. I would love to attend one of his seminars. He appreciates nature and has a love for his fellow man. He comes across as a down to earth person who does not present""airs.""He is able to bring his memories alive with humor and zest.!"
5,Toaster,Absolutely love this toaster. Best I ever had. I have a toaster oven but it takes too long for it to make toast. On this one I can put all sizes and types of bread. The best feature is the refresh button in case you forgot you had toast in there. Great product!
2,dud,"What a dud! I like the design because it makes it easier to handle since it sits under my upper cabinets.It looks nice too; however, it doesn't work. The breead/toast won't stay down. I have to hold it down to toast and I have better things to do with my time. The temperature settings aren't consistent. One time a setting of 2 won't brown the bread, the next time it burns it. JUNK!!"
1,Waffle button causes FIRE,"I have, wait - had, an older model of this toaster. This morning I tried the ""waffle"" button for the first time. Went upstairs, came down 3 minutes later and there were flames coming out of my toaster. Apparently the manufacturer incorporated a special ""self destruct"" feature under the code name ""waffle."" My advise, if you're smart you'll drop-kick this thing into the trash barrel."
2,RIP Tfal toaster,"great toaster (4.5 stars) until it just suddenly died. it wasn't a slow, progressive illness - it just died after only one year! i have had a streak of bad luck with toasters. i think i need to give up on the idea that a manufacturer can make a solid, long-lived toaster that actually toasts well, like the one my parents got as a wedding gift in 1960. they still use that old hunk."
1,Worst Toaster I have Ever Owned,"This is the worst toaster I have ever owned in 69 yrs. and I have had quite a few. It does not toast both sides of the bread evenly no matter what setting. You have to turn the slice while you stand there and watch it! The size of the slots are too short for many of today's breads. Often times the bread needs to be pushed down after starting the toaster. The crumb tray is a joke. The stainless steel is hard to keep clean. It is so poorly constructed you can see the heating elements through cracks that also allow a lot of the heat to escape. However, it does defrost on the defrost setting & the heating element is very hot and red unlike other toasters. It does ok on bagels. Odd shape makes finding a cover impossible & takes up a lot of counter space. Same design shape available at Target in a different brand at 1/2 the price."
3,Short Slots/Long Toast,"The Avante looks good and toasts well generally. Two problems: (1) We use one of Pepperidege Farms high fiber breads. They are about an inch longer than most commercial breads; therefore, the extra inch doesn't get toasted. Also, the bread won't fit in sideways. I even tried cutting the toasting time in half, pulling out and reversing the toast, then toasting for the last half of the time. No good. The toast burned in the center. (2) I can't seem to find the right temperature for English muffins to toast evenly."
1,im insecure,"jr. high i hope isnt going to get that way. im nervous now cuz""gawd"" i sure hope no one acts that way. i think that these girls hve no life at home and are probably jealous of everyone else in the school. plus what thirteen year old wears loui vitton and gucci. god lisi get alife"
4,Renvenge of the wannabes,"Well I didn't like this book so I going tell you what happen in this book. In this book there were 5 girls in it. There names was Massie Block, Claire Lyons, Kristen Gregory, Dylan Marvel, and Alicia Rivera, they're all friends. Massie and Kristen were the closest friends out of the whole group. But one day at a party they got in a huge fight. Massie stole Kristen's boyfriend away from her. They haven't talked for a whole week.My connection to this part is when Massie and Kristen were at a party and they were having so much fun, but when Massie was too hyper she was kissing Kristen's boyfriend in the bathroom. That part gave me a connection when my friend and I were at a party, and we were having so much fun she got way to hyper, and I saw her kissing my boyfriend in the bathroom. I got really sad and ran home as fast as I could. I ripped up every picture I had of my boyfriend and me together."
5,OMG THIS IS THE BEST!!!!,"OK I got the first one at a school bookfair and I read it so I got the 2nd one then I got the 3rd and out of the 3 I liked the 3rd the best and I would JUST LOVE TO MEET THESE people is they were real! This one is about Alicia and how she was getting sick and tired of being the ""beta"". Well see it is not all her fault she got talked into it! I really loved this book and I have read it about a million times and as soon as the 4th one comes out I am going out to get it ASAP!"
3,Good series so far but sometimes so annoying...,"Okay so far I love this series but of the characters lines are annoying like the constant saying of ""Ehmigawd"" or however they spell it and Massie's lame lines (i.e.Am I a barbeque, then why are up in my grill?) And that other girl's lame riddles. I also hate how no one will stand up to Massie, that's why I like the next book in this series since Alicia's cousin did at least stand up to her. At my old school, Massie and her clones would have been shoved into lockers, but this is just pure entertainment and it serves its purpose. I really loved Alicia in this book and she has become my favorite character."
5,REVENGE,It was good. I got totally hooked after the 1st couple chapters. The book is very well written. It goes more into the life of Alica and how Claire becomes a memeber of the clique. Cant wait for book 4.
5,OMG this is the best one yet!,"ok so you all no about the whole uniforn thing...yea that stirs up a lot of trouble and alica and massie become the BIGGEST enemies...and kristen, dylan, and claire go back and forth between massie and alicia...at the end they all become best friends again..but theres a sad twist at the end...but something tells me that in the next book it will all be okay..well i hope..this book deffinately has the most excitment, and drama. i give a double thumbs up!! u gotta read this one!"
3,Loved it,Great book loved it great for teen girls not too long either took me maybe a week only so good
5,Another great book By: Lisi Harrison,Revenge of the WannabesBy: lisi HarrisonThis book was a realistic fiction book because this book has to deal with real life but not the entire story is true. In the story a group of popular girls that go to Octavian Country Day School also known as OCD. They have a problem when Alicia Rivera and Olivia Ryan cheat on the uniform contest and they get to go to Teen People for a front cover story for the Christmas edition.I personally liked this book a lot because it relates to girls the age of 12-13. And it tells what happend to close friends if somebody gets in between them. I think you should read this book if you are 11 or older just so you can relate to what is happening and to understand the book.If you read this book you won't regret it at all!
1,un relistic,"i dont usually read these types of books and the reason why is because every part of them is untrue no school is like this no matter where u live this book gives girls who read it the wrong idea it tells them "" where cool clothing and expensive stuff and u will be popular "" but that is not true books should be telling kids to do what they think is right think for themselves and have their own personality also kids should not think that they should have every thing they could ever want at their finger tips because that is wrong they should work for what they want they dont need makeup to be pretty and they most deffenitly do not need boyfreinds!please excuese my spelling i am in a rush"
2,Horrible,"This book was basically a piece of trash. Unlikeable characters, superficial plots, the whole works. I'm not even sure why I continued to read these books. If you like hollow superficial characters who whine about how unpopular they are or how they're favorite Gucci bag isn't in stock and if you enjoy reading all about designer items then this book is for you. I'll admit the second book has a cliff hanger which is why I read the third but these girls are mean and they never learn. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars is because I think I'd be a total hypocrite if I only gave it one star because I bought the books. Like Gossip Girl and the A-List (which, I'll admit, I have not read) these books seem to be following a trend in superficialness. I enjoyed reading the details, but can you really base a whole book on details? I don't think so. If you really want to read something like this, go ahead, I'd be a hypocrite if I told you I didn't."
1,ECH!,"HOly crap, this book, this entire SERIES is the worst one I have ever read. The characters are all extremely shallow, with no real ""personality."" The topics the book covers are pointless and stupid."
5,They keep getting better,This book will keep you asking for more with a supenseful ending that you can't ignore. It's full of teenage drama that every teen can relate to. All my friends and I have read this book and love it. I can't wait to read the 4th which just came out. You will love this book.
3,the clique is just not clicking,"Alicia has had it with Massie. She is sick of always having to be 2nd. She decides to break out and start her own click. After all, no one should be ""in"" for such a long time, right? Meanwhile, Massie, Kristen, Dylan, and Claire (the newest member of the clique at last)are furious at Alicia for cheating on the fashion design contest. Alicia thinks she's got it going on, but she forgot how powerful Massie is. After she is formally ostracized from the Clique, its a battle between the ""wannabes"" and the Clique. Alicia recruits Olivia (Faux), and a group of look alikes to be in her group. Massie manages to crash Alicia's modeling shoot. Meanwhile, Massie still likes Cam- will she manage to break Claire and him up? When Alicia deviously manages to turn everyone against Massie, will it be the end of the Clique forever?"
1,Revenge of the Wannabes,"Young girls should not be exposed to such trash. I don't know what this author is thinking except that maybe she can make money by feeding into the ugly side of popularity... Genuine girls, Stay away.. This book is not for you!"
5,wow!! Revenge of the Wannabes is one of my fav books!!,"Ok, Revenge of the Wannbes is all about five girls going to Octavian Country School. Four of them (now five, since Claire is included now!!) are in a close clique, and they're mean to many of the other students. One girl in the clique, Alicia, is fed up with Massie (the leader) and decides that she wants to defy her. Massie is horrified!!Meanwhile, Claire and Cam are having some relationship problems, since Massie is always butting in.Wanna read some more? You'd better read the book to find out!FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--Livi"
5,The Revenge of the Wannabes,"I was very impressed with the third additition to the Clique series. The plot thickens as Alicia tries to break away from Massie's group and tries to form her own. She even goes to such lengths as to add members that look similar to her former friends. Kristen and Dylan are torn between the two groups just as Claire enters the scene as part of Massies's clique. Secrets are unvealed, gossip circulates, and Massie is determined that she will not be defeated by Alicia. This book is written at a different perspective than the previous books and mostly focuses on Alicia. I would definently recommend this book to all readers!"
4,Revenge of the Wannabee's,"In this book,The Clique is back and it's nastier than ever. Alicia Rivera, spoiled princess and definetley the prettiest of The Clique decides, with help from her new friend Olivia (or Faux-livia) that she is tired of being Massie Block's #2, she decides to step out on her own. Massie gets wind of this and plans her revenge. Kristen is suddenly wanted by both Alicia and Massie, doesn't know who to pick. Dylan knows that what Massie is doing to Alicia is bad, but she doesn't care. The newest member of The Clique, Claire Lyons, is suddenly wanted. Massie replaces Alicia with Claire and Cam, from the local boy's school Briarwood Academy, is showering Claire with mix CD's and gummy candy.Revenge of the Wannabee's definetley shows what happens when you decide to break out from your friends."
3,My first Camp novel - not so much romance as suspense,"As I said above, this is my first novel by Candace Camp. Having read wuch wonderful reviews on here I thought I would pick it up. It is a nice novel...I did like the main characters very much and it was unique. In general I tend to like novels with more dialogue than this, but Candace Camp writes so well and I barely noticed!My one real issue with the novel is that there is much more suspense, in my opinion, than romance. The following may be a spoiler for some but in a novel that is just over 400 pages, the actual ""encounter"" did not occur until after page 375. Like I said, it was a good read, but nothing out of the ordinary. I do think I will read some of her previous works beacuse it appears that authors usually move towards suspense from romance, so some earlier works are probably a little bit mroe romantic. Authors I like are Gaelen Foley, Lisa Kleypas, Judith McNaught and Iris Johansen."
1,Not Good....,"Reed was nice looking and all that but he had no spine.There wasn't a whole lot of substance to this book, and I really dislike it when the hero & heroine are almost contantly at odds."
2,Not as good as some of her other books,I was sadly disappointed in this novel from Candace Camp. There was no sexual chemistry between the hero and heroine and it was pretty easy to tell early on who the villain was. ** of out ***** from this reader.
2,"ok read, just not up to the previous books in this series","Being a big fan of Candace Camp I was a bit disappointed in this novel following along with Reed of the ""mad"" Morelands. I believe Anna's character was a bit too forceful and yet on the complete opposite was Reed's character. While male 'feelings' are applausible, his heart on the sleeve and begging left me thinking what a wimp. I would have like the hero if he didn't grovel so much for any affection from Anna, did he have no pride? The story itself was interesting and given society's views on mental illness, believable. Looking forward to the next Moreland's story."
1,Couldn't finish,I have read a few of Candace Camps novels and have never not finished one. There is a first time for everything! I just couldn't get into the storyline. I put it down within the first 100 pages.
5,Yoga Solitaire,"This game is fun to play in a group, but I love using it for my own practice. The lovely design, the chakra colors, the charming and useful drawings inspire to begin. I like the surprise of turning over a card from each level and following it. I use the cards as stepping stones to a better life for a better me."
2,Not David T. Chastain,"This recording is not by David T. Chastain from the band Chastain, CJSS, Zanister, etc. This is from another person with the same name."
5,Best speakerphone I have found,"I work from home quite often and have been searching for a speakerphone so that I can participate in conference calls from my home office and have it not be like I was calling from another planet. Most of the less expensive speakerphones I tried either I could barely make out what was being said on the call, or when the mic wasn't muted, the audio would cut in and out. This phone is expensive, but I feel to me it was worth it. Audio quality is great, and I can easily hear what is going on on the conference call."
5,Excellent Teleconferencing Phone,"I use the Soundstation2 for my home office, often teleconferencing for up to 8 hours per day for my work with NASA. The sound quality on this device is amazing with consistent volume control. Even on teleconferences with very weak connections on the other end of the conversation, I am usually able to discern what people are saying . There is no embarrassing echo with this device. I've been using this for two years straight and could not be happier. I swallowed hard at the initial price of this device, however, experience shows that this is one of the smartest investments that I have made. If you spend a lot of time on teleconferences and have a private office, I highly recommend the Soundstation2 as an option for your office."
2,Typical Speaker Phone Echo,"Purchased this item for use in home office. There is no static, but still has that echo of a speaker phone. I am disappointed because the system is very expensive. Perhaps you don't get what you pay for."
3,"Good map, some some info is wrong","I LOVED the pull out map with places to visit on it. However, two of the restaurants we tried to visit weren't there anymore- and one of them hadn't been open ""in years"", according to a local. Fodor's Toronto was better."
4,Much needed for students of Baptists in America,"P.H. Mell dominated the early years of the Southern Baptist Convention. While not relating anything new or unique, these sermons do demonstrate the theology of early Southern Baptists quite well."
5,Great products better value!!!,"We had a hard time waiting for this to get to us. The tin has Durex on the top but it doesn't pop right out at you so you can leave it on the night stand. We love the vibrating rings, and they can be turned off if you want to use just a short time(who really wants to do that thought). you get 4 of 12 differnt kinds of condoms 4 flavored varities: strawberry, mint, banana, and chocolate(pretty good). Then there are studded, ribbed, her pleasure, low smell of latex, something like extended pleasure, regular, can't remember the other two types. So much fun to just grab one you never know what you are gonna get. LOVE IT!!!"
4,Nice Combo,"Nice variety, great value. My partner says they fit better then the what he was using previously."
5,Great Deal For Great Product!!,"Just got these today and everything looks to be perfect. There are 48 condoms and the 3 vibrating rings as described. I have yet to use them, but Durex has never failed me in the past.Here is the distribution of flavors/types and what each one does.6 Performax (Grey Wrapper) - Control Climax to Last Longer6 Natural Feeling (Blue Wrapper) - Natural Feel w/ Water Lubricant6 Love (Light Blue Wrapper) - Thinner, Longer, Wider, More Lube6 Rainbow Colors (Rainbow Wrapper) - Colors, Lube6 Enhanced Pleasure (Turquoise Wrapper) - Different Shape, Unique Fit6 Pleasuremax (Pink Wrapper) - Ribs + Dots6 Intense Sensations (Orange Wrapper) - Many Raised Studs for Pleasure2 Flavored Banana (Yellow Wrapper) - Flavored Banana2 Flavored Apple (Light Green Wrapper) - Flavored Apple2 Flavored Strawberry (Red Wrapper) - Flavored Strawberry"
4,Nice variety for the money ...,This pack has a good amount and variety of products for the low price tag. Plus the tin is a cool addition. The vibrating rings are great. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a good variety pack.
2,Don't like it,The condoms are not that great as they are not as good as trojans ones. Hope they can improve them by giving them more moisture.
4,a lot of condoms,"for a married man with kids this is more condoms than I may ever go through, but all in all condoms are crap but you got to use them so that we don't get anymore kids."
1,"Worst condoms ever, very thick and no feeling whatever!!","I though that buying a pack of condoms will save me money, but I was mistaken. This is the worst condoms ever, very thick and you hardly feel anything, it is like wearing a metal jacket over your penis. I am very disappointed. Just don't waste your money.."
4,"Nice gift, writing an essay on my own dad","Though the celebrity names help sell this book, the essays are edited well, and I appreciated that not all the stories are of ""perfect dads."" Giving it for father's day to my dad and my husband who is about to be a dad, and writing an extra chapter of my own to include about each of them (will project what kind of dad my husband will be...)"
4,Great gift idea.,"I bought this book for my father. It is a fast and simple read. Three reasons why I bought the book: (1) it is compilation of short stories written by different celebrities that offer unique perspectives on fatherhood, (2) a number of stories are well-written (some are much better than others). I particularly liked the ones that focused on one event and/or used humor; (3) the proceeds go to charity (which is a must for me when it comes to books written by a celebrity.)"
3,WOW,"I have to tell you, if you have a hard time getting to sleep, this will for sure help you. Within minutes of taking it my eyes and face musles felt heavy... I previously had a hard time falling to sleep... I think this pill is better for people who need help STAYING asleep. I watched 3/4 of a movie after taking one pill, which sounds bad, but it may be good considering i probably could have watched 2 whole movies otherwise, but I will never know. what I do know is, I will NOT be taking these pills again. I sleep for 10 hours and still feel like I can fall asleep standing up. They say on the box you wake up feeling refreshed, this is NOT the case. You will feel soooo comforatable and heavy in your bed that getting up is the last thing you will want to do. This pill works perfectly if you dont have a family or a job, or any responsibilities at all throughout your day, otherwise do NOT take it. It will ruin your entire day."
3,its just ok,Ive tried sleepinal for a couple weeks now and it makes you mildly sleepy but not quite enough to really get you there. Unisom soft gels are way better. Everybodys different so go ahead and try them. They just didnt do the trick for me.
3,Does not fit well,"If you put it into the case that it's intended for it does not fit well, foam is a little too big, and if you remove the rubber ""seal"" then you have a unsealed pelican case, worthless to me. It works, let's just put it that way and takes up unneeded space if that's what you're getting it for"
4,great gift for the texan lady in your life,"This quotation anthology is well-organized and easy to follow. it makes a great gift for a ""Lone Star Lady,"" or a reference for any public speaking/writing efforts.The authors of all the quotes are Texan women, and the quotes are organized into subject matter. This makes for easy referencing!I have a copy for myself, and gave one to my mother!"
1,texas book reader,"This was one of the dullest books that I have ever read. There are no interesting or juicy quotes in the entire book. I really wanted to like the book, because I met the authors in Austin and they were nice ladies. They chose the most politically correct,Amercan flag and apple pie, dull quotes that I have ever read. Typical boring stuff put out by the owner of the publishing company Dromgoole. The publisher likes short books where the reader does not need to think. Books about puppy dogs, kittens,Tex-Mex chile recipes and how wonderful it was growing up in the 1950s under segregation in south Texas.Believe me segregation was not the good old days. I give as an example of a stupid quote ""War is not nice,"" said Barbara bush."
4,This is a good upbeat pop-rock CD.,"I saw the Red Telephone as an opening band for Harvey Danger at a recent concert. I tried to order the CD from my local music store, but I have waited close to a year. So, I do not own the CD yet, but I still remember how good the band was. The band is rather Sloanish, but with more guitar. They are also very hot!! They sounded like an Americanized Canadian pop band. (more guitar and stuff). Its just fun stuf!"
4,Great song,This album has one very unigue sounding song. Big fran's baby is great if you like bagpipes.
3,mediocre controller,"Most universal remotes have codes you can enter that will automatically configure your remote to work with your device. This remote suggests that you program each button individually. While very time-consuming, the product works great. If you don't have the extra few minutes to spend, go with one of the better brands."
2,Painful Remote,"This remote is hardly worth the money. I am very disappointed. The IR sensor is very weak. I had to point it exactly at the xbox (unlike the wireless controller); it wont even go through my glass coffee table. There might as well be a scope mounted on to the darn thing to align it. The fact that you have to switch between ""learned mode"" and 360 controls is ridiculous.My main concern is how unresponsive the remote is. I was used to skipping the commercials with the 360 controller by pushing the trigger several times for a big skip, but with this remote, you have to press, then wait, press, then wait, and so on. Very inconvenient, especially when you have have direct line of sight. My arm got tired of holding the remote up on the air while feeding one command at a time. Do not buy this item, its disappointing."
1,Junk,"The placement of buttons is horrible and the ""universal"" and ""learning"" aspects are some sort of sick joke. You WILL NOT be able to control a second device. In addition, after a few weeks, various shorts developed so that I would constantly have to remove the batteries."
2,"Not Bad, Not Great","This provides a decent overview of bulk candy machine business. It does NOT cover any other type of vending business. Furthermore, this book was written the mid-to-late 80s and some material is out of date."
2,Superficial coverage of bulk (loose) candy vending.,"This book covers only the bulk (loose) candy and nut vending business, and in the most superficial manner. What is there, however, is good. The best book I've seen on the subject is ""Vending Success Secrets-How Anyone Can Grow Rich In America's Best Cash Business,"" by Bill Way"
3,The Road Less Traveled,"This McCarthy novel about Appalachian poor white folk who say I reckon alot (I kept thinking of Billy Joe Thornton in Sling Blade) is a precursor to his fabulous bizarre travel book, The Road. Lots of action, lots of incomprehensible happenings, with many dark twisted characters, this book keeps one reading until the inconclusive climax."
3,Not up to the hype!,"This was my first book by McCarthy and after reading so many rave reviews I anticipated being blown off my feet by this book. I almost feel as if it's sacreligious to not go on and on about the author's brilliance here. Now, I did LIKE the book, and the story was compelling. The dialogue helped paint a vivid picture of the time and place. But on the other hand, the story had some major chronological holes where you get to a new section and you're like, ""Wait what happened to...?"" The language is very rich, which at times was well-done but at others it just got distracting and I kept thinking, ""Put the thesaurus down and step away slowly!"" Will I read another book by this author? Yes, absolutely. But I'm far from sold about him being a five star writer so far."
2,New to Cormac McCarthy,"McCarthy's writing is mesmerizing. This is my first McCarthy book, and I am hoping that the feel of his other books is the same, but with better character development than Outer Dark. I found this book to be dark (no surprise) but the darkness was without merit. It was senseless confusion, gore and some of the characters were laughable in their supposedly meaningful insights. Many incidents in the book appeared without explanation. None the less, this book affected me and I am looking forward to reading more from this talented writer"
1,Peter Smith hardcover WARNING!,"If you're considering buying the Peter Smith ""edition"" of this book, note that it is NOT a new ""edition"" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, not for sale to the general public. Amazon haven't seen fit to warn you of this, alas. The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time."
3,Dark,"As with most of his books, McCarthy again writes a story that is engrossing, darkly amusing and hopeless for the participants."
4,"Dark, Darker, Darkest","This is a beautifully written, almost poetic, book. I was reminded of the King James Bible, which has ""and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" Still, I struggled to finish it because it's just so damn depressing. The characters drift through the story like lost souls in hell. The story reminds me of the book of Job, but without the happy ending. Comparisons to ""The Road"" are obvious. This book is just as dark, but in ""The Road,"" I felt the father's love for his son and his determination to keep him alive in spite of the hopelessness of their situation. In ""Outer Dark"" I just did not care. For unique use of English this book deserves 5+ stars--I appreciated its artistry, but couldn't enjoy it."
4,"Got it, love it.","Great songs from 2nd Chapter! Arrangements are not very difficult, and with a little practice, an intermediate pianist can easily play these. Book has 24 songs, including ""Mansion Builder"", ""Well, Haven't You Heard?"", ""Starlight, Starbright"", and ""Daydreamer"". As a teen in the '70s, I loved their music and attended their concerts. Now my own kids enjoy their music so much, I'm buying another book for them (mine's worn out!)."
1,Jagged circles,"This item creates circles that have an uneven, jagged edge. I'd say the cutting metal inside is made poorly and this creates a pretty heinous circle. A waste of money."
4,Not bad at all,The roto system is a inexpensive accessory for your rig. The rotary system gives various positions of holster on your Molle system (vest or battle belt).
3,marcos whitt songs,I didnt get what was in tbe website. On this offer reads dvd...not cd..to my understanding dvd is a movie or a type of video. I ordered dvd and i got a cd.the company that sent me the merchandise agreed on sending me dvd...never got it. Amazon should contact them for misleading customers. Thanks
2,A light snack,"A fast food book. Actually I read this book just because I get bored, and I want I light snack. And that's what I get. A light snack.The story is about a hit man, ex IRA enforcer, Sean Dillon. After disassociating with IRA, he became a hired gun, for anyone who can afford him. The background of the story is the First Gulf War, during Bush Senior administration. He was hire by Saddam Hussein regime to make a big hit, big enough to startle the West.The story is quick-paced, you can read it without straining your brain or memory too much. But in some places, it is becoming too repetitive, sacrificing the thrilling effect for a supposed-thriller book.And what really bothered me is the ending. It is anti-climax. It costs the book at least one-star in my review. It makes you say, ""So after 300-pages of reading, just like that?""Verdict: 2/5. I might from time to time try to read Jack Higgins again, when I get bored. Maybe I will try his other series, such asThe Eagle Has Landed."
3,"Not His Best, but Good","Eye of the Storm is an exciting action thriller that follows a plot by Saddam Hussein to assassinate somebody, anybody, in the Allied Command to show that he can extend his power when needed. Ultimately, the mission falls to IRA member Sean Dillon who makes an attempt on one British PM and decides to settle on another. This is not my favorite Higgins, it moves a little slow compared to his other stuff, but the story is good and the characterss compelling."
5,Move over James Bond....Here comes Sean Dillion!,"Higgins delivers in this whirlwind action-packed thriller. Former IRA enforcer Sean Dillon is about to demolish the whole British War Cabinet. Things don't go as planned, and Dillon is left to make a most daring escape. The charming, witty, bad boy that you can't help but to adore, Sean Dillon, doesn't fret. He performs best under pressure. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger that will keep you turning the pages. The pace is swift, the twisting plot is believable, and the ending is a slam dunk!"
5,The best of the Dillon books,"In this book, former IRA terrorist turned freelance assassin Sean Dillon attempts to assassinate former PM Maggie Thatcher, then the entire British War Cabinet, all at the behest of a former KGB colonel and an Iraqi-French oil millionaire. British intelligence operatives and two of Dillon's former IRA colleagues are tasked with stopping him.Dillon is at his best as the charming yet cold-blooded rogue who operates according to his own set of (somewhat twisted) standards. The short appearance by veteran IRA man turned professor Liam Devlin is a welcome addition. The character of Martin Brosnan is not as clear as he could have been. I haven't read any other Higgins books involving him (though I'd very much like to,) so I'm not sure if this is a general problem with the character or just this book's incarnation of him.All in all, a great introduction to a great character whom you wind up rooting for in spite of yourself."
3,Eye of the Storm,"Based, in part, on the 1980's attempted mortar attack on PM Margaret Thatcher's life, Higgins spins a story well worth reading. Our favorite characters are all present and accounted for, although you will be at a loss to determine what their individual roles are in this novel. Dillon comes off as a bad guy, hired by Saddam Huessein and the French to take out the PM and he almost succeeds.The story is fast moving, holds your attention, and somehow allows you to draw a fresh breath between incident. The master story teller has done it again using a minimum of words but a maximum of chilling occurrences which keep you on your toes.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
3,Its ok if its what you are looking for,This is an older book but the information is relevant if you are looking to raise turkeys in a commercial manner.What this book is not is helpful for is a more free range approach. For that you will probably need to look earlier or more recently.This book focuses on production turkeys and not heritage type breeds or less intensive types of management.
5,The true Princess Royal,"I was lucky to go to the preauction showing of her gowns with my professor. This woman epitomizes what a 20th Century princess and Princess Royal should be. She is the true Once and Future Queen of England and Charles should be truly ashamed of himself and his selfish, immature behavior."
4,Good Book,"I really like Eric Carle books. The kids really enjoy them and that is the most important thing. They did a good job in making it into a paperback also, it is pretty durable."
5,It's a cute book!,"My 4 years old son was expecting have some funny experience with this book, but.. it was more of that... My son is really happy with this wonderfull book... The animation, of course, the best that I've even seen in my life. My children at the school /I'm a teacher in a preschool, were really quiet and surprised looking the pictures.. I recommended this book inclusive to the parents... Its woonderfull!!!"
5,Fun Story with a Message,I think this is a fun story with a good message at the end. It's funny to see the creature the chameleon winds up being toward the end - before he decides to be himself. I'd put this on the list of recommended Carle books.
4,An Inspiration,"Cynthia Yates is an inspiration for anyone that wants (or needs) to tighten their belts without feeling completely deprived. Her upbeat attitude and sense of humor make this a fun read. Her tips range from grocery shopping and cooking tips to gift giving to entertaining to big ticket items to maintaining things we already own, and more. This book has many good ideas that are easy to implement. Ms. Yates makes you stop and think how a lot of things we think of as necessary can be either done without or obtained in a more intelligent way. Nothing fancy here-just common sense and a well thought out approach to making it in a tight economy, especially helpful if you are new at scaling down. She is a Christian author who is quick to tell her readers that God comes first in her life, however her ideas work well for anyone who sees a need to get a grip on their spending. To fully benefit from this book be prepared to ""roll up your sleeves."""
4,Lets make some fun of mech Anime's,after I watch the first episode I feel in love with it! they did a tastful job of making fun of most mech anime's. With it's light hearted view I'm sure it will be one that you will watch again and again
3,some hits and misses,"How do I put this...there are some really good episodes, and scenes in Dual that make watching this well worth the time and money...the comedy, the romantic momments...kinda like Tenchi Muyo and Ranma...but but but there are also really disappointing and confusing ""what the heck is going on"" episode(s) (almost like the last 2 awful episodes of Evangelion)...and that really messes up the whole series...so I don't know if it's really worth getting the whole DVD set...that's a question mark right there...so I'd rather get something else in the mean time, there are a lot better anime series out there (like Kenshin and Escaflowne) to get in the mean time..."
3,Guy Maddin's masterpiece.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Brand Upon the Brain! is what I would consider an experimental film direcred by Guy Maddin. The film has no dialogue but only a voice over. The DVD has the voice overs by multiple people each narrating the whole film. It also includes a soundtrack by foley artists.The plot is about a man who lives with has family and a group of orphans on the grounds of a lighthouse. Other than that it can be confusing to followThe DVD has some special features which are also nice. It has two new short films by Guy Maddin ""It's My Mother's Birthday Today"" and ""Footsteps"" both exclusively on this DVD release. Also is a documentary ""97 Percent True"" about the film's production, a deleted scene, and voice over narrations by Isabella Rossellini, Laurie Anderson, John Ashbery, Guy Maddin, Louis Negin, Crispin Glover, and Eli Wallach.This is an unsusal film but worth checking out."
2,OU,"A great great football story, but disappointingly written. For starters, Jim Dent misses his audience. Recreated quotes reminisce made-for-grade school stories, yet hollow and stereotypical characters go on big-time drinking binges and grow 'harder than Chinese arithmetic' over the ladies. More disappointing is that one must read between the lines to discover what's most fascinating about 1940s/50s-era football - that the national champion was chosen BEFORE the bowl games (imagine THAT before BCS), that players played on both sides of the ball, that there were no designated field goal kickers, and heaps of other subtleties that have faded away as college football has 'grown.' Perhaps there was a rush to get this out while the 2000 Sooners team was STILL undefeated and national champions. It takes time to make a winner, I guess."
5,Wonderful Book,"I am not a fan of scrappy quilts but couldn't resist this book when I saw the beautiful color combinations inside. I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in using up all those small pieces of fabric that you know we all have. :-))) Her system is easy enough for beginners and inspirational enough for those of us who have been around the ""block"" a time or two. Enjoy!"
3,good selection,I am not a beginner quilter. I came by this book for ideas and a new selection of blocks. There are easy to read instructions and pictures to aid in your placement of pieces. I have choosen blocks for our quilt guild to use for Block of the Month. I have enjoyed it and am now purchasing another copy for my mother.
5,Definitive Guide to Warhol,"Prints, proofs, paintings -- everything is here, plus essays that explicate and set context."
5,This is one of Basie's greatest!,"This CD features the whole Basie band in exciting ensemble work. Whirly Bird is amazing, same with One O'Clock Jump, Splanky, and Jumpin' at the Woodside."
5,"""Opener"" for Sinatra at the Sands","If you're a Basie fan, this CD is a ""must have."" It contains the music of the Count Basie big band recorded live at Sands Hotel in 1966, when the band ""opened"" for Frank Sinatra and then backed him up at this historic show. For a 1966, live recording, the quality and fidelity are amazing -- some minor imbalances here and there, but still great. The band sounds fantastic; and you'll want to get the CD ""Sinatra at the Sands"" (with the Basie band backing him up) to complete this unofficial 2-CD ""set."""
2,From a teacher,"Not quite what I expected, but it is ok. Talks about journal writing, writing narratives about other people and about literature, writing stories, and composition skills (verbs, nouns, transitions, ett.) It is very brief, and doesn't really present any new ideas."
2,"Not a text for Professionals, too shallow and dated","I concurr with the previous 1-star review - I was expecting serious technical insights on the important (forward-looking) issue of WiFi/WiMAX Fixed-Mobile-Convergence. Instead, even though this text is dated 2005, it portrays 802.20 in the same light as 802.16, even though 802.20 is nearly irrelevant.I would put this book in the same league as the paperback series from ""Sams"" and other survey texts costing around $50..........Fairly useful, but hardly worth $99.00, and certainly not published in a ""Professional Engineering"" series.I gave it 2 stars for clear and concise presentation, if you are in technical marketing or sales, this would be an excellent book."
1,Not good,"This book is not worth the price. I read the first 2 chapters and only skimmed the rest before deciding to return it. Even though it's a recent book, it covers in part technology that's 20 years old, so the title is misleading. On the new technology, it only skims the surface, not really going into details as any book on 802.x would for half the price. As far as how 802.x and 3G cellular networks and devices (UMTS, IMS) are going to co-exist and converge, it's silent. A real disapointment"
5,GREAT DEAL,What a great deal on such a great product. DREFT doesn't usually offer many deals or coupons - so scoop them up when you can!
5,All of the Dot-to-Dot books that I ordered,I am very pleased with all the dot-to-dot books that I ordered and will continue to use your website for ordering.
1,confused,What is advertised is not received 3x. Complex puzzles are shown but 3rd grader puzzles are received.The same book was sent over and over?? I am not sure why this keeps happening.
5,Terrific fun!,"I heartily recommend THE GREATEST DOT TO DOT BOOK IN THE WORLD series! The puzzles are challenging and very enjoyable. I'm a 66 year old grandmother and my husband and I enjoy doing the puzzles together and we recommend these well-produced books to people of all ages and abilities. Thanks for the fun, Mr. Kalvitis!Sincerely,Patsy Koehn"
1,Junk,How much would you pay for junk? $1.99 that's how much. Broke the third day. The one I bought at the local retailer lasted a good year and a half.
4,Fun Book,"This book is fairly accurate in its search to fit people into behavioral categories. The truth is that there will never be enough categories to create exact behavioral matches but this is a really fun book to read and helps you to understand how to better deal with certain ""colors"" or types of personalities that may rub you the wrong way. It also helps you to be aware of your own traits, strengths, and weaknesses. The book was designed so that you can skip around to whatever chapter entices you and it will remain understandable and readable. I read it every few years just to see if I have changed any. Enjoyable and fun."
5,The color code helps you to understand each personality.,"The color code is one step of helping you to deal with each person. It helps you to understand why people act they way they do, and why they do it. I have used this book and Taylor's second book, ""The Character Code"", in business, and in my homelife to understand my counterparts. Life is easy if you have a set of rules to follow, the color code helps you to see the rules, understand the rules, and how to WORK those who don't care about the rules. I have a much better appericiation of the HUMAN mind and those who work, live and come in contact with me. I have read and listen to all of Taylor's books and tapes and consider it the best investment to my personal well being. Thanks Taylor for your YELLOW personality and making the books so enjoyable..........."
5,This book will help your management team work!,"Taylor Hartman and his color code theory has worked wonders with my management team. It makes communications with peers, staff and the outside world much easier. I recommend the book without reservation. Taylor is a wonder at management retreats."
4,Great,"Product was great, purchased new, and arrived in timeframe promised. A good read, the concept of the book is sound and provides food for thought when working with a new staff that has participated in the evaluation."
4,"4 or 2, Yellow or Blue","You get to figure it out. Warning!! I whipped out the audio to play in the car and oops you have to take the test first. Please do so. Then listen. Fascinating. I typed all my friends, co-workers, relatives. Not only did it help me to understand some of my motives for doing things, it helped me understand what exactly motivates other people and how they view information in totally different ways. My daughter claims they are using this tape in one of her communication courses at college."
2,Not as good as I thought.,"It wasn't easy to follow. I didn't keep my interest, I just flipped through and read what I wanted. Not so good."
1,Don't Trust This Man,"As a former client, I can honestly say that Taylor Hartman is arrogant, and unprofessional His office is unorganized, unprofessional, and his staff changes approximately every three to six months. While working with Taylor he continually blamed others for his mistakes and continually bad mouthed the people that worked for him. He treats those that sell his product with utmost disrepect and disdain and does not pay what he promises. He also does not honor his word or his money back guarantee. It is my opinion that a man who cannot run his own office should certainly not be teaching others to run theirs. I will never use Mr. Hatrman's product again."
1,Total BS,"I'm with ""Psychologist"" (Utah) and also ""Kailinn"" (Detroit). The examples he cites are never given names--not even fictitious ones; thus, there is very little ""human interest"" here. This is a really disappointing book. And only FOUR categories? I have not read the work of Stephen Covey, as Psychologist reommends, but I can definitely and strongly recommend ""The New Personality Self-Portrait"" by Oldham and Morris instead of this."
4,"Very accurate, helpful book","Being an almost pure White personality, I dislike being put in a category, ;) so I almost didn't finish the color test when a friend gave it to me. But after finishing, I had to buy the book to see what I could learn about myself and how to improve my relationships with others. Let me tell you from experience that everything Dr Hartman says about White personalities is true! I had never realized why I had trouble communicating, asserting myself, and making decisions, or why I have never felt any great personal ambition. It has also helped me understand my Red friend a lot better. I had to laugh when reading the Red/White section, because it perfectly describes our relationship! Now I know what to do better, and what not to do."
4,The People Code,"It was amazing to me how I could ""categorize"" people in my family and understand them alot better. I wish I had had this book years ago."
5,Learn to live life as it was meant to be !!,"I have learned so much from reading this book.It has helped me more than any of the other dozens of books that I have read.Life is much simpler for me because I have a clearer understanding of who I am,& I am now able to have healthier relationships with my family & friends.THANK YOU DR.HARTMAN !"
5,Excellent book.,I have read The Color Code and I must say that it has been positively life changing. To analyze relationships based on motive and not actions was a completely revolutionary way of thinking for me.I highly recommend this book. Very few books in life are really life altering but this one is. I have met and worked with Dr.Hartman and I must say this man lives what he teaches. He is a man of great integrity . To all who want to understand the people in their lives and grow to become a better person and partner I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Karen Rencher
5,Simply the farthest reaching principles for self help.,"I've known Dr. Hartman for over twelve years, and have seen the power and clarity that his thoughts and wisdom can envolk on people that are ready to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their lives and relationships. There is simply no other author or mentor that has put anything onto print that is so straight forward. His processes and methods have always been true for every situation that I have encountered. This book will cause a lifstyle change for the better, for the reader with clean motives."
2,"Outrageous, But a Bit Too Disgusting","This DVD suffers from poor production values and too much of a ""I made this last weekend because I was bored"" feel. Some of the scenes are funny, but others veer off into pointless misanthropic exploits. The scene with the magazine stand was funny until the guy decided to yell about sex acts involving feces...then I just felt dirty. How is it funny to verbally and physically abuse a retarded person? It's not, but that's what they do in one of the scenes. Hidden camera stunts should be about having fun with people, but too many of these scenes are just no fun."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","I ordered several of these and about a quarter of them showed up dead on arrival. The white ones aren't white, more like a dull orange, so they don't match the colored ones. Given the DOA ones, I worry about how long they will last. Disappointing for the price."
5,Soji Lantern Green,This little item has decorated my back yard for a year now. Very nice and recommend highly.
5,Irish Rock still rules,"""The Professor"" is Pat Mac Manus's nick name and this DVD proves what a virtuoso he truly is. Accompanied by his two brothers John & Tommy its balls to the floor music, soaking in a variety of musical styles from Irish trad to blues with modern day sounds. 20yrs on and this music still sounds fresh & original."
1,What a terrible guide!,"Arrived in Tokyo with this guidebook and quickly realized I would be better off without it. The printing I have (2001) is not only hard to read and follow, but there are multiple misprints and incorrect page references. The big selling point of the book is the ability to correlate hotels, restaurants, attractions and nightspots based on page references. Many of these were wrong. The references for Tokyo bay restaurants send you to the page with Ginza hotels! Spend more time seeing Tokyo and less time staring at this book. My copy is sitting in a trash can in Tokyo. I recommend any other guidebook!"
1,Interesting Title but Little More,"Coming on the heels of ""Icebreaker"" this ranks as a major disappointment from John Gardner. The plot and prose is a collection of disjointed and very uninspiring ideas for our hero James Bond. However, several of these ideas did seem to make it to the screen shortly after in some of Roger Moore's later Bond films and Timothy Dalton's first outing. ""Role of Honor"" ultimately has a rambling plot that leaves the reader totally disinterested. I was very disappointed with this novel."
3,oh my yes,"Role of Honor could have been better if there were less plot-holes and there was more frequent action. The biggest plot-hole is this: why is James Bond attacked in the streets? The attack is never explained, and I was waiting the whole book to find out why, but there was no answer. I felt let down. Another plot-hole is: Why does the villain turn up at the casino with Bond? Hmm. The action, which is infrequent, isn't very good. All there is is a training-camp sequence which is too flimsy to enjoy and a brief fight on a blimp."
4,Life,"Jewel is the devoted wife and mother. When the relationship with her husband Malcolm abruptly comes to an end, she becomes heartbroken and beating herself up wondering why Malcolm didn't love her anymore.Adjusting to being a divorced, single mom along comes Justin who wants to make her happy for the rest of her life.The Rest of Our Livesis a story that is recommended for everyone to read. It deals with love, broken heart, finding yourself, and tragedy. For me, Mrs. Connelly-Craig really hit home in different parts of the story. Its pretty lengthy but I enjoyed it all the same. The story will make you smile and will make you cry, all in all its a good read.TangerineReader's Paradise Book Club"
3,WTF!,"ok, i love my pride. but this one is kinda weak. if you are looking for an action packed dvd, look for another. this has 2 - 3 decent fights. half of them , the fighters fall down or quit because they hurt themselves.no really , half of them just give up. if you are a silva fan (like me) this dvd is cool.seriously, i have never seen so many strange things happen on a fight program. guys just falling over. people blowing out their knees or shoulders. giants getting cut down by blows that wouldnt knock out a middleweight.it seemed i was saying ""WTF WAS THAT??!!"" after every 2 fights."
5,"Never knew the original formula, love his one","I love it. I take it to work every day- physically strenuous job- and feel energized and nourished right away. Instead of drinking it as a smoothie or adding juice, I just add water, but I realize that this is not everyone's 'cup of tea'. I tried others, and did not like how sweet they were. Best of all the ones I've tried by far."
1,Beware of prior ratings,"The 17th edition was just released (5/2001), so beware of the prior reader reviews dated 1999 & 1998. The 15th & 16th editions were excellent books, and this (the 17th) should be just as good (although sadly, it will chronicle the delisting of many major combatant vessels that projected power during the Cold War), but until reviewers actually read or scan the book, these reviews are not authentic."
5,well written applied book,"Since the work of Nelder and Wedderburn in 1972 it has become computationally feasible to unify normal linear models, categorical models and survival models through the use of a link function in the generalized linear model construct. However implementation has only slowly come about but the techniques are now very popular. Today various software packages are available to implement the methods. It is also the subject of much current research particularly in the medical field. Lindsey provides a clear presentation with many recent applications. The required level of mathematics is intermediate to advanced. Some basic knowledge of statistical methods and inference is assumed.Another fine applied book with emphasis on computation through GENSTAT is ""Statistical Modelling using GENSTAT"" by McConway et al. ..."
4,"The onion soup is great here, but don't eat it before you have to sing, it's murder.","This concert was recorded during Frank Sinatra's tour of world capitals in 1962 to raise money for children's charities. Sinatra was accompanied by a six man band, which was one of the smallest groups he ever worked with. Of course, the smaller group necessitated simpler arrangements of the songs, but they still work pretty well. Sinatra is in good voice, but he seems to run out breath a few times. Could it have been something he ate? Anyway, this is an enjoyable concert of Sinatra singing some of his most popular songs. Frank's fans will enjoy it."
3,The sound guy(s) screwed this one up,It seems weird to give a Sinatra effort only three stars but the sound is so bad that it mars what is probably an excellent performance. There is a serious phase problem - it hard to tell if it just on the ambience mics or poorly placed band mics - it could even be a reverb chamber out of phase - whatever... but it makes this recording unlistenable for me. It is hard for me to believe they couldn't fix this with a remix. Proper phase is 101 in recording - what the hell happened?
3,Not sure about this one,"Wow. I was so looking forward to getting this from Amazon, which I did last week. I am going through another major Frank phase, where I have to have his music close at hand for comfort and joy. So I've recently picked up some Frank CDs that I did not yet have. When you think about it, they are a ridiculous value - about $15 tops for a great piece of musical art from our favorite singer that can enrich your life on a daily basis. Anyway, I usually don't like to review a CD such as this without playing it several times, but my initial reaction is that the sound is strangely flat, and Franks voice just does not sound as rich as normal, and actually strains and misses a few notes here and there. Now, sometimes one needs to acclimate to a new CD and give it a chance, and Frank certainly deserves that. I will be back to update this in a month or so. Three stars for now."
4,"Great song selection, but...","This is an excellent concert, but this CD is not in stereo! Purchase Sinatra At The Sands with Count Basie! It has way better sound quality than this one, folks!"
3,"another live performance - solid, but","it is ok, but I certainly prefer some of his earlier recordings - and certainly the studio albums not remastered over any live stuff"
5,life long Sinatra fan,"This is the only version of ""Nancy with the Laughing Face"" where "" Nancy"" HAS A SISTER.My name is Nancy, and I have listened to this song since I was 13 years old, and I am now 74.I have a sister, as does my Grand daughter, Nancy, so I purchased many of these cd's forfamily members."
4,Nice Concert,Live in Paris is a pretty good concert from Sinatra. It's been out for quite a long time and remember listening to it nearly 20 years ago when I was still in high school. Would say of all the older concerts available for Frank Sinatra that this one is the best quality and performance of any. Just as good as the ones released in the new york and vegas box sets. The sound quality is really good compared to many other releases out there.Peter J. Miller
5,mega bloks steam loco,"i recieved this mega bloks set from my fiancee for valentine's day(26 years old and still playing with toys lol).it took me about 4 hours to put together, but well worth it. It's a very nice model. If your really into trains this will go great in the train room (that's where mine is).This set is ideal for the collector, it has ALOT of detail.It's a very solid set also, nice and heavy. i'm sure the younger kids will like it to, its got big wheels so it will roll on the floor or carpet with ease...Hope this helps....Vaughn"
1,"Disappointed. ""Big Time""",Just a bad experience with this seller. Ordered the watch with a Blue Face. They shipped the black face watch. Still tried to set it up. The box included the directions for a different T Touch watch. I downloaded the correct instructions off the Tissot website. The watch time is supposed to be set at the factory. It was not and it turns out that the battery was dead. Shipping it back. So much for buying watches on Amazon.
5,German Fighter Me 210/410,"Before WW2, the Germans thought that twin engine planes would be excellent ""destroyers"" of enemy fighters. Fast, heavily armed the Me-110 led the way. The Battle of Britain showed the theory to be false, yet the Germans persisted in attempting to improve upon the Me-110.The follow on Me-210 was a disaster. It was unstable and difficult for even the test pilots to fly. The Me-410 fixed some of those problems, but these fighters were doomed before they ever took off.This In Action book gives a very good, concise history of the problems and testing. Plenty of line drawings to show the changes in each model. The B&W; photos are very crisp, clear with helpful captions. 2 pages of color plates to show camoflage patterns. A section discusses the use of the plane in Hungarian service which adds interest.Definately recommended for modelers or aviation buffs. Not a lot out there on this plane since it was not one of Wllly Messerschmitt's better designs."
4,The Deadliest Tornado Historically Depicted,"The Tri-State tornado is the deadliest tornado to affect the United States since weather records have been kept. Since this event took place in 1925, survivors with a clear memory are becoming few and far between. Fortunately, the author has clearly documented not only the stories of survivors, but the atmospheric conditions that existed during the event and the struggles of attempting forensic meteorology. Considering how sparse the data is for an event so far in the past, I'm pleased that the author was able to accomplish this much. Events like this will happen again and, much to my disappointment, there is no way to determine if the Tri-State tornado was one single tornado track (which it appears to be) or a family of large, violent long-track tornadoes."
5,1925 Tornado,This book was very informative. I live in Murphysboro where there were almost 300 lives lost my Mother Father and other family were all affected by this event. I have heard first hand stories. So this book hit me personnally as well as informatively.
3,"Arrived quickly, but damaged","This item arrived quickly as I had hoped, but when I opened it I discovered that one of the wheels was bent. This did not appear to be from shipping as the box had no visible signs of damage, nor did the paint on the reel appear to be scratched. It looks like a manufacturing defect to me personally. I filed a claim and I hope to get a replacement soon, although Northern Tool has not responded yet. I will update this review at a later date."
4,Dio continues to impress,"I was a Dio fan back in the 80s, and bought several of his albums (Holy Diver, Last In Line, and also his Black Sabbath stuff). Later I bought Lock Up The Wolves, and was impressed with the growth I saw, there. He was going outside the norm a bit with rhythms. I like to be surprised or to hear something a little interesting or off in my music. Dio has never strayed too far from the expected, but there were some interesting bits and good songs on Lock Up The Wolves.Strange Highways goes a little further down that path while still retaining a very listenable and heavy feel. The band takes some chances and lands on its feet every time.My only complaint is that I'm sometimes left wanting more -- I want Dio to take some of the musical ideas he flirts with further outside. I felt like maybe they tried to rein in the 'strangeness' at points to keep some commerical sound. Probably listening to the advice of some ARO guy.Anyway, this is a heavy, excellent CD."
4,DIO in top form!,"What makes this album so good is Ronnie's inspirational performance on vocals. He sings every song as if it's his last and delivers metal classics like PAIN and EVILUTION with plenty of passion and anger. The album kicks off with possibly Dio's worst ever song, JESUS MARY & THE HOLY GHOST (I'm sure I've step on a few toes here) but from that point on, STRANGE HIGHWAYS fulfils every classic heavy metal criteria. It easily eclipses Dio's previous effort LOCK UP THE WOLVES, and only misses out on five stars because I thought Tracy G was surely capable of a bit more twiddly-diddly work on his guitar. GREAT STUFF!"
5,The heaviest and darkest album by DIO,"When I heard the album ""Dehumanizer"" by Black Sabbath, I thought: there is nothing heavier and darker in this mucis style. But when I heard ""Strange Highways"", I changed my mind. This album is doom-metal classic."
4,A,"This ia an album I finally bought after I never had when it first was released. I think it is a great album, but would not put it at the top of the list."
2,Not the DIO of the 80's,"I was very dissapointed with this CD. Don't get me wrong I have been a Ronnie James Dio fan for a long time. In fact, I love all of his music that was made in 1980's. This CD however did not do it for me. It seemed as if he was trying hard to do what seemed to come so naturally 10 years before.I would highly recommend any of the DIO compact Discs from the 80's but not this CD."
2,Strange CD,"This CD is pritty sick , better than Angry Machines ,as good as Dehumanizer which is also sick .Dio's lyrics are Evil yet intriguing . Tracy G is on fire . Machines was the leftovers of this, and 5 tracks of nothing .This has alot incommon with Humanizer , Fans of Zakk Wyldde may like this , Very different approach to song writing , some thrash riffs too :)"
3,Only above average,"Ronnie's voice remains in true form, but the music here isn't as powerful or emotional as his work with Sabbath or his albums from the early and mid 1980s. There is a similar dullness to these songs and they all sound very similar. I can't criticize his voice however. While other 80s metal icons have lost there range, Dio maintains his. Maybe he just needs better musicians around him, or at least better chemistry."
3,"DIO, where's your magic?","As a faithful fan of Ronnie James Dio's, I was really disappointed by this disc. The music is all too mechanical, and the lyrics (Ronnie's trademark since his Rainbow days) have somehow lost their depth, too. The only reason this record gets 3 stars is that there are still songs with traces of Dio's past brilliance (""Jesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost"", ""Strange Highways"" and especially ""Give Her the Gun""). Unfortunately, Dio's next studio effort (""Angry Machines"") is even worse. We can only hope that someday in the future the real Dio will come back from the cold and blow us all away."
2,Snooze,"Very plodding, unoriginal piece of work. Have all of Dios albums and when I got this one I listened to it twice and threw it on the heap. Come on Dio, go back to Holy Diver and Last in Line material!"
3,globe,"Good quality and colors matched picture.Mailed promptly and packaged well. Although dimensions were specified, it was much smaller than expected"
5,I like it,"It lookes beautiful, has nice design, and doesn't cost a lot. I like how you can touch all the mountains on the globe, since its surface isn't smooth, it has like reliefs where mountains are located. We like this globe very much! When it arrived, it didn't have a single scratch (I always like to point it out, because not everything I order arrives in excellent condition)!"
1,nicely laid out book,"Olander's book exhibits excellent promotion and hype, not skilled fish prints. Although he uses color fairly well, the technical aspects of his printing leave a bit to be desired, and design elements are lacking. It's a shame that this book is used as an example of fine printing, when it is not at all. For some excellent and stunning fish prints, check out the website of the Fish Print Factory in Japan. Although these are done in the indirect method vice Olander's direct, there is an exemplary use of color, shading, tones, balance, and design."
3,"lots of gorgeous prints, very little technical info","If you are looking for technical information regarding gyotaku, this book will not help you much at all. In that case, you will be much better served by considering Bethmann's ""Nature Printing with Herbs, Fruits & Flowers"" which has a small gyotaku section. If you are looking for examples of artistic presentation of gyotaku prints, this book provides 53 color plates of fish prints done by the author. That's not what I was looking for (sigh)."
4,a western perspective on a japanese technique,"A beautiful book. I picked up this book out of curiosity and was impressed by the quality of the prints themselves. It made me want to go out and print some fish myself. My only complaint is that I wanted to see some more detailed writing on technique, though his comentary (on each print) in terms of the different breeds and catching of the fish involved was entertaining and disarmingly free of pretentions."
3,baffling,"This lens hood makes me feel stupid, and I have a PhD. How on earth does it attach to the lens? It sits on the front quite nicely, but it doesn't latch or lock. What are the ""clips"" the first reviewer talks about? Am I missing something? Please, someone enlighten me! Thanks. :)"
5,Gone Crazy by Buggy Barn,This book contains several very interesting quilt patterns. It was in verygood condition when I received it and it was delivered a very short while after I ordered. I am very pleased with both the book and the sender.
5,A must have book for any lover of the victorian era,I purchased this book to get ideas for a dollhouse I was making. This book gave me many wonderful ideas and inspirations! There are so many detailed pictures giving us a true look into the Victorian Era. Not only did I get ideas for the outside of my dollhouse. I got some great ideas for some of the rooms on the inside of my dollhouse. And what a wonderful surprise to find a picture of the bed and breakfast that I spent my honeymoon in!
3,Interesting but not enough close up pics,"We are renovating a 1900's home and hoped there would be ample photos to help us choose our new color scheme. The book had good info but was short on close up photos and did not provide detailed info on paint colors.Will be donating to the local library, am sure others will find it beneficial."
4,Incredible! Beautiful! went out and bought one to paint!,"We were so inspired by the beauty and detail of the Pomada/Larsen Painted Ladies series that we searched and searched until we could find one locally to paint. Alas, the title of How to create your own painted lady by the same authors can't be found..... Anyone know where we can get a copy?"
5,"EXCELLENT Model Reference: Beautiful Pictures, Beautiful Homes","Believe it or not but the main reason I purchased this beautiful book was for reference material for scale model building (i.e. LEGO, etc.). I was hunting forever for a book on Victorian homes--with pictures of the OUTSIDE (as most of the books on Victorian architecture deal with the classic interior designs, furniture, etc.). LEGO and Victorian homes go hand in hand, as this book's wonderful color pictures perfectly illustrate--who could imagine such combinations would actually look so stunning!? In addition to excellent photography the text is well written, with interesting facts about each home, why it's unique, yet how it fits into the overall ""Painted Lady"" lineage... excellent. :-)"
2,a difficult language confusingly rendered,"I have used a lot of language tools and classes, and this is hands down the most confusing. Maybe I'm a slower study than the others who reviewed this book, but learning seems quite inefficient. This is because grammar is not explained well (often times the explanations are incomplete, or the reader is told to just ""study these examples"") and the topics seem to bounce around. That's unfortunate, because Basque is so different from English. A more intuitive unfolding of grammar would help the reader a lot. I've learnt Greek and Japanese with greater ease, and I would guess that those languages are just as difficult for the native English speaker. Unfortunately, there's really not much of a choice for anyone who wants to learn Basque -- there's just nothing out there."
5,"Washington DC, only a few years ago!","I gave this book to my students to read because it is set in Washington DC where our school is located. Many of them had no idea of what our city was like during their parents lifetime. The book set up lively discussions and the students said it helped them understand our country better.Charles Drew was an extraordinary Freedom Fighter and surgeon who always""Dreamed High"""
2,This book is only for beginners,"This book is really only for beginners. If you know nothing about viral marketing than start here, but realistically a google search for ""viral marketing. (...)"
3,overstates the obvious,"Sorry, but I found this book rather flat. The author's thesis is rather obvious, and while it has some value as a source of enthusiasm/inspiration, it's not particularly insightful. Save your money and buy some books to read to your kid."
4,??,"Great songs from the 80's...but what is that song that plays right after when Julia throws the music sheets, and then Robbie goes to the bar??"
4,Re: the song the old lady sings to her husband,"I don't actually have the soundtrack, but I love the movie! The song the old lady sings is called ""Till there was you"" and it's from an old musical, but I don't remember the name of it! I hope that helps! Good luck."
1,I HAVE A QUESTION?,what is the name of the song that is played during the wedding in which adam sandler gets stood up by the chic?? it is being played by the orchestra....its amazing!! and i dont kno the name of it...could someone please help me out. thanks
3,Adam Singing,"I think this CD would be a lot better if they had Adam Sandler sing the songs he sung in the movie instead of the original artist. Also, on the first CD, George singing ""Do you really want to hurt me."" I would definately buy it if it were more ""personal"" to the movie."
4,Both of the Wedding Singer Soundtracks are great.,I missed much of the 80's music. After viewing The Wedding Singer I became interested in the music of that decade. These two CD's sum up some the best artists and songs of that era. I highly recomend these two albums.
4,Money That is What I Want,"While I may not have been old enough in the 80's to really get into the music seen, good or bad as case may be... I do enjoy my fair share of 80's music now however. Afer seeing ""Empire Records"" I went around for days sining ""Money, that is what I want"", as soon as I was able to get to a music store I cought the CD hoping that the song would be on it, to my horror it was not! (It is still a really good CD and I highly recomend it.) But meanwhile back to the song. So then when I saw ""The Wedding Singer"" and the song was in it I was in heaven. And much to my disapointment when I went out and got the CD, lisining to it first this time, the song once again was not on it. And then CD parte Deux came out and it is on there. So the song it wonderful and so is the rest of the CD, and that is all I have to say."
2,Wanted to hear Adam Sandler sing more songs.,Disapointed. I wanted to hear Adam Sandler sing the songs from the movie
3,"Good ,but where the hell is 99 Luftballoons?","That song rocks!! That's the only that's holding me back from buying this farchking cd. It was in the movie, why can't they deliver!"
2,Vol II Another Disappointment!!,"Bought volume II because ""Grow Old Together"" wasn't on the cd and needed the song for a DJ gig I was performing.The blasted song lasts about a minute on volume II and the CD itself is a disappointment like Vol I. Great movie but the CD volumes are lacking...Goofy Reviewed and Labeled DISAPPOINTMENT!!"
5,very satisfied customer,Everything was great. The product is seriously like brand new. I recommend and would use this seller again.
5,Finally found it!,"Aahh...the uniqueness of 80s music. Been looking for the Flying Lizards ""Money"" song since then. It's been on several movie sound tracks however it never made it on the 'sound track CD' until now. ""Leisure Rules"""
4,Solid sountrack if you liked the movie,"This movie was a favorite in our household and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the DVD, so we searched for the soundtrack. I actually chose this volume over volume 1 for two reasons...it contains the favorite from the movie, ""I want to grow old with you"" actually sung by Adam Sandler and secondly, because Volume 1 contains the song that Adam Sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend, which contains quite a bit of profanity, so I didn't want to get it for my kids. I would have given it five stars, but we find the introduction by Billy Idol at the start of the last track, ""I want to grow old with you,"" which is dialog from the movie, to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song, which I mentioned was the absolute favorite."
5,a classic,This should be a foundational book for anyone interested in the discussion between Calvinism and Arminianism. This work is very balanced in its rendition.
4,straight from the crib,i got this cd from a friend. and they are going to be hot. my ride dog john blaze and i did alot of things together and i know they'll wake the whole nation. holla at me j.b. (sheltdog). keep the beats tight. peace to you all shelt.
1,BLOODRAW IS OCALA CROWN HOLDER,THUG PIMP MUSIC TRACKS ARE PLAN THE PRODUCTION NEEDS SOME WORK AND ONLY 2 OF THE MEMBERS HAVE A SPARK TO THEM THE REST OF THEM NEED TO PRACTICE A LITTLE MORE I HAVE HEARD EVERY GROUP FROM OCALA AND BLOODRAW IS THE STAND OUT TO ME. (...)
1,Made me feel AWFUL,"I took this product for the first time today and since taking It have had nausea,have been light headed, stomach cramps and generally felt terrible, i have asked others on my facebook if they have used this product and 3 others have had same side effects, I have contacted tescos where I got this and advised them that they should remove this product from the shelves as I feel it is unsafe without a prescription !!"
5,water pills,Works very well. I have a problem retaining fluids and without going on percription medication I tried these and these seem to work fine. I have had no problems and only take them when I need them.
3,didn't work for me,"unfortunetaly, i didn't notice any real effect of the product on me compared to other leading brand :("
1,not worth it,This product was very inexpensive but very ineffective. I am hoping and praying they will put Nicki Haskell's Starcaps back on the market...a diuretic that is very expensive but very effective!!!
3,Aqua Ban,Agua Ban is a non prescription way of getting rid of bloating problems. I only use it when my menstrual cycle is beginning.
1,HORRIBLE BAD TERRIBLE,"I LOVED EVERY OF HER SONGS BEFORE THIS ON NOW IN A MINUTE AND AT THE BEGINING, BUT THIS WAS HORRIBLE SONG WRITTING. I DONT THINK THIS ALBUM IS WORTH THE MONEY, BUY NOW IN A MINUTE INSTED."
1,"Very different from ""Now in a Minute""","IMHO ""Blue Planet"" is far from being as good as ""Now in a Minute"". One might consider it as more ""experimental"" especially with respect to her voice (which really sounds strange on this album: sometimes too high, sometimes with a strange bass in it) and the beat of the songs. But what I am really missing on this CD are honestly emotional songs like ""Mother"" or ""Silent World"" from ""Now in a Minute"". Thus you should be a really great fan of her or at least listen to the CD before buying it."
3,Beautiful music + dizty lyrics = Kitcsh,I was hoping something that was a little more like Madonna's RAY OF LIGHT but I guess I was hoping for too much. A weak voice and horrible lyrics that overuse the word 'love' and nature symbolism bog down some really great melodies. Lewis needs a lyricst and a more powerful singer for her songs.
3,It could have been a little better...3/5 stars...,"I bought this cd because, I thought it was going to be like her first album. This album wasn't bad, it just seems like it was missing something. But, there are a few good tracks on there like: ""Will Love Grow"", ""I Could Be The One"", ""Love Him"", & ""Unforgiven"". Out of all the 11 tracks on this cd, I do like 9 of them. This album could've been a little better Her first album was better. Buy it anyway, you might like it."
3,Cool,"I think this album is good, but not better than the first one, to say the truth I was kind of disappointed!"
4,A pretty decent album...,"This album is better than her first one. Personally i found ""I Love You Always Forever"" from the first album a bit annoying, but i really liked ""I Could Be the One"" in this album. Listen to both [albums] and make your own judgement. If you don't subscribe to the ""first is always better"" ideology, then there's not much to complain about in this album."
4,Great second release,"This is Donna Lewis' follow-up, but lesser known release to her highly successful debut ""Now in a Minute"". I've always liked her unique harmonies, catchy choruses and provocative lyrics, which she gives us more of here in songs exploring classic romantic themes, as well as some more serious cuts concerning things like mortality and perhaps an homage to the environment with her titular song ""Blue Planet"". If you enjoy her breathy vocals and disco-tinged ballads, this is great compliment to her first CD."
4,Pop at it's best,"Donna Lewis is one of the greatest contemporary singer song writters and at the same time, one of the most underrated ones. Don't let the childish voice to mislead you ! This CD is full of inspiration and sensuality - a divine soothing breeze for a cynical hi-thec age.As an avid rock fan, I find Donna lewis as a superb pop artist."
3,"Actually, it's supposed to be Season 5 of Buffy.","And I say that as the author. It takes place in Season Five, just after the death of Buffy's mom. Spike wasn;t really tight with the scooby's at teh time and was still trying to deal with his own strong feelings for Buffy. Trust me, I'm a long time fan of the show and would not make an error like that.That was an editorial error. And yes, actually, teh description of Spike as posted from the book is from Xander's perspective. Even at their closest and chummiest, they have never been friends. Not even in Seasons six or Seven. Also, I've read most of the books and own every episode of the show.Having said all of that, sorry if you didn't like the book, it IS my first attempt at a Buffy novel, and if I am fortunate enough to get another.I'm also a big fan of Spike (Though my wife is, understandably, a BIGGER fan.).PS The three star review just reflects teh current average. They MADE me put in a star rating"
3,"A little REASON, shall we?","To Susan Guberman-Garcia: I have not read this book. I do know that it's based on a computer game. That means that the author had little choice in plot for the book, and it's a good bet he's not a big Buffy fan. If I were you, and anyone else reading this review, I would run to the library and get practically any Buffy Book by Christopher Golden or Nancy Holder, or both. Try the excellent ""GateKeeper"" trilogy for grownups, or ""The Lost Slayer"" for the younger set. There were times while reading those books that I could actually hear the actors speaking the dialog, it was so dead-on. Don't judge all Buffy books by this one!!"
3,Super Reader,"Apparently this one is based on the second Buffy game, so we have the alternate reality extras things going on with Sid the dummy and Kakistos the vampire. Add in Faith and Spiker.Ethan Rayne and The First are playing a little game, but Sid is the wild card they didn't know about, and he isn't pleased with The First for trapping him in the dummy body.So, he tells Buffy about Cassandra Rayne, one of Ethan's ancestors and the Dagger of Hope she has that can vanquish The First. The only problem is, that she is immortal, and her remains have been dispersed across a very wide area.Also, this book has an amazing amount of carnage, more vampire slayings and monster killings than in many others put together. If you are after monster bashing, this book is for you."
2,Just Play The Game,"The story that was developed for the game was an interesting one. As a big fan of the game I found myself unable to resist buying the book as well. However, I was absolutely disappointed with the book. I thought it was written very poorly and lacked the ""flow"" of many of the other buffy or angel centered books I have read. After a few chapers I tossed it at the bottom of my locker and never finished it. Perhaps it gets better if you can get past the first quarter of the book, but in my opinion if you are looking for the story just play the game."
5,Don't find this on the radio,I probably prefer Straplight but when it comes to Billy Nayer there are a few things on every album which make them well worth the money for me. They live somewhere between nursery rhymes and the liquid nightmares of Buwkoski. However the always engaging voice of Cory McAbee makes this marriage disturbingly appealing. If you like music which is like nothing you have heard before this is it. Woven from the trash heap of lost and forgotten cords a multicolored cloth springs forth. Wrap it around your head and jump down the rabbit hole.
4,Rabbit,"This is my first Billy Nayer album. If you are intrigued by oddities, spend $9 and listen to it yourself. It is well worth it. Its quality talent in a refreshingly bizarre listen."
2,Lemonheads,"My girlfriend has this CD. I never even heard of these dudes. But somethimes when my girlfriend is driving she has this CD on in her car and just something about the way she drives and she's sunk way down in her seat with the rearview mirror slanted all the way down, and something about the way she mouths the words but doesn't actually sing out loud, and something about the way her hair is always too long in her face and the way her car always smells like pink roses. Its just really cool. Otherwise I would never in a million years listen to this stuff."
4,"All good, no lemons.","As stated, this is the best of the Atlantic years, hence no early material. Most of what's here is very foot-tappin' and happy. If your interested in the singles from the last few cd's, then this is what you want. Included is ""Into your arms"", ""If I could talk I'd tell you"", and 5 tracks from the ""It's a Shame about Ray"" album. Actually, that album is just as good as this collection is in my opinion. If you enjoy artists such as ""Juliana Hatfield"" and ""Toad the wet sprocket"", you'll like either of these Lemonheads cd's. Let's hope Evan can get some more music out soon."
2,It's a spam,"I bought two of these as we moved near high powerlines. One of the pieces arrived non-working, but I was lazy and didn't ship it back. I later asked PGE to come take EMF reading around the house (they do it free, if you call their customer line). Anyway, they tried with and without this thing, and readings came same (even with their emf sensor sitting on top of it)."
4,Why don't we all have these?,"I recently found out the dangers of Electromagnetic radiation. I work with computers and TV monitors all day. I have easily been exposing myself to tons of EMF radiation. I bought one of these to see the results. I need four more to get my house covered. It seems odd that we are all surrounded by electronics on a major level and we are not protecting our natural bodies from the dangerous byproducts. I received the EMF Filter in just two days. The picture on Amazon doesn't show how well constructed it is. And the price was much less than the one shown. Plainlywrapped has got nicer ones than shown. It was easy to plug in and worked right away. Once I put these in all the rooms of my house I will have eliminated all the electromagnetic radiation emitted. I know I feel safer, I wish we all had these."
3,"A very entertaining, easy read.","It is a very simple, yet facsinating story. Those that appreciate real life scenarios vis-a-vis the usual material that is published, will greatly appreciate this book. It is a very fast read and perhaps its true appeal is the suppleness of the language the author uses."
4,Don't give up at the beginning,"It took me over a week to get through the first 50 pages of Dorothy Gilman's ""Mrs. Pollifax Unveiled."" But once I made it that far, I was rewarded by a satisfactory entry in the Pollifax canon. I was so lost at the beginning of the book. Circumstances and characters seemed to be popping out of nowhere with none of the usual cohesiveness. I was very annoyed. But, as the story progressed, Gilman seemed to find her muse. The last two-thirds of the book read much more quickly than the confusing beginning. While this book lacked some of the charm and polish of Gilman's other Pollifax stories, I would still recommend it."
5,Mrs. Polifax Wins Again,Good read. Contains much current info re Middle East culture/politics . Mrs. Polifax proves that ingenuity will not end with age.
4,Gotta love Mrs. P!,"I look forward to new Mrs. Pollifax adventures like a kid in a candy store. Opening a new Mrs. Pollifax book is like joining an old friend. Although her earlier adventures are a little more fun, I suspect it is because she was more ""unexpected"" ;-) at the beginning. Still, as always, it is a fun, enjoyable, entertaining romp!For anyone new to the Emily Pollifax series, start at the beginning with ""The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax"" and read them in order!"
4,Don't miss out on Dorothy Gilman,"Fun fun fun. I highly recommend all of Dorothy Gilman's Mrs. Pollifax books just for the pure escapist, fun of reading about an ""older"" woman who knows how to take care of herself!"
5,loved it,Mrs Pollifax is so delightful. I love the suspense that is enough to keep me interested but not so scary that I can't sleep. I am trying to read all of Dorothy Gilman's books. She is very good.
4,Mrs. Pollifax in Seria,"Just when Mrs. Pollifax begins to get restless, Bishop comes to her home to offer her another adventure for the CIA. This time she and her old friend Farrell are asked to find a young girl named Amanda who rescued 200 people from being hijacked on a plane and then disappeared. There are the requisite number of chases, strange-looking people following them, adventures and misadventures for this book to join the others in the enjoyable Mrs. Pollifax series. The one thing that puzzles me is why Dorothy Gilman had her heroine marry Cyrus in one of the early books and then have him serve as background, always off on his own business when Emily does another assignment for the CIA. Perhaps she received negative feedback from readers when Cyrus accompanied her on one of her adventures, but it seems too bad to shove such a nice man into the background."
3,In Strange Places Where There Is Danger.,"Emily Pollifax has gone through a lot of dangerous adventures since Dorothy Gilman created her best known character in the '70s. She was known as a super sleuth as a CIA (?) secret agent on assignments in unusual places. Some of the fifteen or so titles called her amazing, elusive, pursued, unexpect, and innocent. She survived many death-defying situations like being locked overnight in a medieval Swiss Castle.For a Garden Club member from New Brunswick, New Jersey, she found herself in many tight spots, like her espionage assignament in Morrocco, Turkey, in the 'Whirling Dervish.' This one is similar as she balks an airplane terrorist. You can always find her in foreign locales while her husband carries on at home. I can't choose which is my favorite, but Mrs. Gilman has been a most prolific writer and creator of Mrs. Pollifax."
3,Disappointing rehash,"After having read all the previous Mrs. Pollifax books I had been looking forward to reading this one, but found it rather disappointing. While the plot sounds like that of the other books the execution of the story is not up to the usual standard. It lacks the potential to identify with the characters, and even worse Mrs. Pollifax and Farell are both fairly flat characters. The new characters (Amanda and Joe) are a bit more lively, but still two dimensional. And the usual bunch of minor characters that give the other books their liveliness are either missing or just make a perfunctionary appearance. This book reads like a draft for the story before the characters get fully developed. Not a bad bad read, but not really worth buying."
2,Iso shampoo,"I love the shampoo, but when I received it the top was open and a lot had leaked out of the bottle!!"
5,Perfect Shampoo for Static in hair,"LOVE this shampoo!! I have been using for many years and I have not found another shampoo that can control static in my hair, especially over the winter. Paired with the daily conditioner, hair is static free all day."
3,Fun TV Disaster Thriller,"Definitely not a great film, but a fun one. A TV version of one of the Airport/Plane disaster flicks. Jackson is the head stewardess and surrogate mom and a lot of B-grade 70's and 80's actors make up the rest of the cast. Erik Estrada, Maureen McCormick, Ed Marinaro ... anyway a storm blows up and kills the cockpit folk, so it's up to Kate and Company to save the plane and passngers. They have altitude and oxygen problems, gally fires, stray vicious dogs, rolling leaking cars and criminals all on the loose. BUT - it is definitely entertaining and rewatchable. Silly, yes, thrilling, at times, and so over the top. You almost can't help yourself in getting caught up in all the drama. A fun TV flick."
1,Annoyed...,"I read all the reviews before buying this scale, so I felt pretty good about my purchase. Unfortunately, it doesn't work... at all, ever. Now I have to send it back, which is an enormous pain in the you know what. I'm sure it's just a fluke, but still major inconvenience!"
4,in this price range I like it,"I read many reviews before buying this scale. Although all digital scales have some errors, this scale is pretty accurate, especially if you put it on hard surface. In this price range it is one of the best choices. It's recomandable."
4,good,"More than 3 months, still good. Only one little problem. When I first stand on it, it shows 100lbs, then my friend step on, it's 160 lbs, and then I step again, it shows 100.5 or 101 lbs. And if I change the scale from LBS to KG, it doesn't match, like 0.5kg more or less.Anyway, I'm satisfied with it."
4,a good scale,"It is an okay scale. When I check my weight, and repeat a few minutes later my weight is slightly different. I have not found a very accurate scale yet, and I think having this one is better than having nothing at all."
5,Works well so far,"Gives a stable reading for general weight reduction needs, well for past few weeks of owning this!"
4,Digital scale works well,"This is an ""easy to read"" scale that calibrates at each reading. The numbers are easily readable but they don't stay visible but for a few seconds so read it quickly! (Have your glasses ready!). It is light weight and has a ""recall"" button to keep a record of weight. It *does* differ a few pounds off, however, with the scales at WEIGHT WATCHERS' meeting!!"
5,Weber's Big Book of Grilling,"Outdoor cooking is a year-round activity here in the desert. So, I was happy to add this book to my collection. So far every recipe tried has been a gem - uncomplicated and good. The text is worth the price of admission to this one!"
5,Best cookbook I have ever had!!!!,"I got a grill for a wedding present, and when I bought this book, my wife has not been able to pry me away from the grill! Everything I have tried from this book has been outstanding. My friends say I've become quite a gourmet. My wife says she will never cook again, which is no great loss."
5,Every Recipe is Amazing!,"Every recipe we have tried has been wonderful. We have an outdoor kitchen and entertain often - all of our friends are impressed with these recipes! We love the Mediterranean Chilean Sea Bass - but, we leave out the lavender. The grilled pears and pound cake with caramel sauce gets rave reviews as well. Best cookbook we have ever used!"
5,Great Reference,"I bought this book from amazon along with my weber grill a couple of months ago. I was a novice when i bought both but always enjoyed my parents bbq and wanted to learn the art myself. This book is amazing just for its advice on how to cook certain meats, and includes seafood and vegtables also. I now consider myself intermediate at grilling and i attribute all of that success to this book. it motivates you to broaden your horizons, and that's probably the best thing about the book. no complaints what-so-ever."
4,A well-seasoned read,"This BIG book proved to be everytyhing I expected. Tons of recipes, grilling basics, lots of pictures, lots of ideas. And a great price! What's not to like?"
4,Weber's Big Book of Grilling,"It's a decnt book, but I wish it had more on marinades/brines to keep meat moist during the grilling process. I am brand new to grilling, so it does have a plethora of great tips."
5,Best cookbook EVER,"There is nothing better than a recipe that works. And if it is on the grill, even better. Jamie Purviance is one of the best cookbook authors. His recipes work, the instructions are easy to follow, and the books are chocked full of good advice, handy tips and funny stories. This one is one of the best. Not only is the food fantastic, the photos for each chapter are great! My favorite is the seafood section photo. Very funny!! A must have for any level of griller."
4,Great book with a lot of ideas,"I like this book because it contains a lot of practical information that you can apply in a general and it has enough specific recipes that are really good that is worth the shelf space. With the large form factor and thick glossy full color pages it is pleasing on the eyes. It does not have every recipe that I wanted, but I think everyone could find a few great recipes that would become family favorites."
5,Hot item!,"This cookbook is very well written,easy to follow and gives a lot of hints for grilling that actually work! Love the pictures and the recipes are from simple to fancy,but it is well explained. A must have for the outdoor grillers."
5,Like everyone is saying...,"this book is awesome! What I like about the book is that the recipes are real - the Asian recipes use things like fish sauce,hoisin sauce, sesame oil, fresh cilantro,and rice wine, rather than a bottle of teriyaki sauce from the store. I think that may intimidate some cooks, but trust me - just give it a try - once you have those types of ingredients on hand, you can make all kinds of new dishes. We've made probably 25 recipes from this book so far, and they're all great. If you like to grill, and aren't afraid of a little experimenting, this is the book for you!"
5,Jam-Packed Grilling Guide,"From appetizers right through to desserts, you can go grill-crazy with this book absolutely jam-packed with recipes. How to's on barbecuing everything from the traditional beef, lamb and poultry to the less common rabbit, turkey and buffalo. Marinades and sauces are also included because, let's face it, a good piece of grilled meat just isn't complete if it's not smothered with a tasty sauce. So, get out the Weber and dive into this book. There are enough fantastic recipes for a barbecue a day to last a whole year, with some left over for next year."
5,THE grilling cookbook,"Weber's BIG BOOK of Grilling is out of this world!! I purchased this book along with Weber's Art of The Grill and while they are both great I would pick this one over ""Art"" for an all around grilling cookbook. This was a VERY well thought out book, it is easy to find what you are looking for and offers great advice for beginners to grilling. It is broken down into food ""groups"" and then delves into each group with a nice assortment of recipes. The best thing about grilling with an actual Weber grill and using this cookbook is that if you follow the recipe you can't go wrong. It truly can take you from the ""You burned the burgers Again!!"" to ""Wow these are great burgers"". I really could go on and on about this book but I won't, just trust me and purchase it, you will not regret it."
5,The Only Grilling Book You'll Ever Need!,"This ""bible"" of grilling not only has delicious recipes for any type of food you could possibly imagine (including rare meats such as buffalo, pheasant, and desserts), but it gives you helpful tips on choosing a grill, using a grill properly, selecting the best cuts of meat, and wine/beer pairings with specific meats.A DEFINITE must-buy for any grill enthusiast!"
3,Great recipes but useless index,"The book and recipes are great. No questions about that. But the index in this book is really useless.You can only search for the exact recipe name but not for the type of food.This really needs to be reworked.Some examples:You are looking for ribs. Try to look up ribs or spare ribs. You will not find anything unless you look under ""p"" for pork ribs or ""p"" for pineapple hoisin beef ribs.Same for Tri-Tip. No luck under ""T"". But you find it under ""R"" like Rosemary Tri Tip.I like the book but if you try to find some recipes for certain types of food you have to scan through the whole book since the index does not help at all."
3,grilling book,"the book is ok, it gives some good tips and ideas. Some of the recipes are a little confusing. It also seems like a few of the meals i have prepared can get pretty expensive. Maybe it is just the ones that looked good to me"
4,A great book,"I gave this book to my husband, who does not cook at all. It gives thorough and understandable instructions, and he can't wait to get started grilling! I highly recommend this book. The only grilling book you need."
4,Great Book from Weber,"This book is great for novice to expert grillers. Grilling being the key to this book unlike other ""BBQ"" books this is centered toward people who grill-that being those of us who don't always want to deal with thick sauces or have the time to slow roast things for hours. There are some recipies for BBQ but most are straight forward, simple but delicious meals that can be completed in under an hour. I have many grilling/bbq books and this is by far the one I go to the most! Some of the recipies in the book are online but there are many that are not. If you are looking for a grilling book this is the one, if your more into BBQ & Smoking food you might want to try the Bar-B-Q Bible or other such books."
3,Weber's Big Book of Grilling,"While ""Weber's Big Book of Grilling"" has a lot of information, it is geared more toward recipes for sauces and marinades than actual grilling and barbecuing. For the novice who needs tips on the actual grilling process, it falls far short. I found little to help in becoming good in grilling.I doubt I will open it much again, and am still looking for a good book to tell me what I need to know in the actual grilling process."
5,This book makes grillmasters,"I have never once been led astray by Weber's Big Book of Grilling. From grilling techniques to marinades to side dishes, this book is absolutely indispensable.I love grilling, it's my favorite kind of cooking, but there's no need to be snobby about it like some other cookbooks and barbecue shows, and the Big Book understands. It's unpretentious with its recipes and descriptions, and the recipes themselves are flexible enough to make them mine.Some of the highlights:1. Best salmon I've ever eaten came from a recipe and techniques in this book.2. Satay marinade: good with not only beef, but shrimp.3. Scallops and chili sauce: yes, the Big Book can do chili sauce.4. Grilled lamb that my roommates lined up to try.Behind this grillmaster is the Weber's Big Book of Grilling!"
5,Lets try for 30 stars!!!!!!,The best bbq book I have every had the joy of using (and I have lots of them). Try out the Grilled Asparagus with Tarragon Butter on Page 341. Wow - also the crab cakes - need I go on? The explanations regarding direct and indirect grilling methods are concise and well thought out - I bought one and have more on order for others - enjoy and buy!!!!
5,Absolutely No-Fail Grilling Everytime!,"This book is an absolute must for anyone looking for great grilling techniques & recipes! I am an avid cook & have tried dozens of recipes out of this cookbook - everyone was a hit. Although we don't have a Weber grill, the times & temperatures listed in each recipe guarantees success. You won't be disappointed...."
5,A Ton of Tasty Recipes from the Grilling Guru,"Chef Purviance has excelled once again. The appropriately named ""Big Book"" is so deliciously written and beautifully photographed that with the addition of a few dollops of one of Purviance's tasty marinades it too might taste pretty good. But before you start gnawing on the pages of this opus to outdoor cooking, try a few of the recipes. You'll find, as I have, that not only are each of Chef Purviance's creative masterpieces relatively easy to prepare, but that they can be paired to create multi-course meals from appetizers to dessert. The range of toothsome delights in the Big Book not only includes every conceivable food group, but also reflects the culinary traditions of dozens of grill-crazy cultures. Equipped only with my Weber, the Big Book and a few choice ingredients, I intend to conduct a chef's tour of the world this summer, without leaving my backyard. Hail to Chef Purviance and the folks at Weber."
5,Works Just Fine,This 4 way valve Is the same quality at the Gilmour 2 way valve It will survive high pressure and freezing cold weather better than most especially plastic. One of the uses I have for It washing machines now days do Not allow hot Water on the last wash cycle so I use this to adjust the Water temperature but You do have to make custom hose fittings and stuff to do that.
1,Leaks and breaks!,"I am now using the third one of these manifolds. The previous two always leaked at the plastic inlet nut. When I tightened it, it comepetely separated from the body, and that was the end! Orbit was kind enough to supply this third one. I have installed it and I am waiting for results. So far, to my suprise, no leaks--it is OK."
3,useful,i used it for connecting all the water inflatables together to have a great big fun in my side yard but problem was that all infatables WAS sharing the connector that not enough water flowed in all the inflatables to shoot water out of it. can only connect two for full affect of the inflatables. Still it was useful for multi tasking outside.
2,Lasted only 6 weeks!,"I liked the features of this model, the brass construction and metal ball valves. However, it only lasted six weeks. Today I discovered the brass neck had broken clean off under the plastic collar. I had mounted it with the support bar in order to take the strain from the weight of four hoses off the four way connector. I am very disappointed by the sudden failure. I had hoped for better durability from this product, even though several other users had complained about this problem."
2,poor,Several of the plastic tip out containers are broken from shipping or handling. One of the bins that holds the containers is also cracked. They still work just not as nice looking.
4,"A wonderful novel, a different Jaime B","Y de repente un angel can possibly be the long awaited novel by Jaime Bayly that is a reflection of his true writing ability. In this novel Jaime B stays clear of his regular themes- homosexuality and bisexuality and relates a wonderful story of a writer who hires a maid who is an illiterate woman in her fifties. Julio Beltran, the protagonist is intrigued by her past and decides to help Mercedes find her mother who sold her when she was young girl. Intertwined in this main story, we get a sense of the class structure in Peru, social issues and Julio's personal strife which is a possible reflection of Jaime Bayly's plight with his own family.Y de repente an angel, is well written, intriguing and captivating. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy Jaime Bayly's writing style or to anyone who is looking for a novel with an interesting plot."
5,super interesting book...,"it was super kool book, love the story and the most important thing is u can learn a lot of it.....thank u for everything i got my book on time and i was very happy with it...."
4,great tex-mex music- good party songs,The Texas Tornados are a well blended mix Tejano music with an American twist. Good music to play at a bbq while drinking some cervesas.
5,Tex-Mex music is great dancing music!,It is good to hear Freddy Fender again. I grew up on his music along with many more superstars of Tex-Mex. Keep the fun rolling!
4,Huge bottle,"I like head and shoulder products and for the price this bottle could not go wrong. It is a little bit of thinner solution than the normal bottles purchased from a drugstore or supermarket. Also, I don't feel much of the cooling sensation."
1,poor quality,"i have been using the same shampoo for almost 15 years now so i now what it smells like and how it should feel after i use it. this is the first time i purchased a 33 oz pump packaging. i almost thought it's not the same product as 2/1 classic clean that i'm used to. i almost thought it's a knock off because it smelled different, felt different on my hands, and worst of all, it made my hair so static afterwards. i refused to accept this fact so i continued to use it for a few more times, yet i got the same results. my hair was weird after it is done being static. it was so static it stood up when i comb it. weird. i then went to a local supermarket and bought my regular size 2in1 classic clean. the item from the supermarket worked out fine. it was the end to static and weirdness. i'm really debating if i should call p&g to let them know. ugh..."
2,New formula- bad idea,"I've been using head and shoulders for many years and loved the classic clean 2in1 for my greasy but fine hair. Then they changed the formula a few months ago... Now my hair feels greasy (or waxy, as another reviewer said) as soon as it dries. I checked the ingredient list and it has been changed since the new bottle came out (bubbles on bottle design instead of just wavy blue). I confirmed the problem by going back to some old shampoo I had in a swim bag and my hair was back to normal. I called their customer service and they sent me a coupon for a new bottle (tho it was only good for a month and I never got to use it).What I really want is the old formula back! Maybe just keep it in the classic clean and mess around with the other new variations? Please, don't mess with a good thing."
3,...not great!,i think it cleans up well..but frequent washes have resulted in hair fall...but i think its because of the included conditioner..and its chemicals....
3,Gary Bradners erotic remake of the horror classic,"If you like erotic thrillers and shapeshifting horror, you should like cat people. Gary Bradners Howling trilogy combided horror thrills and erotic ones witch seems to be Bradners clam to fam. He does a good job doing that with cat people, But not as well as he did in the Howling Trilogy. Cat people is a remake of a horror classic. Its about a woman who has a dark secret. She belleves she is the last of a cat human half bread. When she gets turned on she turns into a lepord. This creats problems with her love life. Things get realy twisted when her brother shows up and wants her to breed with him and recreat there species. Basicly Bradner updates it and explores the erotic ellements of the story. The end result is an entertaning supernatural erotic thriller. Good read for a warm summer night. Its a fun book that you should read if it looks fun to you. Have fun fellow readers. Made into a decent film."
2,WEAK,"This book is lucky to get 2 stars. The only reason it did, was because it took Technet and shrunk the pages. It's more convenient than carrying around a Technet CD. There is no new information in here. If you have been using Exchange for a while, don't buy this book. If you have Technet (and know how to use it), don't buy this book. I was looking for a book that would be more in depth and help me out with troubleshooting Exchange. This book does not do that. If you have never seen Exchange and were recently hired to support 20 Echange servers across a large WAN, buy this book, otherwise look for something else."
3,Tarp/ground cover,"I used this tarp as a slightly thicker alternative for a ground cover for my tent. It is better then the typical blue tarp you get at the hardware store but not a true ""heavy duty"" but it works great for what I need. The grommets seem well made and are solidly reinforced. I have seen some negative reviews and as goes for any tarp... if you let it flap in the wind or put prolonged weight on it to support something off the ground you cannot expect it to last. Always wrap things in such a way to allow water to shed off and keep the wind from slapping it around."
5,Solid performance and well priced,"I'm using this tarp to cover a snow blower. It's thick, waterproof, and well made. I highly recommend it."
1,Poorly Made Tarp,"While the tarp arrived in a reasonable time for ground shipping, I was disappointed in the quality. It is not Super Heavy Duty as advertised. The grommets were irregular and asymetrical side to side and one was installed protruding over the edge.A previous tarp ordered from the same company was better than what I received this time which is why I reordered. Although I didn't return it, I used it ""as is"" anyway because of the necessity to cover my boat. I will not order this tarp again from this company because of their lack of quality control."
1,replacing after 10 months,"I bought this to cover an outdoor pingpong table from occasional rain, and am very disappointed. Th tarp has a huge rip and is now almost unusable. I am having to replace it after use less than one year. We live in Southern California so it only rained a few times."
2,Make them better!,"I thought that this might be a little bit better,because of the thickness. The first time I used it tied down tight on my trailer,it ripped as bad as some of the cheap ones I have bought. One trip and that was the last.Why do they make these so thin? I would rather pay a little more and get one that last awhile."
3,Nice Tarp Does Nothing for the Bottom of the Tent,Great Tarp if you are just covering up the something. For the bottom of a tent the product is not that good. It is rain proof though!
2,Not up to 24/7/365+ use,Bought one of these a little over a year ago. Seemed durable and was hoping to get a few years usage from it. It is in use and exposed to the weather 24/7. A few months ago areas of the tarp started failing/shredding and there are now big tears in a few spots.If you want to use this for temporary purpose such as placing under a tent or short term use while transporting items on a trailer or in the back of pickup truck this tarp may work just fine.For my purpose it did not.It is cheap enough that if I have to replace it every year I guess I can but I would prefer something more durable to begin with (and willing to pay more for it also!).FAIL!
5,Good quality and great value!,Excellent tarp....very good quality and it was priced well. Actually it was a better tarp at a cheaper price than what Home Depot offers.
3,Tarp satisfaction,I thought it would be a heavier type tarp. I suppose I was thinking of the old canvas type tarps and not the vinyl type that is the common thing these days. It makes a good cover but not a very good item to pack anything on.
5,Reflective surface saved us,"We had our little RV visiting my cousin when the outside temp hit 100oF. We were in her drive, plugged in with the air conditioner running full out. No trees anywhere. The temp in the van hit 92o and we couldnt take our dogs inside with her dogs. I dug this tarp out, tossed it over the van silver reflective side out, lashed it down with bungee cords and the temp dropped 10o. The summer of 2012 was so hot and we needed to use it again a couple times when our campsite was not under trees."
4,Works,I bought this tarp for a survival tent while living in Alaska. They didn't sell many tarps up there so I ordered it from amazon. I have no complaints about this product. Just an average tarp.
3,Not what I thought,"I was promised that this was a pair of rosie odonnells underwear. The size is right, but this was brand new in the package"
4,Good quality,This seems to be a quality tarp with no obvious visual issues and reinforced corners. I'll be putting on a pop-up tent trailer so will have to report back on how it's holding up in the weather/sun of N Calif. Will also use it as a ground cover when camping so that may add a little wear.
4,tarp review,"sturdy, good color, flexible , arrived on time, easy to apply, good price, good sizing for my needs would highly recommend the tarp"
5,I love my life,"I grew up listening to folk music,but only just recently have I started to collect my own musical library.This is the first Iris Dement album I own and I'm hooked.This cd is worth its weight in gold.I am in awe of her songwriting ability,she makes it sound so easy.This is a tiny package filled with beautiful songs and lyrics that will make you just want to stop and listen for hours on end."
1,That voice...,"I tried to like Iris, but I just don't. That voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me."
5,beautiful cd,"this cd made me an instant iris dement fan. i bought this cd a week after i heard her on the opry. i had never heard of her before then. ""sweet is the melody"" and ""no time to cry"" are absolute gems. the rest of the cd is just as good. this is a great cd."
5,Truly Wonderful,"Ms. DeMent has grown to be one of my favorite all-time artists. This album is true to life. She has an amazing talent of describing hardships, and life in a small town. I'm still coming down off the high of seeing her live on January 27."
3,A few essays make it worth buying/reading,"Danker is the greatest living Greek lexicographer. This volume includes a biography of Danker and his essay on the challenges of lexicography. The essay by John A. L. Lee was particularly interesting as he told some of the findings of his larger book on New Testament lexicography. You will also learn about the state of Septuagint lexicography, as the leading scholars in that field had contributions. The book will create an awareness of technology and its effect on Greek scholarship, related to lexicography of course. There are also some articles which touch upon pedagogy and the Greek language with a nexus of course to lexicography. A couple of the essays were very myopic and less than interesting, which is to be expected in an academic work of this sort."
4,Macabre Stories,"This anthology was published in 1963 and contains seventeen stories. They are mild by today's standards but for the most part are entertaining. In my opinion the best story is MR. GEORGE which was one of the better Boris Karloff presents THILLER episodes. Other stories of note: DEAD MAN'S SHOES, MRS. MANIFOLD, THE BLUE SPECTACLES and BISHOP'S GAMBIT."
2,Mr. Obvious,"Many points made in the book were extremely easy to see coming. If you want a book to help you to take a nap, grab this book off the shelf. It is guaranteed to cure insomnia.Coming from the Christian perspective, the author states that the Church needs to be following the inherent values of the community in which we are a part. No kidding?!Are the core values of the Christian church supposed to be any different from church to church?I gave it two stars for effort, not for content. Great author, poor content."
4,Simple,Very simply written. I ordered the Kindle version and it is easy to navigate. I have no issues with this book.
2,Disappointed,"I've purchased several Batali products and have been more than pleased. So I didn't hesitate at all when I saw the Batali name even though this seemed a bit expensive. But I challenge anyone to slice a large piece of mozzarella with this. I have to cut them into 1/2"" to 1"" thick pieces and then ""carefully"" slice them with this slicer. I use it about once a week when I make pizza and am surprised it hasn't already broken."
3,mozzarella slicer,"I purchased this recently. Used it 3 times on fresh mozzarella and one of the wires snapped. While I was happy with how it performed, I didn't expect it to break after 3 uses...."
5,"A fantastic, amazing product!!!","This product is truly amazing! It covers the entire ipod! I don't have to worry about anything getting scratched at all. I was getting maitanance on my ipod one day, and the Geek Squad member told me that the condition of my ipod was ""pristine"". He was amazed. This case, unlike many silicone cases, doesn't collect lint. The click wheel cover does a tiny little bit, but it is easy to wipe off. I think this is because of the unique texture of the silicone.I only have two things I don't like about it - it is rather bulky with the plastic clip. I can't put it in the pocket of my jeans without the ipod sticking out. However, I have heard that the clip MAY be removeable (although this may be on the newer models). Also, the case is a bit hard to put on, but it makes me feel secure about the dust protection.The color of the iSkin in the picture represents the real color very well. The case really does look like that."
2,Slow and totally predictable,"I was really looking forward to reading this book as it came highly recommended by friends and I am a fan of both historical novels and mysteries. The first half of the book can only be described as plodding. When the mystery finally came into play, there were really no clues presented only references to what progress was not being made. The ending was no surprise as it could pretty well be deduced about 2/3 of the way through. I would have given up on it about 1/3 of the way through, but I figured there must be something coming up that would be redeeming. The rest of the book was only a slight improvement."
3,"Good, Not Great!","When I learned that there was a series of Victorian era murder/mysteries I became excited since I was bored with the usual historical romances. Ah, thought I, now for some excitement. In the Cater Street Hangman, the first of this series, the plot is good as mysteries go with any number of red herrings thrown in. The final denouement is a surprise (at least it was to me). However, the characters all seem a bit shallow and story movement is slow. At the outset I thought this would be one of those books where I read the first couple of chapters and set it aside. Not so. After a slow start, the story does indeed pick up with bits and pieces of the puzzle being revealed slowly.For this reader, however, there are many unanswered questions about dangling story lines. Hopefully, they will be answered in the next book in the series. I've given this book 3 stars based on the originality of the plot."
4,Great introduction to Charlotte and Thomas,"Having been introduced to Anne Perry when my brother gave me The Twisted Root, I was eager to read more. Unable to find Face of a Stranger, the first in the Monk's series, I bought The Cater Street Hangman. I loved the way Anne Perry was able to take us inside each character's thoughts. Though, I figured out the ending, like I did in The Twisted Root also, I found her characters well worth the read. I'm eager to read more Perry books."
4,The Cater Street Hangman,Slow to begin with but good! Very well done to provide the reader with the Victorian era.
4,Victorian mystery!,"The charm of this book is in it's setting. The charming part is that Victorian England is a main character in the book. I enjoyed this book because not only are you engaged in a good mystery but you also learn about everyday life during that time period. Overall I liked the book, the character's were well rounded and at time's the mystery takes a back seat to the character's development throughout the book. I would recommend this book to those who love mysteries, and those who like historical fiction."
5,Good example of 19th century life,"Over the years, I heard such good things about Anne Perry that I decided to sit down one afternoon and browse through her first book. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. She plays well with the atmosphere of the 19th century, also describing well the cast system that was existing at the time. Oh yeah, there's also a good mystery in there. Pitt is an interesting character that I'm sure will be well developped in the next books. A good read!"
5,Eternal gratitude to A&E for introducing me to Anne Perry,"After I saw ""The Cater Street Hangman"" on A&E, I immediately rushed out to the library and devoured every Perry novel I could get my hands on. This book is enthralling, as much as a study of Victorian society as a murder mystery. Charlotte and Thomas are superbly matched and unusually compelling; Perry spares them the all too common fate of fictional detectives who are reduced to the level of thinking machines. Everything I have read by her is gripping and highly recommended."
5,What a great beginning to a series,Though Victorian times are a bit stuffy if you can get past that you will have a GREAT read. Kept me on the edge all the way to the SURPRISE ending. WOW! Can't wait to read more.
2,Rather slow,"I found this book (in audio format) to be quite slow. More then halfway thru the book I wondered when the ""mystery"" part would kick in. The murders, police, and investigation were very much in the background, and rather than spend time on the mystery I was treated to tidbit after tedious tidbit about an upper middle class lady's life in Victorian England. I personally think the greatest mystery is why so many people find this book wonderful and fascinating. If you prefer gripping and gritty even in historical mysteries, this series is not for you."
2,"Entertaining, but...","This novel is semi-entertaining. It is set in Victorian England and ""stars"" Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Ellison (the soon-to-be Mrs. Pitt). The best thing about this book is Perry's attention to the historical setting, especially in regard to class structure. However the actual mystery is lacking, and I figured out who the murderer was quite early on in the novel.The most shocking thing about this novel actually has nothing to do with the story, but rather about the author. I was very surprised to learn (after reading several more of her works), that Anne Perry is actually a murderer herself (her real name is Juliet Hulme), and was convicted when she was 15 years old of killing her friend's mother. [...] or watch the movie Heavenly Creatures. Whether justified or not, this revelation has soured me toward future Perry novels."
1,Dreadful,"A Victorian mystery? Really? Neither Victorian nor a mystery, I fear. The representation of Victorian society is appallingly inept - inaccurate and exaggerated - and the mystery could have been unravelled by a not-very-bright child. Worst of all, though, is the incompetent attempt at characterisation. The women are so poorly written that they are only distinguishable by name, and the men are heavy-handed collections of mannerisms and stock attitudes. Inauthentic tripe."
1,Writing so bad it was painful.,"The writing and storytelling in this book was so unoriginal, it read like a parody. This could have been an overacted, overdramatized skit on SNL. And if the style of writing wasn't bad enough, the villain was obvious well before reaching the halfway mark of the book."
2,Unfortunately overpriced by publisher,"I am often disappointed to find that I am not able to justify buying a novel I have very much enjoyed, like Anne Perry's mysteries, for my Kindle due to the unreasonably high prices that the publishers seem to want to inflict on the buying public. Perhaps they wish to discourage readers from using e-books, since the cost of the novels are sometimes even higher for the e-books than for the same material in a paperback. I have a library of close to a thousand books, mostly in paperback, which I eventually want to convert to the e-book versions, but I am not able to do this due to the costs. The publishers will need to get on the electronic media train, because it will, in time, either carry them into the future or run them down and crush them."
3,Victorian Serial Killer on the loose,"It took me three tries to get into this book, but once I got hooked I stayed up late and got up early to finish it. The murder mystery is unpredictable with several convincing red herrings thrown in to pull you off track. In the end, the motive behind the killer's actions are alluded to, but not strongly supported by the storyline. This made the ending slightly unsatisfying. However, the Victorian era's customs and manners is presented with picture-painting detail and seemed believable.Anne Perry uses a very interesting literary device: we can hear the thoughts of only female characters (not all of them, but we never see inside a male character's mind). This helped to focus (or even exagerate?) the emotional and social distance between the male and female characters. Enjoy the book and the character of Charlotte as she changes over the course of the series."
3,A little creepy at times.,"There's no gore or graphic violence in the book but it is a little creepy at times. I think it's more the not really knowing who did it......it could be the father, the brother in law......members of your family! You seem to be able to sense the discomfort and fear that creeps into the family affected by the murders."
4,"Not my usual type of mystery, but enjoyable","I was a bit hesitant to read this book, anticipating that it might have romance elements which I would not find interesting. It did not. This was definitely a bit lighter than my usual mystery selections, which tend to be rather dark and complex. Nonetheless, the story was reasonable. My only real criticism was that the characters seemed a bit stiff."
4,Surprisingly good!,"I have been waiting for these books to finally become available on Kindle, so was curious when I downloaded this to see if the series would be any good. I thought the beginning was a little hard to figure out who all the characters are, but as the book continued, I really liked it. I figured out who the killer was before it was revealed, but the story still kept my attention. It reads like a Sunday night PBS murder mystery show so if you like that pace, you will like this book. I'm reading the second book in the series now, but am not finding it quite as captivating."
3,A very trying read,"This book attempts to cover so many political figures from the era (1649 - 1775) with all manner of tidbits (who was the friend or relative of whom, who hung out in what club, etc) and snippets of their thoughts and writings that they and their work become almost indistinguishable. Furthermore, the author refers to both large and small events of that era with no attempt of explanation. And her consideration of people and events skips back and forth across the era adding to the confusion factor. The book fits the academic stereotype only too well: unnecessarily obscure.In short, the reader had best already have a very good knowledge of the history of the era. And a lot happened: the execution of a king, the restoration of a king, and the replacement of a king. For the very dedicated and knowledgeable reader, there may be enough understanding of Whig thinking in the book to endure a difficult read. The book is three stars only for that reader."
5,Childhood Favorite,"I'm so glad to see this gem is still in print. Before I learned to read, THIS was the book I checked out of the library repeatedly and made my family members read to me over and over again until they groaned and begged me to find another book I liked. But this colorful book and its endearing pooch captured my heart and delighted my imagination like no other book at that time. Forty years later, I can still remember it vividly. Now that I know it's available, I'm going to order a copy for myself."
4,"Well done, accessible and ultimately useful","This video is a bit different than the norm. Instead of just showing techniques and movement, it sets a relaxing mood so you don't feel that your in the middle of a classroom or having a text book flashed at you. I quite liked this approach probably, like most, because one of my primary reasons for massage was stress reduction/relaxation. It is also done in a chapter formation for each body part so you can just work on a body part. While the video is ambitious in trying to cover all the body parts, the techniques shown were more than sufficient for my use-advanced beginner/intermediate. The rest of our group, who were beginners, were also able to follow along easily.I would recommend this as a first or second step into the world of acupressure, massage or alternative health. It will not replace taking a good massage or acupressure class but it will provide the fundamentals in a very relaxing and accessable manner."
2,Synergy not always the best version,"Rainbow Valley like most other knock off prints is no better , if not worse that the Mill Creek or Platinum/ Echo Bridge copies. The story is good for early B westerms, but unfortunately quality suffers.Don't waste the extra money."
5,Best of Great Jazz Guitarist,"Klugh is truly one of the great talents of our time. Here in one CD are many of his finest ... from Brazilian Stomp to For the Love of You.This has all kinds of moods in it, from Movin' On to romantic and luscious Jo Ann's Song. It's upbeat, clear recording with excellent backup instrumentalists who perform at a high-level.Great addition to one's jazz collection."
5,I Love This CD,"For nearly a year I've had this CD on my wake-up alarm CD player, and I never get tired of waking up to it. Lots of variety, lots of instrumentation, a truly great collection."
2,If you like smooth jazz,"This is completely forgettable muzak, but it's considered top of the line by the smooth jazz community. I don't mind a little of it when I don't want my brain to be the slightest bit engaged with the music."
4,I Enjoyed the New Twist in Paranormal Romance,"This is a great book, I read it in a day and enjoyed the new twist the author has on immortal beings. This is the book to pick up when you are tired of vampires and bored of werewolves. Would definitely recommend this book for a fun summer read."
2,Forget this,Totally silly book. The plot was non existant or not worth writing. The characters were just as silly and the book has the WORSE Satan ever. A simpering stupid and very very annoying character. NO real character development and all they do is whine about their respective lack of sex lives. 5/10
2,Don't waste your money,"I really wanted to like this book. But the main character is annoying, the plot could have been good if she was a better writer, and satan talks like Puss in boots (only dumber). The second book is better, but this one could have been a complete miss for me."
4,Cute and funny.,This was a cute and very funny book but not what I was expecting. I laughed out loud a couple of times mainly due to Satan's wooing of the main character's mother. I have not read the other installments yet but I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh.
4,FUNNY!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. Cute story, great characters, well written!! I laughed out loud. Already ordered the other 3. Can't wait to get my hands on them. I'm so happy I can add Stephanie Rowe to my list of favorite authors."
4,Very funny and sarcastic stories.,"I wasn't sure what I was in for when I started reading the author's preface to this book - but once I read the first story, I understood what was going on. It is very over the top, surreal fantasy humor fiction, and it's VERY funny at times. Quick stories to read, and well worth the time!Wonderful.Reminded me a lot of Douglas Adams' style (though technically, I suppose one should say that Adams' has a Walpolish style, but I read Adams 3 decades before any Walpole, so there you have it)."
4,Highly recommended!,"I'm working in the Aerospace industry and for me there are only two books on the subject that I use for unclassified reference litterature - this book and ""Rocket Propulsion Elements"" by C. Sutton.This book covers almost everything on the preliminary design level of a rocket propulsion system. Except for the typing errors this book is perfect. And I can surely recommend it for students as well as professionals."
3,"""Un Buon punto di partenza""","Il testo analizza tutti i motori per la propulsione spaziale; a propellente liquido (bi e mono), solido, ibrido, a gas freddo, nucleare ed elettrico.Una parte è dedicata anche all'apetto della missione orbitale e per la specifica missione anche quale tipo di propulsiore impiegare.Per quando riguarda la tematica strettamente motoristica vengono presi in considerazione le problematiche di carattere progettuale senza però entrare nei particolare.Il libro si conferma così ""un buon punto di partenza"". Personalmente lo consiglio a tutti quelli che volessero ""iniziare a saperne di più"". La ""matematica"" dei calcoli NON è a livello ""universitario"", e la lettura è molto scorrevole.Un'attenzione particolare va rivolta alla bibliografia, dove vengono citati report tecnici della NASA reperibili anche in rete."
1,Worst Book,"I spent a lot of money to buy this book. However, it was badly written. Quite disappointing."
3,"Not quite as good as ""Chasing...""","I love Collide. they get better with time. Some of the songs are unforgetable and timeless. The best part of this music is that it give you the good parts of atmospheric, gothic, mood rock and electronic music all in one great packaging.This album just isn't as good as Chasing the Ghost, which is simply amazing. There are some songs that I consider not-so-good (Slither Thing, Complicated). There are also some great tracks on here (Crushed, Somewhere, So Long).All in all, it's a good album but not great. If you really enjoyed Chasing the Ghost, then you'll probably find enough on this album to warrent the $20. But if Chasing the Ghost didn't do anything for you, you should pass on this one."
4,Some Kind of Fantastic,Some Kind of Strange was an excellent album. It has a goth/vampire mood music feel to it and that is exactly what I got it for. It is a good album and I plan to get others by this group.
2,disappointed,"Certainly kARIN has such a sultry, sexy voice and appeal but here I think they focus too much on that and it all comes out like a large, undifferentiated gelatinous mish mash of unidentifiable blob washed up on a Chilean shore. Their previous albums are spotty but they at least have a few distinctive songs here and there."
1,what a waste of money!,"It's good to support the underground alternative bands and I bought this album based on many ads I saw in alternative music magazines. I have to say that a ""sensual"" voice is not enough to make great music. The singer tries to much to sound sensual sometimes its almost ridiculous but anyway, the big problem with this album are the compositions. There is no melody, all the album sounds very monotony, just a voice with no direction around very basic sounding guitars and drums. Overall there is a total lack of musicality. I wouldn't even use the album as background music, the music is very predictable, boring, unremarkable. What a waste really. It's funny, even in the underground scene a band can be over advertised. Caveat emptor."
2,Lacks depth,"I'm a big fan of Collide's ""Chasing the Ghost"" album... I hear those songs in my dreams even, magical stuff. Based upon the other reviews I bought this album hoping to be similarly entranced. I was very disappointed. The songs lack the range and depth and passion of ""Chasing the Ghost"", perhaps the mixing could have been better, but they just don't grab me. I'm afraid that Collide may count as one of the many one-album-wonders of the music world."
4,good but repetitive,"I don't like much electronic/darkwave/whatever this is music, but this group is pretty straight. Their music could be really hypnotic if the whole album didn't sound like one long song. All of the songs are played at the same tempo and really lack a whole lot of distinguishing features. I've heard some of their other stuff and might buy other albums because they sound more varied than this one. Basically, if you only listen to one or two songs at a time, this is worth having in your collection. If you like a lot of this kind of music, then you probably already have this, but if not you'll love it."
3,Did I miss something?,"I really did try to give this CD a fair chance. After reading all these reviews I ordered the disc. I played it 3 times in a week at various times of day to see if my mood may affect my decision, but it didn't.....this disc is on the goodbye pile. The instrumentation is fine and kaRIn's voice does what she will with the words, but I can't detect any melody or anything to make any song memorable. It appears that it takes more than mysteriousness and meds to make good music. The album just seems to be an amalgam of noise. Which is ironic, because the label is called NoisePlus. Appropo. Some kind of strange, indeed."
4,Decent,"The knife looks good and fits snug in my hand. The grips were made from what I assume to be a poly-based plastic and had a rubber feel to them. The blade came extra sharp and didn't have any side to side bladeplay, but some back and forth (wouldn't worry to much about it as seems fairly secure). The blade is fairly large and locks into place with nice click sound.Overrall...I'm pleased with the knife for being fairly inexpensive."
4,"Love it, bought another","Real lockback quality blade, nice weight and comfortable handle. Love the way it looks and feels, best knife for the money so far, my new everyday pocket knife"
2,Book Condition,I just received the book and it is in very poor condition; writing covers almost every page. I was under the impression the book was in good condition.
4,"Great for therapists, lacking for family members wanting to learn","I felt like this book explained DID more on a therapist level than a family member's level. It is a great book, but not what I was looking for."
5,Use caution!,"This is a fantastic, insightful guide for those who struggle with DID, and those who love them. The latter group will instantly recognize descriptions of behavior that left them puzzled, and the former may be shocked to learn that they are not the only ones who feel totally alien to this world. Approach this book with good caution ; it may be triggering."
3,For Women Only,"This book has a lot of helpful information for females who have been diagnosed with DID or who think they might have DID, and their therapists. The author completely dismisses men as sufferers of DID. If you are male or you are concerned about men, you must look elsewhere. There is some information here that may be of help to you, but it isn't worth the price of the book."
2,"Enjoyed the tour, but.......","Although an interesting view on Rosslyn Chapel, it is very poorly written and even more poorly edited. I enjoyed the history and the 'tour' of the chapel, but the majority of the author's thoughts were incomplete and disorganized. There are several chapters that have paragraphs that are repeated and others that appear to never have been edited, making for a difficult read."
1,Hearsy to disprove hearsay,"The author of this iconoclastic text claims that the Sinclair legacy in Scotland is based on hearsay and then he proceeds to use hearsay to try and disprove it. I bought the book to learn about the Sinclairs and Rosslyn and came away knowing not what they are, but what they aren't."
1,Disappointing,"Having read some of Philip Coppens' web articles, this book was a major let-down. I didn't particularly feel that any ""truth"" was revealed, or even anything remotely interesting or original. It reads more of as a smokescreen than anything else. Et tu Mr Coppens?"
5,Loads of Fun!,"We got this game for our son, 5-1/2, who is really into Legos. This has been a great game for him - it's easy to understand the rules, he gets to lay out the track, the game doesn't take too long to play, and he can rebuild the cars as much as he likes. We are enjoying this game tremendously! A bonus is that he can build a track himself and play with the cars without playing the game, so it has turned into a very good rainy day activity for him."
5,excellent product,"This is Great Stuff! It feels good, it smells good, it works! Using only once a day, my skin is smoother and tighter, my laugh lines are much less pronounced, and my skin tone is much more even. It doesn't leave my skin thin and paper-y around the eyes like many women's products do. I do wash above and immediately below my eyes with this product without any adverse effects on my contacts. It is worth every penny. The only downside is the packaging doesn't allow for much control when pouring the product into your hand, so you have to be careful not to get more than you need. Excellent Product."
4,"Feels great, but no pump","It actually feels great, gives your face a minty feel, and tastes somewhat alcoholic. The problem for this item is that it doesn't have a pump or even a squeeze opening. I believe it's meant for those who already own one with a pump to replace with, so if you aren't buying two to get the free shipping from this seller then you might be better off buying the one from Macy's that has a pump at least according to the picture for the same price and 4.95 shipping I believe. I've only used this product once so far, but it feels great. The reason I'm not giving 5 full stars is 1) no pump 2) in metal can which worries me because of all the talk about how Alzheimer's is affected by your body's absorption of aluminum and 3) only comes in 8oz cans, does not offer 16oz cans to reduce cost per oz."
1,gelatinous cleaner; bottle design flawed,"Ordered this product online and will never buy it again. The cleaner is effective but its texture is gelatinous and very thick; so I have to shake the bottle for a long time for it to even come out. The bottle design is terrible: no way to pump the cleaner into your hands or squeeze it. Sure, it looks pretty, but that's it."
5,Awesome Product,"I started using Zirh Clean when it was recommended to me by a C.O. Bigelow employee back in 2009. I have continued to use it daily since then. It's hard to find where I live, so I usually buy it when I see it while out of town. I decided to look on Amazon & found it for a great price, so I purchased multiples to keep in stock. My skin is pretty oily and this seems to help control it, but not dry it out. I actually use it on my chest, shoulders & back in the shower as well. Great product, I would recommend very highly to any guys that care about their skin!"
4,Great product in a poor container,"I love the actual product. It makes your face very clean and smooth and does not dry your skin like other, harsher, products. It clear our pores and makes your skin look brighter. This particular product is in an aluminum/steel can which is not very convenient, and that is my only gripe. It does come in tubes which are a lot nicer and I would recommend looking for them.The company, as of recently, seems to be in a flux and possibly going out of business. Their products are disappearing from many stores. I emailed the company and they said they are buying the product line back from P&G; and will be reintroducing it to stores and online very soon. Hopefully this is true and it doesnt take too much time."
4,"Great product, has worked very good for me in the past 3 months","I've always looked for good products for my face and decided to try the Zirh face wash.It's been great since I started using it. I apply it once a day, mostly in the morning before I go to work and my face stays oil free. I use it with Zirh clay mask (this I use once or twice a week) which is very good too. The only problem I see is that the bottle, even though ir pretty cool, won't let you take all the face wash out when its almost gone. The solution I've come up with is that, when my face wash is almost gone, I'll put a bit of water on the bottle so I can use all the face wash.Overall, great product and would recommend it.Peace out!"
5,Invigorating clean,"After washing my face with Zirh Clean, it feels invigorated and smooth. I enjoy washing my face twice a day with this product. And am looking forward to using it for a long time to come."
3,Good cleanser- a little rough on my sensitive skin,Good smell and works good but yes the bottle design sucks when you're in the shower and the smooth aluminum bottle is wet. It is a little too rough on my face though and sometimes leaves it feeling a tight. I prefer billy jealousy exfoliating face scrub which works great for everyday use- and I've tried them all!
2,Older style packaging,Older style packaging gives me impression that it's overstock and not latest/newest/freshest product as found in higher end stores. 2-3 stars.
1,"Awful, waste of money","The smell is a bit...medicinal.The product itself doesnt clean at all, my skin has never looked worse. Save the money and stick to Neutrogena"
3,Hard to get out of the bottle,"While the wash itself seems to work very well, I have to knock stars for the consistency and the bottle. The bottle is aluminum and I dropped it once in the shower to find it put a gash in the tub! Be careful, if it falls spout facing down, it can cause some damage.Someone previously mentioned the gelatinous texture and they are dead on. When the stuff is not heated up, it is very solid stuff and takes nearly a minute for anything to start oozing out of the bottle. To get the stuff to come out a little better, I now put the bottle on the shower floor so the water can heat up the bottle to get the stuff to flow out a little better."
2,Not too bad,"Clean by Zirh is not a bad product. However, after using it for 2-3 weeks, some rashes appeared on my face. I discontinued its use and after a while decided to get back to it, with the same odd results.I really believe it can be helpfull for some people, maybe those ones that have oily skin, but definetly not for me."
5,Well Written and Useful,"""This well written text provides a clear, uncluttered overview of the principles and practice of modern light microscopy. It contains many helpful teaching exercises and diagrams. It should prove useful in a wide range of courses from the undergraduate to the postgraduate level.""-- Kenneth R. Spring, Ph.D., Author"
3,"Almost a ""4"" but loses its way the last 60 pages","Terrific writing and characters but somehow, this book got away from the author. It's not ""really"" a ghost story -- there is some ghost-stuff but it's really about choices made and divorce and re-marriage and relationships.When the characters are focused on, it's just terrific -- there really is no need for the ghost stuff; it could have been an excellent novel about a new blended family. Phil is the husband and Michelle is his new wife. They are really in love and yet by the last 60 pages, they are fighting, separating, regreting they met, etc. And there are two or three climaxes -- an exorcism (really...? Yeah), the disappearance/almost death of a child, and a final encounter with a ghost...and it all just crumbles.But for about 300 pages of the 360 pages, it's a great read. There's a better story in here--and you'll find it--but it's a bit distracting with the ex-husband ghost stuff."
4,covers,I bought these cover for our camper and They seem well made. The big one is bigger than I expected but It will be great for the larger platters. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this product
5,PR Gourmet Pop Up Food Covers,Excellent use at picnics to keep flies out of food. Should have purchased more of them. Received on time and in excellent packaging.
3,Nice food cover but insects can enter from bottom,It is a very well designed product for covering food but not very well made.There should be hanging cloth/mesh at the bottom. It does not hug the surface and there is room for insects to enter.
5,A must have for outdoor picnics,"Nothing disgusts me more than flies landing on the food that I am about to eat. These work great for keeping the critters away. I also like that they are totally vertical on the sides, because they do not touch the food in the bowls."
4,Pop Ups were well made.,"These came in handy to protect food items. However, it would be nice if one of them came in a taller size to accommodate baby bottle drying racks."
5,FOOD COVERS ARE GREAT!,"These food covers are really great. They are perfect for BAR BQ's, and can be used to cover a cake in the kitchen! Very versatile! Easy to store since they fold flat. Three different sizes.....none too small to actually be usable. The price is very affordable considering you get 3 in this deal. I'm very pleased and you most likely will be, too."
5,Very handy covers,These work well to keep insects off food sitting out. This our second set because the first got dirty after some years of use. The elastic used to keep them flat for storage does stretch out in time but I have no other complaints.
3,"Cute, but painful","These shoes are adorable; I've gotten complements on them from strangers on the street. And the Amazon price was a steal! Plus, they're made in Italy, really quality goods! Unfortunately, they are the most painful shoes I have ever worn. Maybe it's because my feet run wide, but I cannot make these beauties work. I have to take mincing little steps like a geisha to keep them on, and I get blisters through my hose. I'll probably keep inflicting them on my feet, because I'm a masochist when it comes to cute shoes, but if you have wide feet, you might want to avoid these."
2,How NOT to put together a compilation,"The Sugarcubes were one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Its a shame their legacy is reduced to a lame one-disc sampler cd, with no rare tracks. And many of their best songs are conspicuously absent. 'Speed is the Key', 'A Day Called Zero', 'Dream TV', 'Delicious Demon', 'Leash Called Love' and 'I'm Hungry' aren't even on there. And those are my all-time favorite Sugarcubes songs!I strongly recommend that anyone interested in The Sugarcubes skip this lame compilation and instead get the original excellent Sugarcubes albums LIFE'S TOO GOOD, HERE TODAY TOMORROW NEXT WEEK, and STICK AROUND FOR JOY."
5,Great Title Album For A Great Crossover Band,"I love the Sugarcubes! I think this is a pretty descent intro for those who aren't familiar with the Sugarcubes, or with the other great hits they had from the other 3 albums they had after ""Life's Too Good."" The only criticism i have for this album is that they could have at least done more tribute to the band, who pretty much were the FIRST band from Iceland to go international...thats a pretty big leap for Iceland whose still culturally growing and trying to create an image of the Icelandic experience. They could have had a least one picture, and a more coherent biography of the Sugarcube's history together. But the things that lack don't exceed the album itself. It's still an awesome collection that every serious Bjork fan should have."
2,"I can't get past ""him""","I gave the Sugarcubes a casual try in college, but was strongly put off by them. It's a shame, really: the songs are well-written, great to dance to, and Bjork has one of the most beautiful voices in rock, even when she's screaming or out of tune. My problem is with that clown Einar Orn Benediktsson, the Icelandic equivalent of Fred Schneider, who contributes nothing to this band except the spouting of nonsensical interjections which detract from the songs. Why the group let this guy near the microphone is beyond me.THEREFORE, if you're a fan of Bjork's solo stuff, like me, be cautious when trying any Sugarcubes material. Of course, Einar doesn't taint every song they've done, but when he does, it can be a painful experience. Even this collection of their best songs can't help hide that fact. If they could find a way to erase his voice from the tracks, THEN I'd be interested."
3,Just a greatest hits album,"This isn't a bad compilation, but it could be a bit more varied, this is just a good, simple greatest hits compilation. Still very enjoyable.Also, i quite like Einar! :)"
2,This thing is bigger than you think it is,If you were going with something this large I would recommend a backpack with permanent rollers. This thing is huge and would be unwieldy dragging through the airport. I sent it back.
5,Effective transporter...,"Fits into suitably equipped Kata bags (with straps across the back) to make a heavy shoulder bag or backpack an instant rolling bag, with an expanding/collapsing handle, like that of a rolling suitcase. Also, the width of the outer wheel set can be expanded or pushed back in. High quality, and worth the price if you have heavy gear bags. I use it for both a Kata pack bag and the large shoulder bag."
4,Back Saver,"Using the Kata Insertrolley is a real back saver. I imagine it would also be great for photographers that suffer from arthritis, muscle, and joint pain as well. I use it to cart my gear around the city, which can get pretty heavy sometimes. Though I doubt it would be practical for trails / hiking and other such related activity. I had a back injury from a horseback riding accident that comes back to haunt me on occasion, so I have to be cautious about how much weight I carry in my camera bags, and that was restrictive. The Insertrolley was the answer!I use both Messenger and Backpack type camera bags with the Insertrolley, and they are both easily accessible while on the trolley. It has made my total photographic experience much more gratifying.I've only had it a short time, hence only the 4 star rating."
4,"Awesome, but...","Works great is solid like other KATA products ! jus one thing dosent fit @ airplane, unless you detach your bag...."
4,CRP,I really like this book; it's very informative...the type of info I was looking to get on the subject. It gives what you should look for in your own tests and who should be tested.
4,battery extender,"works excellent with both my archos portable dvr and my lg phone: however, it does not function as a battery charger."
2,rather weak debut,"I liked the group and the two singles...but was disappointed with this album. Too pop-ish, too weak songs and a very weak production. Releasing a Jackson 5 cover-version as a third single probably did the rest."
2,Not Very Impressed,"One of the girls, who happens to be the main singer on a lot of the tracks, sounds like a young Michael Jackson. The band even does a Jackson Five song so they must realize the truth of this. Aside from 2 of the slower songs, this whole CD is very annoying."
2,Fun flies when you're doing time...,"It's funny, that I remember Cleopatra being on the Disney channel a LOT when I was younger. And I remember at that point that I did like the song ""Cleopatra's Theme"" and some of the other songs they played on Disney. Recently I remember them so looked up the song and checked it out on Youtube. And it is not NEARLY as good as I remembered it. They are three little girls... I seem to remember them being mature women, but I guess my young age at the time distorted it. Anyway, the vocals are week and the songs are cheesy and not nearly as catchy as I remember them being."
4,Comin Atcha,"This album is a refreshing change to all of the manufactured bands that are around at the moment. Comin Atcha contains the hit singles Cleopatras Theme, Life Aint Easy, I Want You Back and a Touch Of Love. This album is all about fun and thats what you will have if you buy this album and permenantly leave it in your stereo"
5,One of the Best Movies of All Time,"This is one of the best movies of all time. I don't know what the film academics have to say about it, but in my view it rivals anything Kurosawa ever did. But even that does not say it. It is as good if not better than anything in American cinema to date. I'm not kidding. It's that good."
4,Pay attention to connecter gender!,"I'd just like to warn anyone that might make the same mistake I did.I bought this without paying much attention to the type of IDE connector on it. When I tried to connect it I realized I should have gotten one with a male IDE connector (the kind that is on every normal IDE drive). You cannot plug a standard IDE cable into this drive.However, if you have room in your case for it, it is possible to plug this directly into your motherboard. The disadvantage of this is that you will not be able to share this port with a secondary drive.I can't comment on the performance of this adapter since I was not able to connect it for my application."
4,Great stuff!,This is great lubricant for all those fine instruments laying about the house. I collect pocket knives and use it to get into the movable parts. The precise needle applicators are great for getting into those tiny locations.
5,great product,fits my spalding hoop perfectly. good deal. easy to install and got here fast. its seems very durable and would buy again.
1,don't buy this toaster!,"I bought this toaster hoping to finally get some properly browned toast - it was so slow that the toast came out hard and dry when it finally turned brown. I sent it back for repair, it was initially refused - they claimed it was an old model and they didn't have parts - after I gave them lots of documentation, they sent me a ""new"" toaster. It was identical to the one I sent back including its inability to make decent toast!"
4,Best of the WDT Books,A Deed of Death is the best of the 3 main William Desmond Taylor books which have been written - the fictional A Cast of Killers and the case study volume William Desmond Taylor: A Dossier - being the other two.I recommend anyone interested in WD Taylor to have all 3 of these books in their personal library.
5,This novel is about Joan of Arc as a young girl.,"This novel is about Joan of Arc, and what her life might have been like before and during her heroic battle. It is written from her point of view, and is very realistic, and at the same time not so. It really changed the way I think of things, and I think you would like it, if you are interested by now. This book tells about who might have been her friends, how her farm may have been, and everything else about what her life may have been like. In fact, there were only two things that were different about her were 1) Her love for God and 2)Her saints. So, I think this book is one for someone who likes to think about what they read."
2,no packaging,"I purchased 3 of these. These pencils were sent to me loose in a thin envelope.... no packaging as shown in the picture... it was supposed to a gift for my son's stocking... As expensive as they are, I expected more."
2,Disappointed,Pencil kept breaking each time I tried to sharpen it....threw it away after half the pencil broke away.My advice to others thinking of buying it and having it shipped to you is to find a local stationery shop that stocks it and buy it there.
1,Like toxic waste to my brain....,"I had high hopes for this book, expecting it to be a neutral textbook, but sadly the authors views shined through like a nuclear bomb. After just a few pages, all the talk of positive effects of nuclear energy and radiation made me ill... This book has nothing to do with medicine or health. This is, in my opinion, a highly political book. Pro-nuclear energy all the way. As a medical student hoping for a career in radiology as well as a Medical Peace Work student, I say stay away. I will be deleting this Kindle eBook in protest."
2,Suspenseful but depressing,"The premise of this book was interesting and the story was fairly well written, however I found the latter part of the story extremely depressing."
3,"Fine against a wall, useless in a strip.","I should have looked at the reviews more closely. The plugs work beautifully if you're looking to reduce the space needed for a traditional three-prong plug in a wall outlet. If that's all you need, you're set.On the other hand, I was hoping for something I could use in wall outlets, and to plug in wall-wort plugs on my UPS. Unfortunately, these plugs have an offset that goes sharply to the right, which is fairly inflexible, and blocks adjacent plugs.There's no functional reason for the offset, so it's really disappointing."
2,Liberator idea is great,The Liberator idea for plugs is great however the design for this plug takes two spaces defeating its purpose. I have others with the straight in plug and they work very well.Cb
3,Disappointed,"My disappointment stems from the actual cable length.This does measure 18 inches in total length- from tip to tip. The actual cable length is only 13.5 inches. The connectors on both ends measure 2.25"" which all adds up to 18 inches.I was not expecting that measurement, and I don't think this was stated anywhere in the product description. I might have assumed too much.As such, I will need to return as this does not suit my needs.[Purchase Price 17.67]"
4,"Really great for tight spaces, which it were a bit longer though and less pricey.",Quality and usefulness is great. Im giving it only 4 stars though because they are a bit pricey and could be a bit longer.
5,perfect,"Worked perfectly for pulling that powerstrip out from behind the couch and the dresser, so the furniture is flush against the wall and the plug isn't rendered useless. Very flat head, grounded extension."
5,These are so handy!,"Yeah, it's just a simple thing but they are well made with heavy cords. The flat plug is really flat - the first ones we bought weren't flat enough. While we only needed two, I figured the extras would come in handy - and they have for various locations around the home."
4,Great idea....kind of small cord,"Great idea, works great with low amp devices...I found the cord diameter slightly small for my taste. They should have used or offered different gauge wire for this item. This will work great for computers or office equipment, just don't use this to plug your air compressor in behind your freezer in your garage...."
2,Sent the wrong product which was mislabeled,"I did not order, but did receive a sack of 5Ziotek ZT1212518 Power Strip Liberator Plus with Pass Through, 5-Packwhich are anything but flat. The Bag has listed in three different places what it is, with clear descriptions. Yet someone placed a barcode sticker for theZiotek ZT1212590 Power Strip Liberator Flat 18-Inch, 5-Packover the barcode on said bag. I realize that accidents happen, but wake up folks even if you did not read the bag, the bag was clear you could see that what you were shipping was wrong. Now I will hang on to these and use them for something else as they are a good product. But when I reorder, it will be with someone else."
4,Information we could use!,"We develop web sites for corporate training and reference. This book contained sound, relevant information we can put to use immediately. Virtually every section applied to the project we currently have going and is going to help us make it better and more usable. We have purchased many ""how to"" books for web design - this is undoubtedly the best"
1,For absolute beginners only,"I was extremely dissapointed after reading all the wonderful reviews of this book, to find out that all it includes is a brief synsopsis of html and web features. I am a web page developer and was hoping to sharpen some of my skills, however all this book did is waste my money. If you already know html and how to put together a web page, DON'T buy this book. It may be ok for an absolute beginner, but I'm not willing to waste my time reading it to find out."
1,Colorful but empty on content,"Totally empty on content, mostly promotional material . Similar level to X-Ray, free magazine mailed to all registered users of Quark XPress. Get Designing Killer Web Sites if you were attracted to the title of this book."
5,An up to the minute all encompassing guide to web design,"Better than the first edition ( which was great), everything has been updated with the latest developments, information and relevant illustrations. Designers are faced with the task of designing fluidly (being accustomed to traditional media) in a medium that has many restrictions, and this book is the most up to date, concise and inspirational source out there right now. There are plenty of illustations / pictures to see how other real designers have combined their vision and technical expertise to create what has to be termed an exemplary marriage of form/ function. All of the key concepts are clearly and concisely presented as that is the specialty of the books' designers. This is the book to get right now."
2,Beautiful design but lack in content,"Yes, the pictures are beautiful, and yes the layouts are good. But um...Darcy Dinucci, you forgot this is a ""book"", not a photo album."
1,Not as ordered,This was a used book but it did not come with the CD as stated had to retuned the book
2,Aptly named punk pop for the middle schoolers,"This was another album I loved in middle school. MTV loved it, Rolling Stone loved it, so I bought it. It's catchy pop music. Sorry, but it's not punk music. Not even close. This is fun pop music but nothing particularly insightful or ground breaking and will not stand the test of time."
3,It's not Nimrod,Great choice to start you off enjoying Green Day but if you really want an outstanding effort check out Nimrod. It's their best to date.
3,Good Debut for Green Day,"OK, I know they had 2 albums out before ""Dookie,"" but when it all comes down to it, Green Day first hit the big time with this album. I give it 3 stars not because it was in any way mediocre, but because its not a CD that I can just put in the player and listen to all the way through, there are a few tracks I'd rather skip. This is not so with ""Nimrod,"" their latest, which came out a few years ago.Nonetheless, ""Dookie"" was a great album. Six years after its release I still love listening to ""Basket Case,"" ""When I Come Around,"" ""Pulling Teeth,"" ""Longview,"" and ""Welcome To Paradise."" Every now and then I still hear ""WICA"" on the radio. This is the staying power ""Dookie"" has.If you're new to Green Day, I suggest picking up ""Dookie"" first before going on to ""Insomniac"" or ""Nimrod."" It will give you a good feel of the punk style of Green Day and let you fully realize whether you like the music or not."
4,dookie=perfection,you canna fault this album really like i said its perfection. Pure class in a glass!
5,One of the best albums I've ever seen,"I think that Dookie has to be one of the best CDs ever made. Songs like Longview, Basketcase, When I Come Around, Welcome to Paradise, and basically every other one still keeps me listening to this, even 4 years later."
5,We Cleaned our whole House in 15 min. listening to GREENDAY,"Greenday is good old radical rock-n-roll with some talented young musicians, we cleaned our whole house is 15 minutes! Music like this keeps this grandma in shape!"
2,"Well, it is a 2 and a HALF (don't kill me !!!)","To be honest, I loved ""Dookie"" at the first time I heard the CD, I thought it was a reasonable album at the second time, and at the third time I heard it I thought ""I'm tired of it"". How can this be? Well, I didn't like Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" the first time I heard it, thought it was monotonous (!), and now I LOVE IT . ""Dookie"" has a very great power, it is a strong album with lots of energy, but then things start to fall a bit, the songs sound too much alike, the music itself is easy and a little bit cheap, and yes it is really punk. Don't expect me to rate higher than 2 1/2 since Green Day doesn't bring nothing that makes us forget bands like The Misfits or the great Dead Kennedy's just to mention a few. ""Dookie"" isn't a bad album, but it isn't very good too, so please if you want some real power, go search for ""Offspring"" works..."
5,Pop-Punk Classic!!! One of the Best Albums of All Time!!!!!,"This album is incredible from start to finish. A must buy! Every song is worth hearing and rocks really hard. Best Green Day album EVER!!!! You won't be dissapointed. Great bass lines, incredible guitar solos, and insane drum fills. The lyrics are so meaningful and are sung great by Billie Joe. This album has great messages through out and sounds great every time it's heard. YEAH GREEN DAY!!!!"
4,This was an impressive album,"The best song on this cd in my opinion was ""Basket Case"" I just can't get enough of it! It's a great album and I highly recommend it. If you like this one you'll probably like just about any other Green Day album. I recently perchased Nimrod and Warning. Hope this helped!"
3,HELL YEAH!,"BACK WHEN DISCO WAS ON THE RIZE AND HAIR BANDS WERE THE NORM, MY ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS THE SEX PISTOLS, RAMONE'S ETC. PUNK WAS A SLAP THAT ROCK NEEDED DESPERATELY. IN 1994, I PICKED UP GREEN DAY'S ""DOOKIE."" I WAS VERY IMPRESSED, BUT TO BE HONEST, DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD MAKE IT WITH THEIR PUNK ROOTS. NEVERTHELESS, THEY PROVED ME WRONG. I MUST SAY, MY FAVORITE IS ""BASKET CASE."" THE DRUMMING BRINGS BACK MEMMORIES OF KEITH MOON IN HIS HEYDAY. WHEN MY DAUGHTER LEAVES FOR SCHOOL, I SNEEK OUT HER GREEN DAY. TOO OLD? WHO CARES!"
5,Green Day Rocks!,"I have to say this is the best punk CD ever. I think this CD is VERY GOOD. It is pure cali-punk. If you like Green Day, you'll love this CD"
5,Classic!,"Well, I read a message from someone who said that Green Day is the worst band to ever walk the earth. I was like, O-kay! Their album Dookie is a classic. I made my older sister buy it for me when I was in third grade. It's timeless. My favorite is ""When I Come Around"". Buy it. (Isomniac + Nimrod are cool too. I don't know about the older ones.) Plus, this was one of Rolling Stones' Essential Nineties Albums."
5,...Dook the Jook...,"...Dookie was the album that made Green Day one of the first mainstream punk bands and eventually paved the way for punk sellouts like Blink 182 and the Offspring.Dookie is probably one of Green Day's brightests achievements and undoubtly their first commerical success. Pop-punk classics like 'Basket Case' and 'When i come around' are Dookie's big singles.But this record is just packed with essential and quality punk tunes, from beginning to end. Noteable are 'Welcome to Paradise,' 'Having A blast,' 'In the End,' etc.Highly recommend for any punk or mainstream alt fan...."
2,empty,"Why do people like Green Day? After purchasing American Idiot and this album, it's been confirmed that Green Day has no substance in their music. All they've got are ""one-hit wonder"" songs which make you bob your head for about a week before you get bored and take it out of your cd player. Billie Joe Armstrong knows how to capture his listeners with quick beats and strong lyrics that apply to everyday audience, but he just doesn't know how to hold them.I got American Idiot and Dookie after hearing that Weezer's top influence was Green Day, but was greatly disappointed by their lack of substance. ""Longview"" is the only song worth mentioning on this album."
1,what!?,"What is this man, this sucks. I bought this cd, because I saw lots of positive reviews. I trusted the reviews that are written here, but I should not have done that. I like rock, but not this. All these songs are the same. The guitarist keeps playing the same melodies, I hate this music. Don't buy this, and don't believe the positive reviews!"
2,Please.....make it stop.....I want to end it all.......,"I heard ""When I Come Around"" on the radio and thought it was great. So I bought the album it was on. I should have given the 10 bucks to the Salvation Army. In fact, every time I consider buying a Green Day album, I give the money to charity instead. Seriously. Absolutely every single song on Dookie sounds EXACTLY the same. It took all my willpower to listen all the way through this darwin-awful album before giving it away. ""When I Come Around"" is an excellent song, but the rest is .... I hate to resort to insults, but it really is that bad. The people who gave it five, four, or even three stars must be stuck in 1994 when it was cool to like Green Day. Track 10 is proof that even the most talentless band can make a good song, but that doesn't make Dookie worth anything more than it's namesake. It would get one star, but track 10 brings it out of the abyss into the two-star level."
1,Um excuse me! This is not a good album!,"First of all I'm going to get a lot of negative feedback but this album is extremely overrated and it gave birth to one of the worst genres on earth, punk-pop! You hear a lot of people praising Green Day by saying, ""BILLIE JOE IZ SUH A GOOD MUESICIAN!!! TRE COOL IZ A BETTA DRUMMAR DAN LARS ULRICH!!!"" Enough already! Billie Joe Armstrong was an annoying vocalist(still is now) and his guitar work was 3 chords at best. His solos were sloppy too. Tre Cool was a mediocre drummer. He just wasn't original. And Mike Dirnt, you couldn't even hear that freaking bass! People praise this album saying that it saved punk. WRONG!!! It only made it worse and couldn't compare to The Ramones or The Misfits(Danzig). So in conclusion this is a very overrated album that should be avoided!"
4,Recalling Punk Music,"Green Day managed to lure millions of people into purchasing this CD, but they did it the old fashioned way - hooks aplenty. There may be more ""true"" punk bands, but they probably didn't record anything as catchy as ""When I Come Around"" or ""She"". A very good selection of material - plus it's not over-long so you don't get sick of it. You probably already have this, or you don't want it...so why are you reading this again?"
1,Worst punk rock album in the world,"this has got to be the worst albumin the world. from lame chord progressions (even worsethan the usual 3 chord progression) to even more immaturelyrics (Chump, pulling teeth, she, F.O.D) that makesno absolute sense and have no meaning and almostzero melodies, this album has made me very disappointed.the songs sound the same! dont buy it damn it"
1,LOSERS,I think y'all should flip hamburgers for a living instead of writing crappy phony commercial punk rock for retards. Who are we kidding here?
1,"Laugh at Johanson. He thinks Green Day were the first ""Punk"" band to sign with a major","The reviewer below is why the music of Green Day should be abolished. It rots its listeners' brains. Green Day is not Punk, first of all, and secondly, even if they were, they still wouldn't be the first to record on a major label. There were plenty of ""Punk"" (actually, it all sounds more like Pop to me, and charted as such) bands that were on majors. The Sex Pistols were with EMI (a division of Warner Brothers), and The Clash were on a major as well. Hell, even Black Flag got on a major before Green Day."
1,F*** THIS ALBUM!!!!,"IT BLOWS!!! NO TALENT WHAT-SO-EVER!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!! WITH BILLY JOE SCREAMING THE WHOLE TIME AND TREY COOL AND THE OTHER FAG'S NAME JUST WRECKING THEIR INSTRUMENTS, THIS IS THE WORST BAND TO EVER WALK THIS EARTH!!!!!"
4,this is punk rock,"so, yeah.....this is a punk album...a few people tried to say that green day wasnt punk, and somebody on here said that punk was all about hating hippies. where the hell did you get that from? punk no longer means rough bullying redneck trailer trash, and hasnt for quite some time, but I suppose that redneck trailer trash would hate hippies. yeah, so if you still think that, your trailer trash or a poser...take your pick....theirs to many bloody posers nowadays to, thinking green day isnt punk, ha, green day, after nirvana, practically started punk, so what the hell? this is punk rock...."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM WHICH CONTAINS 3 GOOD SONGS LIKE LONGVIEW,WELCOME TO PARADISE, AND WHEN I COME AROUND. RECOMMENDED ALONGWITH AMERICAN IDIOT, NIMROD, AND WARNING.EXPRESSO LOVE."
4,"It may be Great, but American Idiot is better....","It's not true for Green Day that they started great and got worse, they started great and got better. This is a good album, but the music simpley cannot compare to the genius of American Idiot."
5,ABSOLUTELY THE MOST CATCHY CD EVER PUT OUT,"this album does not even need explaining. AWESOME, CATCHY, RELATE, ROCKS"
4,it's okay,"i really liked this cd, but some of the songs do get repetitive ( not that i mind, i'm the only person i no who can listen to the old ending theme for Inu-Yasha 20 times and not complain ) and some of my favorite songs on this track are:1. Having a Blast. this is a very good but strange song about a suicide bomber.2.Longview. one of the most original* songs on the cd.3.Sassafrass Roots. I no everyone hates this song. that's why i love it.4. Coming Clean. Really good beat and lyrics.5. In the End. I don't no why this is my favorite song. it just is.6. F.O.D. really good song. my friend can't stand the beginning and i couldn't either when i first got the cd.All in all, this is a really good cd. i mostly listen to this and blink 182 (the good old cds) if you like greenday, also check out sum 41, white stripes, weezer, and the strokes."
3,"good CD, grows on you","I bought it for ""when I come around"" but found the rest to be pretty good, too -especially ""pulling teeth."" This CD takes a while to get used to, but then is great. Pretty good lyrics, all done in good fun."
4,"do you have the time, to listen to me whine?","Dookie is, in one word, awesome. The only reason i didnt put 5 stars on the score, is because its not the BEST green day cd. The songs that i like most are ""Longview"", ""Basket case"" and ""When i come around"". A must-have cd for any punk-rock fan though not better than Nimrod or Insomniac, but different and very original."
3,OVERRATED,"I was reading my old review, which remains intact below, and I discovered it was a bit harsh. I really do like this album, but it isn't my favorite and I think you would be better off buying 1039/smooth, Kerplunk, or Insomniac as those are my favorites.I'm also changing my star rating from 1 to 3First review:This is the most overrated Green Day album. Personally I think it is horrible. It has very very few good pieces of music.The only tracks worth listening to are Long View and Welcome to Paradise.I can't pinpoint what is it about this album, but I just don't like it and I rarely listen to. If you want a good Green Day CD I suggest buying 1039/smooth or Kerplunk, but not Dookie."
5,Green Day ROCKS!!,"(...)I got this cd (Dookie) (...)in 1994 when the album was first released. I still have it and I listen to every chance I get . All of the songs on the Dookie cd are ""AWSOME"". I have to say, every cd that I buy I always skip though songs and always find songs that I don't really like. But this I say sincerely, I have never skiped though any songs on this cd and I never will.I love every single one of them, I just can't pick a favorite. So if you like punk music this is the one you need in your cd collection, and you will never take out of cd player. Sincerley Yours, Amy (...)"
4,"Good, but not their best","Dookie is a great CD, but Nimrod is much better. Also, some songs sound the same, but they'll still get stuck in your head for days.If you are new to Green Day, get Nimrod instead, and if you like that get this."
3,Im a huge Green Day fan but can't listen to this album,"Okay, so, i know you are mad at me, but i am sooooooo tired of people saying this is the best Green Day album. Give me a break, all the songs sound the same. Now, i have all 5 green day albums so you cant say im a green day basher, i just dislike this cd. Their best two are Nimrod, and Kerplunk. Other bands i enjoy are Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Hole, and Lit."
4,u.s.,i dont know that much about green day but im glad that they have a u.s. version that seems like the fun of owning a copy
4,90's Punk Revolution?,"At the time, Green Day was as pop as punk could get without sounding like a bunch of poseurs. And to some people, Green Day did sound poseurish. However, this album (Dookie) made punk -- well, pop. The album itself is a collection of two and three minute tracks full of teenage agnst and somewhat comical representations of suburbia (though, on the surface, it seems like a fun little album with the complexity of a bowl of fruity pebbles). If I were to reccomend anyone to purchase just one Green Day album, it would be this one."
3,A pop (punk) classic,"Considered by many to be Green Day's debut, more dedicated fans of punk will ofcourse know of the two albums on Lookout. Dookie was however the album that steered Green Day towards mainstream acceptance and success. Though dismissed by most punk fans, this isn't actually bad album, the usual MTV fare of 'Basketcase' and 'When I Come Around' are there but there are true gems like 'Pulling Teeth' and 'Coming Clean'. A worthy buy for anyone who is looking for some nice poppy punk or is testing the waters to see if this punk thing is for them."
1,this band is as punk rock as a little pink dress-stay away at all costs! and hope that this pop trend will just end,"rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
1,"yes, they did sell out","Firstly, I would like to state that this is the album that killed 'Alternative Rock', and made it into the hybrid 'Alternapop' that it is today. Green Day is a sellout, and not because they signed with Columbia. I don't think that Bad Religion sold out when they went onto a major label, because they still sounded the same afterwards. The Offspring are debateable. Green Day is a sellout because they totally changed their style when they signed with a major label. Where did that fake English accent come from? I heard their early stuff, and it wasn't like this. Anyway, the album is probably deserving of 3 stars, but I hate it for what it did: prostitute an honest, 'underground' sound and dumb it down for the unwashed masses."
1,this isn't good,"This is the most easy way to make money with music. Simple people like it and buy it! Do you people really think that greenday even tries to make good music? NO! They are just doing it for the money, and it works. If you are simple, then this album is something for you. Simple music for simple people!"
1,This is the most annoying cd I've ever heard.,What a bunch of queens! Green Day sounds like the Beach Boys
4,Dookie...,Dookie is one of the best Green Day CD's ever made! My favorite songs on it are: Basket Case and F.O.D. GET THIS NOW!!!
3,well...,"strange,punks is supposed to be fast moving yet somehow half the songs on this album seem to quite dull, such as pulling teeth.but fortunatly burnout,she and the sublime basket case safe this album from being the dullest punk album ever"
1,Dookie ~ Green Day,"I don't understand all these positive reviews here. All the songs are lookalikes! Almost every song has the same tempo, guitar rif, and the singing ain't so good either. The only song I liked of this album is 'Basked Case', and I did not even liked it very much. The guitarist is a very bad one, he can't even play a good solo! There were no guitarsolo's on this album, so I think he just can't do it. Green Day plays very simple music, and you might like it, but I rather listen to music with better musicians. Lots of reviews are positive probably because they are written by simple people who like simple music, no offense made."
1,not so good!,the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!
1,Buy some DECENT music on Amazon instead,"Legends? You call these self-proclaimed stoner hacks legends?! Sorry to break to ya, kid, but legends these guys ain't. The reason why people say there's nary a bad song on the album is because it's just the same song every track, 14 times over. The guitar player is one of the worst my ears have ever had the displeasure of hearing. WHY can't he break up the monotony a bit by playing something besides the same repetitive notes every song? Oh, I know, because he can't. Anyway, it's very annoying, but forthright, proves he can't play well enough to make any of his own songs. I suppose that's the worst of the album, and that's the most generous thing I can say about it.Thank You.Want legends, try Nirvana."
4,Green day at their best...,"This is true green day,unlike the recent over-rated american idiot, this album is actually worth a listen,simply for songs like:Basket case and When I Come Around.Since this album i have also bought ""nimrod"".Though i didn't find nearly half as good as this, the greatest green day album released to date.I would probably also reccomend ""International superhits"" as it contains some cool tracks."
4,Dookie,"Dookie being Green Day's 3rd studio album and their major label debut and was a massive hit reaching #2 in Australia and hitting #3 on the Billboard 200. Their sound is that of a mix of pop punk, alternative rock and punk rock. The album spawned five singles, i.e., ""Longview"", ""Welcome to Paradise"" ,""Basket Case"",""When I Come Around""and ""She"". 4/5."
5,Green Day is MY band!!,One more thing Id like to add...Im with the O My God reviewer...this album is amazing!!!
4,"Really good, but inconsistent","Green Day's third realease, Dookie, is known to be one of the better albums of the 1990's and many say this is the album that broke punk rock into the mainstream. This album was not just great for punk, it also was great for Green Day, because this broke them into the mainstream also. The sound of this album is alot different than from Kerplunk and 1039, because Billie Joe's voice has more of a twang to it. This album has some GREAT hits from the 90's but the end of the album has some throwaways in it (F.O.D is an exception to that). Burnout, Longview, Welcome to Paradise, She, When I Come Around, Strung Out, and F.O.D are my favorites."
1,I used to listen to this stuff???,"Oh my GOD is this band ever $hitty! Worst musical group of the 1990s, hands down. Even the Spice Girls and Hanson look like musical geniuses compared to these @sses! I was nine when this cd came out, and thought it was the greatest album ever created. I was blown away by it. Every time I heard a Green Day song, by the time it was over, my neck would hurt from all the head banging! Today whenever I hear a Green Day song, I don't bang my head like I did when I was a kid--all I do is laugh at myself ten years ago! This is an incredibly bad album, folks. So awful that it shouldn't even be played in the 21st century. Dookie is a dated piece of pop culture trash that belongs in the Museum of Pop Music Fads along with New Kids on the Block, Milli Vanilli, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer. Its one of those things that you enjoy as a kid, but by the time you're grown up, all you can do is look back at yourself in 1995, and wonder ""What was I thinking?"""
1,worst cd i ever bought (would give it 0 stars if i could),This cd sounded good only on the first few listens...then..it melted into one big pile of dookie. These guys have NO talent. (The only cd I ever BURNED -- and it stunk).
1,The one that started it all...,"the downfall of real/street punk, that is. This is when Green Day ""sold out"", but they were never realy punk, they and their friends at clubs had a skewed version of what punk is. They think it is about spreading peace or some sissy stuff like that, and it is not, Anarchy is the opposite of peace, it is unadulterated freedom, real, true, freedom to do whatever you want. And punk music should be noisey and aggressive. This is one of those bands(the leader, in fact) that made people think this poppy crap is punk, and almost completely killed real punk rock. If it wasn't for bands like the Casualties, punk would truely be dead, but it isn't dead, and won't die. Punk is back and it's here to stay! I HATE GREEN DAY, BUT AT LEAST THAT SISSY SONG ISN'T ON THIS!"
1,Junk Green Day,"I don't like this album, the songs aren't good, it's overplayed on the radio too much. I mean the lyrics are bad and the music's simple and boring. Get the new Green Day insted, American Idiot, or Warning, Green Day are a great punk band and one of my favorite bands of all time but this one really sucks."
5,Dookie is a Punk classic,"If you don't own this record yet, you should!Green Day's ""Dookie"" is a punk rock classic, and a must-have for anyone's collection. It's very simple, three chord bratty punk rock in the vein of the Ramones, given a bit of a 1990s recording studio sheen. Dookie was the album that put Green Day on America's radar with hit singles ""Longview"", ""Welcome to Paradise"", ""Basket Case"", ""When I Come Around"", and ""She"" (not to mention nine other single-worthy songs) and spawned countless imitators. Each song is brimming with irreverance and backed by extremely catchy hooks - all of which sound just as fresh and invigorating now as they did ten years ago when the album was originally released. Before their complex rock opera masterpiece ""American Idiot"", there was the straight-forward, turbulent Dookie.More than 14 million copies of this record were sold and with good reason: it's darn good and darn good fun. Essential listening for anyone."
5,Excellent album!,"From the first time I heard ""When I Come Around"" I had to know who wrote it. When told it was Green Day, I was suprised because I only knew of their fairly mainstream song: ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"". I bought Nimrod and Dookie the next day.I was suprised to find that instead of having to skip songs that I didn't like, I loved the whole album. I highly reccomend this album and other albums by Green Day such as Nimrod and Warning.Overall album score: 10/10RoCk OuT"
5,DOOOOOKIE!!!,"....is incredible. It's energetic, upbeat and covers adolescent topics such as boredom (Longview), having an argument and trying to cool down (When I Come Around), angry at those around you (Having a Blast) and running into an old friend who's changed (Emenius Sleepus). Without a doubt, this is definatly one of their best and I recommend buying it if you can."
3,Punky,"Green Days sudden rise into mainstream, came as quite a surprise. Kids who untill recently listened to Oasis and Blur started to listen to this ""punky"" music. Alternative music was suddenly popular(I know this is a contradictionary statement). The album is wellproduced, by Jerry Finn who ususaly always hits the mark.Green Day helped to create the great interest for punk that came in the mid 90's and they did so with a charm, even if the attitudes seemed a little hollow.Dookie is an entertaining album. There is nothing new under the sun, but it is wellproduced, wellplayed and generally well-written. Chances are, if you like Offspring, you will also like this."
5,GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!!,"With their Brit accents Green Day sounds like what might have happened if the Beetles did punk music...I don't care what you say, punk music is definately not pop, SO in essense, this is definately NOT ""pop punk"".Dude, this is like the best CD ever. The lyrics are so totally cool, and the voices...Long live Green Day and Blink 182!"
5,ROCK ON GREEN DAY,"when i come around is probably the best song but all the songs are AWESOME. long view, tropical paridise and basket case are the other stand out tracks. i have to admit that i was a little dissapointed with green days new cd warning. it just isnt the same. if i could i would give this cd a lot more stars then five. nimrod is good to but it comes up short of dookie. if u are thinking about getting this then GET IT. u wont be dissapointed. blink 182 over shadows green day but i think green day tries harder to make good songs. (i like blink 182 anyway.)because in blinks new cd they have one song which is pure cussing and i guess some people like that. ABOVE ALL GET THIS CD. U WONT BE DISSAPOINTED. I GUARENTEE IT."
4,Top of the line pop-punk west-coast style.,"Green Day knows it's own style very well. It makes good use of the ground broken by earlier bands of this sound such as X and early Black Flag. But they make their punk creeds sound so convincing you can't help but get caught up in the pop melodies delivered at break neck speed and the phoniest english ancent ever sung by a man in Billy Joe Armstrong isn't enough to take away from this Bay Area trio's glued tight stlye. In all, punk has rarely sounded so to the point and stylish."
2,False Advertised,"Now don't get me wrong: I love Green Day Dookie. The problem with this shipment is that in the product detail they say it's the 180 Gram Vinyl LP. I do not know if they shipped me a wrong copy, but the copy I received was not 180G. I am still dealing with the process to get a 180 Gram copy. Shipping was super fast and the product came in great condition. I just don't appreciate receiving the product and not getting it as described. MAKE SURE TO VERIFY YOU GET 180G Vinyl from this seller if it's in the product description you order!"
2,"Great songs, but totally unoriginal","You know, this is a great album and is chock full of really great songs . . . if you've never heard the Descendents or ALL. Every riff, every beat, and every melody is a re-hashed Descendents or ALL tune. You can't deny that Green Day's songs are infectious and catchy, that the musicians are all excellent, and that they sound very polished and professional. But it's hard to not sing other band's lyrics over their songs since they are so close. Compare ""Basketcase"" to the Descendents ""Get the Time"" and you'll see what I mean. However, this album is a great introduction to the melodic punk world, but a better introduction would be going to the source: the Descendents, ALL, the Buzzcocks, etc."
1,A synonym of the title of this C.D. sums it up.,"That's right. This C.D. was just plain bad. Who could call that stuff music? The chord progressions were all unoriginal, except for maybe one. The rest of the songs then copied off of this one original song to form one huge unoriginal blob of Dookie. A fake English accent, a bad lead guitar, an O.K. bass line. Who could like this band. It is pitiful. The strat sounds terrible under such distortion. Thus, I conclude a synonym for the title of this album woud describe it nicely."
3,Not Bad,"Fun lightweight pop-punk. Nothing terribly interesting or in any way groundbreaking, but not horrible either. I'd burn a copy, no way would I pay for it. To call these guys punk is ridiculous. They're very mainstream in terms of attitude and desire for acceptance. If these guys had showed up at a Black Flag concert back in the day they would have had their arms and legs ripped off and thrown in a pile. This is safe enough for your 13 year old daughter and makes for a pleasant listen when driving your kids to and from soccer practice."
3,Smells good,"3 1/2Love or loathe one of the largest modern pop-punkers, Dookie was one major label step-up unworthy of dumping on."
5,The most romantic film I have ever seen and liked.,"Great story, skillfully written, don't miss it. This one went under the radar because there are no car chases or gun fights, it is very enjoyable."
5,Just what I was looking for,Thanks for the opportunity to share---after hearing the the song on christian radio I was looking for the sheet music. My son is a vocalist and I wanted him to look at the music and see if he would like to add this song to songs he could perform---I was very happy to see the music was included on the CD and it was easy to access.
4,One of The Best,"For anyone interested in Chinese culture and its past, this is one of the best books I have seen to introduce the reader to the subject of Bound Feet. The idea of foot-binding was an erotic, as well as economic one, and this book not only explains why the binding was done but also how, in some detail. The photos of shoes that were produced to be worn by the women who were subjected to his practice are excellent and the book, as a whole, is most interesting. Please note - this is not an in-depth study of the subject of foot-binding; rather the major amount of detail is in regard to the shoes.For a more detailed look at foot-binding as a custom, please go to your favorite search engine and pull up Chinese Foot Binding.(The author of this review is an author herself, as well as a professional photographer, and has been interested, in depth, in Chinese culture for over 40 years)."
5,everything that I expected,"This little rocker is perfect for my little grandson, who is a railroad fan; like his dad and pa pa. He loves it and so do I. The shipping was quick and it arrived in perfect condition. Thanks."
1,Very poor condition & quality,"Do not expose to water or wind, low quality thin tarp arrived with torn edge, the seam running from side to side was delaminating on it's own. Very poor inspection system to have missed the multiple problems with this ""super heavy duty"" tarp. Very thin material. Amazon, how do you permit a seller to describe such a low quality item as ""super heavy duty"", it would not have held up to installation, let alone a light wind or rain. Very disappointed in an otherwise excellent relationship with Amazon."
2,tarp,the blue tarp (my 1st one) = 1 star as it disintegrated on top of my patio covers after a few months of Calif wind and sun .... this one is better than in + few more months ... they shrank first (so make a lot of allowance for shrinkage if it'll be out in the sun everyday) and then the silver-colored coat started to powderize and then later on disintegrated too ....
4,Good but very limited,"Most biographies on Proust are quite large--except for Edmund White's small, albeit excellent, volume. I quite agree that Ms. Caw's illustrated biography is one that would better serve as an addition to (another) rather than a sole source. That being said, the pictures are outstanding--although I was a somewhat bewildered as to why some were in there--or in the case of Nijinsky, why there were so many (since the two men's lives/careers hardly crossed). This work is best recommended for Proust admirers who already have a ""foundation""."
2,the monkey can't sit still!,this monkey sucks. it won't stay still. thank you for your attention to my matter on this ADD like monkey.
5,c8r --JENSEN,I upgraded the speaker in a pathfinder 15 to the c8r JENSEN. Immediately I noticed an improvement in the tone and volume. Everything was a little crisper and lively. The c8r is a very good sounding speaker that I recommend to anyone for a nice vintage tone
5,The Standard Model for not too dummies,"It's difficult to find quasi-layman writing about the Standard Model, but here it is. The first few hundred pages are the setup -- various aspects of relativity and quantum mechanics and especially group thoery. It really helps to have prior background in classic and modern physics and some engineering-level math -- but not absolutely essential for a partial understanding. The rather long payoff chapter is gauge theory, with a last chapter covering the Higgs field to tie it all together. Very readable -- this is one of my favorite books. There's quite a bit here though, and it must be read carefully and deliberately to get the most out of it -- not the sort of book you breeze through (at least not for me) and suddenly you have a basic understanding of the Standard Model -- no book can assomplish that easily."
5,One of my favorite soundtracks,"I always collect movie soundtracks and I love this soundtrack (and also the movie). The stand out tracks for me here are ""Blue Skies"" Lyle Lovett, ""Forever Young"" The Pretenders, ""She Sells Sanctuary"" The Cult, ""Thank You"" Duran Duran, ""I'll Remember"" Madonna, & ""Your Ghost"" Kristen Hersh(and Michael Stipe) .. The only thing that I think was missing is the instrumental version of ""I'll Remember"" that was in the movie but either way if you love movie soundtracks, this one is a must have!"
5,pilgrim,"one of the finest books i have ever read. you will not be disapointed. the blend of fiction, and history is exceptional. all i can say is read it. if you're not happy let me know, i'll buy you another book"
4,good book.,"I really enjoyed this book. Intresting characters, facinating creative licence on historical figures and the whole plot with Da'vinci and the Mona Lisa is great. His charactersation of Dr. Jung was very enjoyable. My only critisism is the author diverges into other minor characters without any reason and uses whole chapters to do this. I can see a few paragraphs but a chapter was to much. By relating a few facts or tid bits it would have made a much more facinating read. I was also left with a feeling that I did not really know the main character as much as I would have liked. Pilgrim is shown hopping from body to body through time and space but there was a lack of essential essence to the man save as witness to greatness."
4,The Most Thrilling I've Read!,Sleep My Child Forever by John Coston is a very thrilling book to read. It kept my on my feet all through out the book. I did not once want to put it down. The starting of the book was very catching.The writer put very good details all through out the book on what happend. John puts himself in the position in which the character would have been in. He has a lot of thoughts which is very good. So you could relate somehow on what the character was feeling that time. So I would have to say that it was a excellent book to read.
2,Poorly written and melodramatic,"This was one of the worst true crime books I've read. This is a horrific story of a woman who murdered her two sons and tried to electrocute her daughter. There were so many inconsistencies within the book itself that I had a hard time determining if they were due to typos or Mr. Coston's writing. Research seemed thorough, however, the writing was sloppy and juvenile, bordering on the melodramatic at times."
2,the one I thew away,"I have never thrown a book away after I read it until this one. I read the book with one eye open...I was drawn in like a bad tabloid story. I felt guilty the whole time I was reading it and when I finished, I tossed it in the trash. The book just feels like it is shrouded in evil. It is an interesting read, especially the whole pro-wrestling thing but by the end, I felt like I needed a bath. Sick pathetic criminal that really doesn't deserve to have her story told although the author did a good job painting Ellen Boehm as a fat, ugly, delusional loser. By the way, if you read it, pay close attention to the Paula Sims references and get the book on her, Precious Victims, because THAT is an AWESOME read!"
5,Energy!,"I take just one capsule shortly before going to the gym, and I get a great workout. I don't usually consume very much caffeine, so some people may have to take two to get the desired effect."
3,ripped fuel,"I read that this product boosts energy, but i havent felt any energy boost at all since using it. Tho i can honestly say i was seeing a start in results. I will continue useing this product and log my results."
3,Caffeine,"I'm not sure if i lost weight by using this item, because i didn't use it long enough. I experienced major caffeine crash by the end of day 3 and have refrained from using it much since. Still, if i can't get my coffee in for the day, i resort to this as a quick fix--which i don't think was what the product was intended for. I can't give a fair review on this, i think, given all the above. But i will say to those who are caffeine-sensitive, to take this review into consideration. Maybe you'll have better luck; it's not that expensive to try it."
1,Like I am 16 again,"But I am talking what it did to my skin. Massive acne. At first I didn't think that is what it was but I stopped using it, skin cleared up. Started using it again, breakouts started within a day. Can't say I was able to use it long enough to know if the product works for what it is intended."
3,This is the new formula that does not contain Bitter Orange,"I was looking for the original Twinlab Ripped Fuel Metabolic Enhancer Ephedra Free (product pictured in silver packaging) when I ordered... but received the new formula that is named the same, but packaged in black bottle and indicates that it is *detox formula* The new formula does NOT contain Bitter Orange extract and does not produce the same wieght loss results."
2,"Three quarters textbook, one quarter political rant","The first three-fourths of Mumford's ""The City in History"" is a lengthy treatise on the origins and growth of the city, from Babylon to Medieval times. While there is nothing factually incorrect about this portion of the book - it is a compendium of knowledge spanning dozens of civilizations and cultures, I did not find it particularly interesting. I would compare it to reading a textbook, but it was written with too much of an intellectual bent to be accurately compared to such.The last quarter of the book, however, fell from a high-minded dicussion and description of the nature and purposes of cities into a standard neo-Luddite rant: Capitalism is bad. Cars are bad. Suburbs are bad. Things are getting worse, and someone (the government) must step in and enforce (my) order.If such is your philosophy, you may very well enjoy this book. I did not."
3,NurseReader,"This book talks about Mr. Buechner's life. It is a bit scattered at times as he can take one sentence and make an entire paragraph, but overall is a good look at how places and memories make up our lives."
4,holy goose!,"check out doug thorpe's comments on this book; he's a Seattle Pacific University muse, so his words must be golden. here's my two cents:the writing style of the sacred journey seems deceptively simple, even hypnotic, and buechner has done a masterful job at piecing his memories together into a meaningful (and occasionally preachy) message. in fact, he provides a first-rate example of how to do exactly that which he suggests, pour over one's past for surprising glimpses of God's grace-filled touch. if nothing else, buechner sure knows how to write a stirring introduction."
3,I wanna draw a ninja!,"Finally, a good how to draw manga book!? I think I'm going to have diarrhea for a year! Volume 38 of the rather sub par How to Draw Manga series turns out to be one of their better efforts. The steps are easy to follow, and the designs, while still being eyestrainingly generic, are much more tolerable than, say, How to Draw manga: bishoujo. The best part of this book is it's step-by-step on drawing the various weaponry and armor of those cool assassin dudes, and bad ass samurais. This book is a nice supplement for any of those who would like some tips on drawing weaponry and armor (and not just of the eastern variety), and while not the apex of knowledge for fledgling manga artists it is a step in the right direction."
5,Really Excellent!,"I bounced onto this page because I wanted to write a review. I've had this book for about a month. I'm a bass player originally, and am now moving over to guitar. Frankly, the content presentation (comprehensiveness and pacing) is just, well, excellent. I was surprised at my progress and how much I learned... and how good I sounded too. I think the book works best for those either just starting to learn lead guitar or those in an early intermediate stage. Also, the licks you'll be learning are straight ahead rock too, so you'll enjoy this book most if you like rock/rock 'n roll. Beyond that, I can only echo the comments in the Best of breed for beginners, November 8, 1998, post. They're right on target. In sum, I really felt like I got my money's worth with this book and, if you meet the criteria I note above, I think you will too."
4,Wow!,"Wow, just heard this for the first time and what a nice surprise. This served as my introduction to Comets on Fire so I cannot compare it to any of their previous work, but the strength of Avatar alone has made me a believer. The music on this album is a mix of classic rock, progressive, psychedelic, and a dash of the intangible, which, when added together equals something completely unique. Sounds run the gamut from terrifyingly chaotic and dissonant to meditative and sublime. Guitar is very much in the mix, along with an array of effects. The vocals are really good and soulful. This has made me want to check out their other stuff. Word is Blue Cathedral is the bomb."
3,Comets On Fire - 'Avatar' (Sub Pop),"For some strange reason{s}, this CD's cover had stuck in my mind for awhile now, as I've seen it available in stores as well as online. Until recently, I've never even heard a Comets On Fire title. As for a desciption some might say they're neo-psychedelic while others would tag them as stoner rock. Tracks that I thought showcased of what this band is capable of was the lengthy opener ""Dogwood Rust"", the emotional ""Swallow's Eye"" and ""Sour Smoke"". Line-up: Ethan Miller-guitar&vocals, Ben Chasny-guitar, Ben Flashman-bass&organ and Utrillo Kushner-drums. Might possibly appeal to fans of High Rise, Blue Cheer and the Sonics."
2,Allman Brothers,Yo. This sounds like the Allman Brothers. ?What is up with that?We don't need more Allmans..Please God.Buy their first album.
2,One great song,"The last song on this album (""To Feel This Way"") is very beautiful and moving. It was well worth ordering the album just to hear that one song. The rest of the album is just irritating noise."
1,Nathan's Reversible Grill & Griddle,Nathan's Reversible grill & griddle is NOT for glass stoves. Warning is NOT on box; you don't know until you read instructions. The only reply from company rep was: Do not use - will not work. Item returned to store.
1,Waste of money,"I bought this grill pan about 5 years ago. It was alright at first, but food still stuck to it. Then it started to warp. Now it will not lie flat against any surface. It is poorly made with crappy materials. You're better off spending the extra money for a quality pan. Don't let the Nathan's name fool you."
1,Everything sticks to this,"Even food marinaded in oil sticks to a Nathan's grill hosed down in grill spray. Pancakes, eggs, chicken, bacon...it all sticks. Plus it requires a day of soaking to get anywhere near clean."
1,warped griddle,"The griddle sticks and warps.Very difficult to clean.The griddle is a poorly made product. Will not purchase any of their products,again. Not a keeper."
2,Meh.,"The non-stick (teflon?) coating started coming off after just one use, even though I used a rubber spatula when cooking and a basic sponge to clean it. I don't want this stuff coming off in my food so this is going back..."
4,Can you solve it?,"Cam (a shortened nickname from ""camera"") Jansen has a photographic memory. Along with her friend Eric Shelton, she solves a mystery. The young reader is challenged to pay attention to clues and solve the mystery as well. This is a transitional book aimed at the beginning reader who is starting on short chapter books. The full-color illustrations are appropriate for the story. A memory game is included. This is seventh in a series that should make beginning readers feel successful."
5,"Clear, detailed, and comprehensive","This book explains Active Directory in its entirety - and includes a quick but useful overview of how/why Active Directory is such a big deal... which helps you understand the big picture. The book quickly dives into detail about the things you need to know about Active Directory - like Active Directory architecture, DNS details, domain plainning, kerberos security, upgrading from NT4, the schema, and migration... and others. On top of that, the book is an easy read, because the author writes so that it's actually enjoyable. Highly recommended."
3,"Good Planning Material, Poor Technical Reference","While the book contains a good amount of planning, overview, and description of AD and it's features, it doesn't contain very much true technical insight.I also found that the author tends to get unecessarily wordy at times too. In what would normally take a few lines to describe, he circles around the description for several paragraphs and ends up giving a more confusing description than had he just come right out and said it."
4,"Good read, Pour reference","While the author is certainly very knowledgeable with the subject matter he tends to forget from time to time that we, the readers, may not be. I purchased this book right around the time that Windows 2000 was coming out -- before being familiar with active directory, and before the hundreds (if not thousands) of TechNet articles came out explaining the directory in detail -- and I found the book somewhat lacking in it's explanation. I use it occasionally as a reference book, however, the Index and style of writing does not lend it to being a quick reference (you usually have to read two or three pages to get to the information you desired). I recommend it, perhaps as a supplement to, or with supplement from the articles on Microsoft's TechNet. It is, however, very well written and enjoyable book to read!"
1,Agree with Eau Claire -- This book is fluff,"This book is too lightweight to be called a ""Technical Reference."" For those wanting a technical reference, go to Microsoft's MSDN and white papers. This book is a lightweight regurgitation of all of that. It's a made-for-TV-movie of Active Directory, complete with advertizements. Don't bother."
2,24 Hours I would Like Back,"I was pretty disappointed in this book. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. I was looking forward to hearing about these 24 dates, but most of the book is just Jack being a whiner. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, however, it never did. I thought most of the characters were flat too."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchase this book for my daughter age 14 for school summer project. A month later and my daughter has not been able to move pass chapter 3. She finds book to be boring and not engaging. My daughter loves reading. I was very disappointed to see book that was chosen for her as summer project was the one and first book she has ever put down. As a parent this one I would advise you PASS....
5,Definitely worth reading!,"I stumbled across this in the library and took a break from Chuck Palahniuk to check it out -- it was surprisingly wonderful. I seriously could not put it down. The characters are fully developed and the writing is solid. The protagonist/narrator is witty, intelligent, and likeable, yet flawed enough to make him human (sort of reminiscent of Olive in Easy A, if I had to compare). More than likely you'll find yourself rooting for a particular girl to ""win"" Jack; this is definitely an engaging read. I would highly recommend it."
1,Bad shoe,"I bougth these shoes, but shoes are not soft, I had used only four-five times in several month, for me are really bad."
3,They are very nice looking but have a big flaw.,"And it is that they make your feet sweat like a fountain!!! They look beautiful but this is a problem if you need them to be in anything but a very cold enviroment.I dont rate them lower because when you are in a cold place they are actually very comfortable and look very well, but the swat can be very very disturbing after a couple hours.They are also very nice looking shoes.Just as a note i must say that my uncle, father and me own more than a pair of this shoes and the problem ks a constant in all of us. My feet doesnt sweat generally and i thought it might be me and after commenting with them i realized it wasnt something personal. A major flaw if you ask me."
3,Poor quality for measurement accuracy.,"The square itself is square, and the metal construction is rugged enough for light duty. If you need square reference lines on smaller projects, then this will suffice. However, the measurements are printed onto the metal, rather than engraved in. The printed measurements hashes were at an angle with respect to the edges of the square, making the tool useless for precision measurements. But at this price, it's fine for making square reference lines and then using a tape measure or other steel rule for your measurements along the reference line."
5,Exceptionally large tarp for reasonably low price,"This is a nice large tarp for a low price. I've used it on several camping trips, and it performed exactly as I had hoped. What I love about this tarp is that it's big enough to completely cover my large 6-man tent, and still have enough room to create a covered sitting area in front of the tarp. Note: you'll need to provide your own rope, stakes, or poles. If it's a windy day, you'll need to stake it down quite securely, because the tarp's large size can really catch the wind and balloon up.One nice feature is that the tarp has tons of grommets spaced evenly around all 4 edges. It makes for very convenient tie-down, as there's always a grommet close to where you need one.At first the tarp's weight felt a bit flimsy and light, but over a summer of camping it hasn't developed any rips or tears, so it's not something I can complain about."
2,doesn't last long,the tarp is o.k but it doesnt last long in full sun.6 months at the most .Next time i will buy a thicker tarp.
3,It's a tarp!,I was expecting a thicker tarp. We purchased this item for use under our tent. Nothing leaked from below the tent - good thing.But it did not rain for the 4 days that we camped.
4,very good,"its a fun toy to play with and/or to just have it stand on its platform. it comes assembled in the madrock form and all the other pieces are easy to put on. the directions are straight forward using numbers and letters showing where each of the armor plates go. turning it from madrock to its gatling gun form is fun and easy. the only annoying thing about it is sometimes when i move its feet one of its leg armor falls off but it never breaks, so if you want a toy thats in-between a model kit and an action figure get this."
3,Not Jazz.... funk,"I really love the Doors and my interest in them plus that I had read somewhere on the net that this was a jazz flavoured record was what convinsed me to buy this album. When i got it i was quite dissapointed. Because this is NOT jazz it is funk.So if you like funk I guess this is an album for you. But if you are just furthering your interest in the doors I recomend you rather get Other Voices//Full Circle(The Doors after the death of Jim Morrison), An American Prayer (Jim Morrison reads some of his poetry with the rest of the doors later putting tunes to his readings), The Golden Scarab (Ray Manzarek-Keyboards in the doors- Really good recording all big the doors fans should have this)Ok I hope this review helped you, and if you have to have some of Robbie Kreigers solo recordings you may rather try the album Versons or you could check out The Butts Band where he teams up with John Densmore.Peace out..."
1,Way too many errors,a few errors is understandable but this is just sorry... not only are answers in the back of the book wrong but there are errors within example problems too and errors to the answers of those example problems. we have to waste about 10 mins every class period to make corrections to the book. plus you never know if you are doing something correctly cause there is nothing to check your work with.
1,Tons of errors and no cd,There is a great deal of errors in this textbook. The list of errors for the 3rd edition is about 3-4 pages long. I dont know how many pages is for this book cause the company or the author didnt even post the corrections. My professor eventually had to give out the answers since we couldnt depend on the answers on the back of the book.The text frequently refers to a cd. A CD never came with the book. How can you sell a version of the textbook without a cd if you frequently refer to it.How can I learn from a textbook with mistakes?
1,"""worst textbook ever""","My 'EE for MEs' instructor opened our class, stating this is ""the worst textbook ever.""This ""revised"" version has many incorrect answers in the back of the book, and the examples are lacking. The solution manual is wrong frequently as well. I picked upFundamentals of Electric Circuits, Second Edition (Book & CD-ROM)as an alternate resource, and found it to be much better book."
1,many mistakes,"there are many mistakes... and this book is really confusing...it will talk about a detail diagram or graph.. that isn't even on the same page.... it will just say Fig. 5.6....for a book written so recently.. it has no colour watsoever.. it's like reading a novel.... with equations all over the place...the book doesn't even derive the equations (like the one to solve series RLC networks.. it just gives it)AND THE PROBLEMS.. at the end of the chapters.. are so badly designed.. it would have circuits.. and it would have the values in the circuits themselves.. instead it will say R1, V1, etc. etc.... not a single value.. and in the body of the question it will say... solve blah blah of Fig 5.6 (u ahve to find the figure) and it will also include the vlaues in the body of the question... like ""solve blah blah of 5.6, when V1= 6v, R1= 5ohms) etc.... this would be understandable if they used the same diagrams for different questions.. but they dont!!!what is the point of that???"
3,Not sure.,"Looks like a good book. Never actually used it as a reference in class. So I cannot really say much because the professor used his own examples and notes. I did get my money back after selling it online. So, I'm happy there."
4,A nice text for non-EE majors.,Rizzoni does a good job of introducing analog and digital circuit design and analysis. He emphasizes practicality. There are plenty of examples and theory.
5,fun and wicked!,"garth ennis rocks!no other author,except neil gaimen and john irving,makes me feel all giddy inside when i read their books.ennis is hilarious and very creative when he comes up with jokes. read this wacked out tale of two best friends and explore the zaniness of ennis' world."
4,it is ok,"Despite pictures were not that clear and inspiring, kit helps and i found it to be useful in other activities in energy balancing..."
3,Liked it,"I am new to Ms Eden but very interested in energies so when I came about this medicine kit, I was very intrigued.This is a bit dated video but do not let it distract you. She is very bubbly in the video which I found refreshing but if you focus on her instruction it everything makes sense.She explains things very well so it's simply to understand.The cards are also helpful to help you remember the hand positions and self alignment. There is also a crystal that is included as a bonus but she does not go into it in the video. Only one card is provided on how to use it.It would have been nice for her to illustrate how to use this properly. Still a great find..."
5,Great self-care!,"This kit is a valuable companion to Donna Eden's Energy Medicine book but it can also be used on its own. I like this kit because it allows you to learn self-care techniques for improving your energy as well as decreasing the effects of many common physical conditions, and it introduces you to the different energy systems. Also, a DVD allows you to see how the exercises are done, the CD allows you to hear a description of the exercises and the cards allow you to read the descriptions and look at still pictures - appealing to all types of learners."
5,A Must-Have!,"I use and teach these energy exercises to all my energy therapy (Emotional Freedom Technique) clients and, of course, myself daily. This kit has valuable tools. Anyone who is interested in energy and/or emotional healing should have this. I highly recommend it!"
5,This kit is incredibly practical,I read Donna Eden's Energy Medicine from a library copy and needed something of my own until the new edition came out. It was a nicely condensed version that was unbelievable easy to read and use. I highly recommend it for getting someone started in energy medicine. I actually had to buy a second kit because my cousin took my first one.
4,nice quick reference,this is a nice little overview of some very helpful daily energy exercises. i can see this being a great little gift.
1,Not Much Help,I find that this book is quite useless unless you already have a superior knowledge of plants. The information contained in the book is vast but with no real way of identifying the individual plants it doesn't do you much good. All I can say is that you would have to go through it line by line and use the internet to get a picture of whatever plant is in question because what few pictures there are in the book are just hand drawn renditions and inadequate in displaying a recognizable image. Don't think you can just take this book into the woods and start grubbing on the local fauna.
1,only for botanist,"I found this book totaly usless for my purposes. The drawings were useless, and descriptions would help no one in the outdoors other than those persons already familiar with the plants. The entire book (for me at least) was totally self serving for the writer & the editors view. not recommened. Try ""Living Off The Land"" by McNabb."
2,Not a field guide is correct,"As an encyclopedia I expected more detail and clearer order of classification. For one there is not one picture per plant description. How is one supposed to be able to identify the plant being described without a picture of the plant. It looked as though every 5th plant had a picture associated with it. Second, one would think the plants would be divided into regional classifications considering the title was ""...of North America"". I assumed the chapters of sections would be divided into west, southwest, northwest, etc. Instead the plants are classified by Family. This is a good book for someone to use as study guide for school, but not a field guide for medicinal of edible plants. If you looking for a survival guide or backpack wild food guide this is not it."
1,Crap,I am the only verified purchaser here so I would not believe the other reviews. This is crap and I wish I could send it back. Sorry to be so brutal but that is the way I feel.Bill Kelly
2,What a disapointment,"I'll sum up my feelings for this album in two characters... : (I was extremely disapointed when I popped this CD in... I had such high hopes, being a fan of Saturday Teenage Kick and LOVING Big Sounds of the Drags. Obviously it was the ""unkie"" in Junkie XL that supplied the quality beats, as after he dropped it for his version of ""Little Less Conversation"" things went seriously downhill.I'm just gonna sit here and listen to Love Like Razorblade and reminisce the good old days..."
3,Where's the edge?,"Apparently Tom mellowed to accustom his music to the guest artists and not the other way around, making this CD somewhat of a dissappointement, considering the high quality of the earlier two albums.It's a pop CD, nothing more than that. The collaborations with Elvis and Solomon Burke are worth getting the CD for, but otherwise... not too special I'm afraid.Let's hope he gets the big beat edge back soon."
5,What happened to Infusion?,"I actually bought the import version of the album, and though Junkie is breathtaking with his songs on RadioJXL, it's the inclusion of the band Infusion that makes it flawless. ""Nightmares"" and ""Aquaman"" are the best songs on the import. Maybe that's why he took them off for the U.S. release. I'm curious to know. But yes, this is still a wonderful revival for the fading electronica scene. And 18 songs and a bonus disc at that! Now that's a treat to the regular 10 song albums. If only we could have one full year with every electronica act doing an album to support great things like RadioJXL."
5,Awesome music!,"For good driving music, warehouse dance-hall music, & all around - Junkie JXL has got it all!Great kicking pumpin music!Oh yeah!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Junkie XL since 'Saturday Teenage Kick in 1998' and I was very disappointed by this album. This is Junkie XL going mainstream, by forgetting the music that made them great and opting instead for a more pop sound. It doesn't work. With a few exeptions 'Access To The Excess', 'Angels' this album isn't worth listening too, and even the best tracks on here can't compare to their previous work. Go and buy 'Big Sounds Of The Drag, or 'Saturday Teenage Kick' instead."
4,Looks nice,"This piece was inexpensive, looks good and it was easy to assemble but the laminate facing chipped as I was putting it together which was disappointing."
4,Good Piece for the $$,"Pretty happy with this purchase, especially for the price. It took meabout 45 minutes to an hour to put together, but I am not the handiest woman around. It did have a small chip on an interior facing piece, which didn't affect the way it looks, once put together. Overall, I think it looks nice and is perfect in our entryway."
5,Excellent dungeons & dragons story!,"For those of you who have played this Dungeons & Dragons module, or even just played Dungeons & Dragons at all, this book is a must! It is very funny, and the author really makes you feel like you're right there with the characters. There are also lots of really funny jabs at some of the basic Dungeons & Dragons gaming rules that really don't make much sense. When some of the rules are put into a real situation, they are pretty humorous.... and the Justicar (the main character) is quick to point these out! :>It's a quick and easy read, and definitely leaves you wanting to continue the journey with the characters into the next book."
5,What a Ride!,"Great book. It was one of the funniest books I have read. To mix fantasy, action, and wit is very hard to do. Paul Kidd cuts to the point and does not take up a lot of time building some fantasy world with a lot of un-needed info. The story is about the charters and they are as personal as they are funny. This is a great start to a great trilogy."
3,"An Enjoyable Adventure, but..","Some good points and some derogatory ones in this book. Lets start with the bad . Kidd makes annoying analogies, such as "" enough for a thirty years war "" , too much. And the vocabulary and descriptive elements are certainly lacking. This is by no means a classic of any sort. Characterization is postage stamp quality. There is little depth, both to the characters and the world. HOWEVER. I did enjoy reading the story. The quips and jokes are excellent, and the combat language is first rate. Its a fast, enjoyable read which keeps the adrenalin flowing and the mystery active. Its worth the price, but the author does indeed have a long way to go."
4,"great book, not terribly ""pure"" though","I thought this book might be a ""pure"" telling of an adventure into White Plume Mountain, as in the original AD&D module. Winds up that no, this is 30 years later, AFTER whomever has defeated Keraptis in the module. Still, it incorporates many elements from the original module that leave one feeling nostaligic for the old adventuring days. The prominent use of anachronisms is pretty annoying, as is Escalla's use of terms like ""J-man"" and such when referring to Justicar - obviously incorporations of modern slang. That's great for Disney movies trying to hook the kiddies in, not so great for AD&D novels trying to hook the hardcore fantasy geeks like me in. Still, the flaws were few and the kudos are many. I really enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to reading more of the Greyhawk series."
4,A perfect example of fantasy: escapism,"Unlike most game-generated novels (end the horrible showcase the excellent Dragonlance saga became), this one does everything it should, and several things I didn't expect. The Justicar is an excellent example of a D&D protagonist taken too seriously (as most gamers tend to do), but is so well set off by the modernized faerie Escalla that the story wouldn't have worked any other way. The tongue-in-cheek game references add levity at the proper moments, and for those of us who played the module the book was based off of, the entire task of completing White Plume Mountain was more than enough to encourage reading. It is everything I require in a good work of fantasy, and has remarkable re-readability. The lack of overt sexual tension was a welcome relief, and when it finally surfaced in ""Descent into the Depths of the Earth"", it was so well done as to be wholly fitting. I recommend this book to anyone looking to relax for a couple of hours into a good book."
2,showed a promising concept.,"The cover was enticing, the notes on the back showed a promising concept. But the book was a real let-down. The main character was so invinsible, that there was little suspense when he attacked or was attacked. He always won the fights. Even when he got hurt, he cured himself. The pixie was too hip. Her dialogue was almost Valley-girlish. And it was magic here, magic there, and spells, spells, spells. Mr. Kidd should have relaxed, sstopped worrying about his editor's deadline, and given some thoughtfullness to the characterizations, and depth. The hell hound might as well have been a regular magic wolf. It seems I do not share the other reviewers' enthusiasm. I cannot recommend White Plume Mountain over several other books. Sorry."
2,Nostalgia and mush,"I was terribly excited to pick up a novelization of one of my favorite AD&D adventures from once upon a time. Aside from the nostalgia of being reminded of the excitement and fun you had when you originally played this adventure there is nothing notable about this book. The characters are flat and underdeveloped stock archetypes with no surprises at all for an experienced reader. The moody loner who is feared by the world and responds by withdrawing into his own little hostile mind. The quirky and troublesome female who is at first a burden to our hero, but who eventually shows him how to love. It's a sad comment on the quality of character development and storyline when you discover that a sentient fur coat is the most interesting element of the entire book.So, if you've been away from role-playing for a long while and would like to take a little nostalgic trip down memory lane this book will serve that purpose. But if you're looking for some good fantasy, keep searching."
5,Tastes and Tales of A Chef,"This book is an excellent example of how CMC Sonnenschmidt worked through his profession. I have had the oppurtunity to meet him and all he says in this book is his way of life. His cooking style and lecturing style are the same, unmatched. He's the one Chef who shares all and listens to all. His recipes are excellent and, do justice to the balancing of flavors, texture and presentation. I reccomend this book to all."
2,Overheats and shuts down,"as a couple other reviewers have said they have had problems with this unit only working for a few minutes and then it overheats and shutsdown and has to cool off and then it comes back on. i can't even get through heating up 2 sweet potatoes. i will be taking back to home depot for another one and hopefully it doesn't have the same problem. as far as everything else about this microwave, i love the door handle, the controls and the style."
2,Dead after 2 years,"I loved this microwave because it was powerful and stainless steel, but it just died after 7 years. That sounds like a lot but it was in a summer house so it was only used 3 months out of the year, so I am calling it two years."
1,Bunk Burnout!,"After less than 2 years it burned out on a 6 minute job.Of course, the warranty is only good for 1 year!It is a waste of $$$"
1,I have had this microwave for 6 months and tonight it started to spark,Tonight while attempting to make popcorn the microwave started to make a funny noise and started to smoke. This microwave may look nice but it is a piece of garbage. And from the reviews by others I do not expect Magic Chef to do anything about this problem. I do not recommend this product unless you want your house to burn down
3,brevity aids in digestion,The books in this series are helpful for the reluctant vocabulary-challenged individual. The readings are short and there are only a few questions for each reading. Exposing the student to the words in context and then asking related questions is an excellent way to help the student's vocabulary grow.
2,Did not hold up,"One of the channels went out at the end of the boating season. In all, lasted 4 months and now is essentially junk.I may of gotten a bad one, but didn't do the job."
5,Awesome Boat amp! Sounds great!,Crystal clear loud amp. I have it hooked up to 2 jbl ms6200 6 1/2 speakers and 2 Bose 251 environmental speakers and it sounds crystal clear with smooth power! Highly recommended!
2,Annoying White Noise,"The power amplifier is nice, however using it in a quite environment or cabin, there's a continuos and annoying high frequency noise (white noise) in the speakers, even disconnecting the input cables or setting input signal to minimum. I expected better Signal to Noise ratio from a JBL product.For external use, the level of white noise is acceptable."
5,Science Made Understandable,"This book has some complicated stuff in it, but it is made understandable for the non-scientist. Really fabulous illustrations help you imagine what it was like at Anza-Borrego a million years ago. If you have specific questions about the Pleistocene life in the park, you can just read a specific chapter. Or, you can get a complete overview reading the whole book. Slightly challenging for the non-scientist, but understandable and enjoyable. I'd recommend it for anyone who is interested in fossils, mammoths, or the Pleistocene scene."
4,Delicious,"My puppy LOVES these!!They're great if you want a long-lasting treat (20-40 mins)!ALSO, these don't stain my pup's mouth (he's all white), don't crumble, and are soft to teeth/gums.I just wish they were a bit more healthy..."
1,Not natural at all,"I'm not sure why this isn't mentioned on the description but this product is not made of natural ingredients. It contains corn, soy, and wheat by-products or better known as ""fillers"" meaning it has zero nutritional value. Definitely not the healthiest option for a growing pup. I would not recommend it."
2,lasts 1 minute for my puppy,"I bought this product because of the ""extended period of chewing"" it was supposed to provide. Well, it takes less than a minute for my puppy to be fully done with it. Not useful as a longer lasting chew at all; it's fine as a treat."
1,Trashy and a waste of time,"This book is horrible. The writing is awful, and tge story is pointless. Don't waste any time reading it."
3,"Good, but not that good","Findley's writings are reader friendly, and the story flows smoothly enough. However the plot consists of hardly related incidents and the absence of a constant antagonist creates a bit of an aimless drift. Nevertheless, the images are vivid and the theme is poignant."
5,One of the Greatest Canadian Novels,"Timothy Findley's The Wars is an achievement that goes far beyond words. The captivitating, thrilling, exciting and shocking twists he puts on this novel are insurpassable. After reading this novel, I got the impression of just how magnificent a writer Findley is. He uses many forms of literary structure to create this remarkable piece of work and when you finish reading it, you are left breathless. The plot line is magnificent, and it's perhaps the greatest war story ever written. The deep analysis of characters and examination of warfare go far beyond anybodys' expectations.Highly recommmended to anyone who loves reading."
5,"The best, easy yet exciting read","The Wars,was an excellent read. The beginning was hard to grasp, but after reading through the first chapter, you understand what Findley was doing. The rest of the novel,was written with heart and soul, telling the tale of a man and the trials he went through. The fire symbols and his struggle for the animals made the book even better. Highly recommended!"
2,"Good writing, bad story","The Wars as described by a pervious reviewer does jump frequently between the main character in the 1st world war and the researcher in finding out information about his life and then to his family back in Canada.Findley really should have stuck to the experience in the trenches as he showed flashes of brilliance in his description of the conditions, but alas he didn't and tried to cram three stories in to one short book.I sympathise with the teacher that gave the one star review, I scraped through this over complex, over written and heavily overrated book. I really does bring a new level to not judging a book by its cover (i.e the Governor General's award sticker)"
4,real and 2002-eyes,"We are reading this book at time and we are speaking now about the poets mentoined on page 113. The question is: does Lord Clive Stourbridge existed (and so also his sister Lady Juilet D'Orsey). If this is the case, could it be that also Robert Ross was a real man and not a fictional character???It's not such hard work we think all times in class, but it's quite good and we always need such expirience to know about the cruel and bad/mad past. But all this faults renew (sometimes in another way) this days and battles."
3,Respectable but unspectacular,"Every once in a while I come across a book which I can't quite really get into, but I'm not sure why exactly. The Wars is just such a book. Perhaps it gets too buried in hidden motifs and literary allusions and the cleverness of the chronology that it alienates the reader."
3,A little dissapointed,For the price I paid I expected at least 1 brad point bit and stop collar with the guide.
2,A Powerful Lemon,"Yes, it's a powerful piece of machinery for the price. Video editing, AutoCAD, basic Mental Ray renders in Alias Maya, high-demand games: this computer could do it. Then, three months out of the box, the display went dead. Poof! The nice man at tech support told me I'd have to ship it to the States (I'm in the UK on business for five months) to get it serviced. Great! Shortly after that conversation, the main fan started rattling. So now I have a heavy, very noisy laptop connected to a monitor. Desktop replacement indeed.Seriously, this thing can do what you want it to do: it's beefy. The Cool and Quiet Technology is interesting to see in operation. But it feels cheeply made. The plastic body seems ready to crack at any moment.Good computing for the price, but poorly executed. Tethered to a monitor, unable to bring the computer to meetings and such, I can't help but regret the purchase."
2,rehash other books,"This book was ok, but it was confusing at times as they had many characters from previous books in this - and then they had to be explained, plus this book was supposed to be taking place at the same time as other books of hers, so some of those plots were woven in too. would have been better if she just could have kept it down to the main plot and characters only. I also think more could have been put into the characters, they were really not to my liking. The woman is kind of stupid - she has a dangerous job while being a single parent, she takes the ""hero"" back after he turned his back on her and was mean to her kid. The ""hero"" is a jerk plain and simple. I usually like Diana's books but this one just is not up to standard."
2,Keeping your heritage secret,"This was a good quick read..interesting...but I didn't like the way Palmer writes about keeping her characters Indian heritage a secret. She does this in all of her books, while interesting, I am part indian and I think it is ignorant, especially in todays time.i like Colby Lane, I think you will too. But Sarina, on the other hand, while young and ignorant is tough."
2,Immature romance trying too hard,"This was my first Diana Palmer novel. Obviously this writer has great talent creating characters the reader cares about. But this novel only gets two stars from me because I felt it was written for teenagers in love... the romance portion was fun, but the novel tries also to be a thriller and that falls flat without proper setup and character development. And give me a break it took Colby THAT long to figure out the kid was his. Oh my. And I felt left out by so many merc characters like I was supposed to know who they were? It was like a merc clique out there in Jacobsville but this reader had no idea who any of the characters were the author was introducing left and right with only hints of the connections between them. Just a poorly written romance, not because the author can't write, but because it was as if she wrote for two masters and pleased neither."
2,Disappointment from Ms. Palmer,"Like many readers, I am a huge Diana Palmer fan. The Outsider's back cover reads 'Meet Colby Lane, the Long, Tall Texan Diana Palmer's fans have been clamoring for' and this sets the tone for my review of the book.The book reads as if Ms. Palmer was instructed by her boss to whip up a book for the fans, and she makes it like cotton candy- one taste and it melts. The characters are one dimensional, the clairvoyance with Bernadette was too too convenient and unbelievable, and Ms. Palmer writes some really bad dialogue between Roderigo and Colby. And between Sarina and Colby.I too, am perplexed by the American Indian bent- but I guess it is a work of fiction. The main thing that left me wondering- Sarina needing stiches after their wedding night ?! ( huh?! )All in all, I two starred this, since it IS Diana Palmer. This is definately a wait for it to come to the library/ used book store read."
2,Not a keeper,Maybe I am too picky but there were alot of things in this book that bothered me. Conversations between Colby and Rodrigo and other men from previous books were confusing. Maybe if I had recently read those book I wouldn't have been so confused. DP seems to be using the same lines over and over throughout the book. And I am also wondering why all her characters are Indian now. Or at least it seems like it. And who Sarina felt she had to have her daughter live in the Hispanic section of town.The last several years I have had a hard time reading DP's books which I used to love. Same formula for every book and stupid heroines and hero's. At least this hero wasn't quilting.
2,2 stars for being by Diana Palmer....,"I love Diana Palmer books,they are my favs. And I had been looking forward to finally reading about Colby Lane. The only reason I gave this book a 2 is because it was by Diana Plamer. I did not like the characters of this book. Colby, yes, was a jerk but I sort of suspected that; the main problem I had with this book was Sarina. Why did she have a high-risk job with her being a single mother, what mother in her right mind would take a job that could kill you with no one to look after your daughter. The only good thing about this book was I got to read to see what was going on in the lives of some of my favorite characters from some of the past Diana Plamer books."
1,Bad,"I have enjoyed Diana Palmers books from way back, got this one from [...] for free. Read 10 pages, and really couldn't read anymore. No way am I gonna enjoy a man who screams at a 6 year old child....what kind of man would be romonatic who did that?Guess this is my last Diana Palmer book...sad, but true. First book I have ever stopped reading and had no desire to finsh."
2,"Same ol, same ol","The hero is a jerk, and Sarina is an idiot. She is living in a bario with her daughter because she wants her to blend in? I am getting so tired of the American Indian thing. (I am not as white as the new fallen snow either). Every book the same theme. But....for whatever reason I keep buying them. Except, I do not buy the hardcovers. Ever. It must be because I really enjoyed her books before she went to college.People buy this book used."
1,Save Your Money...,"How can one like a verbally abusive man who takes his wrath on a six-year old? And then he had the nerve to go complain because the child was sitting in the canteen! What a moron. The dialogue of the six-year-old leads me to believe that the author has never been around a young child.Palmer's story lines are interesting, but she really needs to work on toning down her male characters. They are hard to like. And she always puts a male in the picture who is in love with the female character who is everything the female should want. Why should she choose an abusive man over him? Amazon, please put in a zero or minus category for books such as this one."
1,Really Bad!!,"I feel like a traitor writing this because Diana Palmer is my favorite romance author, but this book is more than TERRIBLE!! Do not waste your money on this one. I skipped through most of it and even that was torture!This is not like any of her romance books I have read before because there was hardly any romance in it. I buy Diana Palmer for the wonderful stories of romance and this doesn't even come close. Oh...and I have to add, the story is plain stupid!!"
2,typical diana palmer but not as good,"This is a typical Diana Palmer book in that it has the innocent girl who is wronged by the tough guy who is just misunderstood. Ok, for some reason I keep reading Diana Palmer even when I am disappointed in her books time after time. Honestly, it is the male characters that typically annoy me, and this was no exception. However, I will say that Sabrina wasn't as weak-willed as some of the other heroines, but she wasn't great either. However, this is just my personal opinion. What annoyed me the most about the book was Colby's total attitude and behavior, especially from the past.The best character was by far Bernadette, without her this book wouldn't have been near as good. Anyway, if you like other Diana Palmer books, you will probably like this one. Also, if you like books with very strong alpha characters and a ""softer, more 'traditional'"" woman, you will probably like this book as well."
3,Esto es Palmer ??,"Pese a estar bien escrito he de reconocer que no tiene ni pies ni cabeza, que es predecible y que el personaje masculino lejos de parecerser a un típico hombre Palmer más bien parece un hombre que no sabe ni qué es, ni qué quiere ni nada.Patético el hecho que se le ocurra a la señora Palmer el hacer pasar a una adolescente de 17 años por una noche de bodas como la que pasó, con 4 puntos de sutura y que tras casi 7 años ella le perdone !!!!!Adoro todos los libros de Diana Palmer, me encantan !!! pero me ha parecido un abuso en toda regla lo que Colby hacía a Sarina.Es predecible y carente de frescura.No puede volver al redil de libros como 'El señor del desierto' ??? Se lo agradeceríamos mucho, en serio !!!!"
5,Perfect!,"This thing is great! I nurse my infant daughter on a king-sized pillow filled with millet hulls. This cover insures that any diaper leaks don't ruin the pillow. Plus, it's soft and comfy for her!"
3,Broken zipper,"This would be the perfect solution. It is a nice weight and definitely has a barrier but is not plastic or offensive....However, I have had the item 6 weeks and the pillow cover now has a broken zipper."
4,a bit big,"Fish are a bit bigger than I thought and chain was only 3 ft. long. Not what I expected, but still like it."
1,Agree! It's Junk (If you use with V551),"I bought this from a mall vendor and paid too much for it. It is a fight to get the catch on the top to secure the V551 in the holster. When you think it's secure don't be surprised to see your phone go bouncing across the pavement. Even if you hear the ""click"" don't assume it's secure. My first V551 phone looked like it was months old within days. I replaced it as soon as I could. To make things worse the replacement broke and had to go back to this piece of junk. Made the mistake of walking by my pool with my phone ""secure"" in the holster.....I now have a new phone!"
1,Not worth the money to replace!,"After I had Cingular replace, at no charge, about three of them they informed me that I was ""beyond the warranty period"". That meant that my phone was more than one year old. This holster came with the Motorola V551 and after breaking all of them through normal use (did not even unclip the phone from the last one and it was broken after 30-45 days) I found something else from Body Glove. Less $$ and a slip-in type."
1,Garbage,"I've had several of these, they're all crap. Eventually, something cracks or disintegrates, it is such a flimsy holder. Unfortunately, I have yet to find an alternative. Why can't Motorola make one for the V600 like they did for the T720? That holder worked fine."
1,Good Price,"The item was a good price, but made fairly flimsy. It broke within 4 days of receiving it."
1,Cheap and useless,The holster holds my V551 too securely - I am unable to unhook the phone to answer it - having to completely take the holster off my belt. After 3 weeks - the belt clip broke. Pretty much a useless product - listen to the reviews and stay away.
1,Pure Junk,"The clip breaks too easily and doesn't have a firm grip on phone. My phone popped off the ""secured"" clip when walking up or down stairs. I ended up throwing this piece of junk away before my phone was destroyed."
3,Motorola Cell Phone Belt Clip,"Quite expense for what it is and it is very fragile. If you drop it on cement you better have some ""super glue"""
1,"Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Motorola V505, V551, V600",It took me all of 2 months to break this replacement.I needed 2 years to destroy the original (motorola or AT&T;).
3,Just be careful,"If you don't make sure your phone is snapped in tight, it'll go flying off your belt at the worst moment - usually into a puddle of water. Other than that, its nice because the charger fits while the holster is still connected and so does the headset."
2,does this holster need to adjusted for the different phone models mentioned?,"does this holster need to adjusted for the different phone models mentioned?I got this holster from buynshop but it seems pretty big for my motorola v551. I don't find any way to adjust it. Can anyone help?Thanks,Daman"
1,don't waste your money,"granted, it does hold the cellphone, but, if your hip bumps a countertop or wall while you're wearing this holster, it's likely to break. after having the holster for a week, i bumped my hip on my desk at work while the holster was attached. one of the supports broke, and now the holster is useless."
1,Belt clip drops phone,I discoved some interesting things after using this belt clip: 1. My Motorola V551 is very durable.2. This belt clip is terrible because my V551 has fallen out numerous times.Bottom line: Use a different belt clip unless you want to test the durability of your phone.
5,good product at good price,"UPDATE Oct 28/05: this clip just broke after 8 months of light use. I'd still give it 5 stars for how it worked, but would have to knock it way down based on poor longevity.Original Review Feb/05:I had delayed replacing my battered 3 year old Motorola T720 because I liked the belt clip that came with that phone, and none of the new phones seemed to be shipping with belt clips. But after a friend showed me this clip with his V600 I ordered both from Amazon. It holds the phone higher than the T720 clip -- right beside your belt rather than below. And I prefer the ratchet mechanism that allows you to rotate the phone, but then holds it where you set it, vs. the T720 clip that allowed the phone to swing freely. Also tested clip with a V300, and that worked too."
1,waste of Money $$,I had the clip for 2 weeks and plastic on the top broke. First I thought that I wasn't doing it right so I bought another one and same thing happend again. Don't buy this.
3,Get What You Pay For!,"It does hold your phone securely and is hard to get out, but I was tired of the phone coming out to easily with other clips in the past. I have only had it for 2 months and the plastic broke around the pin on the clip. I love the way they work though and am considering buying another. I am a glutten for punishment."
1,Not for the V600,"This is supposed to fit the V600, but does not fit very well. The top snap clips on OK, but there is about a 1/4"" gap between the phone and the holster when clipped. The rounded back of the belt clip is annoying to me - I prefer the flat-style clip. The ratchet is very low on the clip, which is also a hassle for me. I prefer that the ratchet/pivot be in the center of the clip. What a waste of money."
3,Not as good as it seems,"I was over charged by a vendor in a mall. Paid $15 for it. Be aware. It does fit the v551, but for that price, this holster isn't worth it."
3,Not on tactics . . . . . .,"This book is falsely advertised. Little of it is actually on tactics. A better title would be ""World War II Infantry: Squad and Platoon"". It is the TACTICS part of the title that makes this book misleading. I bought this book to better understand TACTICS, but it fell short. Most of it was on small arms, but I already knew about small arms. Very little of it had tactics, which draws me to the conclusion that this author knows very little on the subject.If you are looking for infantry TACTICS, I suggest: Light Infantry Tactics for Small Teams by Christopher Larsen. There's a book that is actually on tactics."
2,Not much on Tactics,"A well written book on basic organization, leadership, weapons and employment of American, British, and German Infantry, but very limited 3- 4 pages on squad/platoon tactics."
1,Beatiful but with a fatal flaw,"This is a really beautiful watch but it has a fatal design defect that makes it almost useless. If you examine the pictures, you'll see that the stem is very thin but a relatively large diameter. What you can't see is that the diameter is so large it actually protrudes almost an 1/8"" below the bottom of the case. With the watch on my left hand, anytime I reach into my pocket, the edge of the pocket catches the stem as I remove my hand and pulls it out, stopping the watch and almost always changing the time arbitrarily.I hate to give it up because it's high quality and nicer looking than the photos. But it's going back."
3,better than nothing,I bought this book because we have a 1982 Lazy Daze motorhome built on a Chevy chassis. The book has been marginally helpful. It has a lot of general info but it short on specifics.If you've got a vehicle covered by this manual and don't have anything better you might as well buy it but don't expect any in depth information.
2,Pink Moon,"Seeing a postcard portraying Bella Luna, Lauren Jessup is inspired to pack up her child and go hoping to start a new life. Her first job, waitress, does not work out too well, but it leads her to connect with Nick DiMartino, a single dad with a little boy who needs her as a cook and as a friend. Both of them live with the possibility of losing their precious child at any moment; him to a custody suit, her to the ever present threat of what if he's stung by a bee and goes into shock. Love is a risk both fear taking, but both desperately need.** Gentle and sweet, if sometimes slow, this is a warm hearted, hopeful book that will enchant readers of Danielle Steele or Nicholas Sparks. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
1,Am I missing something!,"I ordered this book, opened it, and found a pack of hundred dollar bills stuffed inside. Upon counting my newfound wealth, I found myself 3000 dollars richer than when I first purchased this book. Is this some kind of promotional offer? My God, they'll shove anything in the books we buy these days just to make a few bucks!"
2,contents not as advertisied,first of all i bought 2 dvds from show magazine website so i kinda knew what to expect with this dvd its not a straight out stripping dvd but its a sexy photoshoot dvd how ever the back of the dvd says its 100 minutes long when actualy its only 30 minutes it also says + bouns fotage theres no bouns fotage save your money if this is what your looking for go to show magazine website store and buy jesikah maximus official dvd vol 1 shes not any sexier than laura but the dvd is a lot hotter
5,A great resource.,This is a fantastic book. Incredibly insightful. A mustfor anyone considering buying a business. Mr. Gabehart isbrillant! Bravo!
3,Good book in need of update,"Since there is no preview of this book on Amazon, I went to Google books and looked at their preview. The original price is $29.95 and it was published in 1997 so I consider it in need of an update and not worth the price some of these merchants are trying to pawn it off at.Although it contains some good information, there are just too many other qualified business books published since 1997 that make this one an expensive relic at $100 plus."
3,very good book but....,"unfortunatley I feel the author's obvious weight prejudice ruins the book. The killer was overweight, and Ellen is overweight, therefore is unattractive in Virgils eyes. Too bad, it ruined the book for me. If you want the same flavor without the prejudice, try reading ""This Body"" by Laurel Dodd."
3,Not great,"I picked up this book while I was travelling in Delhi, being interested in the culture clash when young South-Asian discover the Western culture firsthand. I thought this book started really slow, and the writing doesn't flow very well. Feroza doesn't seem to have a mind of her own and seems to be made up of a lot of preconceptions instead of being a person true to herself throughout the book. I thought this made her a little annoying, but then maybe it just shows how narrow-minded she was to start with when she left Pakistan. There are some parts of the story that are completely useless (such as the locked-in-the-staircase incident, or the time Marek loses her). The story does pick up after the first half, but it's a long way to get there."
4,Good Reading,Always interesting to read of other cultures reacting to the USA. I feel this is a timely book and needs to be read.
2,disjointed parody of music,"This album is a favorite of fanatical janes addiction fans by the reviews, I found the songs to be rehashed janes addiction riffs accompanied with poorly crafted cliche song lyrics superimposed over sampled dialog from some unrecognizable tv show."
4,Beautiful product!,"Beautiful product, function, and lighting. I think the base could've used another coat of paint. Only con is the yellow plug in cord...should've been white IMHO!"
4,This CD is crazy enough to be really good.,"This is a really creative and amazing CD that you will enjoy more every time you listen to it. The Pivot Foots have thier own unique style that seems to be a blend of bass-driven rock and fusion jazz. The lyrics are really clever with messages about the world and society that are just as current as when they were written. Grab yourself a large Red Bull or a vente french roast, throw on the bose headphones, and just go along for the ride."
3,disgusting recipes,the recipes in the book didnt sound or when cooked taste good they were always a little to on the gross side for my family some of the recipes were fine but most disgusting and unappetizing for a twelve and four year olds to eat when new to the gluten-free diet
2,Not Too Hot,I thought this book would give quick easy Gluten free meals....I gave me quick meals that were typical junk foods (Kids foods) that were Gluten free versions....thats not what I cook for my children. More pictures would have been nice too....Gluten free foods often look different than regluar foods....I guess thats why pictures were excluded!!!!!!!!!
1,Complete disappointment,"You'd expect some decent photo reproductions for this price. Instead, you get a worse than amateurish printing job: washed out, badly cropped, noticeably distorted, unaccountably repeated photos (first complete photo, then photo detail w/out sufficient resolution). In short: visually horrendous--and that's saying most of what matters in a photo book. On top of that the captions that accompany photos are poorly written, trivially informative, and not free of mistakes when it comes to Spanish (you'd expect some care in someone dealing with Mexican subject matter--I hate to think what the announced Spanish version is like). Also, why does he insist in calling them ""Revolutionarios""? Either ""revolucionarios,"" in proper Spanish, or whatever he chooses to call them in proper English. It sounds disrespectful.This should have been offered for free. Don't buy it."
1,cheap book,This book appears to be quickly put together. Aspect ratio on MANY of the photos is wrong - obviously obtained from other sources. Covers a minuscule portion of the Revolution. Quality of the photos is lousy. I would strong urge you NOT to waste your money on this one.
5,Best Merwin yet,"Hopefully not to surpass his credentials, I must comment on how wonderful this poetry is. I love it. I keep these poems on the back of my mind at all times just to remember them and how I felt reading them. Merwin is so exceptionally good at copying the moment into our lives through himself, using the poetry of the spirit to communicate something beautiful deep inside of us all."
1,cheap material,the entire product description does not mention about what kind of material this sign is made out of. It turned out to be thin cardboard. It has a minor bend on it when I received it. Seller charged $4.99 for shipping and shipped it via media mail. Very bad experience.
5,Thoughtful perfection,"This is one of the most perfect stories I've read. It's magical tale of the purest fantasy. It encompasses things that seem fantastical, but are completely believable. The main character becomes dear to your heart, and you cheer her on, no matter which of the magical young men she chooses."
5,Simply Incredible,"I just adored McKillip's novel. A wonderful story, combined with excellently developed characters, and descriptive wirting that takes you soaring through her world, make this novel one of the most memorable you will ever read. For lack of a more fortified adjective, it was amazing. I've read McKillip before and been a bit disappointed, to be honest; but this was just a lovely, lovely, lovely book, one to cherish forever."
3,"good for history & iformation, not really a howto book","Pleasant little book to read, gives you quite a bit of history and description of the beer type. Good enough to give the curious an idea of whether or not they'll want to drink or make the stuff but does not give the uninitiated enough information to do the brewing. You will learn a lot though."
4,Too much recap,"Good historical fiction--not the best I've read, but solid. I didn't feel transported to the age but I did appreciate the factual picture of England at the time. Ultimately a good read until the author chose to rehash the entire ending in conversation among the characters. Didn't care for the drawn out tie-up."
4,Enjoyable,This was a good read. I like historical novels and have not read a historical mystery before. The subject and characters were interesting. I'm glad it has been added to my home library.
2,A Nice Surprise,"With the increased popularity of the historical novel (non-romantic), this book is a nice addition to the mystery genre. Ms. Gleeson writes well and captures the period allowing the reader to enter the story and concentrate on the mystery. Though the middle gets bogged down a bit and the ending is only satisfying, I would like to meet some of these characters again."
2,Read at your own risk,"Set in 18th century England, the life and times of Agnes Meadowes are presented in a ""no holds barred"" style. Animals are dissected, people are decapitated and every other manner of filthy, crude and cruel England are detailed. But Agnes, a battered wife now widowed and working as a cook, rises above her pitiful circumstances to become - superwoman! With limited resources and amind extremely strict societal rules, she manages to ward off nasty advances, saves a street urchin, unravels a myriad of characters and their part in a theft of a valuable silver piece, and solves the mystery of three horrific murders. Read at your own risk - your stomach will be churning from either revulsion from the sordid descriptions or laughter at the superpowers of the utterly unlikely heroine."
3,A Kansan's Opinion,"As a native Kansan, I often look for books that are historical in nature & based in Kansas. I came across this one and enjoyed reading it. I did not have any trouble finishing it & although it was not as good as others on this subject (settlers in Kansas), I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in historical novels based in Kansas."
5,Second Best ONLY to the Original Broadway Cast,"Forget all but the Original Cast Recording. Everything about this Digital Recording blows every other recording of this musical out of the water. I've heard them all (including the new Kristin Chenowith/Matthew Broderick version) and this beats them all. Reading all the reviews of every version of this available here on Amazon.com, I am honestly shocked more people don't know about this incredible version. The cast is by far the best, the chorus is full and on target, and the orchestra is right off the bandstand--and wonderfully recorded. GET THIS NOW!"
4,Little Hitler,"Excellent read on a ruthless demanding taskmaster who was despised by all he coached, he got the most out of players that had mental toughness and he tore apart those who couldn't handle his constant barrage of insults. Was known to run the best practices of any coach in hockey."
2,zippers defective,ordered 5 allergen covers from this vendor; 2 had defective zippers (would NOT close after opening). Image the fun of wrestling with your large mattress and then discover the zipper will not close.
5,WISH I BOUGHT IT 2 YEARS AGO!,"WOW! THIS BOOK IS AWESOME. I'M A LAWYER IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, AND REPRESENT A COUPLE OF WRITERS. THIS BOOK HAS EVERYTHING I COULD EVER WANT OR NEED TO MAKE A KILLER DEAL FOR MY CLIENTS. MY WIFE READ IT TOO, AND FOUND THE INFORMATION FANTABULOUS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
4,worth the read,Good book to read...informative and nice to have around. If you are looking to learn more about the business then I would recommend the book.
3,Monty Python Paraphenelia,"When the product arrived it needed new batteies right away. The batteries are wimilar to hearing aid battereis but more difficult to find and expensive. The key chain plays lines from various Monty Python scenes, but even with new battereis in it, the words were difficult to understand and sounded mumbled."
1,DID NOT WORK,"Did not work out of the box, and even after buying replacement batteries it still didn't work!"
5,"A must for anyone who loves sailing, mystery and the sea","Sam Llewllyn captures the essence of rural oceanside Scotland, people who represent the salt of the earth and a salty dose of sailing vessels racing the oceans in this sailo-thriller. The main character is familiar with all of the aspects of actually travelling and living in Europe, a level of detail not usually found in modern literature. I for one have found a writer who focuses on my niche."
5,I wish I'd had this book YEARS ago.,"This is definitely a more advanced book. If you are looking to expand your repertoire of knitting skills, then this book is for you. I wish I'd had this book years ago. Until I purchased this book, I had never tried pockets or different collar styles. I had always wanted to try these things but didn't have a reference book that really explained these techniques well. Thanks to this book, I'm now on my way to some more professional designs and techniques. It's opened up endless design possiblities for me!"
3,Not for Beginners!,"This book would be great for someone who already knits well enough to not need it. As a beginner to intermediate knitter, ( one sweater, hats, mittens and doll clothing), I bought this book because it was recommended for beginners, and I still don't know much beyond the basics. I found the written instructions difficult or impossible to follow, and the illustrations seem to jump from step one to step four, leaving you to wonder how they got there. I spent 2 hours, with yarn and kneedles, trying to guess how to do the various forms of selvedge, with no luck. I really tried to like this book, but it was extremely frustrating. If you already knit well and would like to learn more advanced techniques, and improve your finishing and design skills, this is a good book. If you are a beginner, save this book until you gain more skills."
4,Wonderful surprise,"I just want to say that I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this book. I have alot of knitting books and they always give requisite beginner instructions, and then go on to specific patterns using specific yarns - i.e., yarns available at the time of printing, not necessarily available when the book is purchased. What a wonderful surprise to find in this book clear instructions on many techniques I don't find in any other books. The pictures are clear and the language is understandable. I would recommend this for anyone looking to hone technique and push their skills to the next level. This book may not be for those who are mostly interested in fluffy fashion yarns for scarves and purses."
4,My Big Book,"The book is very helpful whether a novice or as a refresher for more advanced - a good addition the my reference library. I'm really enjoying it. Great service, too, from supplier. I would highly recommend her."
4,Knitting techniques,This is a good back to have in the house in case you have questions about different techniques. I highly recommend this book.
4,Great book,This is the most informative knitting book I've ever owned. There's so much information in here that I have to read it a bit at a time so as not to get overwhelmed! I have only one issue with it- the translation makes directions a little hard to understand. Some techniques are still a mystery...
4,Essential for finishing techniques,"I agree with other reviewers as to this not being a book for beginners. That said, I feel it picks up where a lot of knitting books end. For example, Katharina's explanation for sewing zippers is essential, especially her zipper double facing, which produces a professional result that renders a zipper practically invisible. Same thing with her instructions on knitting neckbands and collars; she covers almost every type of collar possible.I like Katharina's Germanic attention to detail and perfection. My only complaint is that instructions are too brief and condensed (I have a theory that Europeans are more used to general instructions under the assumption that your grandmother taught you how to knit -- the same thing happens in their cookbooks).This is an essential reference book in any serious knitter's library."
3,Lacking some information...,"As a beginning knitter, I was amazed at the great wealth of information that this book held. It does, however, leave out some CRUCIAL information for the beginner. Such as, incorporating new colors into works. I was clueless on how to go about doing this and had to search online to figure it out after scouring the book for the answer. It would probably be a good read if you know the basics, but I don't recommend it for total beginners."
4,looking forward to it,"I checked the book out of the library first, so I know what to expect. Good instructions, useful diagrams, nice arrangement of topics."
4,Techniques for the perfectionist knitter,"I am a perfectionist knitter (or at least struggling to be one), so this book is full of the detailed info I appreciate. Your finished seams will be artwork when following these guidelines!Experienced knitters who want to improve may enjoy this more than beginners. A beginner may became overwhelmed by the commitment to detail this book assumes about the reader/knitter."
3,It's OK,Certainly has lots of information for the skilled/experienced knitter but for me it was too complex. Perhaps one day I will be glad I have it in my library but at the moment most of the material is above my skill level. From now on I will purchase my knitting books from a store where I can look at the contents before buying.
3,It's Okay...,"Not very useful if you don't have much experience and most of the patterns are made in dark colors and is hard to see them. Many patterns but again, only useful if you have a lot of experience in knitting."
3,They have such great songs! Why cover?,"This band represents part of the new sound of NYC, along with Ours. After being a fan for the past year or so, I finally had a chance to see them live. Their energy was great and I was really getting into the songs I knew, but then they went into a cover of Bohemian Rhapsody. They played a few more songs off of the CD and ended the set with several other covers including Jimi Hendix's ""Are You Experienced?"" Although the covers were decent, it was discouraging to see such a promising band still leaning on their influences."
5,So sweet,This book is really sweet! I'm sure my husband and baby girl will enjoy reading it together for many years.
5,Super-fast shipping.. very cute,I bought this for my husband as we are expecting and he liked it very much
1,misslead by title,while the book has good general information . the title misslead me by saying it covered diesel engines from 1967 to 1987. i was looking for help with my 1981 chevy luv with a 4 cyl. diesel to replace the injection pump. either there is not enough information to order correctly or im to new at this to do it rightb.
2,Not that impressed,"Purchased these about a month ago and, after 4 short (1 hour long each) practice sessions of light hitting with a partner, 5 of the 18 balls are dead. My partner and I can easily squeeze them, same as with a pressurized ball that's gone flat. Good price, but doesn't seem to be as long lasting as advocates of pressureless balls claim."
1,Too bad,"We play once or twice in a week for about 2 hours each time.I bought these balls looking at some good reviews but I was disappointed when I tried this balls.They make lot of noise, and bounce is not consistent across the balls.I made a mistake buying these balls over Penn pressure less balls that we generally use.Don't go for these balls."
5,Timeless vintage speaker design,"Purchased for a home-built 8 watt tube amp project. I'm a fan of Jensen speakers' quality, reliability, and value. I've used a pair of the vintage originals literally for decades, in a couple different cabinets and amps with no issues - so it was an easy choice to stick with Jensen. Quality of the C8R build is on par with the 60s version, a very faithful reproduction. Classic ceramic magnet, paper cone, stamped frame construction. Doesn't need extended break-in to sound decent, maybe a wee bit harsh in the upper midrange but I'm sure that after 20 or so hours of use it will mellow out just like my 45 year old ones have ;-)This is a great sounding speaker, a bit nicer (IMO) than the Jensen MOD series and rated for a little more power. If I build more amps or cabinets, I'll be using Jensens and probably CxR series speakers."
5,Bright and Sweet,I love this speaker in my Fender Champ. Very good cleans and awesome highs. Sounds just like my dad's amp from the 60's. very well built.
3,difficult to put into practice,ALthough the book covers the array of natural antidepressants--it is not organized in a way that makes it easy to try and administer the advise. It also does not cover the role that exercise plays in alleviating depression--an important omission. However it does cover the chemical imbalances that may cause depression and the elements that need to be addressed in order to fix the imbalance.
5,Natural Antidepressants,"This book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It is the perfect companion for parents whose children have been diagnosed with that contrived learning disorder called ADHD. Healing naturally, rather than via detrimental pharmaceutical interventions is the way to go. Its a much have book for any health conscious individual."
5,Great Book,"Here's what the back of the book says:A Friend in need had brought Abigail Fox to Colorado and straight into the arms of Brady Crawford. He was tall, broad-shouldered and handsome; his queit intensity fascinated her. Surrounded by the magnificent mountains, captivated by the beauty of his snowbound world, how could she resist him?Yet Abigail's world contained a secret she could never reveal, and so she resisted. Until Brady made it clear he had a holiday wish-and it had nothing to do with Santa Claus. Soon Abigail was under the mistletoe. And after one kiss, she knew it was only the beginning...."
2,"Does the job, but it's not white","I was specifically looking for a white cable to complement our white Macbook. The cable is grey. It's doing the job just fine, but a bit disappointed. They should call out the color in the item description."
5,Solves a problem,"My Schwinn Almuninum Comp bike does not have seat stay connections for rack stay supports. When I ordered my Axiom Journey rack, I ordered a package of these clamps in case there were not any adapters with the rack - which was the case. My bike seat stays are about .72 inches in diameter. The clamps completely closed on this diameter but are solid and impossible to move. These clamps provided a very solid support for the top of the rack. The complete installation turned out perfect."
5,Jed Clampett,"The clamps fit perfectly to hold together an aluminum crutch to a rear rack in order to make a flat carrying area large enough to tie down a waterproof heavy duty Pelican camera case. I forgot why I actually ordered these clamps, but they fit where no bicycle owner has gone before in using them. Otherwise, I would have had to use some kind of hose clamp, which wouldn't look as cool and would be sharp edges instead of the rubbery plastic covering of these here clamps. As the crutch I found was thrown away on somebody's front lawn, it was pure luck that their diameter had not been greater than it was, or nothing would have worked. Happy motoring."
4,Slightly overpriced,"I bought these to mount a bike rack onto my bike. They work fine. I'm not sure how strong they are, but that's not a concern since I won't be carrying anything too heavy on my rack."
3,HOT!!! STEAMY!! TO SHORT!!,"Book was good but was very short, not enough meat to the storyline....but still i like it, it was very entertaining."
3,:0( :0I,"The book was very promising. I thought it would have been much better. But it was still an ok read, never read anything by this author before. won't add to my collection of books"
1,Completely worthless,"I used this book in the hope that it would help me write a SAS macro. Unfortunately, it is so poorly written and full of jargon (as the author-provided description suggests), that I came away more confused than when I started."

4,=),"**written by a 14 year old Clique fan**i think these books are ah-mazing!! this one wasnt particulary my favorite but i still finished it in a day. i recommend it to everyone from 12-15 years lisi harrison is a great author! i met her in chicago, she was at the library talking about her books and signing books. she said there is supposed to be 8 books all together. i cant wait for all of them!"
5,"funny, true, well written","I find the whole clique series to be extremely clever, well written and definitely applicable to both young and older readers. Miss Harrison's sensitivity to the feelings and insecurities of all the characters is right on the money.Her books are far deeper and more educational than the other series aimed at the teen market. Can't wait for the next one!!!"
3,Annoying,"Lisi needed to give her readers more of a description. Also, teens/tween don't really act like that.. Other than that, pretty good"
5,Ah-mazin',"When Claire shares a room with Massie, Massie isn't that thrilled about it. She's also not thrilled when Alicia's hot cousin, Nina,visits. Nina practically desrtoys Massies life by stealing her crush, flirting with all the Briarwood boys, and having all the ""in"" styles and fashions. Also, can Massie and Claire get their crushes back before the Lovestruck dance and Nina makes them fall in love with her? - This was definetly my favorite Clique book out of the series! I luv'd it!"
5,My important and fantastic review,"I like loved all these books because well whats not to like! and all you Massie haters out there, you guys just dont get Massie. Kuh-laire is okay to. i feel bad for her, but then again im like a total Massie and have always been and i have a Kuh-laire in my life to, and i dont feel bad for her like 1 bit. So yes Lisi Harrison better keep writing these books i *heart* them! : )"
5,omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the best book yet, i got it on christmas, and finished it on christmas, i couldnt put it down!!!!!! this was supr awesome!!!! massi is sooo cool. but when nina comes in the picture the school is turned upsidedown! massi is out for revenge, and finds out nina has a secret that could definitly distroy her."
5,Bootilicious,This book was awesome. It only took me two days to finish! If your interested in mysteries and romance you'll love this bootilicious book.
3,"A Little Different-If you haven't read it, this is a spoiler, so BE CAREFUL","The Clique Series is pretty cute, but this one wasn't as good as the rest of them. For one thing, they totally left out Olivia, Kristin, and Dylan. They were like, extras. And the whole plot was a little out-there and cheesy. They never really explained why Nina did what she did. Why did she steal everything? Why would she need a monkey keychain? No sense. But the ending was pretty good, if a little unfinished."
4,the 4th Clique novel,"Massie , Alicia , Claire, Dylan ,and Kirsten are back! in a whole new adventure! But this time it is more exciting. In the beginning there girls are at Alicia's house for a welcoming party for Alicia's cousin Nina. Nina 's from spain and is very pretty! She catchs all the boys attention. And the Pretty Commitee is worried! Will Massie and her friends get the boys the like back? will they survive ? Read to find out! cuz i only told a little about this book!"
1,"""Invasion of the Fashion-Zombies"" by bleh","I completely agree with the reviewer ""Scott McKay"". We've reduced our youth to obessive, fashion freaks and teen losers. By today's standards, being a ""fashion god"", a ""hottie"" and a brat are cool. These books show how immature some of our writers are today.Have some sort of value and when your daughter comes home from the bookstore with a bagfull of ""The CLique"" books, light up your grill and make her watch you burn those books to ashes. And when she asks for the money back, just say ""No"".As Green Day would say, we've become ""one nation controlled by the media""."
3,"Good, but not the best.","I'll admit--yes, the plots are a bit cheesy and/or unrealistic, but these books are a bit addicting. You won't be able to put this down. :)"
5,AWESOME,"I LOVE this book. It's probably one of my fave books. I love how much drama there is, and how the entire book just comes togther at the end and answers all the questions you have/had. I espescially like all the details, and how you can imagine the characters, and how in eah book in the clique series, a little more information is revealed about each character. I love that. It's like putting together a puzzle of each character. Out of 5 stars, I would definetly give this book a five."
4,Clique Series purchases,"I bought four of the clique series for my 12 year old - she had the first three. In general we're very pleased. She loves the books. However, the four that I ordered off of Amazon had black magic marker swiped across either the top or the bottom of the book for some type of marking I'm sure. As most of you know, 12 year olds do not like things that are not 'perfect' so that was a big disappointment. The rest of the book was in fine shape. Don't know if this is because it was at a discounted price or not - it was still listed as new."
5,Best Clique novel yet!,"I really liked this story, it was exciting and fun to read! The boy-snatcher had everyone looking up to her and all the boys after her, and the clique didn't like her one bit. The best part of it was when the clique got revenge on the boy-snatcher! I would totally read other books by this author now. So, overall, I extremely enjoyed this book!"
5,This Book Rocks!!!!!!!,I love the clique books! they r so great! i am not much of a reader but read the 4th book in 2 dayz!!! i could not put it down!!! i highly recommend this book! i heart the clique!!!! it should be a movie!
1,No help,"All the great reviews encouraged me to buy this product, but it did not help my mother to sleep better. Too bad."
3,A Little Disappointed,Have been taking 2 pills a day and not sure that I really feel anything different so far. Maybe I'm not paying enough attention? But 2 minutes of deep breathing gives me a more noticeable feeling of relaxation than the effects of these pills... which (as far as I can tell) is nothing.
5,Great night's sleep without drugs or a hung over feeling,"I need to take something to allow my brain to shut off at night: I love to listen to music and will find myself humming and singing and not able to forget the song and fall asleep. Melatonin gives me bad dreams.....this works wonders for me. it helps me sleep but with no bad dreams, it just helps me ""turn my brain off"" and relax and go to and stay asleep. Because it's not a drug, there's no hang-over or left over sleepiness."
1,Uhh---don t get it!,Don't get any benefit from this product. Don't know why I purchased. Pretty much useless.I will not be purchasing anymore.
4,Just what I was looking for,Soothed my nerves without making me drowsy or tired. This product worksvery well for me during times of extra stress. I just take one and in awhile I notice that I am relaxed and motivated. If I take it at night itallows me to relax enough to go to sleep easily. I highly recommend itfor those occasional times when you're on your last nerve and just needto smooth off the rough edges so you can function better. Thanks.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE This stuff,I love this stuff. It's amazing. I feel calm & serene in a half hour. It's PERFECT for your hectic days when you want to bite everyone's head off. haha
5,Wonderful when there is no TV around,My children and I love the Signing Time series. Each video is better then the last. When we want to hear the songs we pop in the CD and sing and sign along. My son wants to hear the Silly Pizza Song over and over. We practice the signs along with the songs and usually end up laughing because we still can't sign as fast as the song! Guess we'll have to practice more.
5,"soothing, and that's not a bad thing!","Still it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface! The ten selections on this CD display Bob James' many musical facets. ""Lotus Leaves"" is a fluid number, featuring Bob in the company of Nathan East and Max Risenhoover. ""Under Me"" is a jaunty number featuring Luther Vandross and Lisa Fischer. The title song showcases sax phenom Andy Snitzer. Some serious funk here! The enigmatic ""Kissing Cross"" features guitarist Fareed Haque and longtime collaborator Ron Carter on bass. The big hit here is ""Storm Warning"" featuring Bob's daughter Hilary on lead vocals. Next follows the lusty ""Animal Dreams"". ""We go ""Back To Bali"" next with Bob and Haque once again. Michael Brecker lends a hand on the bouncy ""Into The Light"", one of my personal favorites. The mood quiets down a bit on ""Serenissima"", a piece which resembles a melody by Tchaikovsky in its beginning. Closing is the bright ""Awaken Us To The Blue"". RESTLESS is the perfect alternative to the hum-drum of smooth jazz."
4,Outstanding Bob,This CD by Bob is great it reminds me of his earlier stuff. And with Nathan East on Bass Guitar how can one go wrong. Michael Brecker stands out on this CD as well as Ron Carter. I can asure you that you will want this for your Bob James collection. I can now add this to everything he has done. Can't wait for the next one.
4,A nice soothing album,"A nice soothing album...great for either background music while reading or doing housework, or just to relax with. I think my favourite would have to be ""Serenissima"", it is so beautiful. My least favourite though is the title track ""Restless"". It sounds too much like a Kenny G song. All the remaining tracks though are all very good, and James' piano and keyboard playing is excellent as always. ""Back to Bali"" is very good and even uses a digiredoo which adds to the tropical feel. Luther Vandross adds an r&b groove to ""Under Me"" which he co-wrote and adds vocals to. This album has a good variety of styles...it's like Jazz meets New Age and R&B. Recommended."
1,Do a REAL Bratz horse line!,"You know,REAL looking eyes. (NO WEIRD EYES)Jockey silks!(REAL LOOKING ONES)No horse TENNIS SHOES! mga, do some research on horses and I promise you,if you can come up with a jockey bratz,you'll make millions!!!!!!!!This horse is JUST GROSS!"
3,"Stagecoach, Horse & Carriage","This is a big toy. My 8-year old daughter just had to have one, and we were unable to find it in stores around the holidays, so we ordered it online. It was delivered quickly and was what she expected. She hasn't played with it very much since the first week, which is why I didn't rate this toy any higher overall."
4,Good book to read to understand your neckpain symptom,"The book shows very good understandings and exercises in order to avoid neck pains. Same exercises are found similar to the ones given by my physical therapist. Also, some extra exercises that I don't receive from my PT. If you have severe neck pain, then the book might not help but it still give you some source of what caused your pains. In general the book is very helpful."
4,Underrated album!,"Many critics and fans have been knocking this album because they expected another Screamadelica. I admit, the album was overproduced, but there are some excellent songs on this one. The Scream is my favorite band because they have a punk rock attitude I like but on this one, they sounded like the Stones and wrote some great songs. It is a very moving, bluesy-rock with a country twinge to it, and it has a very soulful sound to it. The more you listen to it, the more you'll like it. Strongly recommended for Scream fans of their latter albums."
2,this is primal scream??,The CD was in Good condition. no complaints there... but this album really sucks.I have 3 other Primal Scream CDs that are all very good. This one is horrible. Do not buy this Primal Scream album but do buy a different one.
4,Is There A Law That Says You Can't Like Both Versions?,"Apparently, there's an unwritten law that says you can't possibly like both versions of Primal Scream? Well, I beg to differ! I happen to dig both the groundbreaking psychedelic/electronica sounds of the ""Screamadelica"" and ""Vanishing Point"" discs as well as this far from innovative but still hugely enjoyable slice of retro-rock. Fans of 70s-style hard rock with generous doses of funk, soul and blues will like this CD alot. When it comes to music, variety IS the spice of life and diversity is more than welcome. Expand your horizons...just because it's different from the rest of their catalog doesn't automatically make it a failure."
2,"Full of Mistakes, not good enough","This book does a very good job of explaining Velocity, but the code examples in this book are full of mistakes. I felt as though the book made things seem easier than they actually are, and I would have appreciated a more in-depth technical exploration of Velocity. The title is misleading, because there is not enough information in this book for you to ""master"" Velocity."
3,Fairly Helpful,The book does a pretty good job of getting you up and running on Velocity. My biggest complaint is that the book is too old. Velocity has changed. Many methods have been deprecated in the toolkit and finding good documentation is difficult.This book will get you started. It explains the Velocity language clearly. For anyone who has done programming in a variety of languages this should seem straight forward. I would recommend this book to any one starting out with Velocity and some prior experience in client server web development.
2,NO Search on Kindle.,I bought this for my Kindle DX which has search function. I was very disapointed to find out that this ebook is not indexed and has no search. You can go to the first letter of a word then you have to turn pages until you get to the word you are looking up. And if you already have a Kindle you know how slow it changes pages. This makes the Kindle version of this book pretty much useless.The information within this book is great though. So if you are considering the print version then I recommend it.
4,A must have,A must have right next to your Bible I'm so glad I purchased this I need a dictionary to look up words periodically during study. I would recommend this book as a purchase!
2,Nelson Student Bible Dictionnary for Kindle,Very disappointing. Is not indexed for kindle. You have turn page after page to find a word. Time consuming for a Kindle.
2,TCMGreatest Classice Films Collection:American Musicals,Bought this item for my grandson for Christmas. When he finally opened it the 2 discs inside were the same. Meet Me in St Louis/Easter Parade. Disc with The Band Wagon/Singin' in the Rain was not there.
1,Frustration,I received this item as a gift and got 2 disc 1's so I am missing Singin' in the Rain which I was looking forward to watching today! Ugh not gonna be fun trying to exchange a gift!
3,Disappointed.,"The movie ""Singing in the Rain"" was great. ""The Band Wagon"" was good, no problems. However both ""Meet Me in St Louis"" and ""Easter Parade"" stopped in the middle and would not go any farther. This was a big disappointment because ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" is one of my all time favorites!Judy Garland is one of the best performers in the 20th Century, as is Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire."
5,Great deal for movies,"I was looking for a good gift. My wife is a musicals geek and she wanted this titles very badly but they where expensive and we don't have to much space left for dvd cases. Then, voila! everything in 2 dvd's and for a very good price..."
5,Great collection for musical movie lovers!,"This DVD comprise four essential musical movies to watch again, and again. Fred Astaire floating on the floor, Cyd Charisse spreading enchantment, Gene Kelly flying under the rain, and the wonderful piece of Donald O'Connor ""Make them laugh"" are unforgettable moments to cherish. Also, the voice of Judy Garland and the sweetness of Debbie Reynolds complete this big deal."
3,Two Great Films,"This Four Pack DVD collection has two of the best musicals: Singing In The Rain and Meet Me In St. Louis. They are great. The other two, with Fred Astaire, are bad. The Band Wagon was especially terrible and boring."
1,Wrong Movie,I ordered this box of 4 films and when it arrived the movies inside were completely different than what I ordered.
5,Okay versions,There is nothing special about this dvd other than it contains 4 really good movies! It is worth the money.
2,Half as good as Vacuum,"Vaccum is so good, I was looking forward to this one, but its a disappointment. With Vacuum, the more you hear it, the more you like it, but Primitive is a chore. A real downturn in songwriting and musicianship. Hope the next one is better--"
2,If Bill Mahr was a Progger,"If Bill Mahr was a progger and listened to this cd he would be tempted to write a ""New Rules"" routine. New Rule: If you're going to do prog rock, not more than 25% of your music can have a mellotron as part of your instrumentation unless you want to be labelled by a mental health professional as having a debilitating audio fetish. New Rule: If you're going to mimic Peter Gabriel and Genesis, you at least have to create interesting music that sounds like something Genesis might have produced in the early 70's (see IQ). Unfortunately, this is a very boring cd that doesn;t justify the nice art work. A real waste of money."
1,Review of holster,"Item not what I expected. Needs improvement with design, ended up throwing it away. Would not buy again"
2,"Some support, but minimal information","This book is good if you are looking for comfort, it is disappointing if you are looking for information. Advantages: It gives simple and clear explanations about pregnancy complications with some background, so it can be understood by almost anyone. Disadvantages: There is hardly any precise data (for example: what level of protein is considered dangerous, what is the reoccurrence rate of pre-eclampsia, etc. ). The main advice of the book is to consult your care giver, well, I bought this book because I wanted to learn more myself and ask my doctor less questions... The book has very little additional information above a normal pregnancy guide book."
3,Not quite,"This is a pleasant book that presents the Albigensian Crusade in the Languedoc for those who do not know much about the period. But there are some problems with accuracyOn Cathar doctrines and practices he makes a few small errors, for example what a consolamentum was. He glosses over Cathar attitudes to women, with the intent one assumes of a whitewash. He gets at least one date wrong -- quite a spectacular one, the 'global arrest' of Montaillou in 1308 he places in 1309. These are just the errors I recall; there may be more.The last chapter, on the mythologization of the Cathers, is a treat."
4,Breezy Presentation of a Harrowing Tale,"Stephen O'Shea's The Perfect Heresy (The Revoluntionary Life and Death of the Medieval Cathars) is a easy and breezy read covering the destruction of the Cathars by there not so brotherly brother Christians. This is pop history at its finest. There is no delving into the philosophical or religious doctrine behing the crusade against the Cathars on any deep level but those books already exist. The purpose of this book, and it achieves its goal admirably, is to race the reader through this terrible time letting the urgency of the narrative and the colourful cast of characters carry all the weight. Thought provoking analysis be damned, this is a rollicking and sad story told very well. As an introduction or a refresher to this time in Medieval Languedoc, this book is ideal and will be a true treasure to those unfamiliar with this event and who love history."
5,Readable and informative,"I read this on a vacation to ""Cathar Country"", as a non-historian history lover I found it very readable, informative, and thought provoking - rather depressing as well, but that's the subject matter. The last chapter on the mythologies surrounding the Cathers was particularly interesting for the traveller in that area."
1,Disappointing and very derivative,"This book is very, very derivative and relies heavily on French surveys of French Catharism only. Consequently, it does not discuss Italian Catharism, as if Catharism never existed outside France (!), and thus follows a Francophile direction of research never to try to bring into the picture Italian or German Catharism. Worse, although one of O'Shea's major sources, J. Duvernoy, has demonstrated that western Catharism and east Christian Bogomilism formed a unitary movement, O'Shea never even mentions the latter, apart from two or three irrelevant and plainly wrong observations. Readers interested in real Catharism and not the Francophile-inspired vision of O'Shea should try Stoyanov's excellent 'The Other God' or Lambert's''The Cathars.'"
3,Misleading title -- the book is on the Albigensian Crusade,"Do not be mislead by the title -- the Book by Stephen O'Shea is really about the Albigensian crusades in early XII century in Occitania/Languedoc/Southern France. It has very little discussion on the Cathars, let alone any explanation of their ""revolutionary life"".If one is really interested in the Crusade, I recommend Joseph R. Strayer's ""The Albigensian Crusades"". It's written much more seriously as a historical study.If one is interested in the Cathars, I recommend ""The Cathars in Languedoc"" by Malcolm Barber.All that being said, O'Shea's book is fine for the casual reader, who wants a quick glance of the wars in the south of France, and the author actually admits that his book is not a serious historic study."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Not that hard to put together. But this is junk! Bad stain job w/ dings , dents and uneven stain. Yes I'm using it but only because I paid for it and put it together. Would have paid more for better quality. You get what you pay for, not only is it cheap, it's inexpensive."
3,Review of 3/4W Aqualight LED,"I recently bought and installed a 3/4W Aqualight LED to add a moonlight effect at night. I had to buy a second timer. My first runs the regular lights from 6:30am to 8:00pm. The Aqualight LED goes on at 8:30pm and off at 11:30pm.As others have found, it is not easy to install on the hood if you don't want to drill through the hood to attach it. I solved it by buying some two sided adhesive velcro tape. I attached a small square of it to the hood and one small square to the LED and this way I was able to attach it exactly where I wanted it placed. This stuff is available in any hardware store.The light provides a cone of light that covers about 30% of the bottom of a 30G tank. It doesn't by any means cover the entire tank and I would only recommend it as a starter kit for those who are thinking of adding some night light."
5,Princess of Rock,This is simply a beautiful rocker. Rockers that cost a lot more are not as well built or good looking.
5,"excellent, a must book for new immigrants","This is an out standing, well-written, easy to understand guide to immigrants who chose to come to America. All potential immigrants should read it before they come to America"
1,Did not get the game in the mail,"Still waiting on the game and payed $61 for it.I'm not very happy, I ordered 4 different thinks from Amazon and one came from the UK and it got here before DTR 2.The place I ordered DTR 2 from is just one state south of me."
2,Boring,"The graphics aren't bad, audio is. Driving isn't realistic. Mild fun. Gameplay is too slow. Did i mention boring."
1,Not yet received,I am going to cancel this order. I placed it on 14 Feb 03. Today is the 4th of Mar 03 and my order has not been sent yet. I will order it from someone that can uphold my order.
2,School house rocker,We got 3 of these rockers as a gift. The table is too small and useless to do any school work on it. We had to take the table off by the time the kids were 3 yo so they could fit in the chair. 1 and 2 year olds can get their fingers pinched in in the table and toes pinched by the rocker. There is a cheap sounding music box on it. This chair is extremely over priced.
2,There are better books available,"Having taken a drugs class 5 years ago which utilized this dull textbook, and now teaching a drugs class, I have the unique perspective of being in the position of both student and teacher. I switched immediately to a different text, Uppers, Downers and All Arounders by Inaba... this text has out of date references (back into the 1960's, with the majority of references dated in the 1990's), a dull dragging literary style, and simply little to recommend except that it is comprehensive in its coverage of drugs. The fact that the writers have organized stimulants and depressants into one section is mystifying, and confusing to students. The text jumps around from area to area in a fashion that makes little sense. Look for a better book is my suggestion!"
4,Nice set,"Very simple sturdy set so far, the buffet server caddy is a nice extra bonus. Good value, would recommend!"
1,I like the caddy,"Seeing is believing. The weight of a utensil means alot. I found the appearance of this set very attractive. When received, I lifted up one utensil, found it to be very light, turned it over, and it said what I feared most. ""Made in China"". If you are looking for a decent flatware set that will not bend in your hand, read more reviews and trust a well known name. I do like the caddy though and will keep it. I ordered a better quality set from Reed and Barton. Will donate this one to my local church. Life goes on, along with the lessons we learn from it."
3,It works,"It works.It gives a nice and not stressed out energy rush.It doesn't make you shaky,but sometimes it doesn't do much."
2,"Nice on the sky, beware of bodies of water","If you take pictures of still lives, people and such, you may be in luck (if you prefer the warm tone over conventional polarizers). But what the manufacturer doesn't mention is that when you take pictures of rivers and other (polluted) bodies of water, you see, well, more pollution. Taking pictures of the Brooklyn Bridge makes the sky look great with this filter, but I wouldn't say that about the river. I would recommend a regular polarizer and to warm up your subject in the computer as necessary instead. If you have people in your picture, they may appreciate the cooler effect of the conventional polarizer too (I know my wife does after she saw the pictures I took with this warm polarizer)."
2,This soap lasts a long time...,"and that's the problem. If you love the scent of sandalwood, I wouldn't recommend this soap. The soap is laced with other fragrances that ruined it for me, and is so overpowering, that in spite of the price of the soap, I, who am pretty frugal, ended up putting what was left in the box in the Goodwill bag. No doubt many people will like this overbearing fragrance, but I, who love the fragrance of sandalwood, did not. Otherwise, as a soap, it functioned satisfactorily. P.s., I'm female, which may account for my review vs. that of the previous reviewer."
4,Good for those looking,"This book does offer a wealth of information about a number of the most popular software titles for GPS mapping. It would be particularly useful for those who haven't already chosen the software they want to use as these tutorials will allow a reader to get the feel of the software before making a choice. There are a few very good pieces of mapping software that aren't covered in the book, however. Still, it is worth the price just to compare."
4,Very tecnical,"Not for the average user, this book is way beyond what the average person with a GPS needs or could even use. I gave mine to a graduate student in the Geography Dept at our local University."
3,beware buying used items,"The CD is wonderful. But I received a ""sample - not for sale"" printed in the CD front cover. When I complained, the seller just said ""sorry for this inconvenience""."
2,"OK, but there's better books out there","Nick's book is fine. Nothing is inaccurate, but it is a bit dated, and euro-centric. (There are some things about flying that are different between UK & US, like radio frequencies, fuel nitro ratios, etc.) [...]"
2,Helicopter book outdated.,This book is way outdated and the information doesn't really relate well to the helicoptors that are new on the market. I was disappointed in this book.
1,Dont waste you money!!!,"If your over the age of 8 and have seen a helicopter flying in person you dont need to read this book. Info was relevant in 1981, not so much any more. You will learn more in 1 visit to you local hobby shop, for free."
2,Out of date and superficial,"The book is a very basic guide. I was dissapointed regarding the level of information - very basic, and the dated nature of the information. The book has not been updated since it's first printing and it is way out of date. Only the cover has been re-done to give the impression that it is much newer than it acutally is.Not Recomended."
5,Aperture and Christenberry : A triumph.,"Aperture are publishing some of the best printed and produced photographic books available. William Christenberry is an artist who uses photographs as part of his work that includes paintings, sculptures, constructions and installations. I purchased this book because of the photographic work, but I enjoy the paintings and sculptures also. My appreciation of William Christenberry as an artist grows everytime I look at this exceptional monograph.This is one of the better books of its type currently available, and the essays that accompany the plates are excellent."
4,Strictly for The Hip-Hop Purist,"Saafir is perhaps the most innovative MC of the nineties. This album came out in like '94 during a time when Hieroglyphics began to erupt and show that Cali kids have more than just gangsta flows. Saafir, however, emerges as the most prolific MC in that area. Unfortunately, he received acclaim only in underground circles because he was over the heads of the masses. I can't give this album 5 stars because the production on the album is not the greatest, but lyrically this album has no equal. It would take a lifetime to decipher much of this material. Saafir is truly a hip-hop heavyweight in terms of originality and lyrical content. I strongly recommend this album if you want an undiscovered gem. I also recommend the Hit List, and if you can find it, the single ""Pull ya Card""."
4,Oaktowns Finest,"For those true hio-hop heads out there, east, west, or anywhere in the middle, you can't help but like this album. Saafir brings us back to what hip-hop should be about, straight rymes and beats. On cuts like ""light sleeper"" he brings that hard core oakland flow with battle heavy rymes that proves that Oaktown ain't no joke and saafir can hang with any MC. Other cuts such as ""just ridin'"" make you wish you were cruisin' on a sunny day, top down in an impala or cadi. With most of the beats provided by Jay Z (not Jigga of the east coast) the music blends perfectly with Saafir's flow. The down side to the album is the abundant interludes that come after and before a majority of the cuts. While it plays along with the concept of the album, after a listen or two you have to keep your finger on the forward button. But with partners Big Nose and the Whooridas representin' this album is a true family affair not to be missed. His new album Hit List hits stores this week."
5,RESPECT TO THE JUNCTION,"No disrespect to Heltah Skeltah who happen to be 1 of my favourte groups,but its only right that we should give all the credit to the originater of that style ,SAAFIR. This is one of the few albums thats really raw,untempered & skillfull.To hell with all those not giving it 5 mics.After 7 years i can still meditate to it.Peace to SAAfIR & DA JUNCTION."
3,I don't get it!,"I love Kevin Henkes' other books, and I love dogs (we have three). So you'd think that this book would have been love at first sight. But I don't get it. Sorry Kevin! Give me more Lilly, Julius, and Wendell.......and I'll keep coming back for more."
5,"DARK,BROODING,BEAUTIFUL","Marc Anthony Thompson released two little-known about albums in the eighties.'84s ""Marc Anthony Thompson"" and '89s ""Watts And Paris"",an experiemental Black musician who didn't fit the confines of R&B or rap,Marc's music was severly overlooked(Both of those albums are out of print as well).Thompson returned to recording under the moniker Chocolate Genius with this album ""Black Music"".Dark,brooding,and moody,the chances that you will win the lottery and get by lighting onthe same day are higher than any of these songs getting played on the radio.""My Mom"" will get even the most roughest soul teared up as Thompson's voice is so rough yet emotional.""Stupid Again"" reminds me of his unknown classic ""Recover Gracefully"" in it'shopeful yet slighty bitter feel.""Half A Man"",""Safe and Sound"",and ""Life"" also make an impression.""Black Music"" is a distinguished album that actually makes Chocolate Genius his namesake."
3,No propane bottle support,Nifty fold-up camp kitchen. But it doesn't work with my stock Coleman camp stove because there's no support for the mini propane tank. A hose or T is needed... something that allows you to put the propane tank on the ground.
5,Works great!,"Rarely do I buy a product with which I am just plain thrilled, and this is one of them. It folds up so tiny, it has lots of space, it is an ingenious design, and is easy to use. I can't say enough about it. I take it camping and I am typically the envy of everyone around me. It is well worth the money."
5,GREAT,"We used it every time we go camping, it is very easy to put together and everything fits nicely in the box. It is very useful for the 2 of us, sturdy and pleasing to the eye. We cannot go camping without it."
3,"Very convenient, but started rusting within months","We love our Coleman kitchen. It is very small and light for easy transportation and sets up easily, but it is large enough for cooking at camp. However, many parts started to rust within months after we started using it even though we wipe it clean and dry it immediately before storing and after each use. We would recommend it, but take into account that it may not look as new within a few months."
4,good product,Quick shipping; received the box in very buys shipping week (Christmas week). Product quality is very good and harder in comparison to other similar products I saw at local specialized garage door store. Only one glue tube still was sufficient to finish the job. I would prefer to have the option to buy the seal only without the glue gun and the glue tube. Overall very satisfy.
2,Mediocre...,"I had heard that Life and Death of a Porno Gang was as disturbing and controversial as a Serbian Film, except there was more humor and the characters were more likable and relatable. After watching it, I disagree. I did not find the characters relatable and found the movie to be pretty boring overall. I sympathized more with the characters in a Serbian Film, and I thought a Serbian Film was better paced and more sinister. As far as disturbing and controverisal...yes there is homosexual sex but that's barely of note as far as controversy; I've seen that in a mainstream drama and in the Spartacus series. The only thing I found notably unsettling was a very jarring decapitation scene, which was a video within the movie and did not involve any of the characters. I can't say anything very good about the movie."
3,Ok,This movie is ok for what it is nothing spectacular my only complaint is the subtitles jump from the bottom of the screen to the top so it makes enjoying the movie very difficult
3,Grainy picture,"A really good explanation of how grains, particularly the gluten grains affect practically everyone. Even more insightful is that disorders can be outwardly symptomless!! The only problem in avoiding grains the author recommends eating animal products and some veg but no mention of fruit. Personally I feel this strategy will cause one to potentially swap one set of troubles for another by chowing down on meat and dairy. Please please read Grain Damage by Doug Graham. Gain exceptional health, lead an exceptional life."
5,A must read,"I found this book to be a life saver. After many years of not knowing quite what was wrong with me (bloating, mood swings, fuzzy thinking, weight gain, intestinal cramping, cravings, tiredness, the list goes on)I now have an answer - I am wheat/gluten/dairy sensitive.I've been on this diet just a short time and I already feel like a new person. No pills or gimmicks involved, only changing your diet and eating healthy. I can think clearly, I don't have the daily bloat, cravings for sweets or that tired run down feeling I used to get.Pick up the book and see for yourself."
1,Nutrition advice at its worst,"This book provided some of the most misleading, slanted view of nutrition I have read in a while. As the author demonized grains in general I found myself so very frustrated. As a Dietitian I am quite aware of the benefits of a whole grain based diet. I am quite aware that one of Americas downfalls is an overconsumption of refined grain products, but equally so, one of Americas number one problems is its underconsumption of whole grains. This book is a set up for environmental and long term health disaster. This book seems to promote the overconsumption of protein which can destroy a persons health almsot as fast as it destroys resources. In addition, treating the general public as Diabetics is a sure way to set up for failure."
1,A total perversion of research on diet-related diseases,"Instead of asking Ms. Smith, perhaps readers would be better suited to turn to the recommendations of the National Cancer Institute, National Cancer Society, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the World Health Organization, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, and countless university-based studies. A diet consisting only of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables is the best defense against diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer. The fiber in whole grain food escorts carcinogens and other toxins out of the body, while vitamins and minerals otherwise ensure proper functioning. In time, this latest version of the low-carbohydrate fad will look as ridiculous and baseless as every other fad diet. This book is just another example of commercial exploitation of people looking to be healthy without making any meaningful changes to their diets and lifestyles."
1,Bad advice,"Um...........WHOLE grains do not cause obesity, REFINED grains do. WHOLE grains do not contribute to type II diabetes, REFINED flours and FAT do.If you really want to ""Revitalize Your Health"", read books by:Drs. Ornish, McDougal or Bernard, they have THOUSANDS of patients whom they have saved their lives and continue to do so through diet."
5,GOING AGAIN THE GRAIN,This one of the best books I have read on wheat issue. It explains the problems that people have with wheat & why they have trouble losing weight.Since I have stopped eating wheat it has helped me allot with body aches& pains. It took me about 3 weeks before I could see that I had less joint & body pain. It is a must read book!!!!!!
2,Not very scientific,"I found this book to be somewhat vague and non-scientific. It's all stuff I've read before. The 'quizzes' to determine how sensitive you are to wheat or grains are too broad. There is some good info on tests and glutens, but the part about 'exorphins' is just plain silliness. Save your time and money, here's a summary: (i) avoid grains, esp wheat (ii) go organic where possible (iii) it's hard and people might think you're weird but go for it."
5,Uplifting & thought-provoking!,"HeavenLetters are a beautiful gift from God and the lovely Gloria Wendroff. Each one reminds me of riding on a cloud, floating upward and ever closer to heaven. Highly recommended!"
5,Thanks For Writing Lord,"Wouldn't it be nice if God sent you a letter every now and then to let you know how He feels about you, mixed with a little tip or two about life that elevates your understanding? And of course, a letter from God would be overflowing with peace, joy, and love. But God doesn't send letters. Or does He? Sure enough, I found a whole bunch of them in Gloria's book, Heavenletters, Love Letters from God. God talks to me in words I can understand. As if He were standing right next to me on the corner by the Supermarket waiting for the light to change. Well the light changed but God's love never changes, it remains with me all the time. Thanks for writing Lord."
5,"A ""GOOD MORNING"" FROM GOD ...","For several years now I've enjoyed a daily letter from God, thanks to Gloria Wendroff's email. It's like hearing God say, ""Good Morning, Louise!...Have a nice day!...I love you!""Now, I can carry ""Heavenletters--Letters From God"" with me when I travel without my computer, reading those messages to my heart's content.I nominate this book for non-believers especially. How delightful to discover that God has a warm sense of humor and speaks a language we can all understand.Louise G. SmithOrcas Island, Washington"
2,disappointing,"I expected something else. In 'Van Gogh and Expressionism' the Bacon images are vibrant and colorful and interesting. They include studies for portraits of Van Gogh as well as self portraits. They look much like the cover of this book. Unfortunately, the only image I liked WAS the cover. Had I looked through this book in a bookstore I would not have purchased. Perhaps i am not much of a Bacon 'fan'. Let that be a lesson to me.....more research in the future before purchasing."
4,Utterly charming look at growing up,"Poor Willa. She's too little to reach the table by herself, too little to get her clothes on by herself, too little for practically any activity that makes life fun. She goes to her older brother Willoughby and begins to quiz him on how it is to be grown up. Willoughby sets her straight with gentle humor and some straight talk.Throw into the mix the fact that Willa and Willoughby are utterly charming rabbits drawn by illustrator Debi Gliori and you get the idea of this lovely book. Author Joyce Dunbar has done a good job of showing that growing up isn't all it's made out to be, while simultaneously holding out for the idea that there's a lot of good stuff involved. ... A perfectly charming book with sweet illustrations."
5,"Sensible, Honest Guidance for Newly Weds","As a psychologist and relationship therapist, I think this is THE BEST BOOK for couples early in their marriage (or serious relationship) to help ""normalize"" their experiences, be respectful of the importance of their relationship, to face together the growth challenges, and to increase thier intimacy. Dr. McCarthy is wise, human, honest, and wonderfully insightful --> and helpful in practical ways. My full and strong recommendation. Buy this book (even if you've been together with your partner for a long time!)."
2,"Beautiful, but problematic","The watch is stunning....BUT when my boyfriend would put his hand in his pocket, the piece that sets the time is so big that it would pop out everytime he took his hand out of his pocket. Because of this he had to reset the time frequently so I ended up returning it. Maybe it was a defective watch, not the style, just thought buyers may want to know there is this potential problem."
4,If your looking for original childrens music you've found it!,"This CD has a great, eclectic mix of music styles with fun, silly lyrics that my 7 year old & 20 month old love! Even my friends without children like it (which is saying a lot!) Mr. David's other album Jump In The Jumpy House is our favorite, but this one is definately a close second! I would highly recommend purchasing both!"
4,Focuses on One Location,"Allen concentrates on Northeim, Germany in looking at the transformation that took place from 1922 to 1945. In his approach, key individuals are shown to be the players who brought about the change in thinking in the community. His study offers depth in that regard. In considering these key leaders, he goes on to describe how they influenced the general population to buy into their ideology.There were points of internal conflict within the organization. The Nazi Party was not a unified whole. Like any human social structure there were different ideas about what should be done and how matters should be approached.Generally, the public is shown to be apathetic. There wasn't much feeling one way or the other to the average citizen in Northeim. Chronologically, Allen goes on to describe what took place in the town after WWII."
4,Heavy book on a heavy subject...,"I read this interesting work while researching ""Sacred Blood."" It is heavy reading on a notoriously heavy subject, but is especially relevant in these troubled times we are currently experiencing around the world. It makes an interesting case to explain, in the specific case of one town, ""how could they let this happen?"" Just goes to reiterate that while times change, people don't."
2,Awful book...,"This book was required for my class, but I couldn't stand it. We never did use it for anything helpful and it was just so hard to read through. If you are learning psychotherapies and you have a choice, choose a different book."
1,Buyer Beware!,This was advertised as an 8th edition book and I was sent the 7th edition. I am now having to purchase the 8th edition. This was over a $100 mistake...I am now having to go through Amazon to try to get reimbursed.
4,lisa's review,"I believe ""current psychotherapies"" is a very insightful, informative, and at times profound in it's depth of perspective."
2,"Good text, but no longer ""current""","I bought this textbook on accident from Amazon when attempting to purchase the newest edition of the same textbook by Corsini and Wedding. The authors did a fine job of providing information about the major types of psychotherapy, and I found the text informative and well written. However, there are several completely different chapters with newer psychotherapy modalities presented in the newest edition that readers should be aware of. Furthermore, the newest edition does a much better job of providing current empirical evidence for supporting theoretical frameworks of most major forms of psychotherapy. If you are a student in psychology or a practicing clinical psychologist, I strongly advise you to buy the newest edition of this text."
2,No great for full reviews,This book is o.k. but no where near the indepth I thought it may have been and frankly a little disappointed for my professor who recommended it :/
4,Current Psychotherapies,"This was a great overview of the therapies which dominate the counseling field. I have also read Gerald Corey, Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy, 7th ed. Current Psychotherapies by Corsini and Wedding did a thorough overview with great application. I recommend it highly."
2,Critical Review,"This book was lacking in content. The author does not provide a clear researched critique of the economics and technologies. The book is filled with a lot of white space and meaningless quotes having nothing to do with the energy woes of the US. Ethanol is certainly one of the many solutions, but should not be touted as the answer to rid ourselves of foreign oil imports."
1,Garbage,"Over a period of three months, my phone fell out and hit the ground 4 times, before the swivel joint finally broke, resulting in my phone almost tumbling into a storm sewer."
4,Rockin' good fun,"I got to see these guys live when the CD came out and it was a rockin' good time. There was some amazing talent on the stage. The vocals are a bit like Blues Traveler or Hootie and the Blowfish, to give a more current reference, but it could also sound at home on a classic rock station. It's hard to pin down but fun to listen to. There's a good mix of fast and slow, hard and soft, and backing it all is some great instrumentation. Half the time the bass player is playing electric, and half the time it's upright acoustic, and it is like nothing you'd see at the symphony! Check out the title track for a sample."
1,Why is there a seam in this tarp.?,"I purchased 2 of these tarps to use for shade while camping. I have several other tarps, but I wanted something larger. No sooner had I put up one tarp and it started to split at the seam. No strong wind, no storms, just a gentle breeze was enough to split this useless tarp all along the seam. I didn't even bother trying to hand the second one.I wrote to the company for a replacement tarp without a seam or a refund and I never heard back. I am out the money but I learned a lesson.I have purchased dozens of items through Amazon. This was the first real bad experience!"
2,ripped within the first few days,Tarp had a poorly made seem which came apart within the first days. The tarp is covering my boat and I doubt it will hold up the entire winter.
3,Good concept but time consuming to use.,"I only give this 3 stars because although I am quite computer savvy, this software is just very time consuming to use. It is just easier to use graph paper to map out your gardening plans. If you are really in need of a graphic view of your gardening plans and have a lot of time on your hands, then sure this product is fine for you. One other thing I dislike about it is that there is not a big variety of plants to choose from to add to your plans. I'm just a amateur gardener and thought this set would help me learn some landscaping ideas for my new home, but it was really a waste of money for me. But for someone who is more experienced and has the time to use this software then it may be more appropriate for you."
1,"Not user friendly, for XP anyways.","This software attempted to change my computer's video settings upon installation, and then wouldn't install instead attempting to change my video drivers.I am very experienced in using computers and I've never seen behavior like this before. My only guess is that this is a port from what was originally a Macintosh product and is basically incompatable with XP. That's not to say it couldn't be installed but I was not into fixing my computer after letting a piece of discretionary software break it."
4,Hoya Polarizer,Performs as expected for the price of the item. I have owned many other polarizers over the years and only one or two were better than this one.
4,Fun = Double stars + 2,"Double Fun is Robert Palmer at the prime of his career. You have a sample of his hits, and you have a sample of good quality music that is not so well known. I would definitely recommend this CD for Robert Palmer fans or even for a first time listener. He is very relaxed and truly sounds like someone having a good time."
4,Everlast 12 oz. gloves,"these gloves are pretty good gloves, if you're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go. they are very traditional yet slip on design."
3,ok but not great,"Once you have one hand in the glove it's hard to get the other one on. I didn't realize they didn't have a velco flap to assist with taking them on/off. I would have gotten different gloves. However, if you aren't serious about your sport and just want to have fun every now and then, then, they might be for you. You can't beat the price."
2,Too Tight,"They're too tight. It's very hard to get them on, and if you wrap your hands, it's impossible. I think it's the elastic around the opening. The gloves themselves are good. They cushion your hands well and are comfortable once you get them on. But you need to be able to do it with your hands wrapped."
4,Why wasn't this ever even a bit popular?,"This is pop-ready reggae. It's a mix of hip-hop, pop, and it's mostly reggae. The one rapper sounds almost indetical to Edley Shine from the born jamericans. Buy this cd if u like the born jamericans."
5,excellent filters,"The difference in air quality was substantial. I've used these filters for over a year. I have severe respiratory allergies, and they have made quite a difference. I stopped using them for a week to see the difference, and I'll never do that again. I highly recommend them!"
5,Best filter on the market,"I replaced my A/C units with Trane 19 EER units almost two years ago. Since new I have used 3M Filtrete Ultra Allergen Filters, and the A/C evaporator coils are clean and shiny like new. Filtrete filter, captures all our dog's hair, house dust does not let it reach the coil. Filter has a strong wire mesh reinforcement that keeps it from buckling and allowing dust around the edges."
5,I love breathing clean air,These filters are awesome. They blow the filters offered at the BX out of the water. I especially like the multipack since it allows me to make one order and be good for over a year.
5,Gotta have it,"This is a great way to buy these needed filters in a more convenient quantity. I only use one at a time, but need to change them often enough to find this a useful package."
4,As advertised!,"I used to buy these from Home Depot for nearly $17 a piece. To be able to buy them in a 6 pack at this price is awesome! I also saw them at Costco so that you could buy a 3 pack for about $36, but they didn't have the correct 14 X 25 X 1 size. If you are looking for a good filter at a good price, buy these!"
4,Great Filter...Good price,"Having children with Allergies, a good filter is a must. We have seen a reduction in dust in the house since putting these filters in. the kids have had less issues with their seasonal allergies, even with spring in the air. They are more expensive than a standard filter (about double the cost) but well worth it if you have people with allergies in the home,"
1,too much air flow restriction,I did not read the reviews and bought these 6-packs. I trusted 3M. However it is not working well since it has too much air flow restriction. My furnace now has a high pitch sound and start/stop much more often. My old dirty non-branded filter works fine. Several people raised this issue in the reviews but I did not read them beforehand :-(Now not sure if I can find a high quality filter with minimal air flow restriction.
4,Caveat Emptor (aka Buyer Beware),"It is difficult to evaluate how effective Filtrete Ultra 1500 air filter really is, but I have been using them for many years and I feel relatively certain that they do help mitigate the pollen count in the house and provide some relief for my seasonal allergies.However, I do caution buyers to shop for the best price on the internet. Recently Amazon raised their price, which now makes them slightly less competitive with National Allergy, which charges a shipping fee of $12.99. I normally wouldn't quibble over a couple of dollars, but with me it is a matter of principle. Amazon claims that there is no shipping charge for orders of $25 or more, but when the shipping is imbedded in the product price it just doesn't smell right."
5,"Good product, good price","We use these filters in two zones in our house, so getting a good price is important. The filters work well and I like the convenience of having them delivered to my door."
1,Doesn't fit precision systems - size of filter is wrong,"I'm a religious Amazon user and this is the first product endorsement I've ever written - that should tell you something about how I feel about these.These filters are advertised as 14"" x 24"", with actual dimensions of 13.7"" x 23.7"". What they don't tell you is that the size of the filter is actually somewhere between the actual dimensions and the advertised dimensions. My system is precisely 13.7"" x 23.7"", but there things are really 13.8"" x 23.9"". Thus, they don't fit. I had to peel away the cardboard liner and partially destroy the filter in order to jam it into my unit. A waste of time and money."
3,if only there really were 6,"This is a great filter but it isn't really a 6-pack - it's just one filter. Fortunatley, the seller acknowledged that the ad is setup incorrectly and gave me a full refund and let me keep the one filter they shipped at no charge."
2,disappointed,"I haven't used this product. I ordered a pack of 6, but only one arrived and the end was crushed. The vendor,Bic, did credit it back to me, but I was disappointed that no explanation was made as to why I only received one."
1,the description is a lie. this is for ONE filter not SIX,"Day 1I just received my single filter on this order. Thanks for the 16.95 shipping charge. The filter is totally mangled. I will be posting bad ratings daily until I get a full refund. Right now I am cautiously optimistic of BuilderDepot's customer service efforts. We will see what the next day holds for them. I wish I could attach a picture so you all could see how pathetic the packaging is. It seems plain to me that the spent about 2.00 on shipping this product. Totally unsatisfactory.Oh and the description is a LIE. The price is for one filter not six.Day 2From BuilderDepot ""I am requesting a shipper claim and when it is settled will refund.""So now I have to wait for the clam????"
1,Do not buy this from Amazon!,"Amazon advertises this as a 6 pack. The vendor sent a 4 pack. The vendor claims Amazon misrepresented it and they would not honor it. They paid for the return, but Amazon would not help. VERY DISAPPOINTED............"
3,Filtrete Ultra,Good price and item as advertised but arrived with 2 out of 6 filters bent out of shape. I didn't return since i could stretch them out and didn't want to go through the hassle.
1,Very expensive filter...you just don't know it yet,On a brand new furnace we've been using these filters for 8 years..changed religioulsy every month (more than recomended..and not cheap). Just fried the blower motor on our furnace. Nice little $500 fix! Tech says these filters are too restrictive and he sees this ALL THE TIME. We're done with these filters!! Thanks 3M!
5,Works great in a house that needs all the help it can get...,"Length:: 0:20 Mins...from the effects of a dense regional pollen environment and a never-ending supply of the fallout from an exuberant short-haired dog and a long-haired cat.I swap these out every two months, and when I see what is trapped in the filter element, I'm glad it's not in our air or settling back on to the floors and furniture.Obviously, no filter is going to make a house dust-free. But when running a heat pump for summer cooling and winter heating, anything that reduces the particulates is a welcome bit of assistance."
3,Not for a beginner!! Too Technical,"I'm not going to get very wordy, but the book starts out good for the non-technical person but rapidly gets way over the beginner's head. This book is definitely oriented for Systems Administrators and Network Engineers."
3,Too bad this was not more professionally written.,"This one could have been a contender. Too bad that three authors invested so much time and still could not pull off a professional product. Too bad that their editrs were so sloppy as to leave in way too many typographical errors and usage errors. In addition, it seems that they were more than a bit sloppy in leaving way too many loose ends and innuendoes. They make assumptions on too many points that a simple phone call could have revealed much more information. (e.g. How does Netscape store passwd information??)"
4,creepy,"My friend has this unusual massager. When it's first used it feels creepy, but after that it feels good. REALLY good.There is one problem though. The extensions are made of wires that can bend easily. If something happens to it and the extensions get bent, it will look deformed (even after you try to bend them back to their origonal placements). It will still work though.It will give you the weirdest feeling, but not a bad feeling. It is hard to explain how it makes you feel."
3,Beware of this seller and be aware of this product's name,"I ordered one of these as a gift for a friend. I expected a product called ""The Tingler,"" and instead I got a product called ""Happy's Head Trip."" Luckily my friend won't mind, and I don't mind much, but that's a ridiculous name, and if I had known that was what the package I was buying would say, I would have bought another brand.Secondly, the package I received (one of those plastic blister-packs) was NOT NEW. It had been opened and scotch-taped back together at the bottom. Luckily my friend won't mind, but I do. When buying gifts from Amazon I prefer to get new, unopened products. I will feel like a loser giving this opened package as a present.I'm sure the head massager is fine, I just wish I'd gotten an unopened one and that it didn't have such a stupid drug reference for a name."
5,Great Deal...Buy these speakers,"Act now. Do not let this deal pass you by. For under two-hundred bucks for a pair (including S/H), you will not be sorry. I am already thrilled with the quality and sound of these speakers. And I am still in the recommended ""breaking in period."" I will update my review if needed once I can fully test their capabilities, but I can already tell these are an excellent value compared to speakers listed at 2 or 3 times the price. I had planned on buying a pair of Polk 50s as I owned an original set of Polk 10 Monitors back in the day. However, the Athena's have a ported 6.5 woofer, and reviews suggested the Polk's were a bit weak in the bottom end. And the Athena's are substantially cheaper when you figure in S/H."
5,OH!,"Oh, of all the nancy drew books i have read (and that's a lot) i think this 1 must B my favorite! Nancy is dealing w/ a graveyard and tons of other sticky situations, this book is absolutely and must have!"
2,Good software but I expected more.,I was looking for a piece of software that could help my son better prepare for middle school during the summer. One of the things that I expected was that each 'unit' would have some kind of test or quiz so we could track his progress and this title had very little of that. At this point we are using it as 'guided computer time' and looking for another package that can do a better job of tracking and reporting his progress.
3,Buy a used copy!,"These Encore educational sets, though labeled with the latest year in the edition they're trying to sell at any given moment, are really changed very little from one edition to the next - which explains the phenomena of the ""extra"" drivers needed for XP which an earlier reviewer noted.The good news is that these sets are commonly available, used, for five bucks or less in the thrift stores... and they are worth that amount, certainly. So I'd suggest trying an old copy first, then deciding if the latest and greatest revision is worth the upgrade to you."
4,Middle School Advantage 2006,Great product. Am having some difficulty loading one of the CD. Contacted the publisher of the product and they are of no help with support. I would recommend this to everyone.
5,It was exactly what I needed,It was exactly what I needed. The product was shipped with no damage and once installed the steering was great..
5,Do yourself a favor and buy this album now,"This is by far Biohazard's best. I've been a Biohazard fan for years, and this is Biohazard at thier best. 5 blocks to the Subway and How it Is just make you wanna turn up the volume till your speakers blow. If you don't know Biohazard, you don't have a clue about metal."
4,excellent,"I have absolutely no baseline knowledge of Biohazard or this type of metal, but when grabbing piles of CDs to review, this fell out. I can take a hint.In pure sound terms, I like this: the razor fuzz guitars, unexpected detours in the tracks, and the military style backing vocals. Lots and lots of syncopation. This music is definitely heavy metal, but I can hear a lot of craft--the music behind the noise. This is not often not worth the effort in pop metal and impossible in the hardest of the hardcore, so here, the balance is revealing.I actually think this CD was given to me as a gift, but it is enough to convince me to buy more."
5,State of perfection ...,"With 'State of the World Address', Biohazard members reached perfection in their unique hard-core/metal style. To my own opinion, they have never issued such a good album again. It's hard to tell what I felt listening these (ALL) terrific songs when they got released ten years ago... Then, Biohazard was the band I used to revere the most at this time and, 'State of...' remained in my top of the list for a very long time..."
2,Letdown,"This was a BIG disappointment and letdown coming off of the Urban Discipline album. If you want any Biohazard, buy their first two albums."
2,Sounds like one long song...,"I love Tabla drumming, but to be honest, this CD is too repetitive. It all sounds like one long, never ending track. Maybe it would be good as background when you're not really paying attention. Nope, no it wouldn't, because you'd be noticing how one track blends into the other into the other into the other. It's just too repetitive. Like this review."
4,Techno Tabla Bliss Inferno,"Well, Tabla is what we've got here, and lot's of it. This is very good. It's mostly beats, the other sounds, which are a blend of classic Indian and electronica, are the minimum. Some vocals are happening, and add to the good flavor that this disk provides. This is not like Talvin Sing's, ""OK"", really just Tabla beats. It does rock, though. But, personally, I like more sitar and instruments other than just percussion mainly. That's why I give it a 4. This is a recommendation for those into Indian Tabla percussion, along with some synthy sounds and electro beats. Not as heady as ""Shri Durga"", by DJ Cheb I Sabbah. Swami Veet Asmito, Osho Sannyasan"
5,What a video!,"Outstanding video that teaches through humor, warmth and sincerity. Presenting everyday scenarios that everyone can relate too, Paul and Nicole deserve kudos and gratitude for helping open viewers eyes to the way towards healthier and happier relationships. Great contribution, guys. I highly recommend this video to individuals and couples seeking higher ground. Plays especially well in group settings. Buy this video. You'll be glad you did."
1,a bit informatin here and there,"The book has some useful information about J2EE here and there, but since this is a book serves a guidance for the SCEA exam, most of the contents are either too shallow or irrelevant for that purpose. Don't expect that you can rely on this book only and pass the exam.There are some errors in the self check questions, but most of the time, the answers given are the oppsite of the correct answers to the question asked and I believe these are editing problems."
1,Copied from Sun Documentation,"The statements in the book reads as a SUN document. So if you dont want to take the trouble to sit in front of a computer and search through all the links for certification objectives in SUN website, you can purchase this book."
1,Poorly written book with many redundant and confusing info,"I am using this book for J2EE study. After reading chapter 1 and 2, I have to say this is one of the worst tech books I ever read. The materials are harshly composed, often without a consistent and clear framework on various topics (what an irony on a book about a framework). From time to time, I have the impression that the authors just pulled some paragraphs from various articles and piled them together. This gives me the further impression that the authors don't really understand those subjects well enough to distill the essentials out and present them in an organized manner. Unless you are already an expert in those subjects, you will find yourself confused by this book and walk away with more questions than before.Definitely not recommended for anybody."
2,Don't be fooled,"This book claims ""100% coverage"" in large font on the cover. Certainly, you shouldn't take that as ""read this book and you're done"".This book absolutely does not cover everything that's in the test. It lacks information on Java Server Faces, on Java Messaging Service (it has an entire chapter on JMS, but it lacks specifics that will be on the exam), on Web Services support in JEE, and so on. For those topics that it does cover, this book doesn't explain at introductory level.That means that this book is no good starter's guide to get introduced to all the relevant themes, nor is it good at providing you with all the details that you need on the topics covered. It gives you an idea of those topics covered by the exam, which is helpful to decide which other books you must read. And nothing more."
3,It is not a Head First but it is very good,"First of all sorry for my english, i'm brazilian.I bought this book after the pain of reading the Study Guide from Sun Microsystems, so it was really good. There are some mistakes that would confuse some inexperienced developers, but the level of skill required for the certification would make the own reader fix it. Good reading, good coverage of subjects, the exercises are not so good but they do their work. A very good benefit i found was cd wich comes with the book, it help me to read it at work on time between tasks."
4,Excellent J2EE Review For Advanced Developers,"I hesitated to buy this book after reading other people's reviews, but I finally got it and thought it was quite impressive. The newest version covers up to J2EE 1.4. There is a simple code example for each pattern that clarifies the meaning. There is an excellent chapter dedicated to Java Connector Architecture 1.5. I've been reading this book at work as I wait for my slow computer to deploy applications to WebSphere, and it seems highly relevant. You should definitely read other books to become an architect, as I have done. I've basically read the other top-selling architecture books before this one. You should also read specific books on security and internationalization. I didn't see many bugs other than a few misworded practice questions. It's definitely worth the time and money."
1,"Waste of Time, Money and Energy","This is a waste book that makes you go to sleep in 2 minutes. the content is poorly organized, the authors don't seem to have any knowledge of the topics covered for the exam. This book totally is a waste of your time, money and energy."
1,Waste of time,"This book is terribly disorganized, repetitive and has numerouserrors. Unfortunately, it seems to be one of only 2 booksavailable on this certification. The only chapter that was worthreading was the one on JMS. The rest of the book was eminentlyunreadable. I suggest reading ""UML Distilled"", theDesign Patterns book by Gamma et al, and a good book on EJBs,messaging and JCA, instead of wasting time and effort overthis book."
1,"many mistakes, many irrelevant content - who was it written for?","I'm not sure what the people were thinking who put this book together. There's lots of information thrown in her, but much that isn't applicable to either being an architect, or to passing the exam.This is not a good book, and it will not help you pass the SCEA exam."
2,Sloppy writing and poor editing,"This book reads as if it were written entirely between the hours of 2&5AM. It is more like an 11th hour paper one would write all night in college to barely make the deadline, than a well structured book that is written and rewritten to achieve its purpose. This is disturbing since the goal of reading it is to obtain a certification in software architecture, a discipline that demands quality execution to ensure success. The book is repeative across chapters, unstructured within any given chapter, poorly defines concepts and terms and generally frustrates the reader with obfuscated and needlessly complicated sentence structure. The content can be moderately useful if the reader has the patience to read and re-read passages when necessary. A heavily edited and refined second edition could succeed if the need to dwell on poorly written passages and definitions was totally eliminated. Proper grammar and spelling would be a nice touch too."
1,Disappointing,"At the first glance, the book appeared to cover all of the certification objectives. But to my disappointment, I found that the book is very badly written. The concepts are not organized logically and a lot of sentences are repeated verbatim. The authors keeps on rambling about various things without making any clear point. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Good time waste,"I purchased this book last month. In one month, I am able to read only two chapters of this book. This book is not organized properly. It has more than 500 pages of boring essays. This certification is for java developers not law makers. Chapters has been made big by repeating the same lines but in different ways. After reading the whole chapter, I always felt like I have read two - three lines of info. It should be technically organized for example more diagrams, making list of technical points, using bullets."
1,too many errors,"The book has a lot of errors, but is actually good in some areas. The CDROM is unbelievable. It is as if it were a first draft of the book. The practice exams on the CD make no sense at times and are worthless as a study aid."
1,What a shame,"I bought this book after reading other osborne's certification books. I thought the quality would be similar, but it's a shame I was totally wrong....After seeing some people rating this book with 5 stars I think they haven't been fair. If you pass the exam it doesn't mean the book is good, maybe you already had some experience on the subject.I DON'T think this book is worth the money it costs. At most I would buy it sharing costs with some friends so that we all can read the pdf version.Finally, and just to make it clear, the CD does NOT contain 2 sample exams. It only contains one exam and after registering at osborne you'll be given a chance for a second one. Slight difference. Both exams have some ambiguous questions and wrong ones..."
1,Complete Trash,The authors appear not to comprehend the material they purport to be presenting. Terms and concepts that a rank novice should already know are presented very badly while material that does need to be explained is simply ignored. Complete garbage.
1,The book is a poor assembly of Sun tutorials,This is a poorly edited and incoherently put together from SUN's J2EE tutorials. What a shame.
4,very good book,The overall quality of the book is very good. The JMS chapter is particularly terrific.
1,Very poorly written,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is very poorly written. After reading the first few chapters and have found a half dozen spelling mistakes and several sentences that don't make sense, you have to know that this book was rushed out the door.What's worse than that for your typical SCEA candidate is the amount of time that is wasted with repetitive or unnecessary information. I've got very little time in my day to read books, and the last thing I need is an author inserting fluff around the core material just to make the book look bigger. This ""user-friendly"" writing style is best kept in the ""X For Dummies"" series, and kept out of books for busy professionals.The other SCEA book (Cade and Roberts) is a much better buy. I'd recommend buying only that one and supplementing it with other subject-specific books (EJB, UML, Patterns) instead of wasting your money and time with this one."
3,A bit long,I like the book. Love the message. It's just a little long for the age group. I'm also not fond of the dialogue set up.
5,very good,"a scary topic that is put into a story setting to share with your children. we found the age range to be a little younger than we were ready to share that much, but the material is great when you feel your child is ready for it!"
5,Great book,"This entire series is great for introducing sex in a godly way from a young age. I have found them to be informative, honest and clear about the importance of sex being saved for marriage."
3,Not Suitable For 3 To 5,"I bought this book for my newly turned 4 year old daughter and after reading through it myself, I think I will shelf it for another few years. The birth process part of the story is too graphic and too much information for her. Also, it talks just a little more about how babies are made than I am ready to share with her. I also bought the other book in this series, Before I Was Born for ages 5-8 and it was much more graphic and very distasteful (had intended it for my 7 year old, think it will be for the trash can instead). My children are raised without TV so maybe this book would be more appropriate for TV raised peers. I am open and honest when questions arise but I just don't think my little girl needs to know everything in this book. Wish I had been able to look at it before buying it. Definately won't be buying anymore from The God's Design For Sex Series without looking at one, first!"
4,Great content and Biblical view...confusing and long writing.,"The content of this book is excellent. Just the right amount of info and gentle phrasing. ""God took a tiny piece of Daddy's body and a tiny piece of Mommy's body and made you.""I only gave this book 4 stars because it is a very long read, especially for this age group. The writing is confusing at first. It is written like a dialog, but there is no ""he said, she said,"" Just a continual flow of text with no indication of who is speaking. Obviously you will read this to yourself before presenting it to your child, but I'd suggest reading it through several times, noting with a pencil ways to make the dialog more clear. Consider reading it in 2 or more chunks of time.In my experience, my children weren't ready for this book until about age 5, when they could really grasp the dialog and content. So we won't be moving on to the next book for a while."
5,Important for The Lord of the Rings,"Check out pages 140ff. of THE ROAD TO MIDDLE-EARTH by Tom Shippey for a discussion of how ""Boethian"" much of the treatment of evil is, in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred the Great(p. 141). He quotes some ""Boethian"" remarks from Frodo, Treebeard, and Elrond.There's real wisdom in the great tree of The Lord of the Rings, and here's one of the wells into which its roots were likely extended. When my students dig around those roots next year, Boethius's book will be prominent!"
3,Too formulaic,"The Socratic style of dialogue is always engaging, but the nonsensical syllogisms that are strung together get rather old and formulaic: (a) Make some very basic statement and get accordance; (b) Over extrapolate from the simple to an extremely complex nuanced case and gloss over the assumption; (c) Claim that 2+2=5; (d) Sing a, usually good, song."
2,dispensable,"I had been reading Platon, Cicero, Epicur, Marcus Antoninus, Seneca, Lucretius... for one year and then I chose Boethius to finish my ""studies"" in antique philosophy. His ""Concolation of Philosophy"" bored me like no other work before, since Boethius hardly does develop anything new (except the metaphysical studies about Predestination and Providence, which are already influenced by early Christianism). He more or less restricts himself to repeat mostly Platonic ideas, which are told to him by Lady Philosophy, who visits him in his prison in order to make him free of desperation.Some may feel consoled when they read this book. I didn't. I think the works of Cicero, Seneca and Marcus Antoninus are a much better help in case of depressiveness and desperation. For me, Boethius is just dispensable."
5,This is a must-read for pet owners.,"For anyone who has endured the experience of watching a dog or cat have a seizure this book can be a godsend. Not only does it provide helpful holistic strategies that really work--it's a one of a kind book. Pet owners who have pets prone to seizures are often left helpless. They don't know who to turn to. In result, they end up scared, frustrated and believe conventional medicine is the only solution. It's not. My book which provides wonderful strategies from top holistic vets nationwide offers aid to any pet owner who wants help and is willing to try a healthful, alternative route to lower the risk of seizures. I believe that my research and doctors' words of wisdom and expertise can and will help their beloved pets. For those who have an open mind and are willing to explore the vast world of alternative medicine this book may be the solution you're looking for."
1,After Some Research I Don't Trust Anything the Author Says,"I thought the book was fairly good. But, then I did some research about putting my dog on the natural dogfood he recommended. It has rosemary in it. Rosemary is contraindicated for dogs with seizures, and in fact can promote seizures in dogs prone to them. So, I no longer trust anything this author says, if he is so wrong about such an important piece of information."
5,Way Overpriced,This is a great book but this pricing must be a typo. You can get this book for $6.95 at Only Natural Pet's website online.
5,Fascinating and informative,"We purchased this series for our upper elementary aged son. He had been learning about space in school and his interest was sparked. He really enjoyed this series. I also found the series fascinating. I have watched most of the series and plan to watch the rest when they are returned to us. (He lent them to his teacher.) The theories presented regarding distant starlight, the uniqueness of the sun as a star, and the improbability of finding life in outer space are thought provoking and Biblical. In my opinion, this series is appropriate for upper elementary through adult age groups. Although our son does not completely understand all the information presented, there are enough rocket and space pictures to keep him interested. He will grow into the rest of the information."
4,Disapointment,The book is good but doesnt cover all models sold during 1990 and 1998. They should tell you what is not covered so you dont waste your time!
5,Clymer arctic cat snowmobile manual,Well packaged and delivered in a timely manner. Pleased with the book and glad to find one for that model year. Amazing how you can find anything you need on amazon.
2,No - If you're Interested in the Bounty,"I confess my main interest was reading about the Bounty mutineers and their life on this island. There is little of that in this book, and it may well be that not much more is known, but to me it was a disappointment. If you're solely interested in the history of this island - how it came to be formed, populated, what it's like there - then you will probably like this book. Also, though this may seem petty, the book is in an odd shape - quite large, and flimsy softcover - not easy to store on your library shelves (if you want to keep it, that is)."
5,Great Biography,"I have also read Remini's works on Jackson and Daniel Webster, this work on Clay may not have left me with the same impassioned feelings for those two men, but that is more a reflection on Clay's life than on Remini's work. Remini does a good job of bringing Clay to life, and left me with mostly positive feelings for the Great Compromiser. Although Clay's stubborn insistence that he was right to take the job of Secretary of State in 1825, still made me cringe (as I'm sure Remini did too) every time he brought it up. A fine use of primary sources, very readable and also scholarly, this is a great read."
1,"no index, no concept discussion, incomplete specification",That was enough to convince me to return it
2,Book has factual errors and important omissions,"This supplements prior review. Description of ARGV on page 328 is in error. $ARGV[0]is first argument on command line NOT the script name (as it would be in C). Also, I can find no description on use of backquotes in this manual. It looks nice, is generally well-organized, but incomplete and inaccurate."
3,"Incomplete as a ""complete"" reference","When I buy and read ""The Ultimate Resource for Perl 5 Professionals! The most complete, concise reference available..."", I expect the kind of detail that eliminates the need for additional Perl 5 reference books and the need to exhaustively test exactly how functions work. One simple example: gmtime takes a single date/time argument and returns 9 individual date and time variables, but this book doesn't provide details about the values returned in those variables. Is the month represented as 1 to 12, or 0 to 11, for example? It's up to the reader of the book to figure that out. Not hard to do, but it greatly diminishes the value of the book when that level of detail is not provided."
5,A great help in programming with PERL5,"In my work I do an enormous amount of PERL programming. We recently migrated from Perl4 to perl5. Had it not been for this text I would have spent MANY hours trying to sort through the updates and changes the new version brought about. With its easy to use CDROM and bled tabs for quick reference, this is a book is a must for anyone who programs with per"
4,Kenji is a great Bass guitarist,"This is another example of MUSIC BEING UNIVERSAL! This is where Musicianship is separated from Entertainers. Clearly, Kenji and his whole crew are expressing themselves through the language of music. There's no need for expensive music videos, rump shaking or anything else. It's all about the music here. I loved every moment of this album. For people that really love ALL MUSIC, then check this out. However if you're one of those people who SAY ""I love all music"" but in reality you just ""TOLERATE"" all music, then I don't know what to tell you.For Jazz lovers, music lovers, open-minded persons, This is a fine album that is very note-worthy and a great entry into your musical collection."
1,Solaray-Safflower capsules,"The EXACT thing happened to me this month! I also emailed them and was told it was backordered.Unfortunatley, I wasn't made aware of this problem while ordering. There are many other places to buy this product.If I had known the circumstances, I definitely would have gone elsewhere."
1,This is a rating for The Vitamin Shoppe,"I ordered this product from the Vitamin Shoppe on 01/04/12. I was informed the product was in stock and would be at my house before 01/12/12. I sent an e-mail to the Vitamin Shoppe on the 12th to find out that the product was not even in stock, and I wouldn't be able to receive it for a few more weeks (IF it was available then). I don't understand why they didn't inform me when I placed my order. I could have saved everyone the trouble and ordered from someone else. I will not purchase anything from the Vitamin Shoppe again!"
3,"NO LOSS OF BELLY FAT YET, LIKE IT CLAIMS","I BOUGHT THIS SAFFLOWER OIL SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE I HEARD ABOUT ALL THE CLAIMS THAT IT CAN HELP YOU LOSE BELLY FAT WEEKLY. WELL, IT HAS'NT FOR ME YET! I'VE BEEN ON IT OVER A WEEK AND I HAVE'NT LOST ANYTHING YET. I KNOW DR.OZ & MONTELL WILLIAMS STATED ON HIS SHOW THAT IT HELPS THEM LOSE BODY FAT WEEKLY BUT IT'S NOT WORKING. I GUESS IT'S JUST ANOTHER GIMMICK TO THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY ON. SO GOODLUCK IF YOU PURCHASE IT, I HOPE IT WORKS FOR YOU!"
1,slow,Never said it wasnt in stock took 2 weeks to get it now will see if it works Emailed them then they says due to the responce of the dr oz show they are out of stock will ship when recieve to sorry
4,it worked !!!!!,I ordered the safflower and I lost more weight than belly fat but i did lose some belly fat. I exercised and walked 4 days a week and I did situps. I lost 35 pounds so far in 5 months and I changed my eating habits.
5,The Blue Flame,"I enjoyed The Blue Flame very much. It is the first fantasy novel I have read. Along with the characters we learn of magic, and how it must be controlled. I highly recommend the book. It is fast paced and once you start reading you do not want to put it down. The Blue Flame would make an outstanding movie."
5,Fantasy Favorite,"THE BLUE FLAME is an excellent book in its genre, withbelievable characters and interesting dialog. The movingplot and realistic descriptions keep the reader intent onknowing more. I am eagerly anticipating the coming sequel,THE EMERALD DAGGER."
3,Great for Teachers of Toddlers,I am a stay at home Mom and didn't find the books useful. If I was a teacher it would be great. I was looking for activities to do with my child but it is mostly activities that can be done in a classroom.
3,Ok,"This book is good if you are looking for toddler activities. Lots of activites are presented for different toddler ages and abilities. The activities range from simple to difficult as far as the materials the ""teacher"" has to put together. (You do not need the second book, More Toddlers Together; the 2 together is overkill.) This book seems geared towards small child care centers, but a lot of it works for only 1 child."
3,Could do with more of some and none of the others,"I purchased this product to add the decorations to my Valentine's Day cupcakes. I admit that I knew upfront what I was purchasing, I prefered to have more of the Valentine theme toppings in pink, red and white and hearts and not the lilac sugar crystals, per se."
2,Almost realistic,"What happened to the Rothschilds in this story? They practically financed the entire Scramble for Africa! What happened to showing Mr. Rhodes setting up the Round Table that according to Carroll Quigley took over the world as the ""New World Order""? The BBC always takes away the good stuff. Too Bad!"
2,Raving socialist propaganda,Spring is clearly a raving socialist. He provides a good picture of the mechanics of educational policy but from a very liberal perspective. He uses numerous illustrations which leave no doubt about his political position. The book has several false remarks about conservative leaders that border on libel. It is a shame that he couldn't put his biases aside and write a good book.
5,Perfect Fit,Installed both right and left EMGO mufflers on my 1971 BMW R75/5 to replace dented and rusted originals. The EMGO mufflers are exact duplicates of the original and installation was simple. Everything fit perfectly. The chrome plating looks great and the mufflers sound fine.
1,Fiction or Not - this book is NOT funny to the Dyslexic,"I was not thrilled at all with this book. Yes, it has a humorous spin on an eccentric Vicar. But, I can tell you now, the LAST thing a dyslexic needs to read or hear about is inaccuracies about their dyslexic struggles. I know that my son would much rather people UNDERSTAND his dyslexia then laugh at it. Just because it isn't a disability that can be seen doesn't mean it isn't a real issue for a child. I caution teachers that may feel lead to read this in a classroom setting. With 15-20% of the population struggling with this learning disability, there will be a few kids that won't find it so humorous."
2,Disappointing,"This book is told largely in flashbacks, which makes it very disjointed. We are given little indication why the characters love each other and shown little of their early interactions. Especially disappointing is the fact that it all takes place in the usual setting, London -- we only get to see the heroine's nursing experiences in the flashbacks. And too much of the story is spent setting up her friends' romances for future books.The book is full of anachronisms and romance-novel cliches. If you want a story about real Victorian life and attitudes, don't look here. However, I am giving the book two stars because there are flashes of potential. This could be a good writer if she did more research and was more original."
4,Amazon Earmuff Sound Protection,"These earmuffs are well made, easy to install, provide good protection. Unfortunately, the helmet that I originally purchased these for, already have a face shield plugged into the helmet slots. These earmuffs are great if you don't have the helmet slots used for something else."
4,"Excellent, Even Brilliant Indie Pop","VanGaalen is a Calgary based illustrator/animator/musician who recorded the 15 songs that make up ""Skelliconnection"" in his basement studio at home. This is by no means a lo-fi recording, though. Instead, it's a beautifully produced, stylistically diverse album that sounds like a collaboration between Devendra Banhart, Beck and the Moldy Peaches. Standout tracks include the rocker ""Flower Garden,"" ""Red Hot Drops,"" ""See-Thru-Skin,"" ""Dead Ends,"" and the lullaby-like ""Sing Me 2 Sleep."" This has to be one of the best indie releases this year, and one of the best albums of the year, period."
4,Crudly realistic,"Very realistic tips. Even on usually avoided subjects as the ""biting testicles"" option that I had to use last year when a man tried to force me to oral sex after getting the idea from a self defense class and praticing with my husband (not real force used). That seams obvious but it's not easy to performe. Real options for a real danger is what we need."
3,good,funny but not one of his best. own all of the bob rivers christmas cds so now i decided to try the others. a little dissapointed. there are a few gems here but overall a dissappointment.
3,Bob Rivers Low Expectations,"This album is not as well done as the other Bob Rivers albums. Perhaps it is just me, but I expected more."
1,Nady E03 Wireless in-Ear Personal Monitor waste of money,"That was a complete waste of my time and money. I am glad Amazon takes returns. This product is of the poorest quality and craftsmanship. The ear buds are the lowest quality ear phones I have ever used. The system doesn't push enough sound to the ear phones to be heard over even a light conversation in the room let alone instruments or drums. I usually don't write reviews on products, but felt compelled to warn anyone else to not be cheap. Baseline is a Pure in-ear system and that is about $599. Sorry to have to that conclusion, but if I want to protect my ears and hear myself more clearly I will need to spend more than twice what I paid for this system. Be warned."
1,bracelet,"The heart on the bracelet came off after the second day of wear. I do not recommend the product, but the delivery and service were done well."
1,"""Before the First Wave - - 3rd Armored Amphibious Battalion""","I am WW II veteran of 3rd Armored Division and am curious to read this book because I was unaware that the Division had an amphibious battalion. The bulk of the Division landed, I believe on around June 12th, 6 days after D-Day. I will withold final judgement until I can read the book."
1,informative,thought the book was very informative and at a reasonable price-service was quick. book was not too long or boreing--have friends who are dealing with cancer and thought this book would help--it did help on how to talk to them--thanks
5,Tough stuff,"I run 30+ Rods on my charter boat, The Rodfather. Every single rod has flurocarbon, and I like Seaguar the best. Not only does stand up to abuse, it appears significantly smaller in diameter to other brands. While other boats may switch to 30# mono in the fall for the cost and strength, this flourocarbon can take the beating of the large King Salmon we catch in Michigan City."

4,More George Canyon is a good thing,"This is a terrific cd by one of my favorite singers. I just wish it were available in the US. Just to correct an error by a previous reviewer - George Canyon was not the first Nashville Star winner...that was Buddy Jewell. George was the runner-up in season two of Nashville Star. He lost out to Brad Cotter which was a shame since George was the better singer/performer. Anyway, I highly recommend George's music. He's a talented as well as genuinely nice man."
3,Informative,"I found the book to be well researched, and informative. My only criticism is that the sentences are a little long winded, making the mind lose focus at times. However, you do come away with valuable knowledge on the life and journey of Soto, and I do recommend it to someone seeking the subject matter."
4,Great one volume coverage on PACS,"One of the few available books on PACS. Highly recommended for people who want to study PACS based on one book, instead of going all out to read lots of academic papers. Cover all major concepts. Sort of expensive, though."
5,Milhaud from the Source,"The Dutton label has done a wonderful service to the classical music buying public by making available historical recordings of composers conducting or performing their own works -- first Prokofiev, Strauss and Lehar (see my review of the latter), and now Darius Milhaud. These performances are of surprisingly good recording quality considering that four selections hail from the late 1940s and the other two from the mid-1930s. (There are actually two performances of the Concertino de Printemps featured here, one from 1933 and the other from 1949.) Because these are mono recordings, serious Milhaud fans will probably want to find other CDs in stereo. However, those same Milhaud fans would be remiss in not getting renditions directly from the source."
5,Brute Tough Aqua Blue,"My whole life (at least the past 28 years) has been spent in the housing industry as a carpenter. I've done everything from footings to ridge cap, that could be described as carpentry. In my career I've abused, misused, torn up, and wore out more tools than most people will ever own in their lives. I'll be the first to admit it, I am very hard on tools.I purchased a cordless tool combo-kit of the 18-volt aqua blue variety in the late summer of 2006. The bag contained a quick 30 minute charger, two 2.4 amp/hr batteries, sawzall, circular saw, flashlight, drill, and a jigsaw. I took it home and fully charged the batteries as the manufacturer recommended. Within a couple of days I had to drive approximatly 1,500 3"" screws in treated lumber. My new aqua blue drill performed this task with room to spare, something that would have sucked the blood out of my old yellow drill. As of this writing I have no complaints about my aqua blue tools, and would recommend them to everyone."
1,Witches do not believe in the devil or satan .,if you do you study work you will know that the christians are the ones who turned the horned God into the devil to get people to fear the Pagan religion.Otherwise known as witchcraft
4,Good Mid to Entry Level Welding Book,"As the previous reviewer said this book is laid out like text book, but, if you are looking for basic to intermediate information about the MIG and TIG welding processes you will find plenty of useful information that is easy to find and understand."
1,TIG & MIG Welding,"Look at the price of this product! If you believe that you get what you pay for in this world, this book is not for you. It's just too light in useful information on TIG welding. It's totally outdated with photos of antiquated machines and it gives little information on the techniques of TIG welding. In essence it reads like an introduction to TIG welding with only 77 pages (many of which consist of test questions) dedicated to this subject. Even used at $34, it offers less insights than the free information you can find online. Yes, it's a good introduction to TIG, but no, it's not worth the cheapest price you will buy it for. Keep hunting for something better."
2,Basic Tig and Mig Welding: GTAW and GMAW,Product was grossly overpriced for its content ans I was disappointed that it didn't go into the detail I expected for a book costing as much as this one.
2,"OK for a rank beginner, but lacking","This is OK for someone that wants a fast spotter's guide to the kinds of aircraft you will see around Southern California, but I would have appreciated something more geographical; what planes are you likely to see where and what places are good to see warplanes from. It's good, not as confusing as Janes' guide, but kind of disappointing."
1,iPhone headset output to usb,Product did not work. Would not deal with this vendor again. One star given by mistake. My usual dealings with amazon are perfect.
