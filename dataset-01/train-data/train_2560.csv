5,Hilarious!!!,I loved it!! Although I think that you have to be in the airline industry to really get some of the references...I think it is a good laugh for everyone. I LOVE PAM ANN!!!
1,Europe loves her but....,"....I'm so disappointed! The tube was filled with raves about this show and I was very interested in seeing it. The London daily papers gave the live show rave reviews, also. Am totally disappointed. The ""acting"" isn't good and she simply isn't funny. I don't think this is because I'm not a frequent flyer...I have been in London, Austin, Chicago and more within the past year. I don't think it's because I'm not gay, either! Just isn't funny."
2,good taste but....,I woke up made me a shake (which tasted great) and about ten minutes later I had some serious gastrointestinal problems.
4,Worked Great,"My son is a HS Freshman, LB/TE was 145 1 month ago now he is 160lb the shake combined with workouts 3 days a week, he says its good, and has no side affects, about to order 2 more containers. I highly reccomend this product."
4,Is that... POO?,"I recommend using a blender with this product. Since I don't have one, that leaves me with a couple other options-shakin,' and stirrin.' I don't think stirrin' would work too well with this powder, so I use the former. After which, there are STILL clumps floatin' around in my shake (and I only use half a serving/two scoops).On the positive side, this stuff tastes great! Add a little peanut butter, and I feel like I'm drinking a brownie! I think it uses artifical sweeteners though, and lots of em.' Not sure if I gained any weight either, since I stpped at one container."
3,Champion Nutrition,"It gives you the 900 calories with milk/4 scoops.I gave it 3 stars for the artificial sweeteners but, other than that, go for it."
3,The Real Deal,"What else can i say? It does what it does, this is all i use along with a creatine mono-hydrate and Ive gained 6 pounds in 2 months...mix with milk to up the protein dosage, with milk it's about a 50 gram protein shake, taken 2 times daily with 4 to 5 meals a day is perfect, makes buying whey protein almost pointless if you can get this amount of calories and protein in 1 shake. 4 scoops may seem like a lot but the scoops are not that large. 1 7 pound tub lasts me up to 3 weeks....the reason i am giving it 3 stars is because of the extremely poor packaging, it was cracked and powder was all over the place, it was ridiculous"
5,Check Out Virgin Coconut Oil,"The manufacture is correct. It is a terrific substitute for certain oil products for baking and some fried foods. But, did you know that there is another use for Coconut Oil? It is wonderful on dry skin. I am brown skinned and spend a great deal of time out doors and in water. I have developed very dry/ashy skin. I have sent this product to to at least 8 others who have the same complaint and we all agree we no longer have this problem. Because it is not a cosmetic there is no overt Coconut smell (after smell). When first applied there is a soft oil sheen that after absorption disappears leaving a natural skin tone. No more embarrassingly ashy parts. Who would have thought?"
3,Doesn't smell coconutty,I love coconut oil and use it on hair and body and in lotions and lipgloss and occasionally even cook with it. But I like the Nutivia oil better becasue it actually smells like toasted coconut. That is really the only reason for the preference for me! But this I have had and the consistency and texture are perfect.
5,Great Coconut oil,This is the best coconut oil I've tried. The price is right and it is an excellent product. My good cholesterol has gotten much higher and even my doctor noted that. It tastes good in oatmeal and I use it in my coffee also. It's just good for you and tastes good too.
5,Probably not smart to order in the summertime,"I love this product and have been ordering it for several months. Just got my latest order and the contents were melted and it had leaked all over the box. Not a big deal, but it was super messy and we lost some contents of the jar. Try and order during the cold months and not when it sits in the 90 degree weather in ups trucks."
4,$8.97 for 16 ounces?,27 cents per ounce would make the 16 ounce container $4.32. $0.41 per ounce would make the 32 ounce container $13.12. Why does the price per ounce increase for the 32 ounce container?
3,"LOVE THE COCONUT OIL, HATE THE GLASS CONTAINER!","When it arrived, the glass container was broken. I had to get the coconut oil in another container. So some of the coconut oil were wasted since I didn't want to risk my luck getting hurt with glass in some coconut oil. I love the oil though. It smelled great! It penetrated in my hair well & it made it softer. I have natural 4a hair."
3,Don't know what all the fuss is about,"Got two of these, because the hype on it was so glowing. I haven't used it much yet, but I can't see why it's so much better than other oils, except it is a lovely ointment for sunburn."
4,Noah's first novel is a keeper,"Being a Boomer, I generally don't much relate to stories of Generation X existential angst. However, I found Noah's book delightfully readable and I found I took a genuine interest in his multi-faceted characters quickly. His portraits were compelling, believable, and engaging. I found that in this tale of interwoven lives, I ultimately cared what happened to each one. Well written - - I eagerly await your next effort!"
4,A recipe for a good read!,The characters lives are interlaced like the ingredients in the various mouthwatering dishes that are devoured throughout the novel. A recipe for a good read!
3,Clock Radio,"It's a decent clock radio for the price, but I wish the second alarm function was radio capable and not just a beep."
3,"Niced radio, but...","Radio is very nice, but has two drawbacks that should be considered. You cannot set both alarm 1 and 2 to ""alarm mode"" One must be on ""radio"", and the other on ""alarm""Also The alarm buzzer is not very loud. A volume control would be nice."
5,A Must Read for All Interested in the Indian Worldview!,"This provocative book brings forth historical, spiritual, and cultural concepts that have been at the heart of the India since 2000 B.C. By looking to the Vedas, Gupta deconstructs difficult concepts and gracefully explains them in a manner which helps the reader understand the Indian worldview. By exploring the concepts of dharma, karma, and moksha, Gupta brings forth the core values inherent in Indian societies. The need for educating their children, respecting elders, and consistently putting the ""other"" before the ""self"". Dr. Gupta provides a window into the world of Indian-ness. This book is not only for teachers...but for anyone looking to explore the unknown terrain of Indian-ness."
5,FINALLY!,Finally Jake and Cassie.....can't tell you! But I was soooo HAPPY! It's a very good story with many twists and turns about the reason the Ellimist has called them. But of course the Animorphs figure it out. Watch out for Rachel's new do....
5,"All-powerful Ellimist? Yeah, right!","The Animorphs thought the Ellimist was all-powerful. But he's got this enemy: The Crayak. Now the Ellimist and the Crayak are fighting over what's going to happen to the Iskroot: but they're not fighting themselves. They've each chosen seven fighters. The Crayak has chosen seven Howlers, the deadly species that destroyed the Pemalites. And the Ellimist has chosen the Animorphs, Ax, and Erek the Chee. This book is a definite must-read! It's full of action, comedy, and even a couple of surprises here and there. Even a non-Animorph fan will enjoy it!"
5,Awsome!,This is the best Jake book ever! He morphs tiger on the front cover! They destroy a lot of the yeerks. This could be a very crucial book in the series.
3,"TEEWwwwww, the books are getting lousy...","The only thing that keeps me reading these books is the humor and because I want to know if anyone dies. Even if it is all very realistic, by now somebody should be dead. They can't always be lucky. And the same plot. The yeerks have a plan! And this time, the Animorphs may fail and Earth will be lost... And they escape!! Whoopee, sneak preview of the next book... The books are, for the most part, spiraling down, down..."
5,THE BEST ANIMORPH BOOK EVER WRITTEN!,This is the best plot out of all the Animorph books.And it probaly took alot of planning because Jake sees the Crayak in book #6.It also talks about the Yeerks called Yoorts this is a must read!
5,couldn't put it down!,"This book was very exciting. It is about the animorphs. They have met up with the elemist, yet again. The elemist has an ever going match for power with an alien named Crayek. If you have read the book, The capture, this is the thing that Jake sees as the Yeerk dies and falls out of his ear. The Crayek has a group of aliens called howlers, that he has created. The elemist picks the animorphs, plus erik to go to an alien planet and fight the Howlers. here's the deal, the howlers have wiped out tons of sentinent creatures, including the androids' creators, the chee. in this battle niether team is allowed to kill any of the alien race living on the planet. Will the animorphs beat the very destructive howlers? to find out read The Attack."

2,Doesn't look like picture,Don't get this expecting the picture. It is actually a little darker with stringy curls. If you just need cheap pink wig then you may like it.
1,Worthless,"I purchased this item off of another website and sent it back the day after it arrived. (At least the Philips model will work for a couple of weeks.) This unit will only record programs off the air. You CANNOT record anything from your VCR, and this has nothing to do with copy protection. This unit will not allow you to convert your VHS tapes to DVD. There is even a flyer inside the box proudly touting this little defect. So in other words, I quickly found that the DRX9000 only does half of what a DVD recorder should do. If you're assuming that it must at least do that much well, you're wrong. It has an intolerable synchronization problem. For example, when you play back a disc, you see an actor's lips moving and hear what he says about 2 seconds later. Garbage."
1,No Thanks,"It completley quit working after month. no power, no menu, no anything. I was able to return it to the retail store. I used the money towards a Philips DVD burner."
2,Power supply issues.,"Let me first start off by saying that I like my other Apex DVD players. They are cheap, and do a good job playing DVDs. However, I have 2 of these and both of them have died due to the powersupply. I got the first one and it did fine until IC2 on the power supply blew about 1 and 1/2 years after I bought it. So I got another one thinking it was just a one time issue. That one lasted about 3 months and then went dark. I would not suggest this product to anyone. It is worth about 3-6 months of DVD viewing/recording and then poof... dead. I'm currently in the process of contacting Apex to see if they will provide me some wiring diagrams so I know what voltages go where. Then I'll connect some small PC power supplies to my 2 units and they should then be fine."
1,One of the worst electronics products I have encountered,"I usually am more subtle in my reviews, but I want to say upfront: do *not* buy this DVD recorder.The user interface is extremely unintuitive and confusing. Even when you do figure it out, you'll still find yourself wanting to scream - and I mean scream - when the machine starts flashing the word ""invalid"" in the middle of everything you try to do.Even after you learn to suffer through, you'll find that the machine frequently forgets all of your settings anyway. How can you schedule your recordings if the machine forgets the settings? You can't. We heard that due to a glitch if you want to keep your settings you cannot actually turn off the machine. So we tried that, too. It still forgot our settings anyway.After returning the first unit, we tried another. We encountered the same issues which make the unit completely unusable."
1,Dead Machine,"I wrote a previous rating on this giving it a medium rating. Not this time. Woke up to a totally dead machine. No indication, no power on, no eject, nothing. What really bums me is that it has one of my dvds hostage and I can't get it to give it up. In contact with APEX but don't see anyway to get it out. Tried unplugging and then plugging back in about an hour later. No good. Fortunately still under warrenty. Only had it a month."
2,Don't waste your money,"As all the others, my power supply just died as well. They wanted $99 for me to fix this inferior product.Stay clear"
1,Throwing good money after bad!,"There is a major known issue with this machine. It seems that the capacitors for the power supply are nothing but trash. Many people are having problems with these units not powering up after about 90 days or so. Apex will repair the unit, but you have to call them, wait on hold for over an hour (long distance I might add) then pay to ship it to them, and pay for labor if its more than 90 days from purchase. My advise, run away from this machine as fast as you can."
1,I've had it with this unit!,"Purchased the unit about 3 months ago, plugged it in and was able to start playing a DVD. Within a couple of minutes, the whole thing went dead and would not power back up. And my DVD was still inside! Sent the unit back to Apex at my expense and could not check up on the status via their website, nor with phone calls. Finally, about 6 weeks later, they shipped it back to me in my same packaging and stuffings (a DELL monitor box, no doubt!), yet not one word or message within the box to let me know what was going on. So far, the unit is now playing DVD's, but I have YET to get it to format a disc in preparation to use, thereby rendering this unit useless. Apex should give up on anything other than cheap TV's, VCR's and DVD players."
3,Agree,"I agree with gr. Losing all your settings shows lack of foresight of the developers of this machine. I was going to contact Apex about this, but you answered my questions. Still, a good machine for the money, and once the firmware was upgraded, the instability on the VHS input went away."
1,DRX 9000 is the biggest joke of all DVD recorders,"About 2 months ago I an Apex DVD Recorder DRX 9000 off ebay and was very excited because now I can transfer my tapes to DVDs. When I got it I tried it out. Recording from TV signals the quality was great. I tried it from a video signal it was lousy due to Macrovision copyright. So I called Apex for an upgrade CD to removed the Macrovision which did. When I recorded from the video signal the quality was wasn't the best but decent. The video signal recording was working until after 2 days when I tried it again it kept pausing and said 'paused by copy protection which means the CD didn't do any good. (...). I went ahead a much excellent recorder a Panasonic DMR-E20 which records from video signals perfectly. Whoever gave this machine a 5 star rating, what are you thinking? At was wondering why people was knocking it here but when I tried it out I see why."
1,I was so excited to get this and then so disappointed!,"I was greatly looking forward to getting this DVD recorder. I thoroughly researched the category and thought Apex had an outstanding price.Only one problem. This DVD recorder is awful. It has a terrible menu system and remote control. The recorder had a lot of problems and I could never get Apex on the phone. I returned it.There was one positive, though. When the machine did actually record a DVD properly, the picture quality was excellent."
3,For Diehard Scooter Fans Only,"Storm Scooters shows all of the basics of riding a scooter- speed, braking, tricks, and acceleration. But I'd only suggest this DVD for big scooter fans. While it shows many scooters tricks, including wheelies and off-road riding, I think that only heavy scooter junkies such as myself would enjoy this DVD. While watching, I learned several new tricks that I have tried on my own scooter. But if you just want to watch this movie and you're not crazy about scooters, stay away from it."
5,Excellent video,"If you want to knit a sweater from top to bottom, this is the right video. Ninah has a wonderful skill to explain techniques/instructions and takes away the 'fear' of knitting. I am already knitting my sweater and I hope she has more videos about this way to knit sweaters. You won't regret your purchase."
4,It's a little confusing,"I think this was a pretty good book, but while reading it, you expect it to tie in with Tamora Pierce's other books somehow. It would be nice to have some familiar characters from previous books drop in once and a while. If this was the first of Tamora Pierce's books that I'd read, I'd probably give it an 8 or 9. You wonder why it's called Sandry's Book. I mean, all she does is hold everyone together. It's not like she has an awesome type of magic. This book seems like it's centered more on Tris than anybody else. It also jumps around from one character to another so much, it's hard to tell who they're talking about. This was a great book, though, so don't think it's really bad or anything. It's just that from reading Tamora Pierce's other books, I expected it to be better."
3,"A rather imaginative text, but I MISS TORTALL!!!","It would have been better if it had taken place in familar surroudings, like Tortall =0). It would have been interesting to know what happened to Numair and Daine. It lacks the wit and charm that the Alanna and Daine series has, but nonetheless, it has a certain appeal that has me waiting for the next book."
3,"It's quite a fine book , but I MISS TORTALL!!!","The book is considerably fine, but it does not live up to its predecessors, such as the Immortals series and The Song Of The Lioness. Still, it does have a unique plot"
2,Coulda Done Better,"I love Tamora Pierce. She's my favorite author, mainly because she's talented, makes amazing charcters, and even better plots. So I was pretty surprised when I got this book. I guess you could say I was dissapointed. I found it hard to follow, and the plot wasn't all that great, although the main idea of magic was good. I would suggest maybe checking the book out, instead of buying it. Don't give up on the series, though; book 2 & 3 are way better. But if you want a good Pierce series, get Song of the Lioness or Immortals."
1,"If you read her other books, you shouldn't read this one.","I was very dissapointed. I loved the Alanna series, and I thought the Immortals was pretty good, but there's no getting around it: THIS ONE S**KS. It's not the different setting I object to. And the plethora of main characters is only moderatly bad. It's mostly her writing style itself that dissapoints me. In this series the characters are flat, the descriptions are uncolrful, and the character development obvious. It's not the worst series in the world, but it can't come close to the firey, facsinating world of the Song of the Lioness.P.S.Don't lose all hope, I just read her newest book, Protector of the Small. It seems to have potential."
3,A real let-down,"The book was OK. If this is the first of Ms. Pierce's books that you have read, you would probably like it better, but the book was a definite let-down if you had read her other books. I think that after she has completed this series, she should go back to writing about Tortall. That really worked for her."
3,"I want Tortall! And Jonthan, Daine, George, and everyone",It's was ok but it need Tamora's exicitement to hold it up like i don't like Tris and she's the one with all the power and everything. After all was is Threacraft good for?
5,a great book like all of her others,i just finished reading this book. i have read all of her series and loved them also. the way she writes invites you to use your imagination and get into what you are reading. i could actually fell the wind around me i got so into this book. when they were trapped in the cave under the coal and rocks and sandry spun their magic. it makes u want to jump in and help them. i loved this book.
2,A Little Disappointing,"I agree with some of the other readers, this book was quite a disappointment. In her other stories, Tamora Pierce wove together an enchanting web of romance, adventure, wit and magic. Unlike her previous books, this series didn't allow time for the reader to 'get acquainted' with a single character. Instead, it switched fomr here to there and gave a bit of information on each...but it was hardly enough for me to really get interested. I missed Tortall too, but that's not why I didn't like it. It simply didn't compare to the excellent books she wrote before! It wasn't 'trash,' but it wasn't a hit either."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the GOOD books by Tamora Pierce, this one was a disappointment. It wasn't so much that Ms. Pierce moved from a different world (though I hope that this won't be the end of Tortall), but this book just didn't have the feeling of intamacy surrounding the characters as Ms. Pierce's Tortall series. I think it may have been because she was trying to shove in all these main characters with different backgrounds and powers, instead of focusing on one strong character. However, if this is a first time reading of Ms. Pierce's work, perhaps you will be more forgiving, having no comparison to her better novels."
3,"I agree, GIVE US TORTALL!!!!!!!!!!","I have read (and own) all of the books in the Lioness and Imortals series and this book was SUCH a let-down, I mean, come on, SANDRY's book!!??? The whole thing was about Tris. Puh-lease. Still this book had its merits. However, in conclusion, I must agree with my fellow reviewers in saying...... I WANT DAINE,NUMAIR, ALANNA, JONATHAN, THAYET etc., and most of all- TORTALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A opion,In the beginning it was very hard to follow this book. I felt that the author could have done a better job. After the first one-hundred pages of introductory and confusion this book begins to improve. The characters begin to have depth and there starts to have a point to the story. All in all I think that I would wait to buy it in paperback.
3,"Okay, but not really what I'm looking for","First of all, I think we should give Tamora Pierce a break on her sudden world switch. She's entitled to a change after eight books, wouldn't you think?! But still, four characters is a little extreme for just one story. I'd rather focus on one main character than know very little about a group. Also I never got as close to Sandry, or Tris, or Daja or Briar than I did to Daine or Alanna. In order to be able to relate to a character, you have to know them a little better then we know the Circle of Magic crew. It wasn't horrendous, but it could sure use some work."
1,I was disappointed. I WANT TORTALL BACK!!!!!!!@!!!,"Okay, I was really siked, since I LOVED the Immortals and the Song of the Lioness. However, imagine my disappointment when I found that there was NO Tortall in this book. I read it, however. I disliked it. I read the next one even, maybe the first one had been a fluke. Nope. The second one was no better. I have heard that there will be a Protector of the Small series with Tortall (Yea!!!) as the setting. I'm hoping that these will be better. I want to say I respect everyones opinion on this book, however."
2,I MISS TORTALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I want some familiar faces back! I miss Allana,(she rocks) Daine,(she does to) Numair, Jonathan, George, etc. This book was okay, but I'll say this again, I WANT MORE TORTALL BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Glittery and shallow, rather disappointing","Tamora Pierce's books are always entertaining. For light reading, they may even be good. But, on the whole, I find her books very disappointing. No conflicts! The Magic series, from what I've read of it, seems to be based entirely on the idea that there are two kinds of people--those who never seriously quarrel and those who do. The quarreling side attacks the other and is thwarted. Is that any way to write a book? The fight always goes to her heros, and their emotions run about two inches deep--not at all stirring or leaving you wishing it hadn't ended. I read her Alanna series. Again, entertaining, but I thought it had to much adult subject matter. The plots and settings are basically fine--it's only the characters who need polishing. Monica Furlong--now there's an author. That woman can write!! Thanks for having a review option."
3,Just keep reading,don't let the begenning bore you! The ending is a blast! I think its the start of a new circle frendship!
3,Okay but...,"You've heard it before. I want TORTALL. I didn't really mind the new characters, weak as they may be, but it would have been great to tie in the familliar characters from Tortall. And what was with the title? Sandry's book? If it was about anyone it was about Tris, an unlikeable character who liked to make herself a victim! I was confused."
5,"wonderful, but i want tortall!","the book was just lovely, and I even enjoyed the point of view switchings, but I miss Allana and Daiene. (And King Johnothan, George, and Numiar)"
4,"not bad, not the best","I thought this book was ok. It isn't as good as The Immortals though. One thing I like about it is that it has four main characters and not one. I also like that it is in a different place, although I keep expecting Daine or someone to pop up. On thing I don't like about the book is the way it skips around from character to character. I see the title ""Sandry's Book"" and expect it to be from her point of veiw only. It is kind of confusing when it switches around so much. But over all it is a really good book and I can't wait for the next one."
5,New friends in a new world...,"Sandry, Daja, Tris, and Briar are all brought to Winding Circle Temple to learn the ways of their strange magic. A lady, a Trader, a cast-off and a theif, they distrust each other until they are trapped together and must combine their powers to escape. I would not have known Tamora Pierce had written this if not for her name on the cover. My opinion is that it needs to pick up the pace."
2,Yaaaaaawwwn,"This is my first Tamora Pierce book...and probably my last. It starts out great. A shipwreck. A trial. Mysterious weather patterns. And a hopelessly trapped girl. But chapter by chapter the book get more and more boring. The conflict starts to feel tacked on instead of exciting. And I swear that half of this book is about the main characters learning proper meditation techniques. Now I don't need all my fantasy to have epic battle against evil overlords, but I need some conflict. Even what slim inner conflicts the characters have in treated with the depth of a puppet show, and the social interactions are no better.Read the first chapter. Maybe the second. Then stop. There's nothing worth reading after that."
4,Pretty good.,"I thought that this book was pretty good, but not as good as other books Tamora Pierce has written.Tamora Pierce is a great author, and I, for the most part, LOVE her books. This one did prove to be a little disappointing. It's got some cool magic and everything, but it wasn't as exciting as Alanna or Daine."
5,Get off Tortall!!!!!,"I must say most of you lot are a bunch of wet puppies. Look at Anne McCaffrey, what, about 10 worlds? And here you are, griping about Tamora Pierce because she wanted to create another world! Do you expect her to stick to Tortall for the rest of her life? If i was her I'd give you all a punch in the nose! And what do you mean, Sandry, *only* ties them all together? ONLY!!! Get off the grass you lot and enjoy the new series for what it is!!Anyway a great book."
1,Daniel Green Slipper,This slipper is so stiff I can not walk in it. The sole is unbending and the upper portion cuts into my foot. Daniel Green was my favorite slipper years ago. No more. Their quality has completely deteriorated.
1,"I hate these shoes, they hurt my feet","While initially seeming comfortable, after being worn for about an hour these started really hurting my feet around the open toe area. It's not finished well around the opening. After about 2 hours these were complete torture to wear. And I was at work and had to ride the subway home still with them on."
1,talk about beatles,"i do not care for this dvd.all it is about is people remminising about the times they were with them. no actual taped footage of the beatles or them themselves speaking.up close and personal is just a title to get you to buy the product, its a farse, its false advertising like so many things now days."
5,This is a great program,This is a great program I use it to make many flow charts both for my business and as a freelancer for others.
5,Love them. <3,I love these panels. I bought them for walls in my booth at a craft show. They work very well. I can pin things to the fabric and hang things from the top. Easy to take apart for storage. Easy to put together. Love the fabric on them (textured). Works very well for what I intended them to do. There is a small gap between them like other had said. Not complete privacy.
4,Nice Product,Very Nice Product. I am using it in a large living room as a room separator. Looks very nice and stands well. The only thing that could be improved in the one I received was that there were a couple of loose threads sticking out. Do not want to touch them in case it could damage it later on. I would definitely recommend it and received it for a good price. Very easy to assemble. Anyone could do it in 15 minutes. Shipped within the time expected.
1,USELESS,"Rec'd no hardware and the thing is so bulky and packed like it's going into a war zone.. it's a pain to return. I wish there was an option for customer service.. I just want the hardware, so I can assemble this.. I think it's very cool."
4,Better than expected,"I love this divider. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because the plastic caps for the feet come off easily. If your floor is level, that won't happen. I'm using this in a room that was an outdoor patio, now an enclosed patio, and apparently the floor isn't a little off.I would recommend this to friends."
4,Very nice!,"I read the other reviews before I purchased this, so I was aware about the 3"" or so gap in between each screen. But the cloth is so much nicer than the other ""rice paper"" screens. The scrolling at the top dresses it up as well. Put it in front of our side window so we don't have to see the neighbors ugly garbage cans. Really does the trick. Blocks the bad scenery but lets the light through. I do recommend this."
1,Customer service review,"Very poor quality product. Company with low standards customer service: shipped the wrong item, return process is obscure and inconvenient. Still waiting for my refund, 2nd week after returning the item."
5,pure genius,"A work of pure genius...it's as simple as that. The Dukes (or XTC) were never able to match this EP again. The idea to record a series of songs designed to sound like other bands is much harder than it sounds. Partridge and co. manage it wonderfully here.The instrumentation, vocals and songs themselves sound like they were dredged up from a second-hand bin in a San Franciscan pyschedelic record store. The attention to detail with the vocal effects and background sound effects is wonderful, it sounds as though a lot of thought, time and talent went into recording this. The band were clearly inspired and, somewhat surprisingly, clean and sober from what I remember reading at the time.The extras are good but not neccessary. The demos are on Fuzzy Warbles, the other tracks don't quite measure up to the original songs on the EP itself.For me, this album stands out as a piece of art, deliberately dated yet timeless at once. Weird and certainly wonderful."
5,Michelin 2006 Road Atlas: USA-Canada-Mexico (Michelin Road Atlas),"Living in the UK I have travelled tens of thousands of miles across Europe during the past 30 years or more, always using Michelin road atlases. When it came to a two month, 6000 mile plus driving vacation in the USA covering 9 states, I was delighted to discover that one was available for there. True to form the Michelin atlas didn't let me down.I also had a Rand McNally road atlas which I rarely used. Michelin knocks spots off Rand McNally. The maps are more clearly set out, easier to read and flow from page to page. When you are crossing a state line, which I did many times, you do not have to jump to another part of the atlas to find maps of the new state. The atlas can also be used in conjunction with the Michelin Guides to the USA which again are unbeatable with perhaps the exception of those by Dorning Kingsley."
1,"Made in China, handle slips, silly packaging","I was willing to pay a more for this since it was advertised as made in USA (better for the environment and all of that). The packaging when the lopper arrived plainly stated that this item was mad in China. False advertising aside, the item arrived on time but the packaging was ridiculous. The box could have contained 20 loppers (this is Amazons bad). The lopper handles tend to slip a bit since the telescoping action lock allows for too much play. This is an annoyance. Overall this lopper is nothing special. I would have chosen the cheapest one if I knew I had no choice other than overseas manufacturing."
4,Good Tool,Good quality tool with good customer support from Gilmour. I have a bypass pair for cutting live/green branches and an anvil pair for cutting dead branches. When my original pair failed after many years of service I got good support from the manufacturer - a precious commodity these days.The 27 inch long handles and 'gear' drive provide good leverage without being so long as to get in the way when working in tight hedge areas..
4,Great Kids Set,"Plays great a home for the kids bedroom. I dont know how the other reviewer used this in his car, as It is not Ac/Dc operational. It has an auto play and shut off feature , that when the kids fall asleep,it will automatically rewind the tape and shut the power off!!"
1,Will definately NOT buy again!!!!,I had this TV in my daughter's room for less than 6 months when the VCR stopped working. Full warranty up after 90 days. Labor to fix is $80. There is NO way I would pay to have this fixed when the new ones cost around $100. The repair man who was referred by Sylvania told me this is not uncommon. He suggested I buy a new one and told me to stay away from Sylvania. His suggestion was Magnavox. So I'm off to buy one of those.
1,Somebody's been joking with the author,"As a former bookstore employee I sometimes took the time to check out the books we had. Reading travel books about my home country was fun because there will always be many incorrect facts and also stereotypes about the country. (You know, like ""all Norwegians are blonde"") This book somewhat captured the essence, the mentality of a Norwegian, but had, by far, the highest number of incorrect facts. Som much so, that I believe the author has been asking local Norwegians for facts and they've been trying to see how many strange things they could make her believe. And she did.Take it from me, I recommend Eyewitness Travel Guides instead."
2,Culture Snooze,"The book had alot to do with bringing kids to Norway, which is a book in itself. That being the case, it should have been another title and not so saturated a subject in this book.The text really did not have alot of meat to it.Pleasant, but not substantive."
5,Fabulous,"This is a super album. A little bit of polish compared to his earlier tracks, but still a raw and shaking sound. You won't be disappointed."
3,Good but needs more editing,It is amazing to see that so many sikhs take such pride about Duleep Singh where in reality what comes up from the book is that he was a fallen and a weak man consumed in alcohol and sex and who could not be trusted. If Ada was a spy who used her sexual power to reduce him to a fakir then what he deserves is nothing more than what he got at the end.
4,fast-food meditation and that's not bad.,"This a video for women who are extremely busy but know the value of a time-out. No matter how full your plate is, you need that quiet moment, not matter how short. This video presents mediation session in short sequences that you can feel free to lengthen on your own or enjoy in the short spurts, especially at lunch or between meetings. It proves that anyone can find the time to meditate. I am a devotee of the meditation videos of Rodney Yee and Maritza; they are the gold standard in meditation. But for those times when I have only a moment to quiet my mind, I reach for Meditation for Busy Women."
4,Black Crowes: Who Killed That Bird Out On Your Windowsill,"I knew about this video on VHS but was holding out. I had been waiting for this video to be released on DVD for some time. I was not disappointed. I have been a Black Crowes fan since their first album release and have loved everything they put out ever since. If you are a Black Crowes fan and heve not seen this video, buy it, you won't be disappointed.Freak and Roll into the fog is also an awsome but more current Black Crowes video."
2,poor clip art,"Very poor clip art. No way 250,00 clip art images: maybe 20,000? Who wants a zillion fonts instead of what was suppose to be clip art."
1,No se instala en Latinoamerica,"Este software, como otros de esta empresa, no se puede instalar en Win xp en español. Solo para EUA y Canada, increible!"
5,Rapid Run Multimedia Runner,I love these cables it makes for a quick install without the hassle of running multiple cords. I was able to connect my wall mount tv to my media center and it looks very professional. I have received many compliments while hosting my first superbowl party.
2,Be Careful,"These vitamin supplements are advertised as to be used for iguanas, too. I don't know about other pets listed, but these products often contain phosphorus. Too much phosphorus in the diet can be dangerous to iguanas, so please, if you're going to use these products, be absolutely certain you're maintaining a ration of 2:1 of Calcium:Phosphorus in your ig's diet. It's better to feed them foods high in calcium and low in phosphorus than to use these products, anyway. Collard greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, orange squashes, snow or snap peas, etc..."
2,Don't be suprised.,When it comes to the Apex AD-1225 DVD Player don't be surprised if it fails on you within a year upon buying it. Mine lasted approximately 7 months before destroying a DVD and failing to work again. I must say I did enjoy the DVD player due to its small size and it's low weight. I also enjoyed the buttons and the usability of the machine. It was not difficult to use and the remote was also simple in design. Nevertheless I cannot discount that 7 months of use was not worth the loss of a DVD and the cost of the product and a replacement. Please be forewarned and take this into consideration.
1,Apex Digital is a horrible company,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
1,Returned after a week,"The positive: Cheap, pretty good picture & sound quality.The Negative: Poorly made. Sometimes had to push eject button 3-4 times before a disk would eject. AFF function (which modifies widescreen to fill more of a standard TV) totally distorts the picture, & is unwatchable (the already thin actors look ridiculously tall & thin). After a few days the video began freezing in mid play, at first approx 1 second glitches, but soon it would just totally freeze and require a restart.Conclusion: Returned unit, & swithced brands."
1,Highly recommend you look elsewhere.,"I received this as a gift. It didn't work properly from the start, often refusing to open the DVD tray. Because I had another DVD player, I lent it to a friend. It worked when I demonstrated it, plugged it in, etc. She tried to watch a DVD last night, it wouldn't work. I thought perhaps I was just unlucky, but based on the other reviews, I suggest you don't waste your money on this product. It is a very poor value at any price."
4,PAL/NTSC,"For under $50 you cant get a better DVD player.It's not top of the line, but it workes fine.Mostly though it can play PAL and NTSC format DVD's.Which is why I bought it."
2,cheap but terrible,"I bought this one at walmart for <$35. I should have known better. It's worse than even its very low price would suggest. I could settle for bad image quality, lack of features, etc IF this thing would actually consistently play DVDs but all I get is skipping, freezing, refusing to play anything passed the FBI warning, refusing to eject, opening the tray but immediately closing it again trapping your fingers and the DVD (serious!), taking ages to ""boot"". This player has been giving me problems from the moment I first started using it. I now know it's the player because I've started to test problematic DVDs (all) on my powerbook and they do perfectly fine.Not worth even $30. I gave it 2 stars because it was so cheap it's really my fault for thinking I could get a half-decent player for that price."
2,DVD Player plays most DVDs,"We got the APEX AD-1225 for Christmas and haven't had that many problems with it. However I discovered that it is selective in the DVD's it chooses to play. We borrowed The Incredibles from a neighbor and it it wouldn't play past the FBI Warning. Thinking it was something wrong with their DVD, we went to the Rental Store and rented The Incredibles. It did the same exact thing. After much research on the computer, I found out that it turns out that some specific kinds of DVD's do not play on the APEX AD-1225. How very disappointing... When you rent or buy a DVD, you assume that it will work in every DVD player but it appears that the creators of DVD players don't always design their players to read all DVD's. My advice is this: If you're in the market for a DVD player, do your research before buying. Don't waste you're money or gift money in this case on a DVD Player that is selective in what it plays."
1,very disappointed,"I just purchased this product at Sears at a very, very low price for my daughter. It never did recognize the disc. It just kept saying ""loading"" after we put the disc in. We tried it several times. We will exchange it for another one. Hopefully it will work."
1,Apex customer service is nonexistent,"I bought one of these ""value"" Apex DVD players from Amazon about six months ago. The thing had an annoying hum at times, but worked... at first. After two months it wouldn't play DVDs longer than maybe 90 minutes. I tried calling their service line - no one answered the phone. I went to their Website and wrote to their service e-mail address - I received no response, ever.My guess is they figure (rightly) that no one is going to go to a lot of legal trouble over a device that costs less than $100. There are other companies that make low-end DVD players and other equipment - patronize one of them instead of Apex."
1,Horrible,"Cheap and ludicrously worse than even that price suggests. 30 minutes after I inserted ANY DVD, the picture would skip, freeze, sporadically display subtitles, and would even mess up the synchronization between the sound and the picture. You can only blame the performance on an uneven surface for so long before you get fed up. Save your money."
2,disappointed,I've enjoyed the fun funky books by this author. This book is part of a series of home idea books that lean towards the eclectic hippy tastes. But this book falls short.
1,Unacceptable Motor Vibration,"This would be a good product design-wise, but the motor is not well balanced and you can hear the vibration throughout the house."
2,Noisy and ....,"I installed this fan in the attic according to the instructions. I can hear in the room below and feel the spinning resonate in the adjacent rooms. It is well stabilized with 2x4's. I can't speak to it's effectiveness because after a few hours of the humming, I had to shut it off."
1,Fan is noisy and vibrates,Installed fan with vibration isolation washers.Very noisy and causes vibration which you can hear through the house.About to remove it and scrap it.Extremely disappointed in this product.
4,Social Commentary,"I really enjoyed this film, although it didn't really stick with me like I thought it would.I enjoyed Ryan Gosling's performance, which was about as far from the blond-haired toolbox in ""Murder by Numbers"" as it could be.*SPOILER ALERT*Gosling's character is weird, and the film draws a parallel between him killing his girlfriend's retarded brother and his girlfriend's sister's boyfriend killing him. I suppose the intention is for the viewer to almost perceive the two crimes as the same event.US of L has some really good dialog, dialog that I thought mirrors real life quite well. It would be easy to think that Lelend [the character] is a work of pure fiction, but I've met kids like him... kinda sad, sort of a melancholy brilliance.Good film."
4,RARE TALENT,"What a talent. These offbeat roles that Ryan picks really suit him. I think with every role he plays be it of this character or in The Notebook and Murder By Numbers to name a few, a little bit of him comes out in each role and definitely this character something of his real self seems to shine through. Not many actors have that. This film was a little confusing but I was glued from start to finish."
3,Interesting,"This film is perfectly acted, especially by Don Cheadle who reminded me of the reasons I first had for loving him. The dialogue is almost always outstanding, and the characters are true. I was pleased to see the teenage brain portrayed as something to marvel and wonder about. It was interesting to see the way actions produce reactions which lead to more actions over and over again but in an up-close and more clarified form than one usually sees in everyday life. The film provides a lot of internal conflict for any viewer. Example: Should we hate Leland for what he did? Are we comfortable with calling him a murderer? Do we sympathize with him?In all, this is a film worth watching even if for nothing else than the chance to witness some amazing performances and perhaps even ask yourself a question or two."
1,Terrible experiences with Samsung DVD players,"Although their TVs and monitors are fine, I've had nothing but bad experiences with Samsung DVD players, and now would not buy one on a bet.Over the past 3 years, I've bought 5 of them (slow learner) for myself or as gifts (and this includes more expensive - like $180 - models). ALL have been defective (skip, spontaneously go to pause, won't read some DVDs, etc.). I had one replaced under warranty, and it did the same thing.Whatever their problem is, I would recommend avoiding Samsung. Panasonic, Toshiba, Magnavox, even a Cyberhome work fine for me."
3,Loud whirring noise,"I just recently purchased the v3500 and was impressed with all the features it has to offer. However, this unit made a LOUD whirring noise while playing VHS tapes and an even LOUDER whirring noise while tracking. I tried it with both the standard connection as well as the line connection. I even tried it w/ the upgraded wires I bought. The noise is definitely in the mechanics of the unit. Before returning it, I purchased a second unit from Best Buy and it had the same problem. I am returning both. The DVD portion did not have that problem."
1,No zero star rating??,"Don't waste your money on this thing. I got it as a gift and wish I could get rid of it and get something that works. It has never actually played an entire DVD without us having to get up and smack the thing - the DVD's keep getting stuck. I don't watch VCR tapes much but my sister got one as a gift and uses the VCR all the time - or tries to. She's taken it apart 3 times in 6 months to get the tape out of the VCR. While it's playing, the tape sqeaks so loudly sometimes you can't hear the TV. The only good thing I have to say is that the DVD does eject when you tell it to. In short: this thing isn't worthy of taking up space in my trash can. I'm only keeping it until Dad comes to visit and see that we're using it. After that, it's a gonner."
1,Configured to code region 1,"There isn't a single note at the technical desciption that the player is blocked to region code 1. So, you can only play DVDs from USA."
2,Problems with remote and reading DVDs,"Like several of the other reviews, I have a remote that no longer functions. I am pretty sure the problem is actually on the unit, not the remote which is even more disconcerning. DVD play is frustrating at best without the remote and at worst you can not view discs at all that force you through an opening menu. In addition, I have had problems reading some DVDs at all and had problems with the picture breaking up on others. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because it was cheap and the VCR still works with a universal remote."
2,Compatability problem....,"Seems like an OK unit, but did not work with our Sanyo TV (wouldn't record) Samsung was very good about it tho."
4,Very good performance for this price point !,"I just replaced an ageing VCR with this unit, very happy with the DVD features (ie. Ezview zoom) and the VCR performance is quite good. If you want one unit that has the flexibility of DVD, VCR, MP3, etc., you can't go to wrong for the price. Features like being able to use the VCR to record TV or Line input while watching a DVD is very handy.In response to some of the negative reviews:""Beware the Red Screen""I also experience the red tint when using the component connection to my Toshiba TV. This was corrected by going in to the DVD menu and changing the alternate connection to ""Component, Interlaced"". As soon as the menu option was change the red tint went away.""VHS not working from S-video connection""It's not made to, the unit only has quasi-SVHS play back not full SVHS playback. VHS output is only available on the RF and the composite video connections."
1,Stay Away!,"Terrible. This unit has been trouble since it came out of the box...ten months after we purchased it, it stopped working altogether."
3,Not so great,"Not what I expected. The back panel is divided into two parts: one part says DVD, the other part says DVD and VCR. There is only one S-video cable, it is on the DVD side. If you choose to use the S cable (to get better picture quality from your DVDs) then you turn off the video output from the VCR. You can only get video out from the DVD and VCR if you use regular yellow/red/white cables. I called customer service, they were no help. I was disappointed, so I gave it to my kids for the rec room."
1,PLEASE Listen to the negative reviews!,"As more than 10 of the 20 or so reviews I read about this unit say, it DOES lock up on almost every DVD we try to watch, the remote IS horrible and it IS very hard to get the recorder to function properly. I definitely should have come here to check opinions out, EVERY single DVD we have tried to watch locks up about an hour into it for no apparent reason, the $30 APEX dvd player we bought a year ago is leaps and bounds better than this unit. Sometimes after the lock up problem it won't even continue playing after removing the disc and putting it back in! Horrible unit, I strongly suggest avoidance. Samsung, you have no excuse."
2,Pathetic,"I expected more from Samsung. I bought this player with good hope from a brand I though I trusted. Now two months into having it, the DVD drive is broken. It will not let me bring up the menu screen to program the VCR to record a show or anything, and now I put in a DVD and it wont even play that. All I get now is a shakey blue screen of death. Ill be getting this back to the store I bought from very quickly and purchasing a different brand completely. Stay Away from Samsung!!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This Samsung combo is one of the cheaper ones out there. I felt like I was getting a steal. However, first the remote was inoperative for about a month and the DVD function of the unit is nonfunctional without the remote. Now, it will not read any DVD. The unit has hardly been used, is kept in a clean area, etc. I am not going to send the whole unit in like I did with the remote control. Customer Service made me jump through hoops on that. I just plan on replacing it with something better."
1,Not Good For DVDs,"I do not recommend this product. It scratched my Lord of the Rings DVDs and then I bought new DVDs and it played them like they were scratched but, they worked fine on other players."
1,Lemon,I bought this unit and within 2 months and little use.........it consistently said &quot;no disk&quot; was in the unit when clearly there was. The repairman at the local video shop told us the laser wasn't working properly and that it was pretty much JUNK and that is what we did with it. I wouldn't recommend a Samsung product to anyone without the purchase of a warranty of some type.
3,Mediocre at best,The picture quality is good but the unit I bought suffers from noisy playback. I took it to a service center and they couldn't find anything wrong with it. The noise can be very annoying at times. The remote control is terrible. I am at this moment trying to get my other remotes to work this unit.
4,Great unit !,"I just replaced an ageing VCR with this unit, very happy with the DVD features (ie. EZview) and the VCR performance is quite good. I if you want one unit that has the flexibility of DVD, VCR, MP3, etc., you can't go to wrong for the price. Features like being able to use the VCR to record TV or Line input while watching a DVD is very handy.In response to some of the negative reviews:""Beware the Red Screen""I also experience the red tint when using the component connection to my Toshiba TV. This was corrected by going in to the DVD menu and changing the alternate connection to ""Component, Interlaced"". As soon as the menu option was change the red tint went away.""VHS not working from S-video connection""It's not made to, the unit only has quasi-SVHS play back not full SVHS playback. VHS output is only available on the RF and the composite video connections."
2,Beware! Check all functions to make sure they work!,"I have recently purchased this Samsung DVD-V3500 and i got to tell you the dvd was great! It had lots of features that i liked and i the remote was really easy to use. It was very easy to setup the dvd/vcr player i had no trouble at all. But before you decide on keeping this device check all the functions. I had checked all the functions to make sure they worked and the dvd functions worked great but the vcr did not! The play, stop, rewind, etc. all worked EXCEPT for the STILL function. It came up very blurry and was not a clear image u can barely see anything and i checked to see if it was the tape and was not because it worked excellent on my other vcr player. So the SLOW, and STILL function did NOT WORK. So please check and make sure that all your functions work correctly."
1,Beware purchasing this unit.,"I bought this unit about 2 months ago from Ultimate Electronics in Layton Utah. It was on sale and now I know why. As everybody has mentioned the remote sucks eggs big time!! One of the most frustrating remotes I have ever used. It works when it wants to. Another big problem is you'll be watching the DVD movie and it will decided to lock up. It happens to me on every movie we watch. I have to unload the disc and reload to finish the movie. I thought I just had a defective unit but based on all the comments on this site, it seems Samsung built these flaws in by design. Shame on you Samsung. I will never by another Samsung product again. Since it can't be fixed I'm giving it away to my local church. Its better than tossing it."
1,DVD player stops working after 10 months,"I bought this DVD-VCR combo in December 2003. In August of 2004, the DVD player started giving a ""Disc cannot be played, please check the disc"" message, intermittently. By the end of September, it stopped loading and playing DVDs completely. I called Samsung, and after a week or two of calling back and forth, they agreed to send me a prepaid mailing label so I could ship my player back to them. Within two weeks of returning it, they sent me a refurbished player. Now, 10 months later, it has the exact same problem as my orginial player. DVDs will no longer play. I have been in contact again with Samsung, and have been waiting for a call back from them for a week now, to see if they will again send me a replacement. Judging from other reviews, this is a common problem with this player. Don't waste your money on it. Personally, I would not trust any Samsung product based on my experience with this DVD-VCR combo player."
1,I agree--don't buy it.,"My husband and I have an older version of this combo, and the DVD problems have been getting progressively worse until now it hardly will play DVDs at all. My husband is ready to run over it in the driveway. I have to bounce the remote signal off the wall to get it to work. We started having problems about 6 months after we bought it, but thought it was because of scratched rental movies. We will be replacing very soon!"
1,2 for 2,"A few years ago I purchased an earlier model Samsung DVD/VCR combo unit. I had no problems whatsoever. So, when I contemplated purchasing another unit for my bedroom, I decided to go with Samsung again because I figured that I wouldn't have a learning curve. And that was absolutely true. However, all of a sudden, the older unit started acting up, with the skipping, loading, stalling problems. And the amazing thing was that the unit continued to play CDs. Ah well, I thought, I got at least two years out of it. Shortly thereafter however, the combo unit in my bedroom began encountering the same issues. Annoyance isn't the word. Suffice to say that I will NEVER purchase another Samsung DVD product and I too am sorry that I didn't read reviews before I made the second purchase. It won't happen again."
1,Samsung DVD-V3500,"I have had the DVD/VCR combo for 4 months. Now it locks up with every DVD I try to play. If it does start playing a DVD it will lock up in the first 15 mins. User manuel is useless, Samsungs web site is not much better. Buyer Beware!"
1,Save your money and get something else,"We recieved this as a gift and it would not play tapes properly. Every one we tried looked like heck, no amount of tracking helped. We had to send the unit in to the fixed,okay, we think all is well now. We were wrong, now the DVD side has stopped working, in the middle of a movie. It now says it can't read the disc or any other one we try in it. Do not bother with this item, and I agree with the other person who said the remote isn't very good, it isn't. You must have it aimed in the exact spot or it won't work."
1,"bad, bad, bad","Do not buy it, it died soon after I bought it, gets stuck in loading, not worth at all"
1,Another one bites the dust,"I have the same story that I see here many times. It was great, then the DVD player started freezing up, then it was iffy on whether or not it would load a DVD, and now it doesn't load any DVD. The DVD side is now useless. POS."
2,What Happened?,"About a year ago I was about to write a review on this product praising it because I was really impressed with mine. Before I did so I read other reviews that claim the dvd drive goes out. Becuase there were several of them I decided to wait on my review and see what happens to mine. Well what do you know? A year later, the day that Kill Bill Vol. 2 comes out, I get so excited and rush home to watch it; and the stupid dvd drive freezes up in the middle of the movie. I checked it with other dvds and so on ans so on. It is aparent that the drive is completely junked out. I can not praise a product that only lasts one year! Of course waranty is now long gone and I have to put more money down on a new unit. It will definatley not be this one! The remote is also a god awful piece of equipment. Yuck!"
3,This player isn't that bad,"This is a good DVD/VCR combo player. It plays almost all kinds of discs except asian standard VCD/SVCD. I bought it to play my MP3s since I have a more decent Pioneer DVD player to play my DVDs/CDs.Sometimes, it pays to read the manual and use common sense when evaluating DVD players. Though it is a lot easier to blame it on the manufacturer when people can get their stuffs to work :D but most of the reviews I read involved user errors"
3,Okay but remote is horrible,"No I really mean it, the remote is the worst I've ever used. You have to aim it just right and really slam the buttons, plus the fast-forward and rewind scan is super-jerky and it takes a bit to respond to the remote."
5,Useful and Funny,"I was given this book right before I went to Italy for vacation. I am not the biggest Ice cream fan but I have been told that Gelato is an experience of its own, which I found to be very true. This book is very funny, it had me laughing out loud at certain parts. Not only does the author take you visually through the gelataria, he lets you know what to expect and gets you prepared to face the ""gelato man"". He even gives you tips for when you get jammed up, with what is call his ""go to cones"".Great book!"
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"What a depressing movie!? That poor kid! It really makes you wonder just how many kids are suffering the same way on a daily basis right under our noses. I'll tell ya one thing, this movie sure makes you appreciate what you've got."
1,on our 4th bulb in less than a year,"We purchased our 65"" in June of 2007. Within 4 months the bulb blew. Replacement sent no problem until it went out again in a month and a half and again in another month. We are now on our 4th bulb for a TV that is less than a year old. It is our third Mitsubushi and was purchased because of our history with this brand, but now we are having second thoughts. It is an expensive paper weight!!! We asked to have a repair technician after the second bulb and was told to try one more before a repair order would be issued, now here we are and now we are told no one will service our area. We are not in the country. We are 60 miles from a major city. Mitsubishi needs to make this right. We have read similiar experience on this site and think the company needs to be responsible."
1,Broke down - no parts,"Although Mitsubish may be ranked highly, they fail miserably in the customer service dept. Light engine went out on TV. It has been four months and still not repaired yet. Over the last three weeks I have called Mitsubishi Consumer Relations 3-4 times a day to try to get an answer. Sometimes they will transfer your call to 'Level 2' Consumer Relations, at times they refuse. Their response is always 'part will be shipped in 7-10 business days'. Four months later it is still the same excuse.Highly disappointed in Mitsubishi. What really upsets me is that the TV is for my elderly mother who is confined to the house and this wonderful product of theirs has been sitting in the living room inoperable for four months. There was no offer to replace the TV. This is how they treat their customers and the elderly. Will never buy Mitsubishi product again.Also, the menu is not user friendly. Sony is much better."
1,"Buy a Pioneer, Sony or Samsung instead !","We bought the ""Diamond"" model of this TV last February. It first died this summer due to an overheating problem. The repair man knew about the problem when he arrived and had the part with him, it wasn't the first time he had fixed the problem. He mentioned that he hoped we had purchased the extended warranty (we didn't.)It died again on Super Bowl Sunday before the game started. This time it appears the ""Optical Engine"" and lamp have failed, though I am not sure because the repair man can't come out until next week. That was his guess over the phone after having me run some basic diagnostics.The bottom line is we paid lots of money for a TV that has now failed twice in the first year we've had it. That is NOT good, I would never recommend this TV. My repair person told me that he rarely gets called for Pioneer, Sony or Samsung models, but that he gets lots of calls for Mitsubishi."
2,Three great years then it died,"I've had my WD-65734 for three years and it was great. I did everything by the book (using surge protectors, battery backup, and lamp preservation techniques) but apparently the capacitors that mitsubishi uses are junk and they have failed. Now I have a 65"" black screen that won't turn on and just blinks the initialization light at me."
4,BIG screen TV that's affordable,We have had this television for a couple of years now and can only complain about the light that has been replaced twice so far. This $100 plus part is easy to replace but why do they seem to be such a weak link in this otherwise high quality TV? Picture quality is excellent and colors are bright and brilliant. Just hope the bulb will last longer this time. At least there is only one to worry about replacing.
1,Mitsubishi 73733,"I love the picture on this set (WD-73733) but after a while the hum is unbearable to me, so much so, that I just called and told them to take it back."
3,Truly not his best effort,"I am a huge fan of buckethead, I love everything the guy does regardless of how farfetch'd it is.But this cd was a real dissappointment. His guitar skills are hardly showcased on this release which is bad enough, but many tracks on this thing are just a bunch of dj noise. Even all the drum beats were sampled so Brain had little involvement with this album. This pretty much sounds like something he just threw together just for the hell of throwing something together, which is a shame because anyone who has heard buck play knows that he's capable of so much more.Only pick this up if you are a serious collector. I believe it is already out of print, but it is available on Buck's site."
4,Great and meaningful music!,"I first was introduced to Karen and her music at a ""Radical Forgiveness"" workshop. This was held in Cincinnati, Ohio and was based on the book ""Radical Forgiveness"" by Colin C. Tipping. Colin facilitated the workshop and Karen provided the music. This was a great experience! If you like music that has a great message this may be the CD for you. Her other collections are excellent as well. Her message is especially good for many of the changes women experience. Highly recommended. (D. Steven Ledingham)"
4,Timeless insights with eloquence,"Handley Carr Glyn Moule (1841-1920) was an Anglican bishop and prolific writer. Two of his brothers were missionaries. This is a compilation of 156 devotionals from three of his writings, ""Thoughts for the Sundays of the Year"" (1907), ""From Sunday to Sunday"" (1903), and ""The Sacred Seasons"" (1907). Moule originally intended for these meditations to be read on Sundays, as a preparation for the reader. The editors of AMG have updated the text in a few places, and added scripture references. Yet this work has timeless insights. Moule writes with a late nineteenth century eloquence on various topics, with several devotions on the resurrection, the trinity, and holidays such as Christmas and Easter. It makes this a fine devotional or sermon aid."
4,I've been looking for this for years!,"If you were a hippie Christian in the early 1970's you may have read this version of the New Testament. If so, then you will ""get it"". It is written in the street language of the time. I had forgotten some of the language used until I read it again. So I consider this almost an historical document.For those of you who were not a teenager in the late sixties and seventies it may all just sound weird to you. You would probably enjoy a version written in your slang. Or you might like to find out how teenagers talked back in the 1960's and 1970's.I loved it."
4,Kept me wanting more,"Enjoyed the second in this series, prompted me to buy the remaining books in the series. Hoping for more to come"
5,Tris's Book,"I always enjoy Tamora's books and that goes for the circle of magic, it's funny and adventurous while also being an addicting read."
4,MAGIC TRAINING,"literally. This continues on from Sandry's book, and it is excellent. Four young beginners in magic and coming from a time of depression, Niko finds them, and when realising their magic abilities, brings them to Winding Circle.Love, Care, Compassion, Magic, Adventure, and thrills are all in this book. check out the others too. SANDRY'S BOOK, TRIS'S BOOK, DAJA'S BOOK, AND BRIAR'S BOOK. they're all excellent, as are all of Ms Pierce's books. check them all out."
3,Good book,"I think that this book was alright, but not what I expected. It was good, seeing how Tris's powers were, and kind of getting to know her better, it still wasn't all that I wanted and expected. I probably would have rated it higher if I liked Tris more, but it wasn't just her that made me not give it 5 stars. It was a good book in the Circle of Magic Quartet, which is one of Tamora's best quartet so far, but I could have had more. I think that the other two (Sandry's and Daja's) were more interesting and entertaining."
5,I just LOVE this series :^),"Tamora Pierce must have been blessed with the idea of this series. It is great even without romance, that's the beauty of it. I am sick of all these series that have romance in them because they are all gushy and lovey-dovey. Exactly the kinds of books that do not appeal to me. Thank goodness for the change."
4,A summary,"In this book, Tris and her friends Daja, Sandry, and Briar are involved in the defense of a pirate attack. The real trouble starts when Daja goes out to help strengthen the chains that block the harbor with her smith magic. The others are woken by a vision of Daja in the harbr and exploding balls all around. In the end, Tris's friends are held captive by the evil mage Emelan who is the pirates' head mage. Tris has to save them. Even better than the first book in the series."
3,Stale Tale,"I do wish there was more romance, don't we all? Trish has never been an appealing character, but oh well, it was a ho hum book that passed some time for me."
2,What a BUMMER,"I was a huge, and I mean huge fan of Tamora Pierce. I was gushing praize and then I read this book. It is basically a desparite attempt to start a new series on the same topic she always does: strong female gets training in fighting and magic and becomes a wonderfull leader, now don't get me wrong, i live for that type of book, but you see, after the Lioness Quartet, and the Wild Magic series, she sort of exausted the topic, so It was like reading the same things with different names, and sloppily done too. I did not give it one star because I think it would be a bit to harsh, because it did have a few good spots, and i can see how some people would like it. But if you have read a lot of Tamora Pierce's writings, warning: do not buy this book. But if you haven't go ahead, it might even be the type for you."
1,They DON'T get better,"Okay, I think Sandry's book wasn't good, but I kept reading the series, hoping the next was better. Tris's book might have been actually WORSE!!! I am SO dissappointed in Tamora Pierce. She could do a MUCH better job (example: Alanna, Daine, etc, etc). The characters were lacking and the plot was....I'm saying this in the nicest way possible for me....DROP DEAD BORING!!!!!!!! I'm not going to waste anymore time on this series. Goodbye!"
3,Same Old Same Old,I really do LOVE Tamora Pierce books but lately I'm getting bored. Most of the books that I have read have the same kind of texture maybe that's normal I guess I wouldn't really know. Well for one thing I liked Tris. She is a stuborn girl but with a strong will and a good heart. I thought the book could have used more excitment/adventure. Sometimes I got a bit bored because it was laging in suspense. Although overall it was an okay book.
5,fantastic saga of life in the thrall of a oriental god/dess.,"Ffor those who love erotic comix this is the one for you. Tthe drawings are superb, the story is complex and exciting, and the sex is the hottest. Heavy sub/dom(mme) content, bizzarre characters, dreamy sceens. Well worth the price and Manning has many other books as well, each one a delight."
5,Tastefully good,"It's great. But it's not for the sexually weak hearts. This book is best viewed with an open-mind and a love for erotic art. At first, I thought it wasn't going to argee with me but it did. It's very good and the stories will pull you in. The art is fanstastic and beautifully detailed. This is just my opinion on the book. If you do buy it, I hope that you will enjoy it."
4,Sublime and Masterfull,"Not as strong as his later book Transeptor, but Spider Garden is a cool dream world of bondage and domination. Buy it for the art...and you'll be taken to places that will fill your dreams for years to come."
4,It's nice...,"I expected the songs of the musical; and I got them, however what I expected were the voices of Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler, and this ain't it. I wish. Anyhow, this will require learning the songs a little differently; the timing is different, and the lyrics are indeed slightly altered from how I remember; I'm miffed that there's no lyrics sheet or anything. I'm going to have to listen to one CD first to learn the timing and all the lyrics, and then switch CDs to sing them on my own.But all in all I like it, and it's also very nice to listen to at night, even if I'm not trying to sing it, and the woman who does sing it (whoever she is) isn't bad to listen to, though the man who sings the Phantom's part... should be GB. Sob."
3,Hope Springs Eternal,"Since this CD was released in 2006, I was hoping against hope that the music,lyrics and arrangements would be identical to the movie. But, alas, they are not. They are examples of various versions from Webber's play.As a karaoke, this CD is average, at best."
4,Of course it's weird!,"Many reviews here focus on the fact that the boys are barely in this video (not true) HOWEVER it is a variety show so yes there are many other musicians who receive and deserve airtime (Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll and the Trinity are amazing) This is probably the wildest thing I've ever seen on network tv, even 30 years later. The rave up ending of ""Listen to the Band"" is not to be believed. If you are ONLY interested in seeing the boys and not getting a feel for the music THEY liked (they picked the guest stars)and the strange, trippy times in which this was produced, then stay away."
3,Not a Good Way to end the Monkees Phenomon,"This was kind of dissappointing to me. I can watch it, but I don't know. I mean basically it just starred this weird guy and lady and the Monkees hardly had speaking roles. They just sang and said a few one liners. Plus they weren't in it that much. I think it could have been a little bit better. I did like Naked Persimmon though. Two Mikes were hilairous."
2,Critically speaking---for collector's only.,"Unique--not nearly as unique as ""Head""-- interesting and amusing look at how The Monkees may have evolved (no pun intended). Very psychedelic--will have to fast forward quite a bit to catch the group in this one--entertaining spots from the icons of rock-Fats Domino, Little Richard, etc."
1,NOT for Monkees fans!,"I only gave this movie one star because you have to in order to post. If you're looking for something comparable to ""Head"", THIS IS NOT IT! The Monkees appear in this movie for a total of about ten minutes. Most of those I spent cringing with embarassment for the poor guys! The only redeeming moments were Peter singing ""Prithee"" and Mike's ""Naked Perssimon,"" but I don't think they're worth spending money to see. In fact, if it were up to me, it would be a capital crime to sell this movie at all."
2,I Love the Monkees......BUT,"I am a HUGE Monkees fan, BUT--This is one of the Monkees worst offerings. No wonder this was the beginning of the end for them! I spent most of my viewing time fast forwarding through this video--even the music was lousy. I'm glad that I only need this particular video to help round out my Monkees video collection because it will probably never get played again--and that's MY two cents worth!"
1,Embarrasing,"I'm a fan of their music (well, apart from most of the Jones-sung stuff), and I love ""HEAD"", so I had high hopes of this. But it's really cringe-makingly emabarrasingly awful. It looks cheap and sounds cheap, none of the magic of ""HEAD"" here at all! There are 2 saving graces: Nesmith's solo song (""Naked Persimmon"" - always a man for a weird title is Nez) and the first couple of minutes of the Monkees' version of ""Listen to the Band"", then that too soon becomes unwatchable and unlistenable. I took my copy back to the store for a refund - it really is very grim indeed."
2,The Monkees production that only die-hard fans could stand,"Julie Driscol and a backup band...guest starring..The Monkees! Really not a good way to start your Monkees collection, but if you're looking to finish it off, grab this up. A lot of non-Monkee appearences; Little Richard, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis and various others. The evolution and obvious destruction of the Monkees as seen through the eyes of Darwin. A very odd little number, a 50's medly, and Peter playing Bach. The Listen To The Band close is what makes the entire video, a beautiful swan song. Something for the die hard fan. END"
1,Awful quality,"Horrible quality, many repeats, many sounds mislabeled.Interesting idea, as far as the software goes, but not useful for anything, even a simple amateur home/family video project.Not worth even half the money."
1,Does not work on Win XP,The description says that it will work on Windows 95 or later. Unfortunately it does not work with Windows XP or Vista.
5,Beautiful and handy,These colored pencils are beautiful and durable. They come in a handy metal case where they can be stored to use again and again. A first-rate product.
1,Woodland Camouflage Shopping Bag,"Do not waste your money. The bags are simply cheap plastic, no better then what you get from the grocery store. I thought they would be strong enough to be used over and over...."
2,not what I expected,"This is more of a history of water and wind power. It does not give information on how to set it up yourself, which is what I was looking for."
1,nearly useless,"Even though I was careful about capping the pen right after each use, the pens quickly dried up and became useless."
4,"Adequate Treatment, Not Great","Grodecki's ""Not Angels But Angels"" is fair treatment of the overwhelming issue adolescent male prostitution in Prague. Although I think his fictionalized treatment in ""Mandragora"" is better, this is a good first look into these young boys world."
4,5 stars minus one for the stupid skits before the surf,"Great movie. Moves well. Good extras. Wipeouts were action packed for once. Slater and Machado were at their best in some interesting places. Music was awesome. Your usual Blink and Jack Johnson beats, but well placed with the surfers. Oh yeah, just watch it for the music and sites, the skits were pretty bad."
3,IT'S NOT PERSONAL,"This is the same film as the 2010 movie ""This is Who I Am."" The packaging has more color and they have a title with more appeal. The film is cliche filled with phrases like ""territory,"" ""respect,"" and ""stick ball."" Carlo (Marco Arras) and Nick (Nino Cimino) are partners and bookies in Miami. Carlo wants to expand the business and starts a war with another group of mobsters, the Leone family, over 23rd street. Elizabeth Mae is Nick's girlfriend who gets trapped in the middle. She played her role very well. I am surprised she is not in more films.The Italian mobster acting was overdone. The fighting was ""soft"" as men get continually punched and don't appear to be in too much pain. The writing was...well let's say Nimo Cimino is to mobster films as what Steven Seagall is to action films. This is a simple forward low budget mobster film.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Elizabeth Mae, Brittani Noel, Carmelita Hughes)"
5,Great book on Old Hollywood,"I loved this book...entertaining true stories on many of my favorite stars of the golden Age of Hollywood. A true ""insider's"" point of view."
3,Fun little book,"I enjoyed the majority of this book, and Marcella certainly has some personal recollections to relate. It is easy reading and enjoyable."
2,Blade chipped in two places,"I bought the 3-piece set for my son for Christmas 2011. Tonight I was cutting up a spaghetti squash using the chef's knife and it chipped in two places and dented in another. Due to Amazon's policy of 30 days for returns, we are stuck with a totally useless, but expensive knife."
1,Chipped,"My Shun chef's knife is chipped. We have treated this knife with kid gloves, literally. We keep it in its own special drawer, it has not ever been in the dishwasher, we use it only on a wood cutting board, yet the knife edge has chipped. Their response? Too bad, it's been over 30 days. I got this knife set for my wife for Christmas, she was so excited. We noticed the chip within a couple weeks of use. It is not worth the money, the quality is just not there. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Small rust and pitting after one use,"I purchased these knives for my wife's Christmas present. She used them for the first time to cut fruit, rinsed them off and dried them with paper towels. A few days later there was pitting and very small spots of rust along a seam that runs very close to the sharp edge of the knife. I immediately returned them to Amazon who accepted the return and refunded us. It was a disapointment for us and I do NOT recommend these knives."
1,First day,I bought this set for my wife. First day she tried cut frozen meat and big one splintered after 20 sec. I saw such trick first time and I hope last time.
1,What's the point??,"Ok, you buy a 5-disc changer because you want to load it up with 5 music CDs, hit play, and sit back and enjoy one disc after the other. Wrong. It doesn't do this. You have to manually push ""next disc"" and ""play"" after each CD is done playing. So what's the point of having a changer at all??"
1,Won't Play CDs,"I agree with the other reviewers that it won't shuffle audio CDs, but I'll take it one step further and say that mine won't even play any music CD at all in any format! Not what I had in mind. It goes back today."
3,Player,I was very unhappy with the service of this company. This sented me and e-mail and said the player was sent in Dec. and I was suppose to get it by Feb. 2. On the 11th of Feb I contacted them and they said that it hadn't even been shipped out. They finally got it sented.
2,Seriously...what's the deal?,"The picture quality this player produces is quite up to par. The sound quality is also good. I have but one qualm with this product...a major qualm, actually:It is not good at actually playing DVDs. The tiniest scuff or scratch results in audio/video skippage. I have attempted to clean the player numerous times, but to no avail. Perhaps my room is far too dusty? I don't know. I routinely find myself trying to use it, hoping it won't skip, but to no avail. I almost always end up having to watch the DVD on my computer.Again, perhaps the skippage is due to the environment that the player is in. In any case, I find it practically unusable."
3,Not too bad.. or good,"I bought this player a while back, and connected it to my hdtv with no problems, using component cables and progressive scan switch turned on. It plays every dvd I have tried, and every audio cd also. It does not play a standard vcd, instead, it plays SVCDs, which are better anyway, since you can vary the effective quality. I'm pretty sure it will play a DVD-R (Most any player should be able to read this format), but I am sure it won't play DVD+Rs (This is too advanced for most players to play without being designed for it specifically). It plays mp3 cds, but will not navigate through directories, so you'll have to unsort your music and put them all in the root directory of the cd, and it plays them alphabetically. This wouldn't have been my first choice if I was going for the best, but at its price, I don't think you can beat the features that it does have."
2,"it's OK, but some important features are missing","I got this DVD player yesterday, got it all hooked up to my reciever and TV, and I was pleased with it. Played movies beautifully (used digital coax for sound and s-video), but I also wanted it to be used as a CD changer for music. I tried putting 5 music cds in on random, and came to the conclusion that this player is incapable of playing more than 1 cd random. The manual says to ""choose one disc or all discs"", but this command is missing from the interface. You can choose random, but it doesn't give you a choice of 1 or all. So you're stuck with 1 disc at a time. Also, once it's done playing the one disc, it does not automatically go to the next. As far as I can tell, the only way to switch discs EVER is to manually hit the disc skip button. Sort of defeats the purpose of having a changer, doesn't it..."
5,Clapton Collector? Gotta have it!,"Amazon doesn't really provide much information on this Japanese cd, so I'll use this opportunity to provide that info for those of you wondering what this mysterious import is :) The cd was released by Reprise and Duck Records in 1995 with the catalog number WPCR-440. It contains five tracks and comes with a booklet that has complete lyrics in both English and Japanese. The tracks are: 1.It Hurts Me Too(Elmore James p.1994) 2.Crosscut Saw(R.G. Ford p.1983) 3.Everybody Oughta Make A Change(Sleepy John Estes p.1983) 4.Bad Influence(Clay-Vannice p.1986) 5.Before You Accuse Me(E. McDaniel p.1989) As usual with Japanese imports, the recording and packaging are excellent. Probably a little pricey for casual Clapton fans, but a wonderful gap filler for serious Claptonites."
3,Not for Widetrack Jeep Cherokees/Wagoneers,"I purchased this to replace my tie rod ends. All the websites I could find pointed to this item as the one I needed. Unfortunately, I didn't realize until I got it on that it was too short. I had to go and order a new, correct tie rod. The construction is great, the part is high quality, just the wrong one.If you have a Widetrack Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer, this is the part number you need: MOOG-DS896Moog DS896 Steering Center Link Tie Rod End"
1,This system is crap,"I got it as a gift a few months ago and, at first, everything was fine. Then it started freezing on one DVD after another. It began with LoTR, then the Princess Bride, then occasionally on LoTR:TT and now on HBO's Band of Brothers. The DVDs play without a problem on other DVD players.The system still has a few months of warranty left so I will try talking to Samsung. But given some of the online comments I've read, it appears to me they will want me to ship, at my expense, a 55lb DVD player."
3,Low power system,"It might work for your bedroom, but the system is not powerful enough for my small living room. The woofer is strong, but the rest of the speakers are very weak.Add to that a confusing remote and long pauses at start-up, advancing tracks, and changing disks, and I would rather have gone with a small Sony, Panasonic, or Jensen.On the positive side; it was inexpensive, plays lots of formats, it's very slim/stylish, it's easy to hook-up, perfect... if you're going to use it in your bedroom."
4,Good value system,This is a very good system for the price. The sound quality is pretty good and the dvd player is top notch. Hook up was very easy and and system comes with easy to install wiring.The manual is pretty weak so be prepared to learn the system on your own by trial and error.There are certainly better sounding systems out there but you won't find them in this price range. This is a very good value.
4,Excellent organization and presentation,"I found this book a very useful aid for learning Hebrew by myself. For one example: at last the construct form made sense! I wasn't an absolute beginner when I started, since I already had mastered the alphabet and begun to accumulate a small vocabulary, but I'd been frustrated by the other texts I'd tried in order to learn in a systematic way.I do wish there was an answer key available, so I could check my work on the exercises."
3,"Very technical, but not user friendly.","This book will certainly teach you Biblical Hebrew, but compared with other courses I've used, this book was the least helpful. It is not very exciting (doesn't hold interest as well as others), is large and bulky (can't take it with you everywhere you go so you can study all the time), and is sometimes a little confusing. It makes a good supplementary course to take while you are working through other Hebrew language courses if you want to spend that much money on another book."
1,no good!,"Badly organized and very frustrating to use. It was probably made for those who have a very poor background in (english) grammar. This point notwithstanding, it still fails its purpose!"
5,"Great book, easy to learn from","This book teaches the language in frequency order, teaching you the most common things first, which allows you to quickly begin reading authentic texts. This method is effective since this is also the way that children learn their first language, learning the most common words first. Learning in this way makes the language more natural and much easier to pick up quickly."
1,Not so much 1957 - Not so much San Francisco,"Super lame movie, bad acting, horrible script as expected. Most of the ""beautiful 1950's San Francisco"" shots are of the inside of a house. Scenery consists of a very short sequence in what appears to be a city park with some trees. The Sheriff's deputies pull up in a '65 Ford patrol car, kind of improbable if this film was made in 1957 as claimed. A true waste of money and time."
5,Love it,"I use 8 drops on oatmeal or plain yogurt. It's important to mix well cuz you wouldn't want to taste it straight. Mixed in, it gives a great flavor to fat free, flavor free yogurt or oatmeal. Not grainy like splenda or other sweeteners. Be sure to not microwave the oatmeal after putting it in. It doesn't heat well-gives an aftertaste that is unpleasant. But it's a great product to use as I mentioned-no calories."
4,More and Better,"This is a great album of sunny, sixties pop with the contemporary spin that only Honeyrider can achieve. Their love of the Beach Boys and Surf music spun into great power pop is unlike any other band. I actually like it better than All Systems Go! It reminds me of the JTG Implosion tune - Sunshine.""Get into the Sunshine"""
3,Interesting,Movie was good wonder where they are now? shows how gays have created there own world which they should not have to because we all was born into one world together just diffrent places.
2,rm,"With all the five stars having been given this movie, I expected much more. The packaging of the DVD gives a false impression (looks nice on the outside but inside mostly repackaged old stuff.) While the historical context of gay life is worthy of perhaps four stars, the feature itself rates less. It is short at seventy-six minutes. The picture quality for this overpriced DVD is poor. The outtakes are very poor. They appear to be copied from an old worn out VHS tape with no remastering. Don't expect much from this DVD."
4,Gal Pals?,"Just like in the fictional, big-screen stories, drag queens have it pretty rough in this fascinating documentary about guys who wanna look like gals in the Big Apple."
2,For sure 70's,"I found it entertaining and interesting from a historical prospective, with a few interviews that allowed a glimpse of the real person, otherwise not much substance. My feel was that the way they approached was from a voyeuristic angle rather than one looking to gain insight."
5,I want this movie on DVD right NOW!,"What's up with the entertainment industry? They shovel [bad stuff] down our throats like Spy Kids 2 and Gigli, but try to find brilliant, daring movies like Paris is Burning or Hoop Dreams on DVD - forget it. You might as well try to find Barbara Bush in a tube top on Bourbon Street. Which, now that I think about it, has an demonic sort of appeal all its own. And with that Wilma Flintstone pearl necklace of hers...what a sizzling hot look! I can hear Beelzebub cackling with delight right now.See you in New York this August, Barbara!"
1,Pretty useless,"I thought this book was actually a guide to how to get a hold of the contracts to Iraq. I was interested in starting a company to sell simple items to the average Iraqi, items they had been forced to live without but this book was no help. THis is NOT a business book but it is just a political narrative attacking corporations like Halliburton and Bechtel. A total sham of a read, nothing is reported here that cant be found in the latest issue of the Journal."
3,Beautiful but a little uneven.,"All the pictures are beautiful, the photography is excellent, but some of the images are a little weak and uninteresting. With a little more self-criticism and a little more work the book could have been really good."
3,PalmOne Treo 650 rubber case,Saved my phone several times when I dropped it. The only thing I didn't like is it gets loose after a few months.
2,Does not wear well for extended use,This condom cover is OK if you just need something to protect the phone. If you wear it on your belt you should look some where else. The clip has come out 3 times on me already almost damaging the phone. I am surching for a replacement as I type this.
2,Breaks easily - poor material for high use/Belt Clip use,"My husband purchased this and although it looks cool, it has broken after only 6 months of use. The notch that hooks the case to the belt clip broke off as well as the banding holding the top of the case. My husband had to resort to using a rubberband to hold it together!One of my co-workers also has this case and it is broken along the top band as well! If you use your belt clip a lot, this is not the case for you!"
2,De que se trata este grupo?,"Tu luz es una cancion buenisima pero no siempre vale la pena comprar un disco por una sola canción, cierto???, esa canción a mi parecer está divorciada del resto del disco.Volver a empezar es un tema digamos repetitititititititititivo, buen ritmo medio blues un poquin aburrido. y El disco total lo cambié por otro de Complices de España.Gracias."
2,A Very Disappointing End To A Great Series,"I've looked through every paragraph reference to find the 'real' ending, only to realise that the last depressing paragraph was in fact the real end. The book begins with some real promise by having the factor of Foxglove present, and it's good to revisit some characters from previous books. With such a promising start it's a pity the book didn't have another 400 or so paragraphs to take it forward. The ending strays away completely from the original quest and sounds like one of the bad endings where you die. Only a slight hint suggests that this would've been continued in a seventh book, but sadly I hear there isn't one. Perhaps the authors were given their marching orders and the book had to be finished unsatisfactorily? There's simply no other good reason why a great series like this should've ended like this. Very disappointing."
3,Inconclusive,"If this book weren't the last of the excellent ""Way of the Tiger"" ninja series, it would deserve 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, ""Inferno!"" seems to have been the final book of the series. The problem stems from the fact that the book's ""ending"" is not really an ending. The hero's main quest remains unfulfilled at the end, robbing the story, and the entire series for that matter, of a satisfying conclusion."
2,A Disturbing Book,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The storyline is garbled,confusing, and mixed with the consciousness of the protagonist. The characters are eccentric and not all endearing. It was a pain to turn each page. The book saved itself from being a door stopper because of the last chapter. It doesn't completely redeem itself, but it does bring order to the story. If you're a fan of Maxine Hong's read this at your own risk."
2,Very Disappointing,"I really do not want to write a bad review of Maxine Hong Kingston's work. Her ""Woman Warrior"" and ""China Men"" were wonderful. And she is a wonderful person. But that make me all the more disappointed with ""Tripmaster Monkey.""I am quite familiar with post-modern novels, and I find Milan Kundera's roaming meanders and flying leaps a very pleasant read. So my reaction is not to post-modern style but rather to her application of that style.There are so many layers upon heavy layers of self-indulgent baggage to plod through that reading the book became a nightmarish experience. I always try to read at least 100 pages of any book before abandoning it -- and I abandon books only very rarely. But after 68 pages of ""Tripmaster Monkey"", I simply could not go on, and I put it back on the shelf.I may someday try it again. But I doubt it."
3,"Good and loaded with philosophy, but too much weird.","This novel id loaded with lots of good insights into human nature and the American experience, especially during the sixties. Although I don't agree with much of what she says and I don't like jumping from the philosiphical to the weird, the weird seems to cheapen the philosophical. But the wierd does provide a good setup for the insights and the meat of the novel. I know missed a lot because I'm not familiar with chinese folklore."
4,"Dance all night, baby, dance all night","This is Paulina's most 'dance-oriented' album. Though I still feel that she has yet to top her 1993 release 24 KILATES, this is probably up there with her better albums. Standout tracks include Tu y Yo, Siempre Tuya Desde La Raíz, Sueño de Cristal and my personal favorite Solo Por Ti."
3,tssss <hot>,"This is a really hot Mexican chick who winds up being involved with some very popular dancy music. When I was a DJ in Tijuana I used to spin this stuff all the time. I still like to listen to it when I am in the mood for some very slick, sugary euro-disco. Superb production, but at times hard to believe because it is ""so well done."" Have you heard of the term ""over-produced?"" But this is what you play when you want to get things done; like get people dancing or whatever. Buy this for your next party. Your guest will love you; the neighbors will hate you. Lots of throbbing bass and sizzling trebble! Nice. Much more dancy for her than earlier efforts."
3,Great show.....however,"Cat Stevens is one of the best 70's artists, no doubt about it. I was very fortunate to be able to attend this concert when Cat came to Detroit. What a GREAT SHOW!! Many, many of his classics performed with a very unique twist of MAGIC. The downfall (hence my 3 stars), is the overkill on camera shot changes. WAY TOO MANY!Other than the annoying constant camera changes, the performance is a 5. Still, a must have for Cat Fans."
2,Mediocre at best except for the extras,"Honestly I was excited about this DVD thinking it would be a great show but all I left was two or three songs from an Old Grey Whistle show which are extras on this DVD. Remarkable, hardly. Cat had a very annoying habit of shaking his head from side to side which distracted from the show. I cannot believe this is all the footage they have of Cat Stevens. I still love his stuff but I'm not playing this concert again"
2,Cat Stevens....Disappointment!,"If you've read any of my reviews, you'll notice this is the first I've ever been disappointed with. I've owned Tea For The Tillerman, Teaser and the Firecat albums and enjoyed them for years.This concert tour was his last (before leaving music altogether and became Yousef the Muslim). I felt like the artist and the production fell well short of my expectations. I rated this as a 2 stars, ONLY for the song content.If I were to use one word to describe this DVD, it would be CHEESEY!"
3,Strange concert,"I rated ""three stars"" only because I was dissapointed with Cat Stevens singing, with his eyes closed most of the time.You would think he was blind!"
4,An excellent recording of a great artist,"I could have done without the retellling of history from the 70's during the intro, but this is an excellent recording of one of that period's greatest singer songwriters. It reminded me of how truly unique his voice was. I have so many wonderful memories associated with these songs and they stand up to the test of time.Product arrived a couple of days after Christmas with free shipping. I should have ordered sooner. I would recommend to any Cat Stevens fan."
5,A Long Awaited Treasure...,"I purchase many items through Amazon and especially enjoy music DVD's. I have longed for footage of Cat Stevens in concert for countless years. The wait was well worth it. I never expected such incredible audio and video from a dated concert (especially from an artist that is rarely seen). I have never written a review and am careful not to over emphasize quality but this DVD deserves the recognition. It may not be at today's standards but comes very close. It is also beautifully packaged, has great bonuses and is an incredible value. A must for any fan of late 60's through 70's music!!"
5,I was there!,"I attended the concert as a college freshman at William and Mary. I have always felt that it was the best concert that I've ever seen. The moment that Cat appeared, walking out of the boxes as part of a magic trick, has been etched in my memory for 30 years--it truly was an emotional experience to see it ""live"" 30 years later. The dvd is superb and allowed me to relive, with both joy and melencholy, the feeling of being in college in the 1970's."
2,British version,"I love spyfox, but to anyone about to buy this particular one, be aware that it is the british version..."
5,the funnest ride to hell you'll ever take,"from the opening chords of this masterpiece, you will know you're in for a treat. the guitars are a menacing aural assault that, backed by a relentless rhythm, forges a melody that is engaging and haunting. The shouts of the vocals seem relevant, although I can't say I understand the themes of many of the songs. That said, this is clearly an album made with...love.absolute favorite is the title track, which turns all in its path into smoldering embers. The whole album is great, though...quite possibly my favorite album"
4,rocket from the crypt/drive like jehu fans...BUY THIS NOW,"Eleven tracks of pure energy; I was a tad disappointed at the overall length of the CD (45 mins, with the obligatory 'dead silence' of ?? minutes, followed by a disappointing 'secret collection of sounds...). That's why I'm only giving 4/5. John Reis and company are a creative bunch in this day and age of rehashed sounds and copycat bands. BUY IT! It's a keeper."
4,"Speedo, you rule","Sick of the state of [bad] ""punk rock""? Listen to the Hot Snakes if you answered yes. The Hot Snakes combine the intensity and in your face rock of Drive Like Jehu, and the coolness of Rocket from the Crypt. (Speedo, aka John Reis was in Drive Like Jehu,and is currently in Rocket From the Crypt.)Some standout tracks here are ""If Credits What Matters..."", and ""Light Up the Stars."" The Hot Snakes are hard to compare to any other band (besides the two I mentioned above), but if I was going to make a comparison, I would say they are a ""hardcore Sonic Youth."" If you like any of those 3 bands, do yourself a favor, and check out the Hot Snakes. Watch out for their new record too."
1,I'm Confused,"I'm totally confused....I received an e-mail that said my order was cancelled because this item could not be obtained from any of Amazon sources...and now I'm asked to review it? I checked my order status and it says the item will ship after October 1. Huh?I've usually had good results in dealing with Amazon, but this time I'm at a total loss.Sorry, I wish I could have reviewed this DVD for you."
4,A Quick Read with Lots of Chuckles,"Hail to the king, baby! I'm not the biggest Bruce fan on the planet, but I do enjoy Evil Dead II and (horrors) III as well. This book was quite an enjoyable read and worth every penny. It shows you how insane you have to be to work in the movie industry, while at the same time giving you plenty of appreciation for that insanity."
3,More biography than behind-the-scenes...,"Despite the title, this book is more of a biography of Bruce Campbell the person than the behind the scenes look at a 'B' actor's career. It takes almost half the book before he gets to Hollywood and by then he's already known for the first 'Evil Dead' movie.Once he gets there (Hollywood), the book picks up pace and the anecdotes move along well. I enjoyed all of the info on the 2nd and 3rd Evil Dead movies, the Brisco County, Jr. series info and all of his bit parts. The 'how-to' section on acting didn't do much for me, but if you're interested in a life in Hollywood, its an informative read.All in all, a good read that unfortunately takes awhile to kick in."
5,Titles are hard to think up...........,"I haven't read this book yet, but wanted to throw a little piece of trivia out. Campbell was also the star of the best TV series that nobody has ever seen (IMHO) - The Adventures of Briscoe County, from about 10 years ago, or so. The man is a true character...... ;-)"
5,A goldmine for B movie directors,"I am a B movie director... I've finished My Firkin Family and am now working on Happy Firkin Birthday. This book is a wonderful motivator for a maniac with a camera and a dream. It also provides good ideas for how to make more out of no money during a shoot. It also provides a great read about Bruce Campbell, who is a wild and untamed thing."
5,Must have for the Bruce Campbell fan!,"If you're like me and are a huge Bruce Campbell fan, you'll probably Love this book, otherwise maybe not so much.This book might also be useful for an aspiring actor or author, as Bruce relates his personal experiences of trying to make it in the acting world, and also his experiences with getting this book published.Bruce Campbell is an American treasure. Buy his book."
5,A realistic bio of the everday hollywood player.,"I'm only half way through this bio. I started yesterday, and am already on chapter 23. Don't think that this book is thin, or a short read in any way shape or form...I just read so quickly because I couldn't put the thing down! Sure Bruce has high power, high profile friends (such as Sam Raimi, who is heading up the huge Spiderman project coming out), but he is still an everyday guy. His sarcasm and humor keep you turning the pages. A good read for anyone interested in any type of film career, a good biography, or anyone who just wants a few chuckles. I would have waited until I was done, to post my review, but I couldn't let this great book have no comments. Besides, even though I've only read a portion, that portion alone was worth the [price] that I spent on it.A great buy."
5,Hail to the King!,"Most people know Bruce Campbell from the Evil Dead trilogy. He is one of the most famous ""B"" Actors and probably has a following greater than most ""A"" Actors.Many people has complained that Mr. Campbell hardly discusses anything about the Evil Dead movies in this book. What you probably don't know is that this book is a biographie of the man and his career, from his first super8 films to present.If you wish to know about the Evil Dead, be sure to pick the ""Evil Dead Companion""."
5,Campbell,"I eagerly awaited the release of this memoir and was not disappointed. Campbell hits a home run describing his life and times. For those who enjoyed Campbell's tour de force performances in the Evil Dead series and subsequent roles in McHale's Navy, Hudsucker Proxy, and Spider Man, this serves as the perfect complement. I hope that Bruce will someday consider a follow-up."
5,If Chins Could Kill Definetely Delivers!!,"As an advid Bruce Campbell fan, like others I couldnt wait for the release of this book, I counted down the days until it was finally here. ""If Chins Could Kill, Confessions Of A B-Movie Actor"" is a tale of humor, fame, and the not so glorious side of Hollywood. You will read about Bruce's adventures with his brothers as a child, his unique relationship with Sam Raimi, and of course..The Evil Dead Films. Bruce comes across as an honest man just telling it how it is, this book had a riot of laughs, but also hits a sensitive side showing how dark Hollywood can be. This book is a must read, 5 out of 5 stars...Heres to Bruce being on the best sellers list!!"
4,Bruce Campbell is my hero.,"I've been a fan of Bruce's for a long time, so I was eager to read his autobiography. I laughed out loud several times throughout this book, and I don't usually laugh outloud while reading (Except for David Sedaris stories). My only criticism is that towards the end of the book the writing loses some of it's humor and it's edge. I think this is partially attributable to his relating events as they are happening in his real life, rather than looking back and being able to make observations on the events. Overall a great read, but the anticlimatic (almost boring) ending kept it from getting 5 stars."
5,Campbell is Great,"If Chins Could Kill, is a great biography. I loved Bruce Campbell and I loved the book. He shares his past pasionatlly with you as he talks about his carear. There is a great part about the Evil Dead, which he co-produced with Sam Raimi. He talks about other details of his life and you get to know him a little better. Bruce is one of my all time favorite actors. He uses sarcasm well which I love, and he's believabe. He's not the greatest actor in the world and will never win an oscar, but he's one of the few actors that is like me and you. If you love Bruce Campbell you will love this book. If you have no idea who he is, you still probaly will. Don't miss out on it."
5,"From Evil Dead to Xena, one great actor!","This book is humorous and depicts the life of Bruce Campbell. Once you read it you will have a newfound respect for him and other ""B"" actors. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. You won't be dissapointed."
5,"""groovy""",this book is awesome i brought it and read it in one week acually twice. well this book is great for all you campbell fans you'll know hes so funny and just bruce. buy it read it and when he comes to your area go get it signed!!!!
5,Bruce is the man,"This is a great story of a guy who didnt fall into temptation of drugs and alcohol,and didnt give up when the chips were down. Bruce is a class act. His story is nothing but uplifting,even with all the bad breaks,Bruce drove on and on.The tales of making evil dead were fantastic even with a recipe for fake blood. Loaded with photo's with funny captions underneath,drawings,car bills,and whole lot more. Very easy to read because of the humor involved from Bruce. A class act in a classless world."
5,Oldschool Bruce,"Bruce really had somthing going for him while acting in Evil Dead...his chin. This semi-autobiography is testament to the fact that struggling at somthing you really want to do with your life will someday payoff with a lot of hard work, dedication and a high tolerance for burning hot latex. YOUCH! I recomend this book not simply for the fact that it is a fun read but moreso the fact that Bruce is the man."
4,A chin with alot of wit,"What a great read. I laughed constantly and kept pestering friends by holding sections of the book under their noses so they could laugh too. It is a hilarious, dry look at the workings of a money driven business powered on the backs of creative ""genius"". I have since passed it on to several friends and they have enjoyed it as much as I have."
5,The unsung heroes of Holliwood,"Bruce Campbell made me realize how the REAL heroes of film business, are the backstage people. People like himself, like Ron Howard, like Rob Tapert... It's also lots of fun :)"
2,"Great sound, but poor fit","Though there are three sizes, none of these eartips fit me well. They keep falling off. The voice clarity is good, but only when the earpiece is firmly in the ear."
5,Great product,I have been looking for a replacement cushion for my beloved 510. This product is inexpensived and is the factory pieces that fit well. People tell me the windscreen works quite well when out in the wind.Plantronics has winning product with the 510.
3,exxcellant a littel slow on shipping,"The product was exactly as described, The slearer the item took avery long term to ship the item and once it arrived I wass pleaseed. i was happy with with,"
3,I returned it as it would not pick up the Bluetooth signal from my device or my device did not send one.,I own an iPod Touch which has bluetooth that I wanted to use for a headset instead of the earbuds with wires. I can't make a judgement about the Voyager headset. I think I just made an error about the use of bluetooth on my device.
2,Cone Windscreenc For The Voyager 510 Headset,Voyager Windscreen come two in the package. I have only one left becasue the windscreen cone comes off when the jacket gets taken off when the headset is in the holster. I thank that i may have to glue it on the headset.
2,outdated,"I am sure this was a great book to have a few years ago. Although well written and concise, It is now 10 years old and seriously outdated. There is nothing in here that you could not easily find for free on the internet. All of the publishers have easily accessible author submission guidelines that can be downloaded for free. All of the ""helpful hints"" are available online as well, with many articles and blogs that can offer guidance and support to would be writers. It would be great if this author put out an updated copy. Until then, don't waste your money on this book."
4,J.P.,"This camera packs a lot of good features for the price. 5x7 prints that I printed via ifoto.com, were very good. I have taken lots of pictures indoors and outdoors, and all of them turned out to be great. The only problem with this camera is that in low light conditions such as indoors and at night, if you do not use flash, the pictures turn out to be blurry and out of focus eventhough there was ample light. But with flash picutres turn out to be very good. Overall I am happy with the camera. I would definitely recommend this camera for the beginner."
1,This book is wrong.,"I was seriously excluded as a child. I wanted to like this book, but this book is wrong.When play is commanded and compulsory -- when you *must* play with someone -- it ceases to be play.To be played with out of a sense of duty -- because a teacher or a rule-book or a story-book so commanded, NOT because anyone actually wanted to -- would have hurt me even worse than not being played with at all."
5,Loved it!,"This book expresses what many of us know inherently, but Paley finds a way to say it, to bring it into your conscience, and to do it with a lyricism that is her writing ""voice."" It makes me wish she were my Kindergarten teacher...well, not really, since I still love my dear Mrs. Shabay and Miss Reezak!If you're a teacher or a parent, the focus is on what is important about play, and most especially, the KINDS of play kids engage in. Makes me want to set up a ""dress up"" room in my house - - and I don't even have kids yet!"
4,You Can't Say You Can't Play,An excellent exploration of why and when children begin the process of exclusion in the most basic exercise: play. The book is an insightfull review of how the children struggled with balancing the ideal that all people are equal against the a fundamental right that all children have learned: they have the right to choose who they play with.
2,"Great idea, but went awry in Magpie Land....","This book was an eye-opener for me. I would recommend it to other educators who are noticing certain children being ostracized or ignored. Afterall, who wouldn't want all children to feel included in their class? Unfortunately, because of these good intentions we may have also unknowingly put more focus onto the alienated child. In the future, I will use this question as a springboard for discussion about playground etiquette to hopefully guide them to inclusive play outside of the class. I began reading this book with high expectations and overall the explanation/examples were helpful. However, as for Magpie and the other fantasy friends, my interest was lost and I found that it was harder to digest than the overall story itself. So, other than those vignettes, the book was a decent read."
1,Instant music,"As I am traveling, I have not had the oportunity to try out the RDX-150-EF. As soon as I do hook it up, I will go to the product and rate it."
1,"good idea, bad software and support","I wish I would have read the reviews first before buying. I got the version for MAC and it has been three frustrating days now and still no copy of my tapes to CD. Although it took some time to figure out how to get it to work, I have been able to make a music file and save it on my hard drive. However I cannot get the file to burn to CD, go to itunes or export in any manner,nor can I register the product or get any customer support. I can't even send to ""toast"" as it wants me to purchase a new copy for $100 more dollars.The key code on the cd sleeve always says wrong id number when entered. The Phone number on the web site has a recording that says I've reached the wrong line and hangs up. And there is no answer to emails that i've sent. I've decided to take the item back. I'm sorry to say It hasn't been worth any of the time invested."
3,"Works well enough, but not for the weak.","Instant Music doesn't exactly live up to its title -- it took two installs to get it to work with my system, and a lot of experimenting to figure out exactly what was going on and how to accomplish what I wanted to do -- but it is a fairly good and inexpensive way to convert LPs and cassettes to CDs or digital files.Everything the other posters have said about the printed and digital documentation, and help files, is true -- ADS Tech certainly isn't spending their money on the best technical writers available. But the software is pretty sophisticated and easy enough to use for someone with a fair amount of computer experience and patience. The de-click and de-crackle settings are especially good and, fortunately, pretty simple to figure out.If you're the proud owner of a vinyl or cassette collection who's got more time than money, ADS Tech's Instant Music will reward your investment of both."
3,LP to CD,"This device did the job. However, I actually had to buy a turntable and new amplifier to use with it. I think there are products out there that do it all in one package and which would be that much easier to use. It would've been a shame to loose all the music that I had collected over decades, so I am glad that I did convert the albums which I did. However, because the process required that I get out all the pieces of equipment that I mentioned above, along with my laptop, it isn't a job that I eagerly do as much as I should."
2,Customer Beware,"1. This is advertised as a simple way to transfer old record disks onto CDs. Not quite true.2. A separate preamp is needed but is only indicated in a small, added-on sticker on the box.3. The only thing that ADS provides is a an electronic box that easily allows connection to a USB port on your computer.4. The software provided is by Nero and is very difficult to use.5. Volume controls on the software do not really work adequately."
2,Tedious and Not worth the time,If you are looking to make MP3's from LP's and Cassettes like me...don't waste your time with this product unless you have patience for watching the application crash after you spent 15 minutes recording a song on an LP. Not to mention the details of configuring the MP3's not to be 64MBytes for a 3 minute song.The hardware works great but Ahead Nero dropped the ball on this one! Their software dances around and does not give a quick solution to making MP3's.This is a cheapo crap-o alternative to a $300.00 program called Sonar Cakewalk which does the same thing with the soundcard.
4,Naysayers are wrong!,"After reading all of the negative reviews of the ADS Technologies RDX-150 Instant Music recorder, I was very skeptical, but knew that I could return the device to Amazon without hassle. First installation was a bit difficult, but most likely it was user error. Second time around, the device worked as promised. No static, no hum, just a great reproduction of one of my library of cassettes gathering dust. Haven't tried burning CDs from LPs. That will be my next challenge."
3,Not too bad,"I've been using this for a few days and haven't encountered many problems. I'm not too fond of the buzzing hum during the digital monitoring. I was going to buy a pre-amp for the turntable but settled for RCA jacks instead, figured I could run them from my hi-fi into InstantMusic but not a sound was produced. Well, instead I used the rca jacks on the turntable and plugged it directly into the InstantMusic and it works fine, all I do is tweak the volume some after the recording is completed. It is important to save the files right after recording before tweaking anything because the Nero software will crash, especially during Noise Reduction. Other than that it works just fine. It's not compatible with Roxio Media though, which is what I prefer using."
3,ADS Tech RDS-150,"Well, it works in the sense that there are analog inputs (left and right channel RCA plugs) for hooking up your old tape or vinyl player to transmit the audio to your PC via USB output. However, there is no software to accommodate the recording. So, you have to come up with your own. I'd found a great program on-line called Audacity which is free and works wonderfully for the aforementioned purpose. It's worth the price if all you want to digitize your old analog record or tape collections."
4,Works as advertised,I read several reviews before I purchased this product with a common theme being the software being an issue. I had no issues with the software. Maybe they improved it. But it's very easy to use and I'm happy with my purchase.
4,Good Product with Great Software,"I received a turntable for Christmas that would not interface well with my laptop due to the limited connection options my laptop offered. That was my primary reason for purchasing this product. While the product hardware performed as expected, I was VERY happy with the software bundle that came with the product. The ""Spin It Again"" software made record and tape transfer very easy.The only frustration I had was in getting the monitor mode to work. I had to play with the settings to select the proper sound card for recording and a different soundcard for playback.Good product."
3,ADS INSTANT MUSIC,"The ADS Instant Music adapter does provide better recorded sound quality than you get by using the line-in or the microphone port. One major drawback is that it doesn't feed the input through to the PC speakers so the sound can be monitored. The input signal is recognized only by the recording software. This makes it very difficult to determine when to start and stop the recording, unless you have another device to monitor the input."
3,"LP, Cassette audio converter","I have mixed opinions about this product, evidently I am not smart enough to use it. The Nero program is not very clear. Windows XP did not outright say it recognized the hardware, so I was able to use the audio cords provided and run from the LP,Cassette player to the sound Card and use third party software to accomplish the task."
3,it's not easy but it does work,It will take alot of patience and you need to get the upgrade...and it will take a few hours of playing with it...but once you figure it out it will work....anyone know of an easier way?
3,It Works But A Flawed Design,"I bought this after e-mailing ADS Tech support, I asked if the ""static/noise"" problem had been fixed & he assured me it was (the unit I have seems fine thus far). The gripes I have is that the manual is poor & though I didnt have any problem setting it up others might. The unit comes with an adapter that has 2 RCA jacks to a ""female"" mini jack, this is useless unless you have a male to male cable (which I do). The other things to note are the green LED (S/PDIF) stays on all the time signal or not even though the manual states if there is no signal the light wil ""go on & off"" (if I recall another review mentioned this as well). Also the hardware offers no input level adjustment. Anyway I was able to copy an old LP to my computer & burn & CD that sounded as good (or bad) as the original & for $40 it will serve my needs."
2,Hardware has potential but software is terrible,"The Nero software that comes bundled with the ADS Instant Music is terrible. It crashes my computer immediately about 50% of the time when I try to start a recording project. The program also crashes immediately if I try to start a new recording after finishing one, forcing me to reboot between every side/take. The software interface is not very intuitive, and the very limited documentation that came in the package was really not helpful. The audio quality is pretty decent, but every once in a while a skip will show up for no apparent reason, forcing me to re-record a song.On the plus side the device was relatively inexpensive.The device does work but using it is a big hassle. It could have been a real winner if they had made better software for it."
5,VERY EASY BABY BOOK,This is a really fabulous and easy way to track your baby's first year of life. My daughter is now in her 12th month and I'm still writing in this journal on a weekly basis. It seems so often I hear from other mothers that they didn't keep up with the baby books. This journal makes it so easy--have I said that enough? Even if you're not into journaling I would consider buying this book. I'm going to buy it as a shower gift for any friends I have becoming a new mom.
2,Would Not Buy Again,"I bought this with high hopes after reading the reviews. I was hoping it would be something I could give to my daughter when she was older. However, some of the questions (such as ""how are you feeling about your postpartum body?"" or something like that) are things that I wouldn't want her to read. Also, questions are very redundant from week to week. It's difficult to write on the left side of this book due to the spiral binding - a 3-ring binder would be better where we could remove pages, write, and then put them back. I also found it difficult to respond to some questions and on others, I ran out of room too soon. It just wasn't a good fit for me - I stopped using it after 2 months and am much happier with a more traditional baby book!"
4,Stupid Funny,Corny jokes and stupid humor galore. Funnier now then it was on TV. Robin Williams is great.
1,NO!!!!!!!!,"UGH! What were they thinking??!From the depths of Hades comes this ""comedy"" that introduced NANU-NANU into the lexicon of stupidness. Oh isn't Robin Williams so funny. look at him hatch out of an egg, check him out drinking juice from hsi finger, blah blah blah."
4,Kids love Robin Williams !,"I was searching TIVO for years looking for episodes of Mork & Mindy, without luck. I knew my 12 year old son would love this show, and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.Kids of all ages know who Robin Williams is, and he was at his absolute best in this show.And as I guessed, my son thinks this show is absolutely hilarious. I remember in later years they ran out of ideas and the plots were a real stretch, but the first season was phenominal.Give your kids a surprise, and get this box set.They will love it !"
4,"Dated, but Adorable","At first glance, it is easy to see that ""Mork and Mindy"" is an older show. That said, it is still fun to watch even today.Robin Williams, of course, is the clear star of the show: comic brilliance. He adds so much to the character - his voices, faces, physical humor - no one else could have played this part.The character of Mork is brilliantly written - less as an alien and more as a very naive human. He's juxtaposed by a free-thinking, accepting college student, and her conservative, suspicious father. Their interactions actually say a lot about our society as Mork learns what it means to be an Earthling.The packaging and digital remastering of the show it very sharp; I may not watch it every day, but I will cherish it as a part of my collection!"
4,Mork and Mindy old TV show,"Silly as ever, good for a lot of laughs - Robin Williams' first TV gig - you can see the beginnings of many of his gags and routines. Nanu, nanu!"
2,Cut out the best parts!,This movie was hilarious but this cut does not include some of the funniest scenes and added a really stupid dream sequence (I usually love dream sequences!). Boo!
5,A Year LAter We're Still Reading This,"I purchased this book close to a year ago for my son's 8th birthday. He loved it, and he continues to regularly read the book. Also, he has developed an interest in birds and birdwatching. This was a great purchase and I recommend it. Now I am shopping for his 9th birthday and am looking for aome Audubon prints for him."
3,You know you're Somebody when A&E profiles you,"Like other A&E Biographies, this short, sweet documentary about the great Stone Face is more flattering than fascinating. The narrative touches on all the usual stories of Buster Keaton's remarkable life and career - from the childhood spill that got him his name to the crazy pratfalls that made him a silent star - but glosses over his all too human shortcomings. (I'm always impressed by how A&E manages to make problems like alcoholism and depression seem shallow and easily surmountable.) But these are small complaints; with a subject like Buster, even this generic treatment is enjoyable. Well worth the watch for casual fans and serious scholars alike, but if you want to get the most for your pennies buy the wonderful, in-depth BBC set Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow, and tape this A&E Bio from the t.v. Damfino!"
2,is this truly the best we can get,"we purchased this dvd player a year ago and have not been pleased since we first began using it. it freezes on the majority of our dvd's, both rentals and new, and now it refuses to play any dvd's or cd's at all. we are looking for a new dvd player and in looking at other reviews it seems that a variety of dvd players and all brands are subject to these problems. i hate to think this is the way of the future. videos seem so much easier to use."
1,Junk,"Disappointed doesn't begin to describe it. This thing was useless until I duct-taped the top and bottom of the pole together.It's advertised as having an adjustable height but the nut that is supposed to hold the top part of the pole in place doesn't work. The top just slides down into the hollow bottom, so the only way to get the pole to the proper height is to tape it in place (I can't yet say how long the tape will hold). I would have sent it back for replacement, but I need it to give my cat subQ fluids and it's better than nothing. Barely."
2,Cheap junk from China is cheap junk from China,"Product arrived with 2 of the wheels cracked. The constrction on the pole is ok, the wheels are terrible. You get what you pay for; cheap chinese made junk is cheap. No suprise. You more or less get what you pay for here."
4,Good IV pole,"Easy to put together. There was no directions how to put it together, but it is easy to figure out. Rolls great on hardwood floor."
5,A wonderful product!,"Like others, I bought this iv pole to give my cat fluids. It's a wonderful product, well built, sturdy, rolls easily into whatever room I need it. The price can't be beat and I couldn't be more pleased."
5,Awesome True Crime book!,Harold Schechter is by far one of the best True Crime writers. He presents thorough research and makes every sentence interesting. All of his true crime books are worth reading!
2,There seems to be some false information,"This book is definitely a good read but the fact that I found some false info earned it two stars. How can I trust this information if I know that it can be false? The falsehood I stumbled across was on page 201. Schechter is describing Jeffery Dahmer and states rather boldly that he took pleasure in ""killing small animals"". Dahmer did not kill or otherwise torture animals. I'd recommend this book for discovering and learning the basics of serial killers. If one takes your fancy then there are well researched biographies out there (like Brian Masters' on Dahmer). I agree that Schecter comes off as biased and for me, it's rather obnoxious and repetitive. His style is garish and sensationalist. It's as if he intended the reader to think the absolute worst of the killer."
1,too repetitve,The book should have been shorter. But do to its repetitive mention of certain famous serial killers made it longer. If the author would have given all the details of those case up front instead of spacing them through out the book. It would had been a more interesting read.
3,serial killer files,this book is a good source of info but it jumps around alot. i found it frustrating that the author kept reffering to other sks while talking about another.
5,history of serial killers,"This is without any doubt one of the most informative books on the history of serial killers. Schechters writing style is so fluid that it's hard to put the book down. Around 150 - 200 serial killers are discussed in the book, which means that Schechter also mentions the lesser known serial killers, like Javed Iqbal and Li Wenxian. It's interesting to read that serial killers aren't a phenomenon of the last 150 years. Schechter proves that by going back to ancient Rome and the middle ages.Who, what, where, how en why ... You will find the answer in this book. Excellent for true crime addicts. 5 star"
5,Excellent--a necessity,"I have been an enthusiast of serial killer literature for years and years, and I can confidently say that this book will now be the singular resource on serial killers. It is comprehensive, well-written, and perfectly executed. It satisfied all of the questions I have had about serial killers. Full of informations, interesting, engaging--anyone with an interest similar to mine should definitely buy this book!!"
4,"Pretty good,some minor faults","This book is pretty good. Its detailed and well organized by sections. I would reccomend it to others, espcially if you buy it at the 'used' price. However I will say that it gets a bit annoying that practicly EVERY OTHER KILLER in the book is stated to be ""arguably the most prolific serial killer' or something along those lines. Yes, we get that some killed many more than others, but when you read ""most prolific killer"" under twenty different killers, its hard to take that claim seriously anymore. But otherwise its a pretty decent book."
5,Great book.,"I bought this as a gift for my little brother and he didn't put it down for a week. It offered detailed accounts of some of the most gruesome crimes, and some insight into the person's experience of what made them commit such an audacity. Very interesting, my brother recommends it."
1,A book which I gave up after 2 pages,I very rarely ever give up on a book and this one has to have been my quickest ever. If you are in a book shop and you are tempted into buying this book I suggest that you read the first two pages and if you are not put off then you may enjoy it. I just found the opening did not make sense and I skimmed ahead and did not find anything to make me want to read more.
1,This will always be on backorder at Amazon,Amazon continues to list out of print Wizards of the Coast D&D. They did the same thing with Harbinger starter sets a short time ago. When you place an order they keep pushing the due date back. Why do they bother listing stuff they have no way of getting?
2,this video sucks!,"I know that's an awful thing to say, but it's true because Helen Kane, the REAL inspiration for Betty Boop, wasn't even mentioned!the biography made it as though the Fleischers made up the Betty character out of the clear blue sky.And then also, someone metioned in this biography that Pudgy the Dog was favored over Bimbo? No way, Pudgy was just a yappy dog-Bimbo rocks, he had character, long live Bimbo and Koko!but I do have to give this tape some credit over the history of the Fleichers animation techniques including invention of the 'rotoscope.' cool"
1,poor quality,CAmera came without memory car was not at all as represented missing other parts needed to use camera. It appeared to me that they just sent out to mea camera that had been returned without even looking at it.
5,Arthropod Bioacoustics: Neurobiology and Behaviour,"This is a great book with 260 pages, many figures, photos, drawings/diagrams and oscillographs. The chapter titles are as follows: Biophysics of Sound and Vibration; Mechanisms of Sound Production; Receptor Mechanisms; Neuroethology of Sound Reception; Neuroethology of Sound Production; The Functions of Arthropod Sound; Intraspecific Acoustic Communication: Calling Songs; Song in Courtship and Aggression; Acoustic Communication in Social Arthropods; Genetics and Evolution of Song; Bioacoustic Methods. Some of the arthropods included come from the following groups: Gryllidae, Acrididae, Tettigonidae, Diptera (Drosophila), Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Arachnida and Crustacea."
2,our favorite religeous singer,for a singer in his eighties this is outstanding.but following his older recordings this is naturally a comedown.better to stay with his recordings prior to 2000.hes still remarkably good but stick to his earlier recordings.
4,Great classic Gaither Christmas DVD,"Christmas in the country is a great classic in the Gaither's homecoming series, it contains many well known songs as well as some lesser known songs. The performers are all top artists who have deserved their place in the southern gospel music field."
4,Good Voice -- Good Man,Really enjoyed this album. I loved to see his family and home and he seems genuine in his faith. That makes me like his music even more. The music is found on other albums but put on this DVD in a nice package.
5,I like this product,The item arrived promptly and intact. What more can I say? Easier than driving to the mall to pick it up!
4,Best Eye Cream I've Found,"Have been looking for an under the eye cream that helps soften my age/sun/squint lines some......this stuff seems to be the best one i've found so far.........small bottle but lasts a long time, goes on just fine (no sensitivity issues) and seems to make some of the wrinkles soften up a bit........i like that it's a pump and not in a jar also........will definitely reorder this when i'm done with my bottle now......"
1,totally defective,"One star is too generous., as I could not even use the product. The pump mechanism was defective....could not get it to operate. Next time I will buy the item in a department store"
3,Good for the price,"I wish it held more water, and I needed to carve off a portion of the trunk to fit it into the 6"" hole. However it held a big tree up just fine."
5,Muy buena recopilacion,Un buen disco con las mejores canciones de los prisioneros. Esta banda chilena si que fue lo mejor que exporto Chile. Lo recomiendo como un clasico para aquellos que gustan del buen Rock en espanol.
5,Best collar ever,"Can't say enough good about this collar. I have 2 giant schnauzers and the glothat this collar gives off is just enough that you can see them at night in theyard, plus if all the lights are off in the house. I have used these collars overthe years with my other dogs also. Couldn't fine them anywhere else but at Amazon.com. Silly me I should have looked here first. Amazon has everything aperson ever needs for their pets. Thank you Amazon.Sincerely,A very happy pet owner."
2,Not Reflective Or Glow in the Dark!,"This collar is a standard collar, but with a thin strip of ""Glow in the dark/Reflective material"". Only problem is that the strip only covers about 30% of the collar, not the entire length. After putting it on our 15# Border Terrier, the strip was on her side and almost facing straight down, which is of no use for keeping her visible to traffic. We let it sit in the light for 24 hours and then brought it in a dark room. You could barely see it when it wasn't on the dog, and could not see it at all once we put it on her. Her short fur covers some, and with it pointing down, the visible part was minimal, and very dim. After shining a flashlight on her in the dark room, we didn't see it as being reflective at all. The only plus is that the collar is pretty sturdy and the bright orange color may help during the day, but useless at night or early evening. We are returning this collar and looking for something else."
2,not effective for long haired dogs.,"I bought this for my black haired part lab dog, whom I keep tripping over at night. At least for my dog, this collar is useless. Her hair covers up the glow-in-the-dark strip and so I still trip over her. This would probably be a good product for a short haired dog, but for my medium length haired dog, it's useless."
4,I wish it could have gotten five stars,"but I couldn't give it all five.Sure its well researched & written but the subject forces the book to become repetitive no monsters found & all the lakes have the same results when the sightings are investigated. Except for the giant frog, once you've read the first couple of chapters you may as well skip to the conclusion."
3,aspect ratio problem,"The subject matter and acting is fine.The DVD itself is an example of a problem occasionally seen with DVDs of films made for TV. None of the choices of aspect ratio on my wide-screen HD TV are correct.This is similar to the usual problem of a hotel room with a wide-screen TV connected to a standard-definition cable service subscription; the hotel remote control offers no way to change the aspect ratio. I think of it as the ""fat-head"" syndrome."
5,Behind the Red Door,"I enjoyed this movie so much. I love all three of leads in this movie. Kiefer Sutherland is my favorite male actor because he is so fine to look at and portrays his characters so well. I could believe he was gay and not once did I think Jack Bauer, even when he was angry.I cried so hard for him."
4,book purchase,this is a book I read 50 yrs. ago and have been looking for quite some time. It was a great read then and I wanted to see why I was so impressed with it so long ago. I have just started reading it but think there was good reason why I remembered it as being a good read.
1,jokers,"Shame on amazon for even selling this. This sis the very reason I always had something against boston Hardcore. A bunch of thugs and jerks trying to prove they could be as cool or tough as NYHC kids. Let me get this straight, you started to get rid of the Nazis at shows because they came and messed the shows up for everyone and tried to intimidate people. FSU goes to shows and wants to enforce their way on everybody and will beat down anybody that doesn't agree. Hmmm sounds familiar. Hardcore was about proving to the outside world that there was a different way of doing things and a rejection of the status quo. I fail to understand how beating people up and not allowing free speech or thought is any different. Half the people in the interviews are smoking, there goes the whole straight edge thing. If you actually care about punk/hardcore this movie will make you sick that these people have no regard for anybody but themselves. bunch of Bullies that can't have an individual thought."
2,Waste of destrucitve energy,"This claims to show the vibrancy of the Boston hardcore scene. Actually it teeters between being silly and incongruous (ie Why are 99% of these fights outside posh Lansdowne Street nightclubs? What's with the footage of the 2004 Red Sox riots at UMASS AMHERST?) and downright chilling (shot of a bathroom floor with 4 or 5 pairs of complicit stationary feet and a kid getting his face kicked in). Kudos to the FSU for ""cleansing"" the Boston scene of Nazis 10 years ago, but it's time to move on."
3,Not Enough,"Although very real, it felt incomplete. It only gave a glimpse of the real hardcore culture and was riddled with bull about society. The real hardcore scene is very violent but with reason and logic behind each punch. Hardcore is ultimately about living life the best you can, the purest you can, and fighting for and adoring friends and family. There in lies the fallacy of the film, they show the crew (FSU)but not the motive. They are made out to be, well gang bangers, and in fact FSU may have turned that way that is not where the roots are that is not where it started, what it is, or what it used to be. Friends Stand United, not this jump an old man stuff but fight for beliefs. SIN crew forever (strength in numbers) no fooling around with gangs but having fun and protection those who cant do it themselves or those who are overwhelmed"
4,Goood,"This DVD is a great view on the Boston Hrdcore scene. The bands are great and the fights are even better! No weak love songs here, just raw in your face kick-your-ass Hardcore. Be sure to pick up a copy it'll definitly be worth the 13 bucks and 48 cents you stole from your mommy's purse."
1,Easily breaks.,Not worth it. I've bought two for my relatives overseas. They get power outages. Broke both on the handle to crank. Flimsy design.
5,Bought 5 copies,I love this CD so much that I had to buy extras for my friends. I love every song on this CD!
2,This is the first Millie's dance/balada album.,"Well, the other production (sola) is much better. She is a wonderful woman, but a average singer. I think it would be nice if she stop the dance and dedicate herself totally for the romantic stuff."
5,Curiosity led me to this...,"I'm not from Canada, but I do live about 45 miles from the Canadian border. If I remember correctly there is a Dieppe memorial park in Windsor, so I was always curious about the Dieppe raid. From what I understood it was a colossal messup and this movie seems to reinforce that. Dieppe makes the Arnhem thing look like a stroke of genius. It seems that everything was indicating this was going to be a colossal failure but the people in charge of the operation weren't paying attention, except for the Canadians. Anyways, it was nice to see a movie that showed some other belligerents besides the US, Britain, Germany and Russia. The DVD itself was a pretty good transfer, the picture was nice and crisp and the sound was pretty good for being made for TV. I wish US TV would do more stuff like this."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"Although Initial Setup was Fairly Easy for some reason I couldn't get a signal off the RF Connector It Latter Resolved Itself, Pay Attention to the formats You Can And Can't Use. I Made the Mistake of Buying DVD+RW Wrong, DVD-RW Are Supported. It say's That it will not Support VCD But Does. Picture Quility Recording off Air is Great, S-video Even Better, Over all It is a good Buy."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"I have owned my machine for 3+ years now, and have had no real complaints. I have burned nearly 1000 dvds with it, and it still works great! I would like to have an option to build my own disk menus, but this is a feature I have not seen on any model. If this DVD Recorder had an internal hard drive, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,so far so good,"I burn't about 100 DVDS so far and it it is holding up well. Samsung its self is like most companies with support, it depends who you talk to on any given day. Sometimes great and others not so great."
1,Cosmi SCAM!,"The ""Card Games"" CD Rom from Cosmi doesn't work with Windows 7. This wasn't listed on the packaging so buyer beware.Given the lack of technical compatability, I am giving this one star and don't recommend to anyone."
5,Excellent philosophy,We simplified our lives before I read this book - only because we lost our house and had nowhere to live. Everything we own is now sitting in a 10'x 10' storage unit. This was depressing - until I read this book and realized that everything we own - are the things I loved most. I gave away everything else. Now when we again own a house - I will only replace the things we NEED and LOVE. Not just to fill up space. Thank you again for writing this book
3,if you need it...,"This book is full of basic tips on how you can live a more simple and beautiful life. If you are coming from a crazy busy life, this book might be great for you! If you are already living a pretty simple, relaxed, non-materialistic life, you won't find much that is useful in this book."
4,living the simple life; A guide to scaling down and enjoying more,"Just the idea of such a book is so soothing and the reality of it is so hopeful, and just in time. Love it;consult it everday. Nancy"
4,Simple Easy-To-Read Advice for everyday situations.,"Personally, I see nothing wrong with Mrs. James book. I'm quite disturbed by the way people have slammed it summing it up as ""an article"". Obviously, those people were somewhat angered by her way of thinking. My guess is they are not ready to face their own challenges and demons.On the other hand, perhaps they simply do not wish to simplify their lives, and that is their choice. Some are minimalists and some are not.Yet, that is the way of the world, disgard what makes one uncomfortable.Perhaps, a reader should just take this book for what it is, practical little observations on everyday joys to help inspire one to at least start cleaning up their lives.It seems so ironic that some people would want a complicated book on how to simplify!In short, do not buy this book if you are looking to read a great analytical work of academa! Instead, only buy this book if you want a fun true-to-everyday life helpful read.I loved it!"
3,gets me thinking...,"this is an easy book to read through fairly quickly. i've had it for a while but recently decided to revisit it. i'm getting some ideas from it and it's making me think about how i could live more simply. i think you have to come up with your own idea of what simple living means to you but this book helps you think of your underlying motivations. it's not a workplan it's more a thought starter, it's not super deep but it is informative. this book is several years old and i'm sure there are other more current books on the topic."
5,you'll learn how to be more productive at work,"Just heard LIVING THE SIMPLE LIFE, authored and readby Elaine St. James (a best-selling author of two otherbooks I recently enjoyed, INNER SIMPLICITY andSIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE) . . . LIVING seems to put allher previous ideas together into one complete blueprintfor success and fulfillment . . . you'll learn how to be moreproductive at work, ignite creativity and find time to explorenew challenges . . . the book is another excellent contributionto what is becoming an ever-widening collection that shouldprove indispensable to anybody that thinks he or she hastoo much to do.There were many worthwhile suggestions; among them:A good exercise is to sit down and go through all the major areasof your life and decide how each would be different if the onlyperson was you [that you had to be concerned about].Resign from any organization whose meetings you dread.It's helpful to figure out what you don't want with you life . . . .andthen move to eliminate it."
2,"Another recovering yuppie who has found ""religion""","St. James has a lot of good advice here in a marketable ""chicken soup"" style presentation, but a major weakness is that the book seems slanted to the needs of recovering yuppies who have their loot already and can afford to slow down. I guess from a marketing standpoint that is a strength because those are the people who regularly buy books like this one. Voluntary simplicity is a different story for young people just starting out who haven't made enough money to qualify for the first home, or accumulated enough to even consider semi-retirement. For such people, the simple life often demands significant ""sacrifices"" such as conventional career success and social status. If the simplicity movement is to have any sort of long term credibility, there needs to be more books from authors other than the likes of St. James, people who have truly paid the economic price for the soul-enlarging blessings of simplicity."
2,I feel ripped off,"I bought ""Simplify Your Life"" by Elaine St. James and I loved it.. so naturally, I thought this would be a good purchase.. it's EXACTLY the same thing!! So yes, I feel like she ripped me off and added to the ""clutter"" in my bookshelf by trying to meet some sort of publishing quota"
2,Living the Simple Life,"Elaine St. James offers many practical tips to simplfy your life. Many are just plain common sense. Whilst reading her book, I couldn't get over the feeling that the author seems to be lacking spiritual depth in her commitment to the simple life. She and her husband Gibbs, seem to be very wrapped up in their little world. They both have already achieved financial success with their careers; its obvious they are not hurting for money. They have already lived in the fancy house, driven the luxury car, worn the designer clothes and got tired of all the trappings. I do not dispute that many of the authors suggestions are worthwhile and offer the reader some food for thought, however I think if you are looking for a book that deals with simplicity on more of a spirtual path, I would look elsewhere."
4,24/7 isn't normal!!,"That could be the subtitle of this and St. James other Simplify books.Advertising, media, and our culture train bad habits into us, draining our energy, creativity, finances, and, in general, cluttering our lives with ""stuff.""I liked this book and felt, by the end, I ""knew"" the author (and I liked her, too). Some reviewers are more critical of this book, and there are weaknesses. Like most self-help book, too many pages are dithered away convincing us that Simplifying is good (presumably, the reader understands this already.) Also, many of these tips have meaning to those (and there are lots of us) who have been caught up in the yuppy-variety of consermerism (for example, you'll find out here what to do with the towels that no longer match you Color Scheme.)There is something here for everyone, though, and us older readers would like to grind the pages and sprinkle them over the young. And take a tip from St. James: check this book out at the library to keep your shelves clear!"
2,Empty,"For those hoping to simplify their lives, this book may supply the inspiration they need to confirm their commitment. If nothing else, it may be the voice of a kindred spirit, which may be perfect in a time of transition. On the other hand, the content was insubstantial, offering nothing common sense couldn't provide on its own. More disturbing was a quiet misanthropic thread that would pop up, as if getting rid of people would simplify life. For example, a chapter on clutter ends up saying you may need to reconsider keeping the spouse if he treasures clutter and you don't...or you can simplify your life by keeping only two extra sets of dishes, avoiding ""unwanted houseguests"". Both my spouse and my houseguests are treasured, so this sort of advice just made my skin crawl."
2,Not for me,"Sorry, this book lost me 1/4 the way through. First she tells us not to wash our towels every week. What? You've only been changing your towels once a week and now you think that's too often? Then she says to wear our clothing longer without washing them. Well, okay. Until she makes a joke about knowing how to stand upwind from the other person. Losing me a little bit here. Then she tells us not to bother with dusting or vacuuming the house or mowing the lawn. Huh? That's when I closed the book. If drying myself with a stinky towel, dressing in dirty clothing and living in a filthy house with an overgrown lawn is the simple life, it's not for me."
3,Basic,St. James expands on the idea of creating a happier life through simplicity. She teaches readers to change their focus from gaining money to achieving a simpler existence. She fails to address exercise or spirituality.
1,Bla!,Bla! That's exatly what this album is about. Her voice is horrible and her songs are so amateur and full of nothing.
4,Great resource for Southern California,"I have found this book very useful. When we have a free weekend and want to make sure our son has a fun time, we use this book as a guide to planning our day. I like this book so much that I often give it as a babyshower gift."
2,Not really anything impressive,"Maybe I felt this book was inferior because I bought another book with this one that was so fabulous. I just couldn't get into it. The suggestions for ""outings"" were pretty obvious to me and nothing really new. I even thought about passing it along to a friend with a new child but thought she might be offended by it because it really is so basic. Now it sits unused on my shelf, a waste of money and I can't even re-gift it."
5,A unique set of ear warmers,Much more comfortable (though maybe not as warm) as Arctic 180's. These don't dig into your head and overheat your ears. They also stay put very well due to a little flap that you put over your ears. The only downside is they're a little bulky because they don't fold up like the 180's.
1,Not for Cyclists,"Although this product may be suitable for joggers, it is terrible for cyclists. The least bit of air flow around these headphone earmuffs creates incredible background noise. Also, for any type of users, the earpiece covers are very flimsy. They come off constantly and are not very easy to reinstall. Bottom line is that I was so frustrated/disappointed with this product that I threw it away in disgust within just a few weeks of attempted use. The advertising photos showed the product being used by a cyclist... totally inappropriate and misleading."
2,Uncomfortable and Unnecessary,"I'm not impressed: appears to be a ""gimmick item"" developed by an advertising agency. Sound quality is good, but the molded plastic ""behind the neck"" headband is tight, inflexible, and interferes with scarves and hats. My ""over the head"" earphones have large, foam cushions which provide equivalent ear warming without the clumsiness."
1,Timeless wisdom from our Presidents and Leaders,"What a treasure this book is in compiling excerpts from prayers of our American Leaders. The heartfelt pleas of men such as George Washington at Valley Forge, Abraham Lincoln concerning the Civil War and Thomas Jefferson prayer used after the declaration of independence was read on the fourth of July, are contained in this amazing book. The emotional pleas of our leaders for the protection and blessings of Almighty God are timeless. Lest we forget."
5,One of the best,"The Ghost Tower Of Inverness (1979) is, in my opinion, one of the best AD&D; modules of all time. It's for character levels 5-7. I went through it back in 1982. It's a cerebral adventure that places an emphasis on tactfulness and problem solving. The setting is an old magical tower in the Abbor-Alz Hills. In order to enter the tower, players must find a key that consists of four parts. The goal of the adventure is to find the powerful Soul Gem. This is an adventure that gets increasingly difficult as players progress. The tower is dangerous and has many deadly monsters.If you want to go through one of the classic AD&D; modules, then go through this one. Highly recommended."
4,all around great running shoe,"Have been wearing Saucony's pro-grid triumph runners for years and purchased the ""4"" edition months ago. Took about 3 three to five mile runs to break in but now it's just right. On first run shoes felt super cushiony but almost not deep enough to really hold my foot in. Just took some running to get used to them and sink into them, they are great now.Great space in the toe box for me and that awesome cushioning the pro-grid triumphs are known for. As with all the pro-grid triumphs my heel really sits well in the heel cup and I can tie it regularly and not worry about my heel slipping up and down. True to size for me and I'm a 6 1/2 women's regular."
1,fit was awful for me,"I've always worn and loved Sauconys but this shoe was the exception. Just awful! From my first run, I had blister problems on both ankles, even after adjusting the laces. My forefoot on both feet went numb after 2 miles, and I hobbled at the end of my run. I figured that the shoes just needed some breaking in; I came back from my third run with blood all over my ankles from the intense rubbing, and my feet were numb all over. Perhaps if I bought a size larger, this may not have happened, but I think the recommendation should have been included that a buyer needs to buy a size or half size up or that they run small. I have used my old Sauconys since then and need to order another pair, but not this model. In short, very dissapointed!!"
5,AnInteresting Take on Suetonius,"This book is a collection of short biographies along the lines of Suetonius' The 12 Caesars. Allan Massie is better known for his historical fiction but here he puts his research into Roman history in a serious context, and discusses the lives of the first emperors with a purpose to get closer to the truth.He presents the facts and reaches a logical point-of-view. The book is well-written and the information is pragmatic and often conveyed with a dose of humor. Of great importance is that fact that this is not intended to be a retelling of the scandelous lives of the Roman emperors. One may not always agree with Mr. Massie's conclusions but he makes his case. He does not cite any of the ancient histories in his biographies. There is an index but no bibliography."
2,loud!,"I agree! This VCR is very loud, especially when it is rewinding. It makes this loud clicking noise. And even when it's playing it makes the noise, too, just not as loud. I am also returning mine."
4,Get's The Job Done ...,"I use it daily to record. I haven't had any problems with it. Some of the buttons are located in different places. But, that's ok. It works just fine."
2,"Knock, Knock, Who's there?","I was looking for a 4 head hi-fi inexpensive VCR and finally settled on this model. It arrived in 2 days. It set up quite easily. Within minutes, there was an annoying knocking sound coming from the machine. I put several different tapes in the VCR, but the sound persisted. I have returned the VCR. On the plus side, the picture, sound quality and self tracking were good. The remote is not lighted and does not have an eject button."
5,Far exceeded my expectations for $20.00.,"Bought it for the kids since they were always stealing my expensive Sony, well eventually I lost the Sony, and in a moment of despiration grabed the kids, after scraping all of the gooey kid stuff, and replcing the batteries, I ran out the door to go to my meeting. Upon arriving at the meeting I turned on the recorder and to my surprise it worked flawlessly, I think the sound qualty is actually better, and it is definetly durable, upon returning home I bought a new one of these for myself, and have been very happy with it ever sense, the kids still use the old one and it has been a few months now, I just got interviewed with it last week, and it is still ticking."
2,DIDN'T WORK!,We purchased this for office dictation and it did not work well at all. Playback sound was awful and you had to wait a couple of seconds after turning on to start dication after pausing it. Would not recommend this product!
2,disappointed,I will not recommend this item. I am very disappointed with the item. In 2003 someone mentioned about the inaudible sound. It is 2012 and the sound is still the same. It has not improved and so I would not recommend it as stated. There is a better brand which I bought and is very happy with............taylor
1,"Don,t waste your time","Don,t by this. The first one I got didn't work and Recieved another which also didn',t work! Couldn't open for casette and couldn't get to play, after having to buy batteries and tapes."
3,Does the job.,"A device like this is, for all practical purposes, very old technology now so if you're in need of a small recording device it would probably be best to go with a digital voice recorder; they are small, lightweight, inexpensive and cutting edge technology. I simply purchased this Memorex unit because of the need to listen and transcribe a few older micro-cassettes lying about and it does that job just fine. That said, if you have a need to use or transcribe micro-cassettes on an indefinite basis, consider investing more money into a better quality brand and model. This unit's controls are a bit clunky and the buttons a bit small. Having used a lot of this kind of tech growing up, I feel qualified to attest that if tech feels clunky and lower quality, it probably is just that."
1,crap,"it does not work! ive tried everything but buying the wall plugin. it will not do anything, rewind or fast forward, play."
3,Nice Transaction,"The recorder is fine, but NOT the one pictured in the advertisement. No tape counter, which I really needed, and not the same style. but for the price it was ok"
1,should say for ages 2 to5,"Do not buy this..So much hum from recorder can not hear your own voice!! Really bad. I know it did not cost much,and a low end recorder,but wow not good at all. How about no stars!!!"
1,Worthless,"Product doesn't work. Tape supplied barely ran for 1 second when it started to wind through spokes. I put in a different tape and new batteries. Doesn't work for more than 1 second and sometimes doesn't work at all. I tried Energizer, Panasonic, Sunbeam, Walgreen's batteries all with the same result. And I used Olympus, Sony and Maxell microcassette tapes. This is the third tape recorder I've owned so I know how they should work. Sadly I waited too long to try to send it back (because I was so mad) and now it's not worth it for partial credit and I have to pay for shipping. SO NOT worth it! Never again."
1,Selena lives on forever.,"I can't think of a better latina pop star. This cd caputres her best quality,her voice."
5,"Thank you for this album, Abraham Quintanilla!","""Siempre Selena""is my favorite album after ""Amor Prohibido"".Selena`s father has chosen her most beautiful songs to put in it. The best song is ""Soy amiga"", I still can`t believe our queen is not here to sing other hits like that. ""Cien años""is also very good,it is one of her best Mariachi style music. One of the reasons everybody should listen to this album is because of ""Tu robaste mi corazon"", a duet with Pete Astudillo.I think it is her most beautiful ballad, and this version is much better than the original. If you want to buy a treasure, you must buy ""Siempre Selena""."
5,Great CD,"As old as this is, it's still new, refreshing and has the anointing. I would highly recommend this to everyone that wants God and the anointing in your life."
1,Shell fell apart when opened it.,Got here on time. When I opened it I could tell it was cracked and it fell apart when I opened it. Very bad shape.Tommy
2,Neither fish nor fowl,"The author states that this book isn't history and that it isn't fiction, either. I think that for the most part, it's the latter. She admits that there are few written sources for the period, yet at the same time, she goes into great detail on how her subjects felt and what they thought. Obviously, she's using the bare historical record to build a story line. I also think it's really risky to use 20th Century psychological jargon to discuss people who lived in the 14th and 15th Centuries.I am currently reading Robert Knecht's The Valois. If you are looking for historical information on France during the period of the Hundred Years Wars, I think this is a better choice."
3,best of second chapter of acts,although it brought back many memories; it's not the deeply inspiring recording i once thought. a bit of a disappointment.
2,Poor KYB Mounts,"First of all the image displayed of the mount is not correct. This is front mount for maxima and look different. I did get the correct part based on the part number. Bought two of these to replace old nissan oem mounts. The mounts look solid and well made when new. Everything was perfect for about 6 months. The car drove really well, but then I noticed that both mounts had their centers shifted outward by at least 6mm. Needless to say the alignment by then was completely out and the inner tire tread had worn out much more than the outer tread. The mounts completely fell apart in about 10 months. The car was actually only driven about 8k miles in those 10 months. Bottom line... the mounts are poorly built and do not hold up in long run. The original nissan oem mounts lasted over 12 years/130k miles in dry and hot AZ weather. The nissan oem mounts are not that expensive.. go with the oem mounts. The aftermarket KYB are not worth the money/labor involved in putting new mounts."
4,thought provoking book...,"I read this book many years ago, and while I'm not certain that as a 12-year-old I fully grasped it, it was a fun read, and it has stayed with me since. I'm fascinated to seee that this has been the case with others as well. Having read several of Mr. Bonham's urban-set tales beforehand, this bit of action/science-fiction(?) came as a real curveball, though many of his stories are parables. He tells his moral tales so well that, much like an episode of ""Fat Albert"", you don't realize you've been taught a lesson until it's all done. Anyway, every time a another piece of vacant land gets paved over in my beloved (insert your state here), I think about this book and wonder how much closer the future depicted herein is inching."
2,Morally confusing and scary for young kids,"I am sorry but the selection had a lot of strange things that my kid was confused about. The Inheritance had adults fighting and a scary field hand. Okay, for the first one but a little edgy. Lassie's Pups was scary a little for with Jeff taking his bicycle in the night and then getting hurt and being all alone. More stressful but the kid was still a good kid. Then comes The Transition and there is this mysterious psycho little kid who cries all of the time, grandpa is dead and they are at a funeral, little kids fighting, and at the end, the little kid runs away, has to sleep out doors and tries to drown himself in a lake. And then Lassie is given away, totally unlike the first episode where Lassie picks its owner. A horrible collection for little kids younger than 6. Definitely not a group of episodes that were meant to be shown together."
4,Journey to Nostalgia!,"Jeff's Collie, what a journey to 50's America life. Different from the latter ""Timmy Episodes"" this series were so real and so down to earth. Lassie wasn't constantly ""discovering dinamite"" nor ""saving the whole community"" but it was a truly believable intelligent dog that was easy to love. Tommy Rettig did not portray a plastic cute owner like Timmy, (Sorry Timmy fans) but a real 12th year-old fatherless farm boy who filled the gap of his father's absence with the love of his pet. Wonderful series.The DVD mentioned is a great ""starting taste"" but it does not include the best episodes. Who does one contact to vote or put in a word for the release of SEASON BOX SETS of JEFF'S COLLIE? I think these episodes are a part of America's Television History and it would be a terrible loss to let them dissapear."
5,The Best LASSIE,"Jeff's Collie is by far the best collection of Lassie TV available on DVD. I loved this show and used to watch it rerunning on Discovery Kids until some morons decided to take it off the air. Some of the episodes are a bit long in the tooth, yet they are very, very timely as well. Lassie is superior in every way to the current Lassie--hard to say how--he just is. Tommy Rettig and Jan Clayton are excellent as is George Cleveland. Everyone is long dead now, except Porky. This is a real treat and delightful viewing--some of today's kids don't like black and white--they are so used to color, but somehow black and white seems to fit here. Superior."
3,An okay book . . .,"if you really need it. Personally, I thought some of the scenarios were more likely to have occured during the high school years than during college. For instance, the one in which the girl in college becomes jealous of her single mother's time and attention when the mother starts dating. I would expect someone who is considered mature enough to go off to college to be mature enough to handle the fact that mom has a love life. As for the sections devoted to parents who harrass the university faculty/staff on behalf of their kids - surely these folks are aberrations? When she was in HS, I sometimes intervened in situations but over the last three years, my daughter has grown into a mature, poised and intelligent young woman and as such I expect her to handle these things on her own. I would never dream of intervening in an academic situation on her behalf now. It's frankly none of my business."
5,A great book for any parent with kids in college.,As a very protective parent I wanted to read all I could about my daughters up in coming experience at college. I myself never attend college and this book gave me so much insight. I appreciate the author?s candid talk about difficult topics such as alcohol and drugs. I felt at ease after reading it. I recommend this book to everyone I know with kids heading off to college. I also purchased and read Major In Success by Patrick Combs and it was the perfect book for my daughter. Don?t Tell Me What To Do Just Send Money was a great book for me and Major In Success was perfect for my daughter. It gave her all the advice she needed to make the most of her college experience.
2,Give In and Send Money,"The premise of this book seems to be: Your child is a legal adult, so don't tell him/her what to do, just send money. Yes, that's right, I felt that the book seemed to advise doing exactly as the son or daughter would prefer. I had hoped for a guide to ensuring that certain standards are met, in order to justify the flow of money. You know, like decent grades, reasonable plans for finishing on time, no wasting money on luxury purchases while Mom and Dad are sacrificing to pay tuition, etc. Instead, what I found was a guide to feeling OK about giving up those expectations. Not so useful."
4,Great and meaningful music!,"I first was introduced to Karen and her music at a ""Radical Forgiveness"" workshop. This was held in Cincinnati, Ohio and was based on the book ""Radical Forgiveness"" by Colin C. Tipping. Colin facilitated the workshop and Karen provided the music. This was a great experience! If you like music that has a great message this may be the CD for you. Her other collections are excellent as well. Her message is especially good for many of the changes women experience. Highly recommended. (D. Steven Ledingham)Don't know why the tunes are not listed on Amazon, so here they are: (The ""One Mile Apart"" CD)Mama's Song, That's What Love's About, I'll Be There For You, Not, I Am A Woman, If They'd Been There, Hoping To Be Loved By You, Try To Remember, Say No More, One Mile Apart, How Can I Help You Say Goodbye"
2,"It's Boring,It's boring","I didn't like this book much at all but I understand others might.The 2 authors have used a different style of writing without quotations,but it didn't work for me.Very boring.In short it is about a girl whose identical twin sister is killed.And how she copes..or tries to cope...with that reality."
5,Love 'Em!,They are fantabulous! Extremely confortable and last quite a long while if taken care of! Both cute and sexy! ;)
3,it was much too technical,"there was way to much detail, and they needed to just get on with the video, but it was o.k."
2,Not for tomatoes or beans...,"These stakes are very thin and not tall enough once they are placed in the ground. If you're considering their use for tomatoes or a robust veining plant ""STOP"" and look for something better suited for the project. These stakes may be ok for some very small plant needing limited support."
3,Gopher/mole removal,I purchased this item for my sister-in-law who is plagued by moles/gophers in her garden nursery; she had been told that chocolate Ex-Lax was a great remedy for getting rid of the pests. I'm not sure as to how it worked.
2,"Installation was a learning experience, and it didn't work.","If you have never taken the tank off a bike with EFI you need to know that the fuel system is always pressured up. So prepare ahead of time for how you are going to clamp off fuel lines,Intalled the unit then put the bike back together turned on the key to test the unit and instead of all the lights coming on briefly then going off they all three stayed on. Long story short took everything back off the bike checked all the connections and still had the same results. Went through the process two more times with the same results. Contacted Cobra explained all that I had done, and they provided me with an RMA number to return it to them for inspection and testing. Still waiting to get it back or a new unit.Not sure if it was worth all the trouble."
3,Dicey CA State Board Book,"Maciocia's work has been quite influential in the U.S. despite the fact that some of his information is from the classics, while other parts are his own creation. He does not always differentiate between the two, nor does he always cite his sources.For example, the idea that the outer back shu points are effective for the treatment of emotions... not from the Classic sources, according to Philippe Sionneau. So where did it come from? Who made it up?However, we still have to know everything in his books for the CA state board. His zang-fu herbalized-style point functions, 5 phase type, three jiao patterns, etc. are unique to this book.In its defense, it does have a lot of important basic info, and it's written by a native English speaker... but it's a vastly different look at Chinese Medicine from say The Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medicine by Nigel Wiseman.Good start for the new student... but neither the last word, nor infallible."
1,Adequate,"Gives an adequate overview of the basic concepts in chinese medicine, but is sorely lacking in many, many others. What it lacks, as does much of the information originating from communist China, are the Taoist roots of the medicine which have a very tangible impact on its practice (especially the psychospiritual elements) - something that is sorely lacking from the modern TCM iteration of Chinese medicine. Its understanding of the production of Qi and Xue is incomplete, which limits its usefulness clinically as well. Much more information from the classics should be included in this text to warrent its name as a 'foundational' text."
5,THE BEST ACUPUNCTURE TEXTBOOK AVALIABLE,"This is truly one of the best texbooks I have every seen that explains acupuncture and chinese medical theory. Very comprehensive and informative. It begins by explaining foundational principles of chinese medical thought such as: yin and yang, the five elements, vital substances, the trasformation of Qi, the function of the different organ systems and patterns, and concludes with very descriptive information on the action and use for most points. This text is used at many acupuncture colleges around the nation. A MUST HAVE for all who have a sincere interest in chinese medicine. Keep an eye open for Giovanni's next work ""Diagnosis IN Chinese Medicine""."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I knew when I saw the price, that this was going to be useless software, but the write-up made it sound complete. This ONLY has the ability to track employee information, it has NO tax tables or anything else required to process your payroll. Don't waste your money on this!!"
5,Superbly Done A&E Biography!!,"This is a superbly done A&E Biography of our former US President Ronald Reagan who is now in his 90's and currently suffering from Alzheimers disease, which hopefully will someday be a cure for.Ron,we all love you!!You were a great President!!"
3,Super charged,"I looked at reviews for supplements for quite some time and this one came up number one on a few websites. I'd never heard of Labrada supplements but I figured I'd give it a test. The directions say 1 scoop for intense workout, or 2 scoops for super intense workout. (Make sure you DO NOT take this before running however, you will regret it.) Personally it seemed to do it's job for a while but than I'd start to feel sick or light headed halfway through my workout sometimes. I can't say for sure if this was the main cause of it but I really didn't get that big pump of energy I was expecting. All it really did was keep me wide awake every night. Flavor and Ingredients get 5 stars though."
5,Great Stuff!,"This is one of the greatset products to hit the market. It does what promises to do. Anyone who needs an extra ""umph"" in their workut will benefit."
5,Highly Recommend!,"I started using Super Charge about 2 months ago after a friend recommended it. Super Charge has really helped with increased energy, strength and gives me a nice workout ""pump."" I use one scoop about 30 min before each workout. I do not get any side effects I had with other products like headaches, stomach aches to name a few. Really satisfied with SuperCharge, I'd give it 10/10."
2,Save the greenbacks!!,"Its simply not worth the money. I have been trying NOX products for some time now and find that most of them are a waste of money. Im 38 years old and a gym veteran at this point in very good shape and believe me. nothing substitutes for simple food. I try these products to 'boost' my moodin the morning workouts. Wether or not i am getting vital nutrients to my muscles faster with these products or not, ill continue with simple creatine and anti catabolic supps like Xtend. Sorry Labrada two thumbs down for this one."
3,Texas Teamwork,"I have read the book, but I did not enjoy it as much as some of the other J. T. Edson books I own. For some reason I prefer the Floating Outfit books the best. I will continue to purchase J. T. Edson books."
1,The worst band ever makes the worst album,I can't believe all these people here give them good reviews because all pepper does is blatantly rip-off other peoples music. They steal other peoples music and don't give them recognition. They don't have much talent so i guess thats why they do it but its just sad.
5,Add Some Pepper to Your Music Library,"There is a good quote I read about this band one time...""While some bands do ska better, no band does it more fun than Pepper."" ""Use Me"" might be one of my favorite songs of all time, but it is not just one song that makes this album. It's the fact that you can use the term album in describing it. The word album is the proper description as it is cohesive and fun to listen to the whole way through. Outsid eof Kona Town, this is probably my favorite album of their's."
4,"A little weaker, but still Solid","Okay let me start it like this, peppers first album Give'n IT is the best album they have by far. Give'n It was solid and beautiful it was just rereleased buy it. Kona Town was also a good album but you could see they are beginning to change a little. When I heard the guy from 311 was producing this album I sai oh s**t there goes Pepper's sound. But I must say at first I did not like the album they lost most of their unique sound, their idenity almost. Most people compare them to all the other South Cali bands but they are from Hawaii and now reside in Cali I don't think you can compare them. Sure its reggea but I think they have a uniqueness to it, buy Give'n IT its the best one but this one was not so bad. See them live they kill it."
2,Not Pepper's Best...,"Believe me, I really want to like Pepper. I am from the Big Island and I want to support local bands. I love Sublime-style reggae. All reggae, actually. But despite this I still found In With The Old to be disappointing. On the plus side, the vocals are strong and some of the songs are catchy. Unfortunately this is overshadowed by juvenille (and often meaningless) lyrics, too many muscially bland 2-chord chorus' (as heard in songs such as Are You Down) and lastly, some of the country influenced songs on this album will make you reach for the ""track forward"" button on your CD player. I can see this album being played at high school parties. I have already graduated in terms of school as well as musical taste so it is not for me. I continue to have high hopes for Pepper's next release but this album just didn't do it for me."
3,JamZ,"The album is decent. I enjoyed listening to it but Pepper's other albums are alot better in my opinion. The music has definately changed a bit but if it didn't I guess it wouldn't be a new album. People like Vincent P. Pallares are gay and shouldn't be able to write reviews. His favorite band is Creed so that pretty much narrows his judgement down. Statements like the band steals other peoples material is retarded especially when he doesn't back it up and explain who they are stealing from. We'll who was it? A gay ass 80's band that you were listening to back in the day while you and you're friends sucked each others cocks off? LOL! Anyways, get this album and Pepper's other albums if you enjoy rock/reagae, stuff like Sublime ect."
3,sublime rip off,this band does have good music but the problem is sublime already did it. the singer can during some songs have an original voice and even their music can be a little original but for the most part the guy tries way to hard to sound slike sublime. i give only gave this three stars because they do a better job imitating sublime than the left overs of sublime did with long beach dub allstars
3,It works,"could have been this particular items from this particular seller, it is troublesome and im sorting that but this device is a bit slow."
5,tug of war,i like this album. i think its kind of a 'where do we go from here' album. it has all the elements of an amalgamated earlier milemarker yet more intense emphasis on computer and keys. they do have this habit of reconstructing or deconstructing early songs. it goes both ways for me
3,Cassette tape player,"I had trouble getting it to work at the beginning but I smacked it a few times the first few days and now it works fine!!! If I were buying it again, I would buy a more expensive item that had an eject button. I like the strap."
1,poor performer,unit is easy to use but very poor quality recording; tape wavers and sound is distorted; seller refunded purchase price;
3,Cassette,"The recorded voice is not really clear, but for the price it is certainly adequate for my purposes. my purposes"
3,This thing is okay.,"This little thing is okay for light note taking (with external mike) & such. Not very good for playing music, or cassettes recorded on other machines. But, hey, for $15! Worth it!"
1,Thank Good It's Out of Print,"I don't usually write bad review for books. But this grinding book by Grinder is miserable. The English is poor, and the book does not carry any substance. Poetry is meant to be enjoyed, and not to space people out. Use an editor next time."
2,3 strikes it's OUT!!!,It worked three times and died. Would Have gotten 5 stars had it not died. This company makes products that die right out of the box. Other reviews of their other items by customers are sooo true. Should Have Listened.
3,Nice while it lasted,"I bought this and after about four months it stopped working. It worked really well up until then. I was worried about the nubbie things on the shaft, but if you use a condom with your toys it's hardly noticable."
2,Not very comfortable...,"I bought this one a couple years back and it's honestly the least used toy I have. I've only used it a couple of times. I hate the spike things all over it, can't stand it without a TON of lube, and the rotation feature was nowhere near as impressive as I thought it would be. The vibrations are weak and it is hard to get it to hit my clit right. I have several other toys that I like *much* better. Someday, I'll have the heart to just throw it away. Honestly, even a couple years later I cringe to think of the money I spent on it. There is only one merit to this toy... It looks interesting enough to make a conversation piece."
4,A great tribute to my favorite movie star,"I was more than delighted when I was finally able to watch the biography of Paul Newman. I have been a fan for only a few months but I have seen a great number of his films and was becoming curious about his life as well. This documentary does a wonderful job of tying together his personal life and the different stages of his career. The biography explores not only Newman's acting career, but also his experiences in car racing and in philanthropy. I have already seen it twice and will watch it again very soon. I only wish it had been longer!"
1,great disappointment.,"Sometimes the artwork of a cd foreshadows a fantastic musical journey awaiting the listener. Unfortunately, Les Ondes Silencieuses is not the case. The artwork by iker spozio is sublime to say the least, one of the best cd covers I've seen in a while. It suggests a dreamy landscape full of nocturnal visions. The music, however, is a disastrous mess. Minimalism is beautiful when the it is inspired. Experimental music is fascinating when it is inspired. But Colleen was far from inspired here. She grabbed instruments she did not play well and tried to create a collection of pieces that suffer from a lack of musical skills. The cello and harpsichord tracks especially are painful to listen to. The album is at its best when she plays the guitar and the clarinet. But nevertheless, it is a big let down. I might be totally wrong. Give it a try and see if you like it. I recommend her two previous albums: Everyone Alive Wants Answers, and The Golden Morning Breaks."
4,Oswald Fact or Fiction?,"This non-conspiratorial interpretation of the infamous Lee Harvey Oswald is absolutely refreshing and fascinating. What A & E Biography does is attempt to build a psychological profile of Oswald that would explain his actions that place him in a snipers nest on the 6th floor of the Texas Book Depository during that fateful day. If you are one of those devout believers in the JFK conspiracy, I invite you to view this video and perhaps the years of myth and fairy-tales that have been told to you will be put in doubt."
2,Poor quality sound,"I find the quality of the recordings to be very poor. I can hardly understand what's being said, and there is a lot of noise in the recordings, even in the SP mode. About the only thing it's good for is if you are one of those ghost hunters who record the voices of ghosts. You'll get plenty with this unit. If you're going down to this price level, you might as well just go back to tape."
5,Great book for elementary students,"I bought this for my son so he could do his school report on the State of Louisiana. It's a perfect book for this. Nicely written, nice photographs, plenty of detail for the level he needed."
4,An excellent book on power and diplomacy,"Christian Reus-Smit has been writing well on issues to do with international relations for a while, but this is easily his most accesible book to date and the one most likely to make an impact on foreign policy studies.The general informed reader will enjoy this book and come away with some important thoughts regarding contemporary international politics - you don't need to be a foreign policy wonk to get a lot out of this book.This is one that is sure to become quite influential and to receive many citations in journal articles and books to come for many years."
4,Great Gift,This hitch cove is a fantastic gift item for the sports fan that has everything. My father really loved it!
2,Wrong Information in description,"The hitch cover came, and looks great. It is as it looks in the picture, and is not a helmet as in title. BUT it doesn NOT fit 1.25"" hitch. It says it does, but it only fits 2"" hitches. Annoying, since this is the second hitch I've bought from Amazon that was mislabled in the description."
5,Michigan Hitch Cover,"So far, this is a great purchase! I am very happy. I have had this now for nearly two years and I have no rust. I will say it did not fit ""snugly"" into my receptor hitch, but I used some of the packing material and thus far, no rattling has occurred. I would definitely buy another product made by this company. Shipping was good. I also had no problems with the packaging."
2,NOT As Advertised,"This is NOT a fleece as the title and product description say. It is made out of the same sweatshirt material as a medium weight hoody. Also, the decal was off-center and positioned in such a way as to prevent the zipper from functioning. The rubber material the decal was made of was right on top of the zipper and I had to remove parts of it with an Xacto blade before giving it to my boyfriend as a gift.The reason for two stars rather than one is that it is still a nice sweatshirt and my boyfriend really liked it. For the price though, it should be exactly as advertised and the quality should have been better."
4,What an Odd Title!,"The common denominator of all these stories is that (surprise!) a birthday is celebrated. Two of the stories are from the Jeff era, the 1950's tale ""Gramps' Birthday"" and ""Party Line,"" which is about the entire town of Calverton not knowing it's the birthday of Jenny the town telephone operator. The third episode is from 1971, in the Holden ranch sequence of episodes: the new foster son of Garth Holden has been so neglected he doesn't even know his birthday. Of course the Holdens do something about that immediately."
4,Fun Single,"This is the single featuring the 1999 version of ""Pop Singer's Fear of the Pollen Count,"" which can also be found on ""A Secret History,"" the ""best of"" album put out the same year. I am giving four stars instead of five because I prefer the version of the song found on ""Liberation,"" though this version is fun. The highlight of this release for me was actually the Magnetic Fields cover, ""With Whom to Dance."" Neil Hannon sounds amazing (as he usually does, but he sounds especially amazing here). There is also an acoustic version of ""Eric the Gardener,"" which is a song that has grown on me quite a bit. If you're a big fan of The Divine Comedy/Neil Hannon, you'll probably enjoy this CD, as I have. It might also be a good, albeit small, sampler for a new fan, though I'd recommend ""A Secret History"" first."
3,For the Educated Traveler,"This video is one of the ""Super Cities"" series produced by the International Video Network, which consists of one-half hour tapes of 22 of the more interesting cities in the world. They are, far and away, the best travel videos that I have seen.The approach that the producers take is to mix aerial and ground footage in roughly 50/50 proportions. This approach is especially effective for Istanbul, which has large-scale buildings and the Bosporus running through it.Ideally, view this video first and then read a good guide book (the best that I've found is Istanbul (Eyewitness Travel Guides). The video will provide an overview of the city, while the book will fill in the details. Together they'll convince you that you have to visit this wonderful crossroads of East and West.NOTE: There appear to be two versions of this film, one good (the VHS version, produced in 1994) and one not-so-good, which appears to be this version. Thus, 3 stars."
3,"Good in daylight, almost unusable in dim light","The red lettering poses no problem in daylight, but is almost invisible in dim light (keys on my laptop are black; red lettering may be better with silver keys since characters are darker in reality than on the photo).. No such problem on the other laptop for which I bought yellow lettering stickers."
5,Very funny!,"If you enjoy zany, off the wall, non-stop hillarity, then purchase this video! Yes I did say video, unfortunately this special never made it to DVD. Still worth what you will pay for it!"
4,Found,"So many times we wonder, 'if I could do it - the results would be'. Mrs. Lora Leigh Moore, I am sure you have 'hit' on many a dream-come-true; even if the ending is a little too real - everything is roses and one falls down.Probably, the quickest novel I have ever read: it is very close to my own story; my real life story - 'if I could do it - the results would be'."
2,Nothing Groundbreaking,"This book is a moderately interesting read for someone trying to keep up to speed on current bible dialog. However, to contend that the idea of a common source for the gospels of Matthew and Luke is revolutionary is extremely naive.I had classes in both Catholic high school and a Catholic University (70s & 80s) that included study of the Bible . Several things routinely taught are now portrayed as shocking and ""shaking the foundations of Christianity."" It is commonly understood that Matthew and Luke borrowed from Mark and some other common source. This other source was even referred to as ""Q"". We were also taught that the letters of Paul (or some of them) were likely not written by Paul - shocking.What the author of this book does is take this concept of a common source for the Gospels and build it into something much more concrete that can not (and is not) substantiated."
4,A touchy subject,"This is a touchy subject - very touchy. I mean, Christians are still around, and they can get edgy about books like this. But in my opinion, Mack goes to the other extreme. He is known for his slightly radical attitude to Christianity. And this shows through in this book.""The Lost Gospel"" is a good read. It is a fine attempt to bring scholarly work on Q to a wider audience. But sadly, as others have said on this site, he is too conclusive in his attitude. Most of the things he says here are exceedingly controversial. Now I am not a Christian; but I can imagine Christians being a little annoyed by this. For a fuller view of the nature of the controversey...I am afraid the average reader needs to read further. If only the situation was really as simply as Mack claims! Then our job would be easier.But please, don't simply reject books like this out of religious faith. Not an anti-christian conspiracy; just historians doin' their thing with a very, very touchy topic!!! ;)"
1,Only for the most curious...an with a dose of NoDoze,"Professor Mack posits the existence of an anterior ""book"" to the Synoptic Gospels, ""the Book of Q,"" yet he can support this supposition only through deducing such a creature through his own predisposed notions about what such a ""book"" SHOULD have been, and in tune with his own idea of a classless, pre-socialist fraternity, in which Jesus becomes a social revolutionary, a glorified teacher, but little else. If this is all there is to Christianity, then give me unadulterated Marxism or Fascism any day. Poorly argued, and obtusely expressed, to boot."
2,Blind leading the Blind,"A classic case of ""Blind leading the Blind"".This book has some interesting Jew/Roman history at the time of Jesus. But professor Mack in this book builds his theory of ""Christianity as a myth/ Four gospels lied about Jesus"" on a ficitional gospel ""Q""; Mack then used the ficitional ""Q"" to prove (the historical) four gospels in the New Testament are all ""ficitional accounts about Jesus as Christ"". His theory is built on shaky foundation."
5,Doc,Well worth the money. Adjustable speed. Nice touch. etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc
1,Great while it lasted,"I liked this product until it became less intense and inconsistent. I just thought the batteries were dying, so I changed them and it was still iffy. I don't know if I got a lemon or if this is just garbage but I wouldn't purchase again."
2,Yippy,Ok its not the best thing but it works I wouldnt say get it either its kind of uncomfortable its ok I just dont think its even worth 10 bucks really its plastic shoot it needs to be softer. I wouldnt buy another one for sure.
1,Defective,"turned this on for maybe 10 minutes and it broke, tried installing different batteries to no avail. pretty disappointed because it's not like this is a product you can return. don't bother, spend the extra money and invest in a better quality toy."
3,Not as good as most Doc Johnson models,"I tried a couple of these but find them to be underpowered. Most Doc Johnson units that I have tried had more power. I like and buy Doc Johnson units, just don't care that much for this one. If you like a little less power, you will probably like this one. I prefer their Silver Bullet model."
2,"The product was not what I exspected, sorry","The product was well made and I received it in a timely manner, but it was not what I exspected."
2,A LITTLE DISAPPONTING,"A little weak in power for the job intended. Haven't used it enough yet to know about battery life, but vigor of vibration leave a lot to be desired."
4,CHICKEN soup?,"While this book is wonderful, has anyone noticed the inconsistency in calling a book for animal lovers ""chicken soup""? How can we claim to love animals but think that eating them (in the form of soup or anything else) is okay? I would have given this book a higher rating if not for this glaring inconsistency."
1,No nostalgia here...save your money.,"When I happened to find this book, I was instantly swept back to the 1960s: Rocky & Bullwinkle, Edward Everett Horton, Aesop, etc. I hoped this book would continue that pleasant nostalgic feeling.Instead, Jacobs' book took me on a boring, fractured, intolerable ride. The only similarities between what Jay Ward did back then and what Jacobs has published are the artwork (which is minimal) and a few story titles.Jacobs is neither clever, witty, nor original. All he has done is to introduce some fractured 1990s' buzzwords (for example, Beverly Hills 90210) into these charming classics.Don't waste your money...watch the reruns on The Cartoon Network instead."
3,Old Favorites,"It was a joy to read the fairy tales I remember watching on TV with my children when they were very young. The best ones were at the beginning. The ones toward the end weren't as cute, which made it tougher to finish the book - although I read it at one sitting. I will loan this book out instead of suggesting someone else spend their money on it."
3,Great smell. But made my hair dry by comparison.,"I'm new to hair tonics. I shower at night so I wanted something that I could put into my hair and scalp so my hair wouldn't be dry and hard to manage in the morning. I purchased Eau De Portugal and Vitalis and gave them both a try (two days with Vitalis and two days with Pinaud). The Eau De Portugal definitely smelled better and has a little more of a fresh ""tingle"" on the scalp when I applied it to damp hair after a shower. However, once it was dry, so too was my hair. It felt even more dry than when I shampooed and did nothing. The Vitalis, on the other hand, made my hair feel softer and more manageable to style in the morning. So, I've been sticking with the Vitalis (to clarify I only use it as a post-shower tonic, not to style and hold). I'll keep the Eau De Portugal in my bathroom cabinet to perhaps re-evaluate at another time."
3,"Good works, OK book","Kuma always seek to experiment w/ new materails, and the subsequent construction and detailing in his projects are quite unusual and interesting. The formulation of new material and its tectonic, unlike that of Herzog & de Meuron, has systematically addressed the issues of 'Transparency' and 'Dematerialization', in a clearly Japanese fashion, and I can't help but recall Mies's (unfinished) pursuit of same concept, although the latter eventually became reconciled by resolution of structural system, which is almost philosophical, a polar opposite to the 'phenomenal' Barcelona Pavilion project.Anyway, enough of arch history sentiment . I'm kinda disppointed in the editing of this book. Instead of focusing on the best ones, this book assigns about same numbers of pages to every work, including the mundane, mediocre one. [...]."
5,Good Resource,"A great design resource for the price: large high quality photos, nicely keyed plan/section/elevation for every project, great graphic layout. To be honest, I haven't read a word of the text, but the photos and drawings are worth the purchase price. Of course Kuma's work is excellent - if you like 'screens' this is the book for you.."
5,The help when you need it1,"Along with other information on the Process of writing Essays, this will aid in being more concise for the modern writer."
4,Good deal,I love the divider its alittle smaller then I thought and a lil unstrudy at times. Other then that it is great. I use it for some photoshoots when shooting models. With it and the lighting it looks great.
2,Not a history lover? This is probably not for you,"I love history and the Lincoln Assassination is a particular favorite of mine. I like to read bios and watch documentaries about all of the conspirators. I am also always on the lookout for videos to show in my high school social studies class so I wanted to check out Biography's look at JWB. Although it was easy for me to follow, I was disappointed overall. The pace of the video is too slow and the background music is overemphasized. If you like history, you might like this video, but will come away with an empty feeling. I am hoping the the good people at Biography will redo the Bio of JWB. He is an important figure in American History and worth knowing about."
2,so-so production,"very lackluster production that closed with the line that booth was killed in maryland. duh! booth was killed in virginia.........anywaythe same photographs are shown over and over and over, although some of the photographs were ones i had not seen. i will watch it again, and i will keep it as part of my collection, but i wouldnt recommend it to the serious student."
4,Interesting,It was good but it could have been betterin my opion they should have talked more about Booth's plan to decapitate the govrnment by not only killing Lincoln but 2 of his cabinet members not enough information was given about that.all in all i liked it.
2,"Boring, Repetitive & Lacks Visual Stimulation.",I had to get this book for a class. This has got to be on my Top 5 list of boring textbooks with a lot of unnecessary filler in every paragraph. The concepts are repetitive and so are the explainations. A definition will be described and then the author spends an entire paragraph rephrasing the definition. This was a poor choice for my professor to choose.I feel it also lacks visual stimulation and interest because it is printed in black and white and practically on newsprint paper. Charts and diagrams would be more interesting if they were color coded.
2,What was really this movie about???,"I won't repeat here the same things that other reviewers have said, as I totally agree with them.This movie has several boring parts, and the main character (Emmanuelle) is wasted all way long.Everybody watching this movie could expect more real action with Emmanuelle, but she only plays some nude shots, and that's all. Disappointing!The worse of this film, is its ending. When you see Emmanuelle fingering on the bare dirt, you would expect her to remember the last part of her journey, but then the credits start to roll!! So, you wonder, what really happened to her in the jungle?? What is this movie about? What kind of ending is that??All the movie is about Emmanuelle remembering her (forgotten) traumatic experience in the Amazon jungle. But it seems you'll miss the best part since she doesn't finish recalling her memories, so this movie is a monumental fraud.What really happened to Emmanuelle in the jungle? We'll never know... this really sucks!"
3,Emmanuelle 6,"It was Ok, But I do like the Sylvia Kistal Version myself, the first Emmanuelle is what started it, beautiful photography, well good story, and also the music. This version is more like a Emmanuelle Wanta Be. Yes she does have a beautiful body, but the story just lost it. If you want to see the Original Emmmanuelle 1, and 2, and 3 with Sylvia Kistal, I would say those are the best in the series.."
3,Definitely one of the best of the Emmanuele series.,"Excellent music and beautiful photography, plus some surprisingly erotic camera work."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR THIS GENERATION,"I have bought this book for myself, and for family members and friends. This is a MASTERPIECE in today's literary works. It really is a solution to determine one's own worth in today's society. Those who are questioning this book's validity - must be in question of their own worth. It is very worthwhile to delve into, and learn from. God Bless those with eyes to see and ears to hear. Morality is really crucial for us all. Mr. Springer has done an EXCELLENT JOB with this book."
1,Judge a Book by its Cover,"Ignore what you're elementary school teachers told you, and for once in your life, judge a book by its cover. The author. Standing in front of a river. Holding a sword. Are you really going to trust Ronald E. Springer to provide you with Moral Armor? I haven't even read this crappy book, but am disgusted by his self advertisement on amazon through various reviews and lists. He describes his own book as the ""non-fictional equivalent of Atlas Shrugged."" There you go: two pieces of crap worthy of each other."
5,The Best Horror Movies,"These Are The Best Horror Movies Especially On DVD with all of the special features you will need on DVD. If You Haven't Seen The Third One Yet. You Should, You Will Love It. These Movie Have Got A Lotta Violence, Gore, Language, and Horror Spoofing,This Movies are so good and the best movies from the horror category."
3,Decent,"*As with all my DVD review I do not review the content of the movie, yet the quality of the DVD*The Scream Boxed Set comes in an attractive package from Dimension and is a steal ... . Each film has its own DVD, with an extra bonus disc thrown in the mix. While the picture and sound transfers are excellent, there are some notable problems. The Dual Layer switch in Scream 2 is so distracting I wondered if it was a skip in the disc. Also the sound is very loud and basserific, (especially in Scream 3) which kinda scared my cat. It's not a problem, but somewhat annoying. The most annnoying feature is that you cannot switch from the commentary to regular audio using the AUDIO button on any of the discs. The commentary tracks are excellent, yet hidden away in the Bonus Features menu selection. The menu design on discs 2 and 3 is very clunky. But the features are stellar, especially the plethora of outtakes on Scream 2. All in all it's a worthy buy if you're a fan like me.._cameron_"
5,GREAT MOVIES!,"I love scary movies, and movies with suspense! All three of these are really really good! They keep you on the edge of your seat!"
5,i love it,im glad that they had the movies on dvd and they came in good condition and i love it a lot
1,HD Transfer Sucks,Ok i bought this set just for the fact that scream was on blu ray and would love to see the new transfer....well no new transfer here this blu ray actually doesnt even look like a blu ray it looks like dvd quailty and you can see grain and scratches throughout all 3 films :( to me its a waste of blu ray space. older films look way better than these 3 scream movies do its sad that they would not treat these movies with the respect that they deserve. as for the new docs on here they look better than the films themselfs so that was a plus but all in all watching scream on blu ray is like watching a dvd in your blu ray player.
3,The 1st one is awesome but the rest kind of suck,"1: Good, i still think that there is too many characters and i hated it when Jamie Kennedy died (just because Jamie kennedy is really cool and if he was in 2 and 3...i would buy the box set). Anyways, Not scary at all but pretty damn cool. A bunch of hot chicks...how can you argue with that.2: Gay3: Lame"
1,These won't make you scream....,"Rich pretty teens get killed, main stream fluff for the ""kids"". Best part of all three films is the first ten minutes of the first feature, but only in the directors-cut (not in this set)when Drew's boyfriend gets disembowled, and his guts spill out, also the zoom-in on Drews body hanging from the tree is not as rushed (thanks MPAA!)"
1,Toilet Paper For Horror Fans,Zero stars for being worth Zero of my time. Downfall of Wes Craven. This is toilet paper for true horror fans.
1,This isn't horror.......,"Models, and beauty queens getting killed off by a guy in a mask, and they've made three of them? Yes, the first one was ok.. But they made two more?!! Come on! Wake up, and smell the coffee people.Pick up an alien Alien movie, the good old fashioned WThe FogW,Predatorwhy not Poltergeist 1, or 2?Or the ultra unfriendly ""Revenge of the Demon.""Anything that takes you away from this rubbish gets my blessing"
1,Should have stopped at the last one........,"I was so excited to have a long awaited follow-up to the Scream Trilogy, until i watched it last night. What was Wes Craven thinking? .....or was he. I did enjoy some of the end of the movie, however, having to watch the entirety of the movie left me wondering what went wrong with the writing? I can usually just kick back, relax, wait for a scare to make me jump, but not in this one, left nothing to get a good scare over, at least not for me, maybe others have a different take. As for me, i wouldn't waste my money if i had to do it over again....."
1,SAD movies...SAD,All I can say is...If you pay 60 bucks for these stupid movies you might as well lock yourself in your bedroom and cry.
5,The Ultimate Trilogy Set,"I got this movie set for Christmas from my aunt and just love this DVD box set of Scream. This is a perfect trilogy set of Scream for any horror fan. You get this nice box set that has all of the movies of Scream and also a bonus DVD that has exclusive bonus features that you can't get any where else but on this box set of Scream. Also, if you have a computer that has a DVD-ROM, you can also access even more bonus features. I recommend this Scream box set to any fan that loves horror movies or just wants to watch all the Scream they can get. Excellent movie and perfect box set."
4,Screamarrific.....,"Very cool box set for any horror fan and a no-brainer for any ""Scream"" fan. Defintely worth the money. It has the gore,the violence, the comedy, and keeps you guessing to the end. Great behind the scenes stuff plus a few extras for any fan. My only bad mark with this is the widescreen format. It takes away too much of the screen. Why?????"
5,Now I can keep all 3 in a box,"No, the box isn't important, but all three movies were very good. The 1st is by far one of my all time favorite movies. It is in a 9 way tie between...Dante's PeakT2T3Die HardDie Another DayTwisterVertical LimitPanic RoomThe other two films were great, especially the 3rd. The very last line was one I will never forget...""You'll have to see for yourself"" and the part after that made me agree that this was onee of the greatest trilogies ever, not because it was a horror trilogy, but because of that last scene in the last movie tightens all the loose knots."
3,a good trilogy,"Okay here's what I think about the Scream TrilogyScream - good with okay actors, little cheesy and not very scary and the ending is very good.Scream 2 - very good with better actors and a LOT more blood and gore. The ending is okay.Scream 3 - funny but I really hope this is the last. the ending is good but I wonder if this really is the end."
2,Horror Movie Satire,"I don't find these movies to be scary. I wouldn't even consider them slashers. They are more funny than scary. Its like an episode of scooby doo where every one is suspicious and the gang is tring to figure out who it is. Also the motivation for the murders in these movies are so lame. And at the end they always explain why they did it like in scooby doo. Though not as bad as Blair witch, the series comes pretty close. There bad acting and stale plots earns this series a **/***** star rating. For those who can't find a good horror movie try these:Videodrome, Bad taste, Deep red, suspiria, Hellraiser, Don't look now, Rosemary's baby, Texas Chainsaw massacre(1974), Exorcist, The beyond, Dead Ringers, Evil Dead, The omen, Psycho, Black Christmas and If none of these work for you, I don't think horror is the genre for you"
5,SCREAM RULES,"The entire scream trilogy rules. This is going to be the best dvd collection of all time. There is no trilogy of movies that is perfect. This is the first and finally buena vista is giving it the dvds it deserves. The Scream 2 dvd, which originally only had a theatrical trailer, will now be complete with deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, tv spots, trailer, music videos, and an audio commentary by Wes Craven, Marriane Maddelena, and Patrick Lussier."
5,A decent price for the series,"I'm not a big Scream fan, but the price is reasonable for those who bought into this. I'll take my Friday the 13th anyday.Scream - This movie has become so cliched and is the butt of so many parodies and jokes, that watching it just isn't enjoyable anymore. Still, it's nice to see Drew Barrymore sliced, diced, and hanging from a treeScream 2- I liked this one better than the original. Favorite scene is the death of Sarah Michelle Geller. Looks like nose in the air Buffy ain't so tough after all.Scream 3- Stupid. Mom was an actress? Long lost brother? I think they got this idea from the novel that claims to solve the Lizzie Borden case using the illegitimate brother angle?Worst complaint about these movies? Gale Weathers...Scream 1 - Hot!Scream 2 - Hot!Scream 3 - Gnarly! She looks like a skeleton. I couldn't even recognize her. Yuck."
5,"Overrated, Overhyped And Not Very Scary!!!","For those of you who like ""Slasher Movies' instead of true Horror the Scream Trilogy is now available in a boxed set.These would have to be three of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The movies consist of a guy running around in a black outfit wearing a stupid mask and carrying a knife killing young teenagers. Perhaps he wanted to be Batman or Dracula in real life which is why he is always dressed in black.These three movies all make THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE in Horror movies which is you don't care about any of the characters so their fate is irrelevant.I didn't even care when one of the teenagers was making a somewhat sophisticated speech about surviving in Horror movies. It is a pity that he didn't say you also have to be less annoying and more likeable. I give these movies 5 stars because once again Wes Craven has taken a good concept for a movie but failed in it's execution (no pun intended) onscreen."
3,SCREAM,"Scream in my opinion is one of the most original horror movies of our time. It's cleverness and its edge of your seet moments was what made scream get all its fans. Scream one, two, and three in essence are one movie since they are all part of a trilogy that connects them. It's humor, which some did not catch, involved making fun of itself and of most other horror movies. The way horror movies repeat themself. The way they all have that good looking girl that of course as we all know will die and then does. Then the main character of the movie of course no matter how many times attacked can't die and won't die. Then the rules of a horror movie which are about a exact science. While poking fun at itself, deriving original freaky ideas, and making your mind twist over who that killer is, scream is a fun scary movie that will take you for the ride of your life."
4,A Scream Fest,"I love these films, well 1 and 2 anyway, like part 3 too but not as much. What I like about the films is that each one has a bit of it's own style. Part one pokes fun at horror movies while being one as well. Part 2 which has never gotten the respect it deserves is a very good sequel while making fun of them. Part 3 doesn't work as well, sure it's fun and often even funny but other than that it's basically what the first makes fun of. The 2nd is actually my favorite though, it's suspenseful, sexy and full of funny remarks.The cast in these films have never had more memorable characters. David Arquette especially, he's so good as Dewey that it's a damn shame that he had to take this annoying wacky turn. Well anyway check out these films, they're perfect for a friday night."
4,"No new DVD features, collector's book and extra DVD","Because you already know what the movie Scream has to offer, because you are looking into this boxed set. I will tell you what the boxed set has to offer. The set is rather simple nothing too special is done for the boxed set, no special DVD packaging, just a simple box that they come in and a VERY thick booklet featuring still photos with cast, movie, and maker information. All three of the Scream movies offer the same DVD features as their singular DVD release; they just put them into the boxed set. Then finally there is a fourth DVD, which offers much more for those of you with a DVD-ROM on your computer. It has web links, more pictures, more interviews, more making of features and the original script of Scream and even the original cast readings when they were trying out for the part. That's it and one last thing, try to pick this boxed set up for under forty bucks, not fifty or seventy which others are selling it for."
4,A Must-Have DVD Box Set.,"Everything you've read about the Scream films is true. The first film was phenomenal, and the follow-ups didn't quite live up to the original. But parts 2 and 3 are both good films in their own right, and the collection of all three Scream films will certainly stand the test of time.The DVD Box Set is a fan's dream come true. Each film has an entertaining, eye-opening commentary track which makes repeated viewing highly worthwhile. Deleted scenes and outtakes are an absolute pleasure to watch. Visual and Audio presentations are top-notch.A great addition to any DVD collection, and a must-have for fans of the horror genre."
2,I had to buy it,"As I work in the lift operations industry I had to buy this. Just for kicks. The acting is fair at best, the plot is weak and the idea that you can't hold onto the haul rope (the lift cable) with gloves on, because it is ""razor sharp"" was just too much to accept. One of my employees sums up the experience. ""I wish I had those 90 minutes back"". The best I can say is it's good for an occasional laugh on stormy days when we can't work."
4,"Frozen was ""chilling""","I have actually been stuck on ski lifts before - twice - so this hit a little close to home. As I watched the movie I could vividly remember just how cold I was, especially on one of the lifts, and I was only on it for about two hours. I don't know if you could actually live as long as these kids did in zero, sub-zero temps and blizzardy conditions but..All in all, this was a very well done movie. The character studies were done very well and the interactions were very true to life - girlfriend, boyfriend, long time buddy of the boyfriend.It just goes to show you that you don't need huge budgets, major special effects or computer graphics, zombies, vampires or other kinds of make-believe monsters for a story to be scary. Mother nature and human nature are scary enough!"
3,Did they try to hard?,"First off this is not a Horror film as it is stated by any means... I was say a more suspense action like film would suite it better off.Pros:Good StorylineCastCons:Bad ActingVERY slow paceUn-Realistic - Makes you feel like you are watching something that you already know the truth about, adds to the bore factor...As far as plot and underlines go its all included in the synopsis and descriptions here on A and I don't need to repeat it cause this ones doeskin deserve it!"
4,"Much better than Hatchet, doesn't take much","This film for me was a vast improvement on Hatchet-I haven't seen Spiral yet. I know Kevin Zegers from the original Air Bud, and I can honestly say he was just as good in this, writer/director Adam Green from Hatchet made a good script, with genuine fear, a creepy atmosphere, and likable charecters, overall. I was impressed with Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell as well. This film should NOT be put in the horror genre, more like a suspence/survival thriller. Independant filmmaking may well be the only way Hollywood can still come up with semi-new ideas. The slasher killer tactic is getting tired, re-makes are getting too predictable, the revenge storyline is getting very tired. But I've known that some people still have some new ideas, the only problem is, will audiences want to see them?I guess we'll see."
3,A tense if underwhelming effort,"Frozen is an interesting real-world horror tale from writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet, Spiral), in which a trio of college students (Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore, Emma Bell) find themselves trapped on a ski lift. Facing the peril of either freezing to death or risking deadly injury by dropping down to the ground below, Frozen can basically be described as being more similar to Open Water than anything else. That aside, that's not saying that there isn't anything to admire here. The three stars of the film are quite good, and Green manages to inject enough solid dialogue into the script to keep you interested in the characters and the goings on, but the pacing of the film is what really ends up bogging it down. Not to mention that by the time a voracious pack of wolves make their presence known, the authenticity of the film's logic just gets thrown out the window. Still, Frozen is worthwhile terror for what it's worth, and you could always do much worse than this."
1,TERRIBLE!! DON'T WATCH IT!!!!!!!,"What a terrible film and waste of time. The movie has zero argument and the roles are played poorly. no common sence whatsoever... why would you go skiing with no cellphone, no power bars, no water.... this is a really really really bad movie. DO NOT WATCH IT!!!"
1,Character Actions Implausible,"I bought this and started to watch it but the actions of the characters were so implausible I had to stop it. After the three knew they were trapped, a snow cat drives right under them. It even stops. Do they bother to throw down their skis or ski poles or something to alert the driver where they were? Nope. They do nothing. Lost me right there. It will go in the trash and I will never watch another Adam Green movie."
3,"Chilling story, obviously","Imagine getting stuck on a ski lift and the mountain resort closes down. This is what happens to the three young people in this film. It's a long drop if they jump off--which one does, with bad results, to say the least; there are wolves all over the place; no one is around to hear them yell; they lack the strength and leverage to climb up to the cable and try to make it all the way back to civilization; and so on.You will feel the frostbite on your face as they try to figure out what to do.Not a whole lot of story here, and quite a bit of R-rated language that gets tiresome, but for what it is, it is fairly effective.Brrrrr!"
2,Tedious and boring--I fast forwared to the end.,Don't be fooled by the great reviews--NOTHING happens for 26 mins.Then they are stuck--as are we with a go-nowhere plot with nothing to say.Skip it.
2,Odd,I really don't know what to say about this film other than I found it really odd. I didn't feel as though any plausible answers were given at the end and I was left wondering what the heck it had all been about. Very very odd film.
3,Good...but could have been better.,"When finishing looking at this movie...the special features are a must see, as theyshow you where they filmed and the winter storms that they had while filming andthey also answer some of the questions you get when watching this film.The actors/actress were only ok ...but the script is to be blamed here.I dont mind watching them though the movie sitting on that chairlift...but if asper the special features they had lots of bad winter weather happening during filming, i would have taught that some of those blizzard scenes could have beenedited in the film to give the audience the feeling of snow and cold...but lookingat the film, there were minimun scenes of bad weather. Sure we saw the snow comedown.....but it really felt like snowmachine snow instead of the real thing.Anyway...entertaining film...that could have been much more with better direction."
5,"WOW!! Scary, tense, fast paced","I didn't know what to expect from this little movie, just saw it because it looked interesting and had a pretty good rating. Glad I made this decision. This is a good movie - maybe not the most accurate in terms of what exactly would be going on in a person's body during this experience (for example - would they actually keep their legs down all this time? Would that not cause significant problems?) But do yourself a favor and suspend disbelief. Get on the the chair lift, start biting your nails and be grateful when the tension is at last done. Grim? Yes, but well worth the effort."
1,Horrible. NOT FUN. Hatchet was Fun,"well, I started watchingFrozenlast night on one of the Encore channels. It was Sooooo Bad I had to change the channel. I flipped back and it was still BAD. Acting Horrible. Are people, the way they are prtrayed in this movie, that stupid ??At least Hatchet was fun....."
1,Here's the Real Plot Summary,"A starved pack of wolves, which has somehow managed to survive a deadly winter storm at a New England ski resort, is about ready to give in to the cold and snow. Then, just when all seemed lost, the pack's leader comes up with an idea: ""Let's just wait by the ski lift, I bet some humans will be trapped on it before the end of the day!"" As it turns out, he's right, and over the next two days he leads his pack to a scrumptious feast and glory, and all is well again in the wolf world."
1,How did anyone like this movie?,How did anyone like this movie? What a waste of my time. The plot was so over the top. And the wolves? Please! I have to admit I did get alittle laugh from the movie. Thank goodness I saw it for free on Roku or else I would have wanted my money back. It was easier to watch it by fast forwarding every few minutes or so to get to the dumb ending.
1,Crap,"this movie honestly was one of the worst things I have seen in a long time. Terrible. Don't let reviews saying things like ""simple"" or ""Stremlined"" fool you..this is Junior High fiml school at it's worst. Terrible acting...really seriously unbelievably bad lines (not in an ironic sense either) ..lack of story....lack of suspense...uninteresting characters....and an ending that will leave you asking why you hung out that long.Terrible."
1,Pretty much a waste of time,Three young people get stuck on a ski lift for what could be a week. They try to escape. Hungry Wolves are lurking below them. Stupid dialog a boring plot. In my opinion a waste of time. If you have a weak stomach don't watch this. Better yet just don't waste your time and money.
1,"wow, bad, really bad!!!!","I've seen some bad movies before, but this one has got to be the worst! I know it's a movie and you're supposed to set aside all logical thinking, but c'mon, at least make it a tiny bit believable!! Some parts are soooo incredibly ridiculous!! wow, it was really bad!!!!!!"
4,An entertaining movie,"Some reviewers will write a ""Deep Frozen Water"" or ""Jaws with Paws"" style of review. That might be a valid criticism except most moves have been ""done"". I am not sure that we have much ""original"" movies, books or television. I am not looking for a deep message or an original concept but do want to be entertained.This is an entertaining move. The story is believable, the dialog accurate and the failing of the system on target. The result is a solid story, well filmed that is enjoyable. If you like movies pitting kids against an implacable foe, you should like this one."
4,Frozen DVD,"Frozen will keep even the most jaded lover of horror films interested, near the edge of a seat, and away from the ""channel changer"". You'll be thinking ""I know how this ends"" but it probably will surprise you. Worth the price of admission - recommended - especially on a cold night in a dark room."
3,"Eh, it's ok...","This movie is good, but not great. Yes, it is original in the fact that the threat is nature and not someone chasing you or something. How much plot can there be to this type of scenario? It does get boring because let's face it, 90% of the movie is filmed on one scene. This is a plot where it makes a great survivor story but not great movie. Check it out for yourself, you may like it more, but it's not something I recommend. I'm torn between it being a waste of your time or worth your time...you decide."
2,Movie is freezing up on me,"This dvd is freezing up at the end of the movie. Every time I watch it, the movie stops at the same spot or it freezes."
3,Very odd movie,"This is a very odd movie. It is a psycho killer movie that you better not turn away from for even a second or you will have to watch it again just to understand what is going on. It is very in depth and twisted. Richard Armitage makes it worth it but just be warned, it is weird."
3,review,the overall concept was good but the acting was very amateurish and the plot was so awfully thought out that it was laughable.
2,Not something I would recommend,"just not very good acting really, seemed to be very low budget and pretty unbelievable as far as the plot"
3,frozen is fun,"the cover was all messed up but the disc played great! i ordered a good condition, so i guess i got what I wanted."
1,Sucked,I really disliked this movie. It did have good actors but it did not live up to my expectations. I would not recomendation this movie.
3,An enjoyable movie,"Frozen is not as good as the best reviewers claim, nor is it as bad as the negative reviews suggest. Despite some obvious plot holes that have already been mentioned, I found Frozen to be very enjoyable and exciting. It works best as sort of psychological horror, not a straight-up horror film--it clearly isn't. The lead actress is very good. Engage your imagination, suspend your disbelief and enjoy it."
3,Review Based on Advance Copy,"I received an advance copy of ""Frozen"" from the distributor for the website I write reviews for.I'll be brief here: The movie is good with some caveats. Adam Green both writes and directs, and his direction is better than his writing.He definitely keeps the suspense going through several key scenes, so I'd give it a B to B+ for directing.However, the script needed to be better. As I said in my full review at the website, there are too many coincidences that strain plausibility. Once you get to the part where the kids are stranded for good on the ski lift, it's fine, but getting them there took too many worst case scenarios for it to be totally believable.Another draft of the script might have kicked my rating up a star. Definitely worthwhile as a rental, but only consider purchasing because the price is so low now. If you're still on the fence after reading this and my full review, just rent it."
3,Worth watching once.,"I saw a preview on Frozen and thought I would watch it. I'm not in to these kinds of movies so I wasn't sure how I would like it. The movie was okay. Not the best movie I have ever watched, but not the worst either. The acting and story was okay. It is scary to think something like that could happen to you. It was worth watching once, but don't think I would ever watch it again."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","This movie was pretty good. The only troubling thing was that this movie took place it Extreme cold,yet there was NO SMOKE coming from the mouths of the actors. This made all the scenes look Fake."
3,Believable horror story; simple yet effective.,"A horror film with lots of tension and a believable scenario involving the main characters. No psychopaths wielding axes, aliens taking over bodies, zombies roaming the earth, or psychological nightmares. It's just a simple, plausible plot where 3 people are stuck on a ski lift, 50 feet in the air, and the atrocities they endure trying to free themselves. A little gore and a lot of suspense. The main drawbacks were some slow moving moments, and some early side plots that really don't go anywhere and appear only as attempts to keep the film at a normal run time.Overall, if you're looking for a real life terror flick, this is it. A simple yet believable twist in the horror genre. Keep in mind it is still a B-movie, so don't expect juicy dialogue or sweeping visuals, but you may hardly notice once the suspense kicks in."
2,Mediocre suspense/horror film is chilling but that's about all,"This film has the feel of a TV movie. The acting is decent and the story is OK, yet the film is unsatisfying. The characters don't get developed that well until the drama is fully unfolding, and the film is really just focused on the trauma of the 3 young adults trapped on the ski lift and their diminishing hopes for survival. When the final rescue scene comes to its quick conclusion the viewer may also be saying ""thank God this is over."" Unless you are a real fan of this type of cinematic terrorizing suspense you may want to pass on this film."
2,fast but scratchy,My DVD was scratched and unwatcgable. It arrived fast the only thing good about my order. my dvd was scratched to the point that I had to stop watchng the film it skippedd and somtimes completely stopped
4,Nerve-wracking!,"A few minor spoilers. I was lucky enough to see this in the theater and I think that might have helped. Its a shame this didn't get a wider release because the big screen added something to the experience. I am of the opinion that the characters tried just about everything I could think of being trapped 70-plus feet in the air, and when you can't second-guess them, it makes the situation even more terrifying. I thought the acting was great, the dialogue was decent but***SPOILERS***the addition of the wolves was not necessary. It did add another level of awful to their situation, but I also thought it was a bit ham-handed. I honestly don't think wolves would act like that unless they were starving. But hey, maybe these were. I think it would have been a bit more believable if there were a bit of foreshadowing earlier about the ski resort having some trouble with wolves. But again, their situation is terrifying enough without them."
2,Really awful,Not very likable characters from the start. One set of dumb decisions and impossible scenarios after another. I have no idea why this movie costs more than most to rent. It's not worth it.
4,"Not the best, but not bad either.","If you like suspense-driven movies, Frozen is for you. It is about surviving the unsurvivable, and what happens when people are thrown into a deadly situation beyond their control. In essence, Frozen explores the psychology of people who are torn between the fear of being trapped and the need to continue to live. It is this tension which drives the film. I would not call this a horror film, and to be honest, I have no idea why it was marketed as one."
3,Meal time for the wolf pack,"If ever caught in this highly unlikely predicamentwhere karma and Murphy's Law are your best buddieswhile stranded on a ski lift, try bending (or not) aski pole to zip-line down the sharp cable and backto a fairly safer land. Of course, the characters aren'tin the habit of using their brains, but rather choosethe more painful and difficult options.This is not on the same level as Jaws as a pack ofunbelievably intelligent, man-eating, ski resort wolvesare a poor comparison to a demon-like Great White. Andthe cast of Frozen evidently can't compare to the actingtrio of Jaws.Sure, Frozen has its intensity and those realisticcringing moments, but they are few and far between thefilm's filler of inane dialogue. It's not until 30 or40 minutes into the film that the intensity slowly develops.The characters are one dimensional and obnoxious, whichcertainly detracts from the film's emotional impact."
4,Interesting movie with a few unrealistic moments,"Going into this movie I admit I didn't expect much from it, I thought it would be really cheesy. But I found it to be interesting and it definitely kept my attention the whole way through, so it exceeded my expectations. The acting did wobble in areas, the dialogue was juvenile at times and there were some really unrealistic moments where you wondered why any sane person would make that choice and not go with the logical choice. I thought the wolves were unrealistic and not true to the location or their natural behavior either. But it's just a movie so I went with it. There was no gratuitous nudity that seems so typical in this type of movie, so kudos to them on that. It's not going to win an Oscar, but it was a good film and is better than a lot of the garbage out there."
2,I didn't get it!,"I'm into mystery movies however I just didn't get this one, totally lost interest within the first 10 minutes! Sorry I just can't think of something good to say about this movie..."
5,Frozen,"I like the movie and it is realistic. Yes, something like this could happen in the real world of skiing. About 3 skiers stranded on a ski lift and they close the ski area down. They do not open until the next weekend. One skier jumps to his death when he breaks a leg and stray hungry wolves attack him. The only one to survive is the female."
1,Not what I hoped for,"One star only because I can't give it no stars. I was looking for traditional Native American/Eskimo songs. Saw this group on ""Flying Wild Alaska"" and I thought that was what they played/recorded. Nope, looks more like they're trying to emulate rappers. I was very disappointed."
4,Great for beginners,I'd say is a good tool set for beginners before wasting a lot of money on professional tools. If you take care of them and oil properly on each use you will have a descent tools set for a long time. They are a good purchase for the low price.
5,bonsai tools,not at all what i expected i was expected them to be small i'm excitedBonsai Tool 10-piece Sethave not used them yet
1,Bonsai tools,"I guess for $5.00 a piece, I cannot complain too loudly. The biggest pair of prunners is very hard to use. The next tools I buy will be done in person. Thank you, Carol"
4,Good Stuff,This is a really good set of Bonsai tools and I have used them a lot. They are well made and durable.
3,Insightful Biography of Televisions Best!,"Along with Lucille Ball and Betty White, Mary Tyler Moore is one of TV's most famous women! This A&E Biography starts at the begining [of her life] until when this biography was produced. There are many intimate photographs of Mary in her childhood and adolecents, and even emotional stills of her and her late son, Ritchie. There are many interviews with Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Dick van Dyke Show cast mates, along with personal friends. There are many clips from various series. One dissapointment was this should have been 2-Hours to accomidate more footage from various roles! (That's what nocked it down to a 3!) For die hard fans only, otherwise tape it on an A&E re-run!"
1,nowhere to find the questions (no conact information),"The only reason I bought this book is because of the questions with the book. Apparently, the book does not contain questions! it points to a website to download: www.ewrox.net, which is a a bad link to nowhere! what's worse, that's the only contact information on the book. I can not even contact any of the authors for any questions. Can the person that wrote the 5 star review please share with me your path to get the right information?"
5,Best book for exam and link is working,"zuir from MA, USA, the link and the website is working you might have mistyped it wrong and also all the questions and labs are also listed on the website after you register at http://www.ewrox.net thru the members link.The questions are great and also the labs are, if you have anymore questions send an email to infor@ewrox.net and they will respond.Keep up the good work."
1,Hare-Brained,This book delivers so much less than it promises that I have found it virtually useless in training actual human beings. Maybe it was tested on hares. You would do much better (and be much more creative) coming up your own exercises.
5,Just what I was looking for,"I collect men's boots and leather. I've always wanted a guide like this. It's straight forward. Has category overviews (UNIFORMS, SPORTS, LEATHER, FANTASY/GOTH, UNDERWEAR, etc.) and A-Z listings, encyclopedia style. Has price and collecting recommendations. But I particularly like the website links, and catalog information. It's also fun just to open it to any page, look at a listing and the cross-references. I've discovered some new clothing fetishes (kilts, metal chain, leather masks), and have found some great info on collecting police and military uniforms, as well as jockstraps and cod pieces. COOL LITTLE BOOK!"
1,A non-starter and very difficult to get help,This item new did not work. The Memorex customer support advised its return and had no suggestions to get it to work. It is no longer produced. I would advise against purchasing this DVD non-player.
3,joseph and his brothers,Very good but the story is weaker than some of the other Great Adventures of the Bible series.
3,Very artsy,"This calendar is too stylized for my taste; white dogs on a white background with oversized faces might be okay for the ""artist"". I prefer the bichon in a natural outdoor or homey indoor setting. It was no surprise that this is a foreign production."
1,Scammer!!!,"I would LOVE to give you a review, but BLUE CLOUD BOOKS NEVER SENT IT AND AMAZON IS A PIECE OF YOU-KNOW-WHAT!!!"
1,Charles Thompson is just wrong!!!!!!,"Charles Thompson and his book of lies. No one brought him to the lifestyle he was involved in. Barry Switzer offered him a chance to play football and get and education for free and he blew that opportunity. I am sick of hearing how Barry ruined all these guys lives. No one hired Switzer to baby sit, but to win football games. But, as long as we criticize winners as college football coaches, what about Bowden. The guy basically has the same mentality and no one bashes him. Come on people, don't waste the time and money on this piece of garbage."
1,Poorly Written Textbook,"This is a poorly written textbook. It is dry, uninformative and lacks any cohesive organization that would make the material easier to understand. The author uses a set template for each topic (Advantages, Disadvantages, Tax Implications etc.) that sometimes fits and sometimes does not fit the topic at hand. In more than one case, there are bullet items that repeat the same text as previously bulleted items. This is just sloppy editing and a lack of attentiveness ..."
2,Not for average consumer,"I do not recommend this book as a main source of information for the average reader. It is informational, but probably incomplete and not useful in deciding which plan to implement. It is used as a supplement (not even the main textbook) in an advanced Certified Financial Planning (CFP) course. Students in this course already have proven knowledge of key concepts regarding taxes, investments, risk management-insurance, etc. This is tough education/training that is being undertaken by people who's main job is (will be) to advise on these subjects."
4,Talk about Cheesy!!,"Ok, I liked the story and all, but I must say this was the most ""cheeziest"" romance novel I have read! Talk about naivety! The sad thing is that there are people out there like Miss Lena that lead a life just hers, not having friends and not knowing anything about the outside world! But just like Lena did they can come into themselves only if they would just try. I know I went a little off on that, but that is how I feel about this story. But after all that the story was good. Lena and Quincey's relationship was so so cute. Read for yourself and you'll see!!"
3,Loving for the first time and loving deep,I thought this was a really sweet story. Lena reminds me of myself. Shy around men. Quincy enters the picture and she opens up for the first time. Of course there is that chance of being hurt. A risk we all must take. It's a wonderful story.
5,Wonderful,"First love is the story of Shy Lena, who's never even had a boyfriend at the age of 25, until she meets Quincy a new guy at her job, who finds himself attracted to Lena even though she is not the type he is use to dating. How these two overcome Lena's shyness to become a couple is wonderful."
4,Pleasant/Smooth,"I really did enjoy this book. The story was well put together. It was very smooth and exciting. I enjoyed the meeting of souls, the getting together and the love that was felt during the entire story. It was so good, for a moment, I thought I know these people. Very entertaining, it will keep you interested, and occupied. Great writing,adventure, mystery and overall interesting."
3,check it out from the library instead,"I'm new to coin collecting so I think I'm probably the target audience. Although he covered a lot of ground, I felt it was quite short on detail. For example, he really only examines 2 of the grading services, so I still don't know how all the others compare. I'd borrow it, enjoy the easy to read style, take a few notes, and then spend my money on an other one. Which one, I don't know."
4,Inspired reminiscing,"This journal provides ample room to jot down details of your trip, as well as to reflect and reminisce on the journey. Whimsical, inspiring quotations about travel at the top of each page help to jumpstart your thoughts or simply accent your writing. Lightweight, easy to tuck in your backpack and pull out when you have a minute."
5,Liked it,My girls loved these. Not as durable as I would have liked but are great for the imagination and fun
5,Magnificent and Bigger than Life,"I love Redwoods, and so when I followed links from a tv nature minute I discovered the filmakers made this full length film and I ordered it immediately. I have watched it several times and every time I am facinated with the grand scale that life in one organism can live. It has lovely music and leading edge researchers with newest discoveries about these wonderous beings. Better than a nature show, this covers all 3 groups of trees on both sides of the Pacific ocean. Awe inspiring!"
5,smooth harmonies & up beat tempo songs are the best on here!,"If you don't know who the Barrio Boyzz are...where have you been? These Boyzz are the greatest! The ""Ven a mi"" cd is great to listen to if you want to party. ""Rico"", ""Se me fue mi vida"" ""Loquera"" are the best songs! And if you like slow songs...theres ""Ven a mi ""(which is my favorite) ""Sere tu rio"" ""Si eres tu"" are good to relax to. I like the harmonies and smooth flava these guys have. It truely deserves 5 stars!"
5,Barrio Boyzz style is what I always remember about them!,"I have all of the Barrio Boyzz's albums, and they always deliver their music with that same sound that is all their own. This album was no different to me because I love their music and they really have been blessed with a talent that they know how to use. I hope that they are coming out with a new release/album soon. I want the Barrio Boyzz to know that I have faith in them and I hope that they do too. You guys will always have a loyal fan in me. Keep up the good work and keep that calor style! Buena suerte!"
1,"Harness Boot 12""","Size 12EEE the top of the boots is to small for a big foot to go in,needs to be big at the top for a 12EEE will go in."
1,Not a Real Pilates Workout,"I was very disappointed by this tape. I have learned that I prefer tapes and books by actual Certified Pilates instructors. This tape is also not good for people who don't like to use ""props"" while exercising - you'll need a scarf, a tennis ball... Lynne Robinson also contradicts other instructors in the description of the ""navel to spine"" technique - a key element in doing Pilates correctly. While this video may have benefit in terms of exercise, don't buy it if you want a true Pilates workout."
4,"Good Content, no bells & whistles","The set is awful. The music isn't great. But Lynne knows her stuff & is very gentle. It feels a lot like yoga, unlike a lot of Pilates videos & dvds out there. Definitely a good choice for a beginner, or someone who wants to get into Pilates but has some physical limitations they need to be careful of."
4,"It's for body control, not a hulking work out","I've used this DVD for the intention of unwinding, streaching out and centering. I don't expect to get a super fat burning workout from this dvd. It's perfect for in the morning if your back or neck is stiff. It's very controlled and meant for beginners, people with injuries, or people with medical conditions that keeps them from doing all out, break your neck, pilates moves such as the ""jacknife"". So don't bash it if you didn't get sweaty doing it...that's not it's purpose."
1,Hard to get motivated in performing excercises,I got the set of three vidoes. It may have all the Pilates exercise but it miss to have the right sequence in performing it. Also it lacks the motivation in performaing the routine. I got the other video by Dennis which is very well organized.
2,Disappointing,"Well, I agree with a lot of the comments people had here, one thing that wasn't brought up was that the flow from exercise to exercise wasn't there. One minute, she's doing a standing routine, the next second, she's on the floor and doing the next exercise. I found that quite distracting and unhelpful. The best Pilates workout video is Winsor pilates."
2,Should have been called Pilates for the Elderly,I am rating this at two starts because the movements were way to slow and to few to get a real workout for the average person. If they had merely advertised this as a Pilates training video for the Elderly or maybe for people going through rehabilitation I would have scored it much higher.
5,excellent,The product is working good and the time for me to get the product was great. i will order again in the future. Ken Girty
1,Not worth it,"This is a very poor vcr. I have only used it a few times and when I put it on ""record"" it will stop recording halfway thru the program. This also happens when I use the programmable recording. Either way its a piece of junk. I've bought different brands of tapes and it doesn't make any difference. If you are able to record (which has only happened once) the playback is awful. Save your money!!!!!!"
1,beware buying on internet,"I purchased this item and was very surorised at the speed it was delivered- BUT- I connected it and was going to record a program that i really wanted ,as it was the only time it was to be aired. i put a tape in the slot-NOTHING- to make a long story short i contacted the service dept of sylvania and got the address and phone nr, of the closest waranty repair shop-72 miles after a trip there and a wait of three weeks i finally had my recrder back. so check carefully anything you buy on the web"
4,Good VCR,"I own two of the Sanyo versions of these VCR's. They were manufactured as the SANYO vwm-950, and the Sylvania 6260vd. I have had one of these VCR's for 2 1/2 years now, and one for just over one year. Both are working well, play great, with good picture and sound. I have them fed into my surround sound system, and it is excellent to watch movies with. I highly recommend this vcr for a low cost good output, and reliable way to play your old videos. 4 heads, stereo input and output, easy to set up and use. Check these out, good buy."
4,Satisfactory Purchase Experience,"Delivery time seemed a little long and the seller included an S-video cable and the unit didn't have an S-video jack, but otherwise I got what I expected - nothing more, nothing less."
4,"Cheap, but works longer than you'd think!","Despite the Sam's Club price that made me think it would break in a month, this video player/recorder has now lasted two years of basement kid's movie playing - which during the winter can be daily. The instructions are vague and you have to fuss with it intuitively (I'm not good at this and get frustrated)to make it do some of it's more ""complicated"" feats, but work it does. For the price, you can't beat it."
3,Functional but not durable,"The concept is good, but the manufacture is flimsy. The knobs came apart after a few uses, so now I use a pair of pliers to turn the knobs. Rated 3 because what good is a product if it is not functional and only going to decorate your countertop?"
5,Tip of the Ice Berg,"The present volume of stories is just the tip of the iceberg. An exhibition that showcases what a fine story teller Isaac Asimov. The highlight of most stories of Asimov is his ability to visualise the future not just in terms of technological advances, but also its impact on human behaviour. If this is the first book of Asimov you are reading then you are well on your way to becoming a fan.choorie@ rediffmail.com"
2,Not Great,"I was disappointed in this book. After reading the reviews, I thought I had a pretty good shot of passing, even though it had been years since I'd been in school. I did well on the Reading and Writing, since these are skill sets I use on a daily basis. I knew I would find the Math difficult.All three sections of the book seemed more challenging that the book by The Princeton Review. The math was much more difficult. I studied off and on for about two weeks, especially the Math sections, but did not feel that the book was helpful in explaining all of the new information on the test.The text has been revised over the last couple of years; the Princeton Review for the CBEST is still basically the same book since 2004. I will need to retake the Math, which is no big dea; however, I found the book disappointing."
5,Very helpful and easy to understand.,"I recently took the CBEST test on Feb. 07, 2009, and I just got an email for my unofficial scores today (02/23/09), and I passed! This book really helped me understand how to solve the different types of problems, and where to start when writing the essays for the test. There were probably only a couple of problems on the actual CBEST test that I did not know at all. This book was very helpful. I just wish this author wrote one for the CSET test. =)"
4,Good Book,"It's a good book & I studied this book in the last weeks of my preparation but still failed the Cbest test. The Maths part really helped me, the reading was okey but barron's is better if you are really weak in the reading section. I prepared the essays according to this book but still failed so i have to figure out another way to get through the essay writing. Overall good book to crack math and may be reading for some."
5,I Cracked the CBEST!,"Using only this excellent resource, I passed the CBEST on the first try after a few weeks of preparation. This book is organized and written very well, and provides a solid foundation for all three subtests. I particularly needed help with math, and Cracking the CBEST helped me score very well on the math subtest. The author also provides great test-taking strategies. I found the practice tests especially helpful. This was the only resource I used, and it did the trick!"
1,Be careful,Be careful. This product will not work with Windows 7 and Cosmi support is so convoluted as to be of no use.
3,Not for Widetrack Jeep Cherokees/Wagoneers,"I purchased this to replace my tie rod ends. All the websites I could find pointed to this item as the one I needed. Unfortunately, I didn't realize until I got it on that it was too short. I had to go and order a new, correct tie rod. The construction is great, the part is high quality, just the wrong one.If you have a Widetrack Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer, this is the part number you need: MOOG DS915Moog DS915 Steering Center Link Tie Rod End"
3,Georgie and the Robbers,"Georgie's back. Originally published in 1963, The Georgie series features Georgie the ghost and his friends. In this book,the timid little ghost who lives with the Whittakers must find enough courage to scare off some robbers. The blue pencil illustrations are the same as in the original book. Perhaps this book will be more popular with sentimental adults who remember it from their childhood than their children or grandchildren."
2,NOISE overpowers the audio to much!!!,"I got this on sale at Sears and I hate it! I paid about $79 plus tax for it and my cheap one from the Black Friday special at Walmart for $29(Apex AD-1130W)works better than this one.I did a search for ""Why does my DVD player make so much noise"" and that's how I ended up here. One consumer wrote you get what you pay for and that is mostly true BUT I lucked out with the Walmart special. Look that one up and see if you can find it and buy it for the kid's room or a guest room."
3,BEWARE!!!,"The knives are five star all the way. Shun makes amazing knives.But if you paid for a wood handle set and get a steel handle set, you HAVE BEEN CHEATED. Search for:shun stainless handle steak knives...and you will see that many places offer the stainless handel set for as little as $199. Wood handle sets cost way more, and if you paid for the wood handle set and got stainless steel, absolutely get your money back and raise hell with the merchant.Once again I stress that the knives themselves -- whether stainless handle or wood -- deserve five starsBut ONLY if that is what you paid for."
5,Cause everyone needs a web page,"Published 2007, with lots of custom forms, images, and even instruction for animation! Lots to choose from, easy to use, very reasonable in price."
4,music for ballet class,"The only thing i was not to happy about the bands of songs were short, but i did like the music..."
2,Does not last,"Absolutely love this drill (and all the tools) but not the longevity. Despite the infrequency of use, the battery/charger do not last. I am also unable to obtain a replacement part and must purchase a new drill."
1,Help This Book Sucks Like Hell,As a fictional suspense this was not a very good suspense book I thought it was really crapy. I expected a good story with at least some scary things and some suspense.This bookis about two young girls who disobey their father and leave the car two go into the library. So far reading the first chapter I thought it was boring. When they are in the library the librarian leaves and when the lights go out they realize they are traped in the library. I thought this was so boring there are no scary things and no suspense you can always plainly see what is coming next
3,A Great Book To Share,"Reading this book aloud and sharing it with others is definitely the way to go. It has just enough suspense and humour to keep children interested, and just enough points for discussion to make it worthwhile for a good text to share and discuss. The character maybe me more of caricatures, or at the very least exaggerated, but they are familiar enough for the reader to identify with, and the descriptions are well enough written for a book of this kind. A short and enjoyable read."
5,Still remember this from my childhood,I read this when I was 7. I still remember it well over two decades later. I LOVED this book. Younger readers will get a thrill out of it.
3,Pages were very yellow,"This book was rated ""new"" condition but pages were yellow and some corners were bent. I bought this for my grandson to read and then donate to the school because the one they sent home with him was in very terrible condition. Not sure he'll actually donate this one because it sure doesn't look ""new""."
4,HELP!,"Libraries are supposed to be a place to research and study right? But instead two girls are somehow trapped in the place of knowledge! To make matters worst, both girls dicover more and more freaky and dangerous secrets than you could ever imagine! How can the two girls survive? Will they ever get rescued?READ the BOOK to FIND OUT!"
3,A Nice book!,"On a snowy winter's night Mary Rose and Jo-Beth travel to an aunt's house where they will stay until their mother gives birth to the newest addition to the Onetree family. When their car runs out of gas, they are told to lock the car doors and wait until Mr. Onetree returns with a full can of gas. But soon after Mr. Onetree leaves, Jo-Beth has an emergency and the two girls search for a bathroom. What they find is an old library. While in the building, they are locked inside -- and suddenly things begin to happen. The girls question if the library is haunted or if there is a logical explanation for the scary occurrences.Children between the ages of 6-10 will enjoy Help! I'm a Prisoner in the Library. It is an easy-to-read book that will keep the children turning the pages."
3,Good product / protection,"These are not as good as the Weathertech molded floor mats, but they do protect the floor well. Weathertech doesn't make the molded mats for my older truck I just purchased, unfortunately. They're cheaper at least."
2,NOT SO COMPLETE,"While this book may abound in drills, very little attention is paid to discussing positional play, and what benefit is derived by each position from these drills. At best this book is geared to the elite level coach who already has an indepth understanding of the game and is only looking for something new to use in practices.To the neophyte coach, I would suggest taking the USA Hockey coaching certification clinics or, at the least, buying their coaching manuals which have a detailed reasoning behind each skill development drill.Ultimately the job of the coach is to develop the player's skills, and unfortunately Complete Hockey Instruction does nothing to help the coach in this regard."
1,inefficient service,"The estimated delivery window was September 17. It's Sept. 20th , the textbook is not even shipped yet. Contacted the seller, no response. I would not recommend for future orders."
5,Clear headed and practical,"This is a very informative book that clears up lots of misconceptions. It explains why the ""wellfare state"" is still around, even after so many death notices. The analysis shows that there is no net negative cost for comprehensive and universal social programs, and that there are often significant benefits. For those who can read this book without ideological and political blinders, there is much to learn from Peter Lindert's book."
5,Your best hopes confirmed,"Peter Lindert has done humanity a great service, settled many scores, and given us both a perspective and a vocabulary with which to address the contentious issue of social spending and wealth transfer.""Growing Public"" is one of the greatest contributions to Economic theory in the past century. Anyone with a social conscience owes it to himself to read this book and make its findings widely known.One of the book's many virtues (it is based upon very hard historical data) is that it is entirely readable."
1,I did not have any luck at all,"The book sounds so promising...well, out of 26 letters mailed out, asking for a note or photo congratulating my son on his Eagle rank, so far, 11 have come back, all with notes like""address unknown"" or ""does not exist""...this is a waste of my time and money; the book and the postage to deal with the requests...I contacted the publisher about getting money back on the book and they laughed at me! It isn't their fault; ""stars change their agents all the time; so it doesn't stay current and it isn't our fault""...They advertise that they stand behind their sources..I say, don't waste your money on this!"
5,The ultimate homeopathic reference guide for cats!,"If you have a cat or cats and you would like to learn more about the use of homeopathy in treating cats, this book is for you! Written by someone who was a great leader in the use of homeopathy with animals, there is no book written by any American author that can remotely compare with this one! I run a small, private feline sanctuary and this book has probably saved me THOUSANDS of dollars in vet bills."
3,This book should be used with caution.,"This is a very detailed book for homeopathic remedies for cats. Each remedy is well described, but if you're serious about homeopathy you'll need a competent Materia Medica.Moreover, the layout of the book follows an allopathic index, meaning by dis-ease and not by symptom. It may be useful to the novice but has nothing to do with classical homeopathy. I'd suggest you get Don Hamilton's book instead.Unless you have already used homeopathy on yourself, I'd advise against using this book. Explore homeopathy in depth before using these on you cat."
5,drug free cats,"To know that there is an alternative to drugs which compromises the health of my cat's liver & kidneys and ultimately her longevity is comforting. Even flees can be controlled with sulpher rather than poison in her bloodstream. The highly advertised flee control by the drug companies and celebrities cashing in, makes people feel guilty if they don't use this expensive product. Read the book and find a homeopathic vet who does phone consultations and who sends you the remedy by post and you will have a healthier cat. It takes longer to recover but your cat will be better for it. And our precious little cats are worth it."
2,Only A Veterinarian Will Know The Terminology,"A lay person will not find this book helpful. I don't know if a modern day homeopathic vet will like it either. The antiquated remedies are not so much homeopathic as just plain old, from the moldy old years 100's of years ago. Many of the prognosis of symptoms and suggested remedies look downright dangerous, using the limited source of usual lab concoctions they made for, experimented on, sick pets and animals. Besides which, if you can understand 4 medical terms in the whole book you'll be lucky, this book was written for other practicing veterinarians from the turn of the century, all script is written in full medical terminology."
1,Really?,"[...] Please, if your pet is sick, it's fair to treat it with medicine, not water. Unless it's dehydrated. Please read up before replying."
4,The outsourced Royal Albert,"My original Royal Albert pieces were made in England. This new piece was made in Indonesia. Whereas The pieces look good on the initial cursory inspection, this cup teaters slightly on the saucer. However, the ones from England were flawless. I will note that the English pieces were manufactured in 1962. Whether it's the place of manufacture or modern methods versus the method 40 years ago, I couldn't say. If you aren't put off by the slight lacking in precision, the new pieces should do alright by you. If you want perfection, hold out for the old British made ones."
5,Royal Albert Old Country Roses teacup,"Teacup arrived in excellent shape. The older version had a less defined gold edge. This one looks more ""dishwasher safe."""
5,Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words,Great for learning the definate meanings of words in the New Testament.My Sis in Law uses it all the time in her Bible Studies.
4,Bloodbath delivers,"I bought this dvd for the old NWA footage and wasn't disappointed. The mighty fueds of Rick Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA vs. Tully Blanchard, and the Andersons vs. the Rock and Roll Express are covered here.Since Sammartino and Backlund were part of the WWWF (eventually shortened to WWF) I had never seen them wrestle until now. Even though Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka is shown here from the WWF, he was in the NWA/Mid Atlantic Championship wrestling area sometime in the early 80's, winning the NWA World Tag Team belts with Ray Stevens. In fact, there was a spectacular tag team cage match between Snuka/Stevens and Steamboat/Youngblood, circa 1980 (not on this dvd).I didn't care much for anything post 1995 on these 2 dvd's.Note: There are a couple of hidden dvd features.And be forewarned - if you don't have the stomach for the site of blood, stay away from this dvd set."
2,Very much a let down,"This collection is more of a documentary on the history of steel cage matches in the WWE. The documentary itself would be okay for a television viewing, but not a slightly overpriced DVD that advertises itself as something that it isn't. There were some matches that barely had any blood if any. Up and beyond that, most of these matches could almost be considered mid-card match ups as far as quality.One that that was upsetting are that there are no WCW cage matches circa 1990 on the disc. Wargames in that era were the only place a wrestling fan could find great, bloody matches guilt free (it was rare to see blood on WCW any other times, but when you did it was well worth the wait).I don't even feel this is worthy of a match-for-match rundown. If you find it cheap used, definitely pick it up, but I'd recommend waiting until it's in the $3.99 bin at your local pharmacy."
3,"""Bloodbath"" DVD Review!","The finest cage matches in wrestling history are showcased in this two-disc collection. Well, sort of. It's only the standard steel cage matches (specially-designed cage matches like Hell In A Cell, Elimination Chamber, and War Games aren't included). In all honesty, these aren't exactly the best cage matches in wrestling. You get to see Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart from Summerslam 1994 (a bloodless and somewhat boring 40-minute technical match), Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon, the legendary Jimmy Snuka vs. Don Muraco match, and a couple of other odd choices. It would have been cool to see them include an ECW cage match or two and the Hogan vs. Bundy match at Wrestlemania II. (the first and only Wrestlemania main event in a steel cage). Seeing as the WWE has well over 30+ years of matches from WWF, WCW/NWA, ECW, and AWA in their video library, they could have certainly come up with a far more impressive collection."
5,Raw Magazine Run Down,I just saw the DVD ad in the November 2003 issue of RAW. There is over 3.5 hours of bonus material-11 complete matches. The extra matches included are:Bruno Sammartino vs. Ivan Koloff 1975Bob Backlund vs. Stan Hansen 1981Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes 1986Rock 'n' Roll Express vs. Andersons 1986Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty 1993
5,great book for beginners,"this is a great book for beginners, it gives you all the tips and tools you need to get started."
5,Great for the beginner,They were right at being the book for the beginner. What a great way to learn with step by step directions.
3,Better books on the market,"After reviewing this book; there are better books that I read. One being quilting for dummies. ""Your first quilt book"", did not supply me with the basics in a interesting format."
3,"Helpful, but too simple","This book is good, especially for beginner as I am, but the projects are a bit too simple - all of them. I woul also like to see more colour photos inside.So I've made my first quilt using another book. But the little quilter's dictionnary from ""Your first Quilt book"" was very helpful indeed, so I don't regret buying this book."
1,This book has no color photos.,This book is like a computer manual. It's not very exciting and has no color photos to inspire me. I think there are better books out there for the beginner.
5,For beginners,This is the best quilt book I have found for learning to quilt. It has so many practical hints and the steps to follow are precise and complete. I use it all the time. I'm so glad my friend recommended it to me.
4,Great Quilt Book For the Beginner,"Need to learn all those quilting terms (fat quarters, fat eighths, charm packs)? This is a great little book for learning all the very basic quilting terms and hints for laying out and sewing your first quilt."
5,Can't say enough great things!!,"Search no more! I am in the process of taking a quilting class and this is the required reading. I could actually learn to quilt straight from the book, no instructor necessary (and I am a complete novice). It's so simply written and so thorough."
4,An excellent resource for the novice quilter.,As a beginning quilter I found this book to be excellent. The projects are easy to complete in a limited amount of time and give you quite a sense of accomplishment. A must for your quilting library.
4,HIGHLY RECOMMEND Your First Quilt Book,I puchased this book when it was first published. I had been quilting for 5 years at that time. I still learned new ideas. Carol Doak has been quilting/teaching for a long time and that shows (I've taken several classes with her).
5,fun book,"I got this quilting book for my daughter, she really loved it. she is just starting to quilt and said this was very helpful."
3,First quilt book? maybe,"I consider myself a beginner quilter; I've made 6 hand-tied quilts and still don't feel very confident. This book is an encylopedia of information--that's its good part. If one knows nothing of quilting, one could certainly find answers here. But it was overwhelming to me (and quite boring). If I had picked this book up before I ever made a quilt, I'd have never continued. Hopefully others are more tenacious."
4,It was helpful to me who had never used a sewing machine,"It was not very long and I'll admit it could have had more details. But I had never even used a sewing machine before and in one weekend I had made myself one of the lap quilts in that book. It turned out beautifully. So it was helpful to me, although it could have had more instructions on finishing your quilt..."
4,"Good basic, book","This book is a good, but very simplistic book. It was a good start for me, but once I got the basics down, it wasn't as helpful."
2,Your First Quilt Book,"This is a nice little book on quilting, however, I was looking for something more basic. I want to see a list of tools I will need to begin, (aside from a regular sewing machine, and/or needle and thread). Next, I want s simple project to work on, e.g. a potholder or placemat. With that project I want step by step instructions on how to proceed. (e.g. type of textiles to use, how to lay them out, how much seam allowance to add, and how to piece it together.)This book has a few pictures of some of the named quilt designs, but the photo's are too small, and don't give you a good overall idea of how it looks. I would like to see some full-page color photos of several historical quilt types, with a note about what they are called, and why. An example would be the ""Wedding Ring Quilt'"" etc."
2,"Martin Amis's debut tries to be funny, but isn't","I was utterly diappointed by Martin Amis's novel ""Rachel Papers"". The over-use of sex in this book doesn't make it any more erotic, and Charles Highway's arrogance grates on the reader. A few of his ""insights"" like the one about ignoble savages, reserved Italians, etc. were funny, but reading the rest was a trial in patience. This is definately the most oversexed book I've read since ""The Burn"" by Aksenov. At least this book does talk about STDs. Only worth 2 stars"
4,A British Portnoy's Complaint; great fun.,"Matrin Amis is a genius, and this book is his most enjoyable and funny."
4,It's Not A Humorous Story,"I read the reviews of this book thinking that it would be a humorous story -- that's what the reviews said. It's not -- unless you consider what 19-year-old British guys think about is humorous. I don't find funny the things that Charles about. I found it interesting. He is preoccupied with himself, how smart he is, his father and sex. I didn't find that odd at all for someone like Charles. I thought the toughest part of reading this book was remembering not to pass judgment on Charles. Rather, I had to remember that he is a young British guy in the early 1970s. When I kept that in mind, I found the book instructive, rather than entertaining (entertaining in the tv show sense). The writing style is pretty straightforward. So if you enjoy reading for the writing technique, this isn't your book. The main character, though, is worth the effort."
3,The Rachel Papers,"Just read it. I thought the book was alright. Charles just seems like a typical teenager who thinks they know everything there is to know, is a bit disgusting and thinks about sex a lot(and getting it). I also had to the get out the old dictionary as Charles dazzled us with his elevated vocabulary. Despite this he still seemed a bit of a prannet.This was Martin's first book and it seems semi-autobiographical as Charles's father is literary successful and he is also precocious and Oxbridge bound.In last chapter involving Charles getting dissed at the University interview, i think was a bit of a come-uppance for him. Also Charles showed how immature he is by not telling Rachel she could have been potentially pregnant and then dumping her.The character Norman was a bit of a grotesque spiv-like but still believable. Bit strange that he would have hooked up with Jenny his sister though."
3,BookishR,"No really memorable characters, not that's always an issue. But, Amis seems to use this first novel as a showcase for his writing skills. And the book seems to end at what seems no different a point than the end of any of the characters' episodes. Although this could be appropriate in a novel that expresses itself as an ongoing diary, I would've preferred an ending that clearly left room for more in Highway's relationship with Rachel, that left things open for a possible continuation, or possibly Amis could have provided us with an epilogue that either alluded to future events between the two of them or that gave some closure to the relationship. I felt the reader was just left hanging."
1,Olympus J300 Microcassette Recorder,"I have bought this recorder 2 days ago. I have used it only twice and for some unknown reasons it does not work any more.I have paid [quite a lot]. Thus, if you do not want to have trouble do not buy it ! Add few euros and buy yourself something better."
1,Piece of Junk,I have had this recorder for a couple years and have sent it back 5 times because it just decides to not work. Customer service is horrible and the new recorders they send me are just as bad and stop working (without explanation) again. A waste of time and money.
1,Don't bother,"I have owned three of these ""machines"" and each time, they stop working after lessthatn a week for no reason. I wish I could post no stars.Don't But it.Never buy it.You're beter off throwing your money out the window."
1,Fell Apart After Little Use,I purchased this recorder in 2003 and barely used it. I dropped it once and it completely fell apart making it useless. I would expect a hand held device to be able to absorb normal impact and wear and tear but this recorder was rendered useless after a minor accident - it slipped from my hand and landed on my desk.The only reason I am re-visiting this page is to make certain of the product name and model so I do not buy it (or any other cassette recorder in this series) again.A truly poor product.
1,Terrible!!!,I had the recorder exactly 31 days before it stopped working entirely... I would NEVER have bought this item had I read these reviews first. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
2,Short lived delight,"I have the Vacu Vin marinator and love it, so I bought the coffee saver thinking it would be just as good. It worked initially, but after three weeks of infrequent use I am quite disenchanted! The seal does not hold; I pump out the air and within an hour the air is back again. I'll still use it as a canister, but I would not buy any more. (I still love the marinator though...)"
3,Buy Vacuum Food Saver Instead,"This has a 0.75 Liter (Vacu-Vin is based in the Netherlands) capacity. The Vaccuum food saver comes with a 1.0 Liter, 0.75 Liter, and 0.5 Liter jar with pump. The Vacuum Food Saver lid is white. The Vacuum marinator (multi dish) is 1.25 Liter capacity. The Concerto stoppers also work with the Vacuum coffee saver, the Concerto vacuum pump is easier to use and won't accidently crack the container by pumping too much. The interior is 5 inches long with a 4 inch diameter. While I haven't tried it as a marinator, my guess is that it would hold about a 1-1/2 pound circular Boston roast. The Concerto pump won't work very well with the regular pump stoppers, so if you buy the Concerto pump, buy (extra) Concerto stoppers."
2,"Great concept, but I'm having trouble with it.","I have used the wine bottle system successfully for several years and love it. So, I bought the marinade and coffee systems along with an extra canister for sugar. Despite trying different stoppers and different degrees of vacuum (pumps), the coffee and sugar canister lids are always loose the next time I use it (a 24 hour interval or longer). The seals are in place and seem fine. Any help would be appreciated."
1,"Lousy, threw mine out","I love their wine saver product, and use that all the time; what a great gadget! And I drink a lot more coffee than wine, and am at least as sensitive to the quality, so this sounded pretty promising. Unfortunately, I found it didn't work worth a darn. I was never able to get it to hold a seal satisfactorily, and so the whole effort of using this became a waste. Almost any container (ziploc, tupperware, mason jar, etc.) would be better. Sorry to say that, because the idea has promise and I like their other product quite a bit. I would recommend not getting this, based on my experience."
4,great purchase,this canister really keeps the air out which means coffee stays fresh! But remember do not keep in the refrigerator or else the seal becomes broken...I only wish this company would make different sizes and I would buy them all!
5,Really Keeps Beans Fresh,"This container really keeps my beans fresh. Just keep it in a cool dry, dark place and enjoy fresh coffee!"
1,Educated,"The premise was intriguing, with an interesting list of subjects to draw a prospecgive viewer into the sale. However, the details are minimally researched, shallow to say the least. Anyone who knows the subject areas is ""turned off"" immediately. If possible, no stars would be given."
1,Speculative distortion,"This is all stuff you didn't know because all lot of it is stuff is no one knows but the make-believe artists making it up. I've read many books about Hitler and I can tell you that all of the ""facts"" in the disc on Hitler are half-truth speculations! Hitler feared something about his past but a potential Jewish grandfather has pretty much been ruled out- a history of mental illness is more likely. Hitler was a bit weird with women but all the psycho-sexual analysis he's been subjected to still leaves his actual physical relationships with them a mystery. He was probably no weirder than many of OUR politicians today! This series is classic propagandistic distortion- it encourages stupidity instead of curiosity. Don't be fooled- you may not know- BUT NEITHER DO THESE CLOWNS!"
1,10 idiotic things you didn't know about JFK,A waste of time and $. Don't fall for this one. I didn't mind the waste of $1.99 as much as I resented the waste of time. =(
2,:(,"was disappointed with this video, i usually love getting history channel DVD's but man, this one was really just lame. i got bored watching, and so did my boyfriend .. we ended up making fun of it.wish i would have spent my money on something else!"
4,SYNOPSIS-DUTCH COMFORT WOMAN OF THE WW2 JAPANESE,"50 years of SILENCEBy Jan Ruff O'Hearne""The long idyllic summer of Jan Ruff-O'Herne's childhood in Dutch colonial Indonesia ended in 1942 with the Japanese invasion of Java. She was interned in Ambarawa Prison Camp, along with her mother and two younger sisters. In February 1944, when Jan was 21, her life was torn apart. Along with nine other young women, all of them virgins, she was plucked from the camp and her family, and enslaved into prostitution by the Japanese Imperial Army.Her searing account of her time in ""the House of the Seven Seas"" the Japanese Officers club and brothel in Semarang , uncovers one of the worst human-rights abuses to come out of thr war-abuse that affected thousands of young women who were forcibly removed from their families to provide sexual services as 'comfort women' for the Japanese army between 1929 and 1945'50 years of silence' is Jan's story."
2,overrated.,"being intrigued by the crazy prices this cd goes for on Amazon and Ebay... i became determined to find a cheaper copy elsewhere. i discovered that Mindwave (r.i.p. jacky boy) had a copy for $18, so i snatched it up w/ greedy hands. to my dismay... this one is kind of poopy. i consider this cd to probobly be the worst of the manson bunch (along w/ the 555 copy LP Poor Ol Prisoner Boy, which is basically the same as this but with a different song order), the sound quality is terrible and the songs aren't that nifty either. you can tell that charlie was kind of indifferent while he was recording this, almost like he was just doing it to do someone a favor. but... there are a few nice moments, but i definately would pay $130, or whatever the hell Amazon is asking for it. to save money, just get stoned amd keep flushing your toilet while people in the backround have droning conversations."
2,"Defective, mis-labled cards","I ordered two of these new cards from 'Quick Buys' and one was defective out of the box. No problem. I contacted them and they quickly sent a replacement. However, the replacement too appears to be defective. Playing ""Knockout Kings 2001"" I saved a custom boxer, but when I came back later to load that save there was nothing there. Oddly, the card now claims it's full, and won't even try to save anything, even though there's no data there. If I use the Playstation's memory management system it will show the bad card is empty and allow me to copy data from one good card to the bad card, but another check shows the bad card empty again.Also, although these cards are listed as ""Performance"" brand cards, the new cards I received from 'Quick Buys' are ""Komodo"" brand. I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but I also ordered 3 ""Komodo"" cards after the issues with the first ""Performance"" cards. Those 3 ""Komodo"" cards have yet to exhibit any problems.Thank you,Slaughter"
1,Doesn't work on PS2,It doesn't look like the card in the picture and I had some trouble at first. It went away for a little bit but it kept asking to be formatted (which I did) but it always erased everything. Do not buy this for a ps2 slim. Hunt down an official one.
3,Old English Roses 'Made in Indonesia',"Sorry to say I was disappointed in the Quality of the China. It was advertised as ""boxed"". It arrived in a kind of flimsy looking box (like from the 99c Store). The cup and saucer were manufactured in Insonesia and simply do not look as good as a I thought they would. Even though the design (the old country roses) seems to be true to the original pattern, frankly it looks cheap. I also bought a ""Tea Set"" which was manufactured in China and frankly it looks much richer and better quality. So the question is, when you order Royal Albert Old Country Roses Dinnerware, how do you know ahead of time if it was made in Indonesia or in China.Again the stuff made in China(the 3 Piece Tea Set) is better quality and looks better."
3,"Nice quality, but very small","This mat is made of recycled rubber, nice quality, but be warned it's very small. Two standard ceramic bowls from PetsMart would not even fit on it together. Would definitely keep it if it was larger, but this is for small dogs only."
5,Love it!,I bought this for my mother in law and it's working very well. It is well made and is easy for her to use.
2,THE BLOODY BROOD - PETER FALK,WHERE'S THE CLOSED CAPTION (CC)OR SUBTITLED FOR THE DEAF & THE HARD OF HEARING (SDH)?
4,Princes and towers,"The Reluctant Queen is my intro to Jean Plaidy, whom I've been meaning to check out for a long time. Though a bit overlong, this novel is unique to my experience in presenting the life of Richard III in positive light, for a change. His story is told in the first person by the character of his wife, Anne Neville, who is a victim of the plots and machinations of Warwick The Kingmaker, her father, and then of various other nefarious relatives, male and female. This is a colorful story, well told, and a fun, painless way to learn something more about those complicated Wars of the Roses. Recommended for lovers of English history and semi-fictionalized adventure. I'll certainly be trying out more of Plaidy's epics."
5,"Spirit of the northern wilderness, updated with a live table of contents","This is a storehouse of 34 of Robert Service's best poems of the Yukon and the lure of the lone trail. There's now a table of contents with live links to each of the poems. It's all here: the vastness, loneliness and beauty of the Yukon; the intensity of image and feeling of ""The Shooting of Dan McGrew;"" the unforgettable first stanza, storytelling and suprise of ""The Cremation of Sam McGee.""""Sam McGee"" and ""Dan MgGrew"" made big impressions on me when we read them in high school. I've since spent many months in mountain wilderness and gotten to know miners in the California desert. In Robert Service I sense a kindred soul."
2,Somewhere between bland and annoying.,"When I bought this CD, I had never actually listened to Dropline's music. I was going off of reccommendations from Amazon (how weird...), a friend, and a music club. Let's just say I learned my lesson. I still think the music club was a good idea, but I ended up with at least one CD I regret: Dropline's You Are Here.Frankly, their music is bland, stereotypical rock at best. I didn't hear anything interesting, exciting, or particularly original. It doesn't have to be perfect, but come on - I basically forgot about the CD as soon as I listened to it. On the other hand, the lead singer's vocals are just plain annoying. They get on my nerves! After a while, I can feel a headache coming on.Bland music + annoying vocals = bad CD!They say music clubs dupe you into buying CDs you never wanted. Well, I chose this one voluntarily. On the other hand, I never truly wanted it, and now I'm planning on getting rid of it! I would advise you not to make the same mistake I did."
4,"At 6pm, the angels are up. It's realistic.",The first reviewer was the most tasteless and obscene I have ever seen. We reviewed the movie in school as part of Intercultural studies. The story must be based on real events because I have seen many of those cases. It depicted prostitution as a means to make both ends meet. The plot was laid out realistically.
3,Depressing Exotica.,"It's erotic, it's sexual, it's violent and ultimately depressing.It's the classic tale of prostitution stealing one's soul in the end--Filipeno style. Three brothers choose to work in a gay bar as male prostitues. They find this is the best way to make a quick buck. Everyone in the family knows about it.Mom , dad, one of the boy's is married with a wife and kid and she knows about it. And she is fine. She even meets his male lover with open arms. How amazingly accepting to their circumstances.There is a lot of heartbreak in this movie. The actress playing the mother is wonderful and your heart goes out to her. Much more said would give to much away.There is a great display of Asian Beefcake-- but since the message is one of prostitution ruining one's life and soul --the erotica goes out the window. Still an interesting honest portrayal of desperate people and male prostitution in the Phillipines."
3,"Not so bad, but not that good either","It is an exploitation vehicle but rises above the treacle to make you see how morality becomes an impossibility in a deeply-rotten society.Stark and gripping,it details the plight of three brothers who became strip dancers for gay bar. It is graphic in its depiction of a society already on the throes of a breakdown -of people desperately clinging for the little shred of hope that remains - of doing what they can to survive. But there are also tender moments that redeem the characters from the hell they find themselves in."
5,thanks-A+,thanks a lot for your help and intructions. I got the game to work great and it is very fun. Thanks-A++++
5,Is This Complete and Uncut?,"It was distressing to learn that the DVD version of I CLAUDIUS, even remastered, has been cut, with important scenes missing. What is the status of this VHS release? Do we see Caligula's horse become a senator, or not?"
4,Awesome book for an autograph collector,"I purchased this book for my husband who collects autographs, mostly through the mail now that we don't live in LA. He loves it! He uses the book on a regular basis to write to sports figures, politicians and actors/actresses. So far we have had good luck with the addresses listed."
3,why did i have to buy this seperately?,This should have been included in the therma rest pad i bought a while back. Instead i had to fork out an extra $10....
1,Broke the first day I used it. Do not buy!,"Within 15 minutes of getting into the pool, the thing broke in half. Do not buy this. They also include an instructional VHS tape. They forgot to include the player to watch the video. Who has one of those anymore? It would be really easy to put the video on a CD or a DVD."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the first book, Scandalous, I was excited to read the sequel. However, the story line really annoyed. I wanted to read a romance, but I did not feel the connection between the characters. There seem to be a bigger connection between Simone and Chad, but in the end, he ended up with Samantha. Don't get me wrong, I wanted Samantha to find her love, but I felt that Chad was stringing Samantha along. I still cannot fathom how they are suppose to be family, but Simone did not inform Samantha that she slept with Chad. Ugh!"
1,Reallly!!!!!!!,I enjoyed reading the previous book and was reallllly disappointed with this one!!!! How the story unfolded was unbelievable. I get that these sisters were not related by blood but how did the author come up with this plot. Weird!!!
1,Terrible,DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK AT ALL.THE STORY LINE WAS NOT ROMANTIC IN ANYWAY.HOW DARE HE GET INVOLVED WITH BOTH SISTERS.I WANTED CHAD TO REALIZE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO BE WITH SIMONE.NOT REALISTIC AT ALL!TERRIBLE BOOK
2,Disappointed,After reading Scandalous I was looking forward to this book. This is just boring and nasty. Simone should have been a woman and told Chad what she wanted and stop acting like a teenager. Even if Chad felt Simone was no longer interested he should have told Sam that he was not interested he had dated her sister and found someone that was not family. How can you date your sisters any way didn't he have a connection with both of these ladies because of there dad. Justin said he was like a son and you date his daughter and step daughter no morals.
1,Don' Buy IT,"The book is full of errors. It is hard to follow, even harder to reference to during the Exam. There is nearly not enough information to got a decent overview of some of the more difficult material. It was a complete waste of money for me.I recommend the Lindeburg book."
2,Errors,I just bought it. I opened up on page 101 to find the Dr(%) formula (5.10) being wrong. This does not give me a warm feeling. I probably will be further disappointed with this book. I'll tell you more about it later.
1,Errors galore!,"I have only been through half of the text portion of the book and am extremely disappointed and appalled at the number of errors found in the sample problems. Whether the errors are typos or computational, I don't think anyone can or should trust that what they try to review. Do not waste your money in buying this book."
3,decent but mediocre,"I have been an S.O.D. fan since 1987 and for those of us who didn't get a chance to catch ""Live at Budokan"" VHS this is a real treat. The first part of the DVD is fine,it's the bonus material that's lame. First, you have to learn a code,(which is 485799 for anyone who needs it)then you rush to put it in thinking, ""Alright bonus S.O.D.!"" only to find out it's the same concert on the first half of the DVD only unedited. To top that I found no picture gallery either, The concert just repeats itself at the end of every viewing. If you're looking to find a bunch of extra material you won't find it here.You're better off just saving a few bucks and buying the video."
5,Great Book!,"I was not sure what to expect when I first started ""The Morning Gift,"" and the book pleasantly surprised me. An engaging depiction of a fascinating time and just as engaging main character. I think it is more in line with ""Cecilia Holland's"" books, than ""Diana Norman's.""I recommend."
1,a major disappointment,"Although I am glad to have information about the interesting buildings that this book describes, the new edition is little better than a bad Xerox copy. The text is clear but the photographs are very badly reproduced. In many cases one cannot see the architectural details which are being described in the text. The bad photocopies of the illustrations defeat the purpose of a facsimile edition and make this book a disappointment that I would not recommend buying."
3,Political cartoons on the Comics Page,"This volume was printed posthumously by Selby Kelly and contains a collection of the more politically-charged sequences from Walt Kelly's 1970, '71, and '72 Pogo strip. By this point Kelly's intricate inking has reached its climax, with stunning swamp panoramas in the backgrounds of what I personally find to be somewhat overly-serious comic foregrounds. I personally find that by this period Kelly's humor and charm were fading, a trend aggravated in this collection by selecting for political satire instead of comic entertainment. Even so it is not without Pogo's typical intricate goofiness and did earn a few solid laughs."
3,Impossible to install,"I bought this thing twice (once for my treo, once for my Ipod)... and each time, no matter how careful I was, I wasn't able to get this thing installed without some sort of dirt getting under it... If you do get something under it, LEAVE IT, because if you try to remove it, you'll get finger print marks on the sticky side, making it even worse.If you are, some how, able to install these correctly, they work great."
4,Jay Leno - before the Tonight Show,"This video brought back a lot of memories for me (I was a teenager in the '80's).The quality of the video sent to me was very good. Good price, too.A fine first experience at Amazon for me!"
3,American Dream YOU ARE DREAMING!,I love Jay so to watch him when he was in his 30's was fun...it is not intellectual comedy but still fun overall...
5,Get this DVD plus 'To Hell And Back',"Many times in my life I have felt the need to describe a real war hero. Usually Audie Murphy is my example. With the two DVD's (This one and the movie, 'To Hell And Back') I no longer have to just describe the actions of a true hero, now I can pop the DVD in and let 'em watch!"
1,Defective,"Sounds like I got a canister like someone below. Mine won't hold the seal for longer than a minute or two. Completely useless. So cheap though, not worth returning. But already in the trash. Sure if mine wasn't defective- it would do the job. Pumping is no big deal and easy."
3,"Seems to keep a vacuum - I rate it as ""okay""","The vacuum is created by using a separate pump, and it is difficult to know if one has pumped sufficiently. Then there is the question of where to keep the pump device. I found the container a bit smaller than I needed to store my coffee beans, and space consuming, considering the need to keep the pump device handy."
3,Some concerns,"I almost bought one of these and then I asked the author of a number of books on coffee what he thought. He said he and his colleagues don't use them because 1) the vacuum action sucks oils and flavors out of the beans during each pump but 2) if you don't pump a lot, you're removing so little oxygen it doesn't make any difference. He noted that Illy and other non-Folgers type coffee bean dealers don't vacuum pack, they pack the beans in CO2 or Nitrogen (I think) gas, so that there's no oxygen, but the beans aren't being sucked dry of their oils and flavors. I think these canisters would be useful for creating a seal, but I wouldn't use them for really creating vacuum."
3,Effort Required--Is It Worth It?,"Bought this item a few months ago and have now figured out exactly how to use it. Instructions were not good. To ensure things are properly stored, one must exercise elbow grease and pump,Pump, PUMP! Not a simple, easy container to use, requires work and cleaning every time it is opened, but it does store things as described. Not sure it is worth so much effort. Opening it up is also time consuming, one must pinch the top just exactly right."
4,HOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE POUND?,"Works great and you get dual use out of the pump you bought for saving wine. But the marketing and product development crew were sleeping when they sized this thing. The canister doen't even come close to holding a pound of unground coffee, the standard size in which most coffee is packaged."
1,"Product is Junk, Save your money.",I bought the starter kit and 2 extra contaniers. They are JUNK and DO NOT hold a seal for more than 5 minutes. Save your money.
4,Lots of fun for little $,"To be honest, I didn't expect much for the price. I bought the pocket trumpet for the novelty of it. It is fun to play and once you make some minor adjustments to your playing the sound is pretty good. This is an excellent practice instrument, especially if you're maintaining the finish of your regular trumpet. I found that using a 1.5C mouthpiece really improves the tone."
1,sticky valve manufacturing defect. trumpet useless,manufacturer stalled with email until 14 days expired where i could not return this item. worst customer service ever!
3,Not good for shooting,I bought these to use while target shooting . I thought they wouldbe more comfortable than the typical ear muff type. I couldnot get them to stay in my ears and when they were in thegun fire was still very loud. Back to the mouse ears!
1,"Starts off Fine, but....","Starfire is a futuristic romance novel about Dez Sanchez a disgraced pilot and his love for a mysterious woman named ""Rebel"" who he believes is a gardener. While I initially found this novel interesting I found Dez too mature for the 21 year old Rebel. There was also an ick factor for me when Rebel's true identity was revealed. I felt Rebel showed a blistering lack of maturity (no surprise given her age).I gave up on this book. I found I disliked the heroine and lost respect for her by page 50."
5,We could all learn a lot from reading this book.,This book needs to be read by everyone. We enjoyed this book and plan to discuss it in detail with our grandchildren. It has advice on life that we should use in everyday living. It is a treasure. Jean and Gary Somsen
3,mastercook,"Mastercook is a great program, except for the import tool, apparently this program is not supported by Vista, and every time I try to import a recipe the program closes on me."
1,Unable to complete the setup,"I was not able to install the product under Windows XP. Maybe the product is good, I will never know."
1,Poor Quality,"I have tried the halos glasses, which are very good in durability and quality of the frame.however, lens are scratch prone which soon will cancel your purchase"
2,Want the REAL Source? Read the Secret Source!,"While this film has disappointed many, I appreciate it's ability to expand on the current Secret discussion. However, if you really want to know more about the Source of the Secret, begin by learning about how the Secret Teachings have been passed down throughout history.A truly excellent book is 'The Secret Source' by Maja D'aoust and Adam Parfrey. In it the authors lay out a brief (but concise) history of the Hermetic Laws within contemporary Europe and America. This books give an excellent overview of the Teachings as experienced through authors, philosophers and spiritualists. I especially enjoyed learning about the Kybalion and William Atkinson.For those looking for more, give this a read. Not only is it simple and enjoyable, but it also highly concentrated and can lead an open reader to powerful discoveries. Enjoy!http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Source-Attraction-Ancient-Hermetic/dp/1934170070/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1238638510&sr;=8-1"
2,What the HECK???,"I also thought it was more of The Secret, but the purpose of THIS DVD is to launch into scripture as a way of disproving the Secret.I was totally disappointed."
1,Not what I thought.,"By the packaging of this I thought it had to do with ""The Secret"" and I was hoping to further my learning there. Not so, while there is some good information, I felt like they were saying ""...but don't forget about God."" That is not what I was aiming at, and I think the issue I have here is that the marketing is misleading."
1,TELL ME HOW.................................,"TELL ME HOW AMAZON LET THIS GUY PUT HIS ALBUM ON THIS WEBSITE. IT MUST BE ONE OF THOSE FREE WEBSITES LIKE EBAY. TELL ME HOW I BROUGHT THE ALBUM (LIKE A DUMMY) AND COULD'NT BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING. I WOULD COMPARE THIS ALBUM TO A SHAQ CD. (YES EVERYONE, SHAQ FROM THE LAKERS) I GUESS HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE OVER THE RAP GAME SINCE HOVA LEFT BUT THE ONLY THING HE DID WAS PUT IT TO SHAME. I RATE THIS ALBUM A -5 (NEGATIVE FIVE)"
1,Why did I even bother,I purchased C-Fury album a couple of days ago. What was I thinking? Who ever heard of a rapper rapping slow. This cd sounds like he made it right out of his bedroom. Hopefully anyone who reads this will think twice about purchasing a C-Fury cd.C-Fury who?
5,to my papi,"i want to commend a man who is tryin his hardest to take his career to a next level , and he doin it from the city he is from he is keepin it real , and showin his deciation to his work by makin his dream as a producer happen , c. fury is a new kind of producer in my eyes , i wish him the best , and all of my support...i wish u lots of luck papi"
1,save your money and time,"I was never able to get the ""signing"" feature on this software to even work. There is some software problem with having the exact sound card and such in order to be able to use this signing software. I have a new computer and it wouldn't even work on it! I wasted my money b/c I haven't even been able to use it."
2,Not as expected,"I expected a lot more than the program delivered. My 5 year old daughter is computer savvy and I still had to sit with her and figure out how to move around in the CD. It also lacked words such as hello, hi, good-bye and friend. Those are words that should be included in any Kids Sign Language program."
5,All hail Margery Kemp!,"Is there a good book that is not, in some fundamental way, odd? This book is odd, and it is brilliant, and if you're a little odd yourself, it will do you rapturous good to read it. I've hesitated too long to take the plunge... Don't make the same mistake. Read this book now!"
5,Not an ordinary black watch,"I've had this watch for over 3 years now, and have been wearing it everyday. I must say it looks new as the day I got it. The combination of gray to black color thoughout the watch, makes for an attractive, but not flashy, everyday wear effect.It tells good time with an annual deviation of 15-20 minutes. Well, it's an automatic watch. Get a quartz, if you want a more accurate time-piece. What's a few minutes difference, as compared to not having the time because of dead battery.Looking forward to more years of wearing this not so ordinary black watch."
5,A Keeper,"It's been over 30 years since I first read this book. It was presented then as part of a horse-lovers book-club for young readers, and I recall being a bit disappointed with it on first acquaintance. Though horses feature on every page of the story, it wasn't a stereotypical 'horse story.' Now I recognize that lack as an asset! This story has gained power over the years, and now very simple sentences serve to open the heart to the mysteries of the universe, love and life and longing, and certainly plenty of tears. Not necessarily for little kids who just want to read about ponies, though."
5,Smoooooooth Jazzzzz... sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet,Love the selections on this CD. They flow very well creating a relaxing candlelight atmosphere to share with a special one. Highly recommended!
2,Are we looking at the same book?,"Many of Ansel Adams' exquisite photographs call out for large reproductions, and this book displays them in a decent size format. But what a waste. The reproductions are nearly all flat and murky, with little detail in the shadow. If I had read far enough down into the customer reviews, I would have been warned; but the reviews at the top of the stack were quite favorable. Which leads me to wonder: Are we looking at the same book? I advise readers to purchase Adams books published by Little, Brown, and Company (aka ""Bulfinch""). Even at smaller sizes their books display much more detail and clarity than does this disappointing edition."
1,Adams wouldn't have approved,"While some photos are reasonable, most are seriously flawed. Some are flat, some are excessively contrasty, others seem murky and indistinct. Some of the photos need cleaning to remove dust spots, etc. Even the title is wrong , as the book includes photos of dams and sheep. There are many other excellent books, which have been prepared from Adams prints and produced with much more care. Buy one of those."
1,"Awful printing quality bad shadow detail, poor sharpness","Terrible printing quality of photos that are obscure because they're not that good. Whether the lack of sharpness in these is down to the paper, the printer, or the photographer (yes, even Ansel took crap at times, and people seem determined to publish everything he ever did, however bad!), I don't know, but the lack of sharpness and the awful shadow detail make this book an absolute waste of time. Maybe it will impress a non-photographer (simply so they can boast having a book of Adams's shots) - but a photographer is wasting their money."
5,wonderful book,This is a great used book in good condition at a reasonable price. Speedy shipping. The book arrived before I expected to receive it.
5,American Photography at its Best,Breathtaking photos. Especially in light of the rudimentary equipment available at the time they were taken. Proves that Ansel Adams is still unsurpassed in American photography. Captures the majesty and beauty of the vanishing American wilderness. Members of Congress should view this work before voting to open refuge or wild lands to drilling and logging.
4,Book delivered in even better conditions than expected,"I'm very glad with this purchase since the book arrived in very good conditions, much better than I thought it would be. Service was prompt and didn't have any problems with the store; I only wish that I would have had a tracking # for my order, so that I may have monitored the shipment until its arrival. Other than that I'm very pleased with my purchase and would definitely do business with them again."
4,Solid folk metal,"I generally have mixed feelings about folk metal. On the one hand, I appreciate the melancholic and dark folk-tinged metal stylings of Primordial, Drudkh, or even Agalloch. I also like the more energetic folky metal of old Amorphis. But the boppy polka metal of Finntroll and others leaves me cold. Tyr, however, while being closer to Finntroll than Primordial, are not only listenable but enjoyable. First of all, it's fun that half their lyrics are in Faeroese. Second, I like that their song structures are a bit more complex than your standard folk metal band. And third, I like the sung vocald and solid musicianship. Sure, the CD gets a little same-y after a while, but it does contain some great songs (the first track especially is addictive) and is a worthwhile purchase for anybody into this subgenre of metal."
1,Bad pressing by cd maker,"I love TYR so much I would tattoo them on my butt.I do NOT love the company that pressed this cd. It's all dolled up as Eric The Red, but in reality it was How Far To Asgard. Not amused. Will pass it on to my cousin."
1,These do not make a tight seal. Don't buy unless you have a pump!,"I thought these would work like a cork only better. They don't. From what I've read, you should not use these unless you also have ""the pump"". The directions on the package and on the web site indicate you can use these by themselves. However, the directions are not very precise or clear. I cannot get them to stay in the bottle, to ""pump"" or make any type of seal. They just sit on top of the bottle. In fact, when I try to push them down into the bottle, they slide right back up! What a waste of money."
4,These work fine...,Bought these after one or two of the originals disappeared over the years. They last for a long time and seem to do their job...
1,Terrible product!,"I bought 12 of these and they are terrible. The original ones I have are grey, these are cheap black material and the simply DO NOT work! The only reason I don't return them is because I live in Venezuela and shipping them back would cost a bundle."
5,high quality,we are avid wine drinkers but can't seem to keep track of our wine stoppers. very happy with this product it works with our other Vacu Vin pump (older model).
3,STOP! ... these stoppers do not work well with older VacuVin pumps!,"If, like I, you purchased a VacuVin pump several years ago and want to replace the stoppers you have lost, these replacements do NOT seem to work as well as the older ones. They don't resemble the older stoppers, so caveat emptor, although the older pumps resemble the newer ones imaged at the Amazon URL.The newer corks come in two parts separated by a plastic rim, and break down presumeably for washing: clearly a plus! When tested, however, the upper, nippled head did not fit tightly with the older pump. With a bit of effort, however, the older pump produced a reasonable seal, and breaking the seal produced a similar satisfying ""pop"" when the cork was removed.Whether wine resealed in this manner tastes as good as when stored with the older pump/stoppers remains to be seen. The buyer might be better off buying the both the newer pump and newer seals, and throwing away the older pump, in the American Way!"
5,Vacu Vin Wine Savers do Save the Wine,"I've tried everything else. This is the only way to keep a bottle of wine from going bad. Unless the weather is extremely warm, it will last for several days after opening it. I love this product."
4,Great,Always need extras with multiple bottles of wine open. Helps keep flavor of wine for a week easily. Works with both pumps we have.
1,They sent cheap knockoffs of the real product,I got scammed by ordering these--instead of sending the actual stoppers they sent cheap duplicates that were too big and poorly made. Don't order from amazon.
2,Vacuvin products are getting worse,"These stoppers require that you hold the pump more perpendicular above the stopper and then hold the seal more firmly. They aren't as forgiving as the old stoppers for when you hold it at a slight angle. Its frustrating when technology moves backwards, and then they call it progress. This company used to have a better product line with their containers as well. However, this product might still be better than the practically non-existent alternatives. This product deserves three stars, but I'm giving it two stars because so many of the other reviews are skewed way too high."
2,shady packaging,"I ordered these recently and when they arrived they were in a small, plastic ziploc-like bag with a simple label on it. They were slightly gritty too. I would not order again."
2,Bring back the original design.,"Please, Vacu Vin, won't you bring back the old design?! Those slightly softer ones with the slit on the top and three ridges on the bottom? The ones that don't, on occasion, slip up in the bottle, leaving wine oxidized -- the ones that don't fall out in transit, spoiling a cooler's content with spilt wine? I have a couple of the old ones left and am guarding them with great care, so as not to lose one of these precious, quality stoppers. Won't you please make these again? You could even call them ""deluxe"" and sell them for 50% more. One bottle of spilt or stale wine would make it worth a return to quality -- and I have had three such disappointment with this design."
1,Bait & Switched??,Tried these extra stoppers in several different bottles. They will NOT work. Some won't completely allow air evacuation; others will not hold a vacuum for any length of time.... Received black stoppers although the original ones and the Amazon picture of the stoppers were gray. The black ones are not as soft & pliable as the originals. Seems I didn't receive what I ordered but some inferior knock-off.Buyers BEWARE!!!
1,Simply don't work,"I have 960 bottles at last count and these simply don't seal. My Mechanical Engineer friends looked at the diameters, stiffness of rubber - making it want to retain the rubber's inserted dimensions. Pumping handle resistance at maximum, the top popped up on its own!"
1,Garbage,These are absolutely worthless. They will not stay in the wine bottle at all. I completely regret this purchase. Do not purchase this.
2,stoppers,I found that this type stopper did not hold bottle of wine air tight after 2 days. I am comparing this against the old type stopper before the upgrade.
1,Don't be fooled by the good overall rating,PLEASE READ THE REVIEWSMost of the better ratings are based on OLD reviews.The NEW stoppers simply don't work.Too bad because there is indeed a sizable market that is willing to pay for a quality product.Bean-counters be damned.
4,Stopper for stopper,"These wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job. since you get four, you can have four bottles of wine open at the same time."
2,Unreliable--old style much better,"I used the old style for many years with satisfaction. They did the job. These replacement corks are rigid, tend to slide up out of the bottle before I can apply the pump. Why fix it if it ain't broke? Like another reviewer, I wish the old style were still available."
4,"Decent product, lame package","I've used these wine stoppers before with the VacuVin pump and they work great. I just purchased a replacement set as a gift for a wine lover who already has the pump and asked for some extra stoppers. We thought of packaging these with some other wine accessories in a nice gift box. However, they arrived in only a flimsy plastic bag with a bar code sticker. No label or anything. When purchasing these at a retail store they come in a nice package, which is what I expected here. The stoppers are still functional and for most purposes the packaging is not important. However, if you were planning to use this item as a gift, think twice."
2,Wine stoppers -- not a good deal,"We could not get the stoppers to hold their vaccum. We are going to return them, although the bother is more than the cost."
1,New design does'nt work!!,"I purchased stoppers to increase my supply. I have been using the older grey colored stoppers with ridges and 4 holes and they work great. The photo on Amazon's page shows the older grey stopper. This is not the stopper you will receive. The new stoppers I received are darker black, no ridges and have three holes. They will NOT hold a vacuum and are worthless!! DO NOT buy them!!!"
5,Fresh Wine,"We have been using this system for years. When I was down to my last cork, I looked on Amazon and lucked out. They had the same system I have been using Vacu Vin Wine Saver. I was able to get the saver corks at an affordable price. Thanks."
5,Great for wine lovers,These wine stoppers are wonderful!Wine is kept fresh so you can enjoy your wine over a longer period of time.
3,Extra Wine Corks,"I had the stainless steel wine saver and it did not work, but these do pretty well without having to use that."
5,These work great and last for years if your don't lose them,"I don't drink and my wife likes a glass of wine with dinner (good wine, the kind you only get in bottles).So we cork the bottles with VacuVinThe wine keeps and it just works. We've used them for years. Just don't lose them. If/When you do, buy these replacements.Outstanding. They're paid for in the first couple weeks of use."
3,Ron Berg,"WHY is the great RON BERG only in this movie for 10 minutes?? I mean... Tiffany Shepis is a hottie and all, but RON BERG is THE up-and-coming ""IT"" boy!! Wake up people. (ok I didn't watch this movie yet, I'm only gonna watch it for RON BERG)"
1,TOTAL CRAP,"DON,T WASTE YOUR MONEY- THE COVER LOOKS INTERESTING - THE FILM - IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT IS RUBBISH - I THRU MINE IN THE BIN ALONG WITH EARTH DAY - BOTH A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY & MUST OF BEEN SHOT FROM SOME CLOWN THAT OWNED A HOME VIDEO CAMERA , IT BROKE MY HEART THAT I HAD TO GIVE IT ONE STAR WHICH IS TO MUCH FOR SUCH CRAP."
5,Great action - Scary premise,"Saw this movie at a festival a while back and I'm glad it's finally getting a release on DVD. If you're a fan of indie horror, you should check this movie out. It doesn't hurt that Tiffany Shepis is in it too...she's really great."
1,Not happy with this product,"Bottom Line: This is a crap product. Components are all plastic and can be made to fit all of the valves as advertised. However, once assembled the tiny setscrew that holds the handle on does a poor job of staying put. This will wiggle loose in short order and fall apart. This product is an absolute waste of time and money. One star only because you can't give zero.I purchased this product from a large chain home improvement store and not the Amazon seller, so this is no reflection upon them. I though I would save myself some time by having the trim kit in hand instead of waiting for an online order to arrive. Short story, no time or money saved."
5,Great item at a great price!,"I've been looking for this size spiked cup for quite some time. None of the Home Depot's, Lowe's or other local hardware stores carried it nor were able to order it. In fact, none of these local stores carried the round version anymore whatsoever, and now only stock the large square version. In order to conserve space in my home I use several adjustable wire racks to each of store my clothes, as an entertainment center, and as bookshelves. Unfortunately these wreak havoc on carpet and not only do these cups help to protect the carpet from the crushing weight, they actually look quite natural and easily blend into the environment. They are of very good quality and a necessity for any utilitarian!"
5,THE Best cologne for pets,For me this is the Best cologne for my pet chihuahuas.i love the baby powder scent!!!
4,List of printers is wrong,"I've been using this ink for a couple weeks so far with no problems. Side by side comparison with prints made from Canon ink shows no visible difference. The only thing to watch out for is that the list of compatible printers is wrong. Look to see what your printer needs (BCI-6, BCI-3e, etc) then pick the ink package that includes those particular cartridges."
1,DOES NOT WORK IF PRINTING PICTURES,"Please do not purchase this product if you plan to print photos. The photos are faded, red, and distorted. I tried cleaning my print head, reinstalling the cartridges and NOTHING worked. I had to throw the entire package away. I was not expecting a miracle, but I at least thought the pictures would be somewhat descent. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't buy these. I own a Canon Pixma MP760."
4,"Works well, good value.","I've used these multipack inks a couple of times in my pixma 4000 with no problems. I have noticed that if you want super quality photos you may want to go with the Canon paper and ink, but otherwise this is a great value & I've had no problems with the cartridges."
2,They leak,"Once installed in my Canon printer, they perform adequately. HOWEVER, when I first open the cartridge package and, specifically, when I twist off the orange plastic piece, the cartridges immediately leak substantially. Because of this, I could not recommend them."
5,"Lasted well, looked good, cheap price","I liked these and just ordered a new set, this printer is picky, but these fit great - the old batch fit like OEM, but the new ones I have to jiggle when in to get working right - but once in they work fine."
3,Leaky tanks,"As others have noted, the tanks are prone to staining you and any surface under them when you twist the top off, so do so gingerly. I have not noticed any damage to the printer, just to my now-slightly-magenta desk. I don't use ink quickly, so I'll go with the genuine Canon cartridges next time."
3,"Okay and cheap, but clogs printers.","The color cartridges seem to have worked okay, but the black ones have clogged my Canon Pixma printer. I have had to run the cleaning program in my printer frequently to be able to keep using the black ink. I've also ended up with ink on my hands, but that's not a bid deal for me."
3,Cheap but not easy.,"The product is cheap enough but you can't load them without getting ink all over your fingers. Plus, they seem to give ink out errors very early before they are out. I have had to clean my print head frequently to keep my printer working."
4,"Good, economical ink","Fast service. exactly as ordered. Inks work well and provide good prints. Colors not quite right for photos, but OK for most other use. Would buy again when I next need more ink. Can't beat the price compared to brand name inks."
1,Don't waste your money.,"""These are pretty much junks. I wanted to save money, but it turns out I wasted even more with these. I used them on i850 like some reviewer said, after several rounds of head alignment and cleaning, the color prints are still awful. I would definitely get the brand products next time."""
2,price good quality bad,I thought the price might be too good to be true. Have used one cyan and one magenta cartridge. Colors are FAR from accurate (horrible!). They do function. But for me that's not enough. It was a calculated risk for me at the price I paid. But I will definitely be buying the Canon branded product from now on.
4,Canon IP3000 Ink cartridges,"I have been using these cartridges in my Canon IP3000 printer for several years. They work well and the price is right compared with the manufacturers products. Shipment after order is prompt, and they arrive well packaged. I can recommend them for routine printing, I have not tried them out for high quality pictures. [Canon Compatible (9) Pack Bci-3ebk/bci-6 (3bci-3ebk / 2 Cyan 2 Magenta 2 Yellow) for Canon Ink Cartridges Black Cyan Magenta Yellow]"
3,Quality only so so,"Price seems attractive so I bought a whole pack, but definitely printing quality is really so so. Also it will dryout fast if u dont use up the cartridge fast enough."
1,Compaq stinks!,"My brand new Compaq computer still isn't working after 8 hours on the phone with customer disservice and two replacement hard drives. Save yourself alot of wasted time, buy any other brand."
1,Icky!,"I love J. Lo's GLOW perfume, so this was a big disapointment. This particular perfume has a very strong, bitter lime scent when first applied, and even after it dries, does not ""wear"" well at all. My daughter detected cocoa and vanilla in it, but for me, the lime/citrus scent is most predominant. I think it would be oppressive on a hot day. I didn't like this scent at all, but it may be suitable for a very young girl -- it seems like a very ""young"" scent. This is of course strictly personal opinion, but frankly the smell of this perfume reminded me of Joy lime-scented dishwashing liquid."
1,Cannot Open CD,"CD-Rom is for Windows 95,98 and ME. I can get other CD's for ME to open in Vista but not this one. Not worth the cost of shipping to send it back for a refund. Be Careful, included info for website help and for customer service is no longer available. Last known update to CD was 2006, this CD is marked 2001."
2,Carol Burnett Video - Sound Problem,Carol Burnett Video - Sound Problem when I attempted to broadcast this into a large room. Lots of static and distortion. Is there a way to fix this?Susan
4,Best Norway Map out there?,"We spent ten days touring around Norway as part of our summer vacation. We also brought along a ""Michelin"" brand map of Norway. The Michelin was almost useless and we quickly put it away and used the Hammond exclusively. It is highly detailed and shows the smaller roads as well as the highways. The road ""numbers"" were easy to find on the map. Tips for renting/driving a car in Norway: rent the car in Hamburg, Germany and take a beautiful 2-day drive through Denmark and Sweden before heading on to Norway. We were in Europe for 28 days; rental car cost in Norway was almost $5,000. Cost by renting in Germany; $1,200. Also, expect to take car ferries to cross fjords ($$), pay for toll roads (in both directions!), and wait at tunnels up to an hour while they are CLEANING them! It was well worth it! An absolutely stunningly beautiful country!"
4,Good DVD,"I agree it could have been better, but anything can be better. You just have to enjoy if you have it at hand. The DVD is well filmed, with very good sound, good closeups of the bands and audience. An eclectic selection of bands that is fun to play when you are with people with differing tastes. You just serve the drinks when Robbie Williams is in the screen."
5,THEY OUT WITH ANOTHER GREAT ALBUM AS ALWAYS!,"YUP! Another great album by los angeles azules. They have the best columbian musica I have ever herd however I like the origonal lead singer better there is a hit song on here that I can not get enough listing to it's (Sueno Con Estar Contigo), yes I did buy this album for 1 song witch sounds dumb but I liked it so much then when I bought it and played it I rated it the full 5 stars and would rate it more if I could it got me dancing the whole way through and when it was finished I played it again over and over infact my mom got so sick of hearing it. but that goes to show how much I loved and used this cd and though it's old I still play it and I intend to keep on playing it forever no matter how old it gets! you want to dance you want to move and groove well boy let me tell you is this the cd for you! so why don't you buy it to it should be in your coleccion don't you think so to hope you like it as much as I do!"
4,A good book,"Overall, this is a pretty good book. The photographs are what make it great. The text is informative, though not very techincal, so if you are looking for a more in-depth book, this may not be what you are looking for. However, for the price it is well worth it."
1,Awful,This movie is awful...I bought it for the classroom and it would not fly in public school because of the religious suffocation throughout.
1,Good recording but did not like performances,"This looks like the recording that was specially done to show-off the qualities of DVD-Audio but will end up as a supermarket or dentist's waiting room favorite. I do not like the performances, they seem lame interpretations of the artworks in the disk."
2,jkjons,"Good hat..no size was listed, so it's too big for my 11 year old. By the time he opened it for his birthday, it was too late to return."
1,Bad Presentation (Paperback),I have no comments to make regarding the contents of the book. However the present edition is actually nothing more than a cheap photocopy with a cover slapped on it. Some of the pages are so badly photocopied that the last lines on some pages are missing.
4,A treat for sure,Good things do come in small packages...this little toy is proof! Highly recommend this for those looking for strong vibrations in a little toy.
3,Rz54G Gigabit Ethernet slow,I purchased the Sony VAIO RZ54G and like the machine for the most part. I noticed that my home network was very slow though. I found that the GIGABIT ETHERNET built into the SOny was configured for 10MB/s (1% of it's max rate). My network only supports 100MB/s so I figured it should easily handle 100MB/S if it can do 10 times that... right? Wrong. I worked with support for two days reconfiguring the system and trying every immaginable option in the ethernet controller. We tried to clean install and even had the mother board replaced but still no more than 10MB/s. I can plug in my old dell or my wife's laptop and connect at 100MB/s no problem. Sony washed their hands and said I can put in an aftermarket ethernet card if I want this work. That is not an acceptable solution in my mind. Not happy with their cutomer dis-service.
1,Watch out for this one!,"My husband and I purchased one of these to do dv recording and to convert to and edit mpeg2 files. Each time we tried to play a video in mpeg2 format - and we tried with multiple files - it REBOOTED THE MACHINE! (XP was set to reboot after a fatal error - but even when this was turned off, we still got a fatal error). After we spent hours and hours on the phone with tech support, trying multiple solutions, they concluded it had a faulty video chipset. Needless to say, we returned the pc immediately and got our $$ back. Doesn't Sony do QA testing on a common format like mpeg2??? All I can say is, I hope not many of these machines came out of the box like this one!"
3,Amazon should state product allergies,Product is excellent except my husband can no longer drink it because the product is made in a facility with shellfish derivatives and he is allergic to shellfish. The product has caused him his allergy. Now the bottle is of no use to him.
3,Forgetful,Ordered this item and they never shipped it until I called them 10 days later. They did give me 5 extra boxes for their error and fortunately I didn't need them immediately but I do use them for my business.
2,The pictures were too small to color.,"The coloring book has small images that are too small to color. Since the pictures were too small, I did not color the images."
5,Great book,"with every picture there is a nice explanation. it covers a lot of topics and pretty in depth. the color coding is set up great and easy. If you've never taken a physiology course and you think its difficult i'd get this, it really helps!"
4,like coloring?,"I think this book is wonderful! Like to color and learn? This book starts at the very beginning of learning the anatomy and physiology of the human body, and coloring each area helps you to be able to identify each area and memorize each part."
2,Didnt use it,"Bought it for a physiology course, but didnt find it that helpful, ended up selling it back on campus, though Im not much of a visual learner."
4,"Great way to learn basics, BUT has mistakes","This coloring book is fantastic if you want to study physiology of the human body without reading pages and pages. After coloring, read the page next to it and you pretty much understand everything you need to know. For details I think it's better to stick to your original physiology book. This coloring book is just perfect if you're just starting on a new subject. After a long day at the university sometimes you don't feel like reading, so this is when this book comes in handy.However, there are several mistakes. For example on page 104 concerning the semicircular canals and the image with the head movements that goes along with it. The information is not correct. So this really can get you confused. But after looking it up online and in my other book the problem was fixed."
4,Coloring in Anatomy Book is a great way to learn!,Coloring in Anatomy Book is a great way to learn! This book is extensive and has very useful information alongside the pictures about structure function and physiology.
4,Physiology coloring book,The Physiology Coloring Book has been very useful in my physiology classes. I use it along with my 12th edition Physiology and Anatomy book. The coloring book seems to simplify the concept of the bodies systems. I am entering the nursing program and use it often.
1,Utter Garbage,"The sample of the track I heard was poorly produced, lacked any artistic credibility, and might have been vaguely amusing, if they had actually used samples from her REAL on-screen nervous breakdown, as opposed to her cheesily re-enacting it in the safety of a recording studio, quite possibly after huffing duct sealant.Ever see someone slip and nearly fall, arms flailing, only to right themselves and look around with a ""Yeah, I meant to do that"" expression on their face? That is this release.Please go back to the tiny, insignificant hick town you came from, Ms. Perrin, and take your vapid, too-dumb-to-be-ironic ""music"" with you."
1,I dont think the wrenches themselves are actually made by GearWrench,"The second I used them the rubber handles slid off. The wrenchs dont adjust easily and they feel cheaply made. I love GearWrench but these are junk! The wrench itself doesnt say gearwrench on them at all, leading me to believe GearWrench just put there rubber handles on some cheap chinese made wrench. Do not buy!"
2,Disappointing,"I think this video probably needed to be 2 hours instead of 1. The coverage of Freud's major contributions/concepts is much too superficial--it also presumes previous knowledge. For example, ""libido"" is mentioned but the video fails to describe what Freud meant by that term. His conceptualization of personality (i.e., the id, ego, and superego) is never mentioned! Some interesting details about Freud's personal life, but the video fails to capture his theories and the controversies surrounding them."
3,it gave a brief synopsis of freud,I thought that the video didn't go into detail of explaning his profound theories.
1,Worthless!!!!,"Do not waste your money on any version of JE Taylors Tolkien books. He hides his ""references"" at the back of the book instead of professionally citing them on the page for the entry you are reading. If you are a Tolkien purist you will find many fictional made up details in this book. Instead buy the book that Christopher Tolkien himself cites...Robert Foster's Complete Guide to Middle Earth. This book is VERY accurate for your Hobbit,LOTR, Simarillion reference needs.If you need a cross-reference for the 12 volumes of the History of Middle Earth buy Christopher Tolkiens Index to the History of Middle Earth. You can buy that at Amazon UK."
2,Only a back-up choice,"Third edition of an encyclopedia whose first two, pre- and post-Silmarillion, versions have been floating around for years. A reliable source but a very poor second choice to Robert Foster's Complete Guide to Middle-earth (less detail, more omissions, few dates, hardly any page references), Tyler's tome now includes entries from Unfinished Tales, 24 years after that book was published. It ignores almost everything else since then, whether it fits into the (illusory) ""final"" legendarium or not. Tyler claims he's dropped his pretence that Middle-earth is real, but entries like that for Orcs, identifying them as the true origin of mythic goblins, show that he hasn't. This new edition is only worth having if a copy drops into your lap."
4,Got the job done,"Bought this to remove screws that retain rotors on '04 Acura TL. They are notoriously difficult to remove. I like the fact there is hand protection for striking with hammer or small sledge. Luckily it comes with 2 of each bit (one long, one short). Went through 2 bits to get the job done. First bit distorted and rounded the head of 3rd of 4th screw removed.Overall satisfied since it allowed me to complete the work but wished the bits were stronger."
2,Other Books Much Better,This book is yet another attempt by a religious person to try to appear open minded and to rely on science. But it exudes all manner of religion language and ideology rendering it much less worth reading than books written by scientists or even scientific journalists. I do not recommend that anyway should waste time with this book.
3,Makes me feel sluggish,"As interesting and informative as the book is, I'm glad it's only about 200 pages (the rest are footnotes), instead of the 600-page book it could have been.One can only absorb so much.That Mr. Bloom, who has suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome since 1988, could write this book makes me feel absolutely sluggish."
5,Bloom does it again,"Taking a stance opposite Darwin, Bloom proposes that rather than individual selection, groups do what is best for groups, not for individuals within groups. He begins at the dawn on life on earth and continues through history giving a plethora of examples of how we and the bacteria at the dawn of time are eerily similar. The simplest way of explaining what Bloom is hypothesizing is that most of a group act within accepted norms but some ""diversity generators"" attempt new things. Most of these things fail, but those that don't are adopted by the group thus causing the group to evolve. Bloom offers a tantalizing different approach to viewing history, evolution, and the world but falls a bit below his accomplishments in The Lucifer Principle. Time may prove Bloom to be as important to the world as Darwin, Newton, and Einstein all were."
3,NOT an easy read...,"I really enjoyed Lucifer Principle, I finished the book quite quickly and found it very accessible, not the case at all with ""Global Brain"". I must confess I am not the most scientifically inclined person out there, a casual observer at best so that is why I am not bashing this book completely. A rather boring read and I just about finished half of it before I put it down for good realizing I wasnt really sure what the past 100 pages were about. This is just to serve as a heads up to people out there expecting the same thing as Lucifer Principle, not the case. Just a heads up. I will eventually finish this book however"
2,Too technical for the layman,"I should start this out by saying Howard Bloom is a genuis, and I am a big fan, but that is what makes this review harder for me to write.Everything that made The Lucifer Principle great makes Global Brain not so great. The Lucifer Principle was entertaining and easy to read. It was a rare book, one that dealt with complex ideas, but not in a way that was above the average joe. This book read like a school textbook, and one that you would read in grad school to boot.Another problem was that this book had no clear cut goals, and those it did seemed to similiar to The Lucifer Principle.Stick with the Lucifer Principle and skip this."
1,"Not worth the money, or the time to read it.",I bought and read this book to keep a commitment to a friend. That's the only reason I didn't trash it after the first couple of chapters.The author appears to have encountered a great many ideas without ever understanding any one of them. A careful reading will reveal that the author's objective is to massage the egos of the rich and famous in order to keep his (bragged about) access to their company. It will also weary your brain with passionately argued self-serving nonsense.I suggest you don't bother.
3,A Patchwork Family,"After two children, Christine and Billy, are orphaned and left in their care, the Malloys do their best to make them part of the family,despite Christine's continued snobbery and rebellion. No one who meets Mercy Malloy comes away unaffected by her gentle faith and kindness. Through hard winters, trials and sorrows, the young woman endures. Even after her dear husband is killed, leaving her pregnant with their first birth child, she is undaunted. Is there room in her heart, then, for a new love?*** In Camelot, Arthur claimed that the phrase ""blood is thicker than water was coined by undeserving relations"". Books like this prove that is true. It's not blood that ties a family together, it's love. The Christian message is clear, but not beaten over the readers' heads. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,I liked it at first,"I really enjoyed A Patchwork Family for the first half, but then I got bogged down with too much scattering of information. I was disappointed to see at the end too many loose ends not tied up. That usually drives me crazy in any novel. Ms Hubbard has talent and a good imagination; lots of creativity. She just needs to tighten up her story line. I know; I too am a writer; I have to critique my own work as well, and I read for research. I will read her again."
1,Too Christian,"I found this difficult to read because of the constant Christian references. I was looking to read a light romance, but the pronounced Christian views kept pulling me out of the story. For a person not of Christian faith I would not recommend this book."
5,Good music beautiful voice,Elissa combines arabic and spanish rhythms together in her songs giving her music a unique new style. I totally recommend this album.
5,ahoy,"great psycho band. the one and only. this is the one to get people. the songs on here will throw it's intesity at you in a stab of psycho agression. if you blast this stuff high in your stereo, there's no need to grow a quiff."
5,a delicate mixture of real life and true romance,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Georgia Bockoven is a writer in need of more discovery, if the fact that this book is out of print is anything to go by.The writing touches more than your emotions...it touches your soul. This book is about the best life has to offer, and the worst. Not many writers can capture both and do so without drowning you in sorrow or forcing a suspension of belief. Bockoven manages the feat admirably.I could say many other things about this book, but I can't think how without revealing details that are far better discovered as you read this wonderful writer's work.Know this, readers. Remember your sense of loss after the death of a loved one? Remember your sense of fulfillment when you found your true love? Remember how you couldn't put down a book because it captured your whole attention, your whole existence even? If not, don't read this book. But if so, get it."
5,LOVE!,I love this show!!! why are none of the other seasons on instant! It's on my bucket list to watch every season!
1,"Bad writing, mediocre acting, and soapy storylines make this one of the worst ever...","I can't believe that a show like this is STILL on the air, but true gems like ""Everwood"" get the axe. This show is probably the cheesiest show ever to air on television.Seriously, what are the writers on??For great television, complete with good writing, good acting, smart storylines, and deep characters, check out shows like ""Veronica Mars"" or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""."
1,Corny show,"This show is soooo stupid. Its unrealistic. For example, in every episode Eric and Annie are always making out. I mean come on, they have been married for what, 30 years and they are like 50 but they are sexually active EVERY night and make-out CONSTANTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It gets so old. Also, the father is the most nosiest person EVERY. And the mother, she babies her ""Children"" and dwells on absolutly EVERYTHING!!!!! The oldest son, Matt needs a straight jacket and definatly needs some solitary confinement with that. Lucy acts like a little baby and neeeeds to grow up. And the twins... my god. They talk soooooooo fricken sloooow. Its like they dont know what they are saying. I HATE 7th HEAVEN should be called 7th HELL."
2,Hello? It's kind of a CHEEZYshow!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This show is very weird the characters are ok but some of them are really bad actors, for instance David Gallager where did he learn to act? And Mrs.Camden jeez la weez she needs help!!! Of course just cause I haven't seen the whole season 1 doesn't mean I haven't seen all of the bad actors that come on the show later. Some actors have got spunk like Jessica Biel/Mary she went on to big and better things in life. The dad also I think is fairly good at acting. But PLEASE..... Beverly Mitchell playing Lucy on the show can not act and has the freakiest smile that'll scare you. Of course I think the first season is really good and I hope it sells a lot."
1,Worst show on television!,My god if I had a family like this I think I would kill myself and I do not like the preacher he is so annoying. Please let this show be off the air no more!
3,Horrendous Shiping,"I haven't gotten this product yet. I just wanted to advise anyone considering to use Amazon.com to purchase this to think twice. Their shipping is very slow, it was supposed to arrive days ago and it still hasn't come. Very frustrating, it's been over a week."
4,farmgirl61,My daughters really enjoyed this tv series.They have been a fan of seventh heaven for a long time.The product was delivered in a timely manner and in good condition.
5,A Joy to Own,"We absolutely love this series so it is so good to be able to see all of a season at your own pace. We'll be collecting the other seasons, too for sure."
5,Best Show Ever,"7th Heaven is by far the BEST family show I have ever seen. From the very first episode, it hits home. REAL people, REAL issues. I own this set and am so happy I do. Season 1 is incredible. It's always emotional and always full of love and laughter and is something the whole family can enjoy. I look forward to owning more seasons. I highly recommend this to all families as good wholesome programming. I gave it 5 stars, but wish I could give it 10 stars."
2,Silly little show.,"7th Heaven is one of those shows you love to hate. I couldn't stand this show but I kept coming back every week like a junkie. The family is too perfect you just want to punch them. Jessica Biel was really the only star to break out and she's not that good of an actress! You may call this Aaron Spelling show a guilty pleasure, I wouldn't disagree."
5,7th Heaven Season 1,I love being able to re-watch one of my all time favorite shows. I look forward to purchasing the rest of the seasons.
4,CUT A WAY,THIS PRODUCT LET ME CUT DIFFERENT SIZE PINEAPPLES WHILE LETTING ME SAVE THE OUTSIDE FOR PINACOLADA.
5,The easiset way to cut and serve a pineapple!,This product is perfect to core and cut your pineapple. The pineapple is ready to serve in just a couple minutes. I love this pineapple corer and recommend it to all of my friends!
4,Easily get real pineapple out.,Easy way to get the real pineapple out. The three different sizes makes sure that you have the right size for any pineapple.
4,quite fun,"I bought two of these, one for myself and one as a gift for a friend (we share a love of pineapple). We are both pretty pleased with this product. It is easy to use and it definitely makes pineapple slicing an easier, less messy task. My only complaint is that the slices are a little on the thin side so you can't really make a good sized chunk."
5,Easy Slicer is a great description,"It is very disappointing to wait a year for my pineapples to mature, only to screw it up when I attempt to cut it. I used this device for the first time today, in seconds I determined which of the three cutters to use, cut off the top (to replant for next year) and then slice. Unbelievably easy, with the added bonus of a very decorative drink cup :~)I might be gadget crazy (many say that I am), but this is one of those that even if you only buy (or grow) the occassional pineapple, you will be happy with the results and you will be able to enjoy your pineapple in seconds."
5,Love this gismo,"We eat a lot of pineapple in our house and I always thought I was managing just fine with my sharp knives and why would I need something like this vacu vin.. and then I tried it. I should have bought this thing years ago. So easy to use with three separate sizes to fit whatever size pineapple you purchase. The small size slicer is quite small and certainly I would never buy a pineapple that wimpy so I probably won't get much use out of that one.I can prepare a whole pineapple now in a few quick simple steps and there is very little wastage of the fruit. The empty shell of the pineapple after using the slicer makes a nice little presentaion for fruit, sorbets and ices etc. People think you've gone to trouble in presenting your desserts and all you are doing is using up the left-overs from the vacu vin! Really like this, would recommend it."
5,Great for PineApples,"This is a good product for preparing whole pineapples into slices. If you follow the instructions you shouldn't have any problems. I recommend you request the version (set of 3) that comes with center core removers for various sizes of pineapples. The only problem I have with this product, is that it is not made of metal."
5,Great Gadget!,"I rarely bought fresh pineapple because it was such a hassle to prepare. Not anymore! I love this slicer. It's a snap to use, and you don't have all of the ""pricklies"" to pull out because you can select the size of the cut. Clean-up is a breeze - I put mine in the top rack of my dishwasher."
5,worth the price,"We LOVE this product and have enjoyed fresh pineapple weekly since purchasing it. No fuss, very little cleanup. I always avoided buying fresh pineapple even though my family loves it. The process of coring and peeling always made a mess. Now, no fuss, no mess, fresh pineapple in seconds."
5,Pineapple Cutting Made Easy,"Bought one of these slicers because my daughter was buying cut pineapple at the local organic food store at twice the price of a whole pineapple. How hard could it be to cut a pineapple? Not hard at all. Cut the top off and depending on the size of the pineapple, pick the size slicer and away you go. I thought since the outside was so hard you would need a lot of pressure to cut the inside. Fooled me. So easy to cut and clean up the slicer. If I do not need the hull of the pineapple for drinks or putting the cut pineapple in for cute serving, I cut the pineapple in half for easier release of the slicer.Loved it so much, gave one as a gift. Need a gadget for cutting pineapple, this is the one to buy with the 3 sizes."
4,Review of Pineapple slicer,The product works well and it is simple to use.However the written instructions are not great and are difficult to follow.
5,Pretty cool for cutting pineapple,"Overall, I think this product is pretty useful and far less work than cutting pineapple with a knife. I purchased the version with multiple cutting sizes to accommodate different sized fruit. If you find cutting pineapple a chore and have room for one more gadget in your kitchen, you will probably appreciate this product. I really like this product for the quickness and ease of ""gutting"" most of the fruit from a pineapple. However, it's effectiveness does depend on how ripe your fruit is and whether the pineapple is firm or soft. If your fruit is pretty ripe and softening, then this product is a little bit messy and may ""crush"" your pineapple. If your fruit is quite firm, you may feel like you're getting an arm workout. But either way, with this item you can be snacking on the the heart of the pineapple fruit in two or three minutes - which is pretty cool."
4,Makes cutting a pineapple a breeze,"I've had my slicer/corer for over 6 years now and it still works great. There have been one or two occasions where the pineapple ""shredded"", but it must have been related either to the ripeness or type of the fruit itself. The vast majority of uses have produced even, neat spirals with little or no mess. I brought some pineapple in to work today and a couple of my co-workers thought I had bought it pre-sliced!Yes, there have been a couple times when it's been more difficult than others to pull the meat out of the shell, but again this has been rare. And I've never had any problem with the handle being loose. I find myself buying pineapples much more often now because they were such a pain to cut before I found this tool. You can also use the shell afterward as a decorative fruit bowl.Maybe it doesn't work well on Hawaaian pineapples, but I guess that's a small price to pay for living in Hawaii!"
3,Pineapple slicer,"Works okay, but would probably prefer the metal blade style. This one can kind of mushed up the pineapple. Still, it slices pretty well."
1,"Mangles pineapples, slices too thin","I am so surprised that this tool gets such high reviews because it completely mangles pineapples and makes ridiculously thin slices, as others have said in prior reviews. I wish I could return this product. Maybe I'll just get rid of it -- it's that useless."
4,Multi size pineapple corer,"This product is well made, easy to use and works great. One suggestion not included with the directions is to cut the pineaplle in half first. This makes using the corer muck easier on the hands and cuts much faster."
1,Not worth the Money,"I purchared this "" 3 shafted"" slicer a few months ago.it worked fine unitil the fourth pinneapple.The black buttons on the handle slide inward and release the handle from the shaft when you try to pull the pinnapple slices out of the shell.you are better off buying a cheap one for $7.00 that will work for a year or more."
5,This is terrific!,"This wonderful tool is a must for anyone who likes fresh pineapple. It works! I've had mine for over a year and use it often. It is sturdy (the handle has never pulled out when pulling the sliced and cored pineaple out of the shell). It is fast and easy to use. It does require some strength in your hand to push down and turn, so if you have arthritis it may be a bit hard. I love having the shell of the pineapple to put melon balls and pineapple chunks in for for display. I like being able to chose from 3 sizes of slicers. I was skeptical at first but when I found out how easy it is and how well it works I bought 6 more for gifts. Everyone I've given one to (including my prof. chef son-in-law) loves it!"
2,unsatisfied,The slicer is all plastic. It cut 2 pineapple good and then the blade tore and did not cut clean. It appeared the blade was worn. I would not purchase a plastic cutter.
1,Didn't work at all for me,"Was excited to try the pineapple slicer, since it had such great reviews. It arrived today and I tried it tonight. First of all the handle kept popping off and when it did cut some , it just turned the pineapple to mush. My husband also tried it and he had the same results. It is going back tomorrow."
1,"Mangles the pineapple!! Lousy directions! Messy, too!","I read all the positive reviews and bought this thing. I've tried it several times, thinking it would get easier to use, but each time I end up with shredded pineapple -- NOT nice rings like the pictures.I checked the directions again to see what I was doing wrong. The directions are pictures only!!!In one picture in the directions, they show you tipping the pineapple sideways as you drill into it. I tried that and the pineapple juice spilled on the counter.Then they show the rings (ha!) sliding off the drill-type part. Well, the mangled bits of pineapple are stuck in the opening and you have to push it out.I wish this worked but it hasn't so far for me. The only positive thing is that, with effort and mess, you can end up with an empty pineapple which is cool-looking. I hope I can return it."
5,best ever pineapple slicer,I used to dread when my wife would bring home a fresh pineapple. I usually made a juicy sticky mess of the counter and me. But this slicer works with little or no mess. It just cuts right through the pineapple without cutting the outside skin. All the juice stays inside. I love it. Bring on the pineapples.
5,Amazing!,"WOW! I didn't think this thing would actually work - but it does, and perfectly. I'm never cutting a pineapple again. This slicer does all the work with perfect results every time. If you're hesitant about buying this - I understand (I was too), but don't be! You will not be disappointed."
4,Works well,"This product was pretty easy to use and cut the pineapple into a long spiral which was easy to cut into bite size pieces for serving. The counter was too high to use it effectively because I am only 5 foot tall and you do need to be able to use a downward pressure. Moving everything to the kitchen table solved that. There was a lot of juice created, maybe because my pineapple was pretty ripe, so put it inside a bowl when you cut it and you won't have a mess to clean up! And you will have some yummy fresh pineapple juice to add to your orange juice or what ever you want to do with it."
3,A Mixed Bag,"As a high school history teacher, I have mixed feelings about this video. It is informative and contains good background visuals. I can listen and learn from scholars intellectually discussing the life and reign of Henry VIII; few students will have the stamina to learn without being entertained. It is a good video, but is best shown in the classroom in bits and pieces."
4,This book saved my sanity,"I was so glad to find this book-- my daughter's new behaviors were driving me crazy, and I absolutely could not get a handle on it. This book is simple and easy to read. It gave me some insights on how all of these wonderful new skills that she has - reading, writing, empathy, to name a few - are also changing how she sees herself and our family."
3,Nice product with limitations.,"Works well and included software can be useful.You can remove the included software if you wish the additional space on the drive.It can block other USB ports if they are close, so it is of limited use to me.Nice construction aside from being a bit too big to use with laptops or in other locations where there are addtional ports nearby. If you only have a single port then this is very nice."
1,This is a vocal/piano reduction.,"I received this score this morning and was completly in shock at what a disgrace Dover had published. Please note, I am a very pleased fan of what this company has produced, but I feel that this score is one of the worst that I have seen. Schoenberg's Gurrelieder is know for its use of one of the largest late-romantic orchestras ever required. Unfortunatly Dover has provided the public with a score that lacks any of Schoenberg's orchestration and has printed a piano reduction done some years later by Schoenberg's pupil, Alban Berg. To publish a piece like this in a piano for before a publication of Schoenberg's original. This would be a great addition to the Dover Miniature Score series ALONG with the orchestral version."
5,Lancome,I have used Lancome for about 12 years now. I am a big fan of most of their products.This cream is a wonderful addition to your normal routine. I purchased this product to add a extra layer of moisturizer to my daily routine.I always love the smell of Lancome. This moisturizer is light and goes on easy.I would recommend this product.
4,Not bad at all... My first E:FC read,Ive heard bad things about some of the previous E:FC books but this one was the first I decided read. I must say it was very well done. The premise was very Season 1' ish for those of you dislike subsequent seasons of the show. Although Boone is absent in this one the story features Auger and Da'an heavily and Dr. Bellman makes a cameo as well which was a nice touch. I dont want to get into the details too heavily but Ill say that this would make a great episode of E:FC and leave it at that. There were a couple of inconsistancies but nothing important. Overall an excellent read and E:FC fans will enjoy it. I hope Heritage is half as good.
3,"""Oh, no, not my recorder....!""","A strange organism lands on Earth making objects and people disappear with its touch. On Gallifrey, all energy is being drained from the Black Hole that helped give the Time Lords their power, and the only one who can help is the Doctor, all three of them! A very enjoyable anniversary. Pertwee and Troughton's interplay is incredibly hilarious. Troughton is just wonderful with the interaction with the Brig and Benton(where's Yates?). Some great new Gallifreyan continuity. Omega is a great villian, projecting every line into a forceful statement. You almost feel sorry for him. Sadly, Hartnell could not be in all the story due to ill health. Also, the budget is almost non-existent! The gel-creatures are unintentionally funny just at the sight of them. It's a shame that the Master or the Daleks are not in this one, as they certainly have a right to be. Not the classic that it could have been, but still, a very enjoyable adventure for the undiscriminating Who fan!"
1,"Broke, and never worked great to begin with","We bought this snow cone maker last summer, and soon found that it was very difficult to turn the crank to shave the ice. You could get carpal tunnel syndrome standing there for a half hour to make one cone, or you could buy a nice electric model and save your wrists!"
2,A case of stilted writing,"I had really looked forward to reading this book. It appeared to be classic example of the genre. While the plot promised to draw me in totally, I found myself stuck and distracted by the author's style. I am starting to wonder if the prose is deliberately off-putting as a foil to the discrepancies in the painting. I hope so, because the inclusion of both American turns of phrase and an excess of English idioms makes the piece feel unreal. At times the text comes across as if many different people contributed, causing it to be disjointed.I have not finished yet and really hope the plot comes through to save it in the end."
2,The Apothecary's House,"I did not care for this book - the protagonist seems like a callous, superficial woman. Too bad - I had expected more."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT / MAD,"I PURCHASED THE $140.00 BOTTLE AT AMAZON/BEAUTY ENCOUNTERS. I WAS SOOO DISAPPOINTED. THE EAU DE TOILETTTE ""MUST DE CARTIER"" WAS EITHER DILUTED WITH WATER OR SOMETHING, OR WAS SO OLD IT NO SMELL LEFT TO IT. I'VE WORN THIS FRAGRANCE FOREVER AND IT SHOULD BE WONDERFUL. I WILL MAKE SURE TO NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM BEAUTY ENCOUNTERS AGAIN AND WILL PASS THE WORD ON. TO TOP IT OFF, THEY SAY FREE SAMPLE WITH EVERY ORDER....""NOT"" !!!"
2,This is an intresting way to do a soundtrack,"I don't really like how the only music on these cd's are from the movie scenes in the game, Would have only given 1 star but the music was ok enough to give it 2. I would have liked to hear all of the games music, the movie scenes are just not enough."
1,BORING AND WAY OVER RATED HICK WRESTLER.,"I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS WRESTLER IN PARTICULAR HE'S GOOD BUT THE BEST I DON'T THINK SO, THE REASON I DON'T REALLY LIKE FLAIR IS BECAUSE HE IS WHAT THEY CALL A ROUTINE MAN THAT'S WHAT THE LATE STU HART CALLED HIM AND HE IS RIGHT BASICLY HE DOES THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THE OTHER THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT HIM IS HE SUCKS UP TO A LOT OF WRESTLERS AND CRITICIZES A WHOLE LOT OF WRESTLERS THE PEOPLE HE SUCKS UP IS HARLEY RACE, RICKY ""THE DRAGON"" STEAMBOAT, ARN ANDERSON, GREG ""THE HAMMER"" VALENTINE, SHAWN MICHAELS, AND TRIPLE H. AND HE TALKS TRASH TO THESE WRESTLERS WHO ARE THE BEST EVER BRUNO SAMMARTINO, ULTIMATE WARRIOR, ""MACHO MAN"" RANDY SAVAGE, MICK FOLEY AND BRET HART. I MEAN COME ON WOULD YOU WASTE ALL THIS MONEY FOR THIS DVD AFTER ALL THE TRASH HE SAID ABOUT THESE WRESTLERS, I WAS A RIC FLAIR FAN BUT AFTER WHAT I HEARD RIC FLAIR SAID TO THESE WRESTLERS FORGET IT! IT'S GARBAGE."
1,Prehaps the worst D.V.D set ever made,"Could this D.V.D be any more boring and stupid, I am really bothered at the thought of so many positive reviews concerning this D.V.D when what is on it is utter crap"
1,Some Details....,"Here are the details on the much anticipated Ric Flair DVD, ""WWE The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection 3-DVD Set"" to be released in Nov.:-MSG Debut match vs. Pete Sanchez 3/1/76-A day in the life of the Four Horsemen-His match with Triple H from 5/19/03 Raw with a post-show tribute that has never-been-seen before on TV-Plus all the promos & controversies surrounding his greatest matches against-Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Barry Windham, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Terry Funk, Sting-as well as his 1992 Royal Rumble victory."
1,gimmick man,"Flair is what i like to call all gimmick with idiot Americans buying into it. He may well have been a great amateur wrestler in high school but who isn't, being a good amateur wrestler don't mean your going to be a good pro wrestler, the reason he may look good in the ring against guys like steamboat is only because steamboat makes him look good. Flair has achieved certain achievements in his life like returning to the ring from a broken back curt icy of a plain crash and using politics well to help him get to where he is, it must take a smart man to not be good in the ring and still be a popular wrestler."
1,this dvd,"This DVD exmplifies brilliance and a story of one man who started out as a bus boy for the tool box but ended up being one of the greatest figure four lock heroes of our time.Hey Delphi, are you threatened your boyfriend Nature Girl Richard Flehr is not a real hero but just a guy who books himself to win so he can look good in wrestling history books? Do you realize Bret Hart is a better wrestler than Ric Flair could ever be? What is your fascination with Ric Flair? Do you wear your bathroom robes playing your odyssey 2001 soundtrack walking down the aisle of your bathroom? Do you bleach your hair like every other wrestler to look like Ric Flair? Why must you be so hateful? Its not my fault Bischoff was smart in WCW and picked talented wrestlers over a guy with giant man boobs and some old guy named Arn who couldn't tell what time it was."
1,This D.V.D KILLED MY LOVE FOR WRESTLING FOREVER,"I guess this D.V.D really did me a favour, I will go so far as to say, that this D.V.D has killed my love for professional wrestling, once and for all. I still do not mind wrestlers such as Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit, but Ric Flair man does he ever suck this D.V.D just goes to show that wrestling is intended for 5 years olds my title of the review sums it all up."
1,Horrible,"This dvd set defines overrated. Flair admittedly has a great current act as the crazy old man but he is a horrible wrestler, people must have had long attention spans in the 80s because his ""classic"" matches would be DUDs today. To make it worse all his matches are the same and way too long. What do you expect, 80s people thought space invaders was a good game.I would rate this dvd 0 stars, but I decided to give 1 star because this dvd is quite generous giving 3 packed disks for the price of 1. However, 10.5 hours of crap is still crap."
2,WWE: The ultimate ric flair collection,"This dvd was exactly as described, but that is also the problem. I found it to be very boring and only focusing on a small handful of rivalries Ric Flair had. I would have like to have seen more behind the scene interactions and ""never before seen footage"". I didn't learn anything new about the Legend Ric Flair that I did not already know. I give it 2 stars simply because Nature Boy is still the G.O.A.T but I have no need to watch it again. Skip it, unless you're having trouble sleeping!"
5,A must have for any wrestlling fan,Don't expect to se the VHS version of this because there is none.It has Flair's rivalries with:Ricky SteamboatTerry FunkDusty RhodesHarly RaceStingBarry WindamIt also hasVs. Terry Funk Clash of the Champions IXvs. Steamboat from both Clash of the Champions VIII and Wrestle War '89vs. Harley Race Starcade '831992 Royal RumbleWWWF Debut vs. Pete Sanchezvs. Cripple-H RAW 5/19/03 with NBSF of the post-show tributeThe Plane Crashthe History of the Four Horsemena Day in the Life of the Horsemenand so many cool interviews as well as Flair and Windham vs. Eddie Gilbert and Ricky Steamboat.You have to get this if you want to consider yourself a true wrestling fan.If I could rate this from 1 to 10 I would give it a 22.
1,Disappointed Child,"My son was so excited to make gummy insects. The instructions were simple enough but the food ""color"" did not produce a color at all, it was more of a dull yellow. The pipette was not even able to suck up the mixture, which thickened less than a minute after we mixed it. I ended up pouring the mixture into the molds. The gummies did not set after 15 minutes in the fridge. My son kept checking and even the next morning they were still mush. He was very disappointed that his insects did not turn out well. When he asked to taste one I almost said no because the ingredient mixture and final product were so unappetizing. NIce idea, poorly executed."
2,Not realistic,"I approached this book with an open mind, and had great hopes for it's potential. Unfortunately, the idea of giving my power away to someone else just to avoid conflict goes against my core values. As women, we do this too much (historically). Personally, I have been practicing many of the author's principles/ such as putting myself in another person's shoes to gain perspective. I just am not comfortable with giving my personal power away to avoid conflict. What does this do to our self esteem?"
2,Not Practical,"I just finished reading this book, as a trainer in law enforcement and self-defense, I can honestly say that this book is a waste of time and money! I suggest a course/book called ""Verbal Judo"". This program is excellent and used internationally by law enforcement, corporations, hospitals, and various schools. For more information go to (www.verbaljudo.com) trust me, this is what you need to reduce your stress level at home and at work!"
3,Guilty Pleasure,"""The Invasion of Time"" is a guilty pleasure, but that's what makes it a classic in my eyes. ""Doctor Who"" lets slip embarrassing moments at the best of times so it's best not taken too seriously. Yes, you'll see aluminum foil aliens, spacecraft with brickwork and crazy drinking straws. But all that leaves Tom Baker's Doctor to carry the whole thing, which he does delightfully well. John Arnatt's portrayal of the Time Lord Borusa is my favorite and Milton Johns' Castellan is required viewing for Americans who don't know what a 'toady' is. I've read that the producer was at his wit's end and had to write part of this himself; it shows in the furious outbursts The Doctor delivers (reason enough to buy this one) and his companion's departure, both of which are notably uncharacteristic. Also of note is how Contoller Rodan was a prototype for Romana, the Doctor's companion in the following adventure."
1,Yuck,"One of the worst episodes ever, what a difference a writer really makes. A letdown. I was shocked that the Doctor could even take part in this trash, maybe he was possessed, another episode."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"'The Invasion of Time' is a guilty pleasure to be sure but I find it immensely entertaining. 'Doctor Who' lets embarrassing moments slip at the best of times and it's best not taken too seriously. Yes, you'll see tinfoil aliens, brick buildings standing in for spacecraft interiors and crazy drinking straws. That leaves Tom Baker's Doctor to carry the thing which he does surprisingly well. This story features John Arnatt, whose portrayal of Borusa is my favorite. Milton Johns' Castellan is required viewing for we Americans who don't know what a 'toady' is. I've read that the producer was at his wit's end with this one and it shows, especially in the uncharacteristically furious outbursts Tom Baker was given to deliver (reason enough to buy this one) and the bizarre departure of the Doctor's companion, Leela. For extra credit, note how the Time Lady Rodan displays prototype attributes of Romana, the Doctor's companion in the adventure following this one."
2,not worth it!,"I got this cartridge for my HP DeskJet 932c. I'd been using the regular color ink cartridges and got good photos but thought this new ink would be even better. It's NOT! What's more, when I print on plain paper in ""draft"" mode, the color portions are wrong. I've cleaned the printer contacts twice according to HP instructions, ran all the utilities, and still cannot print in draft mode with any color. However, B&W in draft mode is great, as long as there are no color graphics or text. I realize this printer is old, but I didn't have a problem with it until I switched to this cartridge. Huge ripoff!"
2,Color quality varies with different cartridges,Have had to throw away two cartridges out of six because the color was so bad. When the color is right it's great but this can get expensive. I just bought two more and will update my comments when I open the next one.
2,New formula's not too great,"We've had two of these. Both have had quality problems. One wouldn't produce cyan, the second produced excessive amounts of magenta. Reconfig, test pages, realignment and head cleaning didn't solve the problems. Will return to cheaper refills."
5,Muppet Babies A - Z,"I had this book around when my first two daughters were little. Now that I am a new mother again, and of course, have gotten rid of all the little people toys and books that we used to have, I desperately want this book back! It is a very well written, a-z book with little rhymes on each page pertaining to the letter. It uses objects that are familiar to children at very early ages, that they can relate to. That's the reason why I love this book. PLEASE, if you happen to have it, I will buy it from you. It's a very cute book!"
1,"""Compression information mismatch"" error, Windows XP","V6.0 of the software is buggy in both compression modes, posting the following error ""Compression information mismatch [4886-1316]""Very poor Support..."
1,Never buy this product if you want compression,"Hi all,Backup software that originated from Veritas Simple Backup can make compressed backups, but cannot restore them. The error message""Compression Information Mismatch [4886 1316]"" means,in essence, your data is gone for good.I have this information directly from the product manager for Simple Backup/Backup My PC when I complained about this more than a year ago. He was extremely annoyed with me and asked the question ""what do you want us to do about it?"" Duhh...perhaps either fix it or stop advertising compression? ""No"". There are no plans to fix it.So, while the product is pretty good, if you want to recover your data, do not use compression with *any* Roxio or Sonic product or wherever else they sell the code.danp.s. I used ISOBUSTER to rip the tracks off the compressed CD and then tried a wide variety of tools to ""decompress"" the data. I was not able to, nor would ""Support"" tell me what compression scheme was in use. Sheesh."
2,Stomp's PC Backup too slow,Stomp have introduced some excellent features but the program is too slow for practical purposes.
2,Beware of Special Features,"Regarding the main content, this is not a complete compilation of Peanuts movies from the 60's, unfortunately. Wish there was more included. The biggest problem I had with this collection, however, was the Special Features section. Didn't think I needed to pre-watch anything on a collection of Peanuts cartoons for appropriateness with the kids. Was horrified as we viewed together some really gory, scary and violent trailers from some Warner Brother movie ""classics."" This should not have been on these DVD's, or at least there should have been some rating or warning for parents! Hope this review saves other families with young kids from having this experience of accidental exposure to inappropriate content."
2,one disk was completely empty,One disk was completely empty and it was a hassle to have to send them back. I was very unhappy
5,What can you say? I love it...it's Charlie Brown...,I love this video... It had a lot a videos that you cant find really anywhere.It arrived in great condition and two days early at that.
1,waste of money,"I opted to buy the larger poster(16x20) for my sister in law because I read reviews the smaller version(8x10) was hard to read, what a waste of time &money! The colors are so bland& blah not like the picture at ALL shown & it looks like a copy of a copy so its still hard to read>:(, I bought it bigger so i could frame it for her for Christmas & she could have this beautiful picture of something she loves in her house, Soo angry what a waste!!!"
3,Please Abridge,"Excellent information. Chopped up by terrible attempts at epic cut scenes, all in a hazy red and accompanied by badddd music. Would be half the length and so much more enjoyable without these scenes. The information is bountiful, deep and very educational- better then other videos of it's ilk. But the cut scenes and music make me want to cry and are embarrassing to try to sit through with someone else."
3,"Not bad, not great.","Pretty interesting individual vignettes, but leaves a lot unanswered. For example, the issue of when prehistoric humans discovered fire is never addressed. The location of where early humans first evolved is documented, but no discussion as to why they might have been spurred to evolve. There are also some inconsistencies - we are told that a certain behavior by homo erectus enabled them to acquire the nutrients they needed for expanded brain growth. Then later we are told that homo erectus did not, in fact, have a brain larger than the apes. The bits of re-enactment, which are interspersed throughout, also don't add a whole lot. Overall not bad, but could have been better."
3,Good subject but too many obnoxious special effects!,"I know a person shoud not judge Alaska by all the biting bugs so I will try to be fair about this but this documentary was driving me crazy with all the pretentous wierd sound effects and naked actors howling at the moon. I mean really!! Who is this intended for? Tweleve-year-olds taking a break from MTV? The hard science is great and the contributuion to our understand of who we are is IMPORTANT. But next time out I wish they package a ""kids"" version and an ""adult"" version."
3,Simple little side table fills the right spot,"I already had a brass and glass table in that room. This little table fits right in. Rather inexpensive-looking, but it's only a little side room, so that's ok."
1,I wish I could dream this phony away.,"This Dream Interpreter does not interpret your dreams. It gives a small selections of words to choose from and you must do the rest. This is a big waste of money and time. I was hoping you could fill in the dream and it would have a meaning for it, but it does not. Some people say that if you fly in your dreams it is about wanting to get above the situation you are in, or a setting free. This software gave no such meaning or any other meaning for a dream sentence of this sort and no other meanings for any dream one could have, unless you dream in a few definite words it knows, Ha, Ha! I could decide more about my dreams on my own then through this Dream Interpreter CD. So keep dreaming for another to help with your dreams. I am!"
2,shocking,"Was I the only one who DIDN'T like this book? I liked the beginning and hte scene where Jane goes and punches Ryan at the restaurant in front of everyone. BAsed on his vengeful actions he'd taken against her, he deserved it! (SPOILERS AHEAD) But I sure didn't like or understand why later she ended up giving in to him when he was seducing her, especially as he constantly insulted her. I thought, does she have no shame?? Ok, so she was attracted to him..even though he'd done a lot of damage to her financially..it happens, but to give in to him that night in the hotel and then to let him MOVE in to her house?? Crazy. I know she was having problems getting around with her hand being so sore, but still, she s hould have had enough pride to not let him take over the way he did and ask a friend to help her, instead.I guess some see his actions toward and with her as being romantic/appealing, but I definitely didn't."
1,Warning!!!!!,This is NOT the a cappella group from Indiana University that had the smash CD 'Holiday Spirits'. Be forewarned.
1,NOT THE REAL SNC!!!,"This CD is not the Straight No Chaser you're looking for! This is a compiliation of some jazz/blues, not the reformed acapella group with IU origins. Wait for the new Christmas CD coming out in Oct 09 or buy the already released Six Pack EP."
2,Wrong group,This is not an album by the acapella group 'straight no chaser'It ia either another group with the same name or the title of the cd
1,NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE,"This is NOT the Straight No Chaser that it was shown with as something else I might like. I also purchased ""With A Twist"" by the REAL Straight No Chaser and it is wonderful. I have no idea who this is supposed to be but definitely NOT SNC. Very misleading."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"If you are looking for the acapella version of Straight No Chaser, it's not this one.It needs to be put in it's own catagory so that there is no deception. This is false advertising."
1,on the lowdown,"Like others here, I was fooled by the artist name and believed I was getting the a capella group. This cd is a total bust. One of the worst purchases I have ever made. I think it should have a WARNING sticker saying it is not the a capella group people expect...it's a 1997 live recording of an obscure jazz group of the same name."
3,On the Getdown,"not the group i expected, not the acapella group that i've seen on PBS, and the one my son saw at the Madrigal Festival."
4,waterproof sandals,"Love the comfort but I am accustomed to Birkenstock sandals.Got these to use as I am walking our two Labs.My only comment has to do with the ankle strap.It's comfortable ,yet I wish it were not there.I do think these sandals are worthy of a favorable recommendationWT"
3,Lukewarm video,"Penthouse delivers many beautiful women in this video but it's poor picture quality and lack of imagination disappoints. Virtually the entire video features women dancing and displaying in front of an ordinary studio chair. It's wiser to purchase the ""Pet of the Year"" videos."
2,Very lousy cable,"I bought this cable to replace my component cable which comes with the Comcast top-box. However, the quality of this cable is far below the bar, not even gets close to the quality of the comcast component cable. I guess the cheaper cable doesn't make good quality though. I should try some ones with good quality."
2,"bad cookbook, decent party planning book","ONLY buy this book if you're looking for party planning ideas. the recipes are overly simple: for example, a few pages are dedicated to teaching you how to lay out deli meats for a buffet. many recipes suggest using store-bought cake and muffin mixes...gross! the pictures are pretty, though."
1,Can you say disappointed?,"The writers of this book are uber creative, but this book is no indication of their talent. Have to give this one two thumbs down:("
4,A great guide!,"The book reviews a wide range of digital illustration issues in a very graphical and clear way. Its illustrations are beautiful and its very well designed. Unfortunately its huge amount of themes makes it a little bit superficial. A great guide or reference book, not recommended for total beginners. Due to its techical information, the book will become practically useless very soon."
1,poor and old,i just can say that this book is a great block of paper! pooooorr and very old! Unfortunately i loose money!
3,"Good stories reprinted in ""Limerock""","This book contains only five short stories. I think they were all reprinted in the author's next collection, ""Limerock."" Read that one instead of tracking down this book."
4,F-F serial cable,Glad this 'old-style' cable is still available through Amazon. The F-F serial configuration is hard-to-find today. We use it to connect our old GPS units to a PC.
2,Stick with RPGs Jeff!,"Lord Toede was pretty much of a let down to loyal DL readers. There was more comedy then there was fantasy. It had no point and never went anywhere (literally, every time Toede died, he came back to the same place, making for a very boring story line). This book could have been really good, describing Toede's life and showing how he got to be a Dragon Highlord. Instead, it was about Toede coming back to life again, and again, and again. There were about two sentences detailing Toede's life before the War of the Lance. I thought it was a real let down to the rest of the Villains series (not to mention DL in general). To conclude, I ask (beg) Jeff Grubb to stick to RPGs and to leave writing to people with actual talent"
3,Don't let the cover fool you,"Monkey Kung Fu, or Monkey Fist (''), is a Chinese martial art which utilizes ape or monkey-like movements as part of its technique. It was perfected by Glorious Grand Master Peter Sellers.There are a number of independently developed systems of monkey kung fu. Examples includes Xingzhemen (''') named after the protagonist Sun Wukong of the popular Ming dynasty novel Journey to the West, Nanhouquan (''') or Southern Monkey Fist originating from the Southern Shaolin Temple as well as the more well known Da Sheng Pi Gua Men ''''' style of Hong Kong. Drunken Monkey uses a lot of throat, eye and groin strikes as well as tumbling and falling techniques. It incorporates a lot of false steps to give the appearance it is defenseless and uses a lot of off balance movements.But if your opponent gets you on the ground, you will wish you had studied wrestling instead of this book."
2,I'll See You in My Dreams,"I found this book to be very weird. The book is about a girl talking about what she would do if she were a skywriter. She is going to see her uncle and she dreams of doing things for him, with his plain. The book has good coloring and neat drawings. I think it's nice what she wishes she could do to cheer him up. It a ok book to read. So read it!Mark C"
5,Ahab's Bride,"Ahab's Bride touches your heart and soul. When Hannah wept, I wept. Each character in this wonderful novel, even Ahab, is richly drawn. I felt as if I had opened the door to Hannah's world. From the innocent eighteen-year-old with stars in her eyes when meeting the magnatic Ahab to the widow years later weeping for her dead husband who spit in the eye of God. Ms. Gouge is a superb writer. She sweeps into your world and tells you to follow in her world. I encourage everyone to open the pages of Ahab's Bride and go along on Hannah's journey to become the independent and mature woman she came to be."
4,Was very interesting,"I know the time & place was different from today, but there were to many big words where I had to get my dictionary. Hum, maybe I learned something!"
5,James Herriot,great series! funny too! the whole family can watch! I did every sunday on pbs.MY MOTHER LOVED THE SERIES TOO.
5,Excellent Service,"This seller got the tapes to me in a timely manner and in excellent ""like new"" condition - tapes play fine. I am very pleased."
5,A wish come true,"For all of the faithful ACG&S fans another wonderful series. The first two volumes were great and the VHS quality superb. I would suspect that the brisk sales in America has prompted the producers to bring out the third volume. The first three are the best because they capture these wonderful characters just before the start of WW2. I would also like to mention that Jim Wight has written a wonderful book about his father called ""The Real James Herriot"" (Ballantine Books) The relationships between the actors and the ""real"" Herriot family is wonderful. Thanks Amazon for telling me the good news. Hello VCR. I promise I won't watch them all in one evening. ( Liar!)"
5,It gets better and better!,This series is addictive. This is the best of the BBC and has to be one of the finest series ever made. Once one has seen one series one is made restless to see the rest. Indeed they are such classics that it is easy to look at them over and over again. There is always something new to discover. The characters become like good family friends. I am delighted to discover that series IV will be soon available.
5,Great BBQ Guide,"I just moved to North Carolina a few years ago, so this guide to NC BBQ has been indispensible. Garner has spent many years sampling and reviewing NC BBQ, and he really seems to know what he's talking about in his reviews. He's picked the 100 best BBQ joints in NC and gives a wealth of info about each, including address, phone number, hours, menu items, etc. Of course, he spends the most time talking about the BBQ.The intro contains a concise history of NC BBQ, including a pretty thorough discourse on the differences between Eastern Carolina BBQ and Piedmont BBQ. I'm a newcomer to NC BBQ, which usually consists of smoked pork with a vinegar-based sauce, so this background info is helpful. Most of the places he reviews are well-known locally and are pretty casual, preferring to put their emphasis on the BBQ instead of the atmosphere. A terrific guide and an enjoyable read. Highly recommended for NC residents and fans of BBQ."
2,Many Problems,"MY experience with this product has been awful. It photocopied fine, worked amazing. But the problems started when we tried to install it on our PC. Fine for a few days, but then it wont print. It hangs then prints ages later. It wont scan properly either. Now, it wont even let me install the driver again. It hangs aswell, i have to pull the power 'cos i can't switch it off. It is definately going back today! Do not buy this product!"
2,Sorry I bought this,"I'm sorry I bout the Xerox WorkCentre M940-950 (the 950 has a paper feeder but they are basically the same). I have had nothing but problems with it. I often times have to unplug the unit to get it to reset so my computer can send documents to it. When I upgraded to XP the Xerox web site said they closely worked with Microsoft to assure the WorkCentre would perform well. If they worked closely with Microsoft I can't tell. The downloaded driver doesn't install correctly. It's a nightmare to get the thing to connect to my computer now. In fact, I'm just going to eat the cost (as I tossed out the box weeks ago) and I'm looking for another unit from another reputable manufacture.I will say the only good thing this unit is the copier. It did make wonderful copies of some photgraphs I had. If you plan on hooking it up to you computer pass this one up!Very Unhappy!"
1,Bad decision to buy this copier,Printed poorly from the start. Very small and expensive ink cartridges. I am an infrequent user and so print heads always clogged. I am tossing my M950 in the garbage.
3,Great other then....,"When I first got this book I was very happy...until I started playing through ""smells like teen spirit"". There are several misprints, and not little ones. The whole second line of the vocal is completely screwed up. Very disappointing."
4,clebanoff,FIRST LISTENED TO IN THE 70'S CLEBANOFF HAS HAD A SMALL FOLLOWING DUE TO IS LACK OF PUBLICITY. I BELIEVE HE WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME AND VERY MUCH A MUSICAL GENIUS.
4,A Little Magic,This is an adorable look back to the early days of Walt Disney World. You see the park in all its holiday finery. My grand son loves it. Only wish Walt Disney World produced more like this. I would recommend this as part of the holiday show lineup.
1,Beward - No index!,"There may be 2000 sound effects on this disc, but unless you have time to listen and catalog each one, it will be difficult to use. Effects are divided into several file folders but individual effects are identified by number only. If you have a ton of time on your hands, you can build your own index, but you will probably want to use this disc as a frisbee long before you get your index finished."
3,Useful but not as versatile as one might want,"I think this is a fairly good product.I haven't used it that much.Pros: You just put a sleeve in the freezer, so it doesn't take up much room and you don't use up all your ice chilling wine. And it doesn't make the bottle all wet.Cons:Black plastic looks a bit cheap. I think the chrome one looks better.The sleeve will only fit a standard wine bottle. Any bottle that is a bit wider (like champagne) will not fit."
2,Vac U Vin Wine Chiller,"Product was not as I anticipated. Says it will chill a bottle of wine within a specified short period of time. I took a room temp bottle and used the ice pack that I froze for several days, & tried to chill the wine. After sitting for about 20 mins, it was barely cool. The ad does not mention anything about a freezer chiller sleeve coming with it, so I ordered a pkg of (2). I now ended up with (3) since the ad was not DETAILED enough.I am very dissappointed with the product. I only use it to basically keep an already refrig bottle cold & to stop it from sweating on the table. I would not recommend this product as a chiller. AGAIN, very disappointed.Vacu Vin Prestige Table Wine Chiller"
3,"""No Voy A Llorar"" ...I aint gonna cry...its OK!","This album I did buy thanks to Amazon because without them I would of not even heard of this album. But I did wish I listened to more samples. Tracks 3. Por Tu Desprecio, 4. La 2A. De Nina, and 5. Cumbia Del Bombon are the best songs on this album. (Listen to those here) The rest are not that bad but I listen to these 3 more then the rest of them. Although this album is not that new it still manages to hold a unique sound of cumbia of its own. Aaron Y Su Grupo Ilusion are a very talented group who do not get as much exposure as other groups in the U.S. and I think thier time is over due. Thier newest albums are not that different from this one even though I think this album shows more originality. Not a bad buy but it may take time before really get into these guys. But if you are a huge fan of cumbia like me then this album is right for you."
4,Not what you think!,"Many people pick up a AAA guide expecting to find only directions, hotel locations, and a towing number. Nothing could be further from the truth! AAA's Spiral Guide: Andalucia is filled with not only excellent maps, but manages to give a respectable account of many of the riveting sights each sub-region has to offer.The book itself is in fact broken down by these sub-regions; for example, Seville has it's own section, as does Granada and it's surrounding area. This, along with each section's illustrated map, help turn wherever you find yourself in Andalucia into a more familiar place.The guide is not just for motorists, either. The list of attractions may be easily used by cyclist, bus, or train passenger with equal ease. However, I reccomend backpackers go with Rough Guide or Lonely Planet, which will go into more detail regarding items of importance to you.While not as all-encompassing as the Rough Guide or Lonely Planet, AAA's Spiral Guide: Andalucia rates as a solid buy."
5,Punky All- Grown Up,I'm remember being about 8 when this show orginally came out. This show was great for little girls to watch much different then the shows today. Watched this with my younger sister and we laughed a whole bunch in fact we just wanted to be just like Punky and have Punky Power. Punky grew up so fast much like all of us. The best part of course was Henry adopting Punky as his own every though he could have been her grandfather. What little girl wouldn't want Henry as a father or grandfather. It was very sad to see this show only last for four seasons I think it could have lasted a little longer. If you have a young girl defintly buy all four seasons she will cherish it.
3,Punky Power,I am glad I got this as it now completes my set but I was disapointed with no real good extras for this last one. Thank you for you fast and prompt delivery and a great price.
4,A Great Childhood Memory Brought Back,"This long awaited (at least for me anyway) conclusion to the Punky Brewster season was exciting. I remember growing up with Punky and her friends during the 80s, and am so excited that I get to re-live those childhood memories.However, the reason for the four, instead of five, stars, is that I would have liked more special features, especially for the last season. It seems almost unfair that new movies have tons of extras, that expand over an entire disc of special features, sometimes more, and then a season gives you the episodes, and a few cartoon episodes, in this case, but thats it.Otherwise, I was very happy to finally get the final season to complete my collection."
5,The Final Set And Well Worth the Wait!,"I grew up with Punky Brewster, which certainly dates me quite a bit. When I saw that the series was available on DVD, I wanted my own daughter to experience ""Punky Power"" and so we have bought every single one.The fourth season, which is the final season, was totally worth the long wait. My daughter and her step sisters have not put it down once. They absolutely adore Punky and how can they not, she's so incredibly lovable and cute.The final season continues to take a look at many of life's obstacles and learning experiences in a clean, fun way. One of the most endearing qualities of the television show is that every action has a consequence and is a valuable learning tool for us, as parents.We own all of the seasons now, and I plan to save them when my children tire of them, for my grand children.If you loved her the first time around, consider giving your children the chance to know her too. My friends children always leave here wanting the series on DVD too."
1,One of the worst books I've read in a long time,"I picked this book up at a second hand store, it was only .25 cents figured what the heck. OMG, what garbage, it was almost as if the aurthor Virginia Heffernan was not only bi-polar, but also high off of maybe LSD at minimal marijuana. She rambles incoharently and changes direction like a fish flopping out of the water. If you want to read a real book by a real intelligent woman, I suggest the likes of Anne Rice, or Taylor Caldwell. Books they have written truely paved their respective places in history true trailblazers of thier time. Heffernand just proves, anybody can get a book published in this day in age. I recommend using your copy of the Underminer as back up toilet paper or possibly as a joke gift at Christmas time if you play the white elephant game."
5,The Underminer,"My favorite part about this book is how easily one can slip into the shoes of the person being undermined. This book isn't about making you feel good about yourself, or making you feel like it's okay to be you. It's not about positive reinforcement. It can, however, help you identify the underminer in your life."
1,Totaly Sucks,This has to be the worst piece of garbage I have ever read. Totally Sucks Ass she need to go back to journalism school.
1,Definitely not a typical novel,"This book was a real disappointment for me. Although I loved the idea of the novel (I mean, who doesn't know someone like the Underminer), this doesn't read like a novel. There is no mutual conversation or character development- instead, the readers are treated to a non-stop barrage of one-sided dialogue by one character. The characters are purely one dimensional . . . in fact, the two characters in the book (of whom only one has any actual dialogue) could be male or female, we have no idea, because that's how vague they are. I understand that the author probably intended it that way, but it's distracting. If you enjoy reading plays, which only features dialogue and no other exposition, than you will enjoy this book. But if you're expecting an actual plot with characters, you'll likely be as disappointed as I was."
3,I had forgotten about this book... but LOOK OUT!,"i actually have a friend right now who is this kind of haplessly evilfriend in a church i attend. He is like an EVIL Sancho Panza. Hecan't even help himself, and i can't help him ultimately. The WordDE-FRIEND should have been 'invented' in my vocabulary beforethe advent of Face Book. Sheesh. If you are clueless about relationshipsthen maybe you should read this book."
3,Hey There,"Initially, this book was about as engaging as being forced to listen to some young bimbo ""oh my god! like totally, no way"" on her cell phone, but the book is more enjoyable, in a twisted sort of way. You can't help but hate the Underminer, and some days, you love to hate the villain.Though I give it three stars, and feel that's generous, considering that this is more of a monologue than a true work of fiction, it's still worth a read.The back jacket quips are, I hope, part of the gag. For example, in Malcolm Gladwell's (The Tipping Point) blurb, he claims that he ""started laughing with the first sentence..."" Well, the first sentence in the book is: ""Hey there."" (fyi-- The second sentence is ""Whew what a day."" )-- Poor Malcolm is that easily amused?? LOLAnyway- worth a read, library-style, but I doubt I'd pay $19.95 for it."
1,I want my 4 hours back,"There are so many wonderful books out there, I'm not sure why anyone would spend time reading this. I hate to bash this and inadvertently turning into ""the underminer"".Not only do you not want to associate with ""the underminer"" (the main character) but having to endure the entire book with the ""same repeated theme"" of one character undermining the other is redundant and unimaginative writing. Unfortunately, the story doesn't advance and you're unable to ""care"" about the characters in the book.Of course, this book must have pleased some ONE in order to be published, right? There were moments of controlled laughter on my part. Sorry to say, this book is not for anyone looking for a meaningful, riveting or even humorous writing."
1,"Cliches, Anyone?","Jesus, God, help us -- this thing reads like the writers are trying to get a gig on ""Will & Grace."" Where's my puke bucket?"
1,Very Disappointed,"I am suffering the devastating effects of 14 years of marriage to a first-rate Underminer. I was looking for serious help and didn't realize that this was a novel and not really a self help book. I suppose in a sick, twisted way this book can be seen as funny, but reading it for me was really just painful. Especially the last chapter, it's just all too real. That's what these people are really like! I'm in a very, very sad place right now and would love to find real help for dealing with someone who has destroyed your life and in starting to put it back together again."
3,Too static,"It's half of a brilliant concept, but Albo & co. needed more of a plot than ""Underminer is successful. Victim is not."" Repeat ad nauseum. I'm not sure why they decided to forgo a plot, because they're clearly talented. Yes, the underminer is evil. Yes, we hate him/her. Now that you've created this character, could you please give us a catharsis already? Or some form of revenge?After a while, it stopped being funny & just got frightening.Still, I gave it an additional star just for this:"" I was looking for serious help and didn't realize that this was a novel and not really a self help book.""While I'm sympathetic to your situation, ma'am, these things usually say ""fiction"" on the back and are IN THE FICTION SECTION of bookstores, not the self-help section.Dear Christ."
2,Not So Funny,"I love the Vicar series. Somehow missed the two episodes on Vol. 6 and so purchased it. It's a disappointment. Not so funny. A little more sexual innuendo - but somehow the two episodes just don't get the giggle rolling. I do have Vol. 1, 2 and 6. They are great!Mark Becker"
3,Like it,This was the best price I found on a OSHA 25 person first aid kit. It is a decent product for the price.
5,"Futuro Medical Hosiery Knee High, Small, Nude, Firm, Open Toe, 1 Pair",This product is everything that it claims to be. It is just the right amount of firmness that is needed.
2,Lancome Intensive recovery results.....,"Was hoping that this product would help the extreme dryness and wrinkles that were developing , but unfortunately, it did not. In fact, if you have very sensitive skin, I would first recommend that you use very little of it, to see how your skin reacts to it."
5,Read this book,Read this book and it will change your life. You will be utterly astounded at what you find out about the Drug War and how we are not only losing it but our freedoms along with it. We apparently remember and learned nothing from Prohibition. Read this book and you will want everyone to.
5,"A well researched, well written work on US drug policy.","It is easy to find critiques of US drug policy. The trick is to find one which is readible, credible, and useful. That is what Mike Gray's ""Drug Crazy"" is. This book will bring anyone, whether new to the topic or an old hand, up to the minute on the origins of the War on Drugs, and why the war has been lost. You'll learn the players, see the historic accidents that lie behind todays delusions, and discover what ideas can help us deal with what has now become two national problems: the effects of abuse of drugs, and the effects of the War on Drugs. I recommend this book highly. Every library, every legislator, and every person concerned with drug policy issues should have a copy."
5,Learning from the lessons of history,"Those who forget the mistakes of history are condemned to repeat them, and unfortunately the disaster of alcohol Prohibition in the 1920s occurred too long ago for most of us to remember it. Fortunately, Drug Crazy builds a bridge to that time, from whose lessons we can draw guidance today. That the Prohibition experiment (which was at least started and ended democratically, with Constitutional amendments) caused so much damage--especially crime, including the highest murder rate in US history--is a tragedy, but that we have not learned from that tragic experiment and are repeating the mistake on an even greater scale...that is indeed a crime. Drug Crazy goes on to trace the tragicomic escalation of the Drug War from its racist origins to its current heights of madness. This well-researched book is highly recommended for understanding how self-righteous and self-serving bureaucrats got us into the Drug War, and how we can get ourselves out."
4,Great Book,"Very insiteful view of how drugs were viewed, prohibition and very good ideas on how we can indeed ""get out of this mess""."
5,"This book clearly illustrates the folly of the ""drug war""","This book clearly illustrates the folly of the ""drug war"". The author draws simple and clear lessons from history and modern times to illustrate the point.This book challenges many cherished delusions. They are, however, delusions."
5,Outstanding !!!,An extremely well documented look at the War on Drugs taken from a mostly historical perspective. I couldn't put it down. A must read for everyone who thinks this ridiculous persecution is justified.
5,Surprise! The Government lied again!,"This is an outstanding book that is easy to read and goes into detail about the U.S. Government lies and hypocrisy involved in ""The War on Drugs"".Every american citizen should be aware of the erosion of liberties and the outright lies and deceptions on the part of the Government."
4,It's all true!,Unfortunately what he says is true. I am a USFSA Gold Medalist (Figures and Freestyle) and a USFSA judge (though I don't like to admit it). Judges who have little to no skating experience seem to prevail in this sport. The corruption is even in the lower levels of skating. This book rings so true that it's upsetting. I couldn't read it before going to sleep. With each page I hoped the judges that I liked and respected were not named. I'm glad someone had the nerve to speak out for the skaters.
5,A beautiful sport's ugly secrets exposed,"I endorse this book not only as an Amazon Reviewer but as a skater. The dirty deals, corrupt judging, and federation attempts to advance their favorite skaters at the expense of equally talented but less-popular athletes (who, for whatever reason, don't fit their cookie-cutter out of date ""image""), Jackson tells all. Should be required viewing for everyone in the sport, especially the federations, who must take a hard look at their own ethics and make some changes."
5,The truth about a lot of things,"I loved this book, from the biographical parts to the skating expose. What a mess to be a teenager anyway, let alone one in a repressive religious community with an alternate sexuality! I found that part very touching and thought provoking.Not all men in skating are gay, by the way, I happen to be the parent of a straight male ice dancer. We sure do know a lot of gay young men and they deserve our compassion and understanding for the extra challenges they face.The figure skating part is absolutely dead on true. I was present at some of the events described in the book, and find Jackson sticks uncompromisingly to the facts.Let's hope we can get our sport free of the scandals and bad behavior, before we become a complete joke."
2,Meh...,"I have a different expectation of this type of book than I would of a novel or an essay collection. For one, I don't expect stellar writing -- but I do expect competent writing, and this book did not deliver. Maybe it's not even the writing that failed so much as it's the editing. Typos abounded, spelling of names changed, random words appeared in sentences... The mistakes were so distracting that I was tempted more than once to put the book down out of frustration. Also, the last portion of the book was a bit hard to follow. The events were so compressed that I wasn't 100% sure of what was happening. The first 2/3 of the book was well-paced, though, even though it sometimes went on tangents. That said...this book did give me a lot to think about, so that's good."
1,Missing pieces,This ballerina puzzle had approximately 8-10 pieces missing. My 4-year-old granddaughter was certainly disappointed when she realized she would not be able to complete the puzzle.
4,Nice resource to use with novel,"I like using this book as a resource in which around to build a novel unit. The Cay is a great book to read to my students, and I have used several activities from this book."
2,Not that good,It is about a white boy and the S.S. Hato has sunk in the middle of the ocean. The boy gets hit in the head and is blind the next day. An African-American man recused him from the sunken ship and floated away in a little boat. They finally see land and settle in. Both of the struggle to keep alive in hopes of returning home safely. They learn to stick together and the boy learns new survival skills. This book probably wasn't good for me because I had to read it for a book report and it just wasn't my type. But I will say that if you like small but heart-warming books then the cay is your kind of book.
3,"Nice, but for $35, it should be laminated...","This is a really great chart to help learn about the vast array of varietals. But, for a pretty steep $35, it should be laminated, rather than just paper. I was disappointed."
1,A Disappointment,"There is nothing new in this book - nothing any teacher (or student) hasn't already seen or done a hundred times in a typical elementary classroom.I was especially disappointed that while the blurb on the back cover (also on the Amazon site) reads ""Learn from the Theories of Reggio Emila"" - there is NO discussion of said theories.If you really need a book to tell you to drape a table with burlap or draw a pumpkin for Halloween, then this book might be for you."
3,You already have most of the fonts,"As an add on, for only a few dollars, this product is fine. It will give you a few fonts that are not standard with an operating system."
2,"So So, not all that exciting!","It may have 4,000 fonts but alot of them are basically different versions of the same font. A little skinnier, a little fatter, bold, italics etc etc. Some fonts literally have dozens of different styles, yet it's still the same font. It doesn't take long to add up to 4,000 when you do that. If your looking for fun, funky, cool fonts, don't get this, they aren't on here. OK, that's a lie, there aren't very many. It all depends on your tastes. There are alot of good fonts on here, and it's well worth the price to have them all in one place. Sure beats downloading them all individually, but don't think that you're going to get 4,000 DIFFERENT fonts, not here."
3,"Some really are comic, others just silly or truly foolish!","I love a good comic travel tale, and also like tales of women travelling, so I thought I'd really like this collection of tales. I did like a few of the stories a lot---for example, getting lost in the Tokyo subway, a crazy turkey chasing a woman in Central America, a cruise with kids gone bad---but many of the tales left me cold. It's funny when good travel turns bad, not so much when people do incredibly misguided things and end up in trouble because of that---like going into deep wilderness and purposely not recording the trip or taking necessary maps. That seems more like a cautionary tale than anything funny. I'd have also liked a more balanced selection of travellers---maybe more mothers or older women, and not so many grad student vegetarian types? I did read through this, and kept hoping for a few more of the really funny stories, but was mostly disappointed."
2,disappointing,"After all the good reviews, I was expecting more. It is very well written, but expect foul language and liberal overtones in many of the stories. For example, the ""When Cubans Become Vegans"" essay seemed more of a commentary on American government than a ""hilarious misadventure tale."" On the other hand, I really enjoyed some of them like ""El Jolote Loco."""
5,The Unsavvy Traveler - Good for Laughs,"I laughed out loud at some of the short stories found in this collection of ""Comic Tales of Catastrophe."" Ingrid Wendt's poetry reading in An American in Venice debacle; Julie Gerk's story, El Jolote Loco, the crazied turkey whose feathers seemed to erupt he was so agitated and Lucy Bledsoe's tale, On Being at Sea, in a leaky boat were truly funny.Other tales of ill advised hikes into mountainous jungles, a good bear story and eating unsavory food in a foreign country are among some of the memorable contributions these 28 women made to make a book I read from cover to cover. I highly recommend this book as one that will lift your spirits, but will also give you a thrill and some great surprises."
3,A very mixed bag,I am not impressed. About a third of these are genuine and great fun. Another third are average (your friends probably have just as good stories) and the other third are lousy and/or irritating. I have a hard time with a story about someone who makes dumb choices from the outset and expects everyone to laugh along with them. It makes women look dumb when they make bad choices. Not recommended; I left it behind in a hotel in Napoli.
1,"Incomplete ""kit""","For the price, I was expecting a complete drain kit, including the actual drain and pipes, etc. I also think that the word ""kit"" implies that everything you need will be included. This is just the flip switch and drain cover, no drain, no pipes. I sent it back."
2,Predictable and ultimately rather bland,"I heard some of JBT's stuff from Bonnaroo and was pretty impressed - no doubt a good solid live act. This album has it's catchy moments, but I found the song structures to be very predictable and the lyrics to be utterly trite and uninspiring. There's no doubt some talent here, but there's certainly no new ground being broken. If you want to hear the REAL (original) politically and environmentally-minded Australian rockers, check out Midnight Oil. They're the real deal. JBT doesn't hold a candle to them; they're merely playing in their shadow."
4,Jbt,My husband had been looking everywhere in the shop for this cd but couldn't find it. Go online and you can find everything.
4,Something with substance,"I first heard of JBT when they opened for John Mayer in Berkley, CA. I was floored. Before they started playing I was hoping their set would be short - rarely am I impressed by an opening act. When they left the stage I was wishing their set was longer, much longer. I wanted more. I bought Three at the concert and found it satisfying, but not nearly as moving as their live show. Catch their live shows whenever you can and buy the album to show some support for a band with a lot of potential!"
1,Total waste money!,"This DVD totally wasted my money. It contains only a few things that have relation with The Rock. Other things are view points of The Rock from some people that The Rock don't even knew them, and the picture quality is really bad, and contains notthing, I totally regreted to bought this DVD, if you bought this DVD, you will feel the same way that I feel. Trust Me!! I still cannot believe that The Rock could let them make this DVD for him..."
4,Interviews from the Anthracite Region,"This thin volume of 100 pages is loaded with first person interviews from people who were there through the era. Included are stories of immigration, working in the mines, living through the Great Depression, the conflicts with the United Mine Workers, management, strikes, etc. The narrative is told in the first person and gives one the feel of being there. Its nicely done. Oh, that we had a hundred more like it."
2,Wrong book to help with review,"I bought this book because it said it would help me review for the BOC exam I was going to be taking in the coming year. I was fooled, I wish there had been reviews on this book that informed me how terrible it was. There were many typos, that actually changed the meaning of a word so it got very confusing & I spent a majority of my time trying to figure out what they were actually trying to ask me. Then some of the answers were completely wrong. I recommend getting another review book other than this one, it's a waste of time and money."
4,Love it!!,"I ordered this popcorn because it resembled the one I used to buy from Popcorn Palace and I wanted to see if it tasted the same. The order came very quickly and was packaged very well. The smell from the box was amazing!! It made my mouth water. It came in a resealable air tight bag that allowed you to see the product. It tasted amazing and was very fresh. I can't stop eating it and the quantity of the product is more than I expected too. I will be munching on this up until the holidays. Thank you so much! i will definitely be ordering more in the future. The Popcorn Palace doesn't sell the cinnamon candied one anymore and I get it much cheaper through you, so I am very pleased and will be coming back for me. :)"
4,Bonking Good!,"Not as funny as the wedding of Hugo and Alice, but there are snippits of hilarity. Too bad Simon turns out to be a real jerk. The first episode really touches upon the humanity of clergy and how one's needs get in the way of what's better-off for the whole community. The wise man bit in the second episode is down-right funny! Alice shows some intellect, finally . . . but one of her scatter-brained thoughts can only go so far. Would highly recommend this to all of us ""Vicar"" lovers."
5,Gloriously Bittersweet!,I laugh and cry with the cast everytime I watch this episode. The actors are brilliant. The stories are well written with humorous little twists that make this series such a delight to watch over and over.
2,"Nice rubber case, real cheapo belt clip","Once again, Cellet has a nice product, except for the belt clip. the clip is so sorry that you cannot hardly use it. If you want a nice rubber case to carry in a purse, buy this one. but don't count on using the belt clip."
2,"Thin, flimsy and NOT form-fitting","When I received this case, I had little difficulty placing it on my phone. The reason being the case was larger than my phone, so thin that it was flexible to a fault and the cutout placement did not match the phone.To give an approximation of how thin the case is, the silicone is roughly the thickness of a disposable latex glove used in the medical industry. A rubber band is thicker. Typical silicone cases will absorb the impact of a fall should the phone drop and hit the pavement. This is not that kind of case. I would recommend this case only for those who need it for decoration."
1,Silicone Case,"This item fell apart in a week. There was little protection provided when it was still ""in-tact"""
5,Very Good,"I had 2 skin cases before are were not nice looking, this one makes the same job but it fits nicely and looks better."
2,Not crazy about,"I felt myself constantly ""adjusting"" the case. I want it to fit and not move...........this one doesn't......sorry"
3,"As described, just not for me.","I used this case for about a week until it became rather annoying. The case does what it's supposed to by protecting the device from scratches, however, as someone who keeps the device in my pocket (rather than on my belt) I found it rather annoying to get in and out when I needed it- the silicon grips the fabric in the pocket.Also note, the black shows dust, a lot of dust. Perhaps other colors do not, but if you want a clean look, DO NOT get black."
1,Lousy Cheap Case,I had this about two weeks and it broke. Only fit tight for a few days. I had another case that I got with my Palm 650 that lasted years. I would not recommend this unless you like to throw away your $$ like I did
1,Bad and Loose Case!,I received this case immediately but i expected what i saw on the picture n wasnt exact. I should have expected this for the price. I have the Treo 700wx and case i got was too loose n rubber band thin. I am using it but kinda annoying. If u have another kind of Palm Treo might work for you.
1,Memory Trees--Family Trees For The Scrapbooker,"A vertual waste of time and money. Amature art. Might create an idea for the more talented among us, but not worth your purchase.Memory Trees--Family Trees For The ScrapbookerChild scrapbooker, might enjoy this book."
2,"Maybe good for a beginner, but disappointing overall","I had hoped to be able to use this workbook in a teleclass, but it's really not designed for that. It's strictly designed for one person to start on a project and follow the prescribed program in the workbook. While that might be valuable for someone just starting out, it seems unrealistic for most leaders who are multitasking all the time."
3,A smaller Burp Gun,"Many years ago, I had a burp gun. It shot ping-pong balls. I bought three of these guns for my grand kids. These guns work fine, excepy they shoots smaller custom made balls. They can not shoot easily available pinp-pong balls.This is a major disadvantage. If I had known this fact beforehand, I probably would have omitted this Christmas gift. I already have had to buy the kids extra balls, at an extra price. But the guns do work."
2,Burp Guns,"I was really excited to find these guns on Amazon $2 cheaper than then the ones in the Sky Mall magazine. My complaint is this,on the same page I looked at it showed ""people who bought this item also bought"".....and it showed ping pong balls. I purchased the ping pong balls at an additional cost of $18.95 for 140. A good price but they don't fit!!! It didn't offer replacement ball and you are not told you have to buy special balls. The gun is advertised as, like the ones you had in the 1950's.No they're NOT, those did use ping pong balls!! Now I have 140 ping pong balls I either have to go though the hassel of getting a refund or eat the cost. Buyer beware..... you'll need special sized replacement balls."
4,Great item for boys no matter what their age !,I showed this item to my husband and he remembered having a similar toy in his youth. It is a great item . . . no batteries. It certainly creates a fun-filled time for everyone.
3,Goofed,"This is a great toy for OLDER children. Made the mistake of giving them to my 6 and 7 year old nephews and they had a really hard time making them work. On the other hand, I also gave one to my 19 year old who looked at me like I was nuts. But then took several shots at her father, then stated, 'ok, that was fun'. Important to realize that ping pong balls WILL NOT fit in this toy!"
1,Not worth reading...,"So I'm an adventurous type.. I like to read material by new authors all of the time. I came across this book and thought it might be worth a read... boy, was I wrong. This book is yet another obnoxiously idealistic story about coming of age during young adulthood, except this one comes in a book rather than as an abc family special. Don't waste your time."
3,where have i heard this b4?,"lemme preface this by sayin' that not everyone waz fortunate 2 cop ""rocksoul entertainment, vol 1: rock of ages"" when it first dropped, so that'z what kept me from purchasin' this CD. if u can't find tha 'rock of ages' joint, then by all meanz, do pick this up, but if you're like me and u DO have it, this iz a regurgitated waste of time. over half of this CD popped up on 'ages' so unless there are stronger mixez of thoze cutz on 'compositions', you're betta off stickin' with 'ages'. (have i said that enough timez already? (lol))yet and still, this dezervez three starz on tha strength of tha 'ages' trax, and that it'z sound urban Gospel music that effortlessly competez with, and routinely bestz, tha secular commercial stuff u hear now 4 tha earz of an eazily-influenced youth. and hey - u might not b able 2 cop 'ages' now, anyway. so go on, do your soul a favour and check this out. PEACE."
4,great story,my 5 year old son loves this story and its surprise ending!the play within a story framework is very clever but may be too complicated for very young children to followmjdykstramother & book lover
5,A book for all ages,"Who's in Rabbits House is one of those few book that people of all ages can enjoy. The book is beautiful to look at, the illustrations informative and clever. (Check out the lions.) It reads aloud beautifully, and even the youngest reader can be given a part to become part of the experience. The cultural contect is respectfully presented. The reader becomes one who learn that of the Masai vilagers that strength is less important than intelligence."
5,yay,Awww this book was good. I work as a student aide in my school library and the pictures caught my eye so I read it. Good pictures funny story.
3,Sort of cheap looking,The horses look like they are plastic in the picture when in reality they are felt material. They look sort of cheap. Do not recommend if giving this item alone. Would recommend them if you want to supplement this gift with a barn or something else. Sort of disappointed.
5,great purchase,this horse collection was a gift for my daughter and she has been playing with this non stop. highly recommend.
4,great toy,"Bought for my daughters bday, she played with it for hours. All the kids who come to my house love to play with these horses!"
1,Awful - fuzz will be worn off in days...,"Bought for christmas and within 2 days the ""furr"" was already wearing off and my kids barely played with them... STAY AWAY."
5,Pasture pals,I love this gift! Great price for what you get. These are small horses but are still great. They are soft so you can't let them get wet. My daughter just adores them! Great gift.
3,Fine product.,"The horses were cute but, I expected them to be made out of plastic not a light weight foam product. My daughter still likes them, but has not played with them as expected."
3,not correct colors or sizes,"If I wanted to teach about house color or size, I could not do it with this set. And all three colors they used were not too accurate."
5,Great,My niece is getting into all things horse and this was a great addition for her so she can learn the different breeds.
5,3 year old love it,Perfect size for little hands. The case helps prevent the horses from going everywhere in the house. My three year old named all twelve horses. So cute.
2,"Lots of horses, but not very durable","We got this for my horse-crazy daughter for Christmas. Barely played with it and one of the horses needs some super-glue attention. I don't know how it happened, but she is very good with her stuff and mostly has been just lining them up on a table and making them ""talk"" to each other. I expected more in the way of quality."
3,pretty horses,these horses are very nice and the case they come in is good but my son just started playing with them and 1 already has a broken leg and he was being careful
5,Christmas gift,I ordered these for my Grandson for Christmas. They went perfectly with the barn I got for him!! He was a thrill to watch him play with them. They are fuzzy so at one point I saw him petting them!!! Sooooo cute!!!
1,do not buy,I would like to express my disappointment in my order with these toys. I ordered for a Christmas present for our God Daughter but i cant even consider giving them to her because of the poor quality. what a waste of money.
5,Really nice horse toy,"I bought this for a gift but will be purchasing this for my own daughter too. This is a really nice toy for a child who is into horses. There are numerous small horses along with their descriptions on the back. They can be stored in the ""barn"". If your child is just sorta into horses, it may get old but if she is really into it, I'm sure she'll love this. Well made & a good price!"
2,Disappointed in the quality,"My daughter received these horses as a Christmas gift. We are huge fans of Melissa & Doug, so we were excited to get them. My daughter (4) is happy, but they are cheaply made. I was under the impression that they were solid and sturdy, but they are hollow and made out of plastic. I purchased a set of 3 horses for my daughter at the $1 store and these look exactly like them, except these were much more expensive. They are fun for kids, but definitely WAY overpriced."
3,Cute Horses,"My daughter liked these horses! They were pretty cute but the case was not really what I expected as it doesn't have a front closure and the pictures behind the horses are made out of thin cardboard. Overall, though, my daughter likes them and that is who I bought them for."
3,Poor quality for the price,"My 7 year-old daughter LOVES these horses. If she wrote the review, it would be 5-star. But as the person who paid for them, I am pretty disappointed by the quality of the horses. Some can't stand up on their own, and all of them are losing their flocking. My daughter has 2 other little horses which are identical to the ones in this set - and those came from the ""Everything's A Dollar"" storeIt's a very cute little display case, and like I said, my daughter is tickled with them. But I wouldn't buy the set again."
3,Good but not waterproof,"My daughter loves horses almost as much as she loves bathtime. Unfortunately in this case the two did not match! The horses' ""fur"" and manes did not withstand constant bathing. Also, they are made of plastic and break rather easily with rough play. I LOVE the crate they came in though. We kept that and I screwed it onto the wall, and we use it to showcase other miniature animals!"
5,This was a gift,"This was a Christmas gift so have not seen how it has held up or how much it has been played with. But the 8 year old who got it really seemed to be pleased with it. The horses are ""fuzzy"" which I thought might be a problem but she proceeded to remove each horse and inspect them all. She then went off to play with her Pasture Pals."
3,Enjoyable but tails come out,"My daughter loves horses and received this before she was two. She plays with it almost every day and builds barns for all the horses, but the tails can be pulled out fairly easily. They can be forced back in, but they are coming out more frequently the more she plays with the toy."
1,Cheaply made horses,"I picked this up for my daughter's 9th birthday. She loves horses, so i figured was a good buy. How wrong was I.The horses are poorly made, poorly detailed, and look like rejects from the 70's. If you love horses and see this item....AVOID IT AT ALL COST.Is not worth the money. I am sorry I bought this item."
1,disapointing,i had bought this for my son for his birthday and the first day the mains came off the horses and then the hard-foam bodies started breaking.. my son is a horse fanatic and was very unhappy with the quality.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I ordered this Melissa & Doug pasture pal set for my daughter for Christmas. She's almost two and loves all things horses. I must admit both her and my son (3) love these horses and it may have in fact been the best gift (in their opinion) of the year.I , on the other hand, am sorely disappointed. Melissa & Doug are one of my favorite toy makers so i was stunned to see how cheaply made and horrible these horses truly are. They are covered in some strange fuzz that my son now enjoys peeling off of the horses bodies.I wish they would remake this set in plastic. I would happily purchase and give 5 stars if they were remade."
4,Great for the price.,"We bought this to go with a stable we bought online from Amazon as well. They are cute, about three inches tall. You have to be careful because when you pull the rubber bands off it is kind of stuck to their skin. I do not think they would hold up for little guys. My daughter is five and she is very gentle with them. But, I think if you put too much wieght on them their legs would colapse and I think the skin will come off really easy. Other than that I think it was a great buy for the small amount of money that you pay."
3,Pretty Satisfied,"This product was good overall. However, the horses are smaller than I realized and are not big enough for the large toy barn that Amazon paired it with. The storage box appears to be the nicest feature, solid wood, yet there is no cover for it so its not really practical for storage."
