2,works well but....,"I purchased these when my husband didn't want me to drill into our existing cabinets. They worked well but...the area where you stick the base in the cabinet is not as deep as the lock would like it to be. This makes the anchor shift over use and it eventually (after a few days of opening and closing) will get pushed to an angle where it won't actually catch and lock until you readjust it. So as long as you are always present in the room when the child is, it's fine...but if you are not, I am not sure it's fully trust-able if you have a narrow cabinet depth."
4,Like them,"We have these all over our house. We do not want to put screws in our new cabinets, so we use the tape option. Our 16 month son is strong enough that he can pull them off the cupboards, but we just put them up with more double sided tape. He is learning that when they are locked we do not want him in the cabinet and he is doing well now."
3,Great product BUT...,"The four pack of locks is great - if only the company would CLEARLY note the keys are sold seperately.This type of info should be printed BOLDLY on the FRONT of the product!!!A key is included in the two-pack, and a phone call to the company was answered with the explanation that these were as ADD-ON's for existing owners.Nice to find this out AFTER you get home and are installing them where the first point at which they mention ""Key Sold Seperately"" is in the last line of the instructions - AFTER you have installed them.Customer service offered to sell the key to me, ""or you could find a strong magnet and wave it around"". Hmmm...Good Customer Service would have offered a better solution - Great Customer Service would have offered to send a key out right away for the inconvenience.Pretty good Product, poor labelling, so-so customer service."
5,Excellent and NO SCREWS!!!!,"I have bought multiple types to secure the cabinets and these are by far superior. I bought the Safety 1st, which were going to be challenging to install and required a lot of time; which I did not have, so I never installed the silly things. I am impressed at the strength of staying power without being mounted/secured by screws! Now I tend to forget they are installed, so I end of giving them a sudden strong pull and then remember to grab the magnetic key. I would recommend ensuring you have either 1- purchase several keys, or 2-buy some easy to grip magnets to keep several in the kitchen just to keep it quick and easy to get into the cabinets. Luckily for me, I have the two magnetic keys from the Safety 1st products."
1,false advertising,"Having read the reviews, I see the problem. However, when you are buying ""Lock sets"" and the picture SHOWS the key being used, there is no way to know (without reading the reviews-which on the iphone I don't do) that this is just for the locks. I have never in my life been sold a lock withuot a key. So the titling of this is misleading and unfair. It's their right to sell things however they like, but not in a way that is misleading. I don't mind the ""squeezing every penny"" out of me if I knew that's the plan.Since I cannot review their use (because I received only the locks) I give it 1 star."
4,Excellent buy!,"These work great for my 11 month old who used to constantly try to get into my cabinets. I did not put in the optional screws (that's why I invested in magnetic, self-adhesive locks to begin with) and so far they stick on great! No complaints here.Installation was very easy - just follow the instructions!"
3,good product but useless without key.,"great product but it should be clearer that this does not include the key, you must buy it separately. this product is pointless without a key."
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! THEY DO NOT WORK!!,Nothing else to say really. My wife and I wanted these so we didnt have to drill into our cabintes and we installed theme on normal wood cabinets but they did not work. We spent almost an hour thinking we were doing something wrong which most will think when reading this review but this is simply not the case. We made sure we were doing everything correctly (1hr) and the cabinet doors still swung wide open because the plastic hook was not catching and locking the doors like it was supposed to. We sent them back immediately for a refund.
1,didnt work for my hutch,"First off, the 'key' you need isn't included in the package with the lock and it never said that (grrrr). Secondly, they don't work. A good yank on the doors and my 15-month old granddaughter had them both open."
4,Works well on our custom cabinets,This magnetic safety locks works on our cabinets where others do not. it's because our cabinets were custom made and so do not 'fit' the 'standard' push-and-open latches. I'm going to order more of them.
5,Great product,"These locks are great and require no drilling. I had previously bought tot locks, but they require drilling to install and are a pain. These just stick on, but they stay in place and make it so children cannont open the cabinet doors. They also come with screws if you would rather attach them that way. I have them on all my bottom cabinets in the kitchen and bath and are definately worth the money."
1,"Don't work, not a COMPLETE SET","This item does NOT come with keys (exterior knob) to open cabinets. Locks only! Tested item before installing and it would not work on 3/4"" cabinets."
1,Does not work,"This system does not work well. Our first attempt with swinging doors required them to be closed with enough force (but not too much) for the latch to catch. This would require way too loud bangs than what we are used to and wish. Most of the times the door would remain unlocked.We then tried using this on drawers and the same thing happened. The tolerances are too small for it to be easily installed. The latch moves on gravity and so it is too weak to catch and stay put. We abandoned this product and whilst the sticky portion is ruined, we will try to get a refund."
1,Horrible,I purchased this item to keep my son out of the cabinets. Only 25 percent of these locks actually worked. The locks functioned for about the first month then they stopped latching. I would much rather have put in a different brand because I am chasing my son just as much as I was before.
3,No key?,Why would the keys be sold separately? Now I can effectively child and adult-proof my cabinets because we have no way of opening them without buying the key... It would have cost the company 2 extra cents to add the key and I would have paid it if it saved me this time waiting for the separate key to get here.
3,They are exactly as described.,But I found them so small that is is very hard to keep the moisture level consistent. My seeds could not grow because they were either too wet or too dry.I gave these up to just plant in a post with soil medium. I have had much better luck with a regular pot.
2,Underwhelming,"I thought this would be a compelling collection of works that examine the idea of God from a variety of vantage points. Instead, it seems to be collection of the curators' friends' work that is smashed into categories that they really don't fit into, even if we stretch our conceptual minds. The curatorial idea is good. The sub-categories are good. I just wish the majority of the art in the book actually seemed related to any of that."
2,a music fan and dancer from CA,"I'm very disappointed in this cd. I had expected the same style of remixes of original artists as is in the Jive Bunny ""The Album"" (which is excellent and I highly recommend). This cd is distinctively not original artists more like some local band. Some of the mixes are not blended well either and even a couple of the same songs from this cd sounds poorly different than Jive Bunny ""The Album""."
5,english ivy soap,"It is deliciously wonderful. It leaves my skin smooth, soft and smelling wonderful. It really is coming in handy with swimming and having the chlorine drying my skin out. I am definitely going to buy more, and you really can't beat the price!!! Thank you for a great product.Maureen Jackson"
3,I'm all hampstered out!,"This CD is okay, but really only worth buying for 2 or 3 songs. The Hampsterdance itself is fun, and the Birdie Song (aka, the Chicken Dance) is a nice alternate version of the wedding reception and minor league sport favorite, but most of the songs are pretty annoying - and I LOVE novelty music!!! However, tunes like the two I mentioned as well as Thank God I'm A Country Boy, Dance To The Music, and the Christmas songs are cute, and if you can ignore the other tracks, this CD is worth a listen."
5,Total Fun!!!!,"This CD is so fun it makes you want to get up up and ""JAM!!!!"" I listen to it all of the time! I wake up hearing it every morning! I totaly LOVE this CD, and the hampsters are cute too! HAHA!!"
1,A Waste of Money,"Hampersterdance the Album is a huge waste of money. I had the chance to listen to it recently and I am so glad I did not waste my money on it. Reading the previous reviews I can not understand how people can actually like this music. One of the reviewers even has the nerve to remark that this album raises the bar for all genres of music. Give me a break! This music took no originality or talent to make. The makers of Hampsterdance are trying to cash in on a lousy product. I went to the web site and all I see are advertisement banners, T-shirt and CD promotions and reminders that say tell your friends about this site, obviously so the makers can make more money. This is over commercialization at its worst. Do not buy into this. Do not buy this CD."
3,Silly But Fun,"As a purist I miss the old Hampsterdance song. This CD is a jumped-up, overmixed version of the old theme, plus a host of other kiddie-techno-dance music. It's fun, silly and fluffy."
5,Even Hamsters Fall In Love... With This Album!,"This is surely the finest effort by the most accomplished dance music impressario of our time, Hampton the Hamster. So much has been said and written about Hampton and his Hamsters that it almost seems pointless to add one more glittering review to the pile. Even if I were capable of articulating definitively the impact that this record has had on the face of popular music, it would be incomparable to experiencing the magic for yourself. In that interest, I will say only this: ""Even Hamsters Fall In Love"" is the most beautiful piece of music ever composed, by either human or hamster."
1,HAMSTAZ WIT ATTITUDEZ,LISTEN UP YALL THESE HAMSTAZ KNOW HOW TO KICK IT U KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BUY THIS OR THE HAMZSTAZ WILL ATTAK.
2,Ipad2,Does not fit well on either of my cars. 2008 F-150 & ford edge. A bare iPad 2 does snap snugly in the casing.
2,Is it me?,"I continue to find Shelley's writing stilted, his characters wooden, his science uncompelling and his plots trivial. Any number of military SF writers do a more compelling job: Weber, Moon, Drake, Dickson, Pournelle - even Roland Green. Shelley seems to have taken a basic course in expository writing and over time his ability to infuse characters with complex emotions, conveyed in some way other than baqld narrative, has remained static. This is a book in which the author neither challenges himself nor his readers."
4,Only one more left?,"Yet another in the on again off again installment following our protagonist into ever higher commands. One of the interesting aspects of this series is that Shelly doesn't try and give us a campaign-by-campaign account or the hero's (Lon Nolan) career. it almost has the feel of a ""best of"" series which is refreshing and different. Shelly has also started to (thankfully) move away from the always predictable, and always boring formula present in many sci-fi military books. That of having a climactic battle at the end where the hero and his friends are almost killed, only to have some outside deus-ex-machina force come to save the day. My only knock is that the ending feels rushed. Like there was a publishing deadline and all the action and story lines had to be wrapped up in five pages. It's one thing to have an ""ends with a whimper"" finish, quite another to make it rushed. Overall a good afternoon's read, better than most of the sci-fi movies out there :-)"
2,Pras Could Try Later,"I Bought the album feeling Pras deserved a couple bucks since he really hasn't been active in the industry for a couple years. I was even a little hyped up when I grabbed it hopeing for some ole skwel Fugees type of joints or something.To be blunt, the album is below average especially for the artists who collaborated.A few beats are decent like ""Friend or Foe"" ""One Monkey Don't Stop the Show"" & ""Angels Song"", but the rest I couldn't listen to.Unfortunatly Pras is a rapper. Great tone of voice, but poor lyrics.You can tell the writting and vocal production was rushed throughout the album.I was disappointed. But the 3 beats I feel give hope. He should work on another album to redeem this unorganized album."
5,Great battery,Battery works great. Nice price. Hopefully it last a long time. Will buy it again when the time comes to reorder.
2,Absolutely fascinating!,"THE book for anyone who always wanted to know more about the Ascended Masters! Most books about Karma, Reinkarnation, the Seven Rays, the Violet Flame etc. only talk about the most known of them (and even that very shortly). Not this book - it contains more than fivehundred pages about more than twohundred of these Beings of Light. And it also precisely describes their heavenly retreats - how they look like and even where they are! Most of them are in the heaven right over special places on earth like Tibet or the Teton Range in Wyoming. There are so many of these retreats - there is a good chance that one of these powerful places is just a few miles away from your own home, what makes the book even more exciting to read. Highly recommended!"
3,It's OK,I was looking for something else. I wanted to know more about the 7 archanges and the chohans. Not all the others
4,masters and their retreats/review,I must say I find the content of this book very interesting and enlightling. I do have to wonder how the information given has been aguired. I would love to have that question answered.John
3,the struggle to survive,"Filled with out-takes from Byrd's journals (I presume they are actual out-takes -- no author's note in this book, but they are printed in italics), this book shows the decay of Admiral Byrd's condition during the long antarctic winter he spent maintaining the research station alone.I am growing weary of children's books told in free verse. Paragraphs would be fine. Other arctic survival tales have gotten the job done without abandoning standard written English. In this book, at least, the choppy sentence structure seems to speak in the halting way of a man slowly freezing to death. Mission accomplished, but really... We want our little boys to become good writers and good thinkers, and unless they read properly written paragraphs, they will think that stream-of-consciousness is acceptable for them, too."
3,"Interesting, but not very helpful","I liked the format, but was disappointed in that there really wasn't much advice on handling the ""problems"" when they surfaced. I really respect Dr. Brazelton and his child-rearing philosophies, but this book didn't really help with the frustrations that are sometimes overwhelming in parenting a toddler."
4,fun pocket game,"it is small enough to stuff in a pocket or purse, works well, and is fun to use. I did feel like it was a bit over priced, but it was a gift for my grandma, and she loves it"
3,"Vista 32bit worked fine, no disk needed",Product worked as good as any dial up modem I guess. After 2 weeks returned it due to no longer working. I only list this encase this becomes a trend. Power surges are common failure point in modems.
1,Get DSL,"CNET mobem is okay of getting in the internet ,but it log you off the internet if a call is coming for your phone. I wish that I have DSL right now. The mobem is so slow in surfing the web. Don't get this mobem;get DSL it better.Trust me"
2,"Not as good as previous model, too thick","As a big fan of the Spenco Walker/runner and crosstrainer insoles, I bought these for a new pair of Mizuno's that I got. Unfortunately, these red ones are a big downgrade from the previously green ones. It would appear they've increased the padding by like 50% across the insoles, particularly in the forefoot area. As a result, they don't fit comfortably in any pair of shoes I have as the old ones do. The top part of my foot always feels jammed up against the nose of the shoe. I could begin ordering a shoe size larger to accommodate them, but then I'd have issues sliding around(particularly running downhill), which is quite a bit worse.All in all, a disappointing upgrade from Spenco. Bring back the old green ones! Luckily, I noticed the crosstrainer one hasn't changed and still fits well. It's not quite as comfy as the old runner/walker one though, but it'll have to do since these new red ones are terrible."
3,Sweet Semi-relief,I have a chronic moderate to bad case of plantar fasciitis and I was hoping these would provide me with instant comfort in my new walking shoes. They did give me improved comfort (vs. the sole the shoes had upon purchase) but certainly not enough to shout from the rooftops about. I do think the Spenco inserts are very good quality and will continue to use these for shoes used around the house but will need to find an insert that is higher on the comfort scale for any longer walks.
3,Compared the Spenco Polysorb Total to Walker/Runner,"In my search for the perfect sports shoe insert, I tried both the Spenco Polysorb Total and the Spenco Polysorb Walker/Runner. Both are well made inserts, and both are cut the same length. However, of the two, I found the Polysorb Total to be more comfortable. For one thing the Walker/Runner insert has a very high arch, whereas the Total insert's arch is more modest. The Total insert is also a little thicker and more cushioned (it has a nice heel cushion). Both are much thicker than the cheap inserts that come in most running/cross trainer shoes. I put these in my ASICS cross trainers, and they are really comfortable. If you prefer a high arch, you might start with the Walker/Runner inserts, otherwise, I'd suggest that you try the Total Support inserts.Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of ""Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family."""
5,I love these.,This product helped from the minute I put them in my shoes. They were recomended to me and I love them. I purchased more as soon as I tried them on. The price was great also.
4,Great for Work,"I got some of these to replace the shoe-for-crews inserts in my work shoes. They're a little thick, so I had to rip out the sad remains of the inserts to make them fit, but it worked out. They take a little breaking in, since they are kind of stiff and the arch support is somewhat higher than I'm used to, but overall they are great if you work on your feet in a fast-paced environment or if you lead an athletic lifestyle."
5,Thank you,These inserts are very comfortable. I will soon be ordering more to go in other shoes I wear as per my doctors recommendation.
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about these inserts. I've tried 8-10 other inserts to solve some toe-numbness and was really excited about these. The were very comfortable when I first tried walking with them. However, after just a half mile, my feet were in horrible pain. I stopped my walk, waited a few days and tried again and the same thing happened. After about a half mile, I couldn't take the pain. Having said that, they seem to be well made and will likely work for many people, (unfortunately) just not for me."
2,Moldy smelling insoles,"I have used these insoles before and love them! When I received these, they looked to be alright, but there was definitely a very awful smell to them, like mold. I have a very sensitive nose and needed to put these back in the box right away because of the awful smell. Were they such a great price because of some smell defect?I ordered the same kind for my husband, and interestingly enough, these were normal...no smell. I also paid a lot more. ?"
5,great product,"great product and service, my old shoes became almost new after putting this products in it , great relief no more pain, this is my 3rd pair ."
4,Good insert for roomy shoe,"I have (most likely) plantar fascitis and need some extra heel padding and arch support whenever I'm on my feet. I found these to work great in my roomy house slippers. However, in my work shoes, the orthotic is too bulky and it leaves the dorsal surface of my feet squished! Not wanting to trade one problem for another, I am looking for a more streamlined orthotic for my work shoes."
5,Another Excellent Spenco Insole,"A little about myself first: I am a 200+ pound runner who averages anywhere from 5-10 miles a week running between 2-3 miles a day.Fit - These insoles have a slightly thinner heel cushion than the Spenco heavy-duty green insoles, but a slightly thicker heel cushion when compared to the blue Spenco total support insoles. The size 10-11 men's insole fit true to my size eleven Asic running shoes. There was no shifting/sliding at the heel or toe.Cushioning - Despite being slightly thinner than the aforementioned heavy-duty insoles, they are as comfortable while running. This was a very pleasant surprise given the barely adequate cushioning of the blue total support insoles.I would highly recommend these insoles to any casual runner who tends toward the heavier end of the weight spectrum."
4,Better than expected.,"My previous shoes were causing foot pains. Replacing the old soles with these made the shoes feel brand new. The arch support is excellent, although the soles themselves are very large as it could barely fit inside my size 10 men shoes. Heat molding is difficult."
1,Make sure you order the right type!,"I purchased a pair of Spenco Polysorb insoles at a Foot Locker about a year ago and they were great. I thought it was the ""Walker/ Runner"" model but obviously it wasn't because what I received from Amazon was a pair of insoles with good cushioning by the heal but paper-thin material by the toes. Very uncomfortable compared to the the sneakers' original insoles. Unwearable."
3,"Its not good, but its not bad either","I cant really say anything bad about them, but I cant really say anything good either. I bought two pair of these to replace the inserts/soles on 2 pairs of running shoes. Size 10.5 wide New B@l@nce and size 10 S@uc0ny.The problem was I had to trim and trim just to make them fit the 10.5They were a bit too long and a bit too wide, I eventually made them fit, but the biggest issue was the left shoe arch support was killing my foot. It was like I had a stone under the arch support of the insole. I eventually trimmed it down using a razor blade, but after all that energy, I gave up on even trying to make the other pair fit in the S@uc0ny.I returned the one I hadnt cut up and will keep looking. My advice is unless you have really high arches or enjoy cutting up shoe inserts, keep looking.[...] product is made in China"
3,My left foot,well...as soon as i put em on my shoes i feel a good relieve but after one day i started feeling a hard ball below my left foot. I stop using em after 3 days.I dont want to put in the trash this products for other people cause IMO i would go first to the doctor to get a prescription on what kind of insoles exactly i should buy.....but fer so' i dont something wrong on my left foot.
3,High arch is tricky,"I saw other reviews about the arch being high but wasn't too concerned since I have rather high arches myself. It did bother me somewhat though because my feet at 11-1/2 are a little longer than this size so the arch support missed my arch by a 1/2 inch or so and that did take some breaking in.These have otherwise been very good and I think that my recommendation would have been higher were the available sizes more in line with my feet. Barring a big change in their sizing, next time I will get the cross trainers instead, which are reputed to have lower arches."
4,insoles,shipment arrived in good time and was as described. I was pleased with my purchase and they are very comfortable.
3,OK,"At first, I felt really good about this product. After a few times of use, I felt the original insoles are still better. However, it is not a bad product. It is an inexpensive way to fix a pair of shoes."
5,Great product for running and walking.,"The insoles provided in most runnings shoes really don't provide enough cushioning. When you run, 2 -3 times your body weight slams down on your joints. I had shin splints which these help cure. Highly recommended for runners.Though one thing to keep in mind: these are a little thicker than most insoles so you'll have to loosen your laces a tad otherwise your shoe will be too tight.Also, I agree with the previous review about plantar fasciitis. I have this as well. Not a chronic case, but these insoles may only slightly relieve the symptoms. For plantar fasciitis, you need something provides rigid arch support like these:Dr Scholl's Adjustable Arch Pain Relief Orthotics, Men's 8-13, 1-Pair Packages (Pack of 2). I use these in my regular work shoes and it's helping alleviate my PF."
1,NOT a bargain,"Don't be tempted by the price ...since within 6 months I had to buy a replacement for it. This DVD player is of very poor quality, even for a low priced unit. It skips and freezes, the picture is poor, the sound is poor, it is difficult to hook up, especially if you also have a VCR hooked up to the same TV, it responds slowly, if at all, to remote commands, it is just plain buggy....and then it just quits. Oritron does not stand behind their product (for obvious reasons) and offered no help (once I reached anyone). A HUGE waste of time, effort, money and stomach lining. ..."
1,Steer clear,"Got this player as a gift a year ago. I've had freezing problems with this player, sometimes from slightly scratched rental DVDs (which play fine in any other player), and the whole unit locks up (sometimes with garbage displayed on the LED display). When this happens you need to pull the plug, as the power button both on the remote and on the unit itself becomes nonresponsive. Have also had some problems navigating the menus on some discs (""From Hell"" comes to mind.) This player also has problems playing DVD-R discs -- I have had it play RITEKG04 discs fine but sometimes it will freeze or pixellate during playback of DVD-R. Had no luck at all with cheaper Princo or BeAll blanks. Haven't tried DVD+R, it may work better. If you want to use this player as an audio CD player, note that it doesn't play CD-R at all."
1,Do not buy,"I have used this DVD player maybe 15 times, and now it does not play DVDs. I received this as a gift, so luckily I did not pay for it. This is by far the worst piece of electronic equipment ever."
1,Would rate it zero if I could.,"This is a total piece of ... . I went to a rent to own store to rent a DVD player. I originally had a Panasonic RV-30 that had broken and since I was just past the warranty they wanted me to pay to have it fixed. So the rent to own place brought this Oritron dvd player. Brand new. I had it about a week and a half. Played alright with some minor skips, then all of a sudden just froze. Wouldn't turn off, wouldn't eject the movie that I had rented. Fortunately I had not bought this junk at a store, so I took it back to the rent to own place. They said ""This is what they gave you?"" They had to pry the door open with a screwdriver to get the movie out. This is a terrible product. DO NOT BUY THIS THING!!!"
1,Consider Yourself Warned...,if you buy this product then you get Exactly what you deserve...this is a piece of junk... do NOT buy it... I wish I were as smart as anyone reading these reviews BEFORE buying something... I baught this from wal-mart and we were able to watch about 5 or 6 movies on it... then it entered into it's disfunctional state... couldn't turn off... couldn't read a dvd... called oritron support... they sent me a cd to update the bios... did that... and that caused the unit to become totally unresponsive... can't even eject the bios upgrade cd... shame on oritron for puting out a product like this... I will never purchase another oritron product... I won't even take one as a gift... I'll exchange it unopened no matter what it is... oritron is DONE... I could type for another 30 minutes about how angry I am about this... but I'll just end it with... Consider Yourself Warned...
3,Gets the Job Done,"The Oritron performs exactly what it was built for: To play DVD's and music at an average quality level. This is not a high performing device; it's cheaply built. Anyone expecting more from it will be dissapointed. Watching DVD movies is all I do with it, so that is why I didn't spend twice as much on a Sony or Panasonic. The Oritron is smaller and lighter too, giving you more options to place it in various locations through out your house.It has 3x zoom, repeat, disc resume,parental lock, and some other minor features. I have no problems with the player it self, but DVD discs that are very scratched may cause it to freeze up. Just unplug and restart and it may play like a normal disc. If you want better picture quality from this cheap player, get a RCA Monster Cable 2, it will make the picture quality a lot better. I saw it was sharper, brighter and more colorful. Overall, this player has been good to me, and it was a bargin in my opinion."
1,Terrible DVD Player,"The Oritron dvd 100 is a terrible choice. Mine lasted only two years, and I didn't play too many dvd's on it either. Furthermore, after a year, the remote didn't function, and it wouldn't eject half the time.Maybe mine was a bad one, but i doubt it. I do not recommend it. Also, it has no S-Video output."
4,The Homeopathic Childbirth Manual,This is a very easy to read and understand guide to homoeopathy for midwives. I feel very confident as a practitioner following the recommendations made by Betty Idarius. It is very helpful to have the recommended birth kit remedies included. They have been ranked in order of most commonly to least commonly used.
5,More than a Christmas album,"This album is incredible! It is far more than a Christmas album. I listen to it year round. It seems new and fresh with each hearing. In these times, it has a calming and uplifting effect on one's psyche. I highly recommend."
5,"Peace: A Celtic Christmas,","Sheila Walsh is a wonderful singer. if you like Enya you will enjoy Sheila she has a peaceful but powerful voice and this album is just great.The songs just give me shivers when I here them she did a wonderful job in recording the album. the instrument are of a old period of time and so are the songs. Their are some traditional Christmas songs but for the most part the songs are different. I even think she wrote some of the songs. This is a great album for anybody who love Christmas music. She has a Choir and Orchestra joining here as well as some instrument that sound from the baroque age. Very well done. I would be nice if the record company would re-reissue this album.Sincerely, Jason or Peter Pielak."
2,The worst database book,"This is a very wordy and messy book. Very simple things came out to be pages and pages of words. So many pages, just waste your time, also your money! I think it only need 300 pages for the whole things he talked about. Some points were repeated again and again! We do not need a Ph.D paper, just need a useful reference. This is 5-stars for Ph.D paper writing, not for text book and other use. By the way, the first 5 chapters are very good."
5,A great way for kids to learn Mandarin,"This product is definitely one of the best out there right now for learning Mandarin chinese. My 2 girls (age 4 & 6) love watching the video and actually interact with the characters out loud. They also ask to watch it over and over because the story is amusing and they enjoy singing the very catchy songs. The story introduces just the right number of new Mandarin words/phrases and my kids have picked up on them very quickly. Thankfully, the book and the flashcards have the pinyin pronunciation written for the adults to be able to review the words that were introduced in the video. We have also been playing memory game with the flashcards that are included to introduce the written Chinese language as well. If you really want your child(-ren) to learn some Mandarin, while having fun, then this video/flashcard/book kit is for you."
2,disappointed,The price is $49.95 and I got only 1 CD? Duh!!The Chinese words in the CD & books are so simple -- you can learn it from Nie Hao Kailan.Not recommended - if you want to learn chinese languages pls go to your nearest Library. There are tons of how to learn Mandarins books!
2,not good for native chinese speaking child,"this product is probably good for teaching english speaking child chinese, but definitely not for a child who already understands chinese.we bought this thinking to give our daughter (16mos old) an alternative dvd movie to watch that's all in chinese. the description said it's in english and chinese, and we thought we'd have the option to choose the language. what we got was each phrase spoken in english, then followed in chinese. maybe there was a storyline to it, but we skipped through each chapter and didn't notice any storyline. the making dumpling chapter was mostly in english.we ended up returning the product, not what we were looking for."
2,WAY over-priced!!,This was a nice 30 minute video and the extra resources are great. But for $50 I was expecting more than a single episode! My 9 and 12 year old sons enjoyed it and we'll watch it a few more times and practice with the flash cards. BUT this was way over-priced!!!!
3,"Short, cute show.","I bought this for my young son. We live in Hawaii and my husband is part Chinese. This is a short, cute show, but you will not learn Chinese from this! I've learned that if you really want your child to learn Mandarin, you really need to send them to class."
1,Not for serious learner,"The whole DVD teaches about 40 very basic words, my 4 year old can learn all that in half day. If you are looking for a movie for your kid, or learn a few words for fun, that's ok, the book and DVD are in good quality. If you want your kid to lean Chinese seriously, go find something else. $50 for 40 words? It's not worthy."
4,Discovery of the Source of the Nile,An interesting travel back in time. Interesting how little Africa seems to have changed in 150 years. Would loved to have had a map readable on the Kindle to follow Speke's progress.
2,CDs are a mixed bag but DVD is just horrible,"What can I say, this is one strange package. The DVD has a short biography of Tchaikovsky which is okay but it then reverts to a biographical ballet which places an overwhelming amount of emphasis on the composers sexuality. Tchaikovsky was a great composer. Who cares about his sexuality more than 100 years later? Give me a break. The two CDs have one exceptional performance, Vladimir Spivakov playing the violin concerto. His tone is huge, his phrasing breathtaking and the performance has real fire. The short pieces are also done quite well. The ballet excerpts have really poor sound and dull performances. Finally, there is Derek Han playing the 1st Piano Concerto. It is okay but this is not Mr. Han's speciality. He is a world famous Mozartian and deservedly so. Here his playing is labored and not very passionate. Unless you think is a real bargain, I would avoid this DVD/CD combination."
1,Public Domain Material,"This material is in the public domain as it was developed by the US government with tax dollars. Don't be fooled into paying for it. Just search for ""fsi language courses""."
1,EEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWW,"I cant belive SOAD came out with this cd. Toxicity was 1000000000000000000000000000 times better than this. These songs end up being annoying and do not show SOADs real talent. If you see this cd, run away as far and fast as you can."
3,I like this band,I like this band and their uniques stylemy only gripe is that BANDS NEED TO STAY AWAY FROM POLITICS!!Is there anyone here who goes to a concert to hear a political message? NO! NO ONE CARES!
1,To much anti-war junk,"I will say SOAD has a few good songs, but so does every other band. The problem is the anti-war, anti-american lyrics. I really don't know where they are from, but if they are from the USA they should know that war gives them the freedom to spout that garbage. If they are not then SHUT YOUR F**KING MOUTH. I would never buy their albums, but they must have a few like minded people to support their lacking efforts."
1,CD makes for a good coaster for your drink,"Well, I had to give it a one because it won't let me rate it as a zero or negative number. This band proves that you do not have to have musical talent to make a cd! There are maybe a couple of songs that are slow paced, but even they aren't very good. If you like fast paced music with nothing but screaming and yelling, then this album is for you. Otherwise my advice would be to operate several pieces of large equipment (such as saws, drills, sanders, etc.) for a more pleasant listening experience."
5,My favorite SOAD album,"I own every album of System of a Down, and when Hypnotize came out, I didn't understand why they didn't release more material like this. I also don't understand why they still broadcast songs from Toxicity and not this album. I love every song on this album because of the diversity. Of course it surrounds metal, but you never get the feeling it's going to be the same. Although I'm a big fan of Disturbed, these guys know how to make you wonder what's coming at you. I think songs like Streamline and IEAIAIO and Mr. Jack should be on the radio, or something, because this album shows (from what I think) their potential. Mezmerize and Steal this Album are my favorites. You may want to try Toxicity to get the style first though."
3,Good news for SOAD fans....,"System of a Down will be releasing 2 full length cds in 2005. the first one will be called Hypnotize, which will be released in March. the second one will be called Mesmerized and will be released later in the year. The long awaited follow-up to Toxicity is almost over. And now for the review, this cd is ok it could've been better I ecpecially like the first half of the cd and the rest is just ok. I don't own this album (thats right I stole it) and I'm glad I did because I normally listen to there self-titled cd than any of there albums."
3,Hmm....,"Well, quite a disappointment. It is a good Cd, but nothing compared to Toxicity. They went to hard this time. I just bought it, but, frankly, I'm wishing I bought the Squarepusher album instead. If you are a big fan of System of a Down, then its worth it. But, if you are just a casual listener, don't bother.The only good track in my opinion is the 16th, Streamline. If you want that, then just buy the Scorpion King Soundtrack, which is excellent."
4,I Stole this Album,"SOAD number 3 is just as consistent and dynamic as ever, it just doesn't hold up to the classics on the other cds. Political lyrics are at their best here on Boom, F the System, and ADD while Innervision, Streamline, and Ego Brain give you a little more melody with your music. 36 is a rapid, ultrashort commentary while Mr. Jack is creepy and humorous. The other songs are good, mixing metal and clean riffs/melodies that variate the music, but again no real standouts, except Roulette, which is entirely acoustic. Best song is Chic N Stu, the epitome of randomness even over some of the other songs on this album. Buy it if you like System. Steal it if you don't."
3,Quite Average...,"System Of A Down were in a pickle around the time this album came out. Their B-side collection, in its raw form, was being passed around the Net like hotcakes on a December morning. Rather than pull a Metallica, and cause trouble for downloaders, SOAD decided to remaster the B-sides and add backup singing, piano, or whatever else was needed to make them sound professional.And that's what this is. A B-side collection. It seems as though most are half-baked political diatribes, and so the album has a political feel. However, it's just odds and ends. Don't expect another Toxicity. We'll have to wait for that...""Innervision,"" ""Thetawaves,"" ""Nuguns,"" ""Mr. Jack,"" ""IEAIAIO,"" and ""Roulette"" are still pretty good, but the filler keeps this disc out of my player most days."
5,crazy stuff,"The new System Of a Down cd is there 3rd main CD. It was released in late November without much publicity. Songs like ""Chik 'n' Stu"" are strange but good and make you think. Roulette and Streamline are a little calmer than usual but have a rock edge. It's definitely a change from toxicity and you can see the band growing and creating a new style but keeping with the same theme. I think that all the songs have a message and Serj is probably the only one that can fully explain them. Get the CD its worth it, all of their CD's are."
4,DO Steal This Album...or buy it. Whatever.,"In the absence of Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down is settling into the still-warm ""Mainstream Political Band"" seat. Songs like ""Boom!"", ""NuGuns"", ""A.D.D. (American Dream Disorder)"", and ""F**k The System"" fill the album with burning questions about the rationale of the American political stance, while ""Inner Vision"", ""Mr. Jack"", and, my favorite, ""Roulette"" fill out the album with texture and depth to spare for three albums. Serj and Daron's vocals are a force to be reckoned with, whether they are screaming at the top of their lungs or wailing melodically. Pack that together with powerful bass riffs, the typical but occasionally playful metal guitarist, and hard hitting rhythm, and you have one heck of an album. Not the greatest rock album out there, but ""Steal This Album"" is definitely solid."
4,"""Steal this Album"" CD Review","This CD mastered many qualities of that of a CD rating five stars, but some songs had lyrics that had no meaning and were merely using words for rhythmical value. All song titles related well to the topics, but many songs lacked a good consistent beat, and had some incomprehensible and not thoughtful lyrics. These faults contributed to the reason I rated it as a four star instead of a five star album. This CD overall had an excellent flowing beat and good related titles for each song. The new album for the band System of a Down, ""Steal this Album"" is an upgrade from their last album, ""Toxicity"" because it had a more understandable tone, and clearer lyrics. On a personal note, I really enjoyed this new release, and I think it is an above average CD."
5,Their best,"I think ""Steal This Album"" is their best album. I do not generally agree with their messages, but Serg's vocals are at their best and the music is just as good as before. If you like System of a Down, you will like this more."
2,Not as good as it should be,"SOAD has displayed excellent potential in TOXICITY where practically all the songs kicked [bottom].. However STEAL THIS ALBUM is definately not worth your money.. The best songs on it are F**K THE SYSTEM, INNERVISION and STREAMLINE.. The other songs are mostly horrible..N.B I am not hating on SOAD i am actually a fan of theirs.. (JUST BEING HONEST)"
2,"Wow, System of a down has lost it.","As a long time System of a Down fan, I'd have to say this album would be considered mediocre. The songs are, let me put this in a way for understanding.. Retarted. The lyrics for -most- not all songs are just plain stupid and make no sense. Lyrics from Chick 'N' Stu ... ""This ballgames in the refrigerator. The door closed. The lights are out. And the butters getting hard"" What the hell is that about? Can someone explain? The is obviously the WORST System of a Down album ever made so far. If your sick of this crap nu-metal has turned into, check out System of a Down's first self-titled album. It's their outward most best album. Instead of listening to crap. Theirs only select few songs that are good on ""Steal this album!""."
1,This is the worst cd this year and probably for next year,this cd is terrible the music in the cd isn't the same i never really tried to pay any attention to his voice i tried to avoid it the first cd in my opinion is the best the second cd is the 2nd best and this one is just bad.
1,"As good as listening to Rush Limbaugh, only left-wing","I saw these guys during Ozzfest 1998, back when they were trying to get big. I couldn't deal with the singer's histrionic screaming then, and I still can't deal with it now.It's bad enough that the lyrics make no sense that Serj has to go on political tirades in virtually every single song. I'm not bashing on the Democratic party by any means, but this is not the way to draw people to the left wing of politics.Why? Because I can't take them seriously enough when they insist on singing about a pizza (""Chick 'n' Stu"") or screaming about the politics of war with phrases like ""death showers"" (""Boom!""). That's why all of their albums, this one in particular, are unlistenable in my opinion.The masters of politics in music are still U2, people who can draw fans of all walks of life without having to rant and rave and pontificate pointlessly about liberalism. System of a Down just doesn't do it for me."
1,outtakes for a reason.,"If you didn't know the reason for the title of this album ""steal this album"" is because these outtakes from the toxicity session where stolen and placed on the Internet (um-mixed or mastered) over 6 months ago..now with that in mind this is the reason the band does not care about this album is because the songs are non-album material, so don't be fooled into thinking this is a new system of a down album THIS IS NOT..take the bands advice and download this album"
5,Systems B sides album,"This album is a composition of B sides, from 1995-2001. This album is everything you expect from the LA based Armeinan metal group, but is missing quite a few B side songs including:1: Metro (a Berlin cover)2: Snowblind (a Black Sabbath cover)3: Blue4: Dam5: Johnny (Really weird great song)6: Shame (a compilation cover with Wu Tang)7: Legend of Zelda (Yes, a nintendo game cover)Innervision was the first single on this album. Produced by Rick Rubin, who is one of the best producers ever, and Daron Malakin, (lead guitarist). These songs were revamped from originals after Daron was mad that B sides were being shared online, and sounding terrible. Remixed and produced, this album of 16 tracks proves to be a little hint where System is going musically. There are at least four different ""covers"" for this album...It's worth every cent!"
5,ABSOLUTLY INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the most unbelivable CD i have ever listened to. even if you are not a S.O.A.D. fan you will enjoy this! The song Roulette is absolutly breathtaking and as another fan said ""you just dont want it to stop."" I just can't belive music can be this good."
5,...,"This is definitely one of the best albums of 2002. I've always been a fan of these kind of 'rarities' albums, and Steal This Album is no exception. Lots of very powerful songs, but also with driving melodies and captivating lyrics. The singles, ""Innervision"" and ""Boom!"", are excellent selections, and if you've heard them, you'll probably agree. But, as always, the best tracks are never released on the radio (it's an effective psychological gimmick that I won't go into here); the real beauty lies on the CD, in songs like ""Mr. Jack"", ""Roulette"", ""A.D.D. (American Dream Disorder)"", and my personal favorite, ""I-E-A-I-A-I-O"", which I think is the world's best way to get a crowd riled up. This is a definite must-buy for music fans."
4,*blink*,"I like this CD for the most part, but its an assult on your senses. The speed hardly ever stops the whole way through the CD, I think they could do a little better if they make their songs a bit deeper and longer."
4,New Political Strategy,"I think System's philosophy is quite shrewd. Get out as much political music as you can, as fast as you can--with enough grooves and hooks to keep 'em coming back. One powerful song may not do as much good as three albums filled with common rants.If you listen to System you get mad at the system. Get people listening to System, buying new System, and minds will change from repetition and continual exposure to radical ideas. One NPR Alternative Radio lecture may make your blood boil... five may get you writing letters and checks... ten may make you change political parties. SOAD keeps cranking them out, too, across Radio Purchased America.Will this strategy work? Let's listen to what's playing at the next WTO anarchist fair."
5,steal this album,"In my opinion, this is their best album ever!Every track (16) was created to perfect their sound...I have all their albums but this 1 ROCKSFav tracks:2- Innervision5- Nuguns8- I-E-A-I-A-I-O10- Pictures11- Highway Song16- Streamline"
2,"I wouldn't ""STEAL THIS ALBUM"" if I could get away with it","This album is incredibly sub-par for SOAD. I am a huge System of a Down fan from their self-titled and Toxicity stayed in my stereo for months, so I know what I am saying here. No effort was put into this album. Horrible cover-art and repetitive songs are just some things to expect when you buy this very expensive frisbee. Decent tracks include: F The System, Innervision and Boom. I was hoping that they would include ""Johnny"", one of the unreleased tracks that leaked to the Internet. All in all, this album doesnt include impressive vocal range and excellent musicianship like Toxicity did. I would say ""Toxicity"" is to Metallica's ""Black Album"" or ""Master of Puppets"" as ""Steal This Album"" is to Metallica's ""Load"" or ""Reload"". Yes, its that bad."
4,This one is pretty good.,"This album, is not as good as SOAD's previous release, Toxicity. The album has a good number of good songs, yet there are a couple ones that just arnt good and detract to the quality of the cd as a whole. They use middle eastern style instruments in a couple of the tracks, which is very cool. Another problem is that this album is chalk full of leftist veiws, way too much. Im not opposed to their views I just think too many in an album detract from the song writing. Their last album had the perfect amount of political views mixed with other inspirational songs. I think they went a little overboard on this one. If you do not have toxicity yet, buy that first. Then look at this one. Its a good cd, dont get me wrong. So if you like soad im sure you will like this cd. Its just not as good as the last. I would of also liked system of a down go a little more hardcore but oh well. Buy it. Or steal it."
4,damn good,"incredible cd, really political... lots of cool anti-capitalist stuff, the title being a prime example! most of the songs are about the level of most of the songs on toxicity, but there are some (like thetawaves and roulette) that kick...!!! a must have... but u don't need to buy it it has no burn protection!!"
2,There's A Reason Most Of These Songs Didn't Make It On An Al,"System of a Down is probably the best rock band out right now. Their self-titled debut was a weird yet amazing glimpse of rock excellence. The follow-up 'Toxicity' was the best album released last year. This ""new"" album that features tracks that were left on the cutting room floor, but released because of internet leaks and downloading. This album is the worst they have realesed by far. There are a few songs that keep this album from getting zero stars such as ""A.D.D."", ""Mr. Jack"", ""Pictures"", ""Roulette"", and ""Streamline"". Although those 5 standout tracks are excellent songs, the other songs are just so horrible that it practically ruins this album. ""Mr. Jack"" and ""Roulette"" (an acoustic song) are masterpieces, and even though I gave this album a bad rating, are reasons alone to get this album."
2,B-tracks for a reason.....I wouldnt steal this CD,"I have bought all of SOAD's cds, and this just doesnt do it for me. I didnt realy like their first, but I like Toxicity. This cd is basically tracks they left off of Toxicity, and I think they left them off for a reason. These tracks are just too pop and soft, and not enough metal. They come across weird, and boring."
2,"""kiss of death for system of a down""","This album is a dissapointment for me and many other system of a down fans I know. This c.d. has some good songs like ""Inner Visons"" and ""Boom"", but most of the other songs just sound like they ran out of scraps for the c.d. I will say it is about the same as their first self titled album, but it isn't even close to the previous ""Toxicity"" or it's predecessor ""Mezmerize"". When this c.d. first came out I thought it would be S.O.A.D's last c.d. and that they had reached the end of their career. This wouldn't be a good c.d. to let someone listen to who has never heard S.O.A.D. before.this is mainly just something for true S.O.A.D. fans. If you were going to introduce somebody to S.O.A.D., use ""Toxicity""or ""Mezmerize""."
5,"So good, you don't have to steal it!","Technically, I didn't buy this C.D. but i downloaded the songs. Don't let the cover of the album or the name of the album fool you.The songs as really good, rivaling the songs from Toxicity. I especially liked Chic 'N' Stu, A.D.D., and Ego Brain. A must have for any System of a Down fan!"
5,Great followup to first self-titled CD and Toxicity,"Get ""Steal This Album"" now! It is a great followup to System of a Down's first self-titled album and their second album ""Toxicity"". All of these songs are great, especially Streamline, ...the System, and Innervision. Definetely get this album if you liked either of the first two albums."
3,Not there greatist...,This album definitly is not there best work. Toxicity and there first album were great. This one they change in style and there lyrics are in a lot of songs quite ridiculous. like for example in chic n stu serj is singing about pizza toppings.I suggest to a new system of a down fan to buy Toxicity or there first album. They don't have the strong melodic metal style any more it seems. This album is far from bad but its nothing like there previous releases.
3,Toxicity Volume 2,"Did you remember the feeling when you listened to Metallica's 'Reload' album for the first time? It was pretty much like listening to their last bad album from the previous year. Well, this is the same scenario: every song sounds like it would fit on Toxicity, and vice versa. There hasn't been one change at all within the band, and their annoying sound is actually getting too much to bear. While it does contain some good songs, including 'I-E-A-I-A-I-O' and 'Streamline,' the rest of the album fails to let you know when songs change."
4,4 Stars cuz it's SOAD,"I find Steal This Album to be a really boring cd. There's about 5 good songs on here, which would be (from best to worst) ADD, Boom!, I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Chic 'N' Stu and Innervision.The rest isn't really innovative at all and it's lost the creative touch found on the band's first cd. There's nothing close to Sugar on here.This would probably be system of a down's worst cd not only because of the lack of good songs but the lack of originality. ""SOAD"" had Sugar. ""Toxicity"" had Prison Song. ""Mezmerize"" had BYOB. But there's nothing creative on here to keep me coming back, if you take out the 5 songs I mentioned I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between any of the remaining songs except the terrible ""36"".The only reason I'd get this is to complete my S.O.A.D. collection. Get Mezmerize, Toxicity OR THE GREATEST ALBUM ON EARTH, ""SYSTEM OF A DOWN"" [self titled]. These guys have potential and they didn't use it here I'm sorry."
2,not toxicity...,"I dont understand the glowing 5 star reviews. Toxicity was a breath of fresh rock air, and I usually dont get into metal. Toxicity was smart, fresh and tight. Steal this Album isnt any of those. I would describe it as unworked, musical half-thoughts. Unless you are obsessed with everything these guys do, dont waste money on this. So yeah, maybe steal it, but dont blow any cash on it."
5,"Crazy, Loud, and Powerfull beyond belief","Wow, System Of A Down really blows me away with their powerfull guitars and bass and their awesome fast drummer and their crazy vocalist. This is some great stuff to jump around and bang your head to. I really like the pizza pie song, really nice. This band is talented and forcefull, and is some excellent heavy metal, and it's really taking rock music to a whole new level. It really amazes me, I've always been a fan of System Of A Down, and I've always loved their heavy music. All of their songs on hear are good, and I just love listening to it. I also highly reccomend checking out all of their other ablums as well."
3,"I love this band, but....","...this album seems to lacking what the first two had.Don't get me wrong, there are some truly amazing songs, such as streamline for example, but what destroys this record i sthe over production. Serj's voice is as usual, phenomenal, but is ruined by the guitarists constant backing vocals. He whines like a little girl. Why doesn't someone tell him, this??OK, he writes all the songs, but there is no need to put listeners in such pain.Most of this record was originally leaked on the internet. If you can find those versions, burn those to a cd instead. No annoying backups can be found on any of them....but still, some great songs. I just hope the next one isn't so polished."
4,No Question! The ULTIMATE System of a Down CD - EVER!,"I bought this album and I couldn't wait to get it. When I did I realized that System of a Down, my favorite band, was way better then I thought! The tracks are political, like Toxicity, which is what I like because I'm way into speaking my mind...This was a good album! BUY,BUY,BUY!"
4,Great stuff,"This is a great cd. Its stuff that SOAD thought just didt flow well into Toxicity, and they released it because they wanted there fans to hear all the stuff mixed so it didnt sound liek ... Its good stuff, check it ot."
2,"Sounds great, but the lyrics ...","I love System Of A Down! I have loved every single thing that they have ever done. So I was really excited when I got ... This Album. I listened to the whole CD and it sounded like normal System Of A Down, but I could not understand some of the lyrics like always will Systems' songs. So I read the lyrics on the internet and I was so depressed because the lyrics [were not good] On every single song the say the same thing three or four times, most of the songs only have two or three parts! ..."
4,"A review of System of a Down's ""Steal This Album"" cd.","System of a Down's ""Toxicity"" album is one of my alltime favorites. And while ""Steal This Album"" is a good, memorable cd in its own right, it just isn't quite as exceptionally great as its predecessor was. A couple of tracks on STA really stand out as especially awesome. ""Mr. Jack"" is a slow-to-fast masterpiece that rivals that of ""Chop Suey"" or ""Toxicity"" and ""Roulette"" is a brillant acoustic work that shows that SOAD can be more than up and down chaos. Other very cool parts of this album, such as the chanting chorus of ""I-A-E-I-A-O"" and the nonsensical shouting of ""Chic N' Stew"" more then make STA a recommended purchase. It's a good, at times great, work of ""artistic"" music, that just ends up falling short of ""Toxicity"" itself."
2,Chicagoan no longer looking to Chicago Magazine,"Chicago magazine was once a wonderful resource to me as a Chicagoan...but not now. Hip, savy and younger (25-40) is no longer the target audience. For over two years this magazine was my main resource for learning about, events, restaraunts, clubs, openings. Now, this magazine is just a glorified version of the Chicago Tribune...it's owners. both the magazine and the paper will have the same information for ""hot new clubs"", ""great eats"", 10 things to do under $40. It's a rip off for those of us that live here and those traveling here. But even worse it tends to focus on the suburbs. If Chicago wasn't a thriving, wonderful city...no one would want to live here."
3,Almost worth the $12 a year,"Useful for specific purposes: Restaurant ratings and reviews, ""Top XX whatevers"" etc. Just don't pay more than $12 a year, the ""rack rate"" the publisher offers."
3,"Like New York Magazine, not the New Yorker","Like so many magazines that have decided to pursue the relatively affluent core of their subscription, Chicago magazine is great if you want to read a magazine to figure out what to buy. It's got lots of articles that are relevant to you if you're upwardly mobile, either live in the suburbs or have a car to get there, and are interested in the latest trends in entertainment and shopping.That said, it's just not what I look for in a magazine. I've read many issues and while the writing is pretty good, I've never found an article that I thought was worth saving, or even much that told me something I didn't know about Chicago, and I've only lived here a few years. Don't be fooled by the title -- this magazine is fine for what it is, but it doesn't even come close to covering Chicago."
1,Promotes The National Image of Tribune Liberal Bias,"The magazine hit a new low recently but is in lockstep with the media bias demomstrated so wonderfully by the Chicago Tribune.The story tracking a particular pistols travel from manufacturerto the streets of Chicago exhibit the typical reporters attemptto shape public opinion to their viewpoint. Stories such as theseare shining examples of how America's public is slowly brainwashed into believing what the reporters portray in a one sided story. America, the firearm issue is the biggest cover-up since the JFK assassination. If you disbelieve what I've just stated your already brainwashed."
3,"Okay, but very predictable","It took only about a fourth of this book to effectively guess the ending. But at least it was enjoyable enough to continue on to confirm my beliefs. It reads a bit too chatty, but it does hold together. Nice first try, but, when it comes to White House mysteries, Susan is no Elliott Roosevelt and the First Daughter is no Eleanor Roosevelt."
3,Not for the beginner,"The beginning of the book was great, but it got a tad difficult after that.This is not a book for the beginner, but for the one who already knows the basics and is ready for a first year college-level Greek book."
3,Not What You Might Think,"I bought this book believing it to be, as the synopsis says, a ""workbook is for the one who may not have either the time or the opportunity for a formal, college-level Greek course. As an introduction to Greek, it is also valuable preparation for a standard academic course.""Well, not exactly. It's a workbook for learning the New Testament in Greek. If that's what you're looking for, it may be fine, but it isn't as described. (The 3 stars are irrelevant; I didn't read it. Hey, Amazon, how about a ""not applicable"" for the number of stars?)"
4,Great book to start with,Found's book is the best book I have seen to begin the study of Greek. I have had two years of Master's Degree level Greek and am currently teaching beginning Greek live over the Internet using Found's book. It is a good way to review or get started in the study of Koine Greek.
4,Is this the same cd every one else is reviewing?,"holy sh*t this album is great! How could you NOT like this? Baby is one of the most unique sounding lyricists out now... he does need to talk about different subjects now and then but this is light rap hes not trying to act gangsta in every song. I was very pleased with this album especially the fact that this album has 17 songs (and 5 skits). Out of those 17 songs only 1 or 2 is less than 4/5. The best songs are Fly In Any Weather, Never Had Nothin', What Happened To That Boy?, How It Be, and Do That... I give props to Baby for bringin his game strong to this album... definately worth the money."
1,I aint trying to here it,"I really ain't trying to hear this album. I already know its whack cause number 1, do that dance, and what happened to that boy is not very good songs. and number 2, all the tracks talk about being a bird and flying in the sky. I know it's stupid. I bet he talks about being a stunna and a bird on the whole album. I'm not going to waste my time with this one. Baby really isn't a diverse rapper as u already know. On ever song u can just guess what he's gonna say next. 8 times out o ten u might be right."
1,One of the worst ever!!!!,"This cd is so horrible,I can't even describe it.I'll admit,I even used to be a fan of Ca$h Money records,until I heard ""Do That Dance"",the most pathetic excuse for a song ever.This guy couldn't rhyme if his life depended on it.Even worse,the song i just mentioned also happens to feature the incredibly awful P.Diddy.This guy seems to be incredibly obsessed with bird noises.It gets on your nerves until you can't take it anymore.Save your money and spend it anywhere else."
1,"Nice cover, ugly album","This album went to show me, never judge a book by it's cover. The cover looked great but on the inside, pure garbage. Without Turk, Juvinile and B.G., cash money is suverly strugling to produce good songs anymore. And Birdman, anin't that a comic book hero or somethin? Well Baby, u sure as hell ain't any kind of hero to hip-hop, ur a discrace with this garbage. Cash Money has been strugling so much, they reliy solo projects from a fool who think he can acualluy diss someone, Lil Wayne, and someone who thinks he's so big, baby. Well sooner or later, cash money is gonna collapse, and the Big Tymers will be the old-timers, and Baby aka the #1 stunna will be back to hustling the street; and son't think manny Fresh is gonna come thru 4 them. And word to cash money, quit and retire while ur still rich, cuz u can't carry ur own burden; the ones who left were the only ones who could. Sad"
2,decent solo debut,"First of all,the lyrics on this album are forgettable.The only good songs are What Happened To That Boy ft. Clipse,Heads Up ft. D Boys,and Never Had Nuthin.Overall this is not a very good album because of the absence of the Hot Boys."
1,same ol same ol,this album is very original. i didn't know they liked bling bling so much. please tell me more about your ice and cars mr birdman.
2,Not up to par w/previous recordings,This si disappointing. In no way were these beats as goods as those that cash money usually drops. This album is not like the other stuntastic beats they make. Nothing about this album is ballerific
1,GREAT... not...,"This CD is pitiful. Simple as that, Baby is one of the worst rappers ever. The only song that's almost listenable to is What Happened To That Boy. If you want some real rap go buy any Tupac CD. He is the absolute best rapper ever."
3,cash money is losing it,"birdman steps up front since juve's gone and the line up now includes teena marie, tq, boo and gotti, and jazze pha and the guest stars on here does'nt make it cd of the year but it's nice to bump some of these songs in the club."
4,Birdman!!! Solo?,"This CD is really kickin. When my (non-rap-fan)friends look at the CD cover, they wonder why i bought it, but I have pile of respect for Baby. This CD probably has too many guest appearances than it needs, but that IS a good thing. I love how it be, never had nothin', ice cold and i don't ever have to press skip. This solo debut is one of the best i've ever heard, and it isn't easy to make an album after you've been workin with Manny Fresh. I would have given Baby's CD 5 stars if he didn't include all of those bird noises. BIG UPS TO CASHMONEY!!!YOU HAVE MY RESPECTZZZZZ!!!"
1,this is garbage this is crap,i would of gave it 0 stars.because cd is not worth listening to.i rather bump big tymers hood rich.this is garbage dont cop this .if somebody gave you a copy of this cd throw it away .if you have a copy of it throw it away.now i'll give it no stars sould'nt never droped in stores in the first place.
2,What happened,"This cd was terrible, don't buy it unless u find it used for a good price, theres mabye 3 good songs. My biggest complaint is Jazzy Phae that dude should never ever sing he's horrible and I think he ruins half the songs on the album, dont waste ur money.I give this a 2, only because it had potential."
1,I can't believe I bought this CD,"This is the Wackest CD I've bought this year....And I buy a lot of them..The Birdman has got to go. All that Squawking going on, and enough about your money..WE ALL KNOW YOU GOT MONEY OR YOU WOULNDN'T HAVE A CD OUT. Tell us a story be original..But not Birdman Original. I couldn't even get through this Whole CD...I tried to sell it for 5 dollars and couldn't get it sold. I'll be trading it in as soon as possible...He needs to stick with Mannie and have someone tell him when the beat is wack"
2,The Birdman needs to fly away from the hip-hop scene....,"As much as it PAINS me to talk down on this album, I'm left with no other option. I TRIED to like this album and give Baby (aka #1 Stunna) the benefit on the doubt, but it just wasn't happening. The ""22 Track"" album is filled with a bunch of non-sense skits (5 of them if I remember correctly), and a bunch of wack filler. The only cut I liked from this record was the collabo with Clipse on the Neptune's-produced ""What Happened to That Boy."" ""Do That"" featuring P. Diddy was a decent track but it only sounds good in the clubs...other than that, the rest of the album just doesn't ""fly"" with me. Yo Baby, stick with your crew dogg...you suck on your own."
3,Itz ok to stunt but dayum......,"CA$H MONEY tight but dey fell off when B.G. an JUVE left. all dis rap'n bout money aint called fo. datz not wha da rap game is all bout. itz bout talent. rap'n bout how much money u have aint talent, to me itz brag'n. if dat was da case den BILL GATES should make an album he got mo money den all yall put togetha. enough is enough. im sick of hear'n bout all da ice an ridez dey have. rap bout street life (da thangz u been thru grow'n up). we all know yall got money so u aint gotta remind us in every song u make. itz like u repeat'n yo self jus to different beatz. sometimez the beatz even sound the same. come on now yall change up yo style we know yall down in da dirty stun'n. but dayum give me a break. u dont see all da otha rappaz talm bout how much money dey got. dey eitha talk bout the past or the present strugglez dey have encountered."
3,it's alright,"Ever since Juvy and B.G Left i thought that cash money will be sorry but since they have mack-10 he is alright but i really love the Hot Boys that was another major differnces in cash money like Juvy all is alubms really took off (400 Degrezz & The G-code) but as foe the rest like Big Tymers, Turk, Mack 10 and others they are alright"
1,What Happened To That Boy??,"I do not like this album at all. I had it for a very long time, but never listened to it until now. This album constantly reminds us that he is riding on chromed out 24's and sporting Gucci and Burberry. This sucks like a hickey. There is only one song that I like. That's 1 out of 22 tracks, and I feel that deserves a failing grade."
5,how can u say dat diz iz a bad cd?,Ok diz is da crunkest cd!I luv da birdman he is so great but ne-ways for hemant who wrote dat diz was a bad cd he can go ahead and go somewhere for dat. Diz cd is da best and I have it. #1 stunna and p.Diddy make good music ok so.... Yeh I think him and Mannie Fresh gon come back together and make sum more crunk songz becuz STILL FLY wuz da bomb. Aight den let me get up outta here. Lyke da birdman says GO AHEAD AND DO THAT!
5,Great album,This CD is off the hook. Baby and company have done it again. 5 mics and well worth buying.
1,bling bling?,"how the f- did cash money even become a record label. they're only hot artist was juvy, and he got smart and left. i think by now we all know they drive bentley's and f- b****es. we need to hear no more of how much money them faggots have. if you think the rap game is all about money buy this album"
2,Too much birdcalling,"You have to admit that the birdcalls are getting kind of old now. This is the typical Cash Money CD, filled with songs about money, ice, and all the other superficial things life has to offer. There isn't anything special about this CD and don't expect anything profound in terms of the lyrics. There are a couple of catchy songs on here, such as the first single ""Do That"" and the song that features Toni Braxton. But other than that, you wouldn't be missing anything by leaving this CD on the shelf."
5,This CD would become a hit if it received air-time,There nothing on this CD that I do not like. I bought the CD and the cassette. I think that it is a shame the people in northern cities have to go to the southern cities to find music as good as the CD Memories. When people hear me play it they ask who is it then they go try to buy it and can't find it anywhere. I am looking forward to the next CD and hope that you will list it. That's how I was able to purchase Memories.
3,"Good information, poorly written","I have Asperger's Syndrome and was struggling with integrating into the workplace. This book provided a lot of great insight and information, and helped me see how to more effectively operate in a corporate business environment. The book is poorly written, however, as if the writer did it in one draft without the help of an editor. Grammar and sentence structure are often awkward. But I still recommend the book, especially since there aren't many AS books out there for business professionals (most are for dealing with AS children)."
1,Useless for Real Aspies,"Mildly interesting autobiographical sketch of someone possibly with mild Aspergers dealing with the business world. Same sort of general advice as other business success books but little practical application. Definitely needs far more detail to be useful for Aspies. Very thin book, grossly overpriced since you can get better info free on the Web.For Aspie, as well as neurotypical, readers, I recommend Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People instead."
2,should have bigger forced air fan,"Cadet #67507 2000W Wall Fan HeaterPlenty of heat, wish the forced air fan was bigger. If I were to buy one again I think I would have gone with the next size bigger from Cadet. I have one in my family room and love it, this one just doesn't blow the hot air. I worry about it over-heating."
1,STUPID PEOPLE,NEVER order from this company Kathy & Dennys THREE TIMES I gave them the right address THREE TIMES they mailed it to the wrong one. NOT even the right state. As far as heater goes who knows never got it...
4,Welcome Return,"Kings X took a break from their melodic side with their past few efforts...They are back to ""old form"" with Ogre Tones. This is not to say that I would rank this with ""Gretchen Goes To Nebraska"" or ""Faith , Hope & Love"" , but it is an excellent CD.Ty Tabor's beatlesque vocals once again comliment Doug Pinnick's funk/r&b; rhythms...Standout tracks include ""If"", ""Mudd"",""Sooner or Later"" and ""Alone""....I recommend fans of early Kings X to buy this one!"
5,More great music from the boys,"It really is amazing how a group can consistantly write great songs over and over. Sure there's a few songs in the catalog that I dont care for but overall kings x really gives you your moneys worth.This release reminds me alot of the older king's releases before my favorite Dogman. Alot of harmonys and melody. I would have liked it to be more ""rocking"" so to speak but it's hard to drop any points for that because it does rock and have alot of layers and textures. Is it crushing like Dogman? No but this is worth every penny and you also get a video :)"
4,Heading back in the right direction,"After a couple of questionable CD's (Manic Moonlight especially), I almost didn't buy this one. Based on a good review in ""The Phantom Tollbooth"", I went ahead and got the CD and was glad I did. Probably the band's best original effort since ""Tape Head"". 'Alone' is a great tune, as is 'Honesty'. Although another reviewer stated that 'Freedom' was a re-release, I was unaware of it (and I have virtually their whole original catalog). GREAT TUNE. The only disappointment was Doug crossing the line and using profanity in one of the tunes. Sad to see one of my favorite bands have to jump into the gutter with the no-talents who do this kid of thing because they have no vocabulary.If you've been scared away by the recent experiments into mediocity with King's X - don't be afraid to buy this one. The guys are headed back in the right direction. First King's X CD in awhile that I've immediately jumped back and played 2-3 tracks over and over again . . . ."
3,Not bad...not great... but worth a listen (3.75 stars),"I am long time King's X fan and I own every album. The last few releases (Black Like Sunday, Manic Moonlight, etc. ) were really weak efforts. I struggled to find songs that were worthwhile of a repeat listening. For those of you who agree with me, this CD will be a pleasant suprise. I applaud King's X for getting an outside producer, and it really helped. The songs, engineering, and production are much improved. However, this stops short of getting back to the days when they were at their peak. Worgelms ealrier review is pretty dead on. Ty is ""nuetered"" on this cd, not very many solos! What is up with that? C'mon guys, us King's X fans still appreciate guitar solos. Overall, this CD is worth getting, especially if you were put off by the previous releases. But those of you with ""producer ears"" will find a few flaws."
5,Excellent CD.,"After hearing ""Welcome Home Mr. Bulbous Head"" I was going to give up on King's X, but I took a chance on this CD and was pleasantly surprised. All of the songs are very strong and I especially liked their retooling of ""Goldilox."" Of course there is always that last track of noise that I could do without and I don't see a point in having it, but the actual songs were pure King's X goodness."
3,Only a Couple of Good Tracks,"I have been listening to this band since 1988. Their self-titled 1992 major label release on Atlantic was by far their best effort along the way. After reading some reviews on Amazon, I thought perhaps the boyz had rediscovered some of their old magic. Sorry, it's a step back in the right direction but generally continues the band on it's repetitive path with non-memorable hooks. Don't get me wrong, this is a listenable album but not one that will have you yearning to hear again and again."
3,Finished,"I have all KingsX albums. I been a huge fan since their first records. It might be my favorite band of all time.I'm sorry to say that this is the end for them. All their albums had something special. I always tought that what they came up with, was far ahead of their time, but this record is nothing more that a clone of their own material.You can hear that they never put any soul on any of this songs, exept goldilox, that's an old song from their first album.I'm sure they made this album pretty fast.Mabye just to make some money on their name.It's a same. I never tought it would come to this.For people never heard them before, it can be a trill.You can at least hear, what great band they still are.Don't get me completly wrong. There are some nice songs like,Freedom.I don't think there will be more KingsX records.They are burned out.Buy all their older records. Keep away from this one.It's like when Van Halen III came out. I was so angry that I broke it ;)This one is not that bad :)"
4,Great New material from KING's X,This beats most of anything I hear on ther radio these days. KING's X still creating great Rock that punches right through.
3,King's X Are Ogre Their Slump,"Finally -- King's X returns to form with what is perhaps their best effort since TapeHead back in 1998. From the great album art, the fresh production and the trademark vocals and hooks, the trio seems to have found new life with Ogre Tones.Quick (for King's X) and catchy, less aggressive tunes populate this disc, and at the top of the must-hear heap sit Alone, Stay, Hurricane, Fly, Honesty and Freedom (an old B-side given new life). The band only falters on one or two tracks, (namely Be Bop and Sooner or Later) but even these are miles better than much of what has come out of this band over the course of the last few years.While this is not their best disc, it is a wonderful step into a new direction that seems to be signalling that there is still plenty of listening enjoyment left in this band.Not as great as Ear Candy or Gretchen Goes To Nebraska, but still a disc worth owning.My only question: Why did they re-record Goldilox???"
5,King's Best!,"This is the CD I have been waiting for them to put out. I was a little disappointed in the last few CDs that they released. I saw Kings X back in 2001 and they put on an incredible high-energy performance that I absolutely loved. I also picked up Ty Tabor's incredible solo CD ""Safety"" and I was really looking forward to something really powerful from the band. Well, not until I heard this CD did it finally all come together. This is their best effort - hands down! This is the King's X I know and love. Awesome band and songwriters!"
5,One of the Best Ever!,"I have been a fan of King's X since I was 14. They are one of the best, underated hard rock acts out there. I have to say the 1993 release, ""Dogman,"" has been and shall always be my favorite album, but this one...is the closest thing to that. This record is heavy, punchy and full of attitude, and I loved it. ""Alone,"" ""Stay,"" ""If,"" and ""Open My Eyes,"" are the King's X songs I want to hear. ""Freedom,"" Ty Tabor (guitarist) sings this one ...and this song has SO MUCH TO SAY! They also re-recorded the song, ""Goldilox,"" from their first album, ""Out Of The Silent Planet,"" and it was awesome. I find this band so amazing ...they continually top themselves EVERYTIME! Get this CD!"
1,Dazzle dig.video creator,"DAZZLE HAS GOT TO BE THE WORSE COMPANY ON EARTH. BOTH IN PRODUCT QUALITY, AND ESPECIALLY SERVICE. FIRST YOU CAN'T CONTACT ANYONE ON LINE. THEY WANT YOU TO JOIN. SO YOU JOIN. THEN YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD, AND IT DON'T WORK. THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH TO CONTACT LIVE SUPPORT ON LINE. A FEW YEARS AGO I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT, THE dazzle dig.vid.creator 85. IT WORKED BRIEFLY BUT THEN SAID I NEEDED DIFFERENT DRIVERS. THE JERK I TALKED TO ACTUALLY TOLD ME HE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE BOTHERED WITH LITTLE REQUESTS LIKE THAT. SO I JUST GIVE UP ON THEM. I TRIED IT AGAIN TONIGHT, AND NOW I CAN'T GET ANYONE AT ALL. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DAZZLE OR PINNACLE!(usually I'm much more polite)Pinnacle DVD Maker Plus Quickly Transfer Vhs Tapes To Dvd"
2,A peculiar view on heraldic designs,"John Bergling's 1,400 heraldic designs, published in 1913, walks a thin line between trying to depict heraldic designs in a pleasing simple way, and the truly awful 'victoriana' as done by the likes of Fairbairn. His historic interpretation leaves something to be desired (like showing shields with crests only, which is simply 'not done'), and a lot of the American arms are drawn with slightly more Hollywood than Heraldry in mind. But sometimes you can feel some of the original power of heraldry flowing underneath his drawings."
2,Sent me the wrong thing,"I know I love these pens. They're the perfect size, shape, and the ink comes out smoothly and doesn't blot.But when I bought replacements from amazon, they sent me the new kind (not the kind pictured) which while similar in size and shape with just a gray grip instead of black, is of much poorer quality. The new kind with gray grip does not write as smoothly and leaves blot marks on my papers.I wish I could find someone really selling the original."
2,Didn't receive the item pictured,"I ordered these pens based off of the item that was pictured. I LOVE the pens that are depicted (they are a previous ""model"". The rubber grip was offered much more padding.) The model that they sent offer essentially no padding, and needless to say, I am thoroughly disappointed."
2,Not happy.,The item that I purchased was not the item that was pictured or I was under the impression that I was purchasing.
3,Bic Pick?,I have used the Atlantis pens with black ink and I love them. I'm not sure if they recently changed their formula but the red ink pens didn't write as well as the black ones.
5,"Exactally how pictured, but better!","I just recieved these shoes, and yes I must admit they were expensive to get to Canada, espically for canvas shoes, but they are even better then I had hoped! They are absolutely delicious!one note, for anyone who is a vegan, as am I. I wish they had stated that the inside heal was made of suade! *sigh* but It would cost too much to return them now (and quite frankly, I love them too much)"
4,Great Fun,I found this film to be a lot of fun. It's got some campy stuff but it works!I found the casting spot on! Poor Fluffy!!! Be sure to see this Guy flick!!!!
4,Good clean fun!,"I gotta say, the movie is way better than I expected. It has a great B movie sensibility but is actually shot and directed really well. Ostensibly the story is ""The mob crossed the wrong guy and now they're getting some payback"" but it tells that story with a good sense of humor and never takes itself too seriously. The first 5 minutes lets you know what to expect and puts you on notice that you're in for some great, popcorn chowing fun. I'd be lying if I didn't like it at least a little bit because of the fact that it is a 100% born and bred right here in Las Vegas, my home town. Rarely do we see movies based in the less recognizable portions of Vegas that I see every day.Look, the movie has strip clubs, bikers, the mob, a hit man, lots and lots of guns and beat downs. How can you go wrong? Get your friends, get a case of your favorite beer, have a movie night you'll all enjoy."
3,gruffy and fluffy do vegas,"gruffy and fluffy, trying to elude snuffy, and his gang of outlaws, run around vegas.....sometimes they use a ford truck.......fighting, swearing, and an unmistakable open vein of religion combine to make this a movie unlike the one you saw last week.Should you see it ? why not !! gruffy is fluffy, and fluffy is gruffy, and in the end all is revealed as you hoped it would be.But remember, it's better if all that happens in vegas stays in vegas.Ten years from now, this is the only vegas movie you will want to remember. But then you're a dummie......"
4,Stories of Pioneer Ontario,"Essentially the prequal to The Man from Glengarry, Glengarry School Days was in its day an extremely popular book. The stories in this book are set in rural eastern Ontario during the 1870s and are supposedly fictionalized accounts of true events. As one can gather from the title of the book, the stories revolve aroung school-life and (male) school children, in particular a boy named Hughie Murray. Overall, the book is interesting, especially if one has an interest in Ontario or Scotish-Canadian history. But the sometimes overly sentimental and narrative is somewhat taxing, as is the religious moralization (which was no doubt common at the time). This does not detract from the fact that this book is an important work of Canadiana."
4,"Scary, well-written study, very important","This is a scary book about the ways terrorists are using the Internet. It is very interesting, well documented, well-written (easy for people like me who are not sophisticated Internet users) and very alarming. The author knows well the dark sides of the Net and guides the readers to the darkest virtual streets modern terrorists take when using the cyberspace. The book is loaded with examples from various terrorist groups (all are now on the Net) and relates the findings to the framework of communication studies and psychological warfare. What to do about it? Well, read the book's last chapters...I highly recommend this book though it left me troubled and scared.Michael Wise"
3,Fear mongering and calls for government intervention,"Mr. Weimann from Israel wants American government control over access to certain Internet websites so that terrorists won't be able to communicate; or perhaps the real reason is to block Moslem news and propaganda so that we will be exposed only to Israeli-slanted news and propaganda. That way the US can continue to support Israeli efforts at ethnic cleansing from all the land which they say God promised them. Still not convinced? Mr. Weimann is a fellow at the ironically-named United States Institute for Peace, a neocon thinktank."
1,Disaster and misrepresentation,"Although these ""Cranberry"" towels perfectly match the 50's style American Standard ""Loganberry"" tiles and fixtures, they have failed in three different ways. 1) After three washes including one drying with a Bounce cloth in the dryer they continue to retain a high level of lint. It comes off all over me after a shower plus everything else in the wash. 2) Although soft to touch, they don't even dry my short hair. This very same problem was observed by my sister who purchased a neutral color and praised Egyptian cotton for its absorbancy. She is returning hers for lack of absorbancy. 3) Both I and my sister noticed that at the third wash the towels were starting to pile and form loose threads. I found myself spending 10 minutes per towel trying to valet them."
3,The color seems to affect both lint and absorbence,"I got a parchment bath sheet and absolutely loved it. It worked flawlessly from the first wash. So, I ordered a set of hand towels as well, but in the Danube color instead. Not only was there a lot of lint coming off of them, it took 5-8 trips through the laundry before they started absorbing properly. It appears that the dye really affects how well these work from the start."
1,Black bath sheet,"Towels looked great when they arrived. We put them in the washer and dryer before first use and the lint they released was almost overwhelming so we washed them again. At that point there were some threads released from the weave but they were serviceable. At first use the towels barely absorbed water. Moisture remained on the surface of the towel, was cold and further drying felt like you were using a soaked, wet towel to try to dry because of the unabsorbed water. This particular color of towel isn't worth the price even if they were free. In contrast some ginger colored towels from the same source and manufacturer, were better yet not what good towels should be. Never again!"
1,Terrible quality,These towels tore and fell apart within a few months of very light guest use. The quality is extremely poor.
1,Terrible quality towels - NOT made in England either...,"These towels leave lint everywhere... Even after washing... They are Made in India, and are cheap quality... Since when did Christy's of England start making their hand towels in India? The hand towels are still made in England, but these bath towels are some of the worst quality I've seen :("
5,Love this brand.,"I have never had problems with my Christy renaissance towels. Theywash and dry beautifully (I don't use softeners or softener sheets), comeout luxurious and fluffy. I never have a problem with loose threads. Since I purchase only whites and lightest beige I cannot comment on fading.If they're good enough for Queen Elizabeth they'll do just fine for me..."
3,"Ok, very soft, not very heavy though","Very soft and ""feel good"" towel. However not very heavy, which I am used to with my other towels. Drys well, and very very soft. Not sure such a great deal for $20 however."
3,COLOR LIGHTER THAN DESCRIBED,"The color described is actually darker in the photo than the actual product. I was disappointed, especially for the price."
5,Excellent towels,"I own a dozen of these towels and they are quite possibly the best towels available on the American market. The colors might not match the computer screen but if you would calibrate you monitor and then have accurate color to view you will find the oolors very accurate. Over a period of four years I have never had any problem with Christy towels. The threads have never come off on my skin as I wash them thouroughly before using. The one comparable towels to this are Des Camps towels but try using these for four years and you will have threadbare towels, many with holes and certainly all ready for replacement. The Christy towels seem to never loose strenth or thickness and also get softer with more washings. Absorbancy is better than any other towel on the market."
4,very soft,"I would recommend this towel to anyone who wants a reasonably priced higher end towel. I have also ordered the bath towels and bath mats. The color is gorgeous and stays soft after washing. Don't have to worry about the towel ""coming off on you"" after a shower."
2,Not very absorbent...,"I was very excited when I ordered these towels, but I must say I've been disappointed. When I washed them before using them, a LOT of lint came off in both the washer and dryer, and they're still shedding lint. In addition, they're neither as soft nor as absorbent as much cheaper towels you can get from Target or Kmart. In contrast, we also got the Eloquence towels, and I have been THRILLED with them - very absorbent, and very soft."
2,Not very durable,"These are pretty and reasonably soft, but not at all durable. After only a wash or two the edges were already becoming frayed. I have to say I'm disappointed, especially given the price."
2,"Sorry, but they just are NOT absorbant","We bought a complete set of these for our bathroom several months ago. After several washings they have left a ton of lint in the dryer filter and they STILL are not absorbant. They just do not dry you off. Period. Sure, they feel nice and cushy and they're very pretty, but they don't do the job. If I could return them I would, but unfortunately I did not buy them from Amazon."
5,Highly Recommend for Beginners +,"I am not a dancer, but this was fun and easy. In fact, I thought it was so easy it probably wasn't doing me any good as far as being ""real"" exercise. Two days later I learned how wrong I had been! My abs and obliques definitely let me know they had been worked. I have a new respect for dancers, indeed. No wonder they have such great bodies. The instructor teaches you each small step of choreography and then adds another and another until you have done an entire routine. I exercise 4-6 times a week with purpose. I am over 40 and about as coordinated as a water buffalo, but I enjoyed this dvd. It is a fun worthwhile workout to add to your collection! Oh, the weight belt is a good addition, although it's only 1-2 lbs or so. It is also adjustable. Sometimes I wear it to walk."
2,Dance your body,I only give this two cause you do actually get a workout but only cause your trying to keep up with her. Not the easiest workout to follow.
3,Smaller than I expected,They are nice quality - if you want a small hoop. They are not much larger in circumference than a sleeper hoop... I just expected a bigger one.
2,Too Small & Way Overpriced,"I was so excited to get these earrings and when I opened them, I was very disappointed. They are tiny! I should have looked at the measurements more carefully, but I figured they would be a ""normal size"" hoop - not a thin ""huggie"" style - especialy for $70!! Also, they are not very shinny. I am returning them."
2,fantasy ball not for real ballers,the game is not realistic at all if you just like arcade action than this is your game but other then that if you are a serious balller this game is not for you when you score 100 to 150 points by half time then it is time to hang it up i love ea sports games but they took a step back with this one
3,"Fun game, but not very realistic","NBA Live 2003 is very fun... at the beginning. It is basically a dunkfest. All you have to do is cross over your opponent and do a mind boggling dunk. Sounds fun? Not if you do it 15 billion times. The graphics are great, definitely the best out of all the Live titles. The online play is awesome. It is fun chatting with people and taking them on. The franchise mode is okay, but it gets kind of boring. It is an okay game overall and I recommend buying it because this is only basketball game for PC. By the way, the soundtrack is horrible."
3,Fun in The beginning,Well as many people did I absoultley loved this game when i first got it and then..well... it got boring after playing for some time and I found myself able to beat any team on any level. This game Nba Live 2003 was not very challegning and I recommend you buy MVp baseball 2003 or Madden 2004 for they will make you happier than Nba Live 2003.
2,buy nba2k3,the graphics are fuzzy they need to create a career mode the rosters are rong people dont look like themself i rented nba live and nba 2k3 i love 2k3 you will regret deeply if you waist your money on this it stinks!!!!!!!!!!! im glad i did not waste my money on it the music is vvveeeerrryyy repeative it only has about 5 songs id rather watch grass grow than play this i hate it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Disappointment - needs UPDATES,"If you happen to own one of the new ATI cards, the game wont work. So I gave it 1 star because EA sports should have fixed an issue like this before releasing a game.My system:Pentium 4 running Windows XP with an ATI 9700 PRO. It restarts the system every time I try to run the game.I am disappointed because the game we release only a couple of days ago, and the ATI cards have been in the market for more than 3 months already, and it just doesn't run with it.I cannot comment on anything game specific. I just wanted to warn people out there with new graphic cards."
4,"Fun, But where's the custom teams?!!!","NBA Live 2003 is definitely the best basketball simulation that I've played. The graphics are top-notch, with players that are very much like their real-life counterparts. However, one of my favorite features from the 2002 version, custom teams, is missing! Being able to pick any players you want and put them on a team of your choice was great! Why, EA Sports, did you get rid of it? Hopefully, custom teams, plus dunking and 3 point contests, will be in 2004 and make it a 5-star game."
4,I really liked this game,"I thought this game was really fun; for a while. It got a little boring after a while. One thing I didn't like about NBA Live 2003 was it didn't have some of the really cool featrues of NBA 2000. One good thing about this game is that it is very realitstic. As a huge NBA fan and a basketball player, I think would have a pretty good idea. The moves in this game a fantastic. That is one thing that I love about this game. I can make myself(in the create a player screen) and emulate my own crossovers and spins. I consider myself a pretty good basketball player averaging around 25 a game, so I think this game probably better for people who like basketball or are interested in basketball."
2,Unhappy User,"I could not believe that EA did not add a save function that allowed users to save during a game. Unless you intend on playing an entire game, everything will be lost. After realizing this, I returned the product for a full refund?"
2,Awful product from the premier sports game makers,"I cannot believe that this game is so awful, even after EA Sports decided to scrap the 2002 version. I had been a huge fan of EA Sports games because of their ""close to reality"" gameplay. Live 2003 is nothing but another version of NBA 2K3... the king of arcade games. I enjoy the fun aspect of the game, but not to where FG% is over 80% constantly. The AI is so awful and you can't adjust it like in Madden 2003 (can't the developers share some secrets?). The graphics is awesome, the soundtrack is platinum-quality. But too bad I can't even play 8-minute quarter without scoring less than 100 points and shooting over 80%. RIDICULOUS!!"
1,The door that does not work,"The box is heavy enough but the front panel door is a comlete ""joke"" Antec should have never let this happen. It is made out of plastic that is not heavy enough to use to make kites out of. Very poor design."
5,Amazing Work,"I heard him in Santa Cruz (years ago) and bought a CD. Wow, so glad I did! His music is a must have. I'm going to get another for a gift."
2,Bad reader,"I would not recommend the audio version of this book. The story was good enough, but it would have been much more enjoyable if I were reading it myself. It sounded like the person was reading it for the first time, his sense of when to pause was terrible (continuing like there was going to be another sentence at the end of each chapter!), and he sounded distracted at best during the entire book. I feel like he had more fun just doing the voices of the characters, which were enthusiastic, but also very annoying at certain parts. I don't know how this man got the job for this, but I feel like he destroyed what should have been a much more suspenseful and enjoyable book."
1,A very disappointing book,"I bought this book to read to my young son who is learning to play the bagpipe (chanter lessons).The book went into too many areas of the family that were not only unnecessary, but not for the younger reader. For instance, why did we need to hear about Protestant vs. Catholic issues in the classroom, as well as Sandy's parents financial condition, other than having to sacrifice to pay for lessons and a chanter. Although set in the 50' or 60's, the end was so syrupy that I couldn't stand it.I read this myself , and upon finishing it, I threw it away, something I've never done before."
3,"Not Quite Beautiful, Remastered","This attempt at re-mastering then re-issuing on CD doesn't quite work. I bought the expensive import version, thinking I would acquire an enhanced recording level of the orchestra and string section, but found it acoustically unchallenging. If you're turntable's still working, try and get the LP version, if you can because it sounds better. For those of you who are fans of the film composer Bernard Herrmann, and are curious about Nat 'King' Cole's vocal rendition of ''Marnie'', I would recommend ordering the new version as recorded by American vocalist, Michael Poss. This particular lush arrangement swells dramatically with a full string section, and is available on Michael's 'SILVER SCREEN SERENADES' CD, from Twilight Souls Music."
1,MAM,"This is a total rip-off of E.T. the special effects are corny and cartoony at best.Like QFC,this movie rips-off every film you think of like The aliens becoming U.S. Citizens a'la Johnny 5 in Short Circuit 2.I specially hate the scene where the kid in the wheelchair(yes,you heard me) falls into the lake.This is just one big cross commerical for coca-cola & Mcdonalds. I give this ripoff a 0 out of 10."
4,I loved Mac and Me!,Mac is a baby alien who gets caught in a USA probe ship. Taken to earth he ends up with a family who moves to California.The youngest boy is in a wheel chair due to a auto accident. Eric and Mac become best friends. The cutest scene is when Mac dresses in a bear costume {to hide from Nasa}and dances on the counter in McDonalds. They end up helping Mac's family in this film that just steals your heart. Personally I think it is better than ET. I looked everywhere for this on DVD and found it at Amazon.
3,ok but not great,this movie is ok. it's no big deal if u don't watch it.the mcdonald's dancing scene is not as bad as the other reviewers say it is and that's all for now.
5,I love this movie,This movie is a classic and it's a great movie. It's alot better than E.T. I have Mac and Me at home and I still watch it all the time. It's a great family movie to own.
2,"Bad movie, but fun to watch","Yeah yeah, product placements, but what is funny is how ""perfectly turned"" the products are to the camera. The skittles bag is poured with a near perfect looking bag. The coke cans are turned toward the camera so the logo shows, the girl is mostly always wearing her McDonalds uniform during the movie, etc.The part I remember most is near the end when wheelchair boy goes boom. His friends bring him over, and one shouts ""He's breathing, he's going to be ok"". Then another guy comes over, looks at him for literally 2 seconds, and says ""There's nothing I can do for him"", and hurries off. Everyone starts crying. HELLO? CPR Anyone? This scene was totally not believable, some movies you get teary eyed when the main character dies off, but in this one, I could really care less.What makes it hilarious is right at the end where you see ""We'll be back"", thankfully that has yet to happen."
1,Mac And Me,This is one of the worst movies that I ever seen. It was copyed from the movie E.T. The Extra Terrestral. I am glad that it bombed at the box office. I almost got up and walked out of the show during the movie. I would give this movie only a half a star but Amazom.com will only let me give it at least one star. It was a waste putting it on tape. I am glad that it was not put on dvd. This is one movie that I am glad that I don't own it and I never will.
2,"It Was Better, When I Was A Kid","I still think this movie is okay. I liked it a lot when I was younger, though. I liked it more than E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. This is like E.T. but it has a different story to it. A kid struggles to find his alien friend's family in the desert. When they do find it. A lot of danger occurs between the two friends. But there is a happy ending, of course. I think this one is more of a family favourite than E.T.If you are really serious about renting it. Then do so. It ain't quite that bad."
5,Very cute movie!,Loved this movie as a kid and had to buy it for my sister and I to watch again as adults. We still laughed!
3,Three stars for amusement only,"This movie is not good or touching in any way. But it is so insanely funny that it is worth the price. The best part is that it leaves room for a sequel at the end...a sequel that, sadly, never came."
4,LMAO At all the reviews!!!!,"I read all of the reviews; some I agree, some I disagree. But reading this while having a crappy day at work gave me a lift in my spirits cause some comments were funny as hell!!!! Could this be any more hilarious!!! I saw the movie years ago and I thought it was cute then. All I can say is only those without any sense of humor or an imagination would dislike this movie."
4,Good movie for parents great for kids,"I first got to enjoy this movie as a kid which i think helped me like it so much. My kid memory gives it 5 stars i only gave it four as an adult though. Its fun, entertaining, interesting and hey... an 80's movie which just says it all! what movie in the 80's wasn't just a tad weird? A great Family Flik :-)"
4,What a Cack.,"If you want to laugh for 2 hours then this is the movie your looking for. but the funniest scene ever that I keep laughing all the time is that lame break dance sequence at McDonald's... What a Laugh. It bring's back the KID in people. What kind of retarded person would throw a dance party at McDonald's? I don't think that could happen in reality. The alien dressing up as a teddy bear is so funny. Yeah the movie is bad not stupid but bad but funny to watch. It is just a funny movie, which gets you laughing and your heart feeling a little warm. I have not watched it some year's, but always remember watching it has a child. I got this item for my Nephew's to watch... they loved it as much as I did when I was a kid."
3,An unabashed E.T. Rip-off... until it met me!,"This movie was cute years ago but having seen it recently, Its god awful and fun!The alien father, mother and sister look like deformed, emaciated cadavers.Aside from that, there is a sick hilarity to be found here watching the wheel-chair bound kid rolling downhill in a state of screaming panic.Yes... I am going to Hell.Enjoy!"
3,95 Minutes of LAUGHTER,"I swear, this movie is worth buying just to have it at your disposal for a laughter session. the mcdonalds dance scene is probably the lamest, but also the funniest thing ive ever seen. how does this stiff crappy alien turn into a 3 feet tall dancing machine in a few seconds?? The only reason for 3 stars is because of its humor content, not bc of its originality (et)"
1,Even The Title Is a Product Placement!,If you want your kids to watch an inferior version of E.T. filled with poor acting and loaded with product placements for Coke and McDonalds you have found your movie! Oh and with an added bonus not included in E.T. Mac and Me offers a disturbing scene in which a disabled wheelchair bound boy falls off a cliff and nearly drowns. Don't worry he is saved by the title alien Mac (get it like a Big Mac sandwich) who apparently needs to drink Coca Cola to stay alive. I was chilled when Mac tells us he'll be back implying he'll be appearing in a followup film but since the movie is now almost twenty years old and no sequel has appeared on the horizon perhaps we can rest easy.
1,wow was this bad,I saw this when it first came out and knew then that this could be the worse movie ever made. When everyone in a Mcdonalds broke out in song and dance I got a little sick. The product placements is way overwhelming.Combine that with the E.T. ripoffs and you get something quite special. It's almost worth watching just because you don't really believe something like this could be made. Watch it if you like train wrecks.
3,I think this movie is funny!,If you want to laugh your ass off for 2 hours then this is the movie your lookin for. Yeah it is a poorly rip off of ET but the funniest scene ever that I keep laughing all the time is that lame break dance sequence at McDonald's. What kind of retarded person would throw a dance party at McDonald's? I don't think that could happen in reality. The alien dressing up as a teddy bear is so funny. Yeah the movie is bad not stupid but bad but funny to watch. Go check it out!
2,Are they serious!,"I actually saw this as a youngster and was rather more bored/disgusted than enchanted. This film, which no matter what they say IS just a bad ET clone, wins the all-time product placement award (edging out Wayne's World for a tinge of insincere plugging) for the McDonald scene and the ""Coca-Cola as panacea"" overtone. If I can't go into further detail, it is because the film doesn't lend itself to lasting impressions, rather to the evil arms of corporate extraterrestrialism."
4,"Interesting series, if book is as good it's a buy","I managed to see only one episode of the series on Disney years ago and seem to remember being impressed with the production values, looked like a good kid's program. If this book is as well done as I think the series was it is worth owning.For those who want to know, the series 1st season is out on DVD, but apparently only in Australia. It's an all region PAL format so you'll either need a PAL DVD player or run it on your computer. I found it on eBay by looking for it under DVD's (I think that was it), the series website is good too: www.jonathan-m-schiff.com.au/og/"
2,Waste of time,"The only useful information in this book are two parts:One is the ""9 blows of janna"" which demonstrates the un-armed combat techniques of the ""assassins"". The other part is called ""Physical penetration"".It has to do with which techniques will work where on the human body. EVERY thing else is useless.....like going naked on missions so dogs wont bark at you.....personally I wouldnt go anywhere near a dog if I didnt have something to ""protect"" myself with.;)I wouldnt buy the book.Everything it has in it...a practitioner of any realistic warrior art would already know this stuff."
4,Non-stop house attack!,"For what is a rather marginal style of music (and recording), Misstress certainly has made her mark in Canada by selling a lot of records. This second volume features the same rhythmic ascension and joy that was so fiercely displayed on her previous instalment, but with maybe a bit more edge. Those who loved the first one need this volume as well."
4,Listen again,"If you listened to this cd once and weren't that impressed Listen again, really close, really loud. You'll understand then. This cd grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you go. To really understand this cd you have to understand Barbara. She is a classically trained drummer and draws heavily upon that in her mixing. The only dj I can think of to compare her to is Carl Cox and as much as she doesn't like to admit or even talk about, the fact that she is female definetely shows on this mix. She adds a much needed feminine touch that is much needed in the dj culture. Get this CD if you like cox or more beat oriented techno."
3,Adequate for individual learners ...,"Adequate for individual learners, probably a bit more valuable for classroom use. This is one of the better Yiddish textbooks I've encountered, though learners completely unfamiliar with the concept of noun declension may struggle somewhat. I also wish there were supplementary audio materials available."
1,This is NOT the Way People Learn A Language!,"Having completed both Book 1 and Book 2, I can tell you that this book is total garbage. This is not the way to learn a language. You don't learn a language by doing mind-numbing grammar exercises and memorizing a lot of vocabulary that is irrelevant to daily conversation. And while all the cultural baggage is nice to know, it doesn't help any with mastering the language. The CDs suffer from a similar flaw. It's too bad that the folks at Pimsleur, who really understand how to teach a language, don't offer a course in Yiddish.Don't waste your time with this one."
5,Delicious with no sugar alcohols,"I have a difficult time finding really good sugar-free syrups that don't contain sugar alcohols (sorbitol, maltitol,etc.) The walden Farms sugar-free line, with no sugar alcohols,is wonderful. The taste and texture are perfect. I use this syrup in hot chocolate, chocolate milk, as an add-in to my coffee, and in cooking. It is a real treat for a chocolate-lover who is sensitive to sugar alcohols"
1,Disgusting,Tastes like salty vinegar. Doesn't taste anything like chocolate syrup at all. Worst Walden Farms product I've tried - and that's really saying something.
3,Not Awful,"This syrup isn't awful. It has a very off taste that is hard to get past. I would rather eat my low carb ice cream plain than with this on top, but I think that it may be useful to add into chocolate recipes. The consistency is also quite different from a normal Hershey's chocolate syrup. It is much runnier and has a stickier (more like pancake syrup) consistency than the thick and smooth consistency that I'm used to.For no calories and no carbs, it's worth a shot. I'm sure I'll find some use for it..."
2,Fake Tasting,"My husband and I tried this on frozen yogurt. We both decided we would rather eat the yogurt by itself than pour this junk on it. I read in some reviews that they mixed it in a shake, maybe that disguise the artificial flavor."
3,"Great Material, Out of Tune Vocal","People tend not to post reviews at Amazon unless they love whatever they're reviewing. Those who are not serious Shindell fans need a word of warning about this CD. The material is great, Shindell is a superb songwriter. The band is terrific. But, way too often, Shindell sings in a HUGE head tone that goes painfully out of tune. I've heard other folk baritones do this. It's a sound that cuts through crowd noise, it gets attention. But it's amazingly grating when you're in your living room listening to a CD. I think I'll keep this CD, for the great songs, and because I can skip tracks. But those who come browsing to this page, who aren't already crazy about Shindell, should get fair warning of what they're in for."
3,deep thinker,"Dear friends,I purchased this CD because a friend recommended it at work. It is very hard hitting and serious. For deep, philosophical thinkers only. I prefer music that is a little lighter and I actually gave this CD away to someone who would enjoy it more than myself."
5,>^..^< Best cat magazine ever!,"I love this magazine. Not only does it include cat photos and facts, it includes funny stories, comics, and unique kitty products! This makes a great gift for all cat lovers!"
2,A Lot of Fluff - Not Much Information,"I bought a subscription thinking it would be a nice suppliment to my Cat Fancy subscription. The ""I Love Cats"" magazine was very thin (hardly magazine worthy) and just didn't have any useful information for me. Overall, I was VERY disappointed in this magazine.If you want a magazine with cute little cat stories than this magazine is for you. If you want solid information about care of your cats get a subscription to Cat Fancy."
3,An adequate introduction,"If you've never encountered the problems in MFaP before, you're sure to find MFaP a decent and generally easygoing introduction to the subject matter. If you have encountered them before, you're sure to find little new between the covers of this slim volume. MFaP is an able and by-the-numbers overview of an exceedingly complex and fascinating topic. Should you read to the end of it, I'd highly recommend having a look at the brief bibliography Bunch assembled. Not all of it represents 2008 state-of-the-art, but there are several outstanding titles on this list to whet the appetite for further study. Read MFaP to taste some choice bits. But be sure to read elsewhere if you it's a feast you're after."
4,Interesting,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Mathematics. The fallacies are interesting, including the author's. For example, on page 94 regarding Oscar Wilde's epigram : ""The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it"". Mr. Bunch suggests this to be a fallacy due to the key word ""only"", and offers an example such as suicide to show ""only"" to be invalid. But would not suicide be a temptation as well? Or for that manner, anything one would try?"
1,Partisan child rearing advice (I'm not kidding),"He starts out on the first few pages railing at Democrats and invoking the Constitution. Typical 'Conservative"" advice. The author writes a column in which he gives, in my opinion, truly awful advice. For those of you who missed the column, the basic story is that the mother of a 19-year-old girl wrote in asking for advice regarding her daughter's boyfriend, who although devoid of icky habits like smoking and partying, never misses the chance to put her down, dismiss her accomplishments or mock her. Dr. Rosemond's suggestion to the mother was to overlook this one ""annoying habit"" and do everything she can to keep him around. After all, he states, "" The likelihood of her finding another boy her age who has a coherent plan for the future ... is slim.""So, if you want insecure daughters and macho sons in traditional roles from many generations back, his advice probably works well for you. Not for me..."
2,Way too radical for my taste!,"This book is full of purposely provoking words, designed to insult anyone who ever thought about how they would like to parent (""rear"" per Rosemond) their child(ren). Although he has some valid and interesting observations, he presents them in such an insulting manner that the reader is less likely to hear them. The book certainly gave me something to talk about!"
5,Mary Youngblood - minimalist-nature beauty,"Youngblood's music has the minimal flute that echoes the timeless Native Indian sound, yet with a unique spirit & soothing flavor. This is beautiful, soulful music."
5,Mary Youngblood's best so far!,"This music has matured. It surpasses anything I've heard from Mary Youngblood so far! Beautiful, haunting, elegant. And what a pleasure to finally hear her voice along with her most excellent flutes. Thank you, thank you."
4,Thought provoking,"I find the magazine thought provoking. Editor-in-chief Forbes and Publisher Karlgaard normally provide some interesting opinions and insights, as do many of the other regular and guest columnists."
2,Forbes Is Boring,"I am not a professional investor, but I decided to give Forbes a chance. I have found the magazine to be pretty boring and dry. I like to read more about what is happening currently in the stock market with individual stocks and this magazine has more articles in it. I found that a lot of the articles couldn't keep my interest. Would recommend getting The Wall Street Journal or Smartmoney before Forbes."
1,Forbes 1-Year Nothing But Advertisement,"Forbes Magazine. Save your money. It's nothing but advertisement. The magazine comes in the mail, and I take it straight to the recycling bin."
2,"Forbes magazine, false advert. via Subscription Centarl","Ordered two year year subscription for Forbes magazine on Dec. 15, 2010 from amazon. Dec. 16, 2010 received from Amazon Payment that order was Successfully Completed. Fourteen weeks later no magazine had been received. After several e-mails and calls to Lexie , Deborah Hankins and Brain, Sales rep. Amazon decided to refund my $24.99, canceling the order and Amazon would furnish me with a one year subscription at no cost. The thing that upsets me most is after 14 weeks Subscription Central decided to cancel my order, holding my money all that time. Brain stated that ""Unfortunately, our clearinghouse is no longer accepting orders for Forbes at that special rate. They change the rates that we pay all he time. Now if I would order another magazine, would they hold my money another 14 weeks and than say they didn't accept that rate? I would not and do not recommend that any one else order magazine via of Amazon.Robert Hermes"
1,Amazon=Lousy Magazine Provider,"Forbes is a great magazine. Amazon on the other hand, well they ought to get out of the magazine business. Order said first issue would be in February. Amazon ""forgot"", to place the order until I called in April to find out what happened. Now they claim the first issue will be June 19. Yeah right. Funny how they don't forget to charge the credit card you place the order.Don't order magazines from Amazon!"
3,"less political, provide greatervariety of views, more business","you're a business magazine, not a right wing political magazine. Steve Forbes' greatest problem is that he's NOT HIS FATHER."
1,Forbes will not respond,"I have always been impressed with Forbes Mutual Fund review. However I have not been able to find where they have published any since January of 2010. I have been e-mailing them for several weeks and they will not respond. I am getting very discouraged with Forbes. If it is no longer published I can just drop my subscription but what is upsetting is that they will not respond. If anyone knows if or where the updated Mutual Fund Review is shown, please let me know.Thank You"
2,Sensational and Lacks In-Depth Research,"I have been a subscriber to Forbes for a half year. After reading all these issues, I dislike this magazine more and more. Most articles are sensational and lack in-depth research. Some are biased and prejudiced. Many articles are written in fictional style without any hard data or analysis. I will not renew my subscription after it expires."
1,Another billionaire ranking? Where's the business news?!?,"Forbes has some problems:1. each issue features yet more conservative opinions promoting trickle down theory. If you want to read articles written by Steve Forbes complaining about having to pay taxes, this is for you!2. after the Steve Forbes commentary, you find yet another billionaire or celebrity salary ranking. If you like to brown nose rich people, this is for you!There is very little investment or actual business advice. Don't even waste your time or money on this magazine, it serves no practical purpose."
3,Biased Articles,"I am not planning on renewing my subscription because many of the articles are blatantly biased with a conservative leaning. It's an interesting magazine with pertinent articles, but it annoys me that a magazine with such a big name can be so obviously biased. Publications should not lean toward what it thinks the readership wants or even toward what the Editor-In-Chief believes."
5,Reliable so far,"I just received the first copy of my subscription made through amazon. So far so good -- the first copy came within around 4 weeks from the subscription date. Only concern is that they have sent me 2 forbes magazines which i hadn't requested (forbes life and forbes investment guide, both for the current month) . Hopefully they don't count this to the total number of issues!"
1,Forbes enver delivered,"As I write this January 4th, 2007, I have never gotten my first or any issue of Forbes (for which I paid on October 2, 2006). If I ever get something maybe I'd like it."
2,Look at the dates on the really positive reviews,"Forbes ain't what it used to be. I read it a long time ago and recently accepted a $12/year subscription to get it again. Boy, was I disappointed. It was the same stuff, month after month, talking about how rich rich people were. No insights, no observations, no analysis, lots of ads.Before you subscribe try to get your hands on a current issue and see if it is what you want it to be.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can. I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it."
3,Not as good as it used to be,"i've been a Forbes reader for more than 20 years. They used to be the best; especially in exposing crooks. but in the last two or three years, they have started mixing political content into the news pages. Their columnists are interesting and have every right to express an opinion - and that's where i expect to find the opinions. but news articles are tending to look more like product placements, written to support a certain point of view instead of to tell both sides of a story impartially. It has becoome the moral equivalent of Fox for business. Fine if you want to read politics, but not where you go for the whole story."
1,I ordered a specific part number and a generic one was sent.,Amazon advertised a specific part number and sent a generic one that could not be used.
4,Watch this movie!,"I watched this movie years ago & I happened to like the movie alot! I don't agree w/ the other reviews @ all! But, to each ur own! I'd say watch the movie. Most of the time I don't agree w/ other ppl anyways. So, make up ur own mind!"
2,Below par Nature on the Rampage picture,"Killer baboons are the hook on which the plot of this one gets hung .The setting is Kenya where the pesky primates have developed a taste for human flesh during a prolonged drought and go on the rampage devouring anyone unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity.It is supposedly based on a true incident but very little of the movie rings true in any way .There are only a handful of baboons on display and budgetary restrictions are all too apparent .The end credits aay that no animals were harmed in the making of the movie .This may wellbe true -and I devoutly hope it is -but the reputation of its human actors ,who include Timothy Bottoms and John Rhys Davies would not have fared so wellOnly if you are really into the genre and are prepared to put ypur brain in cold storage for the duration of the picture ."
1,Dissappointed,"Unable to view the movie wound so tight vcr unable to fast forward, rewind, or play. The seller was kind enough to fefund my purchase which I am grateful and I wil keep looking for this product until I find it. The experience was all new to me disappointed yes and irritated at the time but accidents happen. Life goes on."
4,Item is perfect but missing parts...,"This is a great product but the claps for attaching it to the cage were not included. I ended up using wiring to secure it in place. If it's not secure, the tray would move and possibly tip over when the rabbit jumps off."
2,Really Small,"Bought it for our small Holland Lop rabbits, who are small. But, this box is only appropriate for a very, very small rabbit."
3,Doesn't stay attached to the side of the cage.,This works ok but it doesn't stay attached to the side of the cage so it slides around and makes a mess.
3,"Great in theory, but our rabbit doesn't like it much","Our rabbit doesn't seem to like it which I suspect is due to the wire part that is supposed to contain the litter. She has two litter boxes and doesn't really like this one. Even when I switched the locations, she just stayed off of this one. It fit in the corner great and seemed sturdily built, so I would think that less fussy rabbits would do fine with it."
2,Litter Pan,"The item arrived late, but it arrived. I did have to write Ozbo (the company) to remind them to ship it, and upon replying they had not shipped it. They promised that it would arrive on time, but it didn't. I suppose you should hope that your item isn't anything valuable that might break, since they don't package items well. Other than that, the product was fine and as advertised. I am giving it two stars for the service, not for the product."
1,Poor Quality product,"I've purchased 6 units and they have all failed at least once. They are failing about 30 days after installation. I've used Poweline products before and have not had any failures. The D-Link Powerline HD devices are junk, save your money and purchase another vendors product like Linksys or Netgear. I'm currently using Corinex powerline products and they are rock solid 60+ Mbps. They don't seem to traverse different breakers well though. I've installed a phase coupler with no success."
1,Inconsistent and fragile,"I actually get fairly good throughput when the units work, about 25 Mbps (and I am running them across circuits). The main issue I have is that throughput regularly drops to less than 400 kbps, and on occasion does not work at all. I initially assumed this was because something in my house was causing interference, but I haven't found anything consistently running when I have issues. I have had sudden connection problems in the middle of the night when I'm the only one awake and I know that nothing was suddenly turned on.Additionally, I had one of my units fail within 6 months. I was able to return them to D-Link, and the return process was actually pretty good, but it doesn't leave me with a lot of confidence in their quality (especially considering there are multiple other posters who have had the same problem).Buy something else!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,Worked for two days then failed. The company (they were very helpful) sent out two more units and niether worked. Bad product. The selling party did try to resolve the problem. Don't even think about purchasing this product.
1,failed in 30 days,One of the adapters failed in 30 days. Feel is design problem with not handling the heat this item generates.
1,Works great until it stops working,"Like some of the other reviews here, my powerline HD units died within a few weeks of setting them up. The first time it took about 4 weeks until one of the units died. Figuring I just got a defective product (it happens) I took them both back to Best Buy and got a replacement of the same thing. 2 weeks later both units died and it's obvious now that it's just a defective design overall. It sucks because I was very happy with the performance until they died."
1,I own 6 dead units,"I bought 6 of these units and one by one they all failed within 6 months. No returns, no refunds. Buyer beware. D-Link is off of my list. (I did not buy them from Amazon). D-Link customer service is non-existant."
2,Poor performance in real world,"Make sure you can return this (and might want to turn off Amazon Prime).Only got 200-300 kbps (far below wireless) from room to room, 100 kbps upstairs.Not an ideal situation since breaker box is on opposite side of the house though fairly modern wiring. Disappointing. I ran physical cable instead taking much of a day (and I already have the right equipment/faceplates/etc. laying around).Pretty easy to setup/use. Good value for certain situations."
1,Do not buy this product!,"This product is just a joke. It will burn out in a few days. And D-link has worst customer service ever and they don't listen to you. They will screw you up ever. Seriously, do not buy this product. I will not even buy any product from D-link."
3,Works as advertised........BUT.........,"The DHP-301 units worked as advertised and provide a great, high-speed link in my home network but the mortality rate of these units has been extremely high. I bought six units because I wanted spares as well as enough units to connect several computers throughout my house and two of the units have died in less than a year (one died within a week of first being plugged in)."
5,Etienne Daho CD,I like most of the songs in this French Cd by Daho. The Cd arrived in a timely manner.
2,Uninspiring...,"I've been listening to Etienne Daho since high school (I lived in France for 10 years, and can easily remember when Tombe Pour La France was a big hit over there). This CD really is quite uninspiring. All the tracks pretty much sound alike, and his musical talents are definately not put to the test.If you're interested in french music, pick up one of his best CD's, Pour nos vies Martiennes, which has tons of beautiful songs, and exceptional lyrics (for those of you know french, the track Des Ir will definately appeal to your more poetic side).Eden lacks in character... but Etienne is definately a good source for french pop... His latest release is just... uninspired."
4,Spanish Culture Embraced,"Finally, a book that embraces both the Spanish language and culture in a story formatted for kids! For me, the most important lesson in this book was that we should always forgive each other's mistakes. Even though the horses make an error in judgement, in the end, the Three Kings forgive them and deliver their gifts in good faith that the horses have learned their lesson. It's a great book that teaches kids to put faith and trust in others. AND it's nice to see a book that achknowledges El Dia de los Reyes. For one of my kids' favorite holidays, I now have a favorite book."
3,It was worth $10 but not more,"For the money, I thought it was just okay. It is in German and it was hard changing to English."
2,No 3D effect at all,"I ordered this 3D Blu-Ray disc based on a couple of good reviews. I was excited to sit down with my kids to watch the new 3D under sea tour. Of course we all had on our Active 3D glasses. We've watched many other 3D movies on our setup and liked it very much (mostly kids movies like How To Train Your Dragon, and live concerts). This particular disc has no 3D effect at all. My Active 3D glasses (that automatically darken when they detect a 3D signal) didn't even darken. The screen looked exactly the same with or without the glasses on; normally the 3D screen looks terrible if you are not wearing the glasses. It's like the disc is labeled 3D but is actually just a regular Blu-Ray disc. Very disappointing. We watched about 20 minutes of it - it's an okay show if you want a 2D aquarium tour with some soothing music, but it is certainly not a stunning 3D under sea adventure. I am returning this item the day after receiving it. Very disappointed."
2,"Lame, Lame, Lame Marginal 3D, terrible dialouge, 3D ONLY","ARrrgggg. Had hoped for more but the other reviews are dead on. Colors are rich but the 3d is marginal and intermittent silt in the water is a major distraction. Being a blu ray I had also hoped that it would have a 2D version as an option to play as background during gatherings or simply as a screen saver. This is a 3D ONLY disc.The reader is exceptionally poor as is the sub par plot line. Have to say that there are better undersea videos like the very well done, 2D only, Reefscapes: Nature's Aquarium DVD. Loved Reefscapes and can't wait for them to try some 3D someday.Except for animated content, good 3D content is just hard to find.Oh Well, it'll go straight to my next garage sale. $5 would have been more like it. BOO HISS. Rotten Tomato time."
1,"Well, that sucked...","This is the worst 3d video I have ever seen. It's not vibrant. It's not at all educational. I had to keep taking my glasses off to see if I had fingerprints on them. The voiceover is 10 times louder then the music, and sounds like it was recorded on the worlds' hottest mic. I'm not at all happy that I wasted my money on this..."
1,terrible 3d,This film is the worst ive seen through the whole movie there is reflection in the camera lens which looks like a smudge I have an extensive 3d movie collection and this is just horrible
3,Nice 3D effects...if you can sit through the whole movie.,"All in all, this is an OK buy for the 3D effects. The narration is horrific and it is the same lady that did the animal one that Amazon pulled due to playback issues. They show the same fish over and over again for 50 minutes and it becomes old very quickly."
4,Good watch !,My son loved this dvd. He really enjoyed learning about the different sea creatures and their odd ways of life.The price is more than ok I think for a 3D movie !
2,just so - so,I personally did not feel the video quality was all there for a blu ray... seemed like it was shot on a cheap 3d camera rig to me .... the underwater scenes did not seem very 3d and lacked vibrant color.... felt like an sd recording... I was expecting a Discovery Channel type professional video shoot and it felt more like someones video project instead..... the narration seemed unprofessional and high schoolish ..... there is NO WAY this was an imax presentation .....
3,Just ok.,These are not really nice quality shirts. They are stiff and very thin. I think size is pretty accurate. Not sure if I will use for groomsmen or not. Might be a little too cheap/low quality next to the grooms' suit and bridesmaid dresses.
3,Almost great,I have 4 boys and therefore I am always in the market for good sandals. These Teva sandals are very good quality and I have always had very reliable experiences with Teva. I have the Hurricane sandals for one of my older boys in size 3. They work great for him and are easy to use but my 4 year old who is a size 11 cannot get these on. The back strap does not adjust which is fine for bigger sizes because the strap across the ankle is bigger and can be pulled out much more. In the size 11 the ankle strap can only be opened a little so it is really hard to slide his foot in. Even with my help they are difficult to get on. For smaller feet I recommend the Tyro or Psyclone which works much better instead of the Hurricane. Other than that though the sandals are really great.
5,Good 4 women w/ wide feet.,"Ok, so I got these for myself. I loved Teva's Terradactyles(think 1993-ish?). Anyway, these looked like the closest thing I could find. Anyway, they are extremely comfortable, and as far as sizing goes, the kids 6 is roughly women's 8-8.5. You can compare the sizing on Teva's website if in doubt. And they fit wide, so if you have narrow feet, these probably are NOT the ones for you."
5,My 7 year old son loves these sandals!,"These sandals are great for kids! They are easy for my son to put on and adjust quickly. They stay on well, so he is able to run and climb in them. He says they're very comfortable and did not require a break-in period. I want a pair, too!"
5,Great & comfortable,"So glad we bought these, plus they were on sale. My stepdaughter loves them, and is pretty picky about how shoes feel on her feet. She says they're very comfortable. She wears them all the time, even when they really don't go well with her outfit :) I have an adult size pair of teva sandals and have had them for YEARS. Great brand and products."
2,tight shoes,i like teva shoes and sandals but this one is tight. my little one can hardly push his toes in front.
5,Comfortable and Easy to Take Off/Put On,"My kids love these shoes - they are easy to take off and put on, they are comfortable and they are durable. Another great plus is that you can spray them off with the hose and they look good as new!"
1,Horrible and poor customer service,I bought my son Teva's and before the summer was over the velco would no longer stick it had worn out. I emailed Teva's customer service and I got no response so I emailed them again and again NOTHING! I no longer buy Teva anything and my whole family has switched to Keen. Last summer my active son's keens held up so well they can even be passed down to his little brother. Keens cost about double but they are worth it because they last all summer and then some.
4,Excellent choice,"We bought these as ""water shoes"" to use in Jamaica for one of my boys, and they have turned into his favorite warm weather shoe. They are very durable, and well made, and generally comfortable. Occasionally he does get a little irritated in the ankle area, but that goes with sandals. Great value and a great show. Highly recommended."
5,Run a little big,These sandals run about a half size too big. They are a good quality and are great for our water walks and barnyard walks because they are easy to clean too. We have been everywhere in these and have not slipped yet.
2,Buy newer edition!,"Dr. Sarno's concept is sound, but this is his first report, rather old. There are two newer books, the best of which, of course, is the 2006 ""The Divided Mind : The Epidemic of Mindbody Disorders"", which I highly recommend."
1,If only it were this easy,"While it is important to consider all possible causes of back pain, this book gives many irresponsible generalizations about the causes for back pain and the solutions as well as their results. It pretty much says, it is all in your head and surgery and physical therapy will cure only about 1% of the patients. I don't agree with this and although I kept reading to see what I could glean from the book that might be helpful, I was very disappointed that I spent money on the book."
2,TINY LITTLE BOOK NOT WORTH THE CASH,"Looks good in the pictures, but when it arrived, I was amazed how small it was: it was tiny, tiddly, minutte, thin and scrawny. That book needs a meal, to bulk it up,It had some content though, but not a lot.The message is this: it's in your mind baby - think better get better.It has some merit."
1,Did I miss something?,Did I miss something? Clearly from the title alone Dr. Sarno believes tension and tightening of muscles is the cause of most back/leg pain. Where is the chapter that gives you steps to change this?! I didn't need to buy this book.
1,Disappointing,"After reading many of the other reader reviews, I had high hopes for this book. I read Dr. Sarno's theory and accepted it quickly, then I read about it some more and some more and some more. When I finally arrived at the treatment portion (the last 12 pages or so of the book) I was very disappointed in it. I found that the cure for my constant back pain seems to require my moving to New York to become Dr. Sarno's patient, attend his lectures, and take his referral to a physical therapist...all quite impractical--not to mention expensive. Then I read even more about Dr. Sarno's theory of TMS and the book finally ended."
2,It can't be this easy,I'm a Physical Therapist and I think Dr. Sarno's statement that a herniated disc or spondylolysthesis can't cause back pain seems a little far fetched. I've also had back pain for 8 years and I want to believe. I truly do.P.S. It's been three days and my back still hurts. If that changes I'll write a new review.
1,Should be a library rental only,"This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read, and it gives plenty of false hope. Those that say they were healed by the end of reading this book were either suffering from the placebo affect, or didn't have pain to begin with. The doctors theory is sound, however, he offers no advice on how to get better at home. He actually states that his treatment is inpatient for 4-8 weeks and recommends seeing him in NY, or getting in with another doctor that treats TMS. If you think you will be healed by reading this book, you are wasting your money."
2,Waste of time,"After hearing and reading so much hype on Dr. Sarno's techniques, I was very excited to find the book. However, after reading it, I find very little help on how to deal with what he calls TMS. Also, he doesn't really write on how you can tell whether your pain is caused by TMS or some other physical problem.All in all, quite disappointing."
2,"Interesting, but no cure","This is Sarno's first book that describes TMS (tension mylitis syndrome) - his name for back pain caused by stresses in your life. It thoroughly explains his thesis and offers examples of proof, but there are no recommendations on HOW to do solve the problem. His next book, ""The Mind-Body Connection"" is better as it covers all of this material as well as HOW to talk your body out of manifesting your stress and anxiety into back pain."
3,Great Read,It is a great African adventure. It follows two youths from their young age to adulthood. It is a hard book to put down.
3,Too big for my Maltese. :-(,They look to be well made but the sizing seems to be a bit off. I'd recommend buying these from a store where you can try them on your dog first so you know if they will really fit.
4,9 lbs of Fiece chi/terr mix,"Cute on. First pair came broken, contacted 3 times. No communication thru email they just mailed product. Possibly would use them again."
4,Health Care Law Nutshell,"A very good introduction to all major legal issues presented in what is called Health Care Law. Topics covered include: contractual aspects of the doctor-patient relationship (duty to treat, termination of relations); the legal nature of health care organizations; ERISA preemption; medical malpractice and informed consent; anti-trust; and ethical considerations."
5,Clapton at his BEST!!!!!!! This title needs a release....Blu-Ray would be great with lossless audio!,"I have no idea why this has not been released, but there is no time better than now to do. Give a good transfer on Blu-ray and give it lossless DTS-HDMA audio and this would the best music/concert blu-ray ever released!"
5,Eric Clapton - Noth'in But The Blues,"This tape captures the many varieties of blues songs on electric guitar the way it should be done. Perfection. Even the greatest blues writers of all time would say "" Yeah, that's it, that's the way it should be played. Wow!"" This tape should be put in the Smithsonian Institute and preserved for all time. And it should serve as a reference for playing blues guitar.During a lead of what appears to be just 12 bars, a turn-around continues for another 12 bars, and maybe another turn-around continues for another 12 bars of lead guitar. It's this turn-around tension that keeps me on the edge of emotion. These songs can not be done any better!"
4,Really Good. Educational,I'd already seen this on TV and wanted to share it with a family member who has a grandchild with autism. They really liked it and were very grateful for this gift. It's a great source of hope and a really good educational tool.
2,Misleading,"As the mother of an ASD child, I was kind of shocked by how misleading the title of this documentary was. I thought it would (finally) be an expository piece about various people w/autism. This documentary was well-made, but very narrowly focuses on this one individual's weaknesses/strengths and the one method of increasing communication for this individual. Many (most?) ASD kids/adults are not mentally retarded, are not non-verbal, are not living in half-way houses, do not have a team of personal aides, etc. Where are their stories? I realize the title of the documentary came from Sue Rubin's speech, but it would have been more ""fair"" to those of us tuning in to CNN to give it a less general-sounding name."
1,awful not worth the money,I bought this movie and it was the most awful movie for information about Autism. For the money it told me nothing that I have not already been told for a mother just beginning to learn how to deal with Autism. It was not worth the money I spent on it and I do not recommend this to any.
5,The Pioneers,"Bravo to all the pioneers who listen to and support people who have Autism. They are breaking the barriers of silence that limit acceptance and inclusion. Sue Rubin and the producers of this documentary are among those pioneers.I seriously doubt that those who try to debunk this movie and its author, Ms. Rubin, understand what Autism really is. I hope that an increased awareness of apraxia, along with its related conditions as manifest in Autism, can become more widely understood through more attention being paid to the voices of those who experience this condition.Can the person typing be manipulated by the facilitator? Well, perhaps some could who have been conditioned to ""behave"" and follow authority figures at all times. One essential rule taught to beginning users is to not allow that to happen.This film is a precious portrayal of a woman's humanity, her struggles, her dreams, and her indomitable spirit. I highly recommend watching it again and again."
5,That soothes me ...,"After hurricane Katrina has raged in this region the Sound of the Mississippi delta music became all the more precious. Of course ""St. James Infirmary"", the standard ballad for all New Orleans funerals, is represented. It talks about the pain of a man who has seen his wife a last time: ""so sweet, so cool, so fair, stretched out on a long white table"" in the hospital. What a music will arise now, after the dead bodies are ""disposed of"" with so few care. I still have a photo in my mind as a woman (near the flooded Canal Street) shoves her dead husband, whom she has bound on a door, through the water. Only the music with this Mississippi feeling, no further newspaper report, will soothe me in such moments. But if I hear the calming voice of Mississippi John Hurt again - or the infectious energy of Tina Turner - then, I think, it will go on again..."
5,Don't buy Mp3 album,"Just based on the songs in this collection I am giving it a 5 star, excellent compilation. However as a warning, I just bought the MP3 album through the link above and the cd is an entirely different album."
1,"You get what you pay for, this cd is crap","Some of the tracks on here are re-recordings of Coral hits that the Ames Brothers did when their Greatest Hits lp was released by RCA in 1958. The songs are offered here in somewhat crappy sound, with tape dropouts, rechanneled sound, and other things to distract the listener from enjoying the music. Instead of this cd, I would recommend the Sentimental Me: The Best of the Ames Brothers cd on Varese Sarabande, which covers many of their Coral chart hits and other classics for the label, and also the Very Best of the Ames Brothers on Taragon, which takes care of their RCA career, except for the fact that they put Destination Moon on the cd instead of the classic, Stay, which they had to flip a coin to decide which track to put on. They went with the wrong song, honestly...but avoid this crap, get BOTH of the 2 cds ive mentioned here on Varese and Taragon, they CARE about sound quality."
3,Not the original performances,"If you are like me, you prefer the original hits as they were first recorded. This CD, though not horrible, is comprised of re-recordings. You can take it from there yourself."
4,Around the seasons,"Sammy Spider's lesson this time is on the seasons. He sees how the seasons affect the trees. Then in the end they celebrate Tu B'Shvat.As usual, the pictures are colorful and add to the flavor of the story. But unlike the usual Sammy Spider fare, this book talks less about the holiday rituals (of which there are very few) and more about the world around Sammy that eventually leads to an appreciation of the holiday.Missing are the funny ways Sammy gets caught while trying to get in the holiday spirit; but you feel Sammy grow up as the year passes and he learns about trees and what makes them grow and how they survive the seasons."
4,"More about the seasons trhan the holiday, but nice","This book in the Sammy Spider Jewish holiday series for small children (ages 4-6) is really more about the changes of the seasons than the festival of Tu B'Shevat itself, although the festival is mentioned. But since there really aren't too many other rituals associated with this holiday, the focus on tree-planting is appropriate. Sammy Spider watches his human neighbors, the Shapiros, celebrate with fruit and nuts (eating (a tradition for this holiday) and by planting a sapling (also traditional). The colorful paper-cut illustrations the follow the Tree through the seasons, showing the leaves change color, etc., as the Shapiros care for their yard. As a secular presentation of nature with a Jewsih twist, it's a nice book."
5,Unexpected surprise,"This album truly rocks! Eclectic and inventive it never lets up with surprises. Some tracks make you want to drive fast or lift heavy objects (like SEWN or DISTRESS) others want to make you dance around in an odd time (LAZY HALOS, BURLAP) then there's the lounge jazz of MR. DOLPHY... with vibes and a sax. SEE THE BIG BUG. If you like Jawbox, Fugazi, Smart Went Crazy or anything new you will dig this. Way underground but with pop on top."
4,Kaplan Review,Book appears adequate to the task of GRE prep. Kaplan is generally the benchmark for prep books. We'll see how the test goes.
2,ehhh.,"so, sing a powerful song was, is GREAT. this one... not so much. i mean, i can listen to sing a powerful song time and again. the songs are passionate and real and though they're firmly rooted in the band's irish heritage, speak with a wonderful universal quality.villains... is just not so good. at times they sound like they might be close to having a great song on their hands, but then it just falls to pieces. this album sounds like it's trying to hard - like they've forgotten whatever it was that made sing a powerful song such an incredible album.my recommendation, buy 5 copies of sing a powerful song. keep one for your house, one for your car, wear one around your neck a la flavor flav, send one home to your mom, and leave the last one at your local bar in the hands of serendipity. don't even bother with villains.just saw them get blown off the stage in buffalo by a local band named jackdaw."
4,Change of pace,"this is a change of pace for the saw doctors...from the opening dylanesque sound of villians.its not as happy go lucky as previous saw doctors efforts, more horn driven than drum driven.but again, this is one of the most underappreciated bands in the world"
4,"A thought provoking film, one of sci-fi's best movies.",It is a shame this film is not available for purchase. It is one of the best films I've seen on time travel. Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen give good performances. The film shows just how far the Navy has advanced in 30 years. The story moves at a quick pace and has just enough special effects to enhance the story without drawing attention away from it.
3,the final countdown,"it askes the question what if , what if we could stop japan ghow would we be different today. it makes you wonder what if we did have that kind of fire power back then!!!"
1,Fool me once...,"...shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. With that said, let me just add I won't be purchasing this new release (Triumph, HAH! Can't fool the public that easily, PFE!) until I know for certain it's of better quality than the last DVD release."
1,Not a good disc,"If this is the same disc Pacific released before, it's not worth the money. The transfer wasn't enhanced for 16x9 TVs and it looked like someone projected the film on their wall and videotaped it with a camcorder. Blech!"
4,Excellent,"For being an older movie, it is really a good one. It even makes you think about ""What If"" you can go back in time and meet certain people or even change something."
4,"No, not the album by ""Europe""","I first saw this on ABC as a kid, and loved it. Seeing it again now, at 31, I don't find it nearly as interesting but still think it's a fine film. Check out how much young Martin Sheen looks like Charlie Sheen! Watch James Farentino, the TV version of Roy Scheider! And don't miss the surprise ending!"
3,"Great for 1980, cheesy for 2004","I saw this film at the theater as a kid and thought it was great, but when I watched it last night on DVD I was thinking how cheesy. The picture quality is outstanding, the acting is corny, the melodramic music that plays throughout the movie gets on your nerves, special affects going through the time warp hole whatever you call it looks like a bad night in a disco bar in the 1970's. Now for the good stuff, the aerial scenes and scenes on the flight deck I thought were very good, when they first come out of the time hole they don't realize what happened and trying to figure it out was good but then they lose it on the story line. My recommendation; rent it or borrow it, if you have to have it I'd buy a used copy at a good price."
2,A pathetic DVD transfer,I eagerly purchased the DVD version of The Final Countdown but was profoundly disappointed with the quality of the DVD transfer. The VHS version I purchased used from a rental store is of equal or better quality. Maybe the powers that be at Pacific Family Entertainment will get their collective thumbs out of their butts and get someone to clean up the graininess and blur and reissue this movie as a DVD should be. Unless you just can't wait for an improved version don't waste your money on this one.
5,Terrific!,"...this is not a review of the movie, but rather of the DVD quality...I was one of the unfortunate who bought the ""PVE"" version of this several years ago, so I purchased this new ""Blue Underground"" release with some trepidity. That PVE release was some kind of horrid - terrible picture quality and sound. So, I put on the new release from Blue Underground and .... WOW! What a great job! Great picture quality and digitally enhanced DolbyTHX sound! I have the widescreen version, so it is in letterbox format, which I don't have any problem with (I don't own a widescreen TV).If you, like I, saw this many, many years ago and liked it and have wanted to have it in your library, this new Blue Underground release is what you're looking for."
3,Action + SciFi,This is a great mix of science fiction and action. Time travel is one of the big questions and this film gives an entertaining scenario without pretending to give an answer to the currently unanswerable.
5,Definitely a keeper in my private collection.,"Great story line. A clever weaving of fact and fiction. Pricks the imagination by mixing modern-day and pre-Pearl Harbor naval warfare technology. Don't go to sleep, you'll miss it."
1,What a bore!,"The script was terrible. Nobody, including Kirk Douglas, had to stretch themselves to play their parts. Ron O'Neal as the executive officer was very sad to watch. He was a punching bag who would never even dream of speaking his lines if the situation was real life. I spent most of my time laughing rather than being captured by this movie. I think Kirk played a role because of his son Peter was a co-producer. SHAME!"
1,What A Jip!,"Talk about a tease and a waste of time. I saw this in the theaters when it came out and thought then that it was a waste of time. I wanted to like this show, but I couldn't. You want to see the US Navy kick the tar out of the Imperial Japanese Fleet, but they don't. They plan to kick the tar out of them, then don't. Your ready for a can of whip azz to be opened up and it ain't. It's just a huge string along until you get to the point when we're gonna attack and then.....we don't again. BAH! I suppose the writers were either not very creative or were all wrapped up in the Gordian knot of paradox. WELL PARADOX DOSEN'T EXIST! The other point I would make here is how could they make this into a 2 disk movie? What extra's could they possibly show? Something like the director saying ""...and here is where we almost attacked the Japanese fleet...."" Boring! The acting is sub-par also. If you want a great take on time travel and its consequences, read the Time Ships. Now thats a story!"
3,Nice Cult Sci-FI,When this movie came out I Wanted to see it but never made it. THEN I went to rent it & couldn't find it for YEARS!Now that I FINALLY saw it.... Well it wasn't as cool as I remember thinking it would be as a kid.But it IS an interesting story line & plot.
4,Time travel thriller.,"In short, a modern aircraft carrier somehow finds itself in the Pacific just before the attack of Pearl Harbor. One officer aboard the carrier is a history buff who is an expert on the event. What will they do? Allow history to unfold as they know it, or act to prevent a disaster? A solidly entertaining movie that deals with time travel as a moral dilemma but never runs short on action. It has a fine cast and some unique plot twists. I recommend it highly."
5,Mother of all Aircraft Carrier Movies,"I remember the first time I saw it, I was around 7 years old & that day I decided that aircrafts & carriers would be my favorite hobby I have models & now I am a big fan & know a lot of specs about carriers & combat aircrafts I am 24 & still get stoned whenever I catch that movie in the TV I would definitely buy this title whenever it comes out for sale again, this is my favorite movie I am sure it would have been guilty in a big part from me getting enlisted in the US NAVY or Air Force. Excellent Scenery excellent shots, very illustrative I sure more than one person thought some of the features of the NIMITZ were fake when they first saw the movie in the 70's"
3,The USS NIMITZ vs. The Japanese Imperial Fleet,"Kirk Douglass stars as the captain of the nuclear powered USS NIMITZ. But the real star is the ship itself. (sorry kirk).He is backed up by Martin Sheen,James Farentino,Katherine Ross,Charles Durning and in a casting surprise Ron (SUPERFLY) O'Neal as executive officer of the carrier. Basically the Nimitz enters a wormhole and comes out all alone off the coast of Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941. The only thing between her and the approaching Japanese Fleet is air. Who will win? Well the only reason I rated this movie 3 instead of 4 stars was the ending. I found it fraustrating. This movie begs for a remake or a sequel. Imagine an amaercan nuclear attack sub vs. the japanese fleet."
4,Classic,"Oddly enough we are approaching 40 years from when this movie was made. Meaning, part of the theme was that it was made 40 years after Pear Harbor.This is one of my favorite classic films from the 80s. There are some things that I would have liked to be different like more conflicts, but it was still pretty cool. If you haven't seen it, the film is a great Thursday night movie to watch."
2,"A Good Movie , but ....","I really liked this movie and got it on vhs .Took a while to find on dvd , but with a lot of transfers from a film made before dvd tech. it didn't transfer well .Not sure I want to take the chance on the Blu ray version ."
4,Creative History,"Interesting premise on time travel as you actually learn some history of Dec. 7, 1941. My family and I enjoyed it."
2,Save your money ...,"This movie starts out with an interesting proposition. What would happen if a modern class aircraft carrier time-warped back into the midst of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor? Although the movie shows some hope of promise as the plot is developed, the ending falls flat on its face. I think the writers must have written the first 15 chapters of the screen play, then totally ran out of ideas for an ending. Save your money. There are a lot of good war movies and sci-fi out there that are much more entertaining."
2,Save Your Money on the DVD,"I love this move. When I saw it was coming out on DVD in wide screen format I couldn't wait. Upon reviewing the DVD I was greatly disappointed. Color bleed was terrible. The picture quality was no better, if not worse, than the VHS tape I have. The DVD paused in places too. The only thing I liked about it was the wide screen format. It's too bad that they did not put the quality into the DVD. It's a great science fiction movie. Hopefully one day they will do it better."
1,"Great Movie, Horrible Transfer (Blu-ray)","This is a great 80s movie, as many that reviewed it have said. I just finished watching the blu-ray copy I recieved from Netflix and the video quality is horrible. I see that I'm not the first to notice this as many reviewers have remarked on this since 2002. For anyone thinking the Blu-ray copy is any better than previous releases, don't believe it!"
3,Its... meh.,"Heard a lot of good things about this movie from friends, but I can see why it has dissapeared from the horizon of cinema history.The special effects are pretty terrible by todays standards, but it is cool to see all the old navy stuff."
2,the final countdown,"this movie kept me entertained during the duration but left me extremely unsatisfied. here's the whole movie ""go back in time, almost change everything yet change nothing, come back to present day"" that was literally it. very unsatisfied."
3,Seen a lot worse,"Nearer 4 stars for me. This is a fine piece of entertainment that doesn't overstay its welcome (running time = 98 minutes). I've always been a sucker for time travel stories and this is pretty good.This has a good cast, including Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen and Katherine Ross. The story is incredibly unlikely but somehow it works and the ending was a complete surprise to me. Unlike one of the previous reviewers I didn't find the acting/script that bad.OK so I wouldn't buy it at new release prices but at the right price (i.e. cheap) its worth getting and my feeling is that I'm going to enjoy it more when I watch it again."
1,The Final Countdown,"A new ""Final Countdown"" DVD? Where has it been made available to merit 5 stars if it's not released until August 2003?If Triumph is owned by PFE, does this mean we can exchange our other ""TFC"" DVDs for the newer version? How are we to trust anything remotely associtated with PFE anyway? (I'm still sore from being burned by PFE the first time).I think I'll wait until I read the reviews on the new version before committing to any pre-purchase for another beer coaster."
4,Final Countdown,Classic movie with action/suspense/romance. Loved the real Navy pilots interview/comments on the 2nd DVD.
1,And you thought it would be released on time! Hah!,"I'm sorry if all you 5-star reviewers from PFE were optomistic, but as is par for the course at Pacific Family Entertainment, Final Countdown on DVD is once again delayed from its promised re-release date! Same thing happened with the horrible original, and the same is happening to this supposed re-release. Don't worry, though, because if you already own their awful first version, then you shouldn't waste any time on this second one - it's the EXACT SAME as the first one but with new packaging and (possibly) chapter markers. Avoid this dud at all costs unless you like buying VHS-quality drivel on DVD from a sham company."
3,It could have been so much more!!,"Warning: There be spoilers here!!The premise of this movie had the potential to be so much more that what we got.What if, instead of being whipped back to the 1980's by The Storm just as they were about to deal to the Japanese fleet, USS Nimitz in fact did successfully defend Pearl Harbour, wiping out the Japanese Strike Force before they could drop a single bomb or torpedo, and THEN The Storm whipped them back, only, when they got back to the future, things hadn't quite worked out as they had expected... Germany won the war when the Allies surrendered after the Luftwaffe dropped the 'A' Bomb on New York and Los Angeles, and there was a Cold War going on between the USSR and The German European Republic.Now the USS Nimitz must search the seas in a desperate effort to find The Storm to take them back to 1941 in the hopes of undoing the terrible mistake they had made."
4,Final Countdown 2 Disc Limited Edition,"Doesn't have the Limited Edition Number on the back, little upset about that, but over all great movie! And Special Features."
3,An Alright Film,"The Final Countdown was a really good movie. I would recommend it to people that love Scifi and Time Travel movies. I gave it 3 stars because the story line really to me didn't make any sense. They go back to 1941 and they are there for a long time just sending planes up and scouting and there is a few deaths and one American plane shoots down a jap plane and explodes but that is basically it. Torwards the end when they are going to get ready to intercept the japanese they get called back to the carrier and the attack on Pearl Harbor still happens. So what was the point of the movie, they didn't even really do anything. I liked it because I am huge into Time-Travel. I also liked the ending when Katharine Ross/Laurel Scott and James Farentino/Wing Commander Richard T. Owens/Mr Richard Tideman ended up being alive and made a surprise visit with Martin Sheen/Warren Lasky."
1,Not satisfied,We ordered this DVD in English but it came in another language. When I e-mailed them they said if we had opened it we couldn't return it. Luckily we hadn't. We just weren't happy with their service.
4,Great SciFi Movie,"Everyone that liked Philadelphia Experiment will enjoy this also, Great movie and Amazon.com shipped it to me in two days free. I recommend this for your Blu-ray collection. Enjoy"
5,Its All About Timming,"What would you do if you were on board the USS Nimiz today and suddley found yourself and the whole ship back to the day before Pearl Harbor was attacted? Would you stop it?, and change history? Check this movie out, even if you are not into sicence fiction you will enjoy this movie."
3,"Imaginative, but........","The DVD movie ""Final Countdown"" was my first ever Amazon purchase. I saw part of the film years ago on late night TV and always wanted to see it in full but never found it in any local supplier.The film starts really well, and builds up it's imaginative scenario. Anyone with an interest in military history and films would enjoy the proposition of a nuclear carrier, with enough firepower to repel the Japanese strike force which approached the Hawaiian islands on December6 1941, being transported back through time to meet that fleet.Unfortunately no real showdown ever happens and the film looks like the makers couldn't think of an ending, so it just fizzles out (apart from an interesting hook line across time, involving James Farentino). Now imagine if George Lucas or Jerry Bruckheimer had handled this project............"
5,SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.....THE FINAL COUNTDOWN,THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE.....IT HELD YOUR INTEREST THE WHOLE TIME...IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE TO BUY!!!!!!!!!
1,Terrible job of Copying..,"I really hope the copy I received was an exception but somehow I doubt it... When it arrived I thought it might have been a returned item, the packaging was loose and sloppy, like someone had used Saran wrap on it. The movie skipped every minute or so when I tried to watch it. At first I thought I had a problem with my DVD player so I tried it in two others and got the same result.. I will give Amazon credit for their return policy, I was able to return the DVD and get a full refund.."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"A fun movie with good acting from the main roles. The special effects are laughable today but it's great to see the old japanese planes in the air vs the US jets. It's a shame that the big battle works out the way it does, but overall I guess it needs to happen the way it does."
5,"Finest WWII ""What If?"" movie ever ....","Douglas, Sheen and the crew members of the US Navy carrier NIMITZ experiance a weather annomilly, and find themselves near Hawaii on DEC 6 1941!Forced to deal with Japanese fighters and a US Senator, the captain (Douglas) sends his own pilots to assist Pear Harbor on DEC7th, not to change history, but in an attempt to save his crew and ship. Douglas, once again shows his ability as a strong dramatic actor by interacting completely with actual crew members of the USS Nimitz.Sheen, appears as a civilian analist, who finds himself caught between his own priorities, and the welfare of men he does not know. One of Sheen's finest roles of his early career.Movies that should be seen with this one include ""TORA! TORA! TORA!"", ""MIDWAY""."
3,Is it or isnt it?,"Is this a new, remastered version or just the same old thing in a new package? I hope it is; the color and picture quality as well as sound could be fantastic for this DVD in the right hands."
3,The Final Countdown,We'd looked for this for a while and enjoyed it. It's mid-career Kirk Douglas and we enjoyed the plot. :)
2,Review,In German No English Subtitles. I Live in English speaking country and am hearing impaired. Refused to replace item.
3,je cherche,"Je cherche a copier ou acheter ce film en version franais,(Nimitz retour vers l'enfer) communiquer moi si cela est possiblesergus2000@hotmail.com"
5,The Final Countdown,"Good movie for the genre. What If... you had a USA Navy super carrier at Pearl Harbor prior to the Japanese attack!! Imagine the possibilities! This movie is not a big special effects extravaganza but that's what helps it stay 'believable'. A must have for time travel buffs; complete with examples of time paradoxes (like, what would happen if you accidentally killed your own grandfather before he had children) and, luckily, an expert on the era travelled, too! A couple of twists to keep you interested. A great companion movie is ""The Philadelphia Experiment"", another WWII era time travel movie, only going the other direction. Both highly recommended just for the fun of it. Enjoy!! }:o)"
4,Good fun doesn't have to make sense,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and thinking ""Cool, even if it doesn't make much sense"". I decided to watch it again some 20 plus years later and you know what? It's still cool and just alot of fun to watch. Sometimes, it's nice to watch a movie and not have to think too much. If you're looking for something like that, this is your ticket. Besides, the F14's rock."
3,"4 years before ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" there was ... The Final Countdown","I think ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" is better than this movie, but this one came out 4 years before that one. Imagine a US naval fleet being transported back 40 years to the day of the bombing of Pearl Harbor with the potential to change history forever. Essentially this is more brain candy than an action fest but anyone with an interest in maritime themes or fighter jets will love it, especially when F14s are scrambled to intercept the Japanese.The ending doesn't really resolve anything (what could one expect? Nazi America because they never enter the war?... but with a ship like that on their side... oh heck you get the picture, this is brain candy more than anything else....) but at least it leaves you thinking and on top of that there are quite a few surprises along the way. This could have been a lot worse, but wasn't. Worth seeing, but get the Philly Experiment first."
1,I Made the Mistake...,"I made the mistake of buying the PFE release of this title on DVD. It is without a doubt the worst video transfer I have ever encountered. I realize that someone has to take the first step to see if this thing is actually a remastered version. My experience with PFE regarding their level of truth-telling on the phone was miserable, so it will not be me. If it turns out that this is a remaster of acceptable quality, I will buy one but not until I see the proof with my own eyes."
1,Poor Transfer to Blu ray,Great movie but poorly transferd to blu-ray. Some scenes are blury and many have pixelation and other artifacts. Another movie that the studio wants to make money on but doesn't care what the end product looks like. This movie deserved better.
5,Exceptional Sci-Fi,"First of all I like Kirk Douglas, but this film puts a spin on Sci-Fi that is extraordinary. Kirk as the Capt of a modern day aircraft carrier is put in a position to signigicantly change world history by preventing a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
4,The Final Countdown,This is one of the few science fiction movie that will be enjoyed by most people who enjoy adventure movies although not necessarily science fiction.The plot is very interesting and the war side of it makes you think about what could have happened.Hope you get that DVD back
3,Fictional Reallity,"That on famouse day on 7 December 1941 in Pearl Harbour; Would't we all want to change it. This Movie plays very well with this wish. Good movie with a good explanation to various occurances in those two day of December 1941. The oonly contraversion is the existint of The Flight Commander twice on the same day, 6 Dec. 1981 (As the Flight Commander on Deck of the Nimitz and the Rich Industrialist coming to see the departure of the Nimits on her voyage. An impossibility yet very good presented."
2,Disappointing Blu-Ray Quality,"I have both the DVD and just this week received the Blu-Ray version. The HD quality is lacking. Most notably in the hanger deck scenes near the end where it shows Laskey walking to the helicopter when Senator Chapman and Ms. Scott are being taken to Pearl Harbor and again when the bombs are being loaded (same camera angle). In addition, the interior shots during the ship's medical department scenes show a poor quality. The center of the screen is HD but the outer edges (a good portion not just a tiny section) is totally out of focus for the entire scenes of the Japanese prisoner taking a hostage and killing crew members. It is very apparent the scene was either poorly shot or the HD conversion was not completed.The movie itself is fantastic! Blu-Ray quality, in my opinion, should be much better than this giving you are paying more.It is watchable exterior shots are great! But..."
3,oh well,the movie is four stars. the DVD release (PFE: Pacific Family Entertainment) is zero stars. it's pan-and-scan and very poor transfer.
2,"Good value for the money, but. . .","At $9.98 a low-cost item, but as the old saw says, you get what you pay for. It's simply too short and, as a result, not inclusive enough and has nowhere the detail a good Corvette history should have. In fact, I have a better detailed history of America's sports car in an old VHS history I bought a number of years ago. Simply stated, 55 years can't be adequately dealt with in half an hour."
5,A Reader's Gem,"This is one of the more interesting autobiographies of a great mind of the early 20th Century. Entertaining, educational, and if you are of Libertarian persuasion, it is a Must Read.If the word ""libertarian"" is confusing, this will broaden your understanding of a truly libertarian mind."
5,AMBAR,HERMOSA!!!!!!Realmente es una joya musical que deleita el alma y activa todos los sentidos del que lo escucha.*Me fascina María Bethania.*
5,Hi Defg Elgato,It works better than expected. Higher quality images and easy programing of Hi Definition channels.Recommend it highly!
4,Elgato EyeTV,"I have a new iMac and initially EyeTV didn't work at all on it, although it worked on my daughter's older iBook. After I downloaded the software update (2.3.3), it has worked well, although occasionally I won't get sound on the live TV window and I have to reopen EyeTV a time or two to get the sound to come on."
4,Not good for PowerBooks,"This product is fantastic, but only on my MacBook Pro. I missed the fine print telling me that to watch an HD signal I needed a dual G5 or Intel Mac. Since I wanted my old PowerBook (1.25 G4) to be the TV, I'm out of luck. But, the picture is incredible on my Cinema Display and MacBook Pro from the Philips HDTV antenna. I haven't noticed it get hot like other posters, but probably am not using it as much as they are.The software included is quite satisfactory. My only complaint is the size of the recordings. A one hour digital recording was about 4 gigabytes. Seems like a lot."
3,Not unless you have a dual G4 or G5 at minimum,"Was trying to salvage my old Mac Mini G4 as a nifty PVR to view from my LCD TV.Turns out the recording quality is limited to VideoCD (lowest quality) due to the slower processor. This is either something I misunderstood or missed in the details. I thought HD format was the only limitation but apparently it should say DVD quality as well.Display quality at larger window viewer size or full screen gets worse which I am not sure is related. I am also using a HDMI-to-DVI cable and OS X looks fantastic compared to S-Video. So it's not the connection between Mini and TV. Might be the input to the EyeTV Hybrid.Have faith older Macs, according the Elgato's site theEyetv 250 Plusshould be better suited since the encoding is done from the device itself versus software.The Hybrid was still a great concept but unfortunately I still was disappointed that it was not ""fully compatible"" with my old Mini."
5,Works well on my iBook,"I've been using this tuner for about three weeks now and have had no problems. This stick shines for ATSC. If you want to use it with NTSC I'd recommend one with hardware encoding.HD works well enough on my iBook G4 (1.33 Ghz, 1.5 GB RAM). However 1080i streams will stutter a bit, especially if I have too many programs open. The same clip shown on a friends Powerbook G4 (1.2 Ghz, 768 MB RAM) plays perfectly (much better video card). Scheduled recordings have worked perfectly, since there is no encoding of an MPGED stream.The tuner is fairly sensitive, pulling in more stations than other ATSC sticks I've used. I'm within 20 miles of the towers and I can receive most stations with a small indoor antenna. Occasionally I need to move the antenna a few inches back and forth to get a perfect signal."
4,Elgato Eyetv,Elgato Eyetv Hybrid (NTSC)Very easy to install (at least on my iMac G5) and one can either use the stand alone wand or camp a small wand on a corner of your screen. The TV picture can be placed anywhere and sized to suit. Works great in the back ground and jumps to foreground when tapped. Just wish there was some way to get more than 125 channels.
4,Excellent option for a mac!,"This is an excellent product for a mac. It comes with free subscription to titan tv guide and cables for connecting to svideo and composite input. So far i have tried only the cable analog tuner. The picture quality is good though not great. If u need a better picture quality, run it on an iMac or Mac Pro. Notebooks dont have enough juice for this tuner or any other tuner. Overall worth the cost.."
5,TV on an iMac,"I was a little worried at first because I'm an old PC guy and the iMac was my first experience with Apple products. The Elgato Eyetv Hybrid was very easy to setup. I just followed the simple instructions, put in the CD and when it was done, all my channels from basic cable service was setup. Total time 8 minutes.If you have a 24 inch iMac, you must add this device. The image quality is good, remember it's not HDTV and the onscreen guide is easy to use to see what's on.The only downside I have experienced is that you need direct line of site for the remote control to work. If something is in the way, it's inconsistent on how it responds."
4,Works great....most of the time,"Installed on a QuadCord MacPro or MacBook Pro it works great. The DVR feature is great for time shifting my favorite shows, removing the commercials and putting them on my iPod. It does however get pretty warm so make sure there is ventilation where you place it. The included Remote works well as does the MBP Apple Remote.Now for the ""most of the time"" part. If you have the unit ON and the Mac is set to sleep, the Eyetv will wake it back up even if all you are doing is watching a TV show. Also, if you use fast user switching the Eyetv will not respond upon return to your screen. You have to remove it and restart the program. A future update may fix this issue. The ""on screen"" TV show listing is not always correct. I end up checking my cable box to see what is ""really"" on. 4 of 5 stars"
2,"Cool device but poor quality, prone to USB issues","I purchased with the intent of using in my new Mac Mini. Only a 3 days in and I am receiving an error telling me""The EyeTV Hybrid device will not operate because it is connected to a USB 1.1 port"". One quick Google search and I found the article below. Based on how common this issue appears to be I will opt to return my tuner. It's really too bad. When it works it works very well.[...]"
3,Okay but not quite up to speed,"The device works okay if what you want is to watch TV on the Mac.It works unreliably to record shows if you are not there.I tried many a time to use the channel guide recording option to record shows only to get the wrong channel recorded at the correct time.I'm not sure it's the devices fault, or the software's fault or the channel guides fault but remember we buy the Mac because "" it just works'Well this product does not "" just work """
2,Not what I expected.,"It worked, but not very well. I have an iMac 24"" Dual Core 2.3 with 2 GB RAM. The resolution was good ONLY at 720x480, about the size of a 6x4 photo. When you attach it to a cable box it sees it as a single channel. With out the box it will see the analog channels but as you all know they will be gone in 2009 so it will be useless to me then, unless there is an update. All in all not worth the money."
2,Lots of problems,"The product worked out of the box, but they upgraded the software about 2 weeks later, and that produced problems. The electronic programming guide stopped working, and it has been about 2 months and it still has not been fixed. Elgato says the problem is with TitanTV, and TitanTV will not respond to a customer inquiry. Elgato claims to be working with TitanTV on it, but many people have this problem and it is just not getting resolved. Without the programming guide this product is not worth much more than viewing TV real-time. Also, forget HDTV if using this device."
1,Doesnt Work ... Atleast for Me,"Tried it on a macbook, macbookpro, G5 Tower and I get ZERO channels. I live in washington dc area and I dont get a single channel even with a high gain powered antenna. This is going back ..... cya"
1,Canadians beware - no EPG,"Although this may be a perfectly good product, Canadians should beware that there is no working electronic program guide for Canada integrated with any Elegato TV product. There are guides for the US, UK, Australia and even smaller countries, but not Canada. When I emailed support about this flaw they did not directly answer when a guide would be available, so I assume there are no plans to provide a guide for Canadians.I feel ripped off, and warn Canadians not to buy Elegato products."
3,"Great idea, not quite there.","Pros:software is great, easy to usesurprisingly easy set uprecording feature is cool, kind of like tivoremote control works greatCons:picture quality is basically one step above youtubelooks good if you have it half sizebut looks pretty bad full screen"
3,Elgato vs Broadcast TV,"Well, we had high hopes that the content of broadcast Tv would improve if we watched it on our iMac. No such luck. The Elgato unit works fine, but the TV content is still impoverished."
4,Simple and Effective,"This compilation represents much of Aphex Twin's earliest work. All of these songs vividly illustrate the fact that sometimes less is indeed more. For the most part, the tracks on ""Classics"" were put together using little more than a synthesizer (Roland's TB-303), a drum machine, and effects. The result is some of the most compelling electronic music you'll ever hear. It's their stripped-down simplicity that gives these arrangements their tremendous energy. ""Digeridoo"" is a mesmerizing techno song that has no right to be as good as it is, considering that it is only a drum track with an endlessly repeated 303 synth line. The rest of the songs on this collection are of similar caliber."
3,a mixed bag from a great artist,"There are great songs on here... but because it's a compilation, I find the ordering of the tracks to be a bit capricious. This is definitely not a place to start if you are interested in RDJ. 'Didgeridoo' is a stunning gem though... and probably worth the price of the album."
4,An excellent early album,"His music has grown to a sophistication that has overshadowed early works like this, but this music provides a great sampling of the early career of the artist.This is art music. It is created to provide the listener with a personal experience, and it does just that. You are not told what it is about, that is up to you. I love the longer tracks, since that allows the looping to come full circle and morph into a myriad of possibilities.In all honesty, it's his more recent albums that are the true gems, but this is a great album."
1,How can someone sooooo good be Soooooo bad,"Anyone, even one not even remotely interested in idm and electronic music has to admit that aphex twin has definite skill. For those who do like that kind of music, he remains as one of the best, and by far THE MOST varied electronic artist ever. Whether it is ambient, drum and bass, or pure dance tracks, aphex twin is at the top of his game. THUS, when I heard of his classics album, I figured it would be a wondrous compilation of his most varied and best work. Instead it is a mix of the annoying, industrial, hard music which Richard makes just to annoy people. HOw could these be his classic tracks, they are his WORST tracks. Besides polynomial-C, and annalogue bubblebath, this is a compilation of some of the worst and hardest to listen to idm I have ever heard."
2,Give us the original in color!!!,"I read this when it was originally published and it was one of the best series ever printed and then I take a brief look at the black and white reprint shown here and I am aghast!!The only reason it gets two stars from me is that the story is worth the read, otherwise this looks loke a cheesy attempt by Marvel to make a few extra bucks.Do yourselves a favor and find this in color and get true enjoyment from the artwork, but if you are just casually curious you can pick this up for at least a good read."
5,Discover them!,"Mr. Charles E. Finsley give a great picture of the Texas contributions to dinosaur paleontology. Doris Tischler drawings give you not only posture, but feeding habits, behavior and a dynamical perspective of how the Dinosaurs lived. Mr. Langston experience gives a great complement with his participation. If you like dinosaurs, you'll finish this book in just two days! but you'll use it all your life."
2,New format,I don't like the new format of the magazine.I have been a reader of Guitar Player since it's first issue. The new format is to corporate in design. In order to cram more information into each article it has started to use a hardly legible micro-print in the sidebars. Also there are to many articles about no talent wankers with a 3 chord vocabulary. Come on guys! just because some snot-nosed teen is tone deaf doesn't mean you have to cater to their non-exisent musical taste. I will probably not re-new my subscriptipn for these reasons.
2,Advertisers Rule!!!,"I've been reading this magazine since it's inception in the late 60's. In that time it went from a good magazine to a great magazine. When Jim Crockett left as editor in the late 80's the magazine's content went into a tailspin that continues to this very day-especially in the hands of Music Player Publications. If you must subscribe to this magazine, just take out a one year subscription. The magazine covers will simply be a rehash of the same artists year after year-9 out of twelve issues anyway. If it's glossy pics of guitars and gadgets you're salivating for, this just might be your mag as they comprise 50-60% of it."
2,Guitar product reviewer....,"Wow...There's a lot to see in this magazine...A lot of product reviews and a lot of advertisements. If You're looking for something to improve your playing, this is not the right source."
4,"Excellent, for the money","Not bad for a fifteen dollar a month mag. Nothing in the way oftranscribed music, but hey if your still reading tab then you shouldn't be reading this mag to begin with, it definently is geared more towards experienced players. But we all gotta start somewhere right? Anyway, gearbox was my personal favorite as far as columns go."
5,There must be some mistake....,"I would like to comment on Brandon's review of GUITAR PLAYER. I believe that he is reviewing the wrong publication, because GUITAR PLAYER does not have any song transcriptions in it. In addition, there isn't a column called ""Riff Box"", which he mentioned in his review. He is thinking of a different guitar publication. (Not to mention that the editor of GUITAR PLAYER looks more like someone who would lend his lunch money to someone else, rather than have his lunch money stolen.)GUITAR PLAYER is loaded with great articles and interviews, in addition to the most reliable gear reviews for those who are interested in purchasing guitars, amps, effects, etc.Please look on the cover of your magazine, Brandon. It's not GUITAR PLAYER. (It's something else.)Isis"
2,"Good Magazine, Poor service","Let me start by saying this was a great guitar magazine in its time(ten years ago). However,the people who run the buisness aspect of the subscription department are either morons or they just don't care. In November 2001 I ordered a subscription for myself and one for a friend plus a ""Beatles Gear"" book. After contacting these folks over a dozen times by phone or e-mail concerning not receiving ""Beatles Gear"", I never got the book. Each time I e-mailed them I would get a response to the effect that ""your free gift will arrive in 8 to 9 weeks."" Well, in the first place it certainly wasn't free, and secondly the book still hasn't shown up, and it is past the middle of April 2002. There has been a problem similar to this with my subscription at least three times over the years. Pass over this mag and get ""Guitar One."""
3,Too much lipstick for too little pig,"They used to have comprehensive gear comparisons but I guess they've all succumbed fearing that they'll lose ad $ if they give something an honest but bad review. So you can pick any of the 3 main guitar mags and it's mostly putting different lipstick on the same pig. What I miss most is the shootout gear reviews which would give you a consumer reports/pcworld style rating on amps and guitars and effects so the reader could see features each had side by side. Now all three major mags seem to be pedaling to consumers instead of musicians. I have yet to see any comparison reviews of pod, vox, digitech, behringer modelers. Boutique amps guitars effects versus stock production and what sounds good, is affordable and easy(or not)to get serviced. GP's best of the 3."
2,Unreliable,"There are no footnotes, no index, no bibliography, no photos. Details and comments have been added that do no seem justified, and there's no way to check them. In fact, the book appears to have been cobbled together rather quickly from the transcripts of the trials, with unwarranted asides throughout.Any serious reader of the first great murder trial in the 20th Century would be better served by far in reading the books by Michael Macdonald Mooney and Gerald Langford, especially the latter's ""The Murder of Stanford White."""
1,"You Aren't a Singer, So Don't Sing","This album is a disaster. It shows what the JB's CAN'T do without James Brown. Why they try to write and then sing lyrics when they are solid jazz musicians and pioneers of the instrumental sounds of funk is beyond me. Buy the ""Funky Good Time Anthology."""
5,This is really a great book!!!,"This book is amazing, profound, magic, poetic , full of wisdom. By using specific exercises, meditations and reflections you will discover yourself and realise your potential. It definitely changed my life!!!"
1,New York Rangers Shirt by Reebok,Several years ago I purchased New York Ranger t-shirts on NHL.com and returned them because the lettering was noticeably peeling off in the bag. I thought this time would be different. But it is not. I have a wide variety of t-shirts with lettering on them. Usually the lettering fades over time. But the NHL t-shirts are different. The lettering is peeling off almost right out of the bag. Two washes into owning the shirts and you can already notice gaps in the letters. This product is not worth the money.
4,A bit tight even in wide.,"I am a 13 in most shoe sizes but a 13.5W to 14W in most of my boots. I ordered these in 13W since I had heard they ran a bit tight. I still feel them pressing in on my small toe while I walk. It might stretch a bit to be perfectly comfy, we'll see so I'm going to keep them. However I think next time I will try out the next size up.They are a nice looking shoe however in the short time I walked around the house in did notice they have no traction on my carpet when you go to ""push off"" in your step. Don't think it will be an issue in most situations, just more of an observation."
3,Lots of advertsing. Not as many decorating tips as anticipated.,"I enjoy leafing through this magazine, however there are alot more ads than I had anticipated and not very many photos or articles sharing decorating tips. All in all this is a magazine I enjoy skimming through however it just doesn't seem to contain anything that holds my attention or wows me. I would probably try a different subscription when this one runs out."
5,My Favorite,This magazine has replaced all others as my favorite design magazine! I even bought a gift subscription for my Mom and see enjoys it as much as I do. She remembers it from when it first came out and says it used to a stuffier publication and was amused when I told her that I read it. Whomever redesigned the layout for this magazine did an excellent job!
3,"a lot of adds, not articles","i ordered this for a $5 amazon special for inspiration and tips. it's full of adds and uninteresting articles. it has some nice images. I wouldn't pay more than $5/year and i don't plan on renewing. it is, however, awesome that amazon runs specials for $5 magazines. it was worth the five bucks to give it a try."
1,Will not renew this one...,"Some great pics of interior design... but not enough to pay for this subscription. They showcase alot of items for sale and where to buy, if you are on a budget (like me) everything is WAY TOO PRICEY. If you're looking for high end examples to knock off, its good for ideas in that respect. Seems to come w/more ads than content. This would have to be my least favorite magazine I've ever subscribed too. Very disappointed."
5,LOVE IT,"GREAT PRICE, RELIEABLE DELIVERY.... LOVE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL. AND THE EASY WAY TO ORDER IT THRU AMAZON!!"
2,House Beautiful,"I subscribed to House Beautiful magazine form Amazon on November 30, 2009 and as of today Febuary 1, 2010 I haven't yet received it. I'm very disapointed with Amazon and House Beautiful magazine. I would like someone to email me an anwser!"
3,What's the delay?,"I already know I love the magazine, but I don't understand why it takes 3 months to get the first issue! I ordered it on September 20th and Amazon is telling me I won't get it until December 8th. Wha...?"
3,More Ads Than Anything,"I just received my first two issues yesterday. This magazine is page after page of advertisements. The thing that really bugs me about that is - companys run the same advertisements in the same magazines again and again so two issues are virtually the magazine since there are very few articles.For some reason even the articles in this magazine get lost because they have the same look as their ads. One article was suppose to be tips from over 125 top designers - what it really was - 125 designers listed with addresses and phone #s and a couple of tips on each page of that section.I'm really disappointed. For a GREAT magazine, try Southern Living. For a REALLY GOOD magazine, try Better Homes and Gardens."
4,"Useful content, good ideas!","I got this magazine and ""Dwell"" after buying a new-to-me house and needing ideas. What a contrast! This magazine has lots of useful ideas: most of the furniture is not outrageously expensive, and for many of the paint jobs they give you the details on the paint so you could walk into the paint store and buy exactly the same paint they used. I actually prefer the aesthetics of ""Dwell"" (mid-century modern is my heroin) but their ideas are completely unachievable, expensive, and vague. HB is a refreshing contrast. I've already applied some of their ideas to my own home."
1,Watch out for Hearst magazine scams.,"While I love the publication, please watch out for Hearst Magazine scams. I received a renewal invoice/letter regarding another Hearst publication, Popular Mechanics which I have never read, ordered, or received. [...]When I emailed Hearst (there is no phone number for customer service) to let them know that I did not order this publication, they sent the following reply: ""We have received your renewal order. When payment of [...] is received, service will continue through 12 issues.""I'm not sure what part of ""I did not order this magazine and do not want this magazine"" they did not understand. Terrible company and it is unfortunate that they take advantage of their customers in this way.Hearst is the worst."
3,Ideas Galore,"These magazines are packed with lots of ideas for decorating a room, a house, a yard, but half of the magazine has too many advertisements."
2,House Beauriful,It is not what I expected. I defintely do not want to renew for another year. There are a lot of magazines that give you tips and ideas for your home. Do not renew.
1,Careful about renewal. I,I didn't want to sign up for another year but was told because it would expire in Jan. I had to. I wasn't given any notice until Dec.! The Christmas issue was horrible and that did it for me.
4,Magazine Beautiful,Works great on Kindle Fire and the content is timeless and helpful. The only thing that would make it better is to have some sort of index available across all owned volumes.
4,Subscription at a great price!,I received my first 2 issues and the subscription price was great. I wouldn't have subscribe if it was more than $5 dollars.
4,I enjoy this magazine!!,"Beautiful photos and articles, I was so excited when it arrived. Can't wait until the next one."
2,No for me,This may be good for someone else. But it was not for me. I think I got one and have no idea when or if the next one will come. Not a magazine I look forward to coming.
2,it's been over 30 days and i've heard nothing and have no magazine,"how long does it take, over 30 days??? no word, no nothing from the co."
5,House Beautiful - Don't decorate a house without it,"House Beautiful is packed with useful ideas on home decorating that even a novice can understand and put into practice. The publication is easy to read and provides excellent ideas from Kitchen to Closet. If you are thinking about redecorating your home, or furnishing a new one, House Beautiful will provide all the help you need."
1,Non-receipt of magazine,"I have orderd House beautiful magazine since September 18, 2006 and to date, January 8th I have not receive such subscriptions. I would like someone to look into this please."
2,Kind of like a bubble-headed debutante...,"It's very pretty to look at, but I just can't get serious about it. To be fair, this may be because I'm not a professional designer with a six-figure budget. When I saw $20 paper clips and $10,000 armoires featured in their ""The Best"" recommendations section, I can't shake off the feeling of elitist snobbery, and it makes me feel all dirty inside. Plus, I scored an embroidered elephant pillow at our town dump's swap shop for free - they had it listed for $325. I'll be taking my year's worth of magazines to the Goodwill, where there are undoubtedly better and more interesting ""finds."""
2,"Too ritzy, fancy, schmancy!","This magazine is chock full of of over-priced home decor that the average person wouldn't be able to afford, especially in an economy like ours. I recommend ""This Old House"" which has a lot of real-life decorating/remodeling solutions at a very nice price...."
3,beauty and advertisements,I just got my first issue. There is great beauty in the designs however there are a lot of advertisements. I do have great hope for this magazine and hope it comes true! I can't wait for more to come.
1,DON'T,"I wrote this review for my Harpers magazine as well. Don't bother ordering Hearst magazines. Both Harpers Bazaar and House Beautiful come intermittently, late, or not at all. I see the magazine I would like on the shelf, and wonder if or when I will receive my copy. I finally just canceled. what a shame."
1,I do not want automatic anything,I was not aware of any automatic renewal for my subscription to House Beautiful and certainly do not wish to pay now for something that can't even be used for another full year. Please cancel this at once.
2,You can find better..,"Better Homes & GardensIf you want a magazine that is much much BETTER than Beautiful House, check out Better Homes and Gardens!!!!!!! TRUST ME!"
1,Grandma's magazine,"I have recieved 3 issues so far. The only feedback I have is this seems to be a magazine designed for people 70+. The interior design showns very old antiques cluttered with lots of unrelated stuff. The recent issue introduced a bathroom make-up reminded me the houses built in the 60s.I perfer to see a bright, clean, and modern view of the houses. Maybe this magazine is not for me, however, I don't know how to unsubscribe it if it is bought through Amazon."
3,Finally -- More Vampire Files,The Dark Sleep is indeed an excellent addition to The Vampire Files. I've read them all and really thought the last few before The Dark Sleep were getting a little stale -- they seemed to have the same story line over and over. Now we get to learn a good deal more about Escott and see the friendship between the somewhat bumbling Jack and Escott grow deeper. Escott has a big secret and something terrible to live with from his past and it all comes out here.And lots not forget Bobbi!!
1,Not my favorite,"I read the other books in this series and although they were a bit bland, I did find them somewhat enjoyable. That was a few years ago. I picked up The Dark Sleep two days ago and attempted reading it. I made it to page 90. I normally can finish a book in a day, sometimes two. By the time I reached page 90 of this one I was asking myself ""So what's the conflict?"" I found no major conflict in this story. How can you have a story without conflict? Perhaps something will come up later on, but I'm just too bored with it to read on and find out. As far as I'm concerned, every great author knows you should introduce the problem early on to hook the reader. I'm SO not hooked!Sorry, but I can't imagine myself ever returning to this series or author."
2,Amateurish,"This writer needs an editor, at least for the Kindle version. The numerous editorial flaws detracted from the rather uninteresting and predictable mystery."
3,Only for certain cages.,The product came on time and was fine but it doesn't attach to my cage. By looking at how it should attach to the sides I can see how it would work with some but not all. I'd just check that yours is compatable before you purchase.
5,AWESOME bunny litter box!,"This has saved me so much time and money! My bunnies are Mini-Rex sisters who share a 2 level cage in my house. I was having to change the drop pan shavings every 3 days, & stinky, EWWWW! This litter box fits in the corner & it's easy to put in & take out, THEY USE IT. I dump it every other day to every day. My cage shavings now last 2 weeks so I'm using a fraction of what I used to. Very happy with it!*I would have liked blue, or to pick my color though, mine is white."
1,Pointess to hang up,"The Ware Plastic Lock-N-Litter small pet pan is horrible. I got it to hang up, as my rats like a lot of floor space and so I thought this would be awesome. Well, I hung it up and then gently pressed on the plastic bottom to see how much weight it could hold. It warped. It has NO stability to it and just bends back against the cage. So, I let my rats just play in it for a while while looking for tips and tricks and I heard a loud BANG. I look over and the thing has popped off the holders and dropped down to the bottom. My rats are now terrified of it. If I wanted a litter pan to just sit on the bottom of the cage, I would have just used a tub."
3,A little too big,"I have yet to use it since the rats that I bought it for don't arrive until October, but when I took it out of the box it was a lot larger than I thought it would be. The seller didn't list the dimensions online but it did say good for rats so I got it. It arrived very timely which was nice but I'm considering returning it due to it's large size. I would recommend for rabbits and ferrets yes, maybe even guinea pigs, but for two rats it may be pushing it. it is basically going to take up a good portion of their cage, which wasn't what i was looking for."
5,Take a swim in this pond!,"I truly loved this book! How rare to read something that feels like you are reading parts of your own life. This author pulls no punches when it comes to sharing the truth about what it is to be single, over 30 and dating in New York City. Her blunt honesty is so refreshing, it's hard to put the book down. Hope there are more installments of Karrie's journey."
5,The Perfect Summer Beach Book...,"...but be careful, you might get a sunburn because it's hard to put down! Whether you're sitting by the ocean or Karrie's enormous pond, you'll definitely enjoy the new adventures of actress-turned-dating-expert, Karrie Kline. What a perfect ending! BRAVO! And, it goes without saying, ENCORE!"
3,L'age ingrat,"This is one of the later Jean Gabin movies (1964 - he died in November 1976)and was certainly very funny in this period. Especially the actor Fernandel gave it a humorous touch. You must be familiar with the French regions to understand why there is always a ""fight"" between people from the north (e.g. Brittain) and the south (""midi""). That's what makes the charme of this movie: The confrontation between two cultures. The story as such is very simple: Two young people intend to marry and therefore the family of the girl living in the north is visiting the couple who lives in the south. The different characters - especially of the male family members lead to comic situtations. Funny is the fact that the real son of the main actor plays the son in the film (Fernandel and his son Franck Fernandel).All in all this is a family movie and you must be a real ""Gabin"" or ""Fernadel"" fan to enjoy this DVD.L'age ingrat / Le couturier de ces dames - Fernandel Boxset 2DVDL'age ingrat"
3,With humility,"There aren't enough readings, though the readings and accompanying assignments that do exist in the text are very conducive to learning. The informationin the book and the writing style should be more concise in my humble opinion as a Comp II teacher.Thanks."
5,"And if I can, anybody can!!!!!","I tried everything: patches, gum, cold turkey - you name it, I tried it, and still I smoked like a [chimney]. But this book helped me kick the habit and beat the craving. It was 5 years ago last April that I had my last death stick and I have never felt better. No more hacking cough, no stinking of foul smoke and no more shelling out crazy money just to then literally send it up in smoke. This was the best money I have ever spent. There is also no truth in the rumour that Eddy's back on the tabs."
2,NOT for relaxation,"Save your money if you buy this CD simply for relaxation. There are a lot more choices better than this one. The music is slow, but they are not soothing and they are not attractive. The ""For Relaxation"" series is a large series. And I would say this series produce both good and bad quality CD. I would recommend you to try Bach for relaxation, Chopin for relaxation and guitar for relaxation. These three CDs are the best in the series. While apart from this CD, also DO NOT try Tchaikovsky for relaxation as this is also not a good one for relaxation. The music are sometimes too sad."
1,I want your money,This is an obvious attempt to make one buy the same album twice. It is easy to blame a faceless record company but musicians are ultimately responsible for what is released with their names on it. Jerry needs money buy me.
4,"Did it need to be a double at all? Still good, though..","I think Roadrunner, the record company, was right in releasing this in single-disc form, especially after looking at the track listing and seeing that all of my favorites from this double comprise the single-disc. Of course, that album didn't include Pig Charmer, What It Takes, and the creepy Feel The Void, all great tracks in their own right! I don't really like some of the samey-sounding, thud-y riff rock stuff on here as much as when Jerry creates an ably creepy atmosphere on songs like Psychotic Break and Solitude. If you're a Chains and Jerry fan perusing this album and are curious, then this or at least the single-disc are highly recommended."
5,Possibly Jerry's best work,"This album is spectacular throughout. The eleven songs not on the original release are, in my opinion, better than most of the ones that made the first cut. You'll find some of the songs (""Siddhartha"" and ""Pig Charmer"" most often for me) running through your head all the time. ""31/32"" is a soft, emotional masterpiece, along the lines of ""Gone"" (also on here) and ""Hurt A Long Time"" (from Jerry's first CD, Boggy Depot). ""Hurts Don't It?"" is an instrumental somewhat reminiscent of Alice's ""Whale & Wasp"" except heavier, with no violins.The bottom line is that I'm not sure that this isn't better than Alice. Saying that feels sort of like a betrayal, since Alice has been my favorite band since '95, when Tripod (the self-titled CD) came out. In any case, this is the best album to come out in at least the last five years, and it was worth all the three years or so that Jerry spent writing, recording, and trying to get it out there for us."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"It's a real shame Road Runner Records refuses to promote one of the greatest guitarists of our time. Jerry Cantrell has come back with a vengence to put all of the Alice-in-Chains clones in their place, and he succeeds briliiantly with this masterful collection of heartfelt songs, breathing new life into rock. I bought this immediately after having previously purchased the first volume that came out earlier in the year, and I can say that the new set of songs is well worth the two-disc price."
5,Outstanding!!,"I loved ""Boggy Depot"" so I figured I'd give ""Degradation Trip"" Volumes 1 and 2 a try. Wow, Mr. Cantrell certainly didn't disappoint me with these two outstanding CD's.Without a question, DT is a bit heavier than Boggy but hey, that's right up my alley. Sure, some songs are stronger than others but the overall product is awesome.If you loved Alice in Chains, you'll love the ""Trips"". Thanks, Jerry, for many hours of listening pleasure."
1,Terrible Re-makes,"If your hoping these are the original recordings that you used to hear on the radio, they are not. These are all re-makes and you will be very disappointed ."
1,Piece of junk,Bought this to remove a stripped screw from a television circuit board. Didn't work at all. Save your money or look for another set.
4,Screw Extracted!,"Bought this tool set to extract a M1.7x9 phillips screw that I damaged.I extracted the screw after about 20 minutes of effort.I initially use the extractor that ""fit"" the rounded hole (that used to be the ""+"" of the phillips head),but later selected the largest diameter extractor for better leverage.The larger diameter extractor slipped initially, but the sharp edges was able to dig in enough and the screw came loose shortly afterwards.The shape of the extractors teeth are saw-toothed.I was thinking that it might work better if the teeth were angled to provide more friction in the counter-clockwise direction.Anyways, the bottom line is that the screw came loose.Now to find a M1.7x9 replacement screw..."
2,Leaves your hands blue,"For a product that is designed for extracting tough screws, it's bound to experience some firm gripping.After successfully extracting a single screw, I found the blue had rubbed off on my hands. Strange design choice, to say the least.I may use these again if I absolutely need to, but they are certainly not my first choice from my kit.Pros:- They do work, for the most part- Made in USACons:- The blue easily rubs off onto your hands- Plastic back ends- Cheap storage pouch"
5,Did the job!,"I had a small screw head stripped in my MacBook Pro (mid 2010) edition while trying to pull out the optical drive to replace it with a Data Doubler. Unfortunately the screw head that stripped was buried deep in some plastic. It took me several attempts with different sizes but eventually I was able get the screw out! I had previously tried super glue, using an exacto knife, many other things. I'd recommend this as a try for anyone trying to get a screw out with a stripped head!"
1,Worthless ... Don't waste your money,"Bought this to use on laptops and other electronics...... Failed the first time I had a stripped screw....made it even worse. Also, the metal is very cheap. I saw that it was made in USA but I seriously doubt it. Looks like Chinese metal. Don't waste your money!"
5,Worked when nothing else did,"All I wanted to do was remove my MacBook Pro's DVD drive and install a data doubler. It was supposed to take 20 minutes.Two #00 screws inside the laptop would not budge. The more I tried, the more I stripped the heads until I could getno grip using my screwdrivers. I tried glue, I tried solder, I tried needle nosed pliers. I even tried drilling them out.Then I all but gave up, and started looking for something that might, somehow, maybe, remove the screws,and came across this product mentioned on some forum, and ordered it as a last resort.... 10 minutes later, (admittedly, I had to apply some serious force in order to get traction) I had both screwsremoved and the new HDD installed. I can't rate this product high enough!"
5,Great Buy,"Had a stripped screw on my laptop, local store wanted over $40 to remove it. Ordered this for $21.80 removed the screw in 2 minutes. I Would recommend this item to everyone"
1,Fingers Stained Blue - Hard to Grip - Did Not Work,"I really wanted to remove two stripped screws from the interior of my Macbook Pro. Unfortunately after significant effort the Moody tool set did not work. Your mileage may vary. These will not work for every stripped screw. I had bad luck I guess.The screw bits are well manufactured and seem like they will last for as long as you need them. However, the blue handles are extremely bad. First of all they are too thin to get any grip. Second of all they leave a nasty blue paint stain on your skin. At least they were made in the USA, so it's hopefully not Chinese lead paint, but who knows. Also the metal clips are super annoying and get in the way so I took them off.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in this toolset. For me, this was a waste of twenty bucks. For you, it might not be. Who knows. Best of luck.PS. Apple is partly to blame for using screws made out of such soft metal!"
1,POS,"If you have a stuck screw, and it did not come out with APPROPRIATELY sized screw driver, so that you stripped it, there is NO WAY these flimsy things will help you! The extractors are just 4 triangular tips, which are sharp, initially, but become dull, or deform right away when you try to get the stubborn screw out, and need to apply some force on the tool to bite.Those, for whom this worked, likely did not have right screw drivers in the first place.If you got a screw which is already stripped, and you have no idea as to why, well, maybe then this will work. But I would try a proper screw drver first, as it will bite in better than this.On the positive, screw drivers in the set are good, and their sizes for some reasons are slightly different than the ones in my main microscrewdriver set. So they might come in handy one day for another tough case."
4,working well MAC BOOK PRO,This tool set is so perfect that it worked smoothly. it is perfect. i had to change atleast 4 sets of tools before i could start using this.
2,did not work for me,"bought this tool to extract the stripped screw of my Honda remote entry FOB. Didn't work for that purpose at all. Eventually I had to drill the screw out and damaged the thread. The tool was not designed as a screw extractor (i.e. a reverse drill bit type design). Unless the screw is made of really soft material, this tool will not work. I gave it two starts because the included two screw driver are of good quality. But that's not what I paid for."
2,Would not recommand,I bought this to work on removing a knife handle panel. The screw driver broke soon as i started to use it. The screw extractor did not work. It was money wasted!
5,Worked great for getting a screw out of a laptop screen.,they work great for pulling screws out of laptops that need repair. screws are cheap so as long as I can get them out I can fix the laptop with new screws. these worked awesome and there are so many different sizes.
2,Not a tool for broken guitar headstock guitar tuner screws.,"First off, they seem well made, and the blue color is very nice and the screwdrivers are great, but these screw extractors will not work to remove a broken tuner screw in a a guitar headstock. The business end of the extractor is a hollow tube machined with tiny teeth, they go dull almost immediately when you use them, they won't bite in enough to get a grip on the metal to back the screw out, the tool material is just not hard enough. All in all a very disappointing tool. I read the other review from someone with a similar guitar screw problem, still thought it was worth giving it a try, but as the other review said, these don't work for that. If your problem is a broken tuner screw, find another solution, maybe a left handed 1.5 or 2mm drill bit is the ticket, but this isn't, I'm still looking for a solution."
2,Screw Extractor,"I like the different miniature screw drivers. But main reason I bought this was to extract a badly stripped screw head from my laptop. Unfortunately using the screw extractor did not work for me at all, if anything made it worse. I ended up having to use a power drill with small tip which helped."
1,Joke and a scam for 20 bucks for some poor guy in the US,"Bought this set to take out a series of screws in a nvidea graphics card to install a liquid cooling system. Not only did the screw driver help strip the screws, the 'stripped screw extractor heads' BECAME STRIPPED FROM THE STRIPPED SCREW HEADS. This product is a complete joke for any amount of money. I highly urge customers to NOT buy this product and to consider the other review higher than a 1 star a marketing sham."
2,May work for you....,"Really, I mean really! wanted these clever devices to work. They did not work in my application - repair of an iPhone.Problem: Not small enough to handle the small screws in an iPhone 4S.Positives:Made in U.S.SmallStrong and high quality"
2,Did not work for me,These screw extractors ended up stripping the screws in my macbook pro further. Maybe I need more practice. . .
3,decent,use these only once they work only if press really hard down with them.. wasnt worth the price. I wouldnt reccommend buying this
5,iPhone or iPod stripped screws? GET THIS!!,"Easily got a completely rounded screw out of iPhone. the local ""Apple certified"" shop couldn't even do it! These tools are actually Made in the USA!"
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this to remove a stripped out screw from a laptop. With the good reviews it had, I was very surprised that the screw extractors didn't remove the screw. Talk about a waste of $20!"
3,Meh,"I was surprised at the ""cheapness"" of this set. The image makes the set look much more sturdy. The caps on the drivers are cheap plastic and I imagine will not last me very long. This rating is based mainly on the ""feel"" of the product and not its functionality."
2,not pleased,does not work for me i had some stripped screws on a cell phone and did not work at all and this was the only reason for purchasing this product.guess will just have to drill it out
4,a favorite,"Glamour is one of my favorite mag's because its not ridiculous like Cosmo. I can't stand Cosmo. Glamour is a very girly magazine that focuses on trends, celebs, beauty, fashion, it also has how-to articles which is my favorite section in Glamour and they also include intelligent articles on health, finance, career, fitness, etc. There is a sex section but its not sex-obssessed like Cosmo is and Glamour doesn't have ""please your man"" articles. It seems more equal. Its a great fashion mag and if you're into this kind of stuff then I suggest Glamour because it seems more balanced than other mag's out there."
3,It's seen better days,"As others have said, the quality of this magazine has gone down. It still has some good articles on health issues, careers, and other important topics of interest to women. The pictures are great; if you're interested in fashion it's better than Cosmo (though not quite as good as Vogue). The new editors are too focussed on sex and relationships, though. There's more to most women's lives than our relationships with men. Still more worth reading than Cosmo, though."
3,Good source for makeup.,"Glamour Magazine is a good source for makeup, hair and skin care. If you like to browse, there is page after page of flawless teens, gorgeous young women and sexy guys advertising products from A-Z. The magazine is obviously targeted for teens and women under 30. The majority of articles...don't subscribe for the articles!"
3,"Nice read, but...","I used to buy Glamour when it looked interesting and decided to subscribe to it now in order to save money. I ordered it in mid November and just received the first issue today. What really irritates me is that I received the December issue today- although the January issue is already in stores (and I had already bought the December issue). So although I like the magazine, the subscription is off to a bad start..."
2,annoying,"I have purchased a subscription to this magazine 3 times.I have NEVER received all 12 of the issues. I always got 8 or 9. I contacted glamour several times and never got any help. It was very frustrating. I do like the magazine, but I gave up on ordering it."
4,One of the better ones in the genre,"As a young women's magazine, it does a good job of balancing the ""essentials"" (sex, fashion, career advice, health) while providing humor. Definitely less focused on the how-tos of sex than some similar magazines, which I prefer. Great at covering recent, relevant, health issues."
5,Finally a magazine for real women,"I stopped buying and ordering magazines because it seemed all they ever told you were things to do for your ""man"".Glamour actually has articles that make you think and make you laugh.Great mag for those who want more out of life than how to please their partner."
5,"great service, great magazine, great price","always love GLAMOUR, better price than subscription renewal or new subscription at $10 a year with 2-year subscription, no extra handling fee, very fast delivery, less than 3 weeks"
4,A great magazine!,"I love Glamour! This has to be my favorite magazine of all times! Granted the ads drive me nuts but I love the Do and Don'ts and all the clothes. I am a shopping mogul! This magazine is great for showing new trends and I love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way. I also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that I am interested in. I read Glamour almost from cover to back! I rarely skip articles! If you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you!**I have noticed a change over the last year in the magazine, but it is not terrible.**"
4,"Good mag, good price","Glamour is one of the only two women's magazine's I subscribe to. The content and layout is always interesting albeit a bit predictable, and the majority of the magazine is advertisements (like most magazines these days). But the low price makes it a worthwhile subscription."
2,too many ads,there's too many ads and not enough articles. Self magazine and marie claire are better for this reason.
2,Save your money for a different magazine,"I started ordering Glamour 2 months ago, and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me. There are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable. Ladies, my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..I dont recommend Glamour at all."
4,First Amazon Magazine Subscription,"I signed up for Glamour through one of Amazon's magazine deals. Was very simple and I have received my first month's copy; I'm very happy with the service. My only concern is in stores the current month's Glamour is out and I have not received it yet-not a big problem, I know it takes time."
1,Where is my magazine???,I ordered a gift subscription to Glamour magazine on November 30. Today is February 4 and the recipient still has not received the first issue. What is up with that???? I'm very disappointed in how long this process is taking!!
3,Canceled,Your system would not let me cancel this order so the bank cancel the payment you entered without permission!
4,mehran review,I like this magazine very much and I believe that this magazine can be a very powerful resource for solvinf women's today problems.
3,The Magazine Diva says.......,I suggested on my site to share the subscription price with a friend. This mag has a few good ideas but no exactly on the pulse of my life.
3,Glamour Away,I purchased this for my daughter and she has not received an issue yet...so no review is better than a bad one.
1,Ugh. There's a reason why I cancelled my subscription.,"I used to LOVE Glamour. It was great combo of frivolous fashion/girly stuff and great, serious, informative articles. I was a subscriber who faithfully read issue from cover to cover.A few years ago, I thought I had been delivered a Cosmopolitan by mistake. To my great sadness, I found that this was not the case. Glamour great editor, Ruth Whitney, had been replaced with some hack who decided that Glamour should look and read like it's trashy competitor, Cosmopolitan.Do we really need another, trashy, hyper-sex-focused magazine out there? Do we need another magazine that is overloaded with cheesy puns in the titles? (Why, why, WHY is that SO prevalent in women's magazines? Does anyone realize how dumb it is?)Save your money and don't bother with this COsmo rehash."
1,Disappointed,"I subscribed to Glamour for several years, and I agree wholeheartedly with the review by Kelly Oliver. The magazine's current focus on sex as well as the editor's apparent obsession with celebrities led me to cancel my subscription this year. Britney Spears on the cover was the finbal straw - if I wanted Teen magazine I would subscribe to it!"
5,Read this magazine for 33 years,I have been reading Glamour since i was 16 and still find the articles interesting and it helps me keep up with fashion and cosmetics still at my age. I like to try to keep current and Glamour helps me do that. Great magazine at all ages.
5,Well balanced magazine!,"I decided to subscribe to this magazine a couple of years and have not been dissappointed; it is well balanced since it has articles on every subject that a woman, wife, mother, daughter is interested in. Used to read Cosmo but I hate its sex obsessed magazines. Keep up the good work Glamour!!!"
1,I tried to cancel but they wouldn't let me,I am very displeased with this. I tried to cancel my subscription but they would not do so. I do not want this magazine.
4,Always a Good Read,"This is the best woman's magazine out there: a combination of fashion, current events, Philanthropist's causes and yummy recipes."
4,Glamour,"Good magazine, plenty of interesting stuff, up to date info, fashions, fashion tips, health and beauty.Would recommend."
3,Good but not great,"It's a good magazine, but nothing spectacular about it. But then I just read a single issue of the magazine from my subscription."
2,"Cosmo is not what it used to be, but this magazine is the worst one",This magazine is as terrible as a magazine can get. Cosmopolitan isn't what it used to be but this magazine (Glamour) is garbage. Thank god I got the subscription for only $7 because other wise I'd call to have it canceled and demand for my money to be returned. This magazine has nothing interesting or new to read about...
3,meah,Thought this magazine would be similar to Cosmo but unfortunately I was wrong. It seems kind of boring to me.
3,Not loving it,"This is the first magazine i have bought in all my life and I am not a teenager at all, I think it's kind of good, but not good enough. I have seen In style, and I like much better, but i bought this for less than the half of the price of In Style... I didn't know what to expect."
2,Missed the mark,I am a stitch directory addict and I own quite a few. I purchased this on a whim without much research. This directory was disappointing in that it is primarily a motif directory with very few stitches. This book is small and the charts are difficult to read. The motifs were not exciting nor presented in a consistent manner. I think the author tried to cover too many things in such a small book and thus it is skimpy on fair isle and some of the motif categories.The how to knit section is pretty good but I don't need that information and other books that present the same information have better illustrations/pictures.I plan to donate the copy I purchased to our local library - perhaps it will be useful to someone else.
2,superficial book,"I am new in this area but still the book looks very shallow in its explanation of each topic covered. Some materials are not necessary such as how electricity works. I felt that these materials and the gigantic fonts are to fill the pages. The whole ""book"" if we can call it a book can be condensed to maybe less than 50 pages.The good thing about the book is that it does explain some basic concepts of energy market to someone without any kind of background knowledge but don't expect to get anything more out of it. I can't seem to find these concepts elsewhere and maybe this could be the reason to buy the book."
4,Good Beginers Guide,"This has served as a good reference book for me when i start looking into a new area of a utility. It is very high-level and general, but that is what most people need to begin with before moving into the deeper books out there."
4,Excellent introduction to the Electricity Industry,The Electricity industry is an extremely complex and detailed environment. This book has proven to be an extremely valuable tool to provide new employess with some background and insight into their new positions. I recommend it to anyone in the industry that is looking for a high-level overview or introduction to the bigger picture.
1,Understanding Today's Electricity Business,"I don't recommend this book to engineers. It seemed rather superficial. The first half of the book dealt with basic electricity, which could have been covered in a single short chapter or thrown into the Appendix. The remainder of the book did not delve into the subject matter of the electricity business in any great detail. I felt unfulfilled after reading the book."
2,Quality has gone down dramatically,"I used to be a subscriber and an avid reader. Recently, perhaps in the last two years or so, the quality of the writing has become rather poor. The selection of articles is uninteresting, and sometimes half the articles themselves are so poorly written as to be unreadable. The fiction is simply mediocre, and the entire magazine seems to be infected with editor Lewis Lapham's shrill and ever-growing Notebook (does the man ever have anything interesting or original to say?). In short, Harper's is not the magazine it once was. I would suggest the Atlantic Monthly if you want a magazine that is interesting, informative, and well-written, cover to cover."
3,Variable quality,"The topics are usually interesting and the articles are often though provoking. Unfortuantely, the quality of the writing is erratic. While one article might be excellent, another will sort of fade out half way through. Someone needs to seriously tighten down on the editing."
1,magazine in decline,"I dont enjoy this publication at all anymore, dont know if editorial leadership has changed"
1,Kitty Litter Pan Liner...,"... and that's only if you hate the cat. The tired, saggy voice of tired, saggy northeastern liberalism that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY to anyone who's not part of tired, saggy, New York literary-lit-crit circles (or people with pretensions or desire of belonging thereto). Whatever Harper's once was, it isn't any more -- it's just sad, sorry garbage, The New Yorker without the cartoons. Read The New Criterion instead."
2,bias in advertising,"Don't read this magazine if you are expecting unbiased reporting and truly independent viewpoints.For example, Philip Morris Inc. is the top advertiser in Harper's. Not once in the last ten years has there been an in-depth feature critical of the tobacco industry. Anti-smoking ads have even been withheld from the magazine in order to allow for ""competeitve separation"" from tobacco advertisements.Can you, then, resonably expect honest reporting from these guys?"
2,The Sky is Falling,"I used to read Harper's when I was a cynical 20-something. Now that I'm a somewhat less cynical 30-something, I just can't take the nearly hysterical atmosphere of gloom that pervades it. Life is grim for many around the world--always has been, always will. Wallowing in that grimness isn't in anyone's interest. Additionally, Harper's doesn't give voice to alternative political viewpoints--if they had their way, the editors would pack the courts, congress, and White House with liberals no matter the cost. This is a pluralist society and a magazine with the intellectual firepower of Harper's at its disposal should be strong enough to admit a range of views. Let the Harper's politburo have their funereal fun and read The New Yorker instead."
1,Where is it??,"So I ordered the magazine in Nov. 6, 2005. Its now Feb. 22nd, 2006 and the magazines (since I also ordered the Smithsonian and Scientific American) are nowhere to be seen. Of course, my account was quickly charged and at this pace, I'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before I receive any of them... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine, it might be a better idea to get somewhere else..."
1,Thoughtful Must Mean Boring,"Harper's reminds me of a book reading I once went to. The author read a selection from Proust. It took forever and when she finally got to the 'point' the crowd all murmured and nodded in approval at its profundity. I thought I was going to go out of my mind.......what's so profound about taking 1000 words to make a point that could have been made in ten words or less? And therein lies my problem with Harper's.People here compare it with other ""thoughtful"" magazines like the Atlantic and the New Yorker. No....it's not like those magazines at all; every paragraph in those magazines is packed with information that is critical to understanding the entire story. They don't take the rambling ""blue highways"" approach like Harper's does. If you really want a magazine that is balanced and in depth without the wandering prose of Harper's try my two favorites: the New Yorker and the Economist. I also recommend the Atlantic."
3,No signs of a subscription!,"On January 19th, I ordered this subscription as a gift for my niece. It is exactly a month later, and she has received no notification that she is going to receive the magazine. I was aware that the magazine would not arrive for several weeks, but in years past, notification has been sent out by magazines to inform recipients of the upcoming subscription. I give Harper's the benefit of the doubt when I give 3 stars... since I have yet to see any sign of a subscription."
3,spotty but interesting,"Harper's seems to go back and forth between featuring articles with fairly decent critical thought, and shock-value wackiness (their famous Index is a great example). I subscribed to this for two years, let it lapse, and think about resubscribing occasionally. Works as a fun suppliment to other magazines (Atlantic, New Yorker)."
5,The best!,"Whenever I feel that this country has gone beserk, I read Harper's and especially Lewis Lapham's editorials, and realize that sanity still exists. He always seems to hit the mark squarely and it is a shame that we don't hear and see more of him."
2,Variable,"During the 1980s and 90s Harpers decayed badly from a journal of literature and opinion into a collection of short pieces and meaningless charts- sort of a journal for the literary pretentious with a short attention span. During the late 90s and the early part of this century, an effort was made to recreate the old Harpers.Gone now are the annoying fragments and pointless tables, but the quality of the writing is still variable. At its best, Harpers still trails far behind The Atlantic, and at its worst it's pitifully sophmoric. I'll try it again in a few more years."
5,what's not to like?!?,"Here's a quick breakdown:1. Harpers will feed your need for the trivial. The Index is a fascinating collection of facts and figures, and the front-of-book section is probably one of the most quirky, laugh-out-loud funny and stimulating in the business.2. Great fiction. Some up-and-comers submit, along with some old pros (a recent story by Joyce Carol Oates was outstanding)3. Great features. Some great topics, albeit a lot of environmental stuff, it's still well-rounded and well-informed. Great ones I've read recently include a look at maids, SUVs, education reform and more.I can see why people might not like this magazine because it appears to be ""uppity."" In fact, the only thing that annoys me about this magazine is the letters to the editor, where all of the Ivy-league intellectuals write in and try to prove how smart they are. But I think the appeal is more widespread than that. And you'll be paying less than a dollar an issue -- you'll definitely get your money's worth."
5,"Honest, independent magazine","This is one of my favorite magazines. If you want to understand what is going on in the country and the world, you should read Harper's every month. Gutsy, fearless reporting. If you are looking for more than corporate- speak reporting and analysis in a magazine, you should subscribe to Harper's."
1,terrible bags for anyone that is actually working,"The bags hang high on the belt, the big tape holder gets in the way of slipping your tools back into the tool holders, so you end up with a jumbled mess of tools in the bag and it's hard to find them because the bags are high on the hip. There are better options, these bags make my work slower. you want to be able to pick things out and put them back by feel, not having to look, hard to do with these bags. McRose is way to go."
4,POURCEL PORTRAIT,"I DISCOVERED FRANCK POURCEL'S MUSIC IN THE EARLY 60'S WITH AN ALBUM TITLED ""POURCEL PORTRAITS"" ON CAPITOL. I APPRECIATED THE UNIQUE ARRANGEMENTS,A NICE BLEND OF STRINGS,PERCUSSION AND BRASS. THIS WAS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER PERCY FAITH. THIS ALBUM DOESN'T DISAPPOINT EITHER, WITH A VERY DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENT OF""I LOVE PARIS"", C'EST MAGNIFIQUE AND THE BEAUTIFUL ""LA VIE EN ROSE. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
4,great!,"great taste, lower on calories than alot of other bars that have this much protein and low supgar is another huge bonus!"
3,Heads up,"Just a heads up, this is not a normal sized socket lamp. If you were, say, trying to buy a LED color changing light bulb with this to make a sick room light, it won't work."
4,WORTH THE WAIT,"This game did not disappoint. The graphics were amazing, and the storyline picked up where the first had left off so you got to follow along as Hans continues on to Syberia. This game was more enjoyable the first. The only downside - when the game is over, it happens very abruptly. One minute you're playing, the next reading credits. This was highly disappointing, but until that point everything was just as I had hoped. While the ending leaves you wanting more, the game is worth every penny. I could not stop, every change I had, I was continuing on with an imaginative journey that kept me wanting to push farther and farther."
3,Good puzzle game,This game picks up where the first Syberia game left off. The plot continues as you follow Kate. More puzzles and an excellent plot. Stunning graphics and gameplay.
5,"Works, very convenient",I have a USB charger that plugs into the wall and this works just fine. Tested on my notebook USB and also works.
3,Cable is too short,"Works fine, but cable is VERY short for a cable designed to charge a handheld video game. My kids like charging while they play, but these cables are a little short of 4' and they will not work well in a car which is what I purchased them for. I guess if I had bothered blowing up the fine print on the ad and then converting from metric to english units, I may have been able to figure out how short they were before purchasing them."
4,"Not quite brilliant, but a lot of fun nonetheless.","I recently read McHugh's book in preparation for another trip back to Ireland. Although the author is a bit younger than me and seems to aim this book at a slighter younger audience (the 20s and 30s age group), I still found it to be especially enjoyable. Although the book flags a little towards the end--or perhaps it was author's journey that was flagging--McHugh possesses a very engaging writing style and has a wonderful wit that had me laughing with him most of the way.If you have already been to Ireland and would just like to reminisce, McHugh's book will take you back to a lot of scenarios where you will probably find yourself going, ""I remember that."" ""Pint-Sized Ireland"" is also a quick, fun read for anyone who enjoys travel essays."
3,Details,"This is a compilation of visions of different Catholic Mystics.It is a bargain. However, I am not sure what is the official standof the Roman Catholic Church on these literatures. A keen observerwould immediately notice some discrepancies. For example, Saint Brigidmentioned that the Virgin Mary died in Jerusalem but this was not sharedby Blessed Anne Emmerich who attested Mary spent her last days in Ephesus.Nevertheless, this book is still very interesting."
5,The Life of Mary As Seen by the Mystics,"As a mother of a young child, I rarely have time to read, but this book was worth the time (and late nights!). It starts with a great summary of each mystic and how their visions were evaluated by the Church and how the author integrated them into this elegant narrative of Mary's life. The ""inside look"" at Mary's life and that of St. Joseph were thought provoking and inspiring; especially in understanding Mary's life of deep prayer and contemplation. A wonderful and easy read, especially with Advent coming!"
5,a voice that embraces my soul with warmth.,I grew up on this album. It is something that you'll never grow out of or get bored with. Roger's music has a gentleness and warmth that envelopes me everytime I listen to it.
1,I returned it,I returned this item. I was looking for something that had a little humor and was 'light' reading - eventhough it would have alot of information. This book was like a technical and complex college textbook... not at all what I had hoped.
3,Heavy reading,"Of course you'll understand many things about Jewish traditions and customs but the book is not written for laymen.Some answers are oxymoron to other questions, maybe if one delve more in the subject it could be explained but that explanation is not in this book.The book doesn't invite you to sit several hours at a time to read it. You'll have to take brakes every few questions.Some questions aren't utterly answered, so you'll be worst with this theme at the book's end."
3,NOT THE ESSENTIAL,"THE SOUND QUALITY IS POOR AND JOHN IS PLAYING AN ELECTRIC GUITAR DURING THE LIVE PERFORMANCES. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE DVD IS WHEN HE IS SITTING IN HIS OLD BACKYARD IN MAYWOOD ILLINOIS SINGING AND TALKING ABOUT HIS OLD HOMETOWN AND HOW HE GOT THE IDEAS FOR SOME OF HIS SONGS. HE TAKES YOU ON A TOUR OF MAYWOOD IN AN OLD CAR. I CAN DIG THIS PART BUT THE LIVE TRACKS PRETTY WELL SUCK. I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN JOHN AROUND 7 TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. PRINE IS AT HIS BEST WHEN HE IS ONSTAGE BY HIMSELF, ACCOUSTIC GUITAR BEING HIS ONLY INSTRUMENT. THE LOUD BAND FORMAT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. HE ALSO LOOKED LIKE HE WAS COPPING QUITE A BUZZ ALSO. BUY IT FOR THE DOCUMENTARY, BUT NOT FOR THE LIVE SET."
4,FINALLY!!,"I saw this soundstage show when it first aired in 1980 and loved it. His backup band with John Burns is fantastic. My only disappointment with this dvd is that the sound quality is good but not great, so it might not get played as much as I'd like. i recognize that it's 27 years old, but as a comparison, Neil Young's Live at Massey Hall is 36 years old and that sound quality is fantastic. Go figure. Still a thumbs up and all true Prine fans should have it in their library."
3,A great performance lost,"There are glimpses of the possibility of a great video of a great artist, but to my regret, most of it is lost in a very poor sound mix. There is only one other DVD of a Prine performance that I am aware of, so I purchased this with great expectations. Perhaps someone will ""find"" the sound and reissue this."
3,You can't have poor sound quality with John Prine!!,"John Prine is a storyteller!! But if the sound is not clear, you miss too much. Other that poor sound quality, John Prine takes the viewer on a tour of his hometown in Maywood, Illinois. He drives around and points out the incidents in his life that prompted his lyrics. The concert stage performances are good.A guest star Billy Lee Riley joins him onstage and doing an old hit, Red Hot. And there is a lot of music here, picture is clear, and I will reiterate.....without good sound, you do John Prine no justice!!Try this great performance as Iris Dement joins John Prine.John Prine - Live from Sessions at West 54thRizzo."
1,"Cheaply made,non-weighted,plastic chess pieces.","I thought these chess pieces were going to be triple weighted,high quality House of Staunton chess pieces but instead they are a cheap imitation set made in China! Not deserving of the Staunton name at all."
4,This is the 1st edition,"With the international edition sometimes it isn't clear which american edition it is, this is the 1st edition, and is missing A TON of stuff that is in later editions."
2,Biomedical Engineering Student,"...I was not impressed with the content of this book because of mistakes made in the data it reported ie. that polymers can't form crystalline structures. I also found that the equations presented in the text did not have detailed information and at times the explaination of how to use the equations were slight.I was also disappointed in the fact that I had to buy a xerox copy from the book store on campus (my financal aid would not pay for a book purchased anywhere else) because the publisher stopped print production before the class started which left myself and several other students ""hanging"" with only the option of purchasing a cheap copy for nearly the price of the original. Now I am left with an expensive book that I can't even you as reference material for future courses nor can I sell it because it is a copy and lastly because it is no longer in print."
5,So happy and enjoyable..,"This little book, I found at a thrift store. I was fond of the orange cover and the tininess of the little book, not to mention the appealing German title, but I did not expect myself to read the book and enjoy it. I hadn't even realized it was a collection of short poems, translated by Mark Twain. The poems are delightful and so fun to read. I take this book everywhere with me and I'm glad I found it."
3,THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS,what a fabulous invention....my son has been using it since he was a couple of months to date (age 22 months now)....it is an expensive product cuz they are so many out there for a cheaper price but this will pay for itself....
1,It sucks,"This cd is for those who are into old school. I love old school, but 'Quality' old-school, the songs all sounded the same and the music videos all look like home videos. Not the cd for you if you're used to professional videography like on MTV. Even if it was 3 stars, that's not worth the price on its cover."
3,Caveat Emptor,"Since there are no track listings, and since the album cover states ""2 Double Play Compact Disc"", ""Equivalent to 2 Albums"", I'd like to alert you that there is only one CD (in case you thought otherwise like I did... which would make this a remarkable bargain!) and there are only 16 tracks (NOT 2 albums) on the disc, good though they may be. If you are a Shearing fan like I am, you most likely have the tracks already: 1. Have you met Miss Jones 2. Laura, 3. I Could write a book, 4 I'll take romance, 5. No moon at all, 6; Stardust, 7. I love you, 8, Early autumn, 9. My romance, 10. How long has this been going on, 11. Autumn Leaves, 12 There's a small hotel, 13. Moonlight becomes you, 14 Nina never knew, 15 Midnight sun, 16. September song. All good stuff, but don't believe the CD cover. The price IS right."
3,Poor girl's Mark Murphy,"Mark Murphy and Catherine Dupuis share a number of traits: attractive and strong voice, wide and erratic vibrato, odd phrasing, scat singing, and good taste in sidemen and material. Murphy is a mixed bag for me and Murphy is superior to Dupuis in control of vibrato, pitch, scatting, swinging and evocative interpretation of lyrics. Dupuis has potential and I enjoyed some of this CD, but one listen may be enough."
1,Classic Books America Edition is Riddled With Errors!,"I bought the Classic Books America paperback entitled The Basic Writings of John Stuart Mill, my intent being to read The Subjection of Women, one of the three works by Mill included here. The first two pages had three sentences that were either missing words or otherwise garbled. there are many editions of Mill available - don't buy this one!"
1,"Great book, extremely poor editing job","I personally love JS Mill and wanted a copy of these essays to catch up on some of his works that I am not as familiar with. The issue is not his writing or the book itself, it is the editing. There are a dozen misspellings, missing words, run-ons, and other anomalies that are not from JS Mill. It honestly looks like someone translated it into Chinese and then had someone retranslate the book back to English with minimal Chinese understanding. Don't buy this copy: find one for a couple bucks more and purchase that one."
1,what does this say?,"I've meant to write this for awhile. Someone sent me a subscription to this magazine as some kind of bizarre cruel "" joke.""If you knew me you would know it is not my thing and after the first seeing and the horror over the rifles et al I imagine you got your money's worth. It got turned over to an investigation that as far as I can tell still isn't figuring out who ordered it. What a lousy thing to experience.I gave them away to a friend because altho we are very different I know he does enjoy the content and because he is a friend it makes his day. He gave me a bunch of home grown roses in return. Given the severe flu it was a nice way to segue into this review. There is nothing in the magazine I ""get"" but plenty about an act of kindness I enjoy."
3,"Should just be Field, there isn't much stream",I got this magazine because I'm an avid fisherman. I've been pretty disappointed over the last year with the unbalanced hunting to fishing ration.I doubt I will renew this subscription.
5,Interesting and usefull reading,I've been reading F&S for a couple of years now. This publication provides quite a bit of useful info on hunting and fishing practices. Well illustrated and offers some interesting diagrams to help learning a new trick or two. For $5 / year it's hard to beat.
1,Haven't Received it Yet !!,I have NOT RECEIVED any copies of this magazine from the publisher as of today's date (01-17-2013). It seems to take a while to get the subscription process rolling.
3,Problems with payment,"I ordered this magazine thru you on 12/2/09 with a credit card-Visa, which cleared on 12/9/09.I have now recieved 3 unpaid notices from Field and Stream saying that the account is unpaid. They now are stopping the gift issues for being unpaid.!!I have sent them-TWICE copies of the e-mail I recieved from you stating that the subscription was confirmed and paid. I have also sent them copies of my credit card statment showing the payment to you for their magazine--TWICE.I e-mailed them today hoping to get this strightened out. Can you help??"
1,I have not recieved any issues as of this date 12/29/12,"I can not answer untill I start reciving an IssueI am still waiting on my first issue, it is hard to judge untill I get my first Issue"
3,Field and Stream,I AM IRRITATED THAT IT WAS ORDERED IN AUGUST...AND TODAY IT CAME AUGUST AND SEPT ISSUES AND THE MAGAZINE HAS A EXPIRATION DATE OF JULY 2012.WHATS WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE? THEY SENT OLD MAGAZINES AND ARE TAKING AWAY 2 MOS OF CURRENT EVENTS IN ONE SWOOP.I EXPECT A EXPIRE DATE TO BE NO SOONER THEN SEPTEMBER 2012. AND I EXPECT CREDIT FOR OLD MAGAZINES!!! PLEASE PASS THIS ON!!
1,Only if your a republican,"This magazine is a total disappointment - I love hunting and fishing, but believe in gun control- this publication is for those who have two guns under their pillow and an arsenal in the basement. Why not stick to reviews and hunting fishing articles not telling me how to vote! I loved this magazine 10 years ago , now I wouldn't wipe with it."
2,"Yuppified by the minute, yet stupider by the second","You would think that as the history of Field and Stream progresses and the editors and writers become high class city folk they would at least go to a college and learn to write intellegently. This magazine is full of nothing but opinions (not that i disagree with them, i just wished they sounded smart when voicing their thoughts). These writers have no background in wildlife management, yet give advice like they do. And if they do have a management background, I am glad i'm not getting my Wildlife Resource degree there. Field and Stream has became another tool of arguement. Readers yelling at writters and writters responding with cussing (no joke). The only joke here is field and Stream. Teaches nothing. Says nothing. Costs a lot."
2,Can't rate the product - over a month and no show,Magazine was ordered over a month ago and have yet to see the first copy. Certainly taking a long time to get here. So this review is about the subscription not the magazine which I'm sure will be everything I expected - sometime?
3,It is a magazine,We ordered it for our son and haven't received the first copy yet but we should see it in the next few weeks. It was easy without complications.
4,Good reading for the outdoorsman (person),If your looking for a degree in Wildlife management go to college and spend a bunch of money! If your looking for interesting reading material I would say this is my favorite outdoor magazine. By the way I am a student in Wildlife managemet and 99% of the time what they say is true. And the way they write it makes it so much nicer to read than text book!
5,Fabulous mag. for nature lovers!,"If you are a hunter or a nature lover, the pictures in this magazine are well worth every penny. I really enjoy reading the articles and finding out about new products on the horizon. Whether its deer or fish, they always have some information I can use."
2,Very Thin & Lacking In Content!,"I ordered this for my 19 year old son who is a wildlife & fishing enthusiast. It is not what we expected. The articles are varied, short, and never in depth. Most of the magazine is advertising, with much of it being sexually or romanticly inclined.The magazine itself is so thin like one of the weekly tabloid newspapers. As for the articles, they only touch on a subject, and usually one that even a 12 year old has already been educated about. We expected more from this.The onl thing you learn from this is that you wasted your money and have collelcted some more paper you'll have to recycle."
2,This ain't your grandfather's Field & Stream,"It's gotten a bit political. A lot of really silly, contrived polls and articles and not as many field stories. The field tests are decent and when they do actual field stories, you get the feel of what the magazine is supposed to be. Cut the fuzzy bunny environmentalism and stick to what you're good at."
3,Not fitting for the Duke,"Yikes...The Train Robbers was among the last 10 or 15 films with John Wayne. He should have skipped this one. It's not his best effort. Mediocre plot, writing, acting, directing, etc. Guy meets girl. Girl wants to clear her name. Tons of money involved. Millions of bad guys who say nothing throughout the film chase good guys. A bit of a twist at the end. Ricardo Montalban has a small part but delivers the best line of the entire film. You'll have to wait til the end of the movie to see it. Eh, it's an okay movie and if you stay awake and pay attention to the plot there are times where nothing makes sense. How'd they know that? Well, perhaps those scenes were cut in the final edit??? IMDB rates this 6.1 out of 10 based upon over 1000 reviews. I'd agree with that. Maybe that's why Amazon has this one free for Prime Members?"
2,Wayne light!,"One of the later Wayne westerns is pretty thin on action and excitement.It's from the time where they more or less stopped making westerns - until the revival with Kasdan's ""Silverado"". This one is really clinging to a straw."
2,One of the worst of Wayne's,"Although it is great to see Wayne seeing him is about the best in this film. I did not really care about these people riding left and right. It has to be something about the story, because the actors are a great bunch of people. I expect Wayne always to be real hero, but here it is not so. Take any other Wayne, even those of the 30's rather than this one."
2,A Dull Ride for the Duke,"Director Burt Kennedy fails to deliver the goods in this drawn-out Western adventure - unredeemed by the star power of John Wayne, Ann-Margret and Rod Taylor. There's endless riding, but precious little action or plot development. Along with ""Cahill U.S. Marshal"" (1973), the weakest of the Duke's latter-day vehicles."
4,the train robbers,"l think it was too short but it was good,yes l enjoyed,especialy ann margrate thanks andreollithe train robbers and my friend john wayne"
5,Great !!!!!!!,This is not only a great John Wayne movie but also a great Rod Taylor movie for all of you Rod fans. You will not regret getting this & living through the action.
5,Best Book In the Industry on This Topic!,"Without a doubt, this is the best book in the industry on bioremediation engineering. It is well-written and has plenty of examples to impress the most technically astute environmental engineer or a student that is just starting to explore this topic. Dr. Cookson has developed a book that is relevant to design engineers, project managers and anyone involved in a bioremediation project. BRAVO!!"
5,Amazing,I have been a fan of Bobaflex for years. They were a local band here in the dubba V (WV) and rocked Huntington like no other local band has done before. The stuff they are doing on apologize for nothing is exactly what i expected and it was great to see turn the heat up on that cd it being one of the oldest songs that i remember from them. I am proud that they are the searing and screaming voice for West Virginia proving were not all toothless shoeless rednecks for more WV rock (which is the best underground scene in the world in my opinion Ive been all over and nothin is quite like here)check out Byzantine also a new label band signed on I believe the same label as lamb of God but don't quote me though they don't pack the same thunder as Bobaflex. Apologize for nothing GREAT ALBUM CHECK IT OUT!
5,"I like the album, and didn't see problems with where I bought it.","It's a good album, and it got here quick. A new album, not notched in the case or opened or used. And it worked good, shipping was quick, and they didn't charge anything extra, other than the original quoted shipping. I'd order from there again."
2,kinda stupid actually...,"well this band sounds like soil crossed with system of a down. i will give them that. heres the thing....I HATE SOIL! their whole gimmick is being stupid it seems. if you like altrenative metal then go ahead and buy it. if youre into metal, this most likely isn't for you."
2,Pass the cheese...,Cheesy is the only way I can describe this band. The music is tight and they play well together but that's the only compliment I can give them. I just saw them last night on the Master's of Horror tour and watching their singer simulate masturbating and shooting himself in the head with the mic just didn't do it for me.
1,Nothing special here!!,"I can't believe the hype about this band, there's nothing about music here, no guitar solos, no memorable guitar riffs(almost generic) and no complex musicianship!!! I bought this the last week, and now i throw it to the garbage, because i was bored as hell. So stay away of this and try something like: Scar Symmetry, Cerebral Effusion, Aborted and the likes."
3,iron man for kids,"these iron man movie was pretty good you have to keep switching to english audio and turning off the subtitles, because this dvd thinks that if iron man is in japan, so are you!"
5,Marvel Anime: Iron Man - Complete Series,Whole series on two DVDs. Media is solid as is package. Excellent video and audio quality. Worth the money for the series.
3,It's alright.,"I'm gonna make this short. It seems that these Marvel animes are following a formula. The Protagonist goes to Japan, something happens (It's not Godzilla this time), choppy dialog in between, lots and lots of lazy animation when talking, some cool battle sequences, 12 episodes later...it's over. This isn't a bad anime, but my advice...save your money. Get it from the library, but hey..if you're an anime lover and you don't care about a good story...this is for you. I will say this about it..the coloring is fantastic, the character models are really cool and the animation is awesome! (With the exception of the close up on the face/ talking animation. So in short, it's ok."
1,Oh so BLAND - these croutons add Nothing to a Salad beyond a Crunch.,"These croutons are very bland, almost tasteless. I can't tell you how much I regret my purchase.Lets hope the birds find these crotons more palatable than I did.To be as fair as possible - these croutons:1.) vary in size between quite small (which predominates) and slightly larger. They average about a 1/4"" square2.) show no evidence of being toasted3.) have only vague and very mild hints of any flavor yet I can detect no ""off tastes"" either4.) This is essentially a white tasteless croton.Crotons can add an important flavor note to any salad. These croutons add nothing to a salad beyond a crunch.AVOID - Not Recommended"
2,"Nice Story, but Not Matching Known Biblical Details","I have been trying to learn more of the Biblical character Rahab so I purchased this novel. Although it had some interesting historical detail, it did not use the known details of Rahab's life given in the Biblical account so I was disappointed.It is not a bad read...but not a Biblically based novel. The cover art is beautiful."
1,Defective,"This hard drive was defective when i received it. I am currently waiting on a replacement or refund. I returned the drive on 09/20/2011, and have had no communication regarding the drive as of 10/04/2011."
2,DOWNHILL,"SLADE is already downhil in this album, recorded in 1983. The hit ""MY OH MY"" is a shame, so cheesy it is. They tried to write an anthem. Anyway, Holder, Lea, Hill and Powell still can deliver some good old rockin, and the CD is not totally bad."
5,A Bartender's must read,"This is a fun book well worth the price. If you bartend, your first couple of tips will pay for it.I learned a few new tricks and enjoyed seeing the ones that served me well during those 'slow nights'.Of the few books I've seen on the subject, this has the best collection of them. I am in Sales now and guess what, these tricks are still fun!"
2,"Should be called ""How to look stupid""","Do the stunts in this book and you're going to look thicker than a pound cake. The tricks don't ease awkward moments as it claims, instead it makes you feel more awkward than you did to begin with.I told my friends I'd levitate an olive for them and they all gathered around the bar. After 5 mins of trying to get the trick to work, it's still obvious to those watching that the olive isn't floating at all. Suddenly you become the butt of all jokes and your friends start calling you names like ""spaz"".I gave it two stars because there is one trick that is actually really good and is almost worth the price of the book. It's the one where you make a spectators finger ring link onto the stem of a borrowed bar wine glass."
2,I might use a total of two tricks...,"I hate leaving bad reviews of things because I know someone is trying to make money and I don't want to hinder that.Truth is that the concept of this book was exactly what I was looking for, but it didn't have anything special in it. I might use a total of two tricks. Most of the things just come off as stupid or little clever games (i.e. with matches)... but very little magic or tricks."
5,A crowd pleaser,"To keep this short and simple, I can simply say that the book was worth the small amount of money that I spent on it. The tricks are very well explained. Tricks from the book range from stupid/funny tricks to aparent magic. Physics plays a big part in alot of these tricks. I got a kick out of it. There are tricks that I love more than others of course, but all of the tricks are cute/funny if not amazing. I bartend, and I must admit that Bar Tricks are not very practical when I'm busy working, but they are fun when I bar-hop."
3,"Crowd pleasing, but nothing to wet yourself over","Haven't put this book to too much use as of yet, but i can tell ou that i find it a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong, they're cool tricks and will probably come in very helpful, but the tricks lack the mystifying appeal i was hoping for. FOr the most part, they're all cool tricks, but once you preform them for friends, you're giving away how it's done. I was anting soemthing that would leave my friends a little more mystified. I guess the tricks just lack the magical side i was looking for. Still impressive tricks, but they won't leave people in aww, unless they're really hammered i guess. I'd suggest combinign this book with The Complete Book of Beer CDrinking Games jsut for kicks. hope this was helpful for you. peace"
4,Bar Magic,Knew most of them already but it's a great compilation. I recommend this to anyone looking to learn some very devious bar beta and tricks.
4,LOVE this Planner,"This is by far the BEST planner you will ever buy! I've had mine and become so unbelievably attached to it its just plain sad... If it was not so special to me I swear I would throw it out of my car window though... I've been desperately searching for refills and would be willing to spend top dollar to get them IF I COULD EVER FIND ANY... the expense, password and website pages are fantastic but it will be absolutely useless in about a month when the monthly pages run out... if anyone knows where to get refills please let me know."
1,Strategically broken: avoid,"In this game, you play your word. Your opponent plays their word, and then removes your word. You then play your word in relation to their word. It's a simple and amusing way to play the game.The problem is that the double and triple word score tiles thus get reexposed after every usage... with the person that had previously used them getting to use them again and again and again. The only realistic way to avoid giving your opponent the triple word score repeatedly is to forfeit your turn.As it stands, the game is broken (as is also discussed in the reviews for Scrabble Express). I love Scrabble, but I am baffled as to how this made it through any kind of substantive gameplay testing.Either make up house rules or don't bother with this one."
3,a wonderful african fusion album,"the latest installment in the travel series from six degrees, we find ourselves with mali records' issa bagayogo. this particular release is a fusion of soft electro and african chanting/singing/speaking, but without the synth lines of prior african fusion acts. what intrigues me the most is the method in which both the vocals and the instruments fuse and blend so wonderfully. this album contains great tracks inspired by all manner of electronic music, including hip-hop, drum'n'bass, breaks, and house - but done softly so as not to make the vocals a mere sample in the song. while this album is produced quite well, it is nothing that grabs you, sits you down, and forces you to listen. on the contrary, it is nice for background music and music for the car on an afternoon drive to a nearby city."
1,Was the best flagship magazine,"Now its about compromise ,sadly it's poorly designed and nostalgic where as once it was beautiful and foward thinking with mr. Baron at the helm ....bring him back ,an you will have a magazine worth looking at"
3,maybe worth it if it's cheap,"I got the magazine pretty quickly, so that was good. There really aren't many substantive articles...it seems to be more about pictures. I guess it focuses on ""high"" fashion...it's mostly odd stuff that I would never wear. When I get dressed in the morning, I want to look pretty....most of the people in this magazine don't really look very attractive. Anyway, if you like high fashion, you might like this. I got the year's subscription for $5 and I occasionally find pictures that are interesting, so I'm not displeased with my purchase. But if it was full priced, it would not be worth it for me."
5,Can't go wrong,I love love love this magazine! You can never go wrong with Harper's Bazaar. I'm working full time and going to school full time so I'm not able to devote as much time as I would like to reading my chick stuff but it's there when I do have a few minutes :) I've been subscribed for years now and don't intend to stop.
2,Harpers Bazaar magazine.,"never anyting in it I am interested in Certainly nothing suits our lifestyle, don't know hat more to say, bad choice."
1,I'm not cancelling because it only cost $5--but it's rubbish,"I've subscribed to fashion magazines for a long, long time, and try to switch them up. I hadn't gotten Bazaar in a year or so, and what an unpleasant surprise. The editorial shoots are simply horrible. It's not just the styling. The photography is even worse. I will give this one a long rest after the year. Maybe that's why it was such a great deal."
5,Fabulous Magazine!,I have been reading Harpers for about a year now and I love it.It has everything from current trends in fashion to politics.I love the celebrities they use for the covers and the photography is wonderful.It is one of several magazines I get every month that I read from cover to cover without putting it down.It rates as one of my top 5 favorites.If you like fashion then you can't go wrong with Harpers Bazaar and the price of a subscription can't be beat for this type of magazine!
2,Give me back my old Bazaar...,"I started reading HB 6 years ago, when the incredible Liz Tilberis was editor. Back then my eyes lit up everytime I opened an issue; the layouts and photography were awesome - way better than it is now. These days the beauty and fashion images are mostly dull and tedious. Some of them are really 60's, and not in the good way. I think it has a lot to do with who's in charge. They need to bring in somebody who will actually make the contents of the magazine attractive to the reader. Anyway, like another reviewer, I just buy it for the ads."
1,ADULT PICTURE BOOK,"For anyone who has read my review on Elle, I feel the same way about this magazine. Few articles, full of ads. If you enjoy looking at fashion photography and fashion ads, then this is a good magazine for you. (Although, I feel like this is a weaker version of Elle.) For the rest of us, skip it and purchase a better magazine. I canceled my subscription."
2,There are better magazines...,"I have subscriptions to several magazines and bought this subscription when Amazon had it on sale for $5. And I'm not too impressed with this. It may work for a teenager, ""may"" being the key word. It has more ads than content, and I would be flipping through trying to get some reading material. Not happy at all and did not renew my subscription. The only use I got out of it is that my toddler likes the bright pictures. Marie Claire is slightly better and that's my current subscription."
1,Yet to receive...,"I'd be happy to write a detailed review of this product, if I had a product to review. I've still NEVER received an issue. I guess I will be contacting customer service."
1,Very Disappointing,I purchased this magazine in July and was told that I would receive it in October and that Amazon had no control over this. Then why are you selling it???
1,Received only one issue,"I ordered this magazine and one other in September. I received one issue of this one pretty quick, and then nothing . . . I called in November and was told that issues would be shipping in January since that was their next ""cycle"" Okay, fine. I was irritated and felt that should have been communicated somehow when I purchased it. It said there might be a wait, but I would never have thought FIVE months. So, I waited until January. Nothing. I called towards the end of January, and was told it was in the mail. Well, its now March and I haven't seen either of the magazines ordered from this company. I also ordered a third, that I have seen issues of, so its obviously the seller I used. And, this is not an address mix up. Both times I called, I had them verify my address. They had to correct one. I should have listened to the other reviews. Beware. You might never see what you paid money for."
1,Out of touch with the 21st century,"Wow, what a great idea: let's make everything look and read like it's 1950 again! Sheesh, what were they thinking, honestly? If they were trying to be fashion-centric, it's already failed, as the speed of fashion moves so fast that Bazaar should be thinking AHEAD, not dredging up a long-moldy history. I can't wait until my sub runs out, hate to say. Give me Nylon or British Vogue any day- at least they remember what century they are in."
1,"I'm waiting 1,5 months already!","I will get my first issue two months after I purchased the magazine!If ever, that's like theres no use getting one."
1,Too many adds.,"I know that many magazines nowadays have tons of adds, but the amount of adds on this magazine is ridiculous.I thought I would find nice articles to read but I didn't, all I found was pictures of expensive products and comments on where to buy them.I didn't like this magazine at all. I should have gotten Marie Claire/Cosmopolitan."
1,boring mag,"I got a subscription to this magazine because I was looking for an upscale fashion mag. Ladies, please pass on this one. The articles are boring and somewhat out of touch. But, what really put me over the top, is when a few months ago I started noticing the cigarette ads in the magazine. I mean really, I know its a tough market out there, but I just find it completely unethical to have these ads in a magazine read by young women. Won't be renewing my subscription to this one!!"
2,NEVER RECEIVED,"Well, it appears that I ordered this subscription - I had forgotten about it, on April 16th, 2010. I have yet to receive it."
1,Unimpressed,I was first intimidated about the amount of pages in this magazine but after I opened it and realized it was mostly ads it all made sense. This would be ideal for photographers looking for inspiration or fashion addicts but neither of these are me.
2,fading fast,"This magazine used to be as good, and in certain ways better, than Vogue. But the most recent redesign under the new editor in chief is apalling! I was so disappointed in the issue with Meg Ryan on the cover (the fashion looked generic, all the stories were strange and boring). Vogue and W are clearly the best ones out there now."
2,too many ads,"95% of the magazine are ads!! I bought this subscription for $5 but still wasn't worth it, decided to cancel after first month."
3,Fun fashion mag,"Since I was offered a year subscription for only $4 I decided why not? I am a subscriber to a few fashion magazines and I think this one is pretty good. Many articles about fashion, beauty, celebs, but also non-fashion topics as well. The clothing is on the high-end side, but it gives you inspiration to create more wallet-friendly versions."
2,Could be better,"The fashion articles and spreads are beautiful, but it's mostly advertisements. I was hoping for more substance, more articles, something more solid. Skipping all the ads, I'm done reading it in under 20 minutes."
4,Best of the bunch!,Agree with most of the reviews. This is my fave for fashion. Hard hitting and getz to the point. Not too overly sexy?? If you know what I mean.
2,Good magazine but horrible customer service,"Harper's Bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine, but I wish now that I had never gotten a subscription. True, each issue would be more expensive, but1) I could pick out what issues seemed worth buying, as some are thin and empty2) They are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue. I have only gotten one issue on time, to be honest."
2,Not Fair,"Dear Sirs,Two days ago I ordered Harper's Bazar at your ""special"" price with a deadline of October 30th, and now you lower the price once the deadline is over!!! That is not ""playing fair"".."
3,Big Teeth,"This is kind of a nice necklace. The problem is that the quality of the pearls isn't the same as pictured (even when you spot the flaws). For instance, the one I purchased has several misshapened pearls. They looked like big, flat molars. I couldn't get over this and had to return this item."
1,For Bridesmaids,"I bought 6 necklaces as gifts for my bridesmaids to wear at my wedding. The picture was beautiful and the peridot would have gone well with the olive green dresses. When they arrived yesterday, I found the same problems several others had, such as: one had a missing stone and most pearls-did in fact look like molars (every strange). I did have one necklace that looked as pictured. So, if you take a chance you may get a good one, but 1 in 6 odds are not that great."
2,not what I thought it would look like,"The price I paid was great for what I hoped I was getting. When the necklace arrived the fresh water pearls were so ugly, they were much larger then the picture showed and they had pointed ends....very weird shaped. I have never worn the necklace, it will remain in the box until my little girl wants to wear some play jewelry."
3,While it's pretty online...In person...,"It's too bad that this necklace didn't work out for a gift to my mom. While it shows certain colors online, it came with different colored stones mingled in, which looked a bit funny. Also, it was very heavy and a bit awkward with the way it was beaded (Doubled). It could very well be a great necklace if it was a bit lighter and the colors were true to the description. We sent it back :("
3,Not Bad,"Not Bad, I bought it as I wanted the Platinum in da Ghetto song. I finally got the Lil Keke song Keep on Hustlin' although it wasn't on a Keke Album, it was on a D.O.W.N. album called Southern Slang, also happened it was their song not his. This album was worth buying the Southern Slang Album is worth 5 stars."
3,Don't buy it for children under 8 years old!,"The Kit doll is cute, has little freckles and soft blonde hair. SO WHAT? The doll is cute I admit, but just one thing parents gotta know! I really wanted this doll once and I fussed over and my parents got it for me. I loved the first hour and then I didn't care much about it. The doll is too small and I don't know how you can really play with it. It's body is made of cloth and any kid can pull its arm out when they want to. Sure it is kind of educational teaching you how girls dressed back then, which really doesn't capture your interest or anything. But parents will not enjoy seeing kids throwing the doll and beg for something else. Parents will enjoy this as a collection edition, but otherwise I don't see any need for paying $20 when you can help a family in Africa or do something better!"
4,Monopoly,I bought it for the grand kids and what child doesn't love Monopoly. It is a family favorite. Got to have it
5,DID YOU KNOW? (TIPS FOR YOU ONCE YOU BUY),"-Marven Gardens is spelled incorrectly (It says Marvin Gardens)-You should not buy hotels (to create housing shortages)-The oranges are most landed on-And that you should almost always buy new propertiesIf you do not own any edition of this game, you should not hesitate to buy it. This game is so much fun. You don't know what your missing! Right now I own 11 editions, and I am still getting more."
3,Only with my brother!,"I'll only play this is my brother offers to play, because my sisters, cousins and friends won't sit through it (unless Miguel plays)! It's so long and drawn out that you quickly get bored. My brother livens it up sometimes.Anyway,I've only finished this game twice. Once was in 1998 and me and my brother stayed up until five AM playing it--so we were essentially playing it around four hours.If it's a rainy day with nothing to do and you have older children, it's okay. But otherwise, it's really to long to even bother with."
2,Monopoly is boring but educational,"It's a LOOONNNNGGGG Drawn out game that can get REAL boring. Best if played with 4+ people, NO fun at all with 2.It's an age old game....it's stayed on the market for a reason. I like it, but with a bunch of people and not kids, the kids just get too bored."
3,Guaranteed to start fights,"If you want to have a family fun night playing board games skip this one unless you want a black eye. Everyone you play with becomes evil and someone always quits and the banker always steals money. Seriously I've never once played this game without an argument, and I cant tell you how to win because I dont think anyones ever completed a full game. Its like watching LOTR extended DVD's back to back 5 times in a row."
4,98% American Made,"Except for the dice and tokens, this product was made in the U.S.A. Thank you Parker Brothers for the American bits of this classic game."
1,Possibly the worst game ever,"How anyone can call this game ""classic"" is beyond me. Long play times, player elimination, so much downtime between turns that mostly just involve rolling the dice and moving, it is a wonder anyone ever finishes this game! I don't think I have ever finished this game as you are supposed to, usually everyone finally gets bored and gives up. Stay far away from this game, check out Settlers of Catan, Dominion, or Carcassonne for a good, fun game."
5,Great Game,"Monopoly is a great game. It's really entertaining and fun.Both, kids and adults will love it."
4,Great Real Estate Game,"This is a great game for anyone that is probably 10 or older. The game is all prdicted by a roll of a dice because maybe you could land on Boardwalk, or get thrown in jail. One bad thing about this game always is that it takes too long."
4,Monoply's 'Mazin,"The reason this is rated 4 stars is because it is so much fun to feel like an adult and buy property, have money, pay tax, etc. Also you are just so involved in it. The only reason it's not a perfect five stars is because it takes so long to play. You can set a time, but then it's not as fun. It would probably take a whole day just to play one day if you stopped to have lunch dinner and breakfast. This game would be very good for sleepovers. I give this toy 5 stars educacion because it is just great for math - especially if your the banker. If littler kids play. They have to count numbers going around the board and adding up the dice. Also you have to pay attention so it helps you learn to keep your attention straight or someone may try and cheat you.Finally, it's rated 3 stars for durability because after one time of playing some of my board broke but it is still useable."
5,"A Great Ice Breaker, A Great Game, That's Monopoly","You have got to love this classic game of monopoly! What home is complete with out it! Tons of people can get in and play this game for hours. It's a time occupier and its fun to do also! Family, friends, and this classic game is just filled with fun, fun, fun! Everyone needs their own set, don'tcha know. I know I love mine and I use it all of the time to entertain guests. Monopoly is a great ice breaker when you have new people over. You really get to know them fast."
4,A warning for competitive families!,"I recently played monopoly at a family Christmas gathering. I found that it was very hard for the children to play with the adults because the adults took the game too seriously. It can be a fun game if you have a good attitude, but if you are the competitive type, I do not recommend playing this game with younger family members. Except for this, monopoly is a fun and educating game."
3,Great game; very poor quality board,I'm not sure why the game manufacturers thought it would be a good idea to have the board fold twice into a square; the result is that ours tore and was unusable within a month after purchase.
2,Not very good quality,I bought this to replace a game we have. The houses and hotels are plastic and just overall cheap. The deluxe edition was what I was replacing. Ordering that one soon :)
3,Classic Monopoly,"After 5 uses, I can already tell that the fold up game board is not going to last very long. This is the basic, no frills, classic game of monopoly."
5,So you want your kids to grow up to be capitalists?,"I lived for this game when I was a kid! I would beg my sister, my parents, friends, anyone whom I thought would sit down with me and enjoy a little cut-throat business excitement. After a while, though, nobody would play me anymore because I always won. But I still love this game. I've never played any board game that even comes close to Monopoly. Socialists beware: this is a game for vicious capitalists! If you want your kids to drink herbal teas, hug trees, and talk about their feelings, don't get them this game! It's designed for the coldblooded, calculating business types. This game is an American Institution! I love it!!!"
2,Monopoly...ICK,"While monopoly is an OK game to play when you are completely and absolutely bored with nothing else to do...any other time it is a complete waste of time. Monopoly is a game based almost completely on luck, so you don't even learn anything like you do in most boring games. It takes forever to finish and about halfway through most people are ready to quit, my little sister once made me play all the way through with her and it took the whole day! It was awful. It's pretty durable except all that paper money gets lost really easily, and those pieces you move around the bored are also easily lost. With nothing else to do monopoly is a good waste of time, but any other time it is pure and simple a bad waste of time!"
4,The Bomb Digity,This game was super fun. But most of the peices either ripped or were lost. It is a brain challenging game. Math is involved. It is trully the bomb digity.
2,Monopoly is a piggy Republican game,"Monopoly is somewhat educational as far as the business world goes--but ultimately it's a a piggy, greedy Republican game. Don't play it a lot. You'll raise unpleasant kids. [And no, I'm not a Democrat.] Can't American toy makers come up with something more creative than the 1000th version of Monopoly?"
1,When will we wake up,"It's about time people admitted that this is the worst board game ever invented.Totally devoid of anything needed to win other than luck of the die this game is about roll and move... roll and move... repeat.Eventually people will begin to trade, if you do not the game will never end. Someone will trade something they shouldn't have, and the dice will then (eventually) cause that person to lane on something they can not pay for. Where is the skill, where is the fun?Let's add to this that the great time of a game can take 4 to 5 hrs to finish. Features player elimination so that a few of the people will have to sit around and watch the game grind to an end or maybe find something else to do for a few hours.Why do people keep buying this? There are better games. Much better games exist out there. These games involve thinking, and can be finished in less than 2 hours. You can find them by going to Google and searching on ""board game"".Think about it before you buy this stinker."
5,Fun Game for the whole Family!,"My whole family loves this game!It's challenging and fun!Buy lands,Railroads,and more! And the whole family is so proud of whoever made up this game!~*Melissa~*"
1,No good,"This Monopoly is pretty lousy. The Money is not the classic Monopoly colors or quality. Flimsy paper. The property cards are not the same as the original either. Rectangles instead of sqaures. The chance cards and chest cards are wierd colors. The dice or subpar. I bought this because I wanted THE ORIGINAL MONOPOLY SETUP. Everyone sells the modern versions, special edition, etc. I wanted this b/c i don't want the bells and whistles, and this was a disappointment."
4,Overall good but poor money tray design,"My kids love this game which is why I bought it. There are some design changes from the original Parker Brothers game. For example, the board folds twice into a square and the Chance and Community Chest cards are a different color. That didn't bother me. What does bother me every time I play this game is the incredibly poor design of the money tray compared to the original game. This money tray is a joke and hardly worth using given how much trouble is involved in trying to keep the money from constantly falling over. Clearly the person who designed it didn't bother to test it. The manufacturer needs to go back to the previous Parker Brother money tray design, which was great and so convenient."
3,What I Think About Monopoly,"Have you ever played Monopoly? This fun game was created by the Parker Brothers. You get to save money and own properties. Wether you believe it or not you can even go to jail!This game is really cool! It has properties that you can own written around the edges of the board.This game also contains fake money. And also metal figurines,cards, and a set of dice.The gist of the game is to go around the board as many times as possible and own as much money as you can. You also have to spend your money wisely. When you go to jail you have to pay a fine in order to get out. You get to own propertis such as,hotels and houses. Another thing about this game is to make your opponent go bankrupt . That's what this game is about.I give this game Monopoly 3 out of 5 stars.It's a good game, but not the best game I ever played. I do recommend people to play monopoly!"
5,great fun!,"great fun, we payed with my spouse and six year old,he learned a great deal about money, we got into thewhole buying and trading thing so much, that we got intoan argument! it was pretty funny, the game lasted for about 4 hours.If your planning on buying this game, make sure you have time to waste!"
5,"""SIEGEL180"", WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT???","To ""Siegel180"": Did your inability to play this CD on your computer or car merit you giving it a one star review? C'mon! You're being ridiculous! My copy of Jakatta's Vision plays fine on my computer and in my car and everywhere else. And on top of that it's a great sounding CD! Although not particularly groundbreaking and sometimes comparable to the much played out ""Ibiza-Sound,"" Visions is still impressive with downtempo tracks like ""It Will Be"", ""So Lonely"", ""Feelin' Blue"", ""One Fine Day"", ""Other World"", ""Home Away From You"" and ""Strung Out""--and stellar dance tracks like ""American Dream"", ""I Don't Know"" and ""Ride The Storm"". I'm not a big Seal fan, so I'm not really impressed with ""My Visions""--the original, or the remix. I would've much rather prefered the Afterlife remix of ""American Dream"" as heard on the Ultra Chilled Volume 1 disc instead. And a note to all reviewers: Just cuz you bought a defective CD doesn't mean give it a one star review!!!"
3,A Good First Half,"The first half of Visions by Jakatta is really good, but after ""American Dream"", the album falls to pieces. The last 2 tracks are just fillers. ""Strung Out"" is a a modified mix of most of the first 7 tracks played at a slower tempo. ""I Don't Know"" tops out as my favorite on the album.3/5 stars."
4,Original? Reinvented,"Well. It seems that at least some of the music on this album is not original. American Dream (Intro) is a very mild remix of Any Other Name by Thomas Newman and Feelin Blue is clearly a remix of Cargo Voyage. Listen to the soundtrack to Betty Blue if you don't believe me. Have a listen to Porcelain by Moby and you'll discover the melody to I Dont Know. Why they couldn't use the original titles of the tracks I don't know. But, the music is excellent. I bought it."
2,Just OK,I am a avid History Buff.I was also very disappointed in the details shared in this book.The Japanese were and I beleive would be be brutal soldiers in need be.Americans need to be a bit more aware of our many enemies unding undar rat infested man hole covers and holes all over the world and remember to always Never giver them any quarter.Just as they would never do the same for us.
3,"Scale Aircraft Modelling ""Mark Stanton""","I was looking for a book with details on weathering and all other kinds of advanced effects you could apply to your models. Something apart from the basics, I decided on this book because it looked like what I was looking for, but it turned out to be pretty basic with hardly any pictures of each model created, especially the building process. Each model built in this book has a max of 4 pics and not detailed at all. Not a great book, I've seen better."
2,not jumbo at all,"I ordered 2 copies of this, based on how much I love Mepham's ""Total Sudoku"" -- but I wish I hadn't. It has 2 puzzles per page instead of one large puzzle per page as shown on the cover. Mepham's ""Total Sudoku"" has one puzzle per page -- which is wonderful. There is no reason to want an awkward 8 X 10 page except to get a really big grid. If I'm going to have half-page-size puzzles, give me a half-page-size book that is easier to hold. And this does not have any 16 by 16 puzzles, which are my favorites. And the answer grids are TINY."
4,A Good Introduction to the Game of Sudoku,"Michael Mepham provides this workbook full of Sudoku puzzles. They range from easy to, in his words, fiendish. Each puzzle has a solution printed in the back. While there are two puzzles per page, they are nevertheless bigger than those in newspapers, and certainly bigger than those in most if not all electronic Sudoku kits. There are some unconventional Sudoku puzzles, including those which form an X-shape of five nested Sudoku sub-puzzles.Some tips are given in the beginning of the book for the solving of Sudoku puzzles. These include the use of clues provided by numbers that are remote from each other on the puzzle. For very difficult situations, Mepham recommends that the puzzle-solver narrow a spot to two possibilities, then take a guess at one of the two numbers and see if it creates a self-consistent solution."
4,Jumbo Sudoku Books Allow Room for Annotation,"This book is well designed and makes it easy to carry out some of the brute force methods of solving Sudoku puzzles. However, is section on how to solve the puzzles is so elementary as to be practically useless for anyone who has done even a few Sudoku puzzles on their own."
3,Fairly Fine Cup of Tea...,"This raspberry tea from Ahmad's of England, makes an acceptable cup of tea. However, the flavoring was a bit weak for my taste. A couple of reviewers referenced the raspberry flavor as strong and/or tart, whilst I found it to be neither. I would call this a medium-bodied black tea, with a rather light, red raspberry flavor. Fortunately, I found that a bit of sugar really helped to enhance the flavor. No adverse aftertastes were detected. It's four o'clock somewhere...tea time, anyone?"
5,It's ONLY Tea!,"It's Tea. It was fresh, delivered quickly and is delicious. It's tea.However, Amazon is telling me my tea review has to be ""at least twenty words describing your experience with this item"" before it will publish my review. To that I say: It's ONLY TEA guys!!""OK then. Here goes. I put the filtered water in the Sunbeam Hot Shot Single-serve Beverage Maker and boil the water. Then, with deft agility at 5:30am, dispense the water into my favorite - and only - ceramic Starbuck's coffee cup. I follow that by placing the tea bag in said cup, then steeping said tea bag in previously mentioned boiling water for precisely 90 seconds. Afterwards, placing teabag in teaspoon while carefully wrapping teabag string around said teabag and spoon to squeeze out every drop of Rasberry goodness. Then, drink slowly and adoringly.Wow, how was it for you? I need a cigarette.Please rate this review. LOL :P"
1,rgw5944,"I bought this raspberry tea on the previous recommendation however after brewing a pitcher of it, I find there is ZERO raspberry flavor in it. I tied 2 different strengths, brewing with 4 bags and 2 bags with the same result, Tastes like straight black tea. Wasted $20. I guess I'll have to stay with Walmart brand instant raspberry tea. At least it has a good flavor although there is a little to much sugar for my preference."
1,Did not Meet my Needs,"I was very disappointed by this product and plan to return the item. Their are no instructions as to how to attach my speaker wire. I had to contact the manufacturer to get instructions and the person I spoke with also had a hard time figuring out how to make the attachment. Between the two of us - ""we think we figured it out."" However the biggest problem is the pins are too long. When I plug the wire into my speaker splitter box, there is too much of the plug sticking out so the plug is not held firmly. I bought these because of the price compared with other similar plugs but I guess I will have to pay more to get what I want."
4,Elmore Leonard does it again,"I've read at least 15 of Leonard's books and La Brava is among the best. His writing is to the point, it makes you feel like you're in downtown or Miami(or Detroit, etc) and his characters remind you of some of the characters, especially the shady one's you come across in a big city. La Brava has it all...suspense, humor, mystery, romance. If you enjoy this book you'll love his others. Try reading Killshot or 52-Pick Up."
3,Great Dialogue,"I enjoyed this book very much. It's kind of a Film Noir book style. It's somewhat of a mystery for the reader, but there is a lot of humaness too. You can just see the interaction between the characters and the Miami South Beach area. We have movie stars and detectives. We have some bad guys, but they are kind of goofy so that makes it interesting too. Leonard is a master of dialogue and there are many, many subtleties therein. Can you guess the outcome? Well part way maybe, but I am thinking you won't get it 100%."
5,A Pure Delight,"Reading ""LaBrava"" provided me the most fun I can remember with a novel. It's my sixth Leonard novel, and it's my favorite without a close second. All the things you expect from Leonard are present here - vivid portraits of a slimy setting, colorful and dynamic characters, and snappy, pitch-perfect dialogue.What's more present in ""LaBrava"" than in the other Leonard works I've read are a truly likable hero and a spicy, entrancing romance.If you're looking for an introduction to Leonard but aren't sure where to start, look no further. ""LaBrava"" is a classic."
2,Sleepy Time,"La Brava almost put me asleep in the beginning, in fact it did. And then I woke up and lost interest and then I read about a half dozen more books until I picked this one up again and made it my New Years resolution that I had to finish it. I understand its one of Leonard's earlier works, so maybe that is why it was so hard to find. I like the way Leonard writes & the way his characters talk but this story is cheesy & regret wasting time on it."
5,A sensitive & balanced accounting that examines opposing views between Euro-American culture & Native American culture,"Part memoir, part local history, Buried Indians: Digging Up the Past in a Midwestern Town tells about a struggle in the Trempealeau, Wisconsin hometown of author Laurie McMillin (associate professor of rhetoric, composition and religion) to determine whether the platform mounds atop Trempealeau Mountain constituted authentic Indian mounds. A sensitive and balanced accounting that examines opposing views between the dominant Euro-American culture and Native American culture, Buried Indians makes every effort to accurately portray not only the conflict of political agendas but also offer clear insight into what the platform mounds truly represented to different individuals. A highly recommended insight into cultural relations, regional history, and the lessons that can be drawn for future American government-Native American relations."
1,Read before renting or buying....,"If you are reading this review to sort out if you might want to rent this or buy it - this may help: DON'T!!! It is not scary, nor is it (intentionally) funny. The plot is boring, the acting poor, and the CGI sharks are laughably bad. This is a simple review for a simple movie... I hope it helps..."
5,Deep blue sea meets die hard,"The following film for which this review is rated PG-13 for some action seqeunce, violence, and occasional brief strong language.What do you get when you cross die hard with Jaws. You get the 2005 made for television now on DVD movie Blue Demon. When a top secret counter terrorist project Blue Demon is sabotaged by some one connected to the project. It is up to two scientific researchers on the project Maria Played by Debee Pfeiffer and her ex husband Nathan Randall Batnkoff to stop six governmentally enhanced great whites. From turning the local bathers into shark burritos. Can they shop these six terrors and stop the diabolical mastermind who has stolen a Russian case bomb before it is delivered shark express to it's designated location. Find out in the thrilling action packed conclusion."
1,Genetically engineered sharks that...,"swim so slowly almost EVERYONE they attack has no problem getting away from them. The scientist warns (at the beginning and end of the film) that they did something terrible in creating these sharks. I agree. If such sharks ever bred, the world's shark population would starve, as these things were completely unable to catch anything. (If you can't catch a floundering human, how are you supposed to catch a creature adapted to swimming.)"
2,God bless Jeff Fahey,"Okay, this was a terrible movie done on a very small budget. The plot was stupid, the acting bad, and the special effects were anything but special.. Could easily be a movie that gets one star with a disclaimer that it only gets one star because we can't give it less. HOWEVER...Jeff Fahey plays a ""patriotic"" American general, and he is so over the top, so into hamming it up that I think the movie is worth seeing just for his performance. It's a bad performance, but you have to believe he knew it was bad while performing it. You have to be pretty bored to watch this one, but hey...I made it throuh the whole thing. Barely."
1,Not Worth Having,"I have been in the antiques business for 35 years. I have NEVER found an unusual mark in this book. It resides at the back of my closet, I never use it and probably never will. Problem is, I can't find any book on pottery marks that does do the job. The Kovels annual price guides are also a fat waste of money, don't bother."
1,HIGHLY OVER-RATED BOOK,"As usual, Kovel's book is receiving much underserved praise. Most buyers of his books are amateurs who have heard his name so much they assume his books are actually of some value. Well, they're not! This book has far too many errors and leaves far, far, far, far too much for the user to GUESS at. Not worth buying."
4,"Kovels"" Book of Marks",This is a great book for looking up marks............but as a freind once told me no one knows it all .....and either do the Kovels. Some marks are crying for more information..others..are dying to be included here.Still...I feel they worked long and hard compiling this much infoand if you need some of it ....a lot will be found in this book.
3,A Good Flea Market Book,"Ralph and Terry Kovel's book is good for the beginner who is just getting a feel for the wide range of items to be found at the yard sale or flea market. A Dictionary it's not. If you can't yet tell new from old. German from Japanese, English from American, then this is a good place to start. To become truly knowledgeable and informed you must move on. Still, all in all not a bad reference for the money."
3,Prefer The Antique Trader 2004 Value Guide on Porcelain,"I love Limoges and purchase price guides that help me with that particular area of collecting. I prefer the authors of these type of pricing guide go to the experts like THE ANTIQUE TRADER did when they went to author Debby DuBay. If you want to know about Limoges, suggest you read Ms DuBay's works. Suggest Kovel's collaborate with the experts and their works will be more complete."
3,Recommend readers go to the experts vs this book.,Suggest the Kovel's would use leading experts in the field to write each section and provide photos. The Kovel's have made an industry out of antiquing. They are too commerical - where is the expertise and passion? Colaborate with leading experts and you have a winning book for all of us!
4,Kovels New Dictionary of Marks,"This is a good resource book. It has it's limitations, but I use it almost daily. I look up alot of ceramics marks, and I find the large majority of them in this Kovels book. It is great if you are looking for a specific makers mark, or decoratoras mark. The limitation is that there is no way to comprehensively view all marks from one particular maker. If you have a few treasures that you want to accurately identify, then it is very good. Don't get me wrong, I haven't found every mark I look for. But I haven't found a Marks reference that I do. This book provides a good clean and easy format to locate the mark I need, and quickly.Also, if you are looking for back ground info on the company, this isn't the book for you. While the Kovel's do an excellent job of showing literal thousands of easy to find marks, thats all they show. All in all a highly recommended resource. Any serious ceramics collector, dealer, or dedicated flea market/yard saler should have a copy."
2,Kovels' New Dictionary of Marks Pottery & Porcelain 1850 to the Present,"I haven't been happy with this book since I purchased it. Haven't found one mark from any of the pottery or china I have from this book. Only one or maybe two examples of the companies which made the pottery but not the marks. For example I can't even find the simple ""Anchor"" from Anchor Hawking Co.(There are plenty of other anchors). I have a very nice Blue ""Old Fashion""/juice glass fron A.H. but I have never seen one in blue. Looked it up and could not find MARK in this book. I was very surprised. I've been thinking about purchasing the Second Edition of Kovels' book, but been holding back... Can anyone tell me if it is better or if it's just me, I hope..Mary, techmom@usamedia.tv (No Solicitors Please! Only those wanting to talk about this book please reply. NO SPAMMERS!!)"
5,awesome,"Great reference book!!!! Love it, has about everything you was to look up inside, great pictures and nice to use"
5,Great reference book,I have found several manufacturer's marks in this book that are not in my other books. Marks are clear and easy to evaluate. Good information also. I recommend this book.
5,Very necessary for those who collect pottery and porcelain!,Great addition to my collection! They have done it again. Brought us a necessary bible of sorts and a great reference.
5,Great for beginners and advanced collectors alike!,"I purchased this book to find information on porcelain manufacturers because I'm just getting started on collecting porcelain tea cups and demitasse sets. It has great info, it's well organized and easy to use. It has domestic manufacturers as well as foreign and will be a big help to anyone who uses it. It also has a great helper in the back: an explanation of and chart for dating the old-style English registry marks. I found out I have a plate made Dec. 3, 1855 from looking in this book. Buy it. It's a big help."
2,Where's the mark!,"I was truly not happy with this book. All I know of the Kovels what I've seen of them on TV. This is the first book I picked up authored by the pair and it will probably be the last. The last twelve marks I have tried to identify have not been in this book. Though I find the chapter layout of the book helpful, what is missing is content."
1,Prefer the Antique Trader 2004 Price Guide,"The same old thing. I can't recommend this guide. On the other hand, the Antique Trader 2004 Price Guide is based on the experts who have contributed to this wonderful book. Kyle's Antique Trader Price Guide even provides the shops they used as references. I have them both, but I can not recommend Kovel's but I do recommend the 2004 ANTIQUE TRADER!"
4,Kovels' New Dictionary of Marks : Pottery and Porcelain 1850 to Present (Kovel's Dictionary of Marks),"Overall it is helpful. I am really just getting into this, so it is great to have something I can refer to to get an idea of where the item I have comes from."
4,Good reference book,Marks on pottery have always been of interest to me. Some are obvious and well-known and others obscure. Couldn't find all the marks I was looking for. Still a good book to have.
2,Lack of Content,"I purchased this book in hopes of identifying various pieces of porcelain and pottery. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find any of them in this book. I even looked up a well-known mark that I already know about and discovered it, too, was not included in this book.This book lacks content and I would not recommend it.I purchased the book after reading several positive reviews. I thought it might be helpful to others to know that buying this book could possibly be a source of frustration.It receives 2 stars instead of 1 because the lay-out is good and contains a thorough index."
2,a little more help would be nice,"It was a very informative book, but I guess you would almost have to have been an avid collector to understand it. Really, it should have been done to make is easier for the beginning collector to understand. I have markings not in the book and the companies and markings are all scattered. My oppinion they companies marking should have been together with the different years they used that mark. and if there were extra marks used with that company when were they used and why. not at all helpful to me, maybe after i can siphon the books code to understand it better it will be more helpful. sorry just being honest as I am new to collecting and would like to better know what to look for."
3,"Good, but a bit confusing.","More a book for someone who knows what they are looking at or for. I'm a novice so there's a lot of work involved in researching. However, I'm not disappointed in the book and I'm glad I made the purchase."
2,Not too happy with CD bought on Amazon,"This CD was heard on Pandora on my computer. The songs that I heard was the type of Irish music that I like, but that was only a couple of songs. The rest of the songs on the CD were more protest songs than the light fast jigs that I like when I hear Irish music. I would like to hear more songs on the CD before I buy the CD on Amazon."
5,Simply phenomenal,"An amazing visual compendium of the master practicing his craft.Includes interviews and performances, and with subtitles in English available so that you can really get a feel for how his mind works when he's being interviewed.Also includes the complete ""Melody Nelson"" featuring Jane Birkin go-going!Music videos and performance clips range from his very early days to his dirty old man days.All in all, it's pretty much perfect."
4,a 60's Marlboro commercial?,"Nobody holds a cigarette like Serge. Nobody holds a song together like Serge. Its like he's so relaxed, he's about to drop it. Remember to check out the Bridget Bardot bookend collection."
1,This European format DVD will NOT play on our American format,"This EUROPEAN format DVD did not play on either my Sony, Onkyo and Panasonic DVD players at home or in my Jeep."
3,Give me my old Risk,"Help! I wanted to introduce my children to the Joy of Risk, but I see that they have ""improved"" this classic game. While the additional breakdown of military forces may add interest to older children and adults, it adds complexity to what was a fiendishly simple game, playable by much younger children. I guess I am left to search antique stores and the web for a copy of the old version. Unfortunately, the computer version (of the original Risk) I have is much too easily defeated for real enjoyment."
3,Great game for teen boys on a Saturday night,"This is one of those games that can go hours and hours.It can be fun, or a real drag if you get stuck in the begining with a few lousy countries/territories and the other players gang up on you.This is definitely not a good child/adult game or even a good game for fun party play, it takes too much time and several players always end up losing early on, leaving the other players, sometimes just two of them, going back and forth for a long time.It's a good strategy war based game, it just needs to be played with the right crowd."
5,Great way to kill an afternoon,"On those long saturday afternoons, my friends and I like to pull out one of our risk boards and start a game. We're lucky if we finish, but a complete game or not, we always have fun. Not only do we play the normal way, we have added army limits on each territory to make the game much more strategic. Psycological warfare plays a major part in our games too. If you want to spend a fun afternoon with a good group of people, pull your risk board out of the closet and start a game"
1,item pictured was not delivered.,I ordered the game Risk. Many versions over the years have been developed. I wanted the one pictured but received an older one. =(
5,Outstanding Game for Family!,"This game will provide HOURS of family fun, or one-on-one fun! I highly recommend this game to anyone!"
1,Risk is a great game but this version is CHEAPLY MADE IN CHINA!!!!,"Nothing against Risk. This version cost a little fortune compared to other board games and I was expecting something refined. Instead it is clearly cheaply made in China!! I'm not expecting the cards to last long, they are very thing and flexible!! The little soldiers are not made of solid rubber but cheap plastic! don't expect them to last either...This is definitely a rip off!!!In Europe you can get the Tournament version for around $70 and everything is HIGH QUALITY!! you even get a place to through your dice made of green velvet!! the miniature are made of solid rubber/plastic and you have reusable plastic bags for each color! On the contrary in this version you have to cut the bags and that's it ( I use elastics to keep them closed)..Do not spend your money on this one! try and look a better version.."
5,It's Risk....,"It's Risk. If you haven't played, buy it.If you have played, the only knock I give to this version is the small pieces. The colors they chose have poor contrast, especially during the wee morning hours that this game inevitably lasts until. The pieces themsevles are too small, especially the small soldiers, making unit counting a pain.But it's the original board, with the original game rules. It's the classic, and the last place I could find it.Ukraine is weak!"
5,"The board game ""Risk"", isn't! It's wonderful!","I wanted to keep 5 teenage boys amused- usually impossible! So, I bought a couple of large pizzas and 3 liters of Pepsi, and for 5 hours straight they were great! No girls, on time, no drinking or dope. What could you ask for? This has been going on for a month now...Who said boy teenagers were the worst! I love my 17 year olds."
4,Risk is Good,"Hey, ever wondered how Napoleon, or maybe Ivan the terrible felt? Now you can! The board is realistically based on ""the world"" as they knew it then... If you are a fan of strategic turn-based warfare that doesn't kill people (unless you're a sore loser), buy Risk; NOW."
3,"risk is fun, but not a repeat","when i played risk my friend went and taught me.of course he always won. risk is all about war and luck. the first time you play risk is really ffun.but afterawhile its all the same conquer the world and be the best.the reason why it is a little educational because it teaches strategy a little. its not that durabel because you could loose those tiny solders in the carpet. risk is fun to play but it is the game you shouldnt buy. risk is good to play at a friends house ,not buy itt."
2,risk,"ok, first off im 16. When i first heard about risk i thought it would be pretty fun. well, risk is a fun game but there is to much luck involved. for example an army of 2 soliders can take out an army of 10 soliders with rolling the right numbers.it is a pretty easy strategy game to learnbut it gests very old easily and you can end up angry beacause you got terribel dice rolls and your friends got better rolls.its educational because it teaches some strategy. and the durability you can loose the pieces. if you want a real fun strategy game then get axis and allies which will sure give you a good time"
4,ok,"when i first heard about this game i expected a lot more than it gave.my friends told me this game was good and they werent lyin there.its fun even though its missing core strategy and is focused around luck.4 example my cousin usually rolls sixes on his dice while i roll 4s so im afraid of attacking him. i do like that there are many variations of the game so if u get bored of playin it 1 way try another and u might like it betta.if u like strategy games and wars theres no reason u shouldnt get this.but word of advice:only buy this game if u have spare time during the week and enjoy making diplomacies.(even though its hard to in this game.)hope i helped u in makin the right decision.if you like this game and have a big budget,i would highly reccomend buying risk 2210a.d."
2,"Simple, random, unfun","Risk's overly simple rules make strategic thinking useless. The concept of the ""turn"" is invalidated by the ability of armies to attack (and advance) without limit. This means that a lone, large army can march across an entire continent--yes, an ENTIRE CONTINENT--in a single turn.And that lone, large army can come from anywhere. Armies can sprout up anywhere, at any time. This means that a surrounded territory with a lone soldier can suddenly grow to a vast army in a single turn. This is unrealistic.Once a player is on the ropes, there is virtually no hope of ever returning to the offensive and the game then drags on while the dominating player mops up. This is fun for no one.If you want a fun, strategic game, DO NOT BUY RISK."
5,GOOD GAME,"This game tought me to use stratedgy,it is an educartional game,and a great for me and my dad,when it rains out we hav loads of fun!!"
4,Good game - but I miss the army boxes,"We bought this game of risk to replace our old game, which was lost in a move. There are several differences in the new risk and the old risk. One difference is the mission cards. At first I was disapointed that the mission cards were not the same as the old risk, but after playing a few games, I admit that it is just as much fun. The other difference with the game is the lack of army boxes. The old game came with a clear plastic box to store each army color in. This game does not have boxes, just wells in the box to store each color. The clear boxes were quite useful during the game as you spend a lot of time taking armies out and putting armies in the box as you lose or gain reinforcements. I find the lack of boxes a pain as pieces fall on the floor etc. when you just have them piled on the table. However, it is still a great game and we are happy with this version."

4,GREAT!!!!,"One of the best CDs I have, great dance CD, I would say its a great mix of House/Techno/Dance. Its awesome for listening to when doing cardio or any other workout. I would really be lost if this disappeared from my collection. Definetly a must for all Clubbers."
5,Excellent DVD Player,"After coming from a two year old Philips Magnavox DVD Player that I found great, I decided to move up to this Panasonic model because of it's features, Panasonic's reputation for quality products, and it's price.This machine has been superb. Pictures are just as crystal clear as the Philips, the additional play speeds are extremely useful, there is no longer any of the freeze-frame I occasionally had with the Philips, and it starts up the movie extremely quickly. The remote is extremely intuitive to use, albeit a little small. The unit itself feels extremely well built. To top all this off, the price of this player is only a few dollars more than the base DVD Player from Panasonic, making it a great deal.This DVD Player is a great introductory DVD Player or one for someone looking to replace an aging DVD Player for not a lot of money. It's worth it."
5,nice poster!,"This is an excellent quality poster. I bought it for my husband, who was a huge Earnhardt fan. I'm sure he will be very happy when he sees this."
4,An excellent guide for anyone on beginning the martial arts.,"This is an excellent guide for anyone wishing to start studying the martial arts. Although it focuses on the concerns women might have, 95% of the material would be good for parents wanting to enroll their children in martial arts classes or any adult.I have been studying kung fu for almost 4 years and I think much of her advice would have been helpful for me. I have loaned my copy to my instructor because he was very interested in a woman's point of view because he likes to have his work critiqued so he can improve. (He's always done a great job with his women students.)The book covers a large range of topics from the history of women over the centuries in the martial arts, an overview of various styles, how to pick a good school, what success really means, and pointers for feeling comfortable at a first class.Great book."
2,Fun but deeply flawed,"When I read this book I had great hopes. Women are often unwelcome in the martial arts world, and a guide which addresses women's concerns would be welcome. Unfortunately, AWGtMA restricts rather than expands horizons. The good parts reflect the author's love of Japanese Karate. The parts which address anything else are weak, and the range of martial arts studied gives a very non-representative picture of the field - more caricatures than descriptions and very limited in scope. The descriptions of martial arts training and etiquette are only applicable to the style she studies and should not be taken as a general guide. This could have been an excellent book if the writer had only educated herself a little more."
1,Just din't get it,"Seriously... My main problem with this is the shipping. They consider shipping in Guam,USA as international when we use USPS. so i waited for 5-6 weeks for my first issue when i received it, the front and back were torn. And sadly since that day i haven't received the replacement which is the September 2010 issue and the other issues after that. So messed up. And by the way Conde-Nast told me that for these situations ""I"" should contact the post and sort out the situation. Nice customer service right?! Just plain awesome"
2,I use to like GQ,"I was an avid subscriber for many years; however, I have found it has become much more similar to Details than what GQ was. Can't really explain it, except that it has become more of a skin mag than anything."
1,Receive much later than arrives in store,I bought this for my son and every issue has been about 2 weeks behind. We most most likely would not renew. He loves the book but would like to get is at the same time it arrives in the stores not a few weeks later.
5,Perfect christmas gift for the guys,It's the gift that literally keeps giving. Birthday? I'm covered. New Year's? I'm covered. Christmas? I'm covered. So simple. And next year I'll just renew it again!
4,GQ Magazine,"We think that GQ still has alot to offer men looking to stay on top of the fashion trends, they always have a fresh new attitude and look[...]"
4,this magazine is ok,yeah it has alot of information of whats going on and good samples of colone but the too many pictures of guys
2,Actually about 2 1/2 stars,"The style in this magazine is incredible; it's expensive and very fashionable, with the occasional cheap item to cater to the peasant reader (i.e., everyone).That said, the magazine is rife with flaws. Snobbish east-coast writing, awful music that is lauded for no reason other than its anonymity, still worse book reviews of Norman Mailer-style authors, shrill articles by naive hacks, and so on.The clothes are great, but buy with caution."
3,Good magazine if you like to look at ads...,"This magazine has some good information, but it is hard to find with all the ads in the magazine. This magazine has tons of ads that surround its few articles. The articles it does have are generally good, but there are just SOOOO many ads. The ads are all over and it is the main reason the magazine is so large. This magazine could be a lot better with half as many ads and a few more articles."
1,"GQ is great for pictures, NOT FOR READING!!","ok so i just bought my first issue of GQ this month. compared to other men's fashion magizens, like Details, it is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! all i suggest someone who is thinking of buying this magizine for the first time, go check it out in a store first because i was VERY disappointed"
1,It has been a downhill ride for GQ...,"Over the past several years the publication has found its way to the bottom of the barrel typically reserved for Maxim, FHM and Stuff. Writing is nowhere near where it is used to be. Most of the interviews are lame. A third of each edition is filled with meaningless ads you typically see in media that targets women. Speaking of women, miraculously, all of the models shown in magazine are still clothed which brings me to the next question: How is GQ still in business?No, thank you."
1,Won't sync across ipad iPhone or kindle fire,"Don't expect Conde Nast applications to synchronize across your various tablets or phones you are lucky if you can sign in , I have a kindle fire, iPad and iPhone and its only Conde Nast magazines that I have issues with, I have Cancelled all my subscriptions, I travel a lot and thought that the Conde Nast apps would be ideal to keep me busy and of course save on bulky magazines! Sadly Conde Nast has let me down terribly!"
2,All Celebrity,"This used to be a really good magazine that I subscribed to for years. They used to have really good indepth articles on veterans, war, culture. Over time it became more like People magazine: a constant onslaught of celebrity, which I find B-O-R-I-N-G. You can get that for free at TMZ--if you want to."
4,Better than most,"I've sub-scribed to GQ for about a year now. Having gone through a recent editorial change, the fashion angle of the magazine seems to be tilting more towards the ""hipster"" set, and less on classic fasion. Case in point - ""How to pull off jeans and a hoodie w/ you suit coat""? Yeah - that'll fly in the corporate ranks.A recent spread on English suits what closer to what I would call the classic side, but a set of threads from Seville Row is out of the reach of most men at around two grand US. Plus, there is quite a bit of skin to try and at lest keep up with the Maxim's and FHM's. Not nearly as much, but it's there.Nonetheless, for those flaws, there is plenty of good writing and you'll at least get a sense of where fashion is heading. Am I going to drop six bills for a Prada cashmere turtleneck - probably not, but could something simliar be had for a fraction of that? Absolutely."
2,"Very unconventional format, Hard to read","I'm not crazy about this magazine. A lot of the fashion is a little too metrosexual and childish at times. Also, the arrangement of stories on the pages is very peculiar. Cluttered is the best way to describe it. It hurts my eyes. I get headaches trying to read it."
5,BEST EVER!,This is my all time favorite magazine of all time. It can appeal to everyone! It has articles ranging from sports to cars to clothes to relationships. Love it more than anything!!!! I have read every one since 2001!
1,Amazing,"I have looked through Cosmopolitan, Marie claire, Mens health etc. but this is the most ""empty"" mind numbing magazine I have ever read, I just paid $5 for it yesterday, opened it when I got home and discovered the first 15 ( that's right I said fifteen!!!) pages of advertising!!!Why would anyone buy this magazine??"
3,Why so late,I ordered this magazine along with another. The other magazine came one month before this one. I don't understand .....why so late.
3,"Read six, read 'em all","GQ is kinda the same thing year after year. Read it for six months and you'll be armed with all the sartorial dude information you need for the the next 5 years. Dark jeans, thin ties, no pleats, jacket shorter than hand grip, ad nauseam... Esquire is a more literate magazine if you must have something like this on the crapper."
5,"The men's magazine for ""men of letters""....","GQ is still the definitive men's style magazine, but it's also much more. The monthly mixology column is slowly helping me build a bartenders guide that is informative as well as useful, The Style Guy is keeping me from looking like an idiot, and the fiction and features are keeping me full of interesting stories to help me sing for my supper. The bottom line is this: if you want a magazine with guy advice... but don't want something as snarky or ""hip"" as Maxim or FHM then GQ has just the kind of class you're looking for."
3,not worth it,"Always a great magazine but do to the fact the subscription magazines are nearly 1/4th the size of the newstand editions, Im giving 1/4th the stars. Theres no cologne ads and getting it a day earlier then the stores really isnt that important to me."
4,Not just for guys!,"After being tired of all the so-called women's magazines out there that didnt seem to discuss anything but crappily laid out beauty techniques and superficial articles (big exception is Bust which I love) I decided to pick up a men's magazine for novelty and peruse it. A couple months of men's magazines later I had my subscription! Lot's of techy, political and amusing things inside. There's also the added benefit of lot's of guys with their shirts off. I'd recommend it to women if you're looking for something beyond crack addicted bone thin models and three-step instructions for looking like them and want something mentally stimulating for only about $10."
3,Picture Books For Big Boys............,"I do not have a subscription, and am a female. I have bought this product for interviews with Justin Timberlake in it. It floored me seeing all these advertisements. I understand it is a magazine primarily about latest hip clothes, but it could have articles on why it's cool, price ranges, or comparison buying, and how to get these advertised items.I have a good selection of various periodicals, and note GQ has a greater number of ads than ""Teen People,"",""YM,"" and other similiar publications."
4,2nd year of subscribing!,"I subscribe to 3 mens magazines:- Best Men- Esquire- GQOf the 3, GQ has possibly the best style tips, merchandise, and fashion articles. However, the other articles aren't so well written as Esquire, whose approach is usually on the humorous side. Best Men, well, it has a very down-to-earth approach to writing, which may or may not be loved (sometimes I find it a little too serious of a tone in a magazine).All in all, each magazine serves an individual purpose, which is why I still continue to subscribe to GQ!"
3,"good, but not great","I am a fan of Maxim, but ordered GQ for a change of pace. I would have to say, it seems that GQ is trying to copy Maxim. It's not as good reading as it used to be.Takes several minutes to rip out all the flyers and perfume ads. If you cut out all the ads, you would be left with a brochure."
2,I actually wouldn't ever read this mag EXCEPT,"The New Yorker's ex-film critic, Terrance Rafferty, writes for GQ on occasion and he's the best in the business.No idea what prompted his transistion to this mag, but there you go. Maybe they're trying to raise the bar a little."
3,GQ Magazine,"My husband was somewhat happy with this magazine, but not as happy as he was with popular science. I, however, picked it up and loved the political articles!"
1,unfair subscription practice,"I love GQ magazine. However, Amazon, or the subscription service that it uses, engages in what I believe to be an unfair and dishonest practice. When I purchased my subscription, I was informed that I would not receive my first issue for over two months. However, I was sent an issue after only two weeks. But this issue was over six weeks old and I had already purchased it. Then, a week later, I received another past issue that I had also already purchased off the newstand. In my opinion, this practice is meant to move old ""dead"" issues and is a dishonest method of attempting to fulfill Amazon's obligation to new subcribers. And, as I said, when the purchase of a subscription is made, new sbuscribers are told that new issues will not be sent for two months. As a result, unnecessary newstand purchases could be made in reliance on this information."
1,What a joke,"I knew that this magazine was had gone down hill over the past few years, but WOW. I completely expected it to be 75% full of shallow garbage, crap fashion, and stuff the average 99% can't purchase, but cmon. 30 pages of ads before reaching the letter from the editor? I thought there would be SOME decent articles in here, but all of the writers green, inexperienced, lazy and ignorant. After reading through 3 issues, I canceled**. If you want a REAL men's magazine, try Maxim (can't believe I am saying that).**By canceled, I mean processed a request through Amazon. Seller sent an automated message back ""cannot be processed at this time"". Not worth the grief of fighting it for 9 dollars though..."
3,"Offers great fashion, style advice","GQ is excellent in offering fashion and styles advice that is easily understood and tangible. The advice is reinforced with photos to clearer understanding.Pros- Fashion, and Style advice- Occasionally offers great feature articles- Magazine comes shrinkwrapped so its not damaged by the post officeCons- Small font size- Splits feature articles, I need to skip to the back to finish reading articles- Full of ads"
3,became too vulgar,"Enjoyed it for a while, but unsubscribed when it became too raunchy - started to try to compete with Maxim on the cover and image spreads."
4,The Best Overall Golf Magazine,"I read both Golf & Golf Digest for years [I should practice & play more and read less about golf...] :-) But, in recent years, Golf Digest has strayed far from what I want in a golf magazine - three examples: GD put in a fashion column [nobody I golf with has ever discussed golf clothing or styles!]; GD added a smarmy gossip column [trying to compete with the tabloids?]; GD no longer objectively reviews golf equipment [they now offer a ""hot list"" which amazingly enough coincides with their big advertisers]. Golf magazine has avoided these stupidities PLUS it has the spice of David Feherty's column - despite the fact that it was cut in half a couple years back. Golf is now clearly superior to Golf Digest."
2,Nice illustrations for lessons,"I really enjoy how they illustrate and break down their lessons into different playing abilities. Even though they break down the lessons into breaking 80, 90, 100, straight hitter looking for power or power hitter looking for accuracy, they are all very helpful. No matter what your playing ability, I think any golfer can take away a little bit of advice from the playing lessons. Unfortunately, Golf Magazine seems to be a little weak on their travel side lately though; not really focusing on that perhaps due to the downturn in travel in recent months. I wish they would focus on that a little more like some other magazines such as T&L golf or The Golfer."
1,Where's my magazine?,I have not received an issue as yet. Could you check to see if the order went through?
1,dont know because they havent sent it,Where is the notification or magazine< It has been almost 2 months in 2 days?
1,Golf Mag,The magazine is fine. Waiting for your first issue can take up to 2 months. Not a fan of waiting that long for anything.
1,Ordered over a month ago. Have not received yet.,"I ordered Golf Digest through Amazon on 4/29/09. Received a request to write a review today, but we haven't received the magazine yet. I have to give it the lowest rating because we haven't seen it."
1,When is my magazine coming?,I have ordered this magazine for more than 7 weeks and I still haven't received the first copy. What takes it so long???
4,Great for Golfers,I bought a subscription of GOLF for my father for his birthday. He loves it! He wants another year's subscription for every birthday!
1,Dupped by Amazon.com,I received a $10.00 coupon towards a magazine subscription. I noticed a years subscription to Golf Magazine on Amazon's site. I went thru the whole process was approved and then 2 days later it was cancelled. WTF Amazon?
2,confusing,The manual was not of much help... I still dont know how to calibrate the EC readerI think I am going ti stick with the individual testers for each concept
2,There's so much missing,"Although I'm very fond of all the music in the movie, and this isn't necessarily a bad CD, it could be a lot better. It lacks many of the live performances as well as many of songs featured in snippets in the background thoughout the movie. This disc does not contain even half of the music featured in the movie."
2,Tons Of Interludes & Condensed Songs,"I'ma break it down like this:Nine interludes.Primo's X-Ecution is available on the X-Ecutioners Built From Scratch. If you don't own it buy it now.Re-Animator, Invasion Of The Octopus People, Cut Transmitter & My Style are on the Altered Beats compilation in their original form. If you can find it pick it up. These songs are condensed down on the Scratch OST, each losing at least a minute of material.Only three live tracks at about a minute apiece. DJ Krush's was the only one I really liked.So after all that you're left with six filler tracks, although Rockit 2.002 and Crazy 2 Crazy were alright."
2,"eh, I wouldn't buy it again","Just got my first issue of this magazine and I'm not impressed. A lot of articles about ""advice"" that most parents would consider common sense. Maybe it was just a bad issue, but I don't plan to renew."
5,Easy and Affordable Crafts,We enjoy Family Fun there are plenty of fun and affordable crafts and dinner ideas. The best part of it is you will have most of the items at your house already! I
4,Good craft ideas for children,A lot of this magazine is craft activities. MOst of them are easy and use things you have which is nice.
4,Family Fun,Nice magazine. I have two daughters that are 18 months and 3 years and we find it has many good ideas.
2,Buy Wondertime Instead,"I bought a subscription to Wondertime and Family Fun. I prefer Wondertime HANDS DOWN. I find that I read articles in Wondertime even when I initially think they subject doesn't interest me. On the other hand, I find I can't stand to read articles in Family Fun even when the subject matter interests me. I find the layout extremely busy, almost like I'm looking at a bunch of advertisements crammed together on the pages, when really it's the articles. It has some okay ideas, but also some pretty stupid ones (one that comes to mind is a suggestion for how to handle kids' frustration at the supermarket...one suggestion was to divide up in two groups and give each group one half of the list then race throught the supermarket and see who finishes first... I'd like to be in the supermarket with people doing THAT). If you're looking for a magazine about activities to do with kids and also insightful articles about a variety of subjects, I recommend Wondertime NOT Family Fun."
1,Poor Delivery and Low Customer Satisfaction,"I have enjoyed reading Family Fun Magazine, but unfortunately have only received 2 issues. I have not received any further magazines and am completely disappointed in the service. I will not order another magazine from Amazon because of this poor service. I tried to get a refund and have only gotten the run around."
2,Pay to bring advertising to your house,We signed up for this magazine since it came as a $5 for a whole year of issues. After receiving the first few issues we can definitely say we wont be resubscribing. The magazine is about 80% ads and even most of the articles are ads. We are not happy that we had to pay any money for the postman to bring us all of this advertising with the Disney name on it.
3,The Magazine Diva says.......,"This magazine is a lot of fun, with simple ideas and easy to follow instructions. It caters to a young family, those with children ages 3 - 11 will benefit the most. My most favorable comment is the attitude Family Fun projects, it is always fun and upbeat."
3,They sent me the LARGE toddler liners not the BABY liners in the description!,"The imse vimse liners are fine, they are a bit rough but it does not seem to bother my daughter, though she is admittedly thick-skinned. The upside is that you can wash the ones that have just been peed on at least once right along with the diapers and reuse them, plus they are much softer after the wash. However, I ordered these liners and they did not send me 200 of the baby sized liners as described, instead they sent me 100 of the toddler size which are far, far too big for my purposes and, alas, not quite big enough to simply cut in half so I ended up trimming off and wasting about 1/3 of the liner. Annoying. Amazon was moderately helpful and the dispute was resolved to my liking after I bullied them into simply refunding me half of my money since they sent me only half of the liners that I ordered."
2,"Sufficent but there are softer, nicer inserts out there","I have used any number of diaper inserts in my life (I use mostly Bum Genius and Fuzzin Bunz diapers). I use them not only to collect the poo, but also so that I can use serious diaper creams like Desitin on my daughter's diaper-rash-prone bumbum. I bought these instead of my regular brand because they were (slightly) cheaper. What a disappointment! Yes, they will probably be just as effective at keeping poo and medicine off of the diapers, but they are so rough and rigid that I truly worried that putting them against my daughter's skin might rub her diaper-rash raw again. Yuck! I tried them a couple of times, and she actually didn't seem to mind (I will admit), but I just didn't feel good about using them. There are much softer, nicer brands out there for nearly the same price. Don't settle for these."
1,way too rough!,these liners are waaaaay too rough in comparison to others on the market. i won't even use them. buy a different brand!
3,Flushable Liners,"These flushable liners are stiffer/scratcher than the previous type of liners I have purchased. Although they do the same thing as the more pliable liners, I don't think it would be very comfrotable to wear....just glad I am not the one having to wear it!"
3,Not my favaorite liner,"I have been trying to find a liner that doesn't bunch too badly, fits the Bum Genius 3.0 one size diaper well and doesn't irritate my child's skin. These only fit one of these requirements (the last one). The bunch pretty badly on my active 16 month old and have to be folded or cut to fit the diapers we use. This last detail seems to be an issue with all of the liners I have tried except the Kushies. All of the liners I have tried seem to bunch too so this may be a lost cause. It is curious to me why the manufacturers make liners that do not seem to fit the diapers and don't offer details on how they see them being used. Maybe someday..."
3,Chafed in the crotch,"I used these for a long time and they're big and effective, but since they're rectangular they have to fold in on themselves. This creates an area where there is a lot more liner than there should be. It periodically caused chafing and this last time I just quite using them."
3,Only good for solid solids,"These look like dryer sheets. Not good for soft or running stools, only solids. Has no absorption, but still useful. Makes clean up faster."
4,cloth diaper helpers,"I'm glad we have these but sometimes we forget cause she only poops once a day, if that. So if you put them in every diaper it can be somewhat wasteful. Though we do wash ours once and reuse them. But for the soiled cloth diapers they can be handy. I think once she's older and into more solids it will be better."
4,Imse Vimse Flushable Liners,"We got these liners for my daughter's cloth diapers. They make clean up super easy, and also help to keep her diaper cream off the diapers. They are rather large (and sometimes stick out the sides of her diaper), but that just means it gives you great coverage. They also seem a little stiff, but she doesn't seem to mind. We wash the ""pee only"" ones, and once washed, they are a little softer."
4,Great buy.,"We use these as poop catchers at daycare. They are nicely sized, and will hold up to 2-3 washes if no pooping occurs. My little one only attends daycare 2-3 days a week, so our first package lasted us about 7 months. They are well worth a little bit higher price. The only drawback is that they are not as soft as some of the other brands, but they caused no irritation on the bum."
1,no good,when i told my husband we were going to use cloth diapers he was so concerned about the poop. so i looked into liners hoping to alleviate his worries. i read so many reviews i drove myself crazy. i ended up buying these because they costed less and you could wash them.they are horrible. they are so rough and scratchy. these liners gave my little one a horrible rash. they do get softer as your little one pees in them and sweats. you can actually wash them and reuse them.i just dont feel like these are worth giving my little a rash. thankfully my husband realized cloth is really no different then disposables and poop is not an issue.i would not buy them again and i have so many left that are going to waste.
3,"fine, but rip easily","they were fine, they work good. but the perforations are not real easy to tear to separate them, so it's easy to rip the liners themselves."
3,Baby Allergic,After using this liner our son broke out in a diaper rash. We are new to cloth diapering and loving it. The functional aspect of the liner is as advertised. Kushies and Nappies work better for us. Kushies to provide a barrier between the diaper and diaper rash cream and Nappies due to their soft feel. Wish IV liners worked out for us.
2,"Great idea, but didn't work for us","Our son has special needs and will need to be in diapers longer, so we went ahead and invested in some good cloth diapers. He only voids once a day but it is very messy. We thought these liners would help keep the diaper somewhat cleaner and easier to rinse, but the liner just created a shoot for the poop to come out of the leg holes! Yuck!Since we know when he is going to do it, (he takes medicine for it and we have it timed out) we either put a paper (decomposable) diaper on him and toss it, or watch him closely so that we catch it right after it happens so there is less mess.I would only recommend this product for kids who have very solid stool. Our child's is very loose and the product does not work for him. I will say that we washed some of them with the diapers and it seems to more absorbent and less stiff after its washed."
5,Long-lasting liners - perfect,"I bought these for use with cloth G-Diapers and they're super effective, even with breast-milk poop. The poop stays on top of the liner, which you just remove and flush. Wet liners can even be washed with your diapers several times before needing to be thrown out."
1,"rough, bad perforations, tear","I think my heading says it all.....these liners are rough, they feel like sandpaper on hands let alone my baby' s bottom. The perforations are barely visible and when you pull on the roll, the liner will tear. I am returning these."
3,mehh,"I bought these liners to help make cleanup easier, my son was destroying his cloth diapers. They did an excellent job of blocking the poop and seem to flush just fine. But like other reviewers said, these liners are a little rough...but don't seem to bother my son. I ultimately just stopped using them, they were more of a hassle for me to use them. And my husband insisted that our son hated the way they felt."
1,Might as well use sandpaper,The pros: It will keep the poop off your baby's butt and diaper.The cons:1)There is no way I would put that next to my child's skin. Go to your laundry supplies and pull out a fabric softer sheet. That's what if feels like. Can you imagine wearing that all day?2) It does NOT keep the wetness away from the skin. Not even a little bit.I think I'm going to soak my purchase in liquid fabric softner and use them in the dryer.I don't know if all liners are like this as this is the first one I tried. I've decided to use the fleece liners instead as they will keep the wetness away from the skin.
1,POOR QUALITY,"I got these to try and it was 2.00 less than my regular nappy liners brand, well ""what is cheap is not worth"" I use them on my daughters cloth diapers, and they break easily, move around, basically don't do the job!!! DONT BUY!!!!!"
2,Not the best ...,"I bought these liners because they were less expensive than others. I gave them two stars for a few different reasons.My daughter has very sensitive skin and I need to use diaper cream on her every time I change her. Even using two sheets, folded, the paste still leaks through to the diaper sometimes. A big bummer when using cloth diapers as you have to spend extra time scrubbing to get the paste out.The price seems cheaper than the others - 200 sheets for the same price as 100 sheets - but I end up using two at a time. So it really evens out in the end."
1,not good,"These liners are not good! I bought these specifically to protect our baby's cloth diapers when he has to use heavy-duty diaper cream- they do not do the job well. They are rough, tend to bunch up, and tear easily, resulting in diaper cream all over the diapers. Great. We had another brand before this (I can't remember which brand) and they were much, much better. I strongly recommend buying a different brand."
2,Rough and Cause a Rash,"These liners are a good size, but they are really rough and my son now gets rashes when I use them. On the plus side, they can be washed and reused and are more soft after washing, but I would prefer a product that is soft from the start. I like the bumkins liners much better."
2,Not the best liner,"I bought this liner because it was the only one available on amazon at the time. It is my least favorite liner I've tried. It was too wide for the diapers so it has to be folded to fit, and its really thin and scratchier than others. I will say that so far it hasnt broken on me, so its held up as far as usefulness goes, but its an annoyance to put in."
4,IT's great just doesn't hold the big blow outs!,"I love this product the only unfortunate side to this diaper liner is that it doesn't hold in the blowouts, if your baby has seriously liquidy number twos and it's kind of a lot, it'll seep right through the diaper liner, but if it isn't too much, or it's more solid than liquid, then you should be fine, that's why I give this diaper liner 4 stars, it sure is a help, so long as my baby doesn't have diarrhea or just a lot to offer that night if you know what I mean lol"
2,I wouldn't recommend them.,They are stiff. They do the job but I have used other ones I like much better. Also they tend to tear when they get wet were the other ones wouldn't. I wouldn't recommend them.
2,Too rough,"Not a fan of these. They're very rough and give my baby redness, so we're stuck with 175 liners we don't know what to do with. Would have preferred if like other companies they sold them as 100, so I could have decided and saved money. They do the job they're supposed to do but at the cost of hurting my little one's bum, so no go."
2,Caused skin to peel,"These diaper liners were rough and after using for a whole days worth of diapering, my little one's skin started peeling. We looked at all the usual suspects: diet, cloth diaper too tight, amonia burn, etc. but it was none of those and the skin peeling stopped two days after I discontinued use. Sadly, we can't use the rest and found them to be a waste of money."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"This product picture IS NOT ACCURATE from what you recieve from the company. You only get half of a package and it comes wrapped in plastic wrap with no label or product information. The company also charges $6.99 for shipping, but pays $3.85 in postage (priority mail stamp on envelop). That cost is more than the product, and cleary not worth it given the shotty presentation."
1,Not Soft At All,Feel quite rough. I am afraid my baby will be very uncomfortable with these. Will be sticking with Viscose Biodegradable/ Flushable Liners for Dispoable or Cloth Diaper- BubuBibi from now on. Their incredibly soft.
2,Not practical with Bumgenious cloth diapers,The individual sheets are too big and we need to cut them in half in order to use them with the Bumgenious cloth diapers.
4,"Very Wide, Confusing Description","These liners are very wide, but will be perfect with my daughter gets a little wider herself. They are very thin, so the wideness isn't really a problem.I was slightly confused by the description for this item. You are buying 200 liners total. These are NOT rolls of 200 liners. There are 2 rolls, 100 liners each."
1,Too Rough,"I really didn't like these liners. I bought them because I read some good reviews, but they felt so rough, almost like paper towels. I ended up ordering more Bummis Bio-Soft liners, because the Imse Vimse ones just felt so hard and rough against my poor boy's bottom."
5,Excellent family board game!,"This is one of the most highly recommended board game I've ever played since childhood. Now I brought this to my little kids and they love it. The game is interesting, exciting and the most important of all, it's the kind of game that amuse the adults as well. But be careful, make sure you have enough time to play -- you can hardly stop once started."
4,"Monopoly, an old family favorite",I just bought Monopoly as a family activity to play with our TV and computer addicted soon to be teenager. I remember how much fun this game was years ago. We would pull it out whenever we had friends over or wanted some diversion. There is nothing like this old family favorite.
4,A Classic,What can I say its Monopoly A classic game. Good for those days when theres nothing to do also good for teaching Children about money and business.
5,Great game,"Awesome game. Would be more fun if the family was not so competitive but other than that, game is great. Just can get very long."
3,Monopoly- Who hasn't played this game???,"Monopoly is part of EVERY household I have ever visited! Although the game may take up to 3 hours or more (which sometimes leads to abandoning the current game for bedtime or chores) it is pretty entertaining. Move around the board buying up properties in an attempt to collect all properties of as many color groups as you can, on which you can build homes and hotels and rake in your opponents cash when they happen to unluckily land on your turf! Game ends when all other players are out of cash!"
3,It's Ok,This monolpoly is good it has new peices but as in all the other monolpoly the game never ends and i usually get board and put it away before the game even ends!
5,Nice Features But Did Not Like Quad-Fold Board,"The Deluxe edition has all of the great features of original monopoly plus some great upgrades. I loved the gold-toned token pieces and the wood houses and hotels. The Chance and Community Chest cards are in color and durable. The money is about the same. The deed holder is convenient but made of plastic. The biggest dislike I had is the quad-fold game board which is a pain to unfurl and not very attractive. It also makes the board flimsy. I would have like the bi-fold in the original monopoly. Get the game as I did on sale (buy one, get one free.)"
4,Ryan's Monopoly Review,"I like Monopoly a lot. It introduces you to the world of money and spending. It is fun becasue it is a long-lasting game. I once was playing with it and the game went on for a week. (We still didn't finish it, we just gave up!) You should buy Monopoly, 'cause it's loads of fun!"
2,One of many early Santana recordings,"This is one of a bazillion CD's featuring early Santana work.There are no liner notes on the CD, so it is difficult to know the origin. It is probably recorded before the first Santana album was released.It is 54 minutes long, and has a note on the covers that it is 2 LP's in one (two very short LP's).The sound quality is poor, like it was taped on home equipment. There is not audience noise, so it was probably recorded in a studio, or more likely someone's home studio or garage. It has a wierd quality, like something is missing.Like most of the early Santana music, it is not that great. It is long, drawn out performances of some of the oldest Santana numbers, like Jingo.There are a ton of these type of Santana CD's out there. I still haven't heard one that is great. There are some that are passable."
4,"Different albums, but both satisfying","Sports is unquestionably the News' breakout album. Small World seems to get dissed a lot, but I found it to be a solid effort. The title track(s) have a good groove, with tasty Tower of Power horn hooks, and Part II has Stan Getz soloing in one of his last performances before he died! Perfect World is good, Slammin' cooks, and World to Me is as good a ballad as Huey ever recorded. Is Bobo Tempo bad? Yeah that track is lame. But the rest is very good stuff."
2,Im being generous with this rating,"As a die hard HLN fan, I was eagerly awaiting the Fore follow up Small World back in 88'. Unfortunantly, I was dissapointed to say the least. Songs like ""Old Antones"" and ""Bobo Tempo"" made my stomach do things its not supposed to do. Only songs like ""Perfect World"" ""Gimme the Keys"" and ""World to Me"" saved this cd from being turned into a drink coaster or clock. Everyband has their one bad record, and this one was definantly it. Luckily the boys redeemed themselves nicely with the next release Hard at Play. Small World? More like Small Effort."
3,Got Some Laughs,"It's three shows. The first one focuses on love and romance, and was never aired, and was hosted by a guy I've never seen in the on-air show. The Love & Marriage DVD is funnier. The other two episodes were $100,000 shows hosted by Daisy Fuentes and John Fugelsang. I kept being distracted by their attempts to put Daisy Fuentes in sexy attire that somehow never fit her right, and her hair would never stay in place. Overall the shows are good for a few laughs, but not the best DVD."
2,Not very good at all!,"This disk is not worth the money. Does not have closed captioning as promised. Not a very good quality selection of clips. Hosts did not impress me. AFV, being one of the most successful programs ever, simply should be doing a much better job in composing its DVDs. This is my first negative review."
4,BETTER IF NOT ONE TOPIC,IM VERY USED TO AFV ON TV. THIS DVD DEALS WITH ONE SPECIFIC TOPIC AND STAYS WITH IT. I ALSO ONT THINK D.L. HUGHLEY WAS A GOOD HOST CHOICE FOR THIS SHOW. ITS ALMOST AMAZING TO SEE THE FUNNY THINGS PEOPLE REALLY DO. AND ACTUALLY WIN $100000 FOR DOING IT. MY FAMILIES DONE SOME PRETTY FUNNY STUFF WHO KNOWS MABYBE WORTHY OF $100000????? IF YOU REALLY LIKE AFV I SAY GET A BOX SET INSTEAD OF THIS SINGLE DVD. ITS WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN.
3,Not for serious classical music lovers,"This is a fine relaxation CD for someone who is not that into classical music. But for those looking for something special, this is not it. I like to buy transcriptions, with works done by instruments different than originally intended, because they can bring something new to the listening of a familiar work. I think the problem here is that the flute, even in the hands of an expert, cannot carry the melodic line as well as an orchestral section can. Many of the pieces sounded flat -- missing the texture of the original orchestration."
5,Fine handbook.,"Here is the everything you want to know about America's most charming songbirds.Their taxonomy and distribution, food and feeding habits, calls and songs (males and females both sing, unlike most species), behavior, breeding and development, and relations with humans (excellent, you will be happy to learn), are comprehensively but succinctly covered, in a highly readable narrative with a generous selection of excellent photos.Professor Ritchison's work is highly recommended for libraries and students, and a fine gift for that birdwatcher.(The ""score"" rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not ""score"" books.)"
3,"An impressive, informative guide","I think that this guide--Northern Cardinal--is a gratifying and educational tool to the natural history of the northern cardinal. It was published in 1997 and written by ornithologist Gary Ritchison. The guide is 122 pages and consists of 11 chapters. The color photos are pleasing and revealing. Examples of topics that are discussed are taxonomy and distribution, food and feeding habits, vocal behavior, the breeding season, the nonbreeding period, and relations with humans. Behavioral aspects of the northern cardinal that I find to be especially fascinating are the ability of both sexes to sing and the regional dialects that they display throughout their geographical range. Northern cardinals are interesting, pretty birds that I enjoy observing and attracting with birdfeeders and birdbaths. Actually, I rate this guide 3.5 stars--it is thorough and impressive."
4,The book and the disk are great!,"It is really a good book on inverse problems. And it is cool that they give you a disk with matlab functions, and the date for the examples. But I think that book is focus on the wrong things: some of the chapters could be removed, and some new chapters could be added."
4,Fabo,This was a very useful book when I was visiting Quebec City this summer. Even 2007 it was not out of date. Tip - look for previous years of Fodor's - you don't need the latest version.
3,you get what's pictured,"Just figeured if they used the term ""replacement"" you would get a replacement cartridge. A better description would be ""General filters 1A-25A fuel oil filter Assembly"" or complete with filter? You get the housing with filter already installed."
3,Tribe,"This cd should only be for diehard tribe fans for the few unreleased tracks and remixes.Any fan who has never gotten into ATQ should pick up anthology, as it features more of their better songs. Its sort of a teaser tho,because Peoples instinctive travels, low end theory, and midnight marauders are all perfect albums. If you have the money buy all three of those. Even anthology doesnt have enuff room to cover all of their songs. They would need atleast 3 discs to cover the greatness ATQ has made. Those 3 albums are simply the some of the best hip hop albums ever made. Instead of forkin out 15 bucks for a greatest hits album, look for their first 3 at reasonable prices, because one tribe cd would just be cheating yourself"
3,Maestro Classico,"When compared with the ample catalogue of WWII-Early 50's recordings, most of these performances seem less than satisfactory. The sound is generally brittle and sharp; I found it actually caused me discomfort to listen to Schubert's 8th symphony. In other places the sound is more acceptable, but the lower end still remains indistinct. Valuable as a historical document and if you REALLY like Furtwangler."
5,Possibly the best Heyer!,"I'm afraid bookjunkie said everything so perfectly and eloquently I have very little to add and yet I must add my voice to those who claim this as their favorite Heyer. In Frederica, you have an exquisite heroine - intelligent, humorous, well-looking but not a diamond, kind, and above all totally believable as a woman who could turn the world of an accomplished, arrogant, self-centered rake upside down. Heyer manages beautifully to make our hero, Alverstoke, all those things and yet absolutely marvelous at the same time. As usual, Heyer's secondary characters are perfection - interesting and amusing and so believable you feel she must know these people. This book is a must read for any regency fan - it is one of the best! An added bonus is that it hardly matters how much you pay for it - I don't think I could ever get tired of reading this book; I probably re-read Frederica twice a year: it never loses it's charm."
5,Author and Book 5 Stars- Kindle 1 Star for Price Gouging,"Other reviewers will do full justice to Georgette Heyer's charming books. Many of us are happy to have found a source for her writing once again. BUT! I bought ""Frederica"" for $1.99 Sept. 2011. I bought other Heyer books at the same price afterward, or at very similar prices. Then prices crept upwards. Now Amazon's Kindle is indulging in price gouging now that they've caught onto the fact that this author is a winner. I'm returning to buying used physical copies and not handing Amazon and Kindle some $8. or more for convenience."
3,I wouldn't compare this author to Jane Austen,"because, it is not even close. Austen's books are full of romance, tension and passion. This book is OK for summer reading on the beach. Sorry, only 3 stars."
5,Main characters sparkle,I loved it. The dialogue was great as usual. The family lives depicted were so real and accurate. I could just feel I was there in the book. It's hard to pick which is my favorite Heyer novel anymore. It is sort of predictable but there are a few twists and turns. I love how simple and yet complex each story is. The wit and sparkle between the main characters is always so stunning. Don't I wish I could think of replies like this.
4,Classic Regency,"Georgette Heyer is the goddess of regency. I have read several of her books 20+ times, this is one of them. It contains humor galore. A light and easy romp by a skilled author. No sappy ""Barbara Cartland"" style drivel here. Heyer's characters in Fredrica are heartwarming and real."
2,A Once Great Brand,"When I graduated college, I went to the local department store and purchased a suit and a pair of Rockport wingtips. Those shoes were comfortable and lasted me a very long time. Ten years later, I think I have worn my last pair of Rockports. Sadly, the quality is not there any longer though the comfort is. Rockport (a Reebok company now) has replaced the Vibram outsoles with a foam outsole that wears out in weeks and squeaks like those toddler squeaky shoes that are so cute . . . on a toddler. The squeak is embarassing and I can't spend $75 every month. I have now moved on to a Rockport imitator. Thankfully there are several in the department stores. Brands to consider: Croft & Barrow, Deer Stag, and Dexter."
3,This game is pretty good,Clue is a good family game. We've been playing it for years. It is very educational for the children. I recommend everyone to buy this.
5,The Classic Mystery Game for the Whole Family!,"Miss Scarlet in the Library with the revolver! I played this game with my cousin starting when I was six until I was sixteen, and we never got tired of it. If you like a challenge, this is the game for you. The concept is so simple. The murder, the room, and the murder weapon are chosen at random and placed in a secret envelope and then each player becomes a detective. The atmosphere can be tense as you must suspect everone. I would reccomend this game to mystery lovers both young and old."
4,clue rules,"Me and friends play this for hours!! We always love finding out who did the murder. This is a good game for family gatherings, and when you're bored. This is a great holiday present. I would buy the new DVD one too. The only bad thing is little kids can't play because you have to know how to read and also you need at least 3 players to play. But overall it's a very good game. I don't recommend it for kids under 5."
4,Fun game for adults and kids,Not sure what the new version will be like. We made sure to get the older version before they all disappeared. My eight year old loves to play it. It is a game we can play with her and enjoy. I like the thinking involved. There is strategy in the way you narrow down possibilities to figure out who to accuse. The pieces are small replicas of the character and murder weapons and are durable.
5,This toy is great!,This toy teachs children to draw conclusions and how to use the process of elimination.Plus they have fun doing it!
4,Junior Holmes,"Can you use deductive logic to eliminate options and determine the three elements of the crime. A great and colorful game which is a classic, made better by new editions such as the simpsons."
3,"Over rated, imo","It's not that I haven't had fun playing this game, it's just that it really isn't fun without the right number of people playing. There is too much dependance on getting lucky and if the skill level between playes is too great, it's a cake walk for the more logical thinkers.I also don't think this is the kind of game you can keep playing over and over like scrabble, boggle, or any number of card games that all have a lot more variance in play.I'm not totally knocking ""Clue"", but it's one of those games that gets tiring after a few times of playing it."
4,Don't be Clue -less,"This is a fun puzzle game in which players eliminate one room,one weapon and one suspect,after another to become the first to guess who is the killer."
5,"Good family fun, teaches logic & deduction","We enjoy this game, and it is good for teaching our 9 yr old to use reasoning & deduction. It is still entertaining to us, as adults, also. Good addition to the game cabinet. Glad we bought it."
4,Fun with logic,Great way to learn about logical deduction. Think the game is too easy? Play it *without* the deduction sheets (or whatever it is they're called).
3,Kids don't get it,"I grew up playing htis game and just loved it so naturally I thought my kids would love this game too. We have played it once. They have no desire to play it again. ANd, my kids in general so like board games."
3,"Believe it or not, I never had played Clue....","even as a kid, I never played this game. I got it for my son's 7th birthday, as we have Clue Jr. and he enjoys that very much. I don't know, maybe this game will grow on me more, but I actually like Clue Jr. better, I think it is more fun. I know this is a classic game, but the game play just seemed odd to me. It does get kids thinking about strategy and makes them have to remember details, which is why I rated it high for educational. Overall, this won't be one of the go-to games on our shelf, though, as we have many, many more interesting games than this."
3,I think Clue is O.K.,"I did not like Clue that muh , because its kinda boring once you play it at least 6 times or more."
2,"elastic not sufficiently big, tight on the calf.","The product is great for someone with very skinny legs. I thought I was buying queen size and maybe that was the problem, it was not."
2,product is ok,"The product is ok. I have not worn them yet , but they are very sheer and I have a feeling they are going to run easily. My biggest issue is that the knee highs are packaged in a small envelope and they are shipped in a huge box. If it was shipped in another envelope instead of the box the company could have charge the cost of shipping a letter!! Instead you will pay more for shipping than for the cost of the product."
2,"Seriously, one pair?","I haven't worn these yet, but it seems that they will serve their purpose. My only gripe is that the product package doesn't indicate how many pairs you are purchasing. I paid more for shipping than I did for the product. Had I known there was only one pair, I would have passed."
3,they are alright,i ordred two of these one was a tan color and one was nude color and they seemed alright the opening for the feet were a little small which was a surprise since i am a petite person 5'6 and 110 lbs. I guess my feet are just a little bigger then i thought lol other wise they were comfortable i never did use them never needed them yet i just tryed them on to make sure they fit right beware tho they do stretch easy and if you are not careful you will leave those Runners or whatever they are called. I did get one small one in the tan ones on theback side near the ankel area but hard to notice if you are not up close to it and if someone is on their hands and knees looking at my ankle i am sure i would kick them in the head lol
5,"GEORGE SHEARING ""THE SHEARING TOUCH""","I bought this CD thru Amazon.. unfortuneately I had not delved thourghly enough into the reviews. What I received was NOT the Capitol recording of ""The Shearing Touch""...but a facsimile.I am told that that LP is unfortuneately, out of print!"
5,You might as well just quit your job before buying it,"Unreal Tournament is, in my opinion, the 2nd best First Person Shooter game created so far, 1st being Half Life. There was a lot of hype surrounding this but, unlike Quake 3, it lives up to the hype. It succedes in all the places Quake 3 fails - fun weapons, interesting boards and a very intelligent AI system on the bots (just try beating the Godlike setting). And I think it even blows away Quake 3 graphics-wise, too. My only pet peeve with the game is the load time!! I have a 733 MHZ computer and it takes FOREVER. But it's still worth the wait."
4,Great Game,"For those who aren't able to play online, the game is horrible. But for those who can play it online, it is the best FPS EVER!! So it only looses 1 star for non-internet capable gamers."
4,THIS GAME ROCKS,This game is very fun to play. And is very easy to configure. I have not found a video card that would not play it. The graphics where way ahead of everything at the time of its release. If you want to play Unreal Tournament 2003 but your computer is not capable of playing it. This game is for you. It’s almost the same as 2003. 2003 just has better graphics and few different guns. I have both and I play this one more than the other because over all it was better made. It is much simpler to configure. Game play is smoother and weapons fire is more precise. This game will always be one of my favorite games. It most definitely was the game of the year.
3,Fun or Bordum???,"Unreal Tournament is a fun game in the many ways that you can play the game... (e.g. capture the flag, assualt, deathmatch, team deathmatch, last man standing etc) Some problems are that after you play it about 10 times it starts to get boring and Unreal has one of the worst online multiplaying games i have ever seen... The worst thing though is the guns, for example when you use a gun like the sniper it really ... cause u kill every1 in 1 shot same with the rocket launcher, redeemer, chainsaw, enforcers... plus the a.i.'s are horrible even when u put the skill level up all the way. This is a good game if you like to sit around and do practically nothing cept to click a button."
3,Now It's Just Another Shooter,"I don't meant to criticize the game. It has neat graphics, interesting environment, and fast-paced action. I have just outgrown this genre. When I was younger, I could still play ""Doom"" for hours. This game is far more advanced than ""Doom."" But to every season there is a turn, to every age its own."
1,Who gives this five stars?,This is q3a all over again. Once again we have a 3d shooter with good graphics but it just moves too fast. I can't keep up with anything in this game. I hate it. There is too much work for it to be fun.
5,the best action game for the money,DO not waste your money on any other game-get unreal tournament.You will need to be pryed away from the keyboard it is so addicting-
5,U.T.G.O.T.Y.E.,"This has to be one of the greatest games ever made. Its' been out for over 2 years but I still play it often if not every day. The team features such as capture the flag or assault are great for multiplayer gaming. There's also tons of mods out for the game, most of which are free. Some even allow you to have a Half-Life type of game with different units. The graphics are superb, the game runs smooth even on older systems (PIII 500mhz, 64mb Ram, 8mb ATi Rage Pro). It suports virtually all type of hardware configurations and has reasonable low system requirenments. U.T. has caught on and is now available on virtually every console. (UT Championship is coming soon for X-Box.) If you never played U.T., you don't know what your missing."
5,Unreal Tournament Kicks F&$^(#@ A%$,I loved Unreal Tournament and now Game of the Year is out. They could not make a better game. The new maps and weapons are great. Has to be the best game I have played.
2,OK,Ok game. Tribes to is better. I was playing this game and i took out a gun and it was such a bootleg tribes 2 i had to pause the came yjust to pee. And dont play multiplayer 2 much lag
5,Definitely my favorite shooter,"When I was younger, I played Wolfenstein and Doom, beat them, thought they were ok. Got a little older, played demos of the Quake games, thought they weren't worth buying. Then I saw a copy of UT, the Game of the Year edition, for a lil bit in a store. I figured since it was a fairly popular game and was being sold inexpesively, I might as well buy it.I was completely blown away (by the redeemer ;) ). While Deathmatch is pretty boring to me (the main reason I didn't like other shooters), game types like Capture the Flag, Assault, Domination, etc. that add some strategy to the game really made this game worth the money I spent on it and the many, many hours I spent playing it. The AI was actually challenging (most of the time), which I'm not used to seeing in very many games. Plus, playing against human players online is a hell of a lot of fun. Whether you're a fan of FPS games or not, this game is definitely worth it."
4,Great for focusing skills,I sometimes work with children who have difficulty focusing and competing tasks in their entirety. This game requires focusing. These skills then carry over into other areas. Great toy for strengthening focusing skills.
3,Simon trickster,Fun toy even for grown-ups! It's a lot smaller than the original simon but it does its work. Good present for kids over 5 years old.
4,Bought this for my 7 year old niece,I bought this as a belated birthday present for my niece and from what I understand from my sister (cause they live in a different state) I think she like it a lot and uses it often. Oh the other thing is my niece needed some memory help techniques and my sister said this type of game was recommended to her by the teacher.
4,A view from the public,"This Trivia game for kids is educational, cheap, and kids love it!! It teaches kids their gameshow trivia, while making them beleive that they are smarter than they thought."
1,"Very, Very, Extremely EASY!!!","I have this game and it is so bad! I was 8 years old when I got it, and I wanted my mom to not ask me the questions with the multiple choices! The multiple choices are so easy! I remember one... It was a blue question and it was,""Which fruit has little hairs on it?"" Ding ding ding! You can easily see, without the multiple choices, that the answer is a peach.My mom just came in the room and I told her I was writing this review. She said that this game would be great for a five-year-old. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! The game box says ages 8 and up! Very over-aged.So just buy this game for your five-year-old, okay?"
4,Suitable for non-English speakers,"Often other editions (Genus, Millennium) are too sophisticated, some non-English speakers cannot enjoy. But this is the game even they can enjoy. Not only are the questions easier to answer, but the language used is much simpler. We play it in our English lessons, not to mention in parties!"
4,good fun for all,"We bought this for our kids (then 7 and 5) for Christmas. The 7 year old loves playing it, but the 5 year old finds it frustrating that he doesn't know the answers. We have to play with an adult on each team, and even then it is uneven. I don't like the way they have changed to counters and paper ""wedges"", so we just use ours from our adult game."
1,golf,This product has not been delivered as yet...the down time as to when it was ordered and to when it is forcasted to arrive is much too long. Golf Digest
2,All around,"Golf Digest is the quintessential all around golf magazine. They write about lessons, travel, equipment and golf news. They seem to be a little biased recently with the acquisition of many of today's top golf stars, by not writing anything negative about them or their sponsors, i.e. Tiger and Nike. They are usually right on with their reviews of places to play and I enjoy how they pick one location and focus on it. I.e. Cape Cod, the courses that you can play and other activities that are around the vicinity. I wish they would choose some more exotic locales such as South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and South America though."
2,Hate this!,"I knew it would happen. The first magazine I got had already been on the store shelves for three weeks - and I had already purchased it.So, in essence the subscriptin period is for 11 magazines, not 12, and you know what? It isn't worth trying to get this sorted out."
2,You'll wait 3 months for 1st issue,"Great magazine, great price...but I had no idea it would take 3 months for the 1st issue to arrive. It was a birthday gift for my dad, but now he has to wait 1/4 of a year to start receiving it!!? Just get the subscription directly from the magazine"
3,Golf Digest,"I received TWO editions the same day. Sept & Oct arrived the same day. Tacky, tacky, tacky. This is a monthly. Sure you can probably explain BUT you could also do it right - preferredJoe Grattan"
1,never received it in the mail,"I ordered this magazine 4 months ago, still have not received a copy.just about to contact my credit card company to reverse charges.I have sent 3 emails to amazon to resolve - nothing has happened yet."
4,Golf Magazine,This magazine is for my husband. He enjoys when it is delivered and will read it cover to cover before week's end.
2,Fairly Mediocre!,"A couple of years ago I bought a Ramon Vargas CD in Tijuana that was just magnificent. It what was a live recital performed in Guanajuato for a Cerventino Literature Fair and I was very happy with his renditions of Italian baroque arias and turn of the century Mexican danzas. However, he is simply not made for ranchereas. His voice is montonous - like Placido Domingo, he only knows how to sing ""open"" with lots of vibrato - and lacks any rhythym or pizzaz whatsover. Further, with the proliferation of quality Mexican tenors (Fernando de la Mora, Alberto Angel, Humberto Craviotto, Valente Pastor ...) he is going to have to do a lot better than this to earn my dollar. In fact, I am not exaggerating when I say that even the boys from Mariachi Vargas, Mariachi Cobre or Los Camperos sing these songs better than Ramon. Don't waste your money purchase the original renditions with Jorge Negrete & Pedro Vargas or recent renditions by the tenors I have mentioned."
3,Worth reading,"This book is too strong on salvation by works, but being a product of this publisher the reader can expect it. This book makes you think about some very important issues. From that perspective it becomes a good book."
3,Not very comprehensive,"JD Coleman has attempted to illustrate how the battles around Wonju were the high-water mark for the Chinese, much as Gettysburg was the beginning of the end for the Confederates. There is an interesting account of a task force all but wiped out in what became known as ""massacre valley"" but most of the book has been recounted elsewhere, in greater depth. The author spends a substatial amount of time on the 187th Airborne RCT (his old outfit) and while this is interesting in its detail, the author tends to dwell a little too long on it. Most of these accounts revolve around one or two companies and this gives a disjointed perspective which magnifies things out of proportion to what's going on elsewhere."
5,Amazing!,It's really GOOD and I can't believe it!Also it was very resonable price.I'm fully satisfied with my purchase this book.Wow!
1,"Ordered a month ago, nothing to show for it and who do I talk to?!","Not much to say - I'd have given it NO STARS if I could have. I love the Realage stuff and site, and I love the associated books like ""YOU the Owners Manual"" but as far as this seller goes ... I feel like I've just thrown money out of the car window. I checked whether I had been charged - of course I had - and then 2 days ago I sent an email to the company. I have yet to hear back from them. I ordered a similar item from a different distributor within minutes of placing this order and recieved that book 2 days after I ordered it - same shipping method. Soooo, it appears that I've been taken. I do NOT advise purchasing from this distributor, I think they're just waiting for me to forget that I ordered anything in the first place."
2,Body Polish comment,I only like the feel of the polish when I use it - It has a way too strong smell that is not as nice; nor is it as nice as your lavender polish was - The lavender was the best I have used ever.
3,More of a preserve,I've been hunting for the intensely flavorful creation I found at a roadside stand several years ago. This has a nice flavor but does not have the intense flavor or texture I've been searching for.
3,"""Double Play Compact Disc"" Is Only 40:58 Long","Record albums were shorter back in the old days, but be aware that this CD -- which is labeled as ""Double Play Compact Disc"" and ""Equivalent to Two Albums"" on the front of the booklet -- is only 40 minutes and 58 seconds long (16 songs)."
4,"""A very educational game...""",When I first recieved this game I thought that it was very fun and educational. It could teach you about what it's like to be a parent by having to pay a lot of bills off. It also teaches you if it's smart to buy something or not. A lottery is involved in this game to show you your fate of taking a risk. This game is fun for the whole family with hours and hours of learning fun. It's a great gift for the holidays or someones birthday. It is also very cheap and probrably the best place to buy it would be Amazon.com
4,Classic game retouched,"I had a version of this game when I was a kid. It's lots of fun, and is both simple enough for kids to understand, and entertaining enough for adults. It is a great family game that won't bore parents. However, the new version has wavey spaces that don't suit the eyes as well as the old, simple, 90-degree angled layout."
5,Awesome Law Textbook - Very Useful Out of School as Well,"West's Business Law is amazing for the student of business law. It presents complicated subject matter in a way that can be understood. After reading it, I felt ""everyone should read this book,"" because it applies to so many situations we could face in everyday life. It provides a more in-depth and overall law presentation than most college text books. If you hunger for knowledge of the law (whether you want to be a lawyer or not), you will be filled by the material in West's Business Law. My husband has a business law class right now which uses another textbook and there is no comparison. I only regret that I lost my West's Business Law when I was moving, because it is one textbook I had wanted to keep forever."
3,West's Business Law 10th edition,The book is in good condition. No notes written on any pages or high lighter marked. It's all in complete package.
3,Business Law,"I received the book very fast, but the book was not at all in the condition as described. It was at a very good rating and I would have rated it as acceptable. It had major highlighting and markings, when I was told it had few and the binding is in poor condition, however the book was cheap."
1,Two Books-Never recieved one,I ordered two books from amazon. The first one was lost in transit and I never recieved it plus I wasn't refunded my money. The second one they sold me a book that they actually didn't have in stock. It took them 4 days to figure that out so overall it took me about 6 weeks to get the book I finally needed and it was not through them.
2,Changed the formula!,"Just read the review about the change of ownership! Now I know why my new 33.8 supply of Hydrate shampoo has changed from the last and is no longer great. Scent is missing; shampoo is thicker and lighter in color, and it leaves my hair too soft, limp and difficult to manage. Never again will I buy this product! Why do large corporations always ruin a good thing?"
1,Price went Waaaaay up. 11/09 was $36.44. Why is it $51 now (3/2010)??,"I love this shampoo. But what is up with the huge price increase?When I bought this same item (same size) in November of 2009, it was $36.44. Now it is $51?The shampoo market is too competitive for customers to continue buying if there's a 40% markup."
3,Boggle on the beach ..it rocks!,"My boyfriend and I, both in our 30's, played this on the beach for hours..we even had a stranger, who was sitting nearby with his friends and coveting our game, come and ask to play. It's so easy to whip out and start playing and it gets your mind working. Boggle rules. However, this particular set is way over-priced considering I also paid shipping. It's cheap and plastic and the letters don't fall neatly into the grooves. It's worth about 5 bucks but I paid over 20. Still, until the plastic cracks, I'm getting a lot of use out of it and making everyone at the beach jealous."
5,"Fast paced, educational, and fun!","This game allows you to throw all caution to the wind as you seek out chains of letters that make words of 3 or more letters in length. Shaking the letter cubes makes it virtually certain that no two rounds will ever be the same -- there are simply too many permutations.Not only does the competition get intense, but there's the chance to learn new words as you strain to come up with likely combinations that actually ARE words. That's how I learned such helpful words as scurf, scree, and jape.This game is affordable, immediately playable, and lots and lots of fun. It doesn't take all night to play a game, but you can play as long as you want.Great stuff, faster than Scrabble, and in some ways more of a challenge.5 stars all the way!"
5,A game for the ages!,"Boggle is one of the greatest word games ever, no question. It's faster, more entertaining, and more fair than the popular alternative game Scrabble. Do yourself a favor: buy it and play it with everyone you know. Also, consider getting a cheap digital timer (or just use the alarm function on a digital watch or cellphone) to time the rounds so you don't have to constantly look back and forth at the included hourglass. 'Nuff said."
5,My husband and I are addicted!,"We just discovered this game during the Christmas season and played it non-stop for a month before we both agreed we need to take a break. It is challenging personally and competitively - it's never the same. It's also a quick game when you don't have a lot of time (you can agree to do just a certain amount of rounds or for a certain amount of time). We also take it with us on trips since it's easy to transport. We love it - it will become one of our ""permanent"" games that we will always play for future years."
4,Boggle,Everything was great except it doesn't seem like the timer is the original timer. It doesn't have a stand and it seems to go too fast.
5,Best game ever invented,"I feel silly writing a review of a classic like this. But I've found a lot of people who've never even played Boggle! As an adult player, I could write volumes on why it is fun, but more importantly, it has huge educational value. Including.1. Teaches spelling, of course2. Teaches vocabulary. During scoring you see the words that other people came up with. I've learned so many words that way, it isn't funny.3. Teaches quick thinking. This game is all about speed. That's what makes it fun and challenging.You can handicap the game, for instance, adults have to find words of 5+ letters while kids play 3+ letters, so that people of different ages can play together."
5,A truly great game,"Boggle is extremely challenging, especially if you are playing against highly-skilled opponents. Boggle is much more fair than games that have each competitor roll their own dice or draw letters from a stack. Having every player work from the same letters means the result is always based upon knowledge and skill and never upon who got the best roll or draw.(...)"
1,4x4 grid is too boring,"I was introduced to this game 30 years ago. It's one of my favorites of all time, but not in the traditional 4x4 grid. 4x4 is too darn boring and repetitious. The only game worth playing is Big Boggle with the 5x5 grid. Luckily we have one of these from many years ago, and I live in terror that it might get lost, or the cubes might vanish. If so I'll have to give up Boggle forever I guess, as Big Boggle is no longer available anywhere at a reasonable price, and regular 4x4 Boggle is not worth playing.But I can't understand why Big Boggle is no longer marketed. It's the best ever. It seems you can buy it in the UK, but they won't ship it to the US. Are Americans considered too stupid?"
5,One of my favorites,"OK, I'm a nut for word games, but Boggle has always been one of my favorites. It's fast-paced and varied - even the same letters in different places make a whole new game. Any kid old enough to recognize words can play, but no one is too old for it. Highly recommended.-- wiredweird"
5,fun and fast!!,"This is a fun and fast game that people who enjoy word games such as Scrabble will really love. Not quite as ""academic"" as something like Scrabble, since you don't need to know definitions, the words aren't that long, and there is less strategy involved, but what it lacks in that aspect, it makes up for in a really fun and competitive game. Love that it moves so fast and it's fun to see people really get into it and get very competitive."
4,Keeping Brain Cells Alive with Words,"I truly enjoy this game. I play Boggle on the Computer but at times when a computer is not available, this game just fits the day like magic.It's a good test of your vocabulary too.I would recommend this product to adults and kids alike."
3,What happened to Big Boggle?,"""Baby Boggle,"" as my family calls it, is fun and somewhat challenging. It's difficult to play, though, after having played ""Big Boggle,"" which is like ""Baby Boggle,"" except it is 5 x 5 letters instead of 4 x 4. You get it? It seems like a child's game. It is less exciting, less challenging, less of a mental exercise and probably less educational. One can only guess at why Parker Brothers replaced the adult game with this puny version. Are we Americans just not up to 5 letter + words? At least they could have given us a choice. I've been searching and bidding on Big Boggle games for a year now. They sell on-line for up to $50.00 because of their rarity. Why? Why? Why? Eventually I'll probably have to fork over the big bucks to get the big game. In the meantime, there is always (sigh) ""Baby Boggle.""...END"
2,Yawn......wake me when it's over..........,"This game has some nice graphics and it boasts 30 on screen characters at one time with no slow down. Sounds good, but this game is way to repetitive. By the second level, I couldn't take it anymore. Save your money and rent this one first."
3,OK game...,"Not a great game. But good. What's so bad about it? Well, first it's not much variety in the game. All you do is fight, with the same moves all the time. Fight fight fight...you can easily kill over 300 enemies in one stage. How boring!Graphics are ok also. There's no slowdown. However, you cannot see much ahead of you...Bottom line, if you like to sit there for hours and just ""fight"" with the same moves over and over again, then so be it."
2,I don't get it.,"You walk around, plowing through enemies with your weapon of choice while a hundred other on screen characters run around like chickens without heads or just stand there like zombies. The landscapes are boring and the infamous 'fog' that won't let you view past a certain point is thick. Hack, cut, heeyah, repeat. Hack cut, heeyah, repeat. Fun? No, boring."
1,This is a rental game!,"I'll give this game a star for it's production values, but everything else comes up very short.First it plays like double dragon, but with less interaction, you can't really pick up new weapons (besides the long range ones) and your selection of attacks is very small.The A.I. of your enemies and comrades is pitiful, soldiers often stand around with very little agressive behavior, and bosses can be cheap. Think Luigi in Mario Kart (kudos to those that get it)And if you want replay value, look elsewhere, this game has five stages, and though the difficulty shoots up quickly, that's simply a cheap tactic to stretch the game out.This is a game to rent when you want to impress non serious gameplayers with graphics, or when you're home sick with a cold and need a brainless diversion. Because put simply, the fun lasts for maybe an hour."
3,wow the graphics are pretty good,i have beaten easy in only a few hours..so the game is pretty short. The sheer amount(30) of characters with different weapons is outstanding. The only drawback is the limmited number of attacks and repetitive hack and slash. If you like brawling games this is a good choice
5,Great Game,"When I bought my PS2, I was playing this game at the store on the PS2 they had set up and I thought it was alot of fun. So when I bought the console, I bought this game too. As soon as I got home and set it up, I started playing. The games graphics are perfect compared to some other PS2 games they had set up. It looks like you're watching yourself on TV. The only bad thing about it is that you can jump 10 feet high and that makes it seem a little unreal. Another thing, make sure that you have a memory card if you buy it because you will need to save alot."
5,Nice Massive Army Smashing Classic!,"For a launch PS2 game, I must say that this is a game that excels in many different ways. The gameplay is simplistic and immersing at the same time as you are fighting an entire opposing army at once with enemy soldiers surrounding the player, and you have to be quick and precise about eliminating them or they can deal some real damage to the player, and you have to kill the entire army in levels in a matter of 90 minutes or less, or else its game over; that however adds quite a bit to the challenge factor of this game, but it can be very frustrating to some players as this game is mainly about clearing a massive number of soldiers in a specific time limit. If having a time limit and crowds of soldiers surrounding the player doesn't bother you then I highly recommend this army-smashing classic, as it will keep you on the edge of your seat for 16 levels!"
3,"Fun, but...","This game is really fun, but it seems like the whole war is up to you, the other groups aren't as effective as they could be with a little more AI work. And it gets really repetative just hacking your way through hundreds of little dudes that all look the same... If your troops stayed with you instead of lagging behind it would cut down on getting mobbed by the enemy, the only big difficulty in this game."
3,"Fun, But Looooooong","-Chad Steingraber--Paradigm/Infogrames--Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate-At this point, Dynasty Warriors 3 is out....there is really no need to even play this one. DW3 is far better with improved gameplay and even multiplayer mode. Don't waste even a rental fee on this, if you really want to see DW2 play....just get DW3, there's not much difference. It's not that it isn't fun or cool...it's just that DW3 is the same thing packed with more fun. The problem I have with this one is, it takes over an hour to beat one level....and there really isn't any save points. That can be aggravating if you don't have a full hour to waste.Unless your really bored, want to waste your money....or just crazy insane for the series....don't bother with this one at all."
3,Button Masher Dream,"This game has wonderful graphics and movement. HOWEVER, there is way too much button pushing for me. If you like to kill 300 people in 10 minutes, this game is good for you. It requires very little strategy and skill to kill people. The game would be much better if it required the use of some strategy. You are thrown in a middle of a war and you just start killing as many people as you can. You do have to make some strategic moves such as killing the bow men on walls and try to keep your body guards alive. Overall my fingers started hurting after an hour and the game got a little old. But like I said if you like to push a lot of buttons and love graphics, you will love this game. One positive part of the game is the history lesson, I did learn a lot. I would definitely suggest renting it for a few days first. I loved it the first 2 days, but quickly grew sick of it after that."
2,Um...so what is the big deal anyway?,"I rushed out and rented this game after reading the reviews on this site. Anxious to try a game compared to the likes of ""Kessen"" by the same company, I have to say that I am pretty disappointed.But this game seems like it was cloned from the PS1 version in a big hurry to get to market. The graphics look very super-imposed on their background, and the fighting is very unrealistic, in the sense that you can just jump into a crowd of people and start swinging away --- including not even harming your own teammates. (Can we have a tiny bit of realism here?) The character auto-animation is odd...characters just take random lobs at each other instead of actually fighting. Finally, there are very limited moves to choose from.If you must have this game, please rent it first."
4,plays good looks great,"I got this game with my PS2 and well I'll tell ya its alot of fun. Basicly you just run around and kill everyone in sight,what more could you ask for. Don't get cocky though, this game gets harder as you play, but only in the sence that it takes more hits to kill the enemy, and there are alot more of them, oh, and arches, those ... arches. The downside is that there are not alot of moves per character, which makes it repetitious, other than that its good accept there is alittle slowdown when things get crowded."
5,I just love it.,This game rocks. You can execute so many people in this game without raising. I had alott of fun mastering it. I also like the history backrounds. If get your person to max stats. If love action and fighting this is for you.PS:[ This game was based on a book.]
3,Not the best album.,"Last year I saw Nek-Romantix live and I was disappointed. The songs they performed are on that album too. Sorry, but the band that can't play their songs live is not a good band.There are few catchy songs on that album. Who Killed The Cheerleader?, Nice Day For A Ressurection, and Trick Or Treat, for example. But the problem is that these guys really wanna show how fast they can play. And on the concert they are trying to be even faster. The only really slow down numbers on this album are Subcultural Girl that has stupied lyrics and Return Of The Loving Dead that is a ghoul country song.Tiger Army's Nick 13 is a big fan of this band and they made a few appeareances together. And probably Tiger Army are the one that follows their formula. But Nick 13 is much better singer and great songwriter what you can not say for The Nek-Romantix.Better for you to buy the next band's Dead Girls Don't Cry album."
1,",","This is the that wrote a song asking about ""were do monsters go to pee?"" 6000 years of human civilization and this is the best they can come up with."
5,This album is great.,"This album is f'n great. It's infectious, just like a zombie plague. This album got me interested in psychobilly and now I'm into all sorts of psycho bands, psychobilly is awesome! Ingnore the negative reviews, I have all their albums and this is one of the best. Nekromantix will always rule! Also, check out the Meteors, Demented Are Go, Mad Sin, Tiger Army, and Godless Wicked Creeps for some more good psycho. Stay psycho, stay sick!"
3,A few listens and it gets better!,This new Nekromantix CD is about what I expected. On first listen I was fairly dissapointed but now I listen to it a lot. The tracks are actually quite strong. My only problem is the Double Bass sound. Psychobilly music needs that slap bass slappin' sound to give it the edge. Seems like Kim (bass/vocals) has watered down the bass on this CD. Very sad if he has because that's what gives Psychobilly it's cool sound. If you want to hear a great band with a great upright slap bass sound then check out Mad Sin.
5,nekromantix,"they are really good. One of my favorite psychobilly (with the quakes). it seems everyone hears of these guys through tiger army, but i didn't. personally i hate tiger army. also don't take their lyrics seriouslly (same with all psychobilly)."
1,the Nekromantix sell out,"All I have to say is I'm glad my girlfriend bought this CD instead of me, I would've been [mad] if I spent any money on it. This is the sixth full length CD (one of which is live) from one of the greatest psychobilly bands, but what happened to them. Their sound got slower, watered down, and the lyrics are some of the stupidist I've ever heard. Subcultural Girl is probably the worst song on the CD. I tried to give this CD a chance but it hasn't grown on me. The only decent song on it is ""Nice day for a ressurection"", but the live version of it on the ""UNDEAD'N'LIVE"" CD is much better. If you want to hear some good Nekromantix I would suggest their first release ""Hellbound""(if you can find it), or their second release ""Curse of the Coffin."" This release shows that the Nekromantix are in it for the money and will change their style to get it. What a waste!"
2,Cheap and poorly edited,This magazine seems very cheesy to me. It is full of ads and has many typos. The 'stories' and articles were thrown together. It seems like each issue may have had 1 or 2 very small articles that were useful. I also noticed that after I subscribed to this magazine I started receiving all kinds of solicitations in the mail from different 'Start Your Own Business' companies. I'm positive they sell subscribers names.
3,not (just) a pretty face,"Don't be put off by HOME BUSINESS magazine's crammed look and its heavy advertisement content.'Fact is, you get what you pay for. These features are what make this small-article publication cheap and easy to come by.The magazine majors on the kind of one-off submissions that get sent in by aspiring writers and home entrepeneurs eager to cash in on their experience.But that's not a bad thing. Many of us trying to accomplish entrepeneurial stuff in the same space we live in do well to harvest the occasional gems. It's not WAR AND PEACE, but it doesn't claim to be.I like it."
5,Amazing Book,"As hard as it is to believe that a book about physicscould be riveting, I was unable to put this book down onceI started reading it. If you have even the least bit ofinterest in how the universe is put together, you'll findthis book facinating. Leon Lederman is a master at relatingphysics to laypeople in a way that they can understand."
5,Incredible ... Informative ... Interesting,"This is the best particle physics book I have ever read. It was incredibly, informative and even more interesting. It explained concepts with ease that I didn't understand after reading half a dozen others books on the same subject. I couldn't put it down. I started reading it after working three 20-hour days in a row and decided I would spend my 3-hour break reading instead of sleeping. I never thought a non-fiction book could make me do that."
4,Engaging text and physicist,"Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Rutherford, and Einstein are just a few of the heroes in Lederman's tale, each one a brilliant detective looking for clues behind the veil of matter.Extraordinarily accessible, filled with razor-sharp wit and startling storytelling power, The God Particle is a celebration of human curiosity, inviting you to take part in an adventure, finding the solution to a puzzle that will be the greatest discovery of all time.What Stephen Hawking did for cosmology, Leon Lederman does for particle physics."
5,"This is physics, but not as we know it Jim...","Lederman spends the first third of this book reviewing physics, from Greek times to the early part of this century; the second third focuses on the more recent history of particle accelerators - in which Lederman himself plays a part. All this is a necessary and fascinating preface to the final third - an exploration of the frontiers of knowledge in the exploration of the fundamental building blocks of nature, in which Lederman quietly pokes fun at physicists' attempts to find the answer to life, the universe, and everything - which they suspect might be very simple and beautiful, and at least partly to do with the God Particle - the Higgs Boson - a (so far) theoretical particle/force (I am not a physicist, so I can get away with this description) which gives mass to everything in the universe.If reading this does not get you excited about physics, nothing will. I look forward to an update, Mr. Lederman - have you found Higgs yet?"
3,Decent Physics Book,"This book is a good physics book, however (there's always a however)if you know anything about particle physics or quantum theory it probably is not worth reading. The book is very slow moving. Taking a painfully long time to explain trivial concepts and when it finally gets interesting there is a lot of hand waving involved. If you know absolutely nothing about physics, then read this book. If on the other hand, you got a well rounded education then I would have to suggest a different book."
3,As elusive in this book as in the real world,"As with most physics books we get a history lesson of the long road of discoveries that has led up to our current point in research, in this case the higgs boson. The history section is probably one of the best written in physics books but unfortunately that's not why I had read the book. The section that actually concerns the title of the book is actually pretty small. The second part of the book is more concerned with the authors history with Fermi lab, winning the nobel prize, interesting anecdotes and some friendships with other physicists. The God particle subject is very elusive in this book, as it is in the real world."
4,An educational treat.,If your physics education stopped in high school as mine did this book is a fantastic read. The first edition was given to me to read by my dear friend and neighbor who is world class physicist recently retired. He's worked as a lead physicist on several of the collider projects mention in the book. I feel like I've had a tutored high level course in particle physics. There's also a great history of the growth physical understanding throughout the past centuries leading to the discovery of the now known particles of the atom and the research goes on. Part of this research is on controllable fusion which could go a long way to solving the worlds energy needs.
3,"solid, readable work","Ralph Waller provides a valuable service with his short portrait of John Wesley. Beginning with a chronological presentation he shifts focus shortly after his Moravian experience to focus more on themes such as predestination, opposition, the nature of being a traveling preacher, and social concerns. Waller brings the results of excellent scholarship into a solid, readable work. An excellent introduction to Wesley's thought and life."
1,Not a good pen,"We bought a few boxes of the Bic Atlantis 1.2 pens for our office. They put small globs of ink on the page that smear frequently. It's especially bad for those of us who print. The more strokes you make picking up and putting it back down on the paper, the worse the globbing gets. I don't like the way the cap fits on the end of the pen when you're writing, either. (Small thing, I know.) They have a rubberized grip that is comfortable to write with, and they write fairly smoothly. But, the globbing is a deal-breaker."
2,Highly disappointed,"As a major fan of trivial pursuit, I was very much looking forward to the millennium edition. We played it the first night we received it and it was very disappointing. We have Genus IV edition, and there were many questions that were copied word for word from that edition. The questions were much easier than past editions and certainly did not cover the whole millennium. That's just the questions. The card box is entirely too small, not to mention ugly. Also, when you have to pass it from person to person, you can glimpse the answers on the picture cards. I would not recommend this game to any trivia buffs, as the earlier editions offer the same questions in a better package."
2,"Mediocre, Milleninnium Mess!","Don't fall for the marketing hype or the attractive pie shapedtin. This edition is fair at best. The sports catagory is awful, elvisquestions too plentiful and the history only goes back to WWII! I love to play trivail pursuit, but was greatly disappointed with the questions. Many are very vague and had repetitive subjects. The card holder is too small and awkward for the cards. The transparent pieces caused several near fights because the colors were had to discern. I do not recommend this edition..for the misleading marketing and poor design of this Millennium Mess!"
3,A pretty box....,"I would never recommend this version of Trivial Pursuit to a die-hard pursuiter like myself. Yes, the questions are interesting, and I found some even humourous, but there's aren't enough of them! I've owned this game a mere 3 weeks, and I find myself repeating questions. Yes, I'm sure this game is a blast if you play it once a month, but for someone like me, it's a pain not having enough questions."
4,Educational toy for kids 9-99!,"Trivial Pursuit is one of the oldie but goodies. It is fun for all ages and is a good game to tie parents and their children both into. Many times you see commercials about how families should be spending more time together; well, with Trivial Pursuit, you can! And it's very durable, so the investment in the game will pay off for it will last a long, long time!"
1,Worst game I ever played,No need to be smart to play. All you got to do is be a couch potato. Needs more questions that make u think.
1,Don't buy unless you are a tv and news fanatic,The questions were way too hard. The history and science questions were the only ones even half interesting. The other questions were next to impossible unless you are a television fanatic and can remember everything that happened in teh last millenium
4,A teen's perspective,"I think this is a really fun game to play with friends, especially with teams. I agree that many of the questions are easier than the earlier editions, but this can make it more enjoyable to play as well. I think it can be very educational, however how educational depends on how seriously you play. I have personally learned a lot of useless but fun information playing it."
1,Another Trivial Pursuit Ripoff,"Nifty packaging, but disappointing. Questions from the past 1000 years? Forget it. Mostly dumbed down media questions -- do you really care about Pamela Anderson's biography? Looks like those of us who loved the original and played it until we knew the questions by heart will have to give up TP. Would be nice if somebody came up with another edition that requires 1/2 a brain. Don't waste your $$$ on this turkey."
3,Nothing special.,"I am a lifelong player of Trivial Pursuit, I was very disappointed with this newest edition. It no longer has a Literary category and the Sports and Leisure category is terrible! All of the information is from recent history with only a few questions going back as far as WWII. I had hoped that the ""millenium"" edition would cover the millenium. I was wrong."
5,Great game for the common sense crowd,"This is by far the best Trivia Pursuit version I've played, because the questions are interesting and relevant. While it always helps to be a factoid whiz, you won't need to be one to play and win this version. I do agree with other reviews that the pie colors are a little odd (two are so similar that it's tricky to tell them apart), but when you finally win a pie, do you really care? I highly recommend this game."
5,Great new edition,"Although more questions in this edition deal with the 20th century than not, the Millennium edition is still challenging and fun. You don't have to have a giant brain to play this game -- educated guesses get you a long ways, and there are still plenty of questions about familiar things like ""Cheers"" and McDonalds and soccer. The metal container is quite sturdy and should far outlive the cardboard boxes that hold our other board games."
2,Don't believe the hype!! It's not at all what it promies!,The average intellect will not know the answers to 90% of these absurd questions. There is more t.v. and music trivia than educational trivia. Don't waste your hard earned money on this box of trash!
2,"Inappropriate for kids/teens, and very difficult!","Unfortunately, this is my first edition of trivial pursuit. I'm a 20-something honors college student...and I found this very difficult. Not only were the questions incredibly difficult, but it is absolutely inappropriate for children or teenagers! There are numerous questions and answers you would cover your children's ears for... I think the age range should start at 18. Or 50, because without a degree or life experience in world history back to at least the 1800s, any normal person wouldn't be able to answer more than 5% of these questions!"
2,"I'm not a trivial buff at all, but I was able to win pies.","I got this as a gift too, so I'm glad I didn't spend money for this. This game's questions are for those that are NOT trivial buffs. Most of these questions were more like general knowledge, for those who don't normally play trivial pursuit. Those geniuses would probably get bored with this version. The pie colors are hard to distinguish."
5,Every time you play it's a totally different game!,I like this edition and the original genus edition best. I like the design of the millenium edition as well as the occasional picture clue references. This game really brings our family together for some HEALTHY competition! I really like it
1,Disappointing,We love the paper bag princess. I ordered Mortimer for my two year old for Christmas think it would be the same quality. When the book arrived in mail I read through it and was really disappointed. It's just dumb. I ended up not giving it to my daughter.
5,Always a hit with my kindergartners!,"""MORTIMER"" combines a familiar and hilarious story with a repetitive format that always appeals to my kindergarten students. Each year, I read ""MORTIMER"" to my class. We follow up with choral reading and creative dramatics. Students are selected to portray Mortimer, Mom, Dad and the two police officers. Other classmates double as the seventeen brothers & sisters, and the audience. Everyone 'thumps' up & down the stairs and sings the refrain. My students read and reread this beloved book. Thanks to Robert Munsch and Mortimer, I am able to foster a lifelong love of literature. ""MORTIMER"" is a staple in our classroom library."
4,Great Value!!!,"I recently bought this ring for my fiance. It is a beautiful ring and was much less expensive than what we saw at local jewlry stores. I highly recomend this product.I was however shipped the incorrect size, however I was reimburssed for the cost of having it resized at a local store. Dispite the problem with the ring size, I received great customer service and prompt replies."
4,Jolt Gum,Great stuff when you need to get moving fast. A lot easier than trying to drink a cup of coffee on the way to work! I also like it in the afternoon when I feel like I need a little push.
1,Make certain you have the address and speed set.....,"I have not yet tried the product. I ordered it on a Saturday morning to the wrong address. I make this careless mistake all the time because I'm often not at my default address. I went to change it and got ""This portion of your order is being prepared for shipment and cannot be canceled or changed,"" Less than five minutes after placing this order. Beware."
5,"Beautiful, smooth, mellow, breezin, cd!","beautiful, smooth, Mellow, breezin, is all I can think of when I listen to this saxytress music, and the Vocals are superb! truly awesome music. the traxz are simply mind-blowing. And the way she plays is awesome, I recommend this to all smooth jazz lovers out there, a must! l have all her cds and l love them all."
4,Great book for entrepreneurs.,A good book detailing the rise and riches of Richard Branson. A truly good book for entrepreneurs.
2,Not the solution we hoped for,"We were hoping to get rid of all the runners in our kitchen and hallway, since our lab won't walk on the laminate floor. Once in a while she slips, then won't walk anywhere. She WILL walk on the floors with the hott doggers on, but they don't stay on very well. After two days I was tired of putting them on 5 or 6 times a day and gave up. Back to the runners."
2,Adequate but serious design flaws,"I have a German Shepherd that drags his hind toes [to the point of ""quicking"" his nails] and planned to use these on his back feet while on our pool deck. On first use, when I apply them as tight as possible, they do stay on; however they immediately spun so he was walking on the fabric side, not the ""bottom"". I then sewed the Velcro strap across more of the boot, thinking that would help it stay on properly. It didn't - they still spin around. He has now worn through the fabric side. I'll have to see what other modifications can be made to try and keep them right side up. I expected them to wear out but not within 3 uses of about 30 minutes each.On the positive side, he is not bothered by them at all and they do stay on, even during/after swimming. If I were to order again, I would go a size smaller. I used the suggested measurement procedure and ordered the large, but think a medium would definitely go on and maybe eliminate some of the other issues."
4,Eyepatch,"I purchased this because I needed an eyepatch while doing astronomy. It serves its purpose but feels a little flimsy and will probably not last long. I am content with it, I think it was a little expensive at $6 though."
4,Great Songwriter!,"I ordered this cd after hearing another artist recommend Dayna Kurtz, and what a great surprise! Her songwriting skills far surpass any of those chart-topping ladies (Alanis Morrisette, Sheryl Crow, etc.), and her voice is beautiful, unusual and skilled. The only thing that holds her back slightly are some of the musical arrangements-at times they bury her in the mix, and seem to plod along at an unnaturally slow pace. She's credited with guitar playing, but on several songs the guitar is lost behind muddy percussion and overt electric guitar. Standout tracks include ""Somebody Leave A Light On"", and ""Postcards From Downtown"". Though I long to hear this artist record a solo album, this one is still well worth the purchase. I predict great things ahead for this worthy talent!"
1,Not what I expected,"Remember this magazine having decent articles, but now the content is only ho-hum. Ads outnumber content and sadly that seems to be the norm among all magazines these days."
2,Not much too it,Every now and then there's a good recipe. But it takes me about 9 minutes to read through the whole mag.
3,Newer format makes this no longer a unique product,"My grandmother and mother both subscribed to this magazine and I grew up reading it. Over the last 10+ years this has morphed from being a unique THICK magazine that you could read over several days to one that can be flipped through in a short time, then recycled. It now contains largely the same type of information, articles and stories as numerous other magazines out there. My sister dropped this a number of years ago and I contemplate it every time my subscription comes up. It has gone from being a magazine I looked forward to receiving to one where I look at it when I get around to it."
4,Will Save You the Subscription Price in Tips,"I subscribe to Good Housekeeping because the magazine is full of consumer advice and tips, that alone has saved me well over the cost of the magazine.Good Housekeeping is a trusted name that tests and reviews products making their own suggestions, giving them the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.I have received so many good savings websites and tips that I keep subscribing just to save money."
1,Won't renew,"I'm done buying this magazine. I got this magazine on sale for a $5.00 subscription and they aren't even worth that. The cover stories are so boring. Also, too much advertising. I find myself just flipping through with no interest to read it These are going in the garbage."
5,I love this magazine!,"This is a fantastic magazine that has stood the test of time. I have always loved the articles in Good Housekeeping, and I seem to love them more now that I am in my 30's. This is also a FAIRLY wholesome magazine, which I am thankful for. I do not care to see half naked women on the cover of magazines, and I don't have that problem with this one. I love the recipes & interesting articles! This is one of my favorite magazines of all time. I look forward to reading it for years to come!"
3,Magazine Perp,"I was a little dissappointed in the lack of meaningful content in this magazine. Remembering how it was in the past, it seemed to me that there were way to many ads."
3,"Okay magazine, lots of fluff","I am pretty addicted to girly magazines and while this one has some neat content and good variety, there is a lot of filler and the articles seem pretty short."
5,"Great magazine, great buy!",I subscribed to Good Housekeeping when Amazon had one of its $5.00 magazine subscription specials before Christmas. The magazine has always been one of my favorites and you cannot beat Amazon's price anywhere!
4,Typical Women's Magazine,"Lots of ads to sift through before getting to the articles. I like how they recommend particular products, but they feel biased as if the manufacturer paid for them. I would have given this 3 stars because it's pretty average, but I subscribed when Amazon ran a great sale. The savings bumped it up an extra star."
2,Glad I got it for $5,"I purchased this magazine because it was cheap ($5) and I was purchasing a different magazine for a gift. Its ok. As a 34 year old mother of two, I was hoping for a few more household hints. It seems a little too old for me. I prefer Real Simple...but of course you can't get that prescription for $5!"
1,Boring and Bad customer service,"This magazine is extremely boring and if ever it doesn't arrive don't think they will be sending another copy out(as most magazines do), they will tell you to speak to your local post office!!"
3,Okay magazine,"Every Good Housekeeping magazine looks the same. As usual, there's tons of ads. Decent magazine. I haven't really gotten much out of it though. It was a great price at Amazon.... I think I got it for like $6 or something like that. Not bad."
3,Recognise your subscribers!,What age are you aiming for?I have bought ypur recent magazine & the clothes featured are sizes 8-16 (max)Pleaaaaaase!!! If I wanted this sort of mag I'd borrow my younger friends magazines. BUT they would not be seen dead reading Good Housekeeping. Wise up. Feature larger sizes. If your fashion afficionados are that much out of touch (my friends say so) then they can come to me for advice
1,ms. marty wolf,I renewed my Mom's (Mrs. Clinton Monson) annual sub to Good HouseKeeping mag as well as my own (2 year) sub to Good HouseKeeping. What more do I need to write??
3,Good Housekeeping (2-year),"I have not received this yet, it is due to be sent after the holidays.For the basic price it is a steal.."
3,Retired,I'm not sure that this magazine is what I remembered. It seems more family oriented and even my granchildren are grown now.
3,Diasppointed,"When I received the Good Housekeeping magazine in the mail, I noticed that the cover looked rather bland. It certainly was not like what you would see on the covers on the magazine stands. When I visited my local store, I looked over the copy of the Good Housekeeping magazine they were selling. It contained more information on the cover, about the stories contained inside, in addition to the collectible poster that was located inside. Upon checking on the inside of the magazine, there indeed was more in the newstand magazine. I find it hard to believe that a publisher actually penalizes a consumer for being a loyal customer and purchasing a subscription to their magazine. Is it because the subscriptions cost less than the newstand price? What a shame. This is one person that will not subscribe again."
5,Best magazine for women,"The magazine surprised me by coming earlier than I expected. I love this magazine because it isn't overrun with ads and it has a little of everything - projects for mothers of school age and younger kids for holiday crafts, tips for keeping a house clean and organized, human interest stories and this is the only general magazine that I get that has short story fiction pieces in it."
4,The magazine,I enjoy the magazine and the price. Also how you automatically set it up for renewal. Thank you so much.
5,Great Mag!,i really enjoy this magizine alot. It has alot of great articles and some good recipes and ideas. I look forward to reading it every month and seeing what great stuff they have for us.
2,Very disappointed...,This is not the Good Housekeeping I remember. SPARSE. This mag used to be full of artticles and down to earth advice columns.
3,Lots of ads and at least 2 good articles . . . you be the judge,"This magazine is one of the cases where you ""get what you pay for"". The inexpensive subscription appears to be supplemented by the multitudes of ads that grace the covers of the magazines. That being said, I have renewed this magazine for another year. In each issue, despite the desperate pleas by various companies for me to spend my hard earned cash on frivolity, there are a few outstanding and helpful articles and vignettes that make this magazine worth while (for the money). There are cute ideas for painting kids rooms, or for organizing the house. Also, the product reviews are reasonable (we also get consumer reports . . . and there really isn't a comparison). In the end, $8.00 for a 12 issues seems right on the money. Any more then that and I wouldn't buy it!"
4,Its an okay read,"Seems like every magazine is the same. Someone losing weight, a few recipes, and few product reviews. Nothing really great."
1,Good Housekeeping Review,My subscription was for a year. But the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired. I would suggest people subscribe to Good Housekeeping directly instead.
5,"My Magazine, My Direction","Last year I foolishly dropped Good Housekeeping because my budget had to be tightened -- and couldn't wait to subscribe again. Of course, something else had to be dropped. I depend on Goodhousekeeping to keep abreast of trends in makeup, styles, and food. Being retired, I don't run out and buy to change my self and pantry, but I know what's going on around me and my friends. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that 3 of my favorite cosmetics line, Boots ""No. 7"", were selected as ""Best"" or ""Highly effective"" for my skin.One article I really look for tells me about product recalls -- very important. I will never again let my subscription lapse, and Amazon is the handiest way to keep it current."
3,"There are some good articles, and some bad advertisements.","My parents have this magazine and I usually look through it when I see it.Really, this magazine is FILLED with advertisements. I would say more than 50% of each issue are only advertisements. It's ridiculous. You're basically paying for pages that you don't need.The articles on the otherhand, are excellent. They provide plenty of information especially on new products."
3,Why do I pay for ads?,"It has nice content but out of 230 pages, 113 were ads. That's not even counting the smaller ones. I won't be renewing."
5,Fast!!!!,I got my first issue in less than a month from my order date. Amazing! I read this mag mostly for the holiday ideas and recipes and it is wonderful that they got the subscription started so quickly because now I won't miss the holiday issues.
4,Solid 3.5 stars,This is pretty good magazine and for the price of a $8 it is a steal. I give the magazine itself 3.5 stars and the price with it 4 stars. There are many good ideas in this magazine and one of the only magazines besides my favorite (All You) that offers normal clothes and normal stores. The past months articles on saving money were well thought out and were easy things to try. The idea of putting a filled bottle water in the back of your toilet to decrease how much water needed per flush was a great idea! The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the constant need to have celebrities on the front cover while the articles about them aren't direct interviews - just some statements made to other people here and there. Seems lame. Otherwise this is one of the better mom magazines out there.
1,Too many ads,"For a magazine that is OVER 95% ads, there are only a FEW coupons to tempt you to try the products. I don't think that I will renew my subscription."
3,ok I guess....haven't received it yet.,"I guess I would have to say that a magazine is a magazine; but, it is the service that might be different from organization to organization that sells them. I haven't received this magazine yet; so, I can't really comment."
1,Haven't Received It Yet,It's been 7 weeks and I still haven't gotten the first issue of my subscription. What's going on Amazon? You weren't slow in billing me.
5,Good price for Good Housekeeping,This is the best price I have ever found for this magazine so i purchased 2 gift subscriptions for less that the usual price for one.
